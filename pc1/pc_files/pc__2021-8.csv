Many of the molecular events, involved in NED, appear to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity and epigenetic modulation of 2 epigenetic drugs, such as the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) and the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), in 2 human CRPC cell lines with NED (DU-145 and PC-3).  Methods:   The effects of AZA and SAM on cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and genome-wide DNA methylation profiling have been evaluated.  Results:   Both drugs showed a prominent antitumor activity in DU-145 and PC-3 cells, through perturbation of cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of cell migration. AZA and SAM reversed NED in DU-145 and PC-3, respectively. Moreover, AZA treatment modified DNA methylation pattern in DU-145 cells, sustaining a pervasive hypomethylation of the genome, with a relevant effect on several pathways involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration, in particular Wnt/β-catenin.  Conclusions:   A relevant antitumor activity of these epigenetic drugs on CRPC cell lines with NED opens a new scenario in the therapy of this lethal variant of PC.""","""['Alessandra Dicitore', 'Maria Giulia Bacalini', 'Davide Saronni', 'Germano Gaudenzi', 'Maria Celeste Cantone', 'Giulia Gelmini', 'Elisa Stellaria Grassi', 'Davide Gentilini', 'Maria Orietta Borghi', 'Anna Maria Di Blasio', 'Luca Persani', 'Paolo Garagnani', 'Claudio Franceschi', 'Giovanni Vitale']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Neuroendocrinology""","""['c-MYC drives histone demethylase PHF8 during neuroendocrine differentiation and in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Elevated circulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) levels are associated with neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.', ""Demethylation of the miR-146a promoter by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine correlates with delayed progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer."", 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in castration resistant prostate cancer.

Methods:   The authors identified patients with modified National Comprehensive Cancer Network favorable (""low-intermediate"") and unfavorable (""high-intermediate"") intermediate-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2015 and initially managed with AS in the Veterans Health Administration database. They analyzed definitive treatment, disease progression, metastases, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and all-cause mortality by using cumulative incidences and multivariable competing-risks (disease progression, metastasis, and PCSM) or Cox (all-cause mortality) regression.  Results:   The cohort included 1007 men (African Americans, 330 [32.8%]; Whites, 677 [67.2%]) followed for a median of 7.7 years; 773 (76.8%) had low-intermediate-risk disease, and 234 (23.2%) had high-intermediate-risk disease.

Compared with non-tumor human prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells, the mRNA and protein levels of CHAC1 significantly decreased in two prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and 22RV1, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis (P<0.05). The cell viability and glutathione (GSH) levels were significantly inhibited in prostate cancer cells following overexpression of CHAC1 (P<0.01), while they were significantly increased in DU145 cells transfected with CHAC1 siRNA (P<0.05), but not in 22RV1 cells (P>0.05). The expression levels of several endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related factors were then measured by western blot analysis. Following transfection with plasmid overexpressing CHAC1, ER markers, BIP and CHOP levels, were significantly upregulated (P<0.01), while GSH co-treatment decreased this upregulation. In addition, CHAC1 protein levels were significantly upregulated in cells treated with a ferroptosis activator (P<0.05). A liperflo reagent was then used to determine intracellular lipid peroxide levels. The intracellular lipid peroxides levels were significantly increased following CHAC1-overexpression (P<0.05), while GPX4 protein levels were significantly decreased (P<0.01). The cell viability was significantly inhibited (P<0.001) even with 1 nM docetaxel (DTX) and a plasmid overexpressing CHAC1, while the effect of inhibition was not significant at 1 nM of DTX alone (P>0.05). This inhibition was also eliminated following the addition of a ferroptosis inhibitor. In summary, CHAC1 may inhibit cell viability and increase the sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to DTX. The cellular mechanism may involve the induction of ER stress and ferroptosis. The results of the present study identified a potentially novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer, which may be useful in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Saifei He', 'Miao Zhang', 'Ying Ye', 'Juhua Zhuang', 'Xing Ma', 'Yanan Song', 'Wei Xia']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['MITOL/MARCH5 determines the susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to doxorubicin-induced ferroptosis by regulating GSH homeostasis.', 'Sevoflurane Induces Ferroptosis of Glioma Cells Through Activating the ATF4-CHAC1 Pathway.', 'Dihydroartemisinin triggers ferroptosis in primary liver cancer cells by promoting and unfolded protein response‑induced upregulation of CHAC1 expression.', 'Transcriptomic Profiling of MDA-MB-231 Cells Exposed to Boswellia Serrata and 3-O-Acetyl-B-Boswellic Acid; ER/UPR Mediated Programmed Cell Death.', 'Heart failure and the glutathione cycle: an integrated view.', 'Ferroptosis: a novel regulated cell death participating in cellular stress response, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy.', 'Bromocriptine monotherapy overcomes prostate cancer chemoresistance in preclinical models.', 'Exploring a ferroptosis and oxidative stress-based prognostic model for clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'CHAC1 as a Novel Contributor of Ferroptosis in Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells with Oxidative Damage.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the predicted PCa and non-PCa mortality at the time of reclassification among men on AS, to identify clinical criteria for considering a transition from AS to watchful waiting (WW).  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients enrolled in a large AS program who experienced biopsy grade reclassification (Gleason grade increase) were retrospectively examined. All patients who had complete documentation of medical comorbidities at reclassification were included.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A validated model was used to assess 10- and 15-yr untreated PCa and non-PCa mortalities based on patient comorbidities and PCa clinical characteristics. We compared the ratio of predicted PCa mortality with predicted non-PCa mortality (""predicted mortality ratio"") and divided patients into four risk tiers based on this ratio: (1) tier 1 (ratio: >0.33), (2) tier 2 (ratio 0.33-0.20), (3) tier 3 (ratio 0.20-0.10), and (4) tier 4 (ratio <0.10).  Results and limitations:   Of the 344 men who were reclassified, 98 (28%) were in risk tier 1, 85 (25%) in tier 2, 93 (27%) in tier 3, and 68 (20%) in tier 4 for 10-yr mortality. Fifteen-year risk tiers were distributed similarly. The 23 (6.7%) men who met the ""transition triad"" (age >75 yr, Charlson Comorbidity Index >3, and grade group ≤2) had a 14-fold higher non-PCa mortality risk and a lower predicted mortality ratio than those who did not (0.07 vs 0.23, p < 0.001). The primary limitations of our study included its retrospective nature and the use of predicted mortalities.  Conclusions:   At reclassification, nearly half of patients had a more than five-fold and one in five patients had a more than ten-fold higher risk of non-PCa death than patients having a risk of untreated PCa death. Despite a more significant cancer diagnosis, a transition to WW for older men with multiple comorbidities and grade group <3 PCa should be considered.  Patient summary:   Men with favorable-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy of >10 yr are often enrolled in active surveillance, which entails delay of curative treatment until there is evidence of more aggressive disease. We examined a group of men on active surveillance who developed more aggressive disease, and found, nevertheless, that the majority of these men continued to have a dramatically higher risk of death from non-prostate cancer causes than from prostate cancer based on a risk prediction tool. For men older than 75 yr, who have multiple medical conditions and who do not have higher-grade cancer, it may be reasonable to reconsider the need for curative treatment given the low risk of death from prostate cancer compared with the risk of death from other causes.""","""['Mitchell M Huang', 'Ridwan Alam', 'Andrew T Gabrielson', 'Zhuo T Su', 'Borna Kassiri', 'Sean A Fletcher', 'Michael J Biles', 'Hiten D Patel', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Zeyad R Schwen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Quantifying the Transition from Active Surveillance to Watchful Waiting Among Men with Very Low-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Active Surveillance of Grade Group 1 Prostate Cancer: Long-term Outcomes from a Large Prospective Cohort.', 'Older Age Predicts Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy Grade Reclassification to Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Identification, Management, and Outcomes.', 'Treatment patterns and survival of low and intermediate-risk prostate cancer in end-stage kidney disease: A retrospective population cohort study.']"""

Given the potential for lifestyle or genetic variations between subsets of Asian-American men to impact prostate cancer behavior, we sought to define the outcomes after radical prostatectomy among various Asian groups treated at an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center.  Methods:   The City of Hope IRB-approved prostatectomy database was searched from 2003 to 2015 to identify Asian-American men. Clinical and pathologic features were collected and analyzed for association with biochemical recurrence-free survival and overall survival (OS). Categorical data were evaluated using χ2and Fisher's exact tests. Survival curves were compared between groups using log-rank testing.  Results:   Three hundred and eighty-three Asian-American men were included in the dataset. While Asian men as a group had lower BMI than African-American and white men in the database, there was a wide range between ethnic sub-groups. Chinese men more commonly presented with D'Amico low risk disease features (P= .04) compared to other Asian men. Pacific Islander men had the lowest rate of ≥T3 stage and the highest biochemical recurrence-free survival. OS for Chinese men was better than for all Asian patients combined (P= .046). After controlling for D'Amico risk and in multivariate analysis, Chinese men still had improved OS than other Asian men after prostatectomy (P= .03).

Bone-modifying agents (BMAs) delay SREs and SSEs. However, the real-world use of BMAs is debated given the absence of demonstrated survival advantage and potential adverse events (AEs). Our retrospective study examined BMA use and SSE rates in Australian patients with CRPC.  Methods:   Patients with CRPC and bone metastases were identified from the electronic CRPC Australian Database. Patient characteristics, treatment patterns and AEs were analysed. Descriptive statistics reported baseline characteristics, SSE rates and BMA use. Comparisons between groups used t-tests and Chi-square analyses. Overall survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   A total of 532 eligible patients were identified with a median age of 73 years (range: 44-97 years).

Embolisation is usually well tolerated under conscious sedation and can be repeated several times. Percutaneous thermoablation is a local ablative, usually curatively intended treatment for hepatic, renal and pulmonary tumors. As a minimally invasive technique, it competes against surgery and radiation therapy. There are different types of thermoablation, most commonly used are radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA) and cryo-ablation. Ablation is usually performed in general anesthesia, less common in conscious sedation. New interventional treatments are high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and irreversible electroporation (IRE).

Objective.—:   To evaluate the clinical utility of [-2]pro-prostate-specific antigen ([-2]proPSA) derivatives in detecting clinically significant PCa (csPCa) and to compare it with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and with the percentage of free PSA (%fPSA).  Design.—:   Two hundred thirty-seven men (PSA: 2-10 ng/mL) scheduled for a prostate biopsy were enrolled. Parametric and nonparametric tests, receiver operating characteristic curves, and logistic regression analysis were applied. Outcomes were csPCa and overall PCa.  Results.—:   Both [-2]proPSA derivatives were significantly higher in csPCa and overall PCa (P < .001). The areas under the curves for the prediction of csPCa were higher for the percentage of [-2]proPSA (%[-2]proPSA) (0.781) and the prostate health index (PHI) (0.814) than for PSA (0.651) and %fPSA (0.724). There was a gain of 11% in diagnostic accuracy when %[-2]proPSA or PHI were added to a base model with PSA and %fPSA. Twenty-five percent to 29% of biopsies could have been spared with %[-2]proPSA (cutoff: ≥1.25%) and PHI (cutoff: ≥27), missing 10% of csPCas. The same results could have been achieved by using [-2]proPSA as a reflex test, when %fPSA was 25% or less (cutoffs: ≥1.12% and ≥24 for %[-2]proPSA and PHI, respectively).  Conclusions.—:   The [-2]proPSA derivatives improve the diagnostic accuracy of csPCa when the PSA value is between 2 and 10 ng/mL, sparing unnecessary biopsies and selecting patients for active surveillance. [-2]proPSA can be used as a reflex test when %fPSA is 25% or less, without reducing the diagnostic accuracy for csPCa and the number of spared biopsies.""","""['Manuel M Garrido', 'José C Marta', 'Rui M Bernardino', 'João Guerra', 'Francisco Fernandes', 'Maria H Pereira', 'Ruy Ribeiro', 'Stefan Holdenrieder', 'Luís C Pinheiro', 'João T Guimarães']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['Serum isoform -2proPSA derivatives significantly improve prediction of prostate cancer at initial biopsy in a total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml: a multicentric European study.', 'Clinical performance of serum prostate-specific antigen isoform -2proPSA (p2PSA) and its derivatives, %p2PSA and the prostate health index (PHI), in men with a family history of prostate cancer: results from a multicentre European study, the PROMEtheuS project.', 'The prostate health index and the percentage of -2proPSA maintain their diagnostic performance when calculated with total and free PSA from different manufacturers.', 'From prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to precursor PSA (proPSA) isoforms: a review of the emerging role of proPSAs in the detection and management of early prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Utility of Prostate-Specific Antigen Isoforms and Prostate Health Index in the Diagnosis of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

We have previously found that treatment of prostate cancer PC3 cells with Teucrium persicum extract leads to the formation of small populations of epithelial cells. β-Catenin is a component of cell adherens junctions in epithelial cells and therefore, in this study, we have investigated the effect of Teucrium persicum extract on expression, cellular localization, and transcriptional activity of β-Catenin protein in PC-3 cells. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy results showed that the cells treated with T. persicum extract had higher levels of β-Catenin protein at the cell membrane. Western blotting experiments produced consistent results. Gene expression studies by using a few β-Catenin-target genes including c-MYC, CYCLIN D1, and a reporter Luciferase gene under the control of several β-Catenin/TCF binding elements showed that treatment of PC3 cells with the methanolic extract of T. persicum decreases the transcriptional activities of β-Catenin. The results of this study provide further support for the anticancer properties of T. persicum.

This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based automated OAR delineation method to tackle the current challenges remaining in achieving reliable expert performance with the state-of-the-art auto-delineation algorithms.  Methods:   The accuracy of OAR delineation is expected to be improved by utilizing the complementary contrasts provided by computed tomography (CT) (bony-structure contrast) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (soft-tissue contrast). Given CT images, synthetic MR images were firstly generated by a pre-trained cycle-consistent generative adversarial network. The features of CT and synthetic MRI were then extracted and combined for the final delineation of organs using mask scoring regional convolutional neural network. Both in-house and public datasets containing CT scans from head-and-neck (HN) cancer patients were adopted to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed method against current state-of-the-art algorithms in metrics including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD), and residual mean square distance (RMS).  Results:   Across all of 18 OARs in our in-house dataset, the proposed method achieved an average DSC, HD95, MSD, and RMS of 0.77 (0.58-0.90), 2.90 mm (1.32-7.63 mm), 0.89 mm (0.42-1.85 mm), and 1.44 mm (0.71-3.15 mm), respectively, outperforming the current state-of-the-art algorithms by 6%, 16%, 25%, and 36%, respectively. On public datasets, for all nine OARs, an average DSC of 0.86 (0.73-0.97) were achieved, 6% better than the competing methods.

Methods/patients:   Data from spine SBRT treatments performed at our institution between March 2012 and February 2020 was collected. Medical records, including demographic, primary tumor, and treatment characteristics were reviewed. Patient follow-up included clinical evaluation, imaging, and blood tests. Toxicity was recorded according to CTCAE v4.0.  Results:   We analyzed 73 consecutive spine SBRT treatments in 60 patients. 39.7% of the cases had primary breast cancer and 23.3% had prostate cancer. Most cases (87.7%) were treated with a single SBRT fraction of 16 Gy. Median follow-up was 26.1 months (range 1.7-78.6), and 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates were 96.9% and 84.2%, respectively. Local control (LC) rates at 1- and 2-years were 76.3% and 70.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified histology as a prognostic factor for both OS and LC.

Purpose To show the feasibility of using natural language processing (NLP) to gather accurate data from radiology reports for assessing spatial and temporal patterns of metastatic spread in a large patient cohort. Materials and Methods In this retrospective longitudinal study, consecutive patients who underwent CT from July 2009 to April 2019 and whose CT reports followed a departmental structured template were included. Three radiologists manually curated a sample of 2219 reports for the presence or absence of metastases across 13 organs; these manually curated reports were used to develop three NLP models with an 80%-20% split for training and test sets. A separate random sample of 448 manually curated reports was used for validation. Model performance was measured by accuracy, precision, and recall for each organ. The best-performing NLP model was used to generate a final database of metastatic disease across all patients. For each cancer type, statistical descriptive reports were provided by analyzing the frequencies of metastatic disease at the report and patient levels. Results In 91 665 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 61 years ± 15; 46 939 women), 387 359 reports were labeled. The best-performing NLP model achieved accuracies from 90% to 99% across all organs. Metastases were most frequently reported in abdominopelvic (23.6% of all reports) and thoracic (17.6%) nodes, followed by lungs (14.7%), liver (13.7%), and bones (9.9%). Metastatic disease tropism is distinct among common cancers, with the most common first site being bones in prostate and breast cancers and liver among pancreatic and colorectal cancers. Conclusion Natural language processing may be applied to cancer patients' CT reports to generate a large database of metastatic phenotypes. Such a database could be combined with genomic studies and used to explore prognostic imaging phenotypes with relevance to treatment planning. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Richard K G Do', 'Kaelan Lupton', 'Pamela I Causa Andrieu', 'Anisha Luthra', 'Michio Taya', 'Karen Batch', 'Huy Nguyen', 'Prachi Rahurkar', 'Lior Gazit', 'Kevin Nicholas', 'Christopher J Fong', 'Natalie Gangai', 'Nikolaus Schultz', 'Farhana Zulkernine', 'Varadan Sevilimedu', 'Krishna Juluru', 'Amber Simpson', 'Hedvig Hricak']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Natural Language Processing of Computed Tomography Reports to Label Metastatic Phenotypes With Prognostic Significance in Patients With Colorectal Cancer.', 'Natural Language Processing of Large-Scale Structured Radiology Reports to Identify Oncologic Patients With or Without Splenomegaly Over a 10-Year Period.', 'Developing a Cancer Digital Twin: Supervised Metastases Detection From Consecutive Structured Radiology Reports.', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'Discerning tumor status from unstructured MRI reports--completeness of information in existing reports and utility of automated natural language processing.', 'A scoping review of natural language processing of radiology reports in breast cancer.', 'Deep learning-based detection of patients with bone metastasis from Japanese radiology reports.', 'Natural Language Processing of Computed Tomography Reports to Label Metastatic Phenotypes With Prognostic Significance in Patients With Colorectal Cancer.', 'Outcomes and Molecular Features of Brain Metastasis in Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Natural Language Processing for Information Extraction of Gastric Diseases and Its Application in Large-Scale Clinical Research.']"""

Materials and methods:   We evaluated and compared SBRT plans from prostate cancer patients with and without rectal spacer who underwent treatment on a 0.35 T MRI-Linac. Each group consisted of 10 randomly selected patients that received prostate SBRT to a total dose of 36.25 Gy in five fractions. Dosimetric differences in planned and delivered rectal and bladder dose and the number of fractions violating OAR constraints were quantified. We also assessed whether adaptive planning was needed to meet constraints for each fraction.  Results:   On average, rectal spacing reduced the maximum dose delivered to the rectum by more than 8 Gy (p < 0.001). We also found that D3cc received by the rectum could be 12 Gy higher in patients who did not have rectal spacer (p < 9E-7). In addition, the results show that a rectal spacer can reduce the maximum dose and D15cc to the bladder wall by more than 1 (p < 0.004) and 8 (p < 0.009) Gy, respectively. Our study also shows that using a rectal spacer could reduce the necessity for adaptive planning. The incidence of dose constraint violation was observed in almost 91% of the fractions in patients without the rectal spacer and 52% in patients with implanted spacer.

The absence of intravascular lymphoma in the traditional sites and difference in mode of presentation with no mass forming lesion as compared to other lymphomas, makes it unique and difficult to diagnose early. It is extremely heterogeneous in its clinical presentation depending on the organ involved. Primary intravascular large B cell lymphoma of the prostate is extremely rare and only 8 cases have been reported in English literature till date, limited to single case reports. This is a rare case of a 76 year old male patient, who came with complaints of urinary obstruction and fever of unknown origin since 15 days.

Patient was catheterized and transurethral resection was done. On histopathological examination, prostatic acini and stroma were normal but the vessels in the stroma which were dilated and thin walled lacking a muscular coat, showed sheets of loosely cohesive cells with moderate eosinophilic to clear cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, with 1 to 3 prominent nucleoli and mitoses, averaging 4-6/hpf.

Oncogenic TMPRSS2:ERG (ERG+) gene fusions are facilitated by DNA breaks and occur in up to 50% of prostate cancers. Infection-driven inflammation is implicated in the formation of ERG+ fusions, and we hypothesized that these fusions initiate in early inflammation-associated prostate cancer precursor lesions, such as proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA), prior to cancer development. We investigated whether bacterial prostatitis is associated with ERG+ precancerous lesions in unique cases with active bacterial infections at the time of radical prostatectomy. We identified a high frequency of ERG+ non-neoplastic-appearing glands in these cases, including ERG+ PIA transitioning to early invasive cancer. These lesions were positive for ERG protein by immunohistochemistry and ERG messenger RNA by in situ hybridization. We additionally verified TMPRSS2:ERG genomic rearrangements in precursor lesions using tricolor fluorescence in situ hybridization. Identification of rearrangement patterns combined with whole-prostate mapping in three dimensions confirmed multiple (up to eight) distinct ERG+ precancerous lesions in infected cases. We further identified the pathogen-derived genotoxin colibactin as a potential source of DNA breaks in clinical cases as well as cultured prostate cells. Overall, we provide evidence that bacterial infections can initiate driver gene alterations in prostate cancer. In addition, our observations indicate that infection-induced ERG+ fusions are an early alteration in the carcinogenic process and that PIA may serve as a direct precursor to prostate cancer.""","""['Eva Shrestha', 'Jonathan B Coulter', 'William Guzman', 'Busra Ozbek', 'Megan M Hess', 'Luke Mummert', 'Sarah E Ernst', 'Janielle P Maynard', 'Alan K Meeker', 'Christopher M Heaphy', 'Michael C Haffner', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Karen S Sfanos']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Uro-Science.', 'Retention of Interstitial Genes between TMPRSS2 and ERG Is Associated with Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Inflammation-Induced Oxidative Stress Mediates Gene Fusion Formation in Prostate Cancer.', 'TMPRSS2:ETS fusions and clinicopathologic characteristics of prostate cancer patients from Eastern China.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.', 'The progress of TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions and their mechanism in prostate cancer.', 'The potential role of the microbiota in prostate cancer pathogenesis and treatment.', 'Prognostic Values of Gene Copy Number Alterations in Prostate Cancer.', 'An absolute approach to using whole exome DNA and RNA workflow for cancer biomarker testing.', 'Prevalence of genotoxic bacteria in men undergoing biopsy for prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Chemical-Disease Associations Through Integration of Molecular Fingerprint, Gene Ontology and Pathway Information.']"""

The present study examined treatment plans for prostate cases using beam-specific planning target volume (bsPTV) based on the effect of the markers on dose distribution and analysis of target movements.  Materials and methods:   Gafchromic EBT3 film was used to measure dose perturbations caused by markers. First, the relationships between the irradiated film density and absolute dose with different linear energy transfer distributions within a spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) were confirmed. Then, to derive the effect of markers, two types of markers, including GA, were placed at the proximal, center, and distal depths within the same SOBP, and dose distributions behind the markers were measured using the films. The amount of internal motion of prostate was derived from irradiation results and analyzed to determine the margins of the bsPTV.  Results:   The linearity of the film densities against absolute doses was constant within the SOBP and the amount of dose perturbations caused by the markers was quantitatively estimated from the film densities. The dose perturbation close behind the markers was smallest (<10% among depths within the SOBP regardless of types of markers) and increased with depth. The effect of two types of GAs on dose distributions was small and could be ignored in the treatment planning. Based on the analysis results of internal motions of prostate, required margins of the bsPTV were found to be 8, 7, and 7 mm in left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions, respectively.

Retrospectively, the various variables and predictors for the individual therapy decision were identified, and the preference was to compared with studies on survival and recurrence characteristics. The presentation of toxicity was not the focus of this work.  Methodology:   In all, 743 patients from a single center were enrolled according to biopsy/staging chronologically in the sequence of the initial consultation after clarification and informed consent: 494 patients were in the RPVE arm and 249 patients in the EBRT arm. We used retrospective data analysis with univariate and multivariate comparisons in the alternative therapy arms. Multivariate logical regression models were developed to objectify the allocation process. Univariate processing of survival analyses, the comparison of tumor- and comorbidity-specific mortality rates was co-founded.  Results:   Predictive variables for RPVE vs. EBRT therapy decision are significantly age, Gleason score, D'Amico index, Charlson index, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and prostate volume. There was no significance level for the biopsy score. The age gap was in the median 67 (RPVE) and 73 (EBRT) years. Overall survival (n = 734, 20 years, all risks) in the RPVE arm was 56.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 45.1-67.0%) and in the EBRT arm 19.2% (95%CI 9.2-31.8%). Comorbid risk was highly significantly (p < 0.0001) different (27.1% [95%CI 18.0-36.1%] in the RPVE arm, and 60.4% [95%CI 47.3-73.5%] in the EBRT arm). The risk of tumor-specific death at 16.2% (95%CI 8.1-24.4%) after RPVE and 20.5% (95%CI 11.7-29.3%) after EBRT was not significantly different (p = 0.2122, overlapping 95%CI). After stratification, a clear advantage can be demonstrated for the high-risk tumors after allocation to the RPVE arm.  Conclusions:   The complexity of the predictive variables of the PCA further complicates the individual therapy decision. According to our data, the higher D'Amico score, the rather low Charlson index, a high Gleason score and a higher organ volume speak for a valid therapy for RPVE.""","""['W -D U Böhm', 'R Koch', 'S Latarius', 'A Mehnert', 'C Werner', 'Manfred P Wirth']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urologe A""","""['Erratum zu: Zur Praxis der Therapieentscheidung beim lokal begrenzten Prostatakarzinom: Operation vs. Bestrahlung\xa0– wer profitiert? : Allokation und Ergebnisse einer unizentrischen, kumulativen Langzeitstudie.', 'Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as Predicting Marker for Clinical Outcome and Evaluation of Early Toxicity Rate after High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in Combination with Additional External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) for High Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Benefits and Risks of Primary Treatments for High-risk Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: An International Multidisciplinary Systematic Review.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiation therapy for high-grade, clinically localized prostate cancer: Emulation of a target clinical trial.', 'External beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.']"""

Piceatannol, scirpusin-B, dicaffeoylquinic acid, citric acid, and (+)-catechin were identified in PFBE, and the extract showed high in vitro antioxidant capacity. Some alterations in systemic parameters were verified during prostate cancer progression, as the increase in ALT and MDA levels, and SOD and GPx activities in the plasma. In the liver, higher MDA, TNF-α, and NF-κB levels, and GR and GPx activities were verified. Compared to their respective controls, the short- and long-term PFBE administration reduced MDA levels in the liver and plasma. The long-term treatment increased the catalase activity in the plasma, while the short-term treatment increased the hepatic SOD and catalase activities. Still, a reduction in hepatic TNF-α and NF-κB levels was verified after long-term treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Prostate cancer progression is associated with changes in systemic redox status and inflammation markers. Moreover, the intake of polyphenols with antioxidant properties, besides delaying prostate carcinogenesis, may improve the systemic antioxidant defenses and inflammatory response. In vitro studies pointed to a promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory potential of yellow passion fruit bagasse. However, in vivo studies are scarce. Our results provided information about in vivo impacts of PFBE oral consumption on antioxidant defense and inflammation, indicating its potential as an adjuvant during the initial steps of prostate cancer.""","""['Andressa Mara Baseggio', 'Larissa Akemi Kido', 'Juliane Viganó', 'Mara Junqueira Carneiro', 'Celina de Almeida Lamas', 'Julian Martínez', 'Alexandra Christine Helena Frankland Sawaya', 'Valéria Helena Alves Cagnon', 'Mário Roberto Maróstica Júnior']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Food Biochem""","""['Identification of the strong vasorelaxing substance scirpusin B, a dimer of piceatannol, from passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) seeds.', 'The protective effects of piceatannol from passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) seeds in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes.', 'Impact of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion on the bioaccessibility and antioxidant capacity of bioactive compounds from Passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) leaves and juice extracts.', 'Cardiovascular Protective Effects of Polyphenols Contained in Passion Fruit Seeds Namely Piceatannol and Scirpusin B: A Review.', 'Brazilian passion fruit as a new healthy food: from its composition to health properties and mechanisms of action.', 'Brazilian Berry Extract Differentially Induces Inflammatory and Immune Responses in Androgen Dependent and Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Dietary Polyphenols: Extraction, Identification, Bioavailability, and Role for Prevention and Treatment of Colorectal and Prostate Cancers.']"""

Western blot and qRT-PCR were adopted to detect CUL4B and miR-101-3p expressions in 75 cases with PCA . The cellular strains of PCA (LNCaP and PC3) were chose as the objects to check the targeting correlation between CUL4B and miR-101-3p through dual-luciferase reporter experiments. LNCaP cells and PC3 cells were randomly divided into the blank group, miR-101-3p mimic group, siRNA negative control (NC) group, CUL4B siRNA group and CUL4B siRNA plus the miR-101-3p inhibitor group. Cellular bioactivity measurement was done via Cell-Light EDU, MTT, Annexin-V-FITC/PI, scratch-heal experiments and invasion tests of Transwell. MiR-101-3p expression was decreased more signally in tumor tissues than in normal tissues adjacent to the cancer. MiR-101-3p inhibited cellular proliferating, migrating and invasion. Nevertheless, it promoted cellular apoptosis, up-regulated apoptotic proteins as well as down-regulated anti-apoptotic proteins. CUL4B siRNA and miR-101-3p simulation were similar in terms of their outcomes. Nonetheless, these results could be reversed through the miR-101-3p inhibitor. Besides, CUL4B siRNA and the simulation halted a serious of PI3K signal in PCA cells. MiR-101-3p expression was down-regulated in PCA patients. CUL4B was upregulated in PCA patients. Moreover, miR-101-3p suppressed cellular invasion, migration, proliferation and led to cellular apoptosis, which might be related to the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway suppression.

The main objective of this study is to analyze AURKA expression in 13 common cancers and its role in prognostic and drug resistance.  Method:   Using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) as well as CCLE and GDSC data, the level of AURKA gene expression and its role in prognosis and its association with drug resistance were evaluated, respectively. In addition, the expression level of AURKA was assessed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastric cancer (GC) samples. Besides, using Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data, drugs that could affect the expression level of this gene were also identified.  Results:   The results indicated that the expression level of AURKA gene in 13 common cancers increased significantly compared to normal samples or it survived poorly (HR >1, p < 0.01) in lung, prostate, kidney, bladder, and uterine cancers. Also, the gene expression data showed increased expression in CRC and GC samples compared to normal ones. The level of AURKA was significantly associated with the resistance to SB 505124, NU-7441, and irinotecan drugs (p < 0.01). Eventually, GEO data showed that JQ1, actinomycin D1, and camptothecin could reduce the expression of AURKA gene in different cancer cell lines (logFC < 1, p < 0.01).

HOXA11 antisense RNA (HOXA11-AS) was reported to serve an oncogenic lncRNA in cancers but its role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains to be explored.  Materials and methods:   Expression levels of HOXA11-AS in PCa tissues and cells were analyzed with quantitative Real-Time PCR method. MTT assay, colony formation assay, transwell invasion assay, and flow cytometry assay were conducted to explore the biological roles of HOXA11-AS in PCa. Rescue experiments were conducted to investigate mechanisms of HOXA11-AS in regulating PCa progression.  Results:   We revealed that HOXA11-AS was upregulated in PCa. Silencing of HOXA11-AS significantly inhibited PCa cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and promoted apoptosis in vitro. On the contrary, forcing of HOXA11-AS expression caused opposite effects on cancer cell behaviors.

It has prognostic and predictive therapeutic implications and is associated with aggressive prostate cancer (PCa).  Objective:   To investigate the prognostic value of ATM protein expression in PCa patients and assessed the combined value of ATM, ERG, and PTEN status.  Design setting and participants:   This study consisted of 303 patients with incidental, locally advanced, and castrate-resistant PCa by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   TURP samples from 303 PCa patients were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC for ATM, ERG, and PTEN. Individual and combined marker status were correlated with International Society of Urological Pathology Gleason grade group, overall survival (OS), and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results and limitations:   Decreased ATM expression (negative/weak intensity) occurred in 164/303 (54.1%) patients, and was associated with shorter OS and higher PCSM (p = 0.015 and p = 0.001, respectively). Negative/weak ATM expression was significantly associated with PCSM with a hazard ratio of 2.09 (95% confidence interval 1.34-3.27, p = 0.001). Assessment of Combined ATM/PTEN expression showed improved prognostic power to predict OS and PCSM, independent of Gleason grade groups.  Conclusions:   Decreased ATM protein expression is associated with poor outcomes in advanced PCa patients. Patients with combined low ATM/PTEN negative expression are at the highest risk for reduced OS and PCSM. Assessing the combined status of ATM/PTEN by IHC in PCa patients may aid in risk stratification relative to OS and PCSM. Moreover, since ATM plays an integral role in DNA damage response pathways, future studies will enhance our understanding of how outcomes of patients with altered ATM and PTEN expression can be improved further with poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), combinations of PARPi and androgen receptor-targeted therapies, as well as platinum-based chemotherapies.  Patient summary:   Lower ATM intensity is associated with increased cancer-specific mortality in prostate cancer patients. Patients with lower ATM and PTEN negative expression showed decreased overall survival and increased cancer mortality compared with controls.""","""['Simon R Walker', 'Ramy Abdelsalam', 'Sunita Ghosh', 'Julie Livingstone', 'Nallasivam Palanisamy', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Steven M Yip', 'Susan P Lees-Miller', 'Tarek A Bismar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol Open Sci""","""['High Serine-arginine Protein Kinase 1 Expression with PTEN Loss Defines Aggressive Phenotype of Prostate Cancer Associated with Lethal Outcome and Decreased Overall Survival.', 'Combined loss of TFF3 and PTEN is associated with lethal outcome and overall survival in men with prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic significance of combined ERG and androgen receptor expression in patients with prostate cancer managed by androgen deprivation therapy.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Candidate lncRNA and Pseudogene Biomarkers Associated with Carbon-Nanotube-Induced Malignant Transformation of Lung Cells and Prediction of Potential Preventive Drugs.', 'What Do We Have to Know about PD-L1 Expression in Prostate Cancer?

The curative potential of radiotherapy is mediated by irradiation-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in tumor cells. However, PCa radiocurability can be impeded by tumor resistance mechanisms and normal tissue toxicity. Metabolic reprogramming is one of the major hallmarks of tumor progression and therapy resistance. Specific metabolic features of PCa might serve as therapeutic targets for tumor radiosensitization and as biomarkers for identifying the patients most likely to respond to radiotherapy. The study aimed to characterize a potential role of glutaminase (GLS)-driven glutamine catabolism as a prognostic biomarker and a therapeutic target for PCa radiosensitization. Methods: We analyzed primary cell cultures and radioresistant (RR) derivatives of the conventional PCa cell lines by gene expression and metabolic assays to identify the molecular traits associated with radiation resistance. Relative radiosensitivity of the cell lines and primary cell cultures were analyzed by 2-D and 3-D clonogenic analyses. Targeting of glutamine (Gln) metabolism was achieved by Gln starvation, gene knockdown, and chemical inhibition. Activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) and autophagy was assessed by gene expression, western blotting, and fluorescence microscopy. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were analyzed by fluorescence and luminescence probes, respectively. Cancer stem cell (CSC) properties were investigated by sphere-forming assay, CSC marker analysis, and in vivo limiting dilution assays. Single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from the blood of PCa patients were analyzed by array comparative genome hybridization. Expression levels of the GLS1 and MYC gene in tumor tissues and amino acid concentrations in blood plasma were correlated to a progression-free survival in PCa patients. Results: Here, we found that radioresistant PCa cells and prostate CSCs have a high glutamine demand. GLS-driven catabolism of glutamine serves not only for energy production but also for the maintenance of the redox state. Consequently, glutamine depletion or inhibition of critical regulators of glutamine utilization, such as GLS and the transcription factor MYC results in PCa radiosensitization. On the contrary, we found that a combination of glutamine metabolism inhibitors with irradiation does not cause toxic effects on nonmalignant prostate cells. Glutamine catabolism contributes to the maintenance of CSCs through regulation of the alpha-ketoglutarate (α-KG)-dependent chromatin-modifying dioxygenase. The lack of glutamine results in the inhibition of CSCs with a high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, decreases the frequency of the CSC populations in vivo and reduces tumor formation in xenograft mouse models. Moreover, this study shows that activation of the ATG5-mediated autophagy in response to a lack of glutamine is a tumor survival strategy to withstand radiation-mediated cell damage. In combination with autophagy inhibition, the blockade of glutamine metabolism might be a promising strategy for PCa radiosensitization. High blood levels of glutamine in PCa patients significantly correlate with a shorter prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time. Furthermore, high expression of critical regulators of glutamine metabolism, GLS1 and MYC, is significantly associated with a decreased progression-free survival in PCa patients treated with radiotherapy. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that GLS-driven glutaminolysis is a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PCa radiosensitization.""","""['Anna Mukha', 'Uğur Kahya', 'Annett Linge', 'Oleg Chen', 'Steffen Löck', 'Vasyl Lukiyanchuk', 'Susan Richter', 'Tiago C Alves', 'Mirko Peitzsch', 'Vladyslav Telychko', 'Sergej Skvortsov', 'Giulia Negro', 'Bertram Aschenbrenner', 'Ira-Ida Skvortsova', 'Peter Mirtschink', 'Fabian Lohaus', 'Tobias Hölscher', 'Hans Neubauer', 'Mahdi Rivandi', 'Vera Labitzky', 'Tobias Lange', 'André Franken', 'Bianca Behrens', 'Nikolas H Stoecklein', 'Marieta Toma', 'Ulrich Sommer', 'Sebastian Zschaeck', 'Maximilian Rehm', 'Graeme Eisenhofer', 'Christian Schwager', 'Amir Abdollahi', 'Christer Groeben', 'Leoni A Kunz-Schughart', 'Gustavo B Baretton', 'Michael Baumann', 'Mechthild Krause', 'Claudia Peitzsch', 'Anna Dubrovska']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Targeting glutamine metabolism and autophagy: the combination for prostate cancer radiosensitization.', 'Interplay between MycN and c-Myc regulates radioresistance and cancer stem cell phenotype in neuroblastoma upon glutamine deprivation.', 'Targeting glutaminase 1 attenuates stemness properties in hepatocellular carcinoma by increasing reactive oxygen species and suppressing Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of Glutaminolysis as a Novel Strategy to Combat Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Targeting GLS1 to cancer therapy through glutamine metabolism.', 'Crosstalk between autophagy and CSCs: molecular mechanisms and translational implications.', 'Stromal cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhance radioresistance of prostate cancer cells via interleukin-8-induced autophagy.', 'Crosstalk between arginine, glutamine, and the branched chain amino acid metabolism in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Small molecule inhibitors for cancer metabolism: promising prospects to be explored.', 'A Five Glutamine-Associated Signature Predicts Prognosis of Prostate Cancer and Links Glutamine Metabolism with Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Over 90% of patients with CRPC exhibit sustained androgen receptor (AR) signaling. KDM4B that removes the repressive mark H3K9me3/2 is a transcriptional activator of AR and has been implicated in the development of CRPC. However, the mechanisms of KDM4B involvement in CRPC remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to demonstrate the molecular pathway mediated by KDM4B in CRPC and to provide proof-of-concept evidence that KDM4B is a potential CRPC target. Methods: CRPC cells (C4-2B or CWR22Rv1) depleted with KDM4B followed by cell proliferation (in vitro and xenograft), microarray, qRT-PCR, Seahorse Flux, and metabolomic analyses were employed to identify the expression and metabolic profiles mediated by KDM4B. Immunoprecipitation was used to determine the KDM4B-c-Myc interaction region. Reporter activity assay and ChIP analysis were used to characterize the KDM4B-c-Myc complex-mediated mechanistic actions. The clinical relevance between KDM4B and c-Myc was determined using UCSC Xena analysis and immunohistochemistry. Results: We showed that KDM4B knockdown impaired CRPC proliferation, switched Warburg to OXPHOS metabolism, and suppressed gene expressions including those targeted by c-Myc. We further demonstrated that KDM4B physically interacted with c-Myc and they were co-recruited to the c-Myc-binding sequence on the promoters of metabolic genes (LDHA, ENO1, and PFK). Importantly, KDM4B and c-Myc synergistically promoted the transactivation of the LDHA promoter in a demethylase-dependent manner. We also provided evidence that KDM4B and c-Myc are co-expressed in PCa tissue and that high expression of both is associated with worse clinical outcome. Conclusions: KDM4B partners with c-Myc and serves as a coactivator of c-Myc to directly enhance c-Myc-mediated metabolism, hence promoting CRPC progression. Targeting KDM4B is thus an alternative therapeutic strategy for advanced prostate cancers driven by c-Myc and AR.""","""['Meng-Jen Wu', 'Chih-Jung Chen', 'Ting-Yu Lin', 'Ying-Yuan Liu', 'Lin-Lu Tseng', 'Mei-Ling Cheng', 'Chih-Pin Chuu', 'Huai-Kuang Tsai', 'Wen-Ling Kuo', 'Hsing-Jien Kung', 'Wen-Ching Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Targeting the KDM4B-AR-c-Myc axis promotes sensitivity to androgen receptor-targeted therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic targeting of histone lysine demethylase KDM4B blocks the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Upregulated KDM4B promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by activating autophagy.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Histone demethylase KDM4B contributes to advanced clear cell renal carcinoma and association with copy number variations and cell cycle progression.', 'Unraveling the Peculiar Features of Mitochondrial Metabolism and Dynamics in Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.', 'Jumonji domain-containing protein RIOX2 is overexpressed and associated with worse survival outcomes in prostate cancers.', 'Molecular Regulation of Androgen Receptors in Major Female Reproductive System Cancers.']"""

RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is an emerging regulatory mechanism for gene expression and its specific roles in PCa progression remains elusive. Methods: Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical analyses were used to detect target gene expression in PCa cells in vitro and prostate tissues from patients. RNA immunoprecipitation was conducted to analyze the specific binding of mRNA to the target protein. Migration and invasion assays were used to assess the migratory capacities of cancer cells. The correlation between target gene expression and survival rate of PCa patients was analyzed based the TCGA database. Results: We found that total RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification levels were markedly upregulated in human PCa tissues due to increased expression of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3). Further studies revealed that the migratory and invasive capacities of PCa cells were markedly suppressed upon METTL3 knockdown. Mechanistically, METTL3 mediates m6A modification of USP4 mRNA at A2696, and m6A reader protein YTHDF2 binds to and induces degradation of USP4 mRNA by recruiting RNA-binding protein HNRNPD to the mRNA. Decrease of USP4 fails to remove the ubiquitin group from ELAVL1 protein, resulting in a reduction of ELAVL1 protein. Lastly, downregulation of ELAVL1 in turn increases ARHGDIA expression, promoting migration and invasion of PCa cells. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the role of METTL3 in modulating invasion and metastasis of PCa cells, providing insight into promising therapeutic strategies for hindering PCa progressing to deadly metastases.""","""['Yabing Chen', 'Chun Pan', 'Xiaotong Wang', 'Dihui Xu', 'Yuhan Ma', 'Jianhang Hu', 'Peilin Chen', 'Zou Xiang', 'Qiu Rao', 'Xiaodong Han']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['YTHDF2 mediates the mRNA degradation of the tumor suppressors to induce AKT phosphorylation in N6-methyladenosine-dependent way in prostate cancer.', 'METTL3 facilitates tumor progression via an m6A-IGF2BP2-dependent mechanism in colorectal carcinoma.', 'METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification is critical for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of gastric cancer.', 'Multifaceted Roles of the N6-Methyladenosine RNA Methyltransferase METTL3 in Cancer and Immune Microenvironment.', 'The Emerging Roles of RNA m6A Methylation and Demethylation as Critical Regulators of Tumorigenesis, Drug Sensitivity, and Resistance.', 'Methyltransferase-like proteins in cancer biology and potential therapeutic targeting.', 'The emerging roles and mechanism of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in urologic tumours progression.', 'Activation of the HNRNPA2B1/miR-93-5p/FRMD6 axis facilitates prostate cancer progression in an m6A-dependent manner.', 'M6A-modified circRBM33 promotes prostate cancer progression via PDHA1-mediated mitochondrial respiration regulation and presents a potential target for ARSI therapy.', 'The m6A methylation landscape, molecular characterization and clinical relevance in prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""

Methods:   Data were collected from 14 population-based cancer registries across Zhejiang Province of China. Cancer incidence and mortality rates stratified by sex and region were analyzed. The crude rate, age-standardized rate, age-specific and region-specific rate, and cumulative rate were calculated. The proportions of 10 common cancers in different groups and the incidence and mortality rates of the top five cancers in different age groups were also calculated. The Chinese national census of 2000 and the world Segi population was used for calculating the age-standardized incidence and mortality rates.  Results:   The 14 cancer registries covered a population of 14,250,844 individuals, accounting for 29.13% of the population of Zhejiang Province. The total reported cancer cases and deaths were 55,835 and 27,013, respectively. The proportion of morphological verification (MV%) was 78.95% of the population, and percentage of incident cases identified through death certificates only (DCO%) was 1.23% with a mortality-to-incidence ratio (M/I ratio) of 0.48.

Objective:   To test whether downgrading could be predicted accurately.  Design, setting, and participants:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database (2010-2016), 6690 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk PCa patients were identified.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   We randomly split the overall cohort between development and validation cohorts (both n = 3345, 50%). Multivariable logistic regression models used biopsy Gleason, prostate-specific antigen, number of positive prostate biopsy cores, and cT stage to predict downgrading. Accuracy, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA) tested the model in the external validation cohort.  Results and limitations:   Of 6690 patients, 50.3% were downgraded at RP, and of 2315 patients with any biopsy pattern 5, 44.1% were downgraded to RP Gleason pattern ≤4 + 4. Downgrading rates were highest in biopsy Gleason pattern 5 + 5 (84.1%) and lowest in 3 + 4 (4.0%). In the validation cohort, the logistic regression model-derived nomogram predicted downgrading with 71.0% accuracy, with marginal departures (±3.3%) from ideal predictions in calibration. In DCA, a net benefit throughout all threshold probabilities was recorded, relative to treat-all or treat-none strategies and an algorithm based on an average downgrading rate of 50.3%. All steps were repeated in the subgroup with any biopsy Gleason pattern 5, to predict RP Gleason pattern ≤4 + 4. Here, a second nomogram (n = 2315) yielded 68.0% accuracy, maximal departures from ideal prediction of ±5.7%, and virtually the same DCA pattern as the main nomogram.  Conclusions:   Downgrading affects half of all high-risk PCa patients. Its presence may be predicted accurately and may help with better treatment planning.  Patient summary:   Downgrading occurs in every second high-risk prostate cancer patients.

Tolerability may limit use in clinical practice.  Background:   Enzalutamide is an established standard-of-care treatment for advanced prostate cancer with a commercially available formulation that may be inconvenient for some patients. We proposed a study to evaluate the bioequivalence of a liquid formulation to provide an alternative method of administration.  Methods:   This was a single-dose, randomized, open-label, two-way crossover pilot bioequivalence study to compare two oral formulations of enzalutamide: four enzalutamide 40 mg liquid-filled soft-gelatin capsules (commercially available) administered whole versus enzalutamide 160 mg liquid (extracted from capsules) administered via oral syringe. To assess bioequivalence, patients were randomized to receive a single dose of one formulation, then cross over to receive the alternative formulation following a 42-day washout period; serial plasma samples were collected over the course of 24 hours, followed by collections at 3, 8, and 42 days after the dose for both formulations. Bioequivalence of the formulations was assessed via comparisons of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) calculations per U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance. The study also assessed the safety and tolerability of the formulations.  Results:   The study failed to meet proposed accrual, with only one patient enrolled, thus limiting the bioequivalence evaluation. Based on the data from a single patient, the drug exposure (measured by AUC) of enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide (primary active metabolite) for the liquid formulation was 112% and 117%, respectively, compared with the capsule formulation. Although both formulations appeared well tolerated with no adverse events reported, the tolerability assessment questionnaire revealed an unpleasant taste of the liquid formulation.  Conclusion:   Preliminary evidence suggests a similar pharmacokinetic profile when administering liquid extracted from enzalutamide soft-gelatin capsules compared with intact capsules in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Lisa M Cordes', 'Keith T Schmidt', 'Cody J Peer', 'Cindy H Chau', 'Erica Redmond', 'Deneise Francis', 'Fatima Karzai', 'Ravi A Madan', 'William D Figg']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Relative bioavailability of levodropropizine 60 mg capsule and syrup formulations in healthy male Korean volunteers: a singledose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-way crossover study.', 'The relative bioavailability and fasting pharmacokinetics of three formulations of olmesartan medoxomil 20-mg capsules and tablets in healthy Chinese male volunteers: An open-label, randomized-sequence, single-dose, three-way crossover study.', 'Results of a single-center, single-dose, randomized-sequence, open-label, two-way crossover bioequivalence study of two formulations of valsartan 160-mg tablets in healthy volunteers under fasting conditions.', 'Bioavailability of omeprazole 20 mg capsules containing omeprazole 22.5% enteric coated pellets versus a reference product in healthy Bangladeshi male subjects: an open-label, single-dose, randomized-sequence, two-way crossover study.', 'Effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of oxycodone and naltrexone from ALO-02, an extended release formulation of oxycodone with sequestered naltrexone.']"""

Methods:   All CV admissions from the US National Inpatient Sample between October 2015 to December 2017 were stratified by cancer type as well as metastatic status. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) of in-hospital mortality in different groups.  Results:   From 5,936,014 eligible CV admissions, cancer was present in 265,221 (4.5%) hospitalizations. There was significant variation in the admission diagnoses among the different cancers, with hematological malignancies being principally associated with heart failure (HF), lung cancer with atrial fibrillation (AF), and colorectal and prostate cancer with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Admission with haemorrhagic stroke has the highest associated mortality across cancers (20.0-38.4%). In-hospital mortality was higher in cancer than non-cancer patients across most CV admissions (P < 0.001) with AF having the worst prognosis. Compared to group without any cancer, the greatest aOR of mortality was associated with lung cancer in AMI (aOR 2.32, 95% CI 2.18-2.47), ischemic stroke (aOR 2.21, 95%CI 2.08-2.34), AF (aOR 4.69, 95%CI 4.32-5.10) and HF (aOR 2.07, 95%CI 1.89-2.27).  Conclusions:   The most common causes of CV admission to hospital vary in patients with different types of cancer, with AMI being most common in patients with colon cancer, HF in patients with hematological malignancies and AF in patients with lung cancer.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Baseline demographics of the entire cohort were stratified based on their reported disabilities (none, disabled, deaf, and blind). Each disability was compared separately and in combination with the cohort without disabilities. Multivariable logistic regression models determined clinically significant predictors of PSA testing in men with disabilities compared with those without.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 782 (15%) men with disabilities were compared with 4569 (85%) men without disabilities. The former cohort was older with a median (interquartile range) age of 65 (56-75) versus 57 (43-67) yr (p < 0.001).

Objective:   To assess a novel technique of IFS targeted to the index lesion by using augmented reality three-dimensional (AR-3D) models in patients scheduled for nerve-sparing RARP (NS-RARP).  Design, setting, and participants:   Between March 2019 and July 2019, 20 consecutive prostate cancer patients underwent NS-RARP with IFS directed to the index lesion with the help of AR-3D models (study group). Control group consists of 20 patients matched with 1:1 propensity score for age, clinical stage, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score v2, International Society of Urological Pathology grade, prostate volume, NS approach, and prostate-specific antigen in which RARP was performed by cognitive assessment of mpMRI.  Surgical procedure:   In the study group, an AR-3D model was superimposed to the surgical field to guide the surgical dissection. Tissue sampling for IFS was taken in the area in which the index lesion was projected by AR-3D guidance.  Measurements:   Chi-square test, Student t test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare, respectively, proportions, means, and medians between the two groups.  Results and limitations:   Patients in the AR-3D group had comparable preoperative characteristics and those undergoing the NS approach were referred to as the control group (all p ≥ 0.06).

However, due to the excessive heating generated by laser irradiation, there is a possibility of damage to the adjacent healthy tissues. This paper through in silico study presents a novel approach to reduce collateral effects due to heating by the placement of polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer between the rectum and tumor during laser irradiation. The PEG spacer thickness is optimized to reduce the undesired damage at common laser power used in the clinical trials. Our study also encompasses novelty by conducting the thermal analysis based on the porous structure of prostate tumor.  Methods:   The thermal parameters and two thermal phase lags between the temperature gradient and the heat flux, are determined by considering the vascular network of prostate tumor. The Nelder-Mead algorithm is applied to find the minimum thickness of the PEG spacer.  Results:   In the absence of the spacer, the predicted results for the laser power of 4 W, 8 W, and 12 W show that the temperature of the rectum rises up to 58.6 °C, 80.4 °C, and 101.1 °C, while through the insertion of 2.59 mm, 4 mm, and 4.9 mm of the PEG spacer, it dramatically reduces below 42 °C.

These differences may translate into differences in treatment type.  Methods:   We tested for differences in PCa tumor characteristics and differences in active treatment rates (radical prostatectomy [RP], external beam radiotherapy [EBRT]) according to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry (2010-2015) in favorable and unfavorable IR PCa. Data were stratified according to individual SEER registries. Further analyses additionally adjusted for PCa baseline characteristics (PSA, cT stage, biopsy Gleason group grading [GGG], percentage of positive biopsy cores).  Results:   Tabulations according to SEER registries showed that, in favorable IR vs. unfavorable IR, the rates of RP and EBRT respectively ranged from 30.0 to 54.3% vs. 30.3-55.5 % and 8.3-44.7 % vs. 11.5-45.5 %. Differences in age and baseline PCa tumor characteristics also existed in both favorable and unfavorable IR across SEER registries.

To achieve intracellular homeostasis, proteins that are misfolded as a result of translational errors or genetic mutations must be eliminated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In our previous publications, we determined that 4T1 breast and B16F10 melanoma cancer cells have differential levels of resistance to proteasome inhibitors. Again, in the previous studies, we reported that 4T1 cell cultures, despite being p53-mutant, underwent apoptosis as a result of bortezomib treatment. The first goal of this study was to verify the resistance levels of parental and resistant PC3 prostate cancer cells to bortezomib using WST-1 test. As a result of treatment with different bortezomib concentrations for 48 h, the IC50 value of the parental cells was determined as 32.8 nM and that of the resistant cells was determined as 346 nM. This result showed that the resistant cells were at least 10.5 times more resistant. In addition, to determine whether the resistance gained was reversible or not, the cells were passaged in a medium without bortezomib for one month. The IC50 value determination by WST-1 test showed that the resistant PC3 cells gained an irreversible bortezomib resistance phenotype. The results of the 3D spheroid experiment showed that the 3D spheroid diameter of resistant cells was significantly higher than that of the parental cells. The studies conducted with Western blot showed that ERK1 MAPK T202 phosphorylation and the conversion of autophagy marker LC3-I to LC3-II were significantly increased in parental cells as compared to the resistant cells. Finally, the results showed that while both maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) inhibitor OTSSP167 and Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (also an inhibitor of the expression of antiapoptotic protein GRP78) are promising agents for cancer cells resistant to the proteasome inhibitors, CDK2 inhibitor CVT-313 was found ineffective in both parental and the resistant cells.""","""['Ertan Kanbur', 'Ahmet Tarık Baykal', 'Azmi Yerlikaya']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Oncol""","""['A novel and effective inhibitor combination involving bortezomib and OTSSP167 for breast cancer cells in light of label-free proteomic analysis.', 'C/EBPβ regulates sensitivity to bortezomib in prostate cancer cells by inducing REDD1 and autophagosome-lysosome fusion.', 'PSMA5 promotes the tumorigenic process of prostate cancer and is related to bortezomib resistance.', 'A novel combination treatment for breast cancer cells involving BAPTA-AM and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.', 'The p53-independent induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cells in response to proteasome inhibitor bortezomib.', ""Let's Go 3D!

We investigated the anticancer potential of abundant monophenols from cinnamon, namely, cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, and eugenol, by hypothesizing that they possess proteasome inhibitory activities capable of suppressing cancer cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. This hypothesis was tested by evaluating proteasome inhibitory activities of the compounds, and assessing downstream molecular and cellular events that are known to be impacted by proteasome inhibitors. The cinnamon compounds inhibited the catalytic activities of the proteasome in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal cells. Treatment with cinnamon compounds or the synthetic proteasome inhibitor MG132 upregulated p27 and IkBα proteins, and downregulated FoxM1 and angiogenic markers. These molecular events were associated with the decreased proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Treatment with cinnamon compounds or MG132 upregulated the expression of genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (BIP, PERK, CHOP, and XBP1(S)). Furthermore, cinnamon compounds or MG132 upregulated the expression of genes required for the assembly of the caspase-8 activation platform in autophagosomes (LC3B, ATG5, p62, and Beclin1). The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, blocked the compounds-mediated activation of caspase-8 and its downstream target caspase-3.

Hence, we evaluated CIRT for PC with bladder invasion in terms of the safety and efficacy.  Methods:   Between March 2010 and December 2016, a total of 1337 patients with nonmetastatic PC received CIRT at a total dose of 57.6 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Among them, seven patients who had locally advanced PC with bladder invasion were identified. Long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) was also administered to these patients. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version 5.0.  Results:   At the completion of our study, all the patients with cT4 PC were alive with a median follow-up period of 78 months. Grade 2 acute urinary disorders were observed in only one patient. Regarding late toxicities, only one patient developed grade 2 hematuria and urinary urgency. There was no grade 3 or worse toxicity, and gastrointestinal toxicity was not observed. Six (85.7%) patients had no recurrence or metastasis. One patient had biochemical and local failures 42 and 45 months after CIRT, respectively. However, the recurrent disease has been well controlled by salvage ADT.  Conclusions:   Seven patients with locally advanced PC invading the bladder treated with CIRT were evaluated. Our findings seem to suggest positive safety and efficacy profiles for CIRT.""","""['Yuhei Miyasaka', 'Hidemasa Kawamura', 'Hiro Sato', 'Nobuteru Kubo', 'Tatsuji Mizukami', 'Hiroshi Matsui', 'Yoshiyuki Miyazawa', 'Kazuto Ito', 'Takashi Nakano', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki', 'Tatsuya Ohno']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Phase I/II trial of definitive carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer: evaluation of shortening of treatment period to 3 weeks.', 'Significant impact of biochemical recurrence on overall mortality in patients with high-risk prostate cancer after carbon-ion radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Preliminary result of carbon-ion radiotherapy using the spot scanning method for prostate cancer.', 'Salvage reirradiation for locoregional failure after radiation therapy for prostate cancer: who, when, where and how?', 'Repeated Carbon-Ion Radiation Therapy for Intrahepatic Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   The number and temporal fluctuations of circulating tumor cells (CTC), cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) and CTC cluster present in each blood sample was determined.  Results:   The results show that both CTC and CTC cluster levels significantly increased immediately following primary tumor resection, but returned to baseline within 2 weeks post-surgery. In contrast, the CAF level decreased over time. In patients who experienced PC recurrence within months after resection, CTC, CAF, and cluster levels all increased over time. Based on this observation, we tested the efficacy of an experimental TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-based liposomal therapy ex-vivo to induce apoptosis in CTC in blood. The TRAIL-based therapy killed approximately 75% of single CTCs and CTC in cluster form.  Conclusion:   Collectively, these data indicate that CTC cluster and CAF levels can be used as a predictive biomarker for cancer recurrence. Moreover, for the first time, we demonstrate the efficacy of our TRAIL-based liposomal therapy to target and kill prostate CTC in primary patient blood samples, suggesting a potential new adjuvant therapy to use in combination with surgery.""","""['Nerymar Ortiz-Otero', 'Jocelyn R Marshall', 'Antonio Glenn', 'Jubin Matloubieh', 'Jean Joseph', 'Deepak M Sahasrabudhe', 'Edward M Messing', 'Michael R King']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Chemotherapy-induced release of circulating-tumor cells into the bloodstream in collective migration units with cancer-associated fibroblasts in metastatic cancer patients.', 'TRAIL-coated leukocytes that prevent the bloodborne metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'Detection of Circulating Tumor Cells in Locally Advanced High-risk Prostate Cancer During Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Circulating tumor cells as a marker of response: implications for determining treatment efficacy and evaluating new agents.', 'Regulation of prostate cancer progression by the tumor microenvironment.', 'Instructional materials that control cellular activity through synthetic Notch receptors.', 'Recent Advances in the Development of Nanodelivery Systems Targeting the TRAIL Death Receptor Pathway.', 'A narrative review of circulating tumor cells clusters: A key morphology of cancer cells in circulation promote hematogenous metastasis.', 'Insights into Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters: A Barometer for Treatment Effects and Prognosis for Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Such markers include the copy number variation as well as gene and microRNA expression.  Purpose:   The aim of the study was to validate the list of potential predictors of radioresistance of prostate tumor cells in a model experiment based on the determination of gene copy number variation, gene transcriptional activity and microRNA expression.  Material and methods:   The study used a PC-3 prostate cancer cell culture. The determination of the relative copy number variation and expression of 32 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, CASP3, CASP8, BAX, BCL2, CASP9, P53, MDM2, AKT1, ATM, BRIP1, CDK1, CDKN1B, CCND1, CCND3, FGFR2, KU70, RAD50, RAP80, Rif1, RNF168, TopBP1, HIST, H2AX, EXO1, XRCC4, RBBP8, EP300, LIG4, C-FLIP), as well as 15 microRNAs (let-7, miR15a/&#8202;16, miR-17, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-24, miR-26b, miR-99a, miR-100, miR-101, miR-106a, miR-663a, miR-143, miR-145) was performed using the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. It was found that daily irradiation of PC-3 cells on a Novalis TX linear accelerator at doses of 6 and 7 Gy for 5 days leads to a significant decrease in the total number of cells and the number of viable cells. Nevertheless, after 5 days of irradiation, about 15% of the initial number of prostate tumor cells retained their viability, which is due to their special genetic and epigenetic characteristics: increased copy number and expression of genes BRCA2, CDK1, CDKN1B, H2AX, RAD50, XRCC4, RBBP8 and EP300 and reduced copy number and expression of CCND3, TP53, and BCL2 genes, as well as differential expression of six microRNAs (hsa-miR-18a-5p, hsa-miR-24-5p, hsa-miR-99a-5p, hsa-miR-100-5p, hsa-miR-145-5p, hsa-let-7a-3p).

At least 40 germacrane-type sesquiterpene lactones, representatives of four different structural groups, were isolated from the plant. Cytotoxicity against cancer cells in vitro is the most frequently described biological activity of the compounds. However, little is known about the selectivity of the cytotoxic effect. The anti-inflammatory activity of the germacranolides is also poorly documented. The objective of the present study was to assess the cytotoxic activity of selected C. divaricatum germacranolides-derivatives of 4,5,8,9-tetrahydroxy-3-oxo-germacran-6,12-olide towards cancer and normal cell lines (including cells of different p53 status). Moreover, to assess the anti-inflammatory effect of the compounds, the release of four proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines (IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and CCL2) by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human neutrophils was measured by ELISA. The investigated sesquiterpene lactones demonstrated nonselective activity towards prostate cancer (Du145 and PC3) and normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) as well as against melanoma cells (A375 and HTB140) and keratinocytes (HaCaT). Cytotoxic activity against osteosarcoma cells was independent of their p53 status.

Herein, we characterized the epithelial cell lineage hierarchy in prostaspheres using single-cell RNA-seq analysis. Keratin profiling revealed three clusters of label-retaining prostate stem cells; cluster I represents quiescent stem cells (PSCA, CD36, SPINK1, and KRT13/23/80/78/4 enriched), while clusters II and III represent active stem and bipotent progenitor cells (KRT16/17/6 enriched). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed enrichment of stem and cancer-related pathways in cluster I. In non-label-retaining daughter progenitor cells, three clusters were identified; cluster IV represents basal progenitors (KRT5/14/6/16 enriched), while clusters V and VI represent early and late-stage luminal progenitors, respectively (KRT8/18/10 enriched). Furthermore, MetaCore analysis showed enrichment of the ""cytoskeleton remodeling-keratin filaments"" pathway in cancer stem-like cells from human prostate cancer specimens. Along with common keratins (KRT13/23/80/78/4) in normal stem cells, unique keratins (KRT10/19/6C/16) were enriched in cancer stem-like cells.

A large number of works prove the anticarcinogenic effect of SeNP. In this work, the molecular mechanisms regulating the cytotoxic effects of SeNP, obtained by laser ablation, were studied by the example of four human cancer cell lines: A-172 (glioblastoma), Caco-2, (colorectal adenocarcinoma), DU-145 (prostate carcinoma), MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma). It was found that SeNP had different concentration-dependent effects on cancer cells of the four studied human lines. SeNP at concentrations of less than 1 μg/mL had no cytotoxic effect on the studied cancer cells, with the exception of the A-172 cell line, for which 0.5 μg/mL SeNP was the minimum concentration affecting its metabolic activity. It was shown that SeNP concentration-dependently caused cancer cell apoptosis, but not necrosis. In addition, it was found that SeNP enhanced the expression of pro-apoptotic genes in almost all cancer cell lines, with the exception of Caco-2 and activated various pathways of adaptive and pro-apoptotic signaling pathways of UPR. Different effects of SeNP on the expression of ER-resident selenoproteins and selenium-containing glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, depending on the cell line, were established. In addition, SeNP triggered Ca2+ signals in all investigated cancer cell lines. Different sensitivity of cancer cell lines to SeNP can determine the induction of the process of apoptosis in them through regulation of the Ca2+ signaling system, mechanisms of ER stress, and activation of various expression patterns of genes encoding pro-apoptotic proteins.""","""['Elena G Varlamova', 'Mikhail V Goltyaev', ""Valentina N Mal'tseva"", 'Egor A Turovsky', 'Ruslan M Sarimov', 'Alexander V Simakin', 'Sergey V Gudkov']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Expression of ER-resident selenoproteins and activation of cancer cells apoptosis mechanisms under ER-stress conditions caused by methylseleninic acid.', 'Selenium nanoparticles as a carrier of 5-fluorouracil to achieve anticancer synergism.', 'Mechanism of Ca2+-Dependent Pro-Apoptotic Action of Selenium Nanoparticles, Mediated by Activation of Cx43 Hemichannels.', 'Selenium metabolism, selenoproteins and mechanisms of cancer prevention: complexities with thioredoxin reductase.', 'Chemopreventive mechanism of action by oxidative stress and toxicity induced surface decorated selenium nanoparticles.', 'MicroRNA-nanoparticles against cancer: Opportunities and challenges for personalized medicine.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of the Cytotoxic Effect of Recombinant Selenoprotein SELENOM on Human Glioblastoma Cells.', 'Inorganic Nanomaterials Used in Anti-Cancer Therapies:Further Developments.', 'Biogenic Selenium Nanoparticles in Biomedical Sciences: Properties, Current Trends, Novel Opportunities and Emerging Challenges in Theranostic Nanomedicine.', 'Ca2+-Dependent Effects of the Selenium-Sorafenib Nanocomplex on Glioblastoma Cells and Astrocytes of the Cerebral Cortex: Anticancer Agent and Cytoprotector.']"""

We aimed to understand and analyze the care pathways for BCa and PCa patients followed at a hospital setting by analyzing their different treatment lines. We evaluated the association between different treatment lines and the lifestyle and demographic characteristics of these patients. Two datasets were created using the electronic health records (EHRs) and information collected through semi-structured one-on-one interviews. Statistical analysis was performed to examine which variable had an impact on the treatment each patient followed. In total, 83 patients participated in the study that ran between January and November 2018 in Beacon Hospital. Results show that chemotherapy cycles indicate if a patient would have other treatments, i.e., patients who have targeted therapy (25/46) have more chemotherapy cycles (95% CI 4.66-9.52, p = 0.012), the same is observed with endocrine therapy (95% CI 4.77-13.59, p = 0.044).

The data of 20 patients who received hydrogel spacer implantation for prostate SBRT were retrospectively analyzed. The prescription dose was 36.25 Gy in five fractions to 95% of the planning target volume (PTV; D95). The conformity index (CI), gradient index (GI), homogeneity index (HI), and dose-volume histogram (DVH) were analyzed for the three modalities, using the same PTV margins.

Elucidating the relationship between OPFRs and tumors holds great significance for the treatment and prevention of diseases. In this work, we found a new method for predicting the correlation between the interactive genes of OPFRs and tumors. Transcriptome profiles and OPFR information were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression, Comparative Toxicogenomics, and PharmMapper databases. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that interactive genes were mainly enriched in prostate cancer, steroid metabolic process, and steroid hormone regulation. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed 33 biological hub genes. The operating characteristic curves and survival analysis showed the role of key genes in predicting the prognosis of prostate cancer. Gene target prediction and gene set variation analysis proved that OPFRs and their metabolites exert potential effects on prostate cancer. Colony formation assay showed that the cells with AR, mTOR and DDIT3 knockdown could remarkably mitigate the cell proliferation ability in both PC-3 and LNCap cells. Transwell assay demonstrated that the silencing of AR, mTOR and DDIT3 could significantly inhibit the cell invasion capacity of prostate cells.

The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of their concurrent administration in the first-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   In this open-label, randomised, phase II trial, previously untreated mCRPC patients were randomised 1:1 to receive eight 21-d courses of docetaxel 75 mg/m2, oral prednisone 5 mg twice daily and oral enzalutamide 160 mg/d (arm DE), or the same treatment without enzalutamide (arm D). The primary end-point was the percentage of patients without investigator-assessed disease progression 6 months after the first docetaxel administration.  Results:   The 246 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive docetaxel, prednisone and enzalutamide (n = 120) or docetaxel and prednisone (n = 126). The 6-month progression rate was 12.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.1-20.6) in arm DE and 27.8% (95% CI 22.8-39.4) in arm D (chi-squared test 10.01; P = 0.002).

Conclusions:   The combination of enzalutamide and docetaxel appears to be more clinically beneficial than docetaxel alone in previously untreated mCRPC patients, although serious adverse events were more frequent. Our findings suggest that first-line treatment with this combination could lead to an additional clinical benefit when prompt and prolonged disease control is simultaneously required.

Methods:   From a prospective database of patients undergoing RP after a combination of SB (median 12 cores) and fusion TB (median 3 cores), we included 150 PI-RADS 3 cases. Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined by a Grade Group 2 or more. The primary endpoints were unfavourable features in RP specimens.  Results:   Targeted biopsy was negative in 20.7% of patients. Final Grade Group 3 or more and a pT3 stage was reported in 36.7% and 38.7% of RP specimens. The upgrading rate was 38.2% between biopsy and RP specimens. The concordance rate between Grade Group on TB and RP was only 38.0%. The two independent predictive factors for unfavourable disease (pT3-4 and/or final Grade Group 3-5) were prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD; P = 0.001) and presence of csPCa on TB (odds ratio 3.7; P = 0.001). The risk of unfavourable disease was increased 2.3-fold and 5.8-fold, respectively, for patients with a PSAD between 0.15 and 0.20, and a PSAD >0.20 ng/mL/g. The 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was 93.2%.  Conclusions:   PI-RADS 3 lesions exhibited aggressive features in almost 40% of cases.

Secondary outcomes included a comparison of transrectal MRI-directed biopsy (TR-MRDB) and transperineal (TP)-MRDB in men with suspicious MRI.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively assessed a two-centre cohort of consecutive biopsy-naïve men with suspicion of prostate cancer who underwent a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) compliant pre-biopsy MRI in a single, high-volume centre between 2015 and 2019 (Centre 1). Men with suspicious MRI scans underwent TR-MRDB in Centre 1 and TP-MRDB with additional random biopsies (RB) in Centre 2. The MRI and histopathology were assessed in the same institution (Centre 1). Outcomes included: (i) overall detection rates of Grade Group (GG) 1, GG ≥2, and GG ≥3 cancer in men with suspicious MRI; (ii) Biopsy-avoidance due to non-suspicious MRI; and (iii) Cancer detection rates and biopsy-related complications between TR- and TP-MRDB. To reduce confounding bias for MRDB comparisons, inverse probability weighting (IPW) was performed for age, digital rectal examination, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostate volume, PSA density, and PI-RADS category.  Results:   Of the 2597 men included, the overall GG 1, GG ≥2, and GG ≥3 prevalence was 8% (210/2597), 27% (697/2597), and 15% (396/2597), respectively. Biopsy was avoided in 57% (1488/2597) of men. After IPW, the GG 1, GG ≥2 and GG ≥3 detection rates after TR- and TP-MRDB were comparable at 24%, 57%, and 32%; and 18%, 64%, and 38%, respectively; with mean differences of -5.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] -13% to 1.4%), 6.1% (95% CI -2.1% to 14%), and 5.7% (95% CI -1.7% to 13%). Complications were similar in TR-MRDB (0.50%) and TP-MRDB with RB (0.62%; mean difference 0.11%, 95% CI -0.87% to 1.1%).  Conclusion:   This high-volume, two-centre study shows pre-biopsy MRI as a decision tool is implementable in daily clinical practice.

The objective of this study was to assess longitudinally the prevalence and predictors of FCR in long-term prostate cancer (PCa) survivors.  Methods:   In all, 2417 survivors from the multicenter German Familial Prostate Cancer Database completed the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form on average 7 years (T1 in 2010) after radical prostatectomy and at follow-up 9 years later (T2 in 2019). Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was used to assess predictors of FCR at follow-up.  Results:   The mean age at the initial assessment was 69.5 years (standard deviation, 5.9 years); 6.5% and 8.4% of patients reported clinical FCR at the initial assessment (T1) and at the follow-up (T2), respectively. In a multivariable analysis controlling for concurrent associations, longitudinal predictors of FCR 9 years later included a lower level of education (odds ratio [OR], 4.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33-8.33), years since radical prostatectomy (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.18), biochemical recurrence (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.02-2.72), no current adjuvant therapy (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.19-4.76), FCR (OR, 10.75; 95% CI, 6.18-18.72), and anxiety (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.06-1.72).

Immunotherapy involving Sipuleucel-T has increasingly drawn attention for prostate cancer management. BCG plays a vital role in treating bladder cancer, mainly by inducing immune activation, but is rarely used for prostate cancer. (2) Methods: The TCGA database, PCR, and Western blotting were used to analyze the expression of STEAP1 in mouse and human tissues. Then, we constructed a fusion protein vaccine with Mycobacterium tuberculosis Ag85B and three repeated octapeptide epitopes of a six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1186-193), Ag85B-3×STEAP1186-193. The uptake of the fusion protein vaccine by DCs was evaluated by confocal microscopy, and DC markers were detected using flow cytometry after incubation with the fusion protein. The immune response against prostate cancer was evaluated by the LDH assay and xenografts in vitro and in vivo. Then, the tumor microenvironment was determined using IHC and ELISA. In addition, the epitope was mutated using CRISPR-Cas9 to illustrate that the fusion protein elicited immunization against STEAP1. (3) Results: The TCGA database analysis, PCR, and Western blotting showed that STEAP1 was highly expressed in human and murine prostate cancer. After the uptake of the purified fusion protein vaccine by DCs, CD11c, CD80, CD86, and MHC II were upregulated and triggered a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against TRAMP-C1 and RM1 cells in vitro. Furthermore, the fusion protein vaccine inhibited tumor growth and improved the tumor microenvironment in vivo, with more CD3+ cells and fewer FOXP3+ cells in the tumor. Serum IFN-γ and IL-2 were significantly higher than in the control group, while IL-4 expression was lower, indicating that the fusion protein vaccine activated Th1 immunity. The immune response against prostate cancer was greatly suppressed when the antigen targets were knocked out using CRISPR-Cas9. (4) Conclusion: In summary, our results provide the first evidence that a vaccine based on a fusion protein consisting of Ag85B and a prostate cancer octapeptide epitope with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), triggers a robust immune response and inhibits tumor growth in murine prostate cancer.""","""['Linpei Guo', 'Hui Xie', 'Zheng Zhang', 'Zhun Wang', 'Shuanghe Peng', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Zhiqun Shang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Vaccines (Basel)""","""['STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Recombinant Bacille Calmette-Guérin coexpressing Ag85B-IFN-γ enhances the cell-mediated immunity in C57BL/6 mice.', 'Inhibition of mouse RM-1 prostate cancer and B16F10 melanoma by the fusion protein of HSP65 & STEAP1 186-193.', 'Prokaryotic expression and immunological characteristics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv1886c.', 'Novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis.', 'The immunogenicity of an extended dosing interval of BNT162b2 against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant among healthy school-aged children, a randomized controlled trial.', 'EFEMP1 binds to STEAP1 to promote osteosarcoma proliferation and invasion via the Wnt/β-catenin and TGF-β/Smad2/3 signal pathways.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.']"""

The immunohistochemical expression of proliferative cell nuclear antigen was also measured to correlate the quantitative changes estimated with the proliferative activity of the epithelium. The average cell volume in normal and tumor epithelium was estimated using the method of the nucleator. The relative size of the acini was similar in the carcinoma compared with the normal prostate. Within the acini, the fraction of acinar volume occupied by the epithelium was significantly higher in cancer than in the nontumor prostate. Conversely, the glandular lumen of the cancer acini is lower than in the normal acini. The significant increase of acinar length density in the carcinoma indicates that the glandular tree's growth in the carcinoma is higher and with more branches than in the case of nonneoplastic glands. The basal surface density is higher in the carcinoma than in the controls. The number of epithelial cells per unit length of acini was significantly decreased in the neoplastic glands.

AKR1C3-dependent cytotoxicity of 3424 was determined in a wide range of human cancer cell lines with different AKR1C3 expression levels. In addition, anti-tumor activity of 3424 was also investigated in a broad panel of CDX and PDX models. AKR1C3-dependent activation of prodrug 3424 was evident by monitoring the decrease of 3424 and generation of the active form, 2660. Kinetic analysis indicated that AKR1C3 exhibited higher catalytic efficiency towards 3424 compared to the physiological substrates. There was a strong correlation between 3424 cytotoxic potency and AKR1C3 expression. The racemic mixture induced DNA cross-linking in a concentration dependent manner. Tumor growth inhibition of 3424 was shown to be better than or comparable to the standard of care chemotherapy at clinically achievable doses as a single agent in various CDX models with high expression of AKR1C3, including liver HepG2, lung H460, castration-resistant prostate VCaP, gastric SNU-16, and kidney A498 cancer cell lines. The excellent anti-tumor efficacy of 3424 was further demonstrated in PDX models which have high level of AKR1C3 expression, but not in a model with low level of AKR1C3 expression. In the combination therapy, we showed that 3424 could enhance the efficacy of the standard care of chemotherapy in the CDX models. The results described here highlight that 3424 exhibits AKR1C3-dependent cytotoxicity in vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo in a wide range of human cancer types, which support further development of 3424 as an anti-cancer agent for treating different types of cancers and the use of AKR1C3 as a biomarker to profile cancer patients and further guide patient selection for therapy with 3424.""","""['Fanying Meng', 'Wan-Fen Li', 'Donald Jung', 'Chun-Chung Wang', 'Tianyang Qi', 'Chi-Sheng Shia', 'Ren-Yu Hsu', 'Yin-Cheng Hsieh', 'Jianxin Duan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['OBI-3424, a Novel AKR1C3-Activated Prodrug, Exhibits Potent Efficacy against Preclinical Models of T-ALL.', 'An AKR1C3-specific prodrug with potent anti-tumor activities against T-ALL.', 'A Novel AKR1C3 Specific Prodrug TH3424 With Potent Antitumor Activity in Liver Cancer.', 'Activation of oxazaphosphorines by cytochrome P450: application to gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy for cancer.', 'AKR1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/prostaglandin F synthase): Roles in malignancy and endocrine disorders.', 'Phase 1 dose-escalation study evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, and clinical activity of OBI-3424 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.']"""

Unlike conventional anticancer drugs, D-All targets glucose metabolism and is non-toxic to normal cells. Therefore, it has attracted attention as a unique ""seed"" compound for anticancer agents. However, the anti-proliferative activities of the other rare aldohexoses have not been examined yet. In this study, we evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of rare aldohexoses against human leukemia MOLT-4F and human prostate cancer DU-145 cell lines. We found that D-All and D-idose (D-Ido) at 5 mM inhibited cell proliferation of MOLT-4F cells by 46 % and 60 %, respectively. On the other hand, the rare aldohexoses at 5 mM did not show specific anti-proliferative activity against DU-145 cells. To explore the structure-activity relationship of D-Ido, we evaluated the anti-proliferative activity of D-sorbose (D-Sor), 6-deoxy-D-Ido, and L-xylose (L-Xyl) against MOLT-4F cells and found that D-Sor, 6-deoxy-D-Ido, and L-Xyl showed no inhibitory activity at 5 mM, suggesting that the aldose structure and the C-6 hydroxy group of D-Ido are important for its activity. Cellular glucose uptake assay and western blotting analysis of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) expression suggested that the anti-proliferative activity of D-Ido is induced by inhibition of glucose uptake via TXNIP-independent pathway.""","""['Hironobu Ishiyama', 'Ryo C Yanagita', 'Kazune Takemoto', 'Natsumi Kitaguchi', 'Yuuki Uezato', 'Yasunori Sugiyama', 'Masashi Sato', 'Yasuhiro Kawanami']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""J Appl Glycosci (1999)""","""['Analysis of the inhibitory mechanism of D-allose on MOLT-4F leukemia cell proliferation.', 'Development of a d-allose-6-phosphate derivative with anti-proliferative activity against a human leukemia MOLT-4F cell line.', 'Anti-proliferative activity of 6-O-acyl-D-allose against the human leukemia MOLT-4F cell line.', 'D-allose: Molecular Pathways and Therapeutic Capacity in Cancer.', 'Microbial metabolism and biotechnological production of D-allose.']"""

Small molecule antagonists that bind to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the AR have been successful in treating PCa. However, the structural basis by which the AR antagonists manifest their therapeutic efficacy remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed structural information of the AR bound to the antagonists. We have performed accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations of LBDs bound to a set of ligands including a natural substrate (dihydrotestosterone), an agonist (RU59063) and three antagonists (bicalutamide, enzalutamide and apalutamide) as well as in the absence of ligand (apo). We show that the binding of AR antagonists at the substrate binding pocket alter the dynamic fluctuations of H12, thereby disrupting the structural integrity of the agonistic conformation of AR. Two antagonists, enzalutamide and apalutamide, induce considerable structural changes to the agonist conformation of LBD, when bound close to H12 of AR LBD. When the antagonists bind to the pocket with different orientations having close contact with H11, no significant conformational changes were observed, suggesting the AR remains in the functionally activated (agonistic) state. The simulations on a drug resistance mutant F876L bound to enzalutamide demonstrated that the mutation stabilizes the agonistic conformation of AR LBD, which compromises the efficacy of the antagonists. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the structural fluctuations shows that the binding of enzalutamide and apalutamide induce conformational fluctuations in the AR, which are markedly different from those caused by the agonist as well as another antagonist, bicalutamide.

Materials and methods:   Patients treated with prostate LDR between 2012 and 2019 (n=117) completed IPSS urinary symptom assessments prior to treatment and at each follow-up. CT simulation was obtained with urinary catheter 1-month post-implant for dosimetric analysis. 113 patients with pre- and ≥1 post-LDR IPSS score available were analyzed.

Methods:   Using SEER-Medicare claims, we identified men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer from 2010-2015 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/mL. Primary exposure was prebiopsy prostate MRI prior to diagnosis (i.e., CPT 72197 linked to urology-specific diagnosis). Outcomes included diagnosis of Grade Group 2+ disease on biopsy and proportion treated with prostatectomy. We assessed those treated with prostatectomy and evaluated association with prebiopsy MRI and grade concordance between biopsy and prostatectomy. We estimated adjusted odds ratios with multivariable regression after accounting for other factors (e.g., age, year, PSA, race/ethnicity).  Results:   We identified 48,574 patients, where 915 (1.9%) underwent prebiopsy MRI. Patients with prebiopsy MRI had more GG>2 cancer on biopsy (70.0% MRI vs. 62.8% no MRI) but lost significance after adjustment (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.96-1.30). Patients with prebiopsy MRI were more likely to have prostatectomy (39.2% vs. 28.5%, adjusted OR 1.51, 95%CI 1.31-1.76).

Although the regulations to PDK1 downstream substrates such as protein kinase B (AKT) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta (S6K) have been well established, the upstream regulators of PDK1, especially its degrader, has not been defined yet.  Method:   A clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-based E3 ligase screening approach was employed to identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase for degrading PDK1. Western blotting, immunoprecipitation assays and immunofluorescence (IF) staining were performed to detect the interaction or location of PDK1 with speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was used to study the expression of PDK1 and SPOP in prostate cancer tissues. In vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays were performed to measure the ubiquitination conjugation of PDK1 by SPOP. In vitro kinase assays and mass spectrometry approach were carried out to identify casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-mediated PDK1 phosphorylation. The biological effects of PDK1 mutations and correlation with SPOP mutations were performed with colony formation, soft agar assays and in vivo xenograft mouse models.  Results:   We identified that PDK1 underwent SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. Specifically, SPOP directly bound PDK1 by the consensus degron in a CK1/GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation dependent manner. Pathologically, prostate cancer patients associated mutations of SPOP impaired PDK1 degradation and thus activated the AKT kinase, resulting in tumor malignancies. Meanwhile, mutations that occurred around or within the PDK1 degron, by either blocking SPOP to bind the degron or inhibiting CK1 or GSK3β-mediated PDK1 phosphorylation, could markedly evade SPOP-mediated PDK1 degradation, and played potently oncogenic roles via activating the AKT kinase.  Conclusions:   Our results not only reveal a physiological regulation of PDK1 by E3 ligase SPOP, but also highlight the oncogenic roles of loss-of-function mutations of SPOP or gain-of-function mutations of PDK1 in tumorigenesis through activating the AKT kinase.""","""['Qiwei Jiang#', 'Nana Zheng#', 'Lang Bu#', 'Xiaomei Zhang', 'Xiaoling Zhang', 'Yuanzhong Wu', 'Yaqing Su', 'Lei Wang', 'Xiaomin Zhang', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Xiangpeng Dai', 'Depei Wu', 'Wei Xie', 'Wenyi Wei', 'Yasheng Zhu', 'Jianping Guo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['SPOP promotes CDCA5 degradation to regulate prostate cancer progression via the AKT pathway.', 'Tumor-suppressor role for the SPOP ubiquitin ligase in signal-dependent proteolysis of the oncogenic co-activator SRC-3/AIB1.', 'Mutated SPOP E3 Ligase Promotes 17βHSD4 Protein Degradation to Drive Androgenesis and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The emerging role of SPOP protein in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy.', 'Novel insights into the SPOP E3 ubiquitin ligase: From the regulation of molecular mechanisms to tumorigenesis.', 'Cooperative activation of PDK1 and AKT by MAPK4 enhances cancer growth and resistance to therapy.', 'The therapeutic mechanism of transcranial iTBS on nerve regeneration and functional recovery in rats with complete spinal cord transection.', 'LncRNAs and regulated cell death in tumor cells.', 'Cul3 substrate adaptor SPOP targets Nup153 for degradation.', 'USP20 is a predictor of poor prognosis in colorectal cancer and associated with lymph node metastasis, immune infiltration and chemotherapy resistance.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 803 patients who underwent cystoscopy prior to PB between January 2010 and September 2020. In cases of bladder tumor-like findings on cystoscopy, biopsy or transurethral resection of the bladder tumor was performed. The primary and secondary outcomes were the prevalence of incidental bladder cancer and pathological and oncological outcomes of incidental bladder cancer, respectively.  Results:   Incidental findings were observed in 31/803 patients (3.9%). Bladder tumor-like findings were found in 24/803 patients (3%), while 9/803 patients (1.1%) were pathologically diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma. The stage and grade of incidental bladder cancer were pTa in 8/9 patients and pT1 in 1/9 and low grade in 8/9 and high in 1/9, respectively. The median tumor size of the papillary pedunculated type was 0.5 cm. At 26-month median follow-up, no recurrence was observed.  Conclusion:   Cystoscopy during PB may yield incidental bladder cancer findings, although the prevalence is very low. Incidental bladder cancer was of low stage and grade, which seemed unrelated to survival. Moreover, performing routine cystoscopy in conjunction with PB is not recommended as it may lead to overdiagnosis of low-risk bladder cancer.""","""['Yoichiro Tohi', 'Yasuyuki Miyauchi', 'Mari Yamasaki', 'Kengo Fujiwara', 'Satoshi Harada', 'Iori Matsuda', 'Ayako Ito', 'Yuki Matsuoka', 'Takuma Kato', 'Rikiya Taoka', 'Hiroyuki Tsunemori', 'Nobufumi Ueda', 'Mikio Sugimoto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Incidental bladder cancers found on multiparametric MRI of the prostate gland: a single center experience.', 'Clinical significance of cystoscopy in transrectal prostate biopsy.', 'Can re-cTURBT be useful in pT1HG disease as a risk indicator of recurrence and progression?

Yet, the broader influence of radiation therapy on patient physiology is poorly understood. We conducted comprehensive global metabolomic profiling of urine, plasma, and stools sampled from patients undergoing PLNRT for high-risk prostate cancer.  Methods and materials:   Samples were taken from 32 patients at 6 timepoints: baseline, 2 to 3 and 4 to 5 weeks of PLNRT; and 3, 6, and 12 months after PLNRT. We characterized the global metabolome of urine and plasma using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and of stools with nuclear magnetic resonance. Linear mixed-effects modeling was used to investigate metabolic changes between timepoints for each biofluid and assay and determine metabolites of interest.  Results:   Metabolites in urine, plasma and stools changed significantly after PLNRT initiation. Metabolic profiles did not return to baseline up to 1 year post-PLNRT in any biofluid. Molecules associated with cardiovascular risk were increased in plasma. Pre-PLNRT fecal butyrate levels directly associated with increasing gastrointestinal side effects, as did a sharper fall in those levels during and up to 1 year postradiation therapy, mirroring our previous results with metataxonomics.  Conclusions:   We showed for the first time that an overall metabolic effect is observed in patients undergoing PLNRT up to 1 year posttreatment. These metabolic changes may effect on long-term morbidity after treatment, which warrants further investigation.""","""['Miguel R Ferreira', 'Caroline J Sands', 'Jia V Li', 'Jervoise N Andreyev', 'Elena Chekmeneva', 'Sarah Gulliford', 'Julian Marchesi', 'Matthew R Lewis', 'David P Dearnaley']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Repercussions of radiotherapy to the metabolism and microbiome.', 'The cost of elective nodal coverage in prostate cancer: Late quality of life outcomes and dosimetric analysis with 0, 45 or 54\xa0Gy to the pelvis.', 'Translational Metabolomics of Head Injury: Exploring Dysfunctional Cerebral Metabolism with Ex Vivo NMR Spectroscopy-Based Metabolite Quantification.', 'Combined Long-Term Androgen Deprivation and Pelvic Radiotherapy in the Post-operative Management of Pathologically Defined High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Results of the Prospective Phase II McGill 0913 Study.', 'Pivotal interplays between fecal metabolome and gut microbiome reveal functional signatures in cerebral ischemic stroke.', 'Metabolomic imaging of prostate cancer with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.', 'Microbiota as the unifying factor behind the hallmarks of cancer.', 'The gut microbiota as a booster for radiotherapy: novel insights into radio-protection and radiation injury.', 'Prospective, longitudinal analysis of the gut microbiome in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer predicts response to neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy.', 'Comment on ""Exploiting dietary fibre and the gut microbiota in pelvic radiotherapy patients"".', 'Gut Microbiota-Derived Short-Chain Fatty Acids: Impact on Cancer Treatment Response and Toxicities.']"""

Context:   Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography scans have higher sensitivity to detect metastatic prostate cancer than other imaging modalities, especially at lower prostate specific antigen (PSAs). This has led to proposals that prostate-specific membrane antigen be the gold standard to investigate men with a suspicion of prostate cancer. There is a trial underway in Australia examining the use of positron emission tomography prostate-specific membrane antigen in pre-biopsy men. Disparities in access to care and outcomes for prostate cancer for men in rural Australia are well documented. Incorporating positron emission tomography prostate-specific membrane antigen into the primary diagnostic pathway for prostate cancer creates a risk of further entrenching or worsening this inequity due to the lack of positron emission tomography scanners in rural locations.  Approach:   As a surrogate marker for restricted access, we determined the proportion of men over 50 more than 1.5 hours from a positron emission tomography scanner, with local government areas as the unit of assessment.  Conclusion:   Of the 505 local government areas, 309 were greater than 1.5 hours from the nearest positron emission tomography scanner. Of 3 793 865 men, over 50 585 689 lived in the 309 local government areas with restricted access to a positron emission tomography scanner. Our study highlights the risk of exacerbating inequalities in prostate cancer care experienced by men in rural areas. If positron emission tomography prostate-specific membrane antigen becomes the new gold standard, one in 6 men will face geographic barriers to access the standard of care. Future considerations of positron emission tomography prostate-specific membrane antigen must take this into account.""","""['James Macneil', 'Rachel Wilkins', 'Clair Whelan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Aust J Rural Health""","""['68Ga-PSMA Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography for Primary Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Men with Contraindications to or Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Prospective Observational Study.', 'Protocol for the PRIMARY clinical trial, a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study of the additive diagnostic value of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography/computed tomography to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnostic setting for men being investigated for prostate cancer.', 'Gallium-68 Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer-Updated Diagnostic Utility, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Distribution of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-avid Lesions: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Positron-emission tomography imaging in urological oncology: Current aspects and developments.']"""

Concerning gastrointestinal side effects, EBRT showed significantly higher rates of RTOG grade ≥ 2 toxicity compared to seeds, but at no point of the follow-up more than 10% of all patients. However, genitourinary side effects were significantly more prevalent in patients treated with seeds, with 33% RTOG grade ≥ 2 toxicity 12 months after treatment.

GX301 is a telomerase-based cancer vaccine whose safety and immunological effects were tested in a phase I trial applying an eight administrations schedule. Main objective of this study was to comparatively analyse safety and immunological response to three GX301 regimens in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with response/disease stability after docetaxel chemotherapy. This was a multicentre, randomized, parallel-group, open-label trial registered with EudraCT (2014-000095-26) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02293707, 2014). Ninety-eight patients were randomized to receive either eight (regimen 1), four (regimen 2) or two (regimen 3) vaccine administrations. Sixty-three patients were assessable for the primary immunological end-point. Vaccine-specific immune responses were evaluated by intracellular staining for IFN, elispot and cytotoxic assay at 90 and 180 days from baseline. No major side effects were recorded. A 54% overall immune responder rate was observed with 95% of patients showing at least one vaccine-specific immune response. Rate of immunological responders and number of immunizations were proportionally related, suggesting superiority of regimens 1 and 2 over regimen 3. Overall survival did not differ among regimens in both immunological responders and non-responders and was inversely associated (P = 0.002) with increase in the number of circulating CD8 + T regulatory cells at 180 days. These data indicate that GX301 cancer vaccine is safe and immunogenic in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.

Although studies have investigated causes of death among patients with localized PC, data are lacking regarding causes of death among patients with metastatic PC.  Objective:   To assess causes of death among US patients with metastatic PC from 2000 to 2016.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database to analyze a sample of 26 168 US men who received a diagnosis of metastatic PC from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2016. Data were analyzed from February 2 to July 28, 2020.  Exposure:   Diagnosis of metastatic PC.  Main outcomes and measures:   Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for different causes of death were calculated by dividing the observed number of deaths from each cause of death by the expected number of deaths in the age-matched US male population for the same period, adjusting for age and race/ethnicity.  Results:   Of 26 168 patients with metastatic PC included in the analysis, 48.9% were aged 50 to 70 years (mean age at diagnosis, 70.83 years); 74.5% were White individuals, and 72.7% received a diagnosis of stage M1b metastatic PC. A total of 16 732 patients (63.9%) died during the follow-up period. The mean age at death was 74.13 years. Most deaths (59.0%) occurred within the latency period of 2 years after diagnosis of metastatic PC, whereas 31.6% occurred 2 to 5 years after diagnosis and 9.4% occurred more than 5 years after diagnosis. Of the total deaths, 13 011 (77.8%) were from PC, 924 (5.5%) were from other cancers, and 2797 (16.7%) were from noncancer causes. During all latency periods, the most common noncancer causes of death were cardiovascular diseases (SMR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.26-1.42), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (SMR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03-1.36), and cerebrovascular diseases (SMR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.13-1.50).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, deaths from noncancer causes, including cardiovascular disease, constituted a substantial number of deaths among men with metastatic PC.

Materials and methods:   We created SIB-hHF-RT plans for 14 nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients with MRI-detectable intraprostatic lesions (IPLs) and without intestines locating close to the seminal vesicle and prostate. We prescribed 57 Gy for IPLs and 54 Gy for the remainder of planning target volume (PTV) in 15 fractions. The IPLs were contoured based on magnetic resonance imaging, and PTV was generated by adding 6-8-mm margins to the clinical target volume. For the dose-volume constraints of organs at risk (OARs), the same constraints as 54 Gy plans were used so as not to increase the toxicity.  Results:   All created plans fulfilled the dose-volume constraints of all targets and OARs. The median estimated beam-on time was 108.5 s. For patient-specific quality assurance, the global gamma passing rates (3%/2 mm) with 10% dose threshold criteria were greater than 93% in all cases and greater than 95% in 11 cases.

Alternol triggered ICD in prostate cancer cells, as evidenced by the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (i.e., calreticulin, CALR; high mobility group protein B1, HMGB1; and adenosine triphosphate, ATP) and pro-inflammatory cytokine (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8) expression. Alternol facilitated tumor-associated antigen uptake and cross-presentation, CD8 + T-cell priming, and T-cell infiltration in tumor-draining lymph nodes (LNs) and tumors. The presence of Alternol fostered antitumor immune response in vivo, resulting in delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival. Moreover, inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation blocked Alternol-induced upregulation of pre-inflammation cytokines, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and consequent antitumor immune response.

Herein we present the in vitro study for developing applications based on this new technology. In this study, we used flow cytometric analysis, cell viability assay, caspase activity analysis, wound healing assay, confocal microscopy study, and immunofluorescence to investigate the biological effect of high-frequency nsPEFs on PCa cells. Our results show that high-frequency nsPEFs induces the permeabilization and cell death of PCa cells. The cytotoxicity is significantly enhanced in MHz compression of pulses and with the presence of extracellular Ca2+. High-frequency nsPEFs trigger changes in PCa cells' cytoskeleton and their mobility. The presented data show a therapeutic potential of high-frequency nsPEFs in a PCa setting.

Here we introduce Differential Subclone Eradication and Resistance (DSER) analysis, a method developed to identify molecular targets for improved therapy by direct comparison of genomic features of eradicated and resistant subclones in pre- and posttreatment samples from a patient with BRCA2-deficient metastatic prostate cancer. FANCI and EYA4 were identified as candidate DNA repair-related targets for converting subclones from resistant to eradicable, and RNAi-mediated depletion of FANCI confirmed it as a potential target. The EYA4 alteration was associated with adjacent L1 transposon insertion during cancer evolution upon treatment, raising questions surrounding the role of therapy in L1 activation. Both carboplatin and enzalutamide turned on L1 transposon machinery in LNCaP and VCaP but not in PC3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines. L1 activation in LNCaP and VCaP was inhibited by the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine. L1 activation was also detected postcastration in LuCaP 77 and LuCaP 105 xenograft models and postchemotherapy in previously published time-series transcriptomic data from SCC25 head and neck cancer cells. In conclusion, DSER provides an informative intermediate step toward effective precision cancer medicine and should be tested in future studies, especially those including dramatic but temporary metastatic tumor regression. L1 transposon activation may be a modifiable source of cancer genomic heterogeneity, suggesting the potential of leveraging newly discovered triggers and blockers of L1 activity to overcome therapy resistance.

Different adaptive radiotherapy (ART) strategies were evaluated with regard to dosimetric benefits.  Methods:   Treatments plans for 32 patients were retrospectively generated and analyzed according to the PACE-C trial treatment scheme (40 Gy in 5 fractions). Using a previously trained cycle-generative adversarial network algorithm, synthetic CT (sCT) were generated out of five daily cone-beam CT. Dose calculation on sCT was performed for four different adaptation approaches: IGRT without adaptation, adaptation via segment aperture morphing (SAM) and segment weight optimization (ART1) or additional shape optimization (ART2) as well as a full re-optimization (ART3). Dose distributions were evaluated regarding dose-volume parameters and a penalty score.  Results:   Compared to the IGRT approach, the ART1, ART2 and ART3 approaches substantially reduced the V37Gy(bladder) and V36Gy(rectum) from a mean of 7.4cm3 and 2.0cm3 to (5.9cm3, 6.1cm3, 5.2cm3) as well as to (1.4cm3, 1.4cm3, 1.0cm3), respectively. Plan adaptation required on average 2.6 min for the ART1 approach and yielded doses to the rectum being insignificantly different from the ART2 approach. Based on an accumulation over the total patient collective, a penalty score revealed dosimetric violations reduced by 79.2%, 75.7% and 93.2% through adaptation.  Conclusion:   Treatment plan adaptation was demonstrated to adequately restore relevant dose criteria on a daily basis. While for SAM adaptation approaches dosimetric benefits were realized through ensuring sufficient target coverage, a full re-optimization mainly improved OAR sparing which helps to guide the decision of when to apply which adaptation strategy.""","""['Miriam Eckl', 'Gustavo R Sarria', 'Sandra Springer', 'Marvin Willam', 'Arne M Ruder', 'Volker Steil', 'Michael Ehmann', 'Frederik Wenz', 'Jens Fleckenstein']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Dosimetric Evaluation of Incorporating Patient Geometric Variations Into Adaptive Plan Optimization Through Probabilistic Treatment Planning in Head and Neck Cancers.', 'Simulated daily plan adaptation for magnetic resonance-guided liver stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'A treatment planning study comparing IMRT techniques and cyber knife for stereotactic body radiotherapy of low-risk prostate carcinoma.', 'Dosimetric Benefits and Practical Pitfalls of Daily Online Adaptive MRI-Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy for Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Adaptive radiation therapy: When, how and what are the benefits that literature provides?', 'Adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation for intact localized prostate cancer how to optimally test a rapidly emerging technology.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.']"""

Many patients have undergone prior radiotherapy for prostate, urothelial, colorectal, or gynecologic malignancy. We sought to evaluate the differences between ureteroenteric stricture occurrence between patients who had radiation prior to urinary diversion and those who did not.  Methods:   An IRB-approved cystectomy database was utilized to identify ureteroenteric strictures among 215 patients who underwent urinary diversion at a single academic center between 2016 and 2020. Chart abstraction was conducted to determine the presence of confirmed stricture in these patients, defined as endoscopic diagnosis or definitive imaging findings. Strictures due to malignant ureteral recurrence were excluded (3 patients). Statistical analysis was performed using chi squared test, t-test, and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis of stricture by cancer type.  Results:   65 patients had radiation prior to urinary diversion; 150 patients did not have a history of radiation therapy. Benign ureteroenteric stricture rate was 5.3% (8/150) in the non-radiated cohort and 23% (15/65) in the radiated cohort (p = < 0.001). Initial management of stricture was percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) in 78% (18/23) and the remaining 22% (5/23) were managed with primary retrograde ureteral stent placement. Long term management included ureteral reimplantation in 30.4% (7/23).  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrates a significant increase in rate of ureteroenteric strictures in radiated patients as compared to non-radiated patients. The insult of radiation on the ureteral microvascular supply is likely implicated in the cause of these strictures.

We aimed to investigate whether lung protective ventilation has adverse impact on hemodynamic, renal and hormonal variables.  Methods:   In this randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled study, 24 patients scheduled for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were included. Patients were equally randomized to receive either ventilation with a TV of 6 ml/IBW and PEEP of 10 cm H2O (LTV-h.PEEP) or ventilation with a TV of 10 ml/IBW and PEEP of 4 cm H2O (HTV-l.PEEP). Before, during and after surgery, hemodynamic variables were measured, and blood and urine samples were collected. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma concentrations of electrolytes and vasoactive hormones. Urine samples were analyzed for excretions of electrolytes and markers of nephrotoxicity.  Results:   Comparable variables were found among the two groups, except for significantly higher postoperative levels of plasma brain natriuretic peptide (p = 0.033), albumin excretion (p = 0.012) and excretion of epithelial sodium channel (p = 0.045) in the LTV-h.PEEP ventilation group compared to the HTV-l.PEEP ventilation group.

Materials and methods:   We conducted a comparative effectiveness trial, recruiting 32 Commission on Cancer-accredited centers in 2015-2016. Sites were characterized as one of three models: 1) Single Consultative visit, 2) Specialized Longitudinal care with ongoing visits at predetermined intervals, 3) Oncology-Embedded care with visits as needed. We included breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors who had completed active treatment but had not yet attended a survivorship visit (n = 991). Quality of life was assessed using 20 physical, 14 social/emotional, and 7 practical concerns, adapted from the Quality of Life-Breast Cancer Survivors and Functional Living Index Cancer scales.1,2 We used frequencies to describe prevalent symptoms and ANOVA to test for global differences in concerns by survivorship care model, post-hoc Tukey's test for pairwise comparisons, and mixed-effects models to describe changes in quality of life by care model over six-months.  Results:   While unadjusted results suggested that nearly all concerns worsened over six months, no differences were observed in quality of life concerns by care model for physical or practical concerns. At baseline, social/emotional concerns showed a global difference by model (p = 0.008; pairwise results showed fewer concerns among Oncology-Embedded survivors compared to Specialized Consultative survivors; 12.1 vs 15.2, p < 0.05), but no differences were found at six months (global p = 0.311).

Methods:   This secondary data analysis utilized information from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The primary exposure was self-reported health literacy, and the primary outcome was whether patients underwent prior PSA testing. Males 55-69 years old from 13 states were included in the study and were excluded if they had any missing data. Participants were categorized into low, moderate, or high level of health literacy. Confounders were adjusted for using binary logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated.  Results:   A total of 12,149 participants were included. Five percent of participants reported low health literacy, 54% moderate health literacy, and 41% high health literacy. Compared with study participants who self-reported high levels of health literacy, the odds of undergoing PSA testing were 59% lower in those with low health literacy (OR 0.41; 95% CI 0.28-0.64) and 30% lower in those with moderate health literacy (OR 0.70; 95% CI 0.60-0.83).  Conclusions:   Our research demonstrates a positive association between self-reported health literacy and the likelihood of PSA screening.

Patients and methods:   A cohort of 293 men with isolated HGPIN detected in previous biopsies performed without multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), and who underwent repeat biopsy within 1 to 3 years, was analysed. Pre-repeat biopsy mpMRI and guided biopsies to suspicious lesions (Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] ≥3) and/or and systematic biopsies were performed. Persistent prostate cancer (PCa) suspicion, defined as sustained serum prostate-specific antigen level >4 ng/mL and/or abnormal digital rectal examination, was present in 248 men (84.6%), and was absent in 45 men (15.4%). A control group of 190 men who had no previous HGPIN, atypical small acinar proliferation or HGPIN with atypia who were scheduled to undergo repeat biopsy due to persistent PCa suspicion were also analysed. csPCa was defined as tumours of Grade Group ≥2.  Results:   In the subset of 45 men with isolated HGPIN, in whom PCa suspicion disappeared, only one csPCa (2.2%) and one insignificant PCa (iPCa) were detected. csPCa was detected in 34.7% of men with persistent PCa suspicion and previous HGPIN, and in 28.4% of those without previous HGPIN (P =0.180). iPCa was detected in 12.1% and 6.3%, respectively (P =0.039). Logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of csPCa detection was not predicted by previous HGPIN: odds ratio (OR) 1.369 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.894-2.095; P =0.149); however, previous HGPIN increased the risk of iPCa detection: OR 2.043 (95% CI 1.016-4.109; P =0.006).  Conclusion:   The risk of csPCa in men with isolated HGPIN, in whom PCa suspicion disappears, is extremely low. Moreover, in those men in whom PCa suspicion persists, the risk of csPCa is not influenced by the previous finding of HGPIN. However, previous HGPIN increases the risk of iPCa detection. Therefore, repeat prostate biopsy should not be recommended solely because of a previous HGPIN.""","""['Juan Morote', 'Iván Schwartzmann', 'Anna Celma', 'Sarai Roche', 'Inés M de Torres', 'Richard Mast', 'Maria E Semidey', 'Lucas Regis', 'Anna Santamaria', 'Jacques Planas', 'Enrique Trilla']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer after negative prostate biopsy: The current value of microscopic findings.', 'The current value of histological findings in negative prostate biopsies to predict the future risk of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Expression of ERG protein, a prostate cancer specific marker, in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): lack of utility to stratify cancer risks associated with HGPIN.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.']"""

The purpose of our study was to examine the association between quantitative prostate compositional metrics by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and Pca.  Methods:   We identified 405 patients who underwent prostate MRI and biopsy and/or prostatectomy from January 2019 to January 2021 at our institution. Segmentation volumetric methods were used to assess central gland (CG) and peripheral zone (PZ) volume. PZ mean thickness and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), marker of underlying histologic components, were measured. Multivariable logistic regression was performed with outcomes of ≥Grade Group (GG) 2 Pca and for multifocal disease.  Results:   On multivariable analysis, higher CG volumes were at lower odds of ≥GG2 disease (n = 227) (OR: 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, p < 0.0001), taking into account PZ volume (p = 0.18) and thickness (p = 0.70). For every one cc increase in CG volume, there was an approximately 3% decrease in odds of ≥GG2 disease. Similar findings were noted for multifocal disease (n = 180) (OR: 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, p < 0.0001). Notably, ADC of the normal PZ was not significantly associated with CG volume (p = 0.21) nor a predictor of disease (p = 0.49).  Conclusions:   Increasing central gland volume, driven by BPH, is associated with lower odds of significant Pca, including multifocal disease, while PZ anatomic and histologic surrogate changes were noncontributory. Findings support BPH impediment of global tumor growth predicted by theoretical mechanobiological model. This potential stabilizing factor should be further studied for risk stratification and in consideration for BPH therapy.""","""['Kiran R Nandalur', 'Robert Colvin', 'David Walker', 'Sirisha R Nandalur', 'Brian Seifman', 'David Gangwish', 'Jason Hafron']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Impact of the bladder detrusor muscular ring on lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia: A quantitative MRI analysis.', 'Association between prostate size and glandular tissue volume of the peripheral zone via novel combined MRI and histopathology: possible pathophysiological implications on prostate cancer development.', 'Revisiting quantitative multi-parametric MRI of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its differentiation from transition zone cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Any Correlation Between Prostate Volume and Incidence of Prostate Cancer: A Review of Reported Data for the Last Thirty Years.']"""

In spite of extreme developments for increasing survival rate, there are still limitations about common treatment options such as surgical procedures, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. We hypothesized that combination of two treatments would bring better clinical outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of conjugated cisplatin and low-level laser treatment (LLLT) on the viability of LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. LNCaP cells were harvested in DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic. Confluent cells were treated with different concentrations of cisplatin and different wavelengths of low-level laser (LLL) alone and in combination. The relative IC50 and cell viability was evaluated using MTT assay. Analysis of lipid peroxidation rate was performed using lipid peroxidation assay kit. LDH activity was also carried out on the treated and control cells using LDH cytotoxicity assay kit. Our results showed that combination of cisplatin and LLLT could effectively decrease cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity as well as LNCaP cell viability. Cisplatin-LLLT combination led to a significant increase in the MDA content as the product of membrane lipid peroxidation. Analyzing the LDH activity under the effect of cisplatin-LLL combined treatment showed a remarkable increase in the enzyme activity. We conclude that applying the cisplatin-LLL combination therapy is promising as an effective anti-cancer treatment.

With hybrid PET/MRI, the advantages of MRI are added to molecular characteristic of PET. The aim of this study was to investigate the incremental value of PET/MR versus PET/CT in patients with biochemically recurrent PCa by head-to-head comparison.  Methods:   Thirty-four patients with biochemically recurrent PCa were prospectively included. They underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, followed by simultaneous PET/MR. All PET (PETCT, PETMR), CT and MR images were evaluated for number of lesions and location. The number of lesions at specific sites was compared using Wilcoxon-sign-rank test. For PET, the maximum and mean standardised uptake values (SUVs) were calculated for each lesion compared using a two-sided paired t test.  Results:   PETCT and PETMR scans were positive in 19 and 20 patients, detecting 73 and 79 lesions respectively. All lesions detected on PETCT were also detected on PETMR. CT and MRI only were positive in 14 and 17 patients, detecting 38 and 50 lesions, respectively, which was significantly lower than PETCT and PETMR respectively. Combined interpretation showed more lesions on PET/MR than on PET/CT (88 vs 81). No significant difference in detection of presence of local recurrence nor distant metastases was found. SUVmean and SUVmax values were significantly higher on PETMR than on PETCT in local recurrence and lymph node metastases.  Conclusions:   [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR was able to detect biochemically recurrent PCa at least as accurately as PET/CT for local recurrence, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis.

Subjects:   Three hundred sixteen prostate mpMRI scans and 312 men (median age 67).  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T; fast spin echo T2WI, echo planar imaging DWI, ADC, gradient-echo dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE).  Assessment:   MRI scans were reviewed by three genitourinary radiologists (V.P., M.D.M., S.C.) with 21, 12, and 5 years of experience, respectively. Sequences were labeled as high quality (Q1) or low quality (Q0) and used as the reference standard for all analyses.  Statistical tests:   Sequences were split into training, validation, and testing sets (869, 250, and 120 sequences, respectively). Inter-reader agreement was assessed with the Fleiss kappa. Following preprocessing and data augmentation, 28 CNNs were trained on MRI slices for each sequence. Model performance was assessed on both a per-slice and a per-sequence basis. A pairwise t-test was performed to compare performances of the classifiers.  Results:   The number of sequences labeled as Q0 or Q1 was 38 vs. 278 for T2WI, 43 vs. 273 for DWI, 41 vs. 275 for ADC, and 38 vs. 253 for DCE. Inter-reader agreement was almost perfect for T2WI and DCE and substantial for DWI and ADC.

However, potentiating factors for SREs in patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer are not well elucidated.  Methods:   We analyzed the clinical data from a controlled arm of a clinical trial comparing denosumab with zoledronate in patients with bone metastatic, castration resistant prostate cancer (ClinicalTrial.gov ID: NCT00321620) available at Project Data Sphere, a broad-access research platform. The primary endpoint was the first SRE after the inclusion to the trial, and the time to the first SRE was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model based on patients' baseline characteristics including age, race, ECOG performance status (PS), Gleason score, TNM stage at diagnosis, metastasis pattern, and urine and serum laboratory data.  Results:   Seven hundred ten patients without documented history of osteopenia or osteoporosis whose data was available in the zoledronate arm of the trial were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 71 years old, the median follow-up was 225 days, and 295 patients (42%) had at least one SRE during this period. The univariate analysis showed that history of SREs, Gleason score ≥ 7, elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and high urine N-telopeptide cross-links/creatinine ratio (NTx/Cre) are significant baseline risk factors for SREs. Patients with the characteristics of history of SREs, Gleason score ≥ 7 and elevated serum ALP also showed a significantly higher hazard ratio of SREs in multivariate analysis.

Here, we successfully develop active targeted UCNP as potential probes for dual NIR-NIR fluorescence and radioactive-guided surgery of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)(+) prostate cancers. We designed a one-pot thermolysis synthesis method to obtain oleic acid-coated spherical NaYF4:Yb,Tm@NaYF4 core/shell UCNP with narrow particle size distribution (30.0 ± 0.1 nm, as estimated by SAXS analysis) and efficient upconversion luminescence. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) ligands bearing different anchoring groups (phosphate, bis- and tetra-phosphonate-based) were synthesized and used to hydrophilize the UCNP. DLS studies led to the selection of a tetra-phosphonate PEG(2000) ligand affording water-dispersible UCNP with sustained colloidal stability in several aqueous media. PSMA-targeting ligands (i.e., glutamate-urea-lysine derivatives called KuEs) and fluorescent or radiolabelled prosthetic groups were grafted onto the UCNP surface by strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC). These UCNP, coated with 10 or 100% surface density of KuE ligands, did not induce cytotoxicity over 24 h incubation in LNCaP-Luc or PC3-Luc prostate cancer cell lines or in human fibroblasts for any of the concentrations evaluated. Competitive binding assays and flow cytometry demonstrated the excellent affinity of UCNP@KuE for PSMA-positive LNCaP-Luc cells compared with non-targeted UCNP@CO2H. Furthermore, the binding of UCNP@KuE to prostate tumour cells was positively correlated with the surface density of PSMA-targeting ligands and maintained after 125I-radiolabelling.

We previously created tumor-suppressive secretomes by activating Wnt signaling in MSCs. Here, we examined whether the anti-tumor secretomes can be produced from tumor cells. Methods: Wnt signaling was activated in tumor cells by overexpressing β-catenin or administering BML284, a Wnt activator. Their conditioned medium (CM) was applied to cancer cells or tissues, and the effects of CM were evaluated. Tumor growth in the mammary fat pad and tibia in C57BL/6 female mice was also evaluated through μCT imaging and histology. Whole-genome proteomics analysis was conducted to determine and characterize novel tumor-suppressing proteins, which were enriched in CM. Results: The overexpression of β-catenin or the administration of BML284 generated tumor-suppressive secretomes from breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer cells. In the mouse model, β-catenin-overexpressing CM reduced tumor growth and tumor-driven bone destruction. This inhibition was also observed with BML284-treated CM. Besides p53 and Trail, proteomics analysis revealed that CM was enriched with enolase 1 (Eno1) and ubiquitin C (Ubc) that presented notable tumor-suppressing actions. Importantly, Eno1 immunoprecipitated CD44, a cell-surface adhesion receptor, and its silencing suppressed Eno1-driven tumor inhibition. A pan-cancer survival analysis revealed that the downregulation of MMP9, Runx2 and Snail by CM had a significant impact on survival outcomes (p < 0.00001). CM presented a selective inhibition of tumor cells compared to non-tumor cells, and it downregulated PD-L1, an immune escape modulator. Conclusions: The tumor-suppressive secretome can be generated from tumor cells, in which β-catenin presented two opposing roles, as an intracellular tumor promoter in tumor cells and a generator of extracellular tumor suppressor in CM. Eno1 was enriched in CM and its interaction with CD44 was involved in Eno1's anti-tumor action. Besides presenting a potential option for treating primary cancers and metastases, the result indicates that aggressive tumors may inhibit the growth of less aggressive tumors via tumor-suppressive secretomes.""","""['Shengzhi Liu', 'Xun Sun', 'Kexin Li', 'Rongrong Zha', 'Yan Feng', 'Tomohiko Sano', 'Chuanpeng Dong', 'Yunlong Liu', 'Uma K Aryal', 'Akihiro Sudo', 'Bai-Yan Li', 'Hiroki Yokota']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Suppression of breast cancer-associated bone loss with osteoblast proteomes via Hsp90ab1/moesin-mediated inhibition of TGFβ/FN1/CD44 signaling.', 'Counterintuitive production of tumor-suppressive secretomes from Oct4- and c-Myc-overexpressing tumor cells and MSCs.', 'Inhibition of the Growth of Breast Cancer-Associated Brain Tumors by the Osteocyte-Derived Conditioned Medium.', 'Alpha-Enolase (ENO1), a potential target in novel immunotherapies.', 'Enolase 1, a Moonlighting Protein, as a Potential Target for Cancer Treatment.', 'Suppression of osteosarcoma progression by engineered lymphocyte-derived proteomes.', 'Three unconventional maxims in the natural selection of cancer cells: Generation of induced tumor-suppressing cells (iTSCs).', 'Osteosarcoma-enriched transcripts paradoxically generate osteosarcoma-suppressing extracellular proteins.', 'Proteomes from AMPK-inhibited peripheral blood mononuclear cells suppress the progression of breast cancer and bone metastasis.', 'The Double-Edged Proteins in Cancer Proteomes and the Generation of Induced Tumor-Suppressing Cells (iTSCs).']"""

Methods: The study included a training cohort to identify an SUVmax cutoff value and a prospective real-world cohort to validate it. A retrospective analysis assessed 135 patients with suspected PCa in a large tertiary care hospital in China who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. All patients were suspected of having PCa based on symptoms, digital rectal examination (DRE), total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) level, and multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). The 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT results were evaluated using histopathological results from transrectal ultrasound-guided 12-core biopsy with necessary targeted biopsy as references. Patients with Gleason scores (GS) ≥7 from the biopsy results were diagnosed with csPCa, and patients with negative biopsy and follow-up results were diagnosed with BPD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify the optimal SUVmax cutoff value. The cutoff value was prospectively validated in 58 patients with suspected PCa. The diagnostic benefits of the cutoff value for clinical decision making were also evaluated. Results: According to ROC curve analysis, the most appropriate SUVmax cutoff value for discriminating csPCa from BPD was 5.30 (sensitivity, 85.85%; specificity, 86.21%; area under the curve [AUC], 0.893). The cutoff achieved a sensitivity of 83.33%, a specificity of 81.25%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 92.11%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 65.00%, and an accuracy of 82.76% in the prospective validation cohort. Metastases were used as an indicator to reduce false negative results in patients with SUVmax ≤ 5.30. In patients without metastases, an SUVmax value of 5.30 was also the best cutoff to diagnose localized csPCa (sensitivity, 80.43%; specificity, 86.21%; AUC, 0.852). The cutoff discriminated localized csPCa from BPD with a sensitivity of 76.19%, a specificity of 81.25%, a PPV of 84.21%, an NPV of 72.22%, and an accuracy of 78.38% in the prospective validation cohort. The cutoff, combined with metastases, achieved an accuracy of 89.12% in all patients, increasing accuracy by 8.29% and reducing equivocal results compared with manual reading. There was a strong correlation between SUVmax and PSMA expression (rs = 0.831, P < 0.001) and a moderate correlation between SUVmax and GS (rs = 0.509, P < 0.001). The PSMA expression and SUVmax values of patients with csPCa were significantly higher than those of patients with BPD (P < 0.001). Conclusion: We established and prospectively validated the best SUVmax cutoff value (5.30) for discriminating csPCa from BPD with high accuracy in patients with suspected PCa. 5.30 is an effective cutoff to discriminate csPCa patients with or without metastases. The cutoff may provide a potential tool for the precise identification of csPCa by 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, ensuring high accuracy and reducing equivocal results.""","""['Jianhua Jiao', 'Fei Kang', 'Jingliang Zhang', 'Zhiyong Quan', 'Weihong Wen', 'Xiaohu Zhao', 'Shuaijun Ma', 'Peng Wu', 'Fa Yang', 'Wei Guo', 'Xiaojian Yang', 'Jianlin Yuan', 'Yongquan Shi', 'Jing Wang', 'Weijun Qin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Prospective Evaluation of 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Primary Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The use of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT to stratify patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions according to clinically significant prostate cancer risk.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-targeted biopsy for Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Early treatment response at the first restaging after two therapy cycles might correlate with high treatment efficacy and long overall survival (OS). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether early reduction in tumor volume is a positive prognosticator for OS. To this end, PSMA PET prior to therapy (baseline) and at first restaging after two therapy cycles (interim; i.e., 12 weeks) were compared. Methods: Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received Lu-PSMA therapy were reviewed for this analysis. All patients with available baseline and interim [68Ga]-PSMA-11 PET/CT were included in this analysis (n = 33). All PSMA avid metastases in baseline and interim PETs were semi-automatically segmented. The average PSMA expression (mean SUVmax of all metastases), total tumor volume (PSMA-TV) and TLQ (quotients of tumor volume and SUVmean summed over all metastases) were quantified at baseline and interim timepoints. Response in PSMA-TV was assumed when a decline > 30% was present. OS and biochemical response were available for all patients. Results: Baseline PSMA-TV was a statistically significant prognosticator of OS (HR = 1.618 95%CI: 1.117 - 2.343, p = 0.011). Reduction in PSMA-TV was not a statistically significant positive prognosticator of OS in the total cohort (HR = 0.829 95%CI: 0.559 - 1.230, p = 0.352). Likewise, there was no statistical difference in survival time comparing patients with PSMA-TV response to those without (13.2 vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.1). In the subgroup of patients with PSMA-TV response, mean SUVmax was a statistically significant prognosticator of OS (binarized by median; HR = 0.15; 95%CI: 0.03 - 0.83; p < 0.05). If patients with low PSMA expression at baseline were excluded from the analysis, reduction in PSMA-TV became a positive prognosticator of OS in uni- and multivariable Cox regression (HR = 0.290; 95%CI: 0.108 - 0.782; p = 0.015). Conclusion: PSMA-TV reduction was a positive prognosticator of OS only if patients with low PSMA expression were excluded. This might indicate that the PSMA-PETs of patients with low PSMA expression may not be suited for assessing PSMA-TV reduction.

Despite the efficiency of primary endocrine prostate cancer therapies, more efficient drugs are needed to tackle the most advanced and resistant forms of this condition. The present study investigated the antitumor effects of low-dose bufalin combined with hydroxycamptothecin on castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in mice, as well as the possible mechanisms of apoptosis induction. CRPC xenograft tumors were generated in mice and, subsequently, mice received appropriate doses of bufalin, hydroxycamptothecin or a combination of the two drugs. Tumors from each treatment group were removed, and the tumor volume, weight and inhibition rate of each group was determined. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed for pathological analysis and TUNEL staining was used to assess the level of apoptosis in the xenografts. Immunohistochemistry was used for the analysis of proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and the expression of Bax, Bcl-XL, p53, programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), phosphorylated (p)-AKT and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β was determined by western blotting. Treatment with bufalin significantly (P<0.05) reduced tumor volumes compared with the negative control group, reducing tumor volumes to lower levels when combined with hydroxycampothecin. The combination of bufalin (0.6 or 0.8 mg/kg) and hydroxycampothecin significantly (P<0.05) induced higher levels of cell apoptosis compared with the administration of bufalin or hydroxycampothecin alone. The combination of bufalin and hydroxycampothecin also increased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins Bax, p53, PDCD4 and GSK-3β, and decreased the expression of Bcl-XL and p-AKT compared with a single drug treatment. The present study suggested that the combination of bufalin and hydroxycampothecin improved the inhibitory effects of both drugs on CRPC tumors in vivo, potentially via the regulation of the PI3K/AKT/GSK-3β and p53-dependent apoptosis signaling pathways.""","""['Renze Gu', 'Qingchuan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Exp Ther Med""","""['Effect of bufalin on proliferation and apoptosis through ERK/RSK2 pathway in human esophageal carcinoma cell line xenografts in nude mice.', 'Inhibition action of bufalin on human transplanted hepatocellular tumor and its effects on expressions of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins in nude mice.', 'Combination of carmustine and selenite effectively inhibits tumor growth by targeting androgen receptor, androgen receptor-variants, and Akt in preclinical models: New hope for patients with castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Rooibos suppresses proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Akt signaling.', 'Anti-tumor activity and apoptosis-regulation mechanisms of bufalin in various cancers: new hope for cancer patients.', 'Toad venom-derived bufadienolides and their therapeutic application in prostate cancers: Current status and future directions.', 'Novel Strategies for Solubility and Bioavailability Enhancement of Bufadienolides.']"""

A prognostic nomogram for first-line mCRPC treatment was developed from patients treated in the PREVAIL study.  Objective:   To validate the Armstrong model in the COU-AA-302 trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   A post hoc analysis of mCRPC patients treated in the COU-AA-302 trial was carried out (NCT00887198).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The Armstrong prognostic model was applied to patients treated in COU-AA-302. A continuous risk score was derived from coefficients from the original model. Time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC) was used to evaluate the overall predictive ability of the model. Patients were categorized according to the number of risk factors present into those at a low (three or fewer risk factors), intermediate (four to six risk factors), and high (seven to ten risk factors) risk. The association with survival was assessed with Cox regression models. Interaction tests were used to assess the impact of treatment arm in each of the prognostic groups.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1088 patients were analyzed. The risk score was associated with overall survival (OS; tAUC 0.733). Most patients were at a low (49%) or intermediate (41%) risk. Risk category was significantly associated with OS (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-2.4; p < 0.001), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.8; p < 0.001), and prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (HR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.9; p < 0.001). A significant interaction between risk group and OS (p = 0.007) and rPFS (p = 0.009) was observed. Survival was superior in low-risk patients (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59-0.89; p = 0.009), but similar in intermediate-risk (HR: 0.97; 95% CI: 0.79-1.21; p = 0.9) and high-risk (HR: 1.35; 95% CI: 0.80-2.28; p = 0.5) patients. Two-year OS rates in abiraterone versus placebo were 82% versus 74% in low-risk, 55% versus 52% in intermediate-risk, and 28% versus 31% in high-risk patients.  Conclusions:   We validate the prognostic value of the Armstrong risk model in patients treated with first-line androgen receptor signaling inhibitors. Abiraterone provided a greater benefit in low-risk patients with less aggressive disease. Further research is needed to establish the role of Armstrong risk groups for treatment selection in mCRPC patients.  Patient summary:   In this report, we validated the Armstrong nomogram in the COU-AA-302 trial population. We found a similar prognostic performance to that of the original model.

We assessed the cost effectiveness of these reflex tests in the United States.  Methods:   We used an existing microsimulation model of prostate cancer (PCa) progression and survival to predict lifetime outcomes for a hypothetical cohort of 55-year-old men with intermediate PSA levels. Urine-based biomarkers-PCa antigen (PCA3), TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion (T2:ERG), and the MyProstateScore (MPS) for any PCa and for high-grade (Gleason score ≥7) PCa (MPShg)-were generated using biomarker data from 1112 men presenting for biopsy at 10 United States institutions. MRI results were based on published sensitivity and specificity for high-grade PCa. Costs and utilities were sourced from literature and Medicare reimbursement schedules. Outcome measures included life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime medical costs per patient. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were empirically calculated on the basis of simulated life histories under different reflex testing strategies.  Results:   Biopsying all men provided the most life years and QALYs, followed by reflex testing using MPShg, MPS, MRI, T2:ERG, PCA3, and biopsying no men (QALY range across strategies 15.98-16.09). Accounting for costs, MRI and MPShg were dominated by other strategies. PCA3, T2:ERG, and MPS were likely to be the most cost-effective strategy at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $100 000/QALY, $125 000/QALY, and $150 000/QALY, respectively.

Weighted multivariable-adjusted logistic regression was applied to evaluate the association. Then, we performed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the possible causal effect of coffee on prostate cancer risk. Primary and secondary genetic instruments were obtained from genome-wide association studies among 375,833 and 91,462 individuals separately.

Inverse variance weighted (IVW) was the primary analytical method. Through selection, we enrolled 8336 individuals (weighted number = 58,796,070) for our observational study in NHANES. Results suggested that there was no association between coffee and prostate cancer. MR analyses with primary genetic instruments also did not support a causal association between coffee intake and prostate cancer risk, whether using summary data from PRACTICAL (IVW: OR 1.001, 95% CI 0.997-1.005) or FinnGen (IVW: OR 1.005, 95% CI 0.998-1.012).

However, few studies have systematically appraised their quality or compared outcomes to pivotal trials.  Methods:   All RWD studies (2010-2019) for drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) from 2010 to 2015 for solid organ tumours in the non-curative setting were identified. Quality assessment was undertaken using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Survival differences between each RWD study and the pivotal trial were determined using a related sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   293 RWD studies for 45 of the 57 drug indications approved by the FDA/EMA were identified. The most common tumour types were prostate cancer (29%, n = 86) and melanoma (15%, n = 43). A quarter of the studies had industry funding. No high-quality studies were identified, and 78% were low quality. Comparative survival analysis between RWD and pivotal trials was possible for 224 studies (37 drug indications). Differences in median survival between the RWD studies and their corresponding trial ranged from -32 months to 21 months (IQR -4·2 months to 1·6 months). Low-quality studies were more likely to report superior survival outcomes (23%) compared to higher quality studies (8%) (p = 0.02).

Patients and methods:   mCRPC patients were randomised to first-line docetaxel with maintenance or suspension of ADT. Patients attaining a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response after four chemotherapy cycles underwent second randomisation to receive continuous or intermittent docetaxel therapy. Six hundred patients were to be randomised to achieve 80% statistical power to demonstrate an NI hazard ratio (HR) of 1.25 of interruption versus maintenance of ADT.  Results:   The trial was prematurely closed when 198 participants were randomised. OS was similar in patients who continued (N = 96) versus those who interrupted (n = 102) ADT during docetaxel therapy (HR 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.72-1.33] and those on a continuous (N = 35) versus an intermittent (N = 42) docetaxel schedule (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.55-1.43). No difference in radiological progression-free survival, PSA response, or toxicity was observed between the study arms. The actual NI hazard margins of OS in Arms A and B patients were 1.33 and 1.43, respectively.  Conclusions:   This trial enrolled one-third of the planned patients; this main weakness dramatically limits the interpretation of the results. ADT discontinuation and switching to an intermittent schedule did not seem to affect docetaxel efficacy. The absence of testosterone recovery in the majority of patients could have been a contributory factor.

Six alterations were identified in the intronic regions of the LKB1 gene in both PCa and BPH. Five mutations were observed in both patient groups. A new alteration in intron 6 was observed in a patient with PCa. The LKB1 gene may be associated with benign transformations rather than the tumors in prostate pathogenesis when its expression and mutation status are considered.

Procedures:   The precursor PSMA-DFO (ABX) was used for Zr-89-labeling. This is not an antibody, but a peptide analogue of the precursor for the production of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. The ligand [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-DFO was compared with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]F-JK-PSMA-7 in vitro by determination of the Kd value, cellular uptake, internalization in LNCaP cells, biodistribution studies with LNCaP prostate tumor xenografts in mice, and in vivo by small-animal PET imaging in LNCaP tumor mouse models. A first-in-human PET was performed with [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-DFO on a patient presenting with a biochemical recurrence after brachytherapy and an ambiguous intraprostatic finding with [18F]F-JK-PSMA-7 but histologically benign cells in a prostate biopsy 7 months previously.  Results:   [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-DFO was prepared with a radiochemical purity ≥ 99.9% and a very high in vitro stability for up to 7 days at 37 °C. All radiotracers showed similar specific cellular binding and internalization, in vitro and comparable tumor uptake in biodistribution experiments during the first 5 h. The [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-DFO achieved significantly higher tumor/background ratios in LNCaP tumor xenografts (tumor/blood: 309 ± 89, tumor/muscle: 450 ± 38) after 24 h than [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 (tumor/blood: 112 ± 57, tumor/muscle: 58 ± 36) or [18F]F-JK-PSMA-7 (tumor/blood: 175 ± 30, tumor/muscle: 114 ± 14) after 4 h (p < 0.01). Small-animal PET imaging demonstrated in vivo that tumor visualization with [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-DFO is comparable to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 or [18F]F-JK-PSMA-7 at early time points (1 h p.i.) and that PET scans up to 48 h p.i. clearly visualized the tumor at late time points. A late [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-DFO PET scan on a patient with biochemical recurrence (BCR) had demonstrated intensive tracer accumulation in the right (SUVmax 13.25, 48 h p.i.) and in the left prostate lobe (SUV max 9.47), a repeat biopsy revealed cancer cells on both sides.

Pathologic objective response (pOR; ypT0-Ta-Tis-T1N0) and pathologic complete response (pCR; ypT0N0), as well survival outcomes were assessed. We used data of 395 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to investigate the prevalence of TCGA molecular subtypes and DNA damage repair (DDR) gene alterations according to patient age.  Results:   pOR was achieved in 40% of patients. There was no difference in distribution of pOR or pCR between age quartiles. On univariable logistic regression analysis, patient age was not associated with pOR or pCR when evaluated as continuous variables or stratified in quartiles (all p > 0.3). Median follow-up was 18 months (IQR 6-37). On Cox regression and competing risk regression analyses, age was not associated with survival outcomes (all p > 0.05). In the TCGA cohort, patient with age ≤ 60 years has 7% less DDR gene mutations (p = 0.59). We found higher age distribution in patients with luminal (p < 0.001) and luminal infiltrated (p = 0.002) compared to those with luminal papillary subtype.  Conclusions:   While younger patients may have less mutational tumor burden, our analysis failed to show an association of age with response to preoperative chemotherapy or survival outcomes.

A recent computational study involving the TCGA database of glioma patients found RUNX1T1 as one of the downregulated driver genes associated with poor overall survival of glioma patients. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) is upregulated in glioma and has been associated with the severity and drug resistance of glioma. Previously, we have shown that RUNX1T3 degrades HIF1α affecting the proliferation of leukemia cells. We hypothesize that RUNX1T1 might be associated with the growth and development of glioma through the regulation of HIF1α. We have evaluated the expression level of RUNX1T1 at different stages of glioma and the effect of RUNX1T1 on the proliferation and invasiveness of glioblastoma cells in vitro. We further looked at the effect of RUNX1T1 on the expression and stability of HIF1α in vitro. Expression of RUNX1T1 was significantly downregulated, both at RNA and protein levels in glioma samples as studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. While expression of HIF1α was higher in glioma tissues compared with its level in the normal brain. In vitro studies demonstrated that RUNX1T1 interacted with HIF1α and recruited HIF1α modification factor such as PHD2 and GSK3β causing hydroxylation of HIF1α following ubiquitination by FBW7. RUNX1T1 led to the degradation of HIF1α and decreased proliferation/invasiveness of glioblastoma cell lines. Further, RUNX1T1 increased the effectiveness of temozolomide (TMZ), a conventional glioma drug toward glioblastoma cell lines. This study indicates that downregulation of RUNX1T1 might play an important role in the severity and development of glioma.""","""['Parveen Kumar', 'Vivek Verma', 'Dheeraj Mohania', 'Surbhi Gupta', 'Avneet K Babbar', 'Bhawna Rathi', 'Rakesh S Dhanda', 'Manisha Yadav']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['RUNX1T1 function in cell fate.', 'The HIF‑1α/miR‑224‑3p/ATG5 axis affects cell mobility and chemosensitivity by regulating hypoxia‑induced protective autophagy in glioblastoma and astrocytoma.', 'The HIF1α/HIF2α-miR210-3p network regulates glioblastoma cell proliferation, dedifferentiation and chemoresistance through EGF under hypoxic conditions.', 'Downregulation of HIF-1a sensitizes U251 glioma cells to the temozolomide (TMZ) treatment.', 'Treatments against Polymorphosal discrepancies in Glioblastoma Multiforme.', 'RUNX Family in Hypoxic Microenvironment and Angiogenesis in Cancers.', 'RUNX1T1 function in cell fate.']"""

Even less is known about the influence of estradiol, despite its production from testosterone, and high receptor density in brain regions related to male sexual behavior.  Method:   We used eye-tracking to compare men's visual attention to images of fully clothed (i.e. neutral) and minimally clothed (i.e. sexy) models in three groups: androgen-deprived (n = 6) and not androgen-deprived with prostate cancer (n = 11), and healthy controls (n = 7). We also assessed effects of serum testosterone, estradiol, and sex hormone-binding globulin levels.  Results:   We found no group effect for fixations to sexy compared to neutral images, and no influence of testosterone on either total fixations, or proportion of fixations to sexy images. In contrast, we found that sex hormone binding globulin positively predicted total fixations, and estradiol positively predicted proportion of total fixations on sexy images--regardless of androgen treatment status.

Participants were evaluated pre- and post intervention with subjective mood and symptom questionnaires and objective neurocognitive tests.  Results:   One hundred twenty-eight participants (mean age 59 years), average 4.6 years (+ / - 5.5 years) post cancer treatment with various cancer types (breast, bladder, prostate, colon, uterine), were enrolled. Analysis of all participants who attended workshop(s) revealed improvement in the TX workshop completers on all objective cognitive measures (attention, concentration, declarative, and working memory) save one test of selective attention, and improvement on a single measure (verbal memory) and decline (selective attention) in the EC group. TX workshop completers also improved on all symptom and mood measures, in contrast to EC group which improved on a single subscale of a symptom measure, but increased on an anxiety measure. TX group alone improved on a quantified measure of each participants' unique, ""top three,"" self-described cognitive symptoms.

We demonstrate that ETV1 can be posttranslationally modified by covalent attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO1) onto four different lysine residues. In human embryonic kidney 293T cells, mutation of these sumoylation sites stimulated the transactivation potential of ETV1 at the matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), but not Yes-associated protein 1 gene promoter, while ETV1 protein stability and intracellular localization remained unchanged. In stark contrast, sumoylation-deficient ETV1 was repressed in its ability to stimulate the MMP1 promoter and to cooperate with a histone demethylase, JmjC domain-containing 2A (JMJD2A), in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Mutation of sumoylation sites enhanced the ability of ETV1 to interact with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1, but had basically no impact on complex formation with HDAC3 or JMJD2A. Further, compared to non-sumoylated ETV1, its sumoylated forms were less able to bind to the transcription factor, SMAD family member 4. Lastly, in contrast to wild-type ETV1, sumoylation-deficient ETV1 repressed LNCaP cell growth. Altogether, these data suggest that sumoylation modulates ETV1 function in a cell type-specific manner, possibly by altering the spectrum of transcriptional cofactors being recruited. Notably, SUMO pathway components SUMO1, ubiquitin-like modifier activating enzyme 2 and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 9 were upregulated in prostate tumors, implying that enhanced sumoylation indeed promotes ETV1's oncogenic activity during prostate cancer formation.""","""['Sangphil Oh', 'Sook Shin', 'Ralf Janknecht']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Clin Exp Pathol""","""['Cooperation between ETS transcription factor ETV1 and histone demethylase JMJD1A in colorectal cancer.', 'Upregulation of PSMD10 caused by the JMJD2A histone demethylase.', 'Histone demethylase JMJD2A drives prostate tumorigenesis through transcription factor ETV1.', 'SUMO1/sentrin/SMT3 specific peptidase 2 modulates target molecules and its corresponding functions.', 'The Ubiquitin-Like SUMO System and Heart Function: From Development to Disease.', 'Promotion of colorectal cancer by transcription factor BHLHE40 involves upregulation of ADAM19 and KLF7.', 'SUMOylation and NEDDylation in Primary and Metastatic Cancers to Bone.', 'Interaction of ncRNA and Epigenetic Modifications in Gastric Cancer: Focus on Histone Modification.']"""

The primary outcomes were: proportion of RT courses using SF-RT and ART. The Cochrane-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate the changing pattern of SF-RT and ART over time. Multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with the primary outcomes RESULTS: Of the 4,324 courses of palliative RT for BM, 767 (17.7%) were SF-RT, and 615 (14.2%) were ART. There was no evidence of change in SF-RT use over time (P-trend=0.13). In multivariate analyses, increasing age at RT, site of BM (rib, shoulder, pelvis, and extremities), patients' area of residence (regional and remote), and treatment in public and metropolitan centres were associated with increased likelihood of SF-RT use. There was marked increase in ART use from 0.2% in 2012 to 24% in 2017 (11% intensity modulated RT, 13% SBRT) (P-trend<0.001). In multivariate analyses, younger age at RT, site of BM (rib and pelvis), higher socioeconomic status, and treatment in private and metropolitan centres were associated with increased likelihood of ART use.  Conclusion:   SF-RT continues to be a clear minority of RT schedules employed in management of BM in PCa, and the adoption of SF-RT use should be encouraged in men with limited prognosis.

MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 218 patients with PSA levels <20 ng/mL and suspicious lesions according to the Prostate Imaging Recording and Data System version 2.0 (PI-RADS v2). All 218 men underwent transperineal MRI-TB, followed by template-guided 12-core systematic biopsy (SB). Of the 218 patients undergoing TB, 100 received MRI-ultrasound-assisted software fusion biopsy (FB) and 118 received cognitive biopsy (CB). Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as a Gleason score ≥3+4. RESULTS The overall TB positive rate was similar to that of SB (P=0.156), but with a higher diagnostic rate for csPCa (P=0.034). SB misdiagnosed csPCa in 11.47% of cases; TB misdiagnosed csPCa in 5.50% of cases. SB+TB detected more tumors with a Gleason score of 7 than did SB alone (43 vs 22). Detection rates of csPCa were similar for CB and FB (P=0.217). In total, 47 men had 2 MRI-determined suspicious areas. Of 265 suspicious areas, 143 (53.96%) had a PI-RADS v2 score of 3; 92 (34.71%) had a score of 4; and 30 (11.32%) had a score of 5. The positive detection rates for csPCa in patients with PI-RADS v2 scores of 3, 4, and 5, were 11.19%, 48.91%, and 80.00%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS TB increased the positive biopsy detection rate but missed some cases of csPCa.

It is a rare phenomenon in the natural history of any neoplasm, with approximately 100 cases reported in the literature to date. The lungs are the most frequent metastatic tumor donors and kidney cancer is the most common recipient. However, the opposite phenomenon (lung adenocarcinoma as a recipient of metastasis from renal carcinoma) has not been previously reported in the literature. CASE REPORT We present the case of a man with a history of multiple neoplasms. He had a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in 2006, a left papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) type 2 in 2006, and an acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 2011. A follow-up computed tomography scan in July 2019 showed a suspicious lung nodule on the left upper lobe and a retroperitoneal hypermetabolic mass on the positron emission tomography scan. The lung nodule and retroperitoneal mass biopsies were consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma with a lepidic pattern and a metastatic RCC, respectively. In January 2020, he underwent a thoracoscopic left upper lobectomy and a mediastinal lymph node dissection. Histopathological evaluation revealed a 2-cm nodule composed of a lung adenocarcinoma with an intratumoral metastasis from a papillary RCC. To date, the patient has stable renal neoplastic metastatic disease and no locoregional recurrences of the lung adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS Metastasis from one primary tumor to another primary tumor is an extremely unusual event.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 121 patients who underwent prebiopsy MRI and prostate biopsy. More than five radiologists (Reader groups 1, 2: residents; Readers 3, 4: less-experienced radiologists; Reader 5: expert) independently reviewed biparametric MRI (bpMRI). The DLA results were obtained using bpMRI. The reference standard was based on pathologic reports. The diagnostic performance of the PI-RADS classification of DLA, clinical reports, and radiologists was analyzed using AUROC. Dichotomous analysis (PI-RADS cutoff value ≥ 3 or 4) was performed, and the sensitivities and specificities were compared using McNemar's test.  Results:   Clinically significant cancer [CSC, Gleason score ≥ 7] was confirmed in 43 patients (35.5%). The AUROC of the DLA (0.828) for diagnosing CSC was significantly higher than that of Reader 1 (AUROC, 0.706; p = 0.011), significantly lower than that of Reader 5 (AUROC, 0.914; p = 0.013), and similar to clinical reports and other readers (p = 0.060-0.661). The sensitivity of DLA (76.7%) was comparable to those of all readers and the clinical reports at a PI-RADS cutoff value ≥ 4. The specificity of the DLA (85.9%) was significantly higher than those of clinical reports and Readers 2-3 and comparable to all others at a PI-RADS cutoff value ≥ 4.

Patients and methods:   A total of 224 patients underwent LDR brachytherapy with HSP, as monotherapy or combined with EBRT, between January 2016 and December 2019. Dosimetric variables reflecting the extent of rectal sparing and late rectal toxicity outcomes were evaluated.

Results:   Hydrogel spacer placement was associated with significantly reduced rectal doses for all dosimetric variables; the median percentage rectal dose to 1 cc of rectum and rectal dose to 2 cc of rectum of the spacer cohort were all significantly lower compared to the non-spacer cohort. The incidence rates of overall (any grade) and grade ≥2 rectal toxicity were lower in patients with HSP compared to patients who did not undergo HSP: 12% and 1.8% vs 31% and 5.8%, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidence of overall rectal toxicity was significantly lower with HSP than without (15% vs 33%; P < 0.001), corresponding to an overall rectal toxicity reduction on univariable analysis (hazard ratio 0.45, 95% confidence interval 0.28-0.73; P = 0.001). In this patient cohort treated with prostate brachytherapy, none of the urethral dosimetric variables or the presence or absence of HSP was associated with late urinary toxicity.

However, there is no relevant information on the regulation of PCa by circFOXM1. The RNA level of circFOXM1 was detected by qRT-PCR in PCa tissues and cells. The protein expression was performed by western blot and immunohistochemistry assay. Cell proliferation was examined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide, colony formation and flow cytometry assays. The abilities of cell migration and invasion were determined by transwell assay. The relationship between circFOXM1 and miR-515-5p or ADAM10 was predicted by starBaseV2.0 online database, and identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay or RNA pull-down assay. The effects of circFOXM1 silencing and ADAM10 knockdown on PCa growth in vivo were evaluated by in-vivo tumor formation assay. As a result, we found that circFOXM1 and ADAM10 expression were upregulated in PCa tissues and cells. Functional analysis showed that circFOXM1 silencing repressed proliferation, migration and invasion, and induced cell cycle arrest, whereas these effects were partly reversed by miR-515-5p inhibitor. Additionally, circFOXM1 directly sponged miR-515-5p, and miR-515-5p bound to ADAM10. ADAM10 absence also repressed PCa process. Furthermore, in-vivo tumor formation assay revealed that both circFOXM1 silencing and ADAM10 knockdown repressed tumor growth in vivo. Thus, we came a conclusion that circFOXM1 contributed to PCa progression via regulating miR-515-5p/ADAM10 axis.

However, the mechanisms underlying the anticancer activity of dihydroartemisinin are not fully understood. Ubiquitin-like with plant homeodomain and ring finger domain 1 (UHRF1) is highly expressed in a variety of tumors and is negatively correlated with the prognosis of various tumors. We reported previously that UHRF1 is downregulated during apoptosis induced by dihydroartemisinin in PC-3 PCa cells. In this study, we transfected PC-3 cells with lentiviruses containing UHRF1 or shRNA-UHRF1. Then, the cells were treated with dihydroartemisinin at different concentrations. Our data showed that overexpression of UHRF1 promoted cell proliferation and migration in PC-3 cells, inhibited cell apoptosis, increased cell proportion in G2 phase, increased DNA methyltransferase 1 and decreased p16INK4A expression at mRNA and protein levels. Downregulation of UHRF1 produces the opposite results. Moreover, the phenomena caused by overexpression of UHRF1 were inhibited after dihydroartemisinin treatment. Compared with control cells, cells overexpressing UHRF1 can resist the proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects of dihydroartemisinin to a certain extent. The effects of UHRF1 knockdown were further aggravated by dihydroartemisinin treatment, but no statistically significant effect was observed with increasing drug concentration. Our results suggested that dihydroartemisinin decreases proliferation and migration but enhances apoptosis of PCa cells, likely by downregulating UHRF1 and upregulating p16INK4A.""","""['Tong Xia', 'Sihao Liu', 'Ge Xu', 'Siji Zhou', 'Ziguo Luo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Effect of dihydroartemisinin on UHRF1 gene expression in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.', 'UHRF1 overexpression is involved in cell proliferation and biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Silencing UHRF1 Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Promotes Cell Apoptosis in Retinoblastoma Via the PI3K/Akt Signalling Pathway.', 'Down-regulation of UHRF1, associated with re-expression of tumor suppressor genes, is a common feature of natural compounds exhibiting anti-cancer properties.', 'Thymoquinone Is a Multitarget Single Epidrug That Inhibits the UHRF1 Protein Complex.', 'Integrated bioinformatics analysis of potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 10,299 patients who underwent prostate biopsy by 50 operators under a unified urology residency program. The number of prostate biopsies performed by an operator for each patient was used as an indicator of operator experience. Residents were grouped into quartiles according to cancer detection rates in the first 50 and the last 50 procedures.  Results:   Among 10,299 patients (median age, 67.5 years; median prostate-specific antigen [PSA], 7.04 ng/mL), the overall prostate cancer detection rate and that for patients with PSA <10.0 ng/mL were 37.0% and 25.9%, respectively. Operator experience was a significant predictor for cancer detection in patients with PSA <10.0 ng/mL. Cancer detection rates and the proportion of more advanced prostate cancers were higher in the last 50 cases than in the first 50 cases. Detection rates varied significantly among operator; residents with higher detection rates at training initiation showed even higher detection rates after additional training.  Conclusions:   Training that adds to the cumulative experience of a trainee appears to play a meaningful role in improving cancer detection rates. The level of skill required to achieve mastery for independent practice may be assessed from the accuracy results of prostate biopsy procedures, and trainees with poor rates will require more technical training to improve precision.""","""['Dongu Lee', 'Byung Ha Chung', 'Kwang Suk Lee']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Impact of training level of urology residents on the detection of prostate cancer on TRUS biopsy.', 'The learning curve of transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: implications for training programs.', 'Gleason underestimation is predicted by prostate biopsy core length.', 'Prostate biopsy: who, how and when.

Results:   Of the 1,110 study subjects, 883 underwent RARP and 227 RT from 2007 to 2016. The differences between groups including the age (≥80 y; 25.4% vs. 32.8%; p=0.034), concomitant diabetes (14.9% vs. 22.9%; p=0.007), coronary heart disease (3.5% vs. 7.5%; p=0.015), and PCa risk stratification (high-risk; 18.2% vs. 59.7%; p<0.001) were balanced after IPTW. During a mean follow-up of 74.5 months, OSs (91.9% vs. 91.0%) and CSSs (97.8% vs. 98.0%) were similar. After IPTW, overall mortality was associated with diabetes (hazard ratio [HR], 2.273; p<0.0001) and inversely with low-risk PCa (HR, 0.314; p<0.0001), the last of which was solely associated with cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.245; p=0.0005). The implementation of local treatment between RARP and RT demonstrated no impact on survival, for whole and high-risk populations.  Conclusions:   Even aged over 75 years, patients who underwent RARP for non-metastatic PCa had similar survival with RT regardless of risk stratification.

This study evaluated the association between the pretreatment albumin to globulin ratio (AGR) and clinicopathologic characteristics of nonmetastatic PCa in a large multicenter setting in Korea.  Materials and methods:   This study involved 742 patients with nonmetastatic PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) in seven institutions between January 2011 and December 2012. The AGR was calculated as follows: albumin/(total protein-albumin). Patients were divided into low and high AGR groups by a cutoff value from a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.  Results:   The best cutoff for the AGR was set at 1.53. The area under the curve of the AGR was 0.624 (95% confidence interval, 0.557-0.671; p<0.001). Patients who had a lower pretreatment AGR (<1.53) were identified as the low AGR group (n=398, 53.6%) and the remaining patients as the high AGR group (n=344, 46.4%). Preoperative AGR was significantly lower in patients with non-organ-confined disease (≥pT3) than in those with organ-confined disease (≤pT2) (p<0.001). The low AGR group had higher aggressive pathologic Gleason scores (pGS) (≥8) than did the high AGR group (p=0.016). Furthermore, the AGR was an independent prognostic factor for high pGS (≥8) and non-organ-confined disease (≥pT3), according to multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Conclusions:   A low AGR was closely associated with nonconfined disease (≥pT3) and high pGS (≥8).

This study assessed prevalence trends for mCRPC over eight years in a large managed care population.  Methods:   In a claims database, adult male patients were included with ≥ 1 claim for prostate cancer, pharmacologic/surgical castration, and metastatic disease during the identification period. The index mCRPC date was the first metastatic claim; six months of continuous enrollment before and after was required. Patients with metastatic disease at baseline were excluded. Patients were followed until death, end of study, or disenrollment, whichever was earliest. Total, mCRPC per-prostate cancer, and age-specific prevalence rates were calculated cross-sectionally for each year under study (2010-2017).  Results:   Of 343,089 patients identified with a claim for prostate cancer, 3690 mCRPC cases (1.1%) were identified. Incidence (new cases per year) remained relatively constant over the study period while prevalence of mCRPC (total cases per year) increased. mCRPC prevalence increased with increasing age. Total and mCRPC per-prostate cancer prevalence rates increased in monotonic, year-over-year trends from 2010 to 2017, while incidence (new cases per year) of mCRPC remained relatively stable.  Conclusion:   This study found increasing prevalence of mCRPC in an insured patient population during the 8-year period, coupled with stable incidence, validating that patients with the disease are living longer.

However, specific primary tumour features might impact accuracy of PSMA-PET for PCa detection. We investigated histopathological parameters and immunohistochemical PSMA expression patterns on radical prostatectomy (RPE) specimens and correlated them to the corresponding 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET examinations.  Methods:   RPE specimens of 62 patients with preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET between 2016 and 2018 were analysed. WHO/ISUP grade groups, growth pattern (expansive vs. infiltrative), tumour area and diameter as well as immunohistochemical PSMA heterogeneity, intensity and negative tumour area (PSMA%neg) were correlated with spatially corresponding SUVmax on 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET in a multidisciplinary analysis.  Results:   All tumours showed medium to strong membranous (2-3 +) and weak to strong cytoplasmic (1-3 +) PSMA expression. Heterogeneously expressed PSMA was found in 38 cases (61%). Twenty-five cases (40%) showed at least 5% and up to 80% PSMA%neg. PSMA%neg, infiltrative growth pattern, smaller tumour area and diameter and WHO/ISUP grade group 2 significantly correlated with lower SUVmax values. A ROC curve analysis revealed 20% PSMA%neg as an optimal cutoff with the highest sensitivity and specificity (89% and 86%, AUC 0.923) for a negative PSMA-PET scan. A multiple logistic regression model revealed tumoural PSMA%neg (p < 0.01, OR = 9.629) and growth pattern (p = 0.0497, OR = 306.537) as significant predictors for a negative PSMA-PET scan.  Conclusions:   We describe PSMA%neg, infiltrative growth pattern, smaller tumour size and WHO/ISUP grade group 2 as parameters associated with a lower 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in prostate cancer.

Objectives:   We hypothesized that dietary lyophilized tomato paste (TP) would reduce apoptosis within carotenoid-containing nonneoplastic tissues in EBRT-treated TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mice.  Methods:   Male TRAMP mice (n = 73) were provided an AIN-93G diet or a modified AIN-93G diet containing 10% TP (wt:wt) at 4 wk of age. Prostate tumor growth was monitored by ultrasound. The caudal half of the mouse was irradiated with 7.5 Gy (Rad) or 0 Gy (sham) at 24 wk of age or after the tumor volume exceeded 1000 mm3 with a Cobalt-60 source. Mice were euthanized 24 h postradiation. Carotenoids and α-tocopherol were measured by HPLC and compared by a t test. Tissues were assessed for radiation-induced changes (hematoxylin and eosin) and apoptosis [cleaved caspase-3 (CC3)] and compared by Kruskal-Wallis test or Freedman-Lane's permutation test.  Results:   Serum concentrations of lycopene (52% lower), phytoene (26% lower), and α-tocopherol (22% lower) were decreased in TP-fed irradiated mice (TP-Rad) compared with TP-fed sham mice (P < 0.05). CC3 scores increased within the prostate tumor with radiation treatments (P < 0.05), but were not affected by tomato consumption. In nonneoplastic tissues, TP-Rad had a lower percentage of CC3-positive cells within the cranial (67% lower) and caudal (75% lower) duodenum than irradiated mice on the control diet (Rad) (P < 0.005). Likewise, CC3 scores within the dorsolateral prostate of TP-Rad trended toward lower scores than for Rad (P = 0.07).

Methods: The biodistribution of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 on PET/CT scans obtained with a high specific activity (median, 178.9 MBq/µg; n = 42) and a low specific activity (median, 19.3 MBq/µg; n = 42) was compared. Results: Tracer uptake by the parotid gland, submandibular gland, and spleen was moderately but significantly lower in the low-specific-activity group than in the high-specific-activity group (median SUVmean, 16.7 vs. 19.2; 18.1 vs. 22.3; and 7.8 vs. 9.6, respectively). No other statistically significant differences were found for normal organs or tumor lesions. Conclusion: A 10-fold decrease in specific activity has only minor effects on the biodistribution of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3.

However, the low image resolution and significant background noise can result in poor correlation, even errors, between radiotracer distribution, anatomic structure, and molecular expression profiles. Differing from conventional optical systems, the point-spread function in DAR is determined by properties of radioisotope decay, phosphor, and digitizer. Calibration of an experimental point-spread function a priori is difficult, prone to error, and impractical. We have developed a content-adaptive restoration algorithm to address these problems. Methods: We model the DAR imaging process using a mixed Poisson-gaussian model and blindly restore the image by a penalized maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization algorithm (PG-PEM). PG-PEM implements a patch-based estimation algorithm with density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise to estimate noise parameters and uses L2 and Hessian Frebonius norms as regularization functions to improve performance. Results: First, PG-PEM outperformed other restoration algorithms at the denoising task (P < 0.01). Next, we implemented PG-PEM on preclinical DAR images (18F-FDG, treated mouse tumor and heart; 18F-NaF, treated mouse femur) and clinical DAR images (bone biopsy sections from 223RaCl2-treated castration-resistant prostate cancer patients). DAR images restored by PG-PEM of all samples achieved a significantly higher effective resolution and contrast-to-noise ratio and a lower SD of background (P < 0.0001). Additionally, by comparing the registration results between the clinical DAR images and the segmented bone masks from the corresponding histologic images, we found that the radiopharmaceutical distribution was significantly improved (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: PG-PEM is able to increase resolution and contrast while robustly accounting for DAR noise and demonstrates the capacity to be widely implemented to improve preclinical and clinical DAR imaging of radiopharmaceutical distribution.""","""['Lu Peng', 'Benabdallah Nadia', 'Jiang Wen', 'Brian W Simons', 'Zhang Hanwen', 'Robert F Hobbs', 'Ulmert David', 'Brian C Baumann', 'Russell K Pachynski', 'Abhinav K Jha', 'Daniel L J Thorek']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Image deconvolution in digital autoradiography: a preliminary study.', 'Quantitative and Qualitative Improvement of Low-Count 68GaCitrate and 90YMicrospheres PET Image Reconstructions Using Block Sequential Regularized Expectation Maximization Algorithm.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Evaluation of Penalized-Likelihood Estimation Reconstruction on a Digital Time-of-Flight PET/CT Scanner for 18F-FDG Whole-Body Examinations.', 'Variability and uncertainty of 18F-FDG PET imaging protocols for assessing inflammation in atherosclerosis: suggestions for improvement.', 'IMC-Denoise: a content aware denoising pipeline to enhance Imaging Mass Cytometry.']"""

In the absence of overt metastases, patients with non-metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (nmCSPC) often receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). There is no standard-of-care consensus on optimal ADT timing, although most men are treated prior to metastases, especially those with high-risk features (Gleason score 8-10 or prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) <9-12 months). Given data that ADT plus novel hormonal agents improve survival in men with metastatic CSPC, there is a desire to evaluate these agents earlier in the disease course. The main objective of EMBARK is the comparative assessment of enzalutamide plus leuprolide (luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa)) or enzalutamide monotherapy versus monotherapy LHRHa to improve metastasis-free survival (MFS) in patients with high-risk nmCSPC PSA recurrence after definitive therapy.  Methods and analysis:   EMBARK is a randomised, phase 3 study of high-risk patients with nmCSPC, a PSADT of ≤9 months and a screening PSA of ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir after radiotherapy (RT) or ≥1 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without postoperative RT. Men (n=1050) are randomised 1:1:1 to enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus LHRHa or placebo plus LHRHa (double-blind arms) or enzalutamide monotherapy (open-label arm). Treatment is suspended at week 37 if PSA concentrations are <0.2 ng/mL and reinstated if levels rise to ≥2.0 ng/mL with RP or ≥5.0 ng/mL without RP. Patients with PSA ≥0.2 ng/mL at week 37 continue until treatment discontinuation criteria are met. The primary endpoint is MFS comparing enzalutamide plus LHRHa versus placebo plus LHRHa.

Methods:   In order to determine the most suitable dark matrix composition for the quantification of such samples using the Fundamental Parameter approach, we have measured several Certified Reference Materials and essayed different dark matrix compositions to achieve the most accurate results. The resulting dark matrix was then applied to normal and tumor ovarian and prostate tissue samples, and the obtained results were compared with the ones obtained with a comparative method using external standard calibration curves.  Results:   Using a dark matrix composed of 10 % - H, 22 % - C, 3 % - N and 60 % - O yielded the best compromise in accuracy for the light and heavy elements. For the reduced sample size and conditions of this study, for both organs, the concentrations of transition metals decrease in tumor tissues, while the concentration of lighter elements, P and Cl, increases. On the other hand, there are elements that showed different behavior between the two types of tissue, namely Zn and S, that increase in prostate tumor tissue and decrease in ovarian tissue.

The cut and ""touch"" monopolar cautery technique has been suggested to reduce desiccating thermal injury caused by bipolar energy when vessels are sealed.  Objective:   To compare potency outcomes between an athermal technique (AT) and touch cautery (TC) to transect the prostatic vascular pedicles (PVPs) and dissect the NVBs.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective concomitant nonrandomized study of AT versus TC was performed in 733 men. A total of 323 undergoing AT had ""thin"" pedicles, easily suitable for suture ligation. TC was based on ""thick"" pedicles (n = 230) difficult to suture ligate. Men were excluded for an International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score of <15 or adjuvant therapies (n = 180).  Surgical procedure:   Single-surgeon RARP.  Measurements:   Patient-reported outcomes with erectile function (EF) recovery defined as two affirmative answers to erections sufficient for intercourse (ESI; ""are erections firm enough for penetration?"" and ""are the erections satisfactory?""), IIEF-5 scores 15-25, and a novel percent fullness score comparing pre- versus postoperative erection fullness. Logistic regression models assessed the correlation between cautery technique, covariates, and EF recovery.  Results and limitations:   In an unadjusted analysis, preoperative IIEF-5, age, body mass index (BMI), and prostate weight were significant predictors of potency recovery. Follow-up was similar (AT 52.7 mo vs TC 54.6 mo, p = 0.534). In logistic regression, preoperative IIEF-5, age, and BMI were significant predictors of EF recovery, defined as IIEF-5 scores 15-25, ESI, and percent fullness >75%. Results were similar when IIEF-5 and percent fullness were assessed continuously.  Conclusions:   During transection of the PVPs and dissection of the NVBs, TC did not impact EF recovery significantly, compared with an AT.

Methods:   Fifty men (mean age 71.8) were imaged with [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18F]PSMA-1007 < 4 weeks apart. Images were independently reported according to TNM by two experienced nuclear medicine specialists blinded to the other scan and prior imaging. Discordant results were resolved by a third independent nuclear medicine specialist. Quantitative analysis of lesion uptake and physiologic tissue for each tracer was performed by one experienced reader.  Results:   Scan indications were initial staging (n = 12), biochemical recurrence (n = 27) and metastatic disease evaluation (n = 11). Most patients had ISUP grade group 3 or higher. Median PSA value was 2.7 ng/ml (IQR 0.7-12.0), and a minority of patients (28%) were currently treated with androgen deprivation therapy. [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake was significantly higher than [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in local recurrence, nodal and distant metastases and most physiologic sites (including bone) except for urinary bladder which was significantly lower.

This study provides insight into both hallmarks by uncovering a novel link between AR and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Specifically, we identify 6-phosphogluoconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) as an androgen-regulated gene that is upregulated in prostate cancer. AR increased the expression of 6PGD indirectly via activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Accordingly, loss of 6PGD, AR or SREBP1 resulted in suppression of PPP activity as revealed by 1,2-13C2 glucose metabolic flux analysis. Knockdown of 6PGD also impaired growth and elicited death of prostate cancer cells, at least in part due to increased oxidative stress. We investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting 6PGD using two specific inhibitors, physcion and S3, and observed substantial anti-cancer activity in multiple models of prostate cancer, including aggressive, therapy-resistant models of castration-resistant disease as well as prospectively collected patient-derived tumour explants. Targeting of 6PGD was associated with two important tumour-suppressive mechanisms: first, increased activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which repressed anabolic growth-promoting pathways regulated by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1); and second, enhanced AR ubiquitylation, associated with a reduction in AR protein levels and activity. Supporting the biological relevance of positive feedback between AR and 6PGD, pharmacological co-targeting of both factors was more effective in suppressing the growth of prostate cancer cells than single-agent therapies. Collectively, this work provides new insight into the dysregulated metabolism of prostate cancer and provides impetus for further investigation of co-targeting AR and the PPP as a novel therapeutic strategy.""","""['Joanna L Gillis', 'Josephine A Hinneh', 'Natalie K Ryan', 'Swati Irani', 'Max Moldovan', 'Lake-Ee Quek', 'Raj K Shrestha', 'Adrienne R Hanson', 'Jianling Xie', 'Andrew J Hoy', 'Jeff Holst', 'Margaret M Centenera', 'Ian G Mills', 'David J Lynn', 'Luke A Selth', 'Lisa M Butler']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Elife""","""['6PGD inhibition sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma to chemotherapy via AMPK activation and metabolic reprogramming.', 'Dual targeting of androgen receptor and mTORC1 by salinomycin in prostate cancer.', '6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase links oxidative PPP, lipogenesis and tumour growth by inhibiting LKB1-AMPK signalling.', 'SREBF1 Activity Is Regulated by an AR/mTOR Nuclear Axis in Prostate Cancer.', '6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase fuels multiple aspects of cancer cells: From cancer initiation to metastasis and chemoresistance.', 'Critical role of antioxidant programs in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor signaling-mitochondrial DNA-oxidative phosphorylation: A critical triangle in early prostate cancer.', 'Quantitative proteomics identified circulating biomarkers in lung adenocarcinoma diagnosis.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Spindle pole body component 25 in the androgen-induced regression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Hematological and neurological expressed 1 (HN1) also known as Jupiter Microtubule Associated Homolog 1 (JPT1) belongs to a small poorly understood family of genes that are evolutionarily conserved across vertebrate species. The co-expression network of HN1 from the TCGA PRAD dataset indicates the putative role of HN1 in centrosome-related processes in the context of prostate cancer. HN1 expression is low in normal RWPE-1 cells as compared to cancerous androgen-responsive LNCaP and androgen insensitive PC-3 cells. HN1 overexpression resulted in differential response for cell proliferation and cell cycle changes in RWPE-1, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells. Since HN1 overexpression increased the proliferation rate in PC-3 cells, these cells were used for functional characterization of HN1 in advanced prostate carcinogenesis. Furthermore, alterations in HN expression led to an increase in abnormal to normal nuclei ratio and increased chromosomal aberrations in PC-3 cells. We observed the co-localization of HN1 with γ-tubulin foci in prostate cancer cells, further validated by immunoprecipitation. HN1 was observed as physically associated with γ-tubulin and its depletion led to increased γ-tubulin foci and disruption in microtubule spindle assembly. Higher HN1 expression was correlated with prostate cancer as compared to normal tissues. The restoration of HN1 expression after silencing suggested that it has a role in centrosome clustering, implicating a potential role of HN1 in cell division as well as in prostate carcinogenesis warranting further studies.""","""['Lokman Varisli', 'Aadil Javed', 'Bilge Esin Ozturk', 'Gencer Kaan Akyuz', 'Gulevin Takir', 'Fani-Marlen Roumelioti', 'Sarantis Gagos', 'Kutsal Yorukoglu', 'Kemal Sami Korkmaz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Aurora A site specific TACC3 phosphorylation regulates astral microtubule assembly by stabilizing γ-tubulin ring complex.', 'TACC3 protein regulates microtubule nucleation by affecting γ-tubulin ring complexes.', 'Mitosis-specific anchoring of gamma tubulin complexes by pericentrin controls spindle organization and mitotic entry.', 'gamma-tubulin complexes: binding to the centrosome, regulation and microtubule nucleation.', 'Regulation of microtubule nucleation mediated by γ-tubulin complexes.', 'HN1 Is Enriched in the S-Phase, Phosphorylated in Mitosis, and Contributes to Cyclin B1 Degradation in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'HN1L/AP-2γ/PLK1 signaling drives tumor progression and chemotherapy resistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Several small molecules of PSMA ligands of inhibitors binding to the active site of PSMA were developed. [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-T4 is a new radiopharmaceutical (Polatom) for imaging loco-regional metastases and/or local relapse in patients with prostate cancer. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the clinical application of SPECT-CT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-T4 in patients with recurrent prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   Thirty-six patients with prostate cancer, aged 60-80 years with biochemical relapse of PSA (ranged from 0.1 to 73 ng/mL) were included. Three patients were studied after tru-cut biopsy, hormonal and cytoreductive radiotherapy and 33 patients out of 36 - after radical treatment (total prostatectomy or definitive radiotherapy of the tumour). All of them underwent whole-body imaging examinations with subsequent target SPECT-CT studies of the pelvis, abdomen and/or chest, 1-3 hrs post i.v. administration of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-T4. The average activity dose was 6.3 MBq/kg in a man of 70 kg. A Dual-head SPECT-CT gamma camera with a low dose CT scan (Symbia T2, Siemens) was used. The images were interpreted based on all other clinical and radiological data. Follow-up could be conducted in 11/36 patients during that period.  Results:   Normal biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical with high activity background was observed in the liver, spleen, kidneys, lacrimal and salivary glands, bowels and urinary bladder. Positive imaging for local relapse in the prostate bad was imaged in 21 patients, lymph node metastases - in 16 cases, bone lesions - in 10 cases, pulmonary metastases - in 2 cases, hepatic lesions were visualised in one of them and in another - adrenal suprarenal metastasis with intensive tracer uptake significant for overexpression of PSMA. There was a suspicion for local recurrences in 4 patients with negative MRT studies who were followed up. In 3 cases, previously treated bone metastases were partially negative without tracer uptake, only some progressive bone lesions were positive. Five patients were with negative results. Sensitivity was 84.37% (27/32), specificity - 100% (4/4) and accuracy - 86.11% (31/36).  Conclusions:   In conclusion SPECT-CT imaging with [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-T4 could be applied in patients with prostate cancer for the diagnosis of recurrent disease to determine personalized treatment for each patient. Specific uptake of this tracer, depicted by SPECT-CT images has clinical importance of identifying and assessing PSMA expression before consideration of Radio Ligand Therapy (RLT) with [¹⁷⁷Lu]Lu-PSMA. SPECT-CT imaging with [99mTc]PSMA is promising and reliable nuclear medicine approach to monitoring therapeutic effect after treatment and for restaging of the disease.""","""['Sonya Sergieva', 'Radoslav Mangaldgiev', 'Milena Dimcheva', 'Kamen Nedev', 'Zahary Zahariev', 'Bozhil Robev']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nucl Med Rev Cent East Eur""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'An Australian experience using Tc-PSMA SPECT/CT in the primary diagnosis of prostate cancer and for staging at biochemical recurrence after local therapy.', '99m Tc-MIP-1404-SPECT/CT for the detection of PSMA-positive lesions in 225 patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'ProstaScint scan may enhance identification of prostate cancer recurrences after prostatectomy, radiation, or hormone therapy: analysis of 136 scans of 100 patients.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Diagnostic performance of 99mTc-HYNIC-PSMA SPECT/CT for biochemically recurrent prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'A Review on the Current State and Future Perspectives of 99mTcTc-Housed PSMA-i in Prostate Cancer.', 'Initial Experience of Clinical Use of 99mTcTc-PSMA-T4 in Patients with Prostate Cancer.

A decline in the number of new cancers being diagnosed over a relatively short term implies a delay in diagnosis and subsequent treatment. This delay is expected to have a negative effect on cancerrelated morbidity and mortality. The impact of the pandemic on the number of new cancer diagnoses in our setting is unknown.  Objectives:   To assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of new cancers diagnosed at our institution in the first 3 months following the implementation of lockdown restrictions, by focusing on common non-cutaneous cancers.  Methods:   A retrospective laboratory-based audit was performed at a large anatomical pathology laboratory in Western Cape Province, South Africa. The numbers of new diagnoses for six common cancers (breast, prostate, cervix, large bowel, oesophagus and stomach) from 1 April 2020 to 30 June 2020 were compared with the corresponding period in 2019.  Results:   Histopathological diagnoses for the six cancers combined decreased by 192 (-36.2%), from 531 new cases in the 2019 study period to 339 in the corresponding period in 2020. Substantial declines were seen for prostate (-58.2%), oesophageal (-44.1%), breast (-32.9%), gastric (-32.6%) and colorectal cancer (-29.2%). The smallest decline was seen in cervical cancer (-7%). New breast cancers diagnosed by cytopathology declined by 61.1%.  Conclusions:   The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated response resulted in a substantial decline in the number of new cancer diagnoses, implying a delay in diagnosis.

Our objective was to assess the efficacy and toxicity of multiple rechallenges.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified 22 mCRPC patients previously treated with docetaxel and/or androgen receptor-targeted agents who received multiple cabazitaxel rechallenges in 9 French centers. Cabazitaxel was initiated at a dose of 25 mg/m2 q3week. A reduced dose (20 mg/m2 q3w) or an alternative schedule (mainly 16 mg/m2 q2w) was increasingly used for subsequent rechallenges. Progression-free survival, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, best clinical response, and grade ≥3 toxicities were collected. Overall survival was calculated from various time points.  Results:   Twenty-two patients with an initial response to cabazitaxel were rechallenged at least twice. The median number of cabazitaxel cycles was 7 at first cabazitaxel treatment, 6 at first rechallenge, and 5 at subsequent rechallenges. Median progression-free survival at first rechallenge was 9.6 months and 5.6 months at second rechallenge. Median overall survival was 50.9 months from the first cabazitaxel dose, 114.9 months from first life-extending therapy initiation in mCRPC, and 105 months from mCRPC diagnosis. There was no cumulative grade ≥3 neuropathy or nail disorder and one case of febrile neutropenia.  Conclusion:   Cabazitaxel multiple rechallenges may be a treatment option without cumulative toxicity in heavily pretreated patients having a good response to first cabazitaxel use and still fit to receive it.

However, most patients eventually acquire resistance to this agent, and the underlying mechanisms related to this resistance remain largely unelucidated. Lysine acetyltransferase 2 A (KAT2A) has been reported to enhance transcriptional activity for certain histone or non-histone proteins through the acetylation and post-translational modification of the androgen receptor (AR). Therefore, we hypothesised that KAT2A might play a critical role in the resistance of prostate tumours to hormonal treatment. In this study, we found that KAT2A expression was increased in abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer C4-2 cells (C4-2-AbiR). Consistently, elevated expression of KAT2A was observed in patients with prostate cancer exhibiting high-grade disease or biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy, as well as in those with poor clinical survival outcomes. Moreover, KAT2A knockdown partially re-sensitised C4-2-AbiR cells to abiraterone, whereas KAT2A overexpression promoted abiraterone resistance in parental C4-2 cells. Consistent with this finding, KAT2A knockdown rescued abiraterone sensitivity and inhibited the proliferation of C4-2-AbiR cells in a mouse model. Mechanistically, KAT2A directly acetylated the hinge region of the AR, and induced AR translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in increased transcriptional activity of the AR-targeted gene prostate specific antigen (PSA) leading to resistance to the inhibitory effect of abiraterone on proliferation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a substantial role for KAT2A in the regulation of post-translational modifications in AR affecting CRPC development, suggesting that targeting KAT2A might be a potential strategy for CRPC treatment.""","""['Dingheng Lu#', 'Yarong Song#', 'Ying Yu#', 'Decai Wang', 'Bing Liu', 'Liang Chen', 'Xuexiang Li', 'Yunxue Li', 'Lulin Cheng', 'Fang Lv', 'Pu Zhang', 'Yifei Xing']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Niclosamide enhances abiraterone treatment via inhibition of androgen receptor variants in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.', 'ErbB2 Signaling Increases Androgen Receptor Expression in Abiraterone-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Aberrant KAT2A accumulations render TRIM22-low melanoma sensitive to Notch1 inhibitors via epigenetic reprogramming.', 'Histone H2A Lys130 acetylation epigenetically regulates androgen production in prostate cancer.', 'KAT2A Promotes the Succinylation of PKM2 to Inhibit its Activity and Accelerate Glycolysis of Gastric Cancer.', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.']"""

Objective:   The aim of this study was to emphasize the utility of routine biopsy during kyphoplasty and to report on a unique case of a patient with known history of prostate cancer found to have a new metastatic cancer.  Summary of background data:   Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) may cause debilitating pain with nearly one-third of them leading to chronic pain resulting in a tremendous impact on quality of life in patients. Kyphoplasty has been established as an effective means of surgical treatment. However, routine biopsy during kyphoplasty is presently not the standard of care under the presumption that most VCFs are caused by osteoporosis. The role of biopsy in the setting of known malignancy with multiple other risk factors for VCFs is not well understood.  Methods:   We report on a case of a 73-year-old male with known prostate cancer presenting with persistent unremitting low back pain failing conservative management. Patient develops multiple VCFs in the course of 6 months and is treated with multiple kyphoplasties. Routine biopsy at each level is negative until the last kyphoplasty results positive for malignancy. Surprisingly, the pathology is positive for malignancy other than the patient's known prostate cancer.  Results:   Pathology results prompt oncology workup on the patient which reveals multiple metastases and a new diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of possible upper gastrointestinal origin. In addition, patient's known prostate cancer is also noted to be active. Patient is subsequently started on chemotherapy.  Conclusion:   We highlight the utility of routine biopsy during kyphoplasty especially in patients with known history of malignancy. We emphasize that presumptions about the etiology of a VCF are difficult to make with multiple risk factors and that routine biopsy prevents incorrect presumptions such as in this case.Level of Evidence: 5.""","""['Muhammad B Tariq', 'Richard Obedian']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Spine (Phila Pa 1976)""","""['Balloon kyphoplasty: an evidence-based analysis.', 'Utility of routine biopsy at vertebroplasty in the management of vertebral compression fractures: a tertiary center experience.', 'Percutaneous vertebral augmentation: an elevation in adjacent-level fracture risk in kyphoplasty as compared with vertebroplasty.', 'Comparison of Percutaneous Vertebroplasty and Balloon Kyphoplasty for the Treatment of Single Level Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Meta-analysis of the Literature.', 'Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures: an evidenced-based review of the literature.']"""

Up to 71% of men with prostate cancer receiving radiation therapy experience acute and persistent CRF. There is neither an effective therapy nor a diagnostic biomarker for CRF. This pilot study aimed to discover potential biomarkers associated with chronic CRF in men with prostate cancer receiving radiation therapy.  Methods:   We used a longitudinal repeated-measures research design. Twenty men with prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy completed all study visits. CRF was evaluated by a well-established and validated questionnaire, the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System for Fatigue (PROMIS-F) Short Form. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested to quantify ribonucleic acid (RNA) gene expression of mitochondria-related genes. Data were collected before, during, on completion, and 24 months postradiation therapy and analyzed using paired t-tests and repeated-measures analysis of variance.  Results:   The mean of the PROMIS-F T score was significantly increased over time in patients with prostate cancer, remaining elevated at 24 months postradiation therapy compared to baseline. A significant downregulated BC1 ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase synthesis-like (BCS1L) was observed over time during radiation therapy and at 24 months postradiation therapy. An increased PROMIS-F score was trended with downregulated BCS1L in patients 24 months after completing radiation therapy.  Discussion:   This is the first evidence to describe altered messenger RNA for BCS1L in chronic CRF using the PROMIS-F measure with men receiving radiation therapy for prostate cancer.

Methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) -Medicare linked data from 2006-2016 were used to identify continuously enrolled Medicare beneficiaries with a first-time diagnosis of prostate cancer who, within 12 months of diagnosis, underwent at least one radiotherapy related service. Trends in the utilization of different radiotherapy techniques over time, yearly changes in per-patient costs of radiotherapy, and effect of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics on total cost were measured. Per patient annual costs, annual incidence of prostate cancer, and utilization of radiotherapy were used to estimate total costs of radiotherapy to the Medicare program.  Results:   For Medicare beneficiaries with a first-time diagnosis of prostate cancer, the utilization of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), proton therapy, and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) increased 23.62%, 0.74% and 1.61% respectively (p <0.0001) while brachytherapy decreased 17.04% (p <0.0001). Cost per beneficiary decreased $340.24 (95% CI: $136.05 - $544.43) annually (p = 0.0065). Age, registry region, and Gleason score were all associated with expenditures. The total cost to the Medicare program was estimated at US $1.16 billion in the year 2016.  Discussion:   In Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy, IMRT is the primary mode of treatment. Utilization of brachytherapy decreased significantly despite the efficacy and cost-effectiveness. Although per patient costs have decreased, the share of patient responsibility remained unaltered across years. The current costs to Medicare of radiotherapy for newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients is substantial.""","""['Kumar Mukherjee', 'William Small Jr', 'Richard Duszak Jr']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Use, complications, and costs of stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Cost implications of the rapid adoption of newer technologies for treating prostate cancer.', 'The early adoption of intensity-modulated radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiation treatment among older Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013.', 'Maximizing resources in the local treatment of prostate cancer: A summary of cost-effectiveness studies.', 'Pattern of Radiotherapy Treatment in Low-Risk, Intermediate-Risk, and High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients: Analysis of National Cancer Database.', 'Stereotactic Radiation Therapy versus Brachytherapy: Relative Strengths of Two Highly Efficient Options for the Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Data for men ≥40 years-old with no history of PCa were collected from the National Health Interview Survey for the years 2013, 2015, and 2018. Multivariable logistic regression models were created to determine the associations between sexual orientation and PCa screening and the discussion of advantages and disadvantages prior to PCa screening.  Results:   Gay men screened for prostate cancer were younger than their straight counterparts with a median age (IQR) of 58 years (52-66) vs 64 years (56-71).

Oxygen electrode studies suggest that localized prostate adenocarcinoma is commonly hypoxic, although conflicting data have been reported between immunohistochemical detection of hypoxia-induced proteins in biopsy specimens and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of 18F-labeled hypoxia reporters. Although the 2-nitroimidazole 18F-EF5 is well-established to label hypoxic tumour cells in pre-clinical tumour models and clinical trials of multiple primary tumour sites, it has yet to be tested in prostate cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using 18F-EF5 to detect hypoxia in clinical prostate tumours.  Material and methods:   Patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate were recruited for pre-treatment 18F-EF5 PET scans. Immunohistochemistry was conducted on diagnostic biopsies to assess the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), osteopontin (OPN), and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). Immunoreactivity scores of staining intensity and frequency were used to indicate the presence of tumour hypoxia.  Results:   We found low tumour-to-muscle ratios of 18F-EF5 uptake that were not consistent with tumour hypoxia, causing early termination of the study. However, we observed GLUT1 and OPN expression in all prostate tumour biopsies, indicating the presence of hypoxia in all tumours.

Results:   Using the same values as Van Howe, we confirmed his finding of a positive association of circumcision with prostate cancer (random effects summary OR = 1.14; 95% CI 0.99, 1.31). However, our independent meta-analysis found a negative association of circumcision with prostate cancer (random effects summary OR= 0.87; 95% CI 0.76, 1.00; p = 0.05). The reason for this critical discrepancy was Van Howe's erroneous transposition of values for circumcised and uncircumcised men in his Table columns, leading to inversion of the result. We further critically evaluated a geographical analysis and cost analysis of circumcision and prostate cancer, as well as claims denying a role for sexually transmitted infections in prostate cancer etiology, finding these too to be misleading.  Conclusions:   Van Howe's 2020 meta-analysis was based on erroneous data transposition leading to an inverted outcome. The journal concerned recently corrected his Table. Van Howe's claim of a positive association of circumcision with country-level-age standardized prostate cancer prevalence and his cost analysis were found to be questionable. Our meta-analysis showed that circumcision is associated with lower prostate cancer risk.""","""['Brian J Morris', 'Jim G Matthews', 'Noel Pabalan', 'Stephen Moreton', 'John N Krieger']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Circumcision and prostate cancer: a controversy revisited.', ""Veracity and rhetoric in paediatric medicine: a critique of Svoboda and Van Howe's response to the AAP policy on infant male circumcision."", 'Circumcision is a primary preventive against HIV infection: Critique of a contrary meta-regression analysis by Van Howe.', 'Circumcision status and risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections among men who have sex with men: a meta-analysis.', 'Circumcision and prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study in Montréal, Canada.', 'Male circumcision and prostate cancer: A geographical analysis, meta-analysis, and cost analysis.', 'Evidence-based circumcision policy for Australia.']"""

Specific factors affecting testosterone recovery after cessation of ADT have not been well-characterized in existing literature.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients at our institution who received ADT between 1999 and 2018. Patients with at least one course of ADT and subsequent testosterone level within 12 months of cessation of ADT were included. Patients received at least one of the following four agents: leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, and degarelix. Cox regression models were utilized to estimate the effect of patient and treatment characteristics on time to testosterone recovery(≥ 240 ng/dL) after ADT cessation. Patients without testosterone recovery were censored at last testosterone evaluation. To account for the possible dependency between multiple ADT courses within a patient, we used a robust sandwich variance estimate.  Results:   Severty-six patients were included. Mean age was 64 +/- 8 years. Median duration of ADT was 15 months, with a median time to recovery of 19 months. On univariable analysis, age and duration of ADT were significant; a trend towards significance was noted for hypertension, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, goserelin and bicalutamide. Patient age, duration of ADT, and treatment with the agent goserelin were significantly associated with prolonged hypogonadism on multivariable analysis (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Increasing age and duration of ADT therapy are associated with decreased likelihood to recover normal testosterone levels after cessation of therapy. The use of the ADT agent goserelin was also associated with decreased testosterone recovery for unclear reasons.""","""['Margaret E Long', 'Andrew M Vitale', 'Sarah L Mott', 'Chad Tracy', 'Rohan Garje', 'Yousef Zakharia', 'James A Brown']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['The type of ADT may matter for testosterone recovery.', 'Testosterone Recovery Profiles After Cessation of Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors associated with testosterone recovery after androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Hormonal response recovery after long-term androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Increased risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Renal Impairment: A Major Adverse Event in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy.']"""

Methods:   Both FDK_CBCT and iterative_CBCT images were reconstructed for 323 fractions of treatment for 10 prostate cancer patients. Planning CT images were deformably registered to each CBCT image data set. After daily dose distributions were computed, they were mapped to planning CT to obtain deformed doses. Dosimetric and image registration results based CBCT images reconstructed by two algorithms were compared at three levels: (A) voxel doses over entire dose calculation volume, (B) clinical constraint results on targets and sensitive structures, and (C) contours propagated to CBCT images using DIR results based on three algorithms (SmartAdapt, Velocity, and Elastix) were compared with manually delineated contours as ground truth.  Results:   (A) Average daily dose differences and average normalized DDA differences between FDK_CBCT and iterative_CBCT were ≤1 cGy. Maximum daily point dose differences increased from 0.22 ± 0.06 Gy (before the deformable dose mapping operation) to 1.33 ± 0.38 Gy after the deformable dose mapping. Maximum differences of normalized DDA per fraction were up to 0.80 Gy (0.42 ± 0.19 Gy). (B) Differences in target minimum doses were up to 8.31 Gy (-0.62 ± 4.60 Gy) and differences in critical structure doses were 0.70 ± 1.49 Gy. (C) For mapped prostate contours based on iterative_CBCT (relative to standard FDK_CBCT), dice similarity coefficient increased by 0.10 ± 0.09 (p < 0.0001), mass center distances decreased by 2.5 ± 3.0 mm (p < 0.00005), and Hausdorff distances decreased by 3.3 ± 4.4 mm (p < 0.00015).

Insilico methods have a major role in this approach. We used 60 FDA approved antiviral drugs reported in the last 50 years to screen against different cancer cell receptors. The thirteen compounds selected after virtual screening are analyzed for their druggability based on ADMET parameters and found the selectivity of guanine derivatives-didanosine, entecavir, acyclovir, valganciclovir, penciclovir, ganciclovir and valacyclovir as suitable candidates. The pharmacophore model, AARR, suggested based on the common feature alignment, shows that the two fused rings as in guanine and two acceptors-one from keto-oxygen (A5) and other from the substituent attached to nitrogen of imidazole ring (A4) give the druggability to the guanine derivatives. The NBO analysis on N9 is indicative of charge distribution from the ring to substituents, which results in delocalization of negative character in most of the ligands. The molecular dynamics simulations also pointed out the importance of guanine scaffold, which stabilizes the ligands inside the binding pocket of the receptor. All these results are indicative of the selectivity of guanine scaffold in anticancer drug development, especially as PARP1 inhibitors in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   Trials involving brachytherapy for breast, cervical, prostate, and uterine cancers were identified using ClinicalTrials.gov. The age, racial, and ethnic breakdown of the identified trials were compared to US population-estimates derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Primary outcomes were gaps between gaps between mean age and race and ethnic proportions in trials and the US population. Secondary outcomes included proportions of racial and ethnic data reporting. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, χ2 tests, and univariate analysis were used to analyze the data.  Results:   A total of 77 trials with reported data were identified, representing 13,580 patients. The overall difference in mean age in the identified trials compared to US population estimates was -2.29 years (p < 0.001), with the largest difference occurring in prostate cancer at -2.72 years (p < 0.001). With the exception of ethnicity in cervical cancer (p = 0.18), all racial and ethnic distributions were statistically significantly different.

Herein, we propose a joint categorical and ordinal learning framework for cancer grading in pathology images. The approach simultaneously performs both categorical classification and ordinal classification and aims to leverage the distinctive features from the two tasks. Moreover, we propose a new loss function for the ordinal classification task that offers an improved contrast between the correctly classified examples and misclassified examples. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple collections of colorectal and prostate pathology images that underwent different acquisition and processing procedures. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments of the experimental results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in comparison to other competing methods.

Facilities were stratified into 4 volume categories: low, intermediate, high, and very high. Primary cancer sites were divided into neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or definitive radiation subgroups. Kaplan-Meier curves of 5-year postradiation survival probability, stratified by facility volume, were generated with log-rank tests for group comparisons. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the effect of facility volume on survival, adjusted for multiple covariates.  Results:   There were 253,422 patients treated at 1289 facilities: 6231 received neoadjuvant radiation, 147,980 received adjuvant radiation, and 99,211 received definitive radiation without surgery. Among patients receiving neoadjuvant radiation, survival correlated with facility volume for patients with rectal cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.6-0.94; P = .01).

However, the low sensitivity of regular PSA tests in the PSA gray zone often means that patients are required to undergo further invasive needle biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, which may lead to potential overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, a circulating tumor cell (CTC)-chip based on an evaporation-induced reduced graphene oxide (rGO) coating is presented, which enables a highly specific and non-invasive diagnosis of prostate cancer in the PSA gray zone. During the evaporation process of the rGO dispersion, the Marangoni effect induces the self-assembly of a hierarchical micro/nanowrinkled rGO coating, which can capture CTCs after subsequent surface modification of capture agents. Compared to the low diagnostic sensitivity (58.3%) of regular PSA tests, a combination of CTC detection and PSA-based hematological tests via machine-learning analysis can greatly upgrade the diagnostic sensitivity of this disease to 91.7% in clinical trial.

For patients at greatest risk of developing rectal toxicities, hydrogel spacers are a viable option for risk reduction. Translation of clinical trial results into routine clinical practice relies on an understanding of the economic implications. This study completed a cost-effectiveness analysis of hydrogel spacers in the Australian healthcare setting.  Method:   Simulation of possible health states following treatment was performed using a Markov model. Model outcomes included the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the net monetary benefit (NMB) at three published willingness-to-pay thresholds derived from literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were provided on these results. A baseline cohort without hydrogel spacer use was compared to treat all and selective use cohorts. Cost variation scenarios were also investigated to assess the impact of hydrogel spacer cost on outcomes.  Results:   Using hydrogel spacers in a selective cohort was more likely to be cost-effective than giving to all patients (NMB -$43 versus -$997, respectively); however, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not below the $28 000 willingness-to-pay threshold for a healthcare provider perspective. These outcomes were influenced by large parameter uncertainty. Cost variation strategies are worth investigating further as a method to achieve willingness-to-pay threshold targets.  Conclusion:   The influence of parameter uncertainty currently limits the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in the Australian public health setting. However, a cost variation solution has been demonstrated to improve cost-effectiveness estimates for selected patients and should be examined further.""","""['Scott Jones', 'Nicole White', 'Tanya Holt', 'Nicholas Graves']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Hydrogel Rectal Spacer in Prostate Cancer Radiation Therapy.', 'Decision analysis model evaluating the cost of a temporary hydrogel rectal spacer before prostate radiation therapy to reduce the incidence of rectal complications.', 'Placement of an absorbable rectal hydrogel spacer in patients undergoing low-dose-rate brachytherapy with palladium-103.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Foreign body removal with the assistance of ultrasound guidance and methylene blue staining in children-a cohort study.']"""

It has been demonstrated that transforming gene expression to pathway-level information can improve the robustness and interpretability of disease grouping results. This approach, referred to as biological knowledge-driven clustering (BK-CL) approach, is often neglected, due to a lack of tools enabling systematic comparisons with more established DR-based methods. Moreover, classic clustering metrics based on group separability tend to favor the DR-CL paradigm, which may increase the risk of identifying less actionable disease subtypes that have ambiguous biological and clinical explanations. Hence, there is a need for developing metrics that assess biological and clinical relevance. To facilitate the systematic analysis of BK-CL methods, we propose a computational protocol for quantitative analysis of clustering results derived from both DR-CL and BK-CL methods. Moreover, we propose a new BK-CL method that combines prior knowledge of disease relevant genes, network diffusion algorithms and gene set enrichment analysis to generate robust pathway-level information. Benchmarking studies were conducted to compare the grouping results from different DR-CL and BK-CL approaches with respect to standard clustering evaluation metrics, concordance with known subtypes, association with clinical outcomes and disease modules in co-expression networks of genes. No single approach dominated every metric, showing the importance multi-objective evaluation in clustering analysis. However, we demonstrated that, on gene expression data sets derived from TCGA samples, the BK-CL approach can find groupings that provide significant prognostic value in both breast and prostate cancers.""","""['Teemu J Rintala', 'Antonio Federico', 'Leena Latonen', 'Dario Greco', 'Vittorio Fortino']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Brief Bioinform""","""['Clustering approaches for visual knowledge exploration in molecular interaction networks.', 'Gene expression analysis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma using gene set enrichment analysis for biostatistical management.', 'A network-assisted co-clustering algorithm to discover cancer subtypes based on gene expression.', 'It is time to apply biclustering: a comprehensive review of biclustering applications in biological and biomedical data.', 'Functional genomics and proteomics in the clinical neurosciences: data mining and bioinformatics.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of the Oncogenic Role of Targeting Protein for Xklp2 (TPX2) in Human Malignancies.']"""

This gene was primarily found and identified in our lab of Peking University School of Basic Medical Sciences. The LAPTM4B-35 protein and its encoded mRNA are significantly over-expressed in a variety of cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), lung cancers (including non small-cell lung cancer and small-cell lung cancer), stomach cancer, colorectal carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, gallbladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, endometrial cancer, and so on. It has firmly demonstrated through lab experiments either in vivo or in vitro, as well as clinical studies that the over-expression of LAPTM4B-35 can promote cancer growth, metastasis, and multidrug resistance. Specially, the expressive level of LAPTM4B-35 is associa-ted with recurrence of HCC. The aim of this study is to identify the release of LAPTM4B-35 protein from hepatocellular carcinoma into blood of HCC patients and into the medium of cultured HCC cells, and to identify its possible form of LAPTM4B-35 protein existed in blood and cell culture medium, as well as to explore the possibility of LAPTM4B-35 protein as a novel HCC biomarker for diagnosis of HCC and prognosis of HCC patients.  Methods:   Immunobloting (Western blot) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used for identification of LAPTM4B-35 protein in the blood of HCC patients and normal individuals. Ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation were used to isolate and purify exosomes from the culture medium of HCC cells.  Results:   LAPTM4B-35 protein existed in the blood from HCC patients and normal donors that were demonstrated through Western blot and ELISA. LAPTM4B-35 was also released into the culture medium of HCC cells in the form of exosomes. Preliminary experiments showed that the average and the median of LAPTM4B-35 protein level in the blood of HCC patients (n=43) were both significantly higher than that in the blood of normal donors (n=33) through sandwich ELISA.  Conclusion:   It is promising that the LAPTM4B-35 protein which is released from HCC cells in the form of exosomes into their extraenvironment may be exploited as a novel cancer biomarker for HCC serological diagnosis.""","""['Y Pang', 'S Zhang', 'H Yang', 'R L Zhou']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Expression of lysosome-associated protein transmembrane 4B-35 in cancer and its correlation with the differentiation status of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'LAPTM4B-35 overexpression is a risk factor for tumor recurrence and poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Identification and characterization of LAPTM4B encoded by a human hepatocellular carcinoma-associated novel gene.', 'Structure analysis and expressions of a novel tetratransmembrane protein, lysosoma-associated protein transmembrane 4 beta associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Significance of exosomes in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Serum LAPTM4B as a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarker for Breast Cancer.', 'Extracellular Vesicles and Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Opportunities and Challenges.']"""

Methods:   From January 2019 to January 2021, a consecutive series of patients with localized prostate cancer (cT1-T3, cN0, cM0) were prospectively collected. RARP with total anatomical reconstruction was performed in all the cases by an experienced surgeon. Lymph node dissection was performed if the patient was in high-risk group according to the D'Amico risk classification. The primary endpoint was urinary continence recovery time after catheter removal. Postoperative and pathological variables were analyzed. Continence was rigo-rously analyzed 48 hours, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after catheter removal. Continence was evaluated by recording diaper pads used per day, and all the patients were instructed to perform the 24-hour pad weight test until full recovery of urinary continence. The patient was defined as continent if no more than one safety pad were needed per day, or no more than 20-gram urine leakage on the 24-hour pad weight test. Time from catheter removal to full recovery of urinary continence was recorded, and risk factors influencing continence recovery time evaluated.  Results:   In total, 166 patients were analyzed. The mean age of the enrolled patients was 66.2 years, and the median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 8.51 μg/L. A total of 59 patients (35.5%) had bilateral lymphatic dissection, and 28 (16.9%) underwent neurovascular bundle (NVB) preservation surgery. Postoperative pathology results showed that stage pT1 in 1 case (0.6%), stage pT2 in 77 cases (46.4%), stage pT3 in 86 cases (51.8%), and positive margins in 28 patients (16.9%). Among patients who underwent lymph node dissection, lymph node metastasis was found in 7 cases (11.9%). Median continence recovery time was one week. The number of the continent patients at the end of 48 hours, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks were 65 (39.2%), 32 (19.3%), 34 (20.5%), 24 (14.5%), and 9 (5.4%). Two patients remained incontinent 24 weeks after catheter removal. The continence rates after catheter removal at the end of 48 hours, 1 week, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks were 39.2%, 58.4%, 78.9%, 93.4%, and 98.8%, respectively. Univariate COX analysis revealed that diabetes appeared to influence continence recovery time (OR=1.589, 95%CI: 1.025-2.462, P=0.038). At the end of 48 hours, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after catheter removal, the mean OABSS score of the continent group was significantly lower than that of the incontinent group.  Conclusion:   RARP showed promising results in the recovery of urinary continence. Diabetes was a risk factor influencing continence recovery time.

All the patients received MRI examination before surgery. Membranous urethral length (MUL) was defined as the distance from the apex of prostate to the level of the urethra at penile bulb on the coronal image. PAD was defined as the distance from the apex of prostate to the suprapubic ridge line on sagittal MRI. PAD ratio (PADR) was defined as PAD/pubic height. All the patients received extraperitoneal LRP. The patients' reporting freedom from using safety pad (0 pad/d) were defined as urinary continence. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of early continence recovery after LRP. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank test were used to compare time to continence recovery between the groups.  Results:   For all the 184 patients, the average age was (69.0±7.7) years, the ave-rage mass index(BMI) was (25.07±3.29) kg/m2, and the pre-biopsy PSA was (16.80±21.99) g/L.

Methods:   We performed a network meta-analysis to compare the change of BMDs and the risk of vertebral fracture in the studies included using a random-effect model. The primary outcomes are the change of BMD of the lumbar spine (LS) and the total hip (TH) from the baseline at 1 year from the initiation of the BMA and the risk of vertebral fracture.  Results:   We identified and included 15 studies in this analysis. All BMAs except risedronate showed a significant increase of BMD of the LS compared with groups without BMA, among which zoledronate showed the most BMD gain. At TH, bisphosphonates (alendronate, pamidronate, and zoledronate) and denosumab showed significant elevation compared with the no-BMA group. Denosumab was associated with the most BMD gain at the TH. Only denosumab reduced the risk of vertebral fracture (relative risk [95% confidence interval]: 0.40 [0.20-0.81]).

Bevezetés: A prosztatarák kezelésében jelentős szerepet kapnak a különböző sugárterápiás eljárások. Ennek ellenére a vizelési képességre gyakorolt, rövid és hosszú távú mellékhatásaikat objektív vizsgálómódszerrel igen kevés tanulmányban vizsgálták. Célkitűzés: Arra a kérdésre kerestük a választ, hogy hogyan változik a korai vizelési képesség a különböző sugárterápiás eljárások során. Módszerek: A vizsgálatunkban meghatározott protokoll szerint a kezelés előtt minden bevont beteggel IPSS-t (nemzetközi prosztatatünet-értékelő lap) töltettünk ki, illetve uroflow (vizeletáramlási) vizsgálatot végeztünk, suprapubicus ultrahanggal meghatározott mictiós residuum méréssel kiegészítve. A sugárkezelés befejezésétől számított 4-6 héten belül ismételten elvégeztük ezeket a vizsgálatokat, melyekbe összesen 26 beteget vontunk be. A kezelési modalitások szerint 6, kis dózisteljesítményű (low-dose rate; LDR) brachytherapiában, 5, nagy dózisteljesítményű (high-dose rate; HDR) brachytherapiában, 12, Cyberknife (CK) készüléken extrém hipofrakcionált sugárkezelésben és 3, lineáris gyorsítón (LINAC) mérsékelten hipofrakcionált sugárkezelésben részesített prosztatarákos beteget választottunk be. A kezelések hasonlósága miatt az LDR- és a HDR-csoportot együttesen brachytherapiás csoportként (BTCS), a CK- és a LINAC-csoportot teleterápiás csoportként (TTCS) vizsgáltuk. Eredmények: A BTCS betegeinél az IPSS- és az uroflow paraméterek korai romlása (IPSS irritatív panaszok: p = 0,003, IPSS obstruktív panaszok: p = 0,011, maximális áramlás: p = 0,003, átlagos áramlás: p = 0,006) szignifikánsnak bizonyult, a TTCS-ban mindösszesen az IPSS irritatív tünetekben volt kimutatható eltérés (p = 0,011). Következtetés: A sugárterápiás modalitás kiválasztása előtt javasolható az uroflow és az IPSS-vizsgálat elvégzése. Eredményeink alapján azoknál a betegeknél, akiknél a kezelés előtt középsúlyos vagy súlyos dysuriás vizelési panaszok állnak fenn, a brachytherapia helyett teleterápiás módszerek alkalmazását javasoljuk, amelyek kevésbé rontják a betegek korai vizeletürítési képességét. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(33): 1328-1334.  Introduction:   Various radiotherapy procedures are applied in the treatment of prostate cancer. Nevertheless, their early and late side effects measured by uroflow and residual volume measurements have not been studied extensively.  Objective:   We investigated by objective methods the early changes of urination ability after different radiotherapy procedures.  Methods:   According to the protocol defined in our study, all patients had their IPSS (international prostate symptom score) determined, as well as their uroflow examinations and measurements of their residual urine via suprapubic ultrasound, carried out before treatment. These tests were then repeated at 4-6 weeks after the end of their radiotherapy. A total of 26 patients were included in the study. 6 patients were treated with low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy and 5 patients with high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, 12 patients with Cyberknife (CK) using extreme hypofractionation and 3 patients with moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy with a linear accelerator (LINAC). Due to the similarity of the treatments, the LDR and HDR groups together were also studied as brachytherapy group and the CK and LINAC patients as teletherapy group.  Results:   We found that the early deterioration of IPSS and uroflow parameters after brachytherapy were significant (IPSS irritative symptoms: p = 0.003, IPSS obstructive symptoms: p = 0.011, maximum flow: p = 0.003, mean flow: p = 0.006), while in teletherapy only the IPSS irritative symptoms worsened significantly (p = 0.011).  Conclusion:   Based on our results, we suggest to perform uroflow examination and IPSS test before selecting therapeutic modality for patients with prostate cancer. In patients with moderate or severe urinary complaints before the treatment, we recommend to use teletherapy rather than brachytherapy.

Materials and methods:   Five pet dogs with histopathologically proven prostate cancer were referred for prostate artery chemoembolization (PACE). After PACE, all animals were followed, including pharmacokinetic study and clinical and biological evolution, until death. Pelvic contrast-enhanced computed tomography examination was performed at one and two months. Animals were subjected to pathological examination after death.  Results:   Both prostate arteries were successfully chemoembolized in all dogs. A median dose of 18 mg (Q1, Q3; 11.8, 20 mg) docetaxel loaded in 3 mL of 50-100 µm super absorbent polymer beads was injected into each dog. At one month, four of the five dogs were still alive and the median prostate volume was 51% lower (prePACE median prostate volume, 18.4 mL [Q1, Q3; 12, 32.1 mL] vs. postPACE median prostate volume, 6.2 mL [Q1, Q3; 6.2, 11 mL]). At two months, three dogs died because of disease progression. The two remaining dogs showed a 70% median decrease in prostate volume. Prostate pathological examination showed 73% of necrosis. No worsening of urinary symptoms was observed. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed limited systemic passage of docetaxel. All dogs died of metastatic spread at nine months.

We aimed to compare a traditional screening approach with a diagnostic strategy of blood-based risk prediction combined with MRI-targeted biopsies.  Methods:   We did a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial (STHLM3-MRI) in Stockholm county, Sweden. Men aged 50-74 years were randomly selected by Statistics Sweden and invited by mail to participate in screening; those with an elevated risk of prostate cancer, defined as either a PSA of 3 ng/mL or higher or a Stockholm3 score of 0·11 or higher were eligible for randomisation. Men with a previous prostate cancer diagnosis, who had undergone a prostate biopsy within 60 days before the invitation to participate, with a contraindication for MRI, or with severe illness were excluded. Eligible participants were randomly assigned (2:3) using computer-generated blocks of five, stratified by clinically significant prostate cancer risk, to receive either systematic prostate biopsies (standard group) or biparametric MRI followed by MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy in MRI-positive participants (experimental group). The primary outcome was the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer at prostate biopsy, defined as a Gleason score of 3 + 4 or higher. We used a margin of 0·78 to assess non-inferiority for the primary outcome. Key secondary outcome measures included the proportion of men with clinically insignificant prostate cancer (defined as a Gleason score of 3 + 3), and the number of any prostate MRI and biopsy procedures done. We did two comparisons: Stockholm3 (using scores of 0·11 and 0·15 as cutoffs) versus PSA in the experimental group (paired analyses) and PSA plus standard biopsy versus Stockholm3 plus MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy (unpaired, randomised analyses). All analyses were intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03377881.  Findings:   Between Feb 5, 2018, and March 4, 2020, 49 118 men were invited to participate, of whom 12 750 were enrolled and provided blood specimens, and 2293 with elevated risk were randomly assigned to the experimental group (n=1372) or the standard group (n=921). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer was 0·76 (95% CI 0·72-0·80) for Stockholm3 and 0·60 (0·54-0·65) for PSA. In the experimental group, a Stockholm3 of 0·11 or higher was non-inferior to a PSA of 3 ng/mL or higher for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (227 vs 192; relative proportion [RP] 1·18 [95% CI 1·09-1·28], p<0·0001 for non-inferiority), and also detected a similar number of low-grade prostate cancers (50 vs 41; 1·22 [0·96-1·55], p=0·053 for superiority) and was associated with more MRIs and biopsies. Compared with PSA of 3 ng/mL or higher, a Stockholm3 of 0·15 or higher provided identical sensitivity to detect clinically significant cancer, and led to fewer MRI procedures (545 vs 846; 0·64 [0·55-0·82]) and fewer biopsy procedures (311 vs 338; 0·92 (0·86-1·03). Compared with screening using PSA and systematic biopsies, a Stockholm3 of 0·11 or higher combined with MRI-targeted and systematic biopsies was associated with higher detection of clinically significant cancers (227 [3·0%] men tested vs 106 [2·1%] men tested; RP 1·44 [95% CI 1·15-1·81]), lower detection of low-grade cancers (50 [0·7%] vs 73 [1·4%]; 0·46 [0·32-0·66]), and led to fewer biopsy procedures. Patients randomly assigned to the experimental group had a lower incidence of prescription of antibiotics for infection (25 [1·8%] of 1372 vs 41 [4·4%] of 921; p=0·0002) and a lower incidence of admission to hospital (16 [1·2%] vs 31 [3·4%]; p=0·0003) than those in the standard group.  Interpretation:   The Stockholm3 test can inform risk stratification before MRI and targeted biopsies in prostate cancer screening. Combining the Stockholm3 test with an MRI-targeted biopsy approach for prostate cancer screening decreases overdetection while maintaining the ability to detect clinically significant cancer.

Thus, we evaluated the circSMARCA5 functional relevance in prostate cancer and its associated molecular mechanism. First, circSMARCA5 expression and function in this cancer were evaluated. To determine the miR-181b-5p/miR-17-3p target and clarify how circSMARCA5 regulates the miR-181b-5p-TIMP3 and miR-17-3p-TIMP3 axis, RNA immunoprecipitation, biotin-coupled microRNA capture, luciferase reporter, Western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR assays were employed. In primary and metastatic prostate cancer tissues, circSMARCA5 was significantly downregulated compared with normal controls. Functionally, circSMARCA5 exhibited a suppressive effect on prostate cancer cells' metastasis and growth. At the molecular level, circSMARCA5 could affect the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) expression through miR-181b-5p or miR-17-3p interactions. Moreover, lysine acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5) induced circSMARCA5 biogenesis and regulated the miR-181b-5p-TIMP3 and miR-17-3p-TIMP3 axis.

We aimed to evaluate the correlation between the histopathological features and biochemical recurrence (BCR) in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) using the new classification.  Methods:   A total of 285 prostate adenocarcinoma cases that underwent RP between January 2009 and December 2017 and followed up for at least 3 months were included in the study. The cases were re-evaluated according to WHO-ISUP 2016 classification and the findings were recorded.  Results:   The mean age was 63,4 years. Gleason scores of the cases were as follows: 3+3 144 cases (50.5%), 3+4 81 cases (28.4%), 4+3 28 cases (9.8%), 4+4 7 cases (2.5%) , 3+5 6 cases (2.1%), 5+3 2 cases (0.7%), 4+5 17 cases (6%). There were 198 (69,5%) pT2, 54 (18,9%) pT3a and 33 (11,6%) pT3b cases. The mean follow-up time was 44,1 months and BCR was detected in 97 cases (34%). The relationship between the Group Grades and BCR was statistically significant. BCR rate increased as the tumour volume and the percentage of pattern 4 increased (P < .001).There was a significant correlation between preoperative PSA value, extraprostatic extension, seminal vesicle invasion, surgical margin positivity, tumour volume, pattern 4 percentage, presence of cribriform glands and BCR and recurrence-free survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis and recurrence-free survival was also affected by these parameters. Among the morphological subtypes of Pattern 4, recurrence-free survival decreased as the incidence of cribriform glands increased (P < .001).

Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) is a bottom-up costing tool that measures resource use over the full care cycle. We applied standard QI and TDABC methods to improve workflow efficiency and reduce costs for MRI-guided prostate brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   We constructed process maps of the baseline prostate brachytherapy workflow from initial consultation through one year after treatment. Process maps reflected resources and time required at each step. TDABC costs were calculated by multiplying each process time by the cost per min of the resource(s) used at that step. We then used plan-do-study-act methodology to identify workflow inefficiencies and implement solutions to reduce resource consumption.  Results:   The highest cost components at baseline were the operating room (OR) (40%), imaging (8.7%), and consultation (7.6%). Higher-than-expected costs (3%) were incurred during surgery scheduling. After targeted QI initiatives, OR time was reduced from 90 to 70 min, which reduced overall cost by 5%. Personnel task downshifting reduced costs by 10% at consultation and 77% at surgery scheduling. Re-engineering of follow-up protocols reduced costs by 8.4%.

Methods:   Patients with mCRPC treated between April 2016 and August 2020, who experienced biochemical progression on A + P and then switched to A plus dexamethasone (D), were retrospectively identified. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary endpoints were PSA response, overall survival (OS), and safety.  Results:   One hundred and thirty consecutive cases were enrolled. The median PFS and OS on A + D were 5.0 and 18.7 months, respectively. The best PSA decline of ≥50% (PSA50) and ≥ 30% (PSA30) were observed in 29.2 and 46.2% patients, respectively. Lower PSA at corticosteroid switch (≤ 20 ng/mL; median PFS, HR 0.63, p = 0.019; median OS, HR 0.38, p = 0.001) and longer mCRPC-free survival (≥ 18 months; median PFS, HR 0.61, p = 0.013; median OS, HR 0.51, p = 0.015) were identified as independent prognostic predictors associated with longer PFS and OS. A risk stratification tool was developed to select candidates for corticosteroid switch based on the independent prognostic predictors of PFS and OS.  Conclusions:   A corticosteroid switch from prednisone to dexamethasone is effective for mCRPC which progressed on A + P treatment.

Cisplatin increased tumor PD-L1 expression, promoted chemotherapy resistance. Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-induced PD-L1 expression might facilitate immunotherapy resistance. Methylseleninic acid (MSeA), a selenium (Se) compound, offered superior cancer chemo-preventive activities and enhanced tumor sensitivity to diverse chemotherapeutic drugs. This study explored the effects of MSeA on the PD-L1-mediated resistance using both in vitro and in vivo models. Results showed that MSeA substantially attenuated cisplatin-induced PD-L1 expression via inhibiting protein kinase B phosphorylation, thereby potentiated cisplatin cytotoxicity in prostate and lung cancer cell models. In lung cancer xenograft model, MSeA significantly suppressed cisplatin-induced PD-L1 expression, consequently enhanced T-cell immunity, ultimately improved the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin. Moreover, IFN-γ-induced tumor PD-L1 expression was remarkably reduced by MSeA, with correlated reductions in janus kinase 2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in prostate and lung cancer cell models. Our findings, for the first time, demonstrated that MSeA is a potential agent to overcome PD-L1-mediated chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance.

This study examined whether insomnia symptoms mediate the relationship between ADT and perceived cognitive function and whether depressive symptoms, fatigue severity, and physical activity moderate the strength of this relationship.  Methods:   This was a prospective study of ADT recipients (n = 83) who were matched with control patients with PCa who were not on ADT (n = 92) and with controls with no history of cancer (n = 112) over a 2-year follow-up period. Perceived cognitive function and satisfaction were assessed with the Everyday Cognition Scale. Insomnia was assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted to estimate the indirect effect of ADT on perceived cognitive function through insomnia symptoms. Exploratory moderated mediation analyses assessed whether the indirect effect of ADT on perceived cognitive function through insomnia symptoms was dependent on levels of fatigue, depression, or physical activity.  Results:   Insomnia symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between receipt of ADT and perceived cognitive function (P < .001) and satisfaction with cognition (P < .001) after controlling for comorbidities. Men with greater fatigue had a more pronounced association of ADT with insomnia severity. Men with greater depressive symptoms had a stronger association between insomnia severity and worse perceived cognitive function. Physical activity was not a significant moderator of the relationship between ADT and perceived cognitive function.

Perilipins are structural proteins associated with lipophagy and lipid droplet integrity, and their overexpression is associated with tumor aggressiveness. Here, we sought to explore the role of lipid droplet-related protein perilipin-3 (PLIN3) in prostate cancer (PCa) chemotherapy. We investigated the role of PLIN3 suppression in docetaxel cytotoxic activity in PCa cell lines. Additional effects of PLIN3 depletion on autophagy-related proteins and gene expression patterns, apoptotic potential, proliferation rate, and ATP levels were examined. Depletion of PLIN3 resulted in docetaxel resistance, accompanied by enhanced autophagic flux. We further assessed the synergistic effect of autophagy suppression with chloroquine on docetaxel cytotoxicity. Inhibition of autophagy with chloroquine reversed chemoresistance of stably transfected shPLIN3 PCa cell lines, with no effect on the parental ones. The shPLIN3 cell lines also exhibited reduced Caspase-9 related apoptosis initiation. Moreover, we assessed PLIN3 expression in a series of PCa tissue specimens, were complete or partial loss of PLIN3 expression was frequently noted in 70% of the evaluated specimens. Following PLIN3 silencing, PCa cells were characterized by impaired lipophagy and acquired an enhanced autophagic response upon docetaxel-induced cytotoxic stress. Such an adaptation leads to resistance to docetaxel, which could be reversed by the autophagy blocker chloroquine.

Exercise has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, physical functioning, body composition, fatigue, and quality of life during and after treatment; however, to date only 1 exercise study has been conducted in this clinical setting.  Objective:   To examine the effects of exercise on cardiorespiratory fitness and biochemical progression in men with prostate cancer who were undergoing active surveillance.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Exercise During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer (ERASE) trial was a single-center, 2-group, phase 2 randomized clinical trial conducted at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. Eligible patients were recruited from July 24, 2018, to February 5, 2020. Participants were adult men who were diagnosed with localized very low risk to favorable intermediate risk prostate cancer and undergoing active surveillance. They were randomized to either the high-intensity interval training (HIIT) group or usual care group. All statistical analyses were based on the intention-to-treat principle.  Interventions:   The HIIT group was asked to complete 12 weeks of thrice-weekly, supervised aerobic sessions on a treadmill at 85% to 95% of peak oxygen consumption (V̇o2). The usual care group maintained their normal exercise levels.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was peak V̇o2, which was assessed as the highest value of oxygen uptake during a graded exercise test using a modified Bruce protocol. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were indicators of biochemical progression of prostate cancer, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and PSA kinetics, and growth of prostate cancer cell line LNCaP.  Results:   A total of 52 male patients, with a mean (SD) age of 63.4 (7.1) years, were randomized to either the HIIT (n = 26) or usual care (n = 26) groups. Overall, 46 of 52 participants (88%) completed the postintervention peak V̇o2 assessment, and 49 of 52 participants (94%) provided blood samples. Adherence to HIIT was 96%. The primary outcome of peak V̇o2 increased by 0.9 mL/kg/min in the HIIT group and decreased by 0.5 mL/kg/min in the usual care group (adjusted between-group mean difference (1.6 mL/kg/min; 95% CI, 0.3-2.9; P = .01). Compared with the usual care group, the HIIT group experienced decreased PSA level (-1.1 μg/L; 95% CI, -2.1 to 0.0; P = .04), PSA velocity (-1.3 μg /L/y; 95% CI, -2.5 to -0.1; P = .04), and LNCaP cell growth (-0.13 optical density unit; 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.02; P = .02). No statistically significant differences were found in PSA doubling time or testosterone.  Conclusions and relevance:   The ERASE trial demonstrated that HIIT increased cardiorespiratory fitness levels and decreased PSA levels, PSA velocity, and prostate cancer cell growth in men with localized prostate cancer who were under active surveillance. Larger trials are warranted to determine whether such improvement translates to better longer-term clinical outcomes in this setting.

We present one case of nanoparticle-directed ablation and two cases of cryoablation to focally treat prostate tumors. Patients and Methods: Three patients underwent MRI/ultrasound fusion transperineal prostate biopsies to confirm low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The MRI lesions correlated with the biopsy-proven disease. Pelvic MRI segmentation was performed with DynaCAD 5.0 workstation. The MRI lesion including a 6 to 10 mm margin, prostate, bladder, urethra, urethral sphincter, rectum, and pubic bone were segmented. MRI/ultrasound fusion was performed with the novel Philips UroNav 4.0 system. Lesions were treated with focal nanoparticle ablation or focal cryoablation. Results: A 69-year-old man with a right posterior medial peripheral zone lesion positive for Gleason grade group (GG)3 cancer was treated with focal nanoparticle ablation. The UroNav 4.0 system reported 100% ablation of the segmented tumor and 94% of the 6 to 10 mm margin at the end of the case. A 68-year-old man with a left anterior fibromuscular stroma lesion positive for Gleason GG2 cancer and a 71-year-old man with a right peripheral zone posterior lateral lesion positive for Gleason GG1 cancer were treated with focal cryoablation. The UroNav 4.0 system reported 100% ablation of the segmented tumor and 82% of the 6 to 10 mm margin at the end of the case. Conclusion: Observation of the prostate tumor(s), surrounding critical structures, and pelvis in three dimensions (3D), along with the anticipated ablation zone, is one of the challenges of pelvic surgery and percutaneous ablation. The DynaCAD 5.0 Urology system can create an auto-segmented 3D rendering of critical structures and the tumor(s), as well as observation and quantification of the anticipated ablation coverage, to facilitate preoperative planning of needle placement.

Molecular subtyping may be useful in predicting aggressive cancers and directing therapy. One such subtype involving deletions of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1), a tumor suppressor gene, are found in 10-26% of PCa tumors. In this study, we evaluate the functional cellular effects that follow CHD1 deletion.  Methods: CHD1 was knocked out (KO) in the non-tumorigenic, human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16)-immortalized prostate epithelial cell line, RWPE-1, using CRISPR/Cas9. In vitro assays such as T7 endonuclease assay, western blot, and sequencing were undertaken to characterize the CHD1 KO clones. Morphologic and functional assays for cell adhesion and viability were performed. To study expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and adhesion molecules, a real-time (RT) profiler assay was performed using RWPE-1 parental, non-target cells (NT2) and CHD1 KO cells.  Result:   Compared to parental RWPE-1 and non-target cells (NT2), the CHD1 KO cells had a smaller, rounder morphology and were less adherent under routine culture conditions. Compared to parental cells, CHD1 KO cells showed a reduction in ECM and adhesion molecules as well as a greater proportion of viable suspension cells when cultured on standard tissue culture plates and on plates coated with laminin, fibronectin or collagen I. CHD1 KO cells showed a decrease in the expression of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), integrin subunit alpha 2 (ITGA2), integrin subunit alpha 5 (ITGA5), integrin subunit alpha 6 (ITGA6), fibronectin (FN1), laminin subunit beta-3 precursor (LAMB3), collagen, tenascin and vitronectin as compared to parental and NT2 cells.  Conclusion:   These data suggest that in erythroblast transformation specific (ETS) fusion-negative, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) wildtype PCa, deletion of CHD1 alters cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion dynamics, suggesting an important role for CHD1 in the development and progression of PCa.""","""['Aparna Kareddula', 'Daniel J Medina', 'Whitney Petrosky', 'Sonia Dolfi', 'Irina Tereshchenko', 'Kelly Walton', 'Hana Aviv', 'Evita Sadimin', 'Alexandra L Tabakin', 'Eric A Singer', 'Kim M Hirshfield']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ther Adv Urol""","""['CHD1 deletion stabilizes HIF1α to promote angiogenesis and glycolysis in prostate cancer.', 'CHD1 loss sensitizes prostate cancer to DNA damaging therapy by promoting error-prone double-strand break repair.', 'CHD1 and SPOP synergistically protect prostate epithelial cells from DNA damage.', 'Organ-specific regulation of CHD1 by acute PTEN and p53 loss in mice.', 'CHD1, a multifaceted epigenetic remodeler in prostate cancer.', 'Regulation and Functions of α6-Integrin (CD49f) in Cancer Biology.']"""

We evaluated the effect of AA on androgens in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) metastases and associations of intratumoral androgens with response.  Experimental design:   We performed a phase II study of AA plus prednisone in mCRPC. The primary outcome was tissue testosterone at 4 weeks. Exploratory outcomes were association of steroid levels and genomic alterations with response, and escalating AA to 2,000 mg at progression.  Results:   Twenty-nine of 30 men were evaluable. Testosterone in metastatic biopsies became undetectable at 4 weeks (P < 0.001). Serum and tissue dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) remained detectable in many patients and was not increased at progression.

Methods and design:   IP4-CHRONOS is a randomised, unblinded multi-centre study, including two parallel randomised controlled trials targeting the same patient population: IP4-CHRONOS-A and IP4-CHRONOS-B. IP4-CHRONOS-A is a 1:1 RCT and the other is a multi-arm, multi-stage (MAMS) RCT starting with three arms and a 1:1:1 randomisation. The two linked RCTs are discussed with patients at the time of consent and the choice of A or B is dependent on physician and patient equipoise. The primary outcome is the feasibility of recruitment, acceptance of randomisation and compliance to allocated arm.  Results:   This paper describes the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the feasibility study within IP4-CHRONOS given its innovative approach. Version 1.0 of the SAP has been reviewed by the Trial Steering Committee (TSC), Chief Investigator (CI), Senior Statistician and Trial Statistician and signed off. The study is ongoing and recruiting. Recruitment is scheduled to finish later in 2021. The SAP documents approved methods and analyses that will be conducted. Since this is written in advance of the analysis, we avoid bias arising from prior knowledge of the study data and findings.  Discussion:   Our feasibility analysis will demonstrate if IP4-CHRONOS is feasible in terms of recruitment, randomisation and compliance, and whether to continue both A and B or just one to the main stage.

Methods:   Thirty-four patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer were studied prospectively. Data collection involved the administration of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and a radical prostatectomy knowledge test.  Results:   The results showed that 94.1% of the patients reported having received clarifications from the physician or healthcare team regarding the surgery and 23.5% reported having received information on the probability of a medical error during surgery. The most cited postoperative complications were sexual impotence and urinary incontinence. A significant association was found between the total Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score and the complications cited (p=0.0004); patients who marked a larger number of possible complications had a higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the risk of multi-factorial complications (febrile genitourinary tract infection (GUTI), rectal bleeding, and urinary retention) after TRUSPB.  Methods:   N = 2053 patients were Japanese patients undergoing transrectal or transperineal TRUSPB for suspicious of PCa. To assess risk of febrile GUTI adequately, the patients were divided into four groups: low-risk patients before starting a rectal culture, low-risk patients after starting a rectal culture, high-risk patients, and patients undergoing transperineal TRUSPB. Furthermore, to identify risk of rectal bleeding and urinary retention, patients were divided into transrectal and transperineal group.  Results:   Febrile GUTI significantly decreased owing to risk classification. The frequency of rectal bleeding was 1.43% (transrectal: 25/1742), while it did not happen in transperineal group. The patients with rectal bleeding had a significantly lower body mass index (BMI) (P < 0.01). The frequency of urinary retention was 5.57% (transrectal: 97/1742), while it did not happen in transperineal group. The patients with urinary retention had a significantly higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (P = 0.01) in transrectal group.  Conclusions:   Risk classification, rectal swab culture, and selected antimicrobial prophylaxis for transrectal TRUSPB were extremely effective to reduce the risk of febrile GUTI. Furthermore, lower BMI and higher PSA were novel clinical predictors for rectal bleeding and urinary retention, respectively. When urologists perform transrectal TRUSPB to their patients, they can correctly understand and explain each complication risk to their patients based on these novel risk factors.""","""['Takanobu Utsumi', 'Takumi Endo', 'Yuka Sugizaki', 'Takamichi Mori', 'Takatoshi Somoto', 'Seiji Kato', 'Ryo Oka', 'Masashi Yano', 'Naoto Kamiya', 'Hiroyoshi Suzuki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Clin Oncol""","""['Implications of faecal ESBL carriers undergoing TRUS-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB): role of screening prior to TRUSPB.', 'Targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis using rectal swab cultures in men undergoing transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy is associated with reduced incidence of postoperative infectious complications and cost of care.', 'The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'Baseline prevalence of antimicrobial resistance and subsequent infection following prostate biopsy using empirical or altered prophylaxis: A bias-adjusted meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of fosfomycin against fluoroquinolones for transrectal prostate biopsy prophylaxis: an individual patient-data meta-analysis.']"""

This process is involved in the initiation and development of malignant disease. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), a classic DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, possesses antitumor proliferation activity. However, whether 5-Aza induces cytotoxicity in solid tumors warrants further investigated. In this study, human prostate cancer (CaP) cells were treated with 5-Aza and subjected to cell viability and cytotoxicity analysis. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction assay were utilized to test the gene expression and methylation status of the p53 and p21 gene promoters. The results showed that 5-Aza differentially inhibited spontaneous proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at S phase in DU145, at G1 phase in 22RV1 and LNCaP cells, and G2 phase in normal RWPE-1 cells, as well as induced the expression of phospho-H2A.X and tumor suppressive mammary serine protease inhibitor (maspin) in all three types of CaP cells. 5-Aza also increased p53 and p21 transcription through promoter demethylation, and decreased the expression of oncogene c-Myc in 22RV1 and LNCaP cells. Western blotting analysis showed that the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage was detected in DU145 and 22RV1 cells. Moreover, there were no significant changes in p53, p21 and c-Myc expression in DU145 cells following treatment with 5-Aza. Thus, in responsible for its apoptotic induction and DNA damage, the mechanism of the antitumor activities of 5-Aza may involve in an increase of tumor suppressive maspin, upregulation of wild type p53-mediated p21 expression and a decrease of oncogene c-Myc level in 22RV1 and LNCaP cells, and enhancing the tumor suppressive maspin expression in DU145 cells. These results enriched our understanding of the multifaceted antitumor activity of 5-Aza, and provided the expression basis of biomarkers for its possible clinical application in prostate cancer.""","""['Huiying Cheng', 'Sijie Tang', 'Xueqi Lian', 'Hong Meng', 'Xiang Gu', 'Jiajia Jiang', 'Xiaohua Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['Integrating the tumor-suppressive activity of Maspin with p53 in retuning the epithelial homeostasis: A working hypothesis and applicable prospects.', 'Promoter Gene Methylation Regulates Clooxygenase-2 Expression in Androgen-Dependent and Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', ""Activation of p53/p21Waf1/Cip1 pathway by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine inhibits cell proliferation, induces pro-apoptotic genes and mitogen-activated protein kinases in human prostate cancer cells."", 'Testis specific Y-like 5: gene expression, methylation and implications for drug sensitivity in prostate carcinoma.', 'CpG island promoter methylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines is associated with methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2.', 'Integrating the tumor-suppressive activity of Maspin with p53 in retuning the epithelial homeostasis: A working hypothesis and applicable prospects.', 'ZFP36 Inhibits Tumor Progression of Human Prostate Cancer by Targeting CDK6 and Oxidative Stress.', 'FAM107A Inactivation Associated with Promoter Methylation Affects Prostate Cancer Progression through the FAK/PI3K/AKT Pathway.', 'Promoter Gene Methylation Regulates Clooxygenase-2 Expression in Androgen-Dependent and Independent Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Platelets also contribute to metastasis via tumor cell-induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA), which in part enhances cancer cell invasion. Moreover, activated platelets secrete stromal derived growth factor-1α (SDF-1α) that can mobilize CSCs via the CXCR4 receptor. However, the potential reciprocal interactions between CSCs and platelets have not been investigated.  Objective:   To characterize the mechanisms behind PCSC-platelet interaction.  Methods:   Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting was utilized to separate DU145 and PC3 PCa cells into CD133+/CD44+, CD133+/CD44-, CD44+/CD133-, and CD133-/CD44- subpopulations and to measure their CXCR4 surface expression. PCa subpopulation TCIPA experiments were performed using aggregometry and immunoblot was used to measure prothrombin. Platelet SDF-1α secretion was measured by ELISA. Modified-Boyden chamber assays were used to assess the role of SDF-1α:CXCR4 pathway in platelet-PCSC interactions.  Results:   DU145 and PC3 expressing both CD133 and CD44 stem cell markers accounted for only small fractions of total cells (DU145: CD133+/CD44+ 3.44 ± 1.45% vs. CD133+/CD44- 1.56 ± 0.45% vs. CD44+/CD133- 68.19 ± 6.25% vs. CD133-/CD44- 20.36 ± 4.51%). However, CD133+ subpopulations induced the greatest amount of aggregation compared to CD44+/CD133- and double-negative DU145, and this aggregation potency of CD133+ PCa cells corresponded with high levels of prothrombin expression. Additionally, CD133+ subpopulations expressed significantly higher level of CXCR4 compared to CD133-/CD44- and CD44+/CD133-. Disruption of SDF-1α:CXCR4 pathway reduced platelet-induced PCSC invasion.  Conclusions:   CD133+/CD44+ and CD133+/CD44- PCSCs have highest platelet aggregation potency, which could be attributed to their increased prothrombin expression.

Cancer stem cells are thought to be associated with PCa relapse. Here, we show that BAZ2A is required for PCa cells with a cancer stem-like state. BAZ2A genomic occupancy in PCa cells coincides with H3K14ac-enriched chromatin regions. This association is mediated by BAZ2A-bromodomain (BAZ2A-BRD) that specifically binds H3K14ac. BAZ2A associates with inactive enhancers marked by H3K14ac and repressing transcription of genes frequently silenced in aggressive and poorly differentiated PCa.

Little is currently known regarding the decision criteria. Knowledge of these could improve the success of treatment in the future.  Objectives:   To identify factors influencing the treatment decision in patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer receiving ADT and to determine the incidence of concomitant disease in both treatment groups.  Methods:   The two-arm, prospective, non-interventional study ""ProComD"" was conducted from September 2014 to June 2019 at 80 study centers in Germany.

We have optimized the radiolabeling protocol for a multidose formulation (27-28.8 GBq equivalent to 6-7 patient-doses) of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 using [177Lu]Lu3+ produced via 176Lu(n,γ)177Lu route with moderate specific activity (0.66-0.81 GBq/μg). Methods: [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was synthesized using moderate specific activity [177Lu]LuCl3 (0.74 GBq/μg) with PSMA-617 having metal-to-ligand molar ratio ∼1: 2.5 in CH3COONH4 buffer (0.1 M) containing gentisic acid at pH 4.0-4.5. Human prostate carcinoma cell line LNCaP cell (high PSMA expression) was used for in vitro cell-binding studies and generating tumor xenograft models in nude mice for tissue biodistribution studies. Several batches of the present formulation have been clinically administered in mCRPC patients (single patient dose: 4.44-5.55 GBq per cycle). Results: In this study we report a consistent and reproducible protocol for multidose formulations of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 for adopting in a hospital radiopharmacy setting. Although the radiochemical yield of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was found to be 97.30% ± 1.03%, the radiochemical purity was 98.24% ± 0.50% (n = 19). In vitro and serum stability of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was retained up to 72 and 120 h after radiolabeling and upon storage at -20°C with a radioactive concentration between 0.37 and 0.74 GBq/mL upon using stabilizer concentration as low as 43-48 μg/mCi. Preclinical cell-binding studies of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 revealed specific binding with LNCaP cells of 17.4% ± 2.4%. The uptake in LnCaP xenografted tumor (nude mice) was 7.5 ± 2.6% ID/g for ∼1.5-2.0 cm3 tumor volume at 24-h post-injection. Post-therapy (24 h) SPECT image of mCRPC patients with prior orchidectomy and various hormone therapy showed specific localization of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in the tumor region. Conclusions: Formulation of a ready-to-use multidose formulation of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was successfully achieved and the procedure was optimized for routine preparation at a hospital radiopharmacy set-up.

Methods:   We generated two novel cell line models (LAPC4-CR and VCaP-CR) which were derived by passaging LAPC4 and VCaP cells in vivo and in vitro under castrate conditions. We performed detailed transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and proteomic analyses (SWATH-MS) to delineate expression differences between castration-sensitive and castration-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, we characterized the in vivo and in vitro growth characteristics of these novel cell line models.  Results:   The two cell line derivatives LAPC4-CR and VCaP-CR showed castration-resistant growth in vitro and in vivo which was only minimally inhibited by AR antagonists, enzalutamide, and bicalutamide. High-dose androgen treatment resulted in significant growth arrest of VCaP-CR but not in LAPC4-CR cells. Both cell lines maintained AR expression, but exhibited distinct expression changes on the mRNA and protein level. Integrated analyses including data from LNCaP and the previously described castration-resistant LNCaP-abl cells revealed an expression signature of castration resistance.

Methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, patients with urological primary cancers and concomitant secondary PCa (diagnosed 2004-2016) were identified and were matched in 1:4 fashion with primary PCa controls. OM was compared between secondary and primary PCa patients and stratified according to primary urological cancer type, as well as to time interval between primary urological cancer versus secondary PCa diagnoses.  Results:   We identified 5,987 patients with primary urological and secondary PCa (bladder, n = 3,287; kidney, n = 2,127; testis, n = 391; upper tract, n = 125; penile, n = 47; urethral, n = 10) versus 531,732 primary PCa patients.

Conversely, proportions of secondary PCa patients which received radical prostatectomy were smaller (29.0 vs. 33.5%), while no local treatment rates were higher (34.2 vs. 26.3%). After 1:4 matching, secondary PCa patients exhibited worse OM than primary PCa patients, except for primary testis cancer. Here, no OM differences were recorded. Finally, subgroup analyses showed that the survival disadvantage of secondary PCa patients decreased with longer time interval since primary cancer diagnosis.

Patients with breast cancer or gynecological malignancies being treated with BPs or those receiving bone-targeted therapy for metastatic prostate cancer are at increased risk of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). Although BPs markedly ameliorate osteoporosis, their adverse effects largely limit the clinical application of these drugs. This study focused on providing a deeper understanding of one of the most popular BPs, the alendronate (ALN)-induced perturbation of the bone proteome and microenvironmental pathophysiology. Methods: To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying ALN-induced side-effects, an unbiased and global proteomics approach combined with big data bioinformatics was applied. This was followed by biochemical and functional analyses to determine the clinicopathological mechanisms affected by ALN. Results: The findings from this proteomics study suggest that the RIPK3/Wnt/GSK3/β-catenin signaling pathway is significantly perturbed upon ALN treatment, resulting in abnormal angiogenesis, inflammation, anabolism, remodeling, and mineralization in bone cells in an in vitro cell culture system.

Many trials have included treatment strategies that incorporate either high or low dose RT, or short-term or long-term ADT (STADT or LTADT), in one or more trial arms. We sought to compare different forms of treatment intensification of RT in the context of localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we collected over 40 phases III clinical trials comparing different forms of RT for localized prostate cancer. We performed a meta-regression of 40 individual trials with 21,429 total patients to allow a comparison of the rates and cumulative proportions of 5-year overall survival (OS), prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and distant metastasis (DM) for each treatment arm of every trial.  Results:   Dose-escalation either in the absence or presence of STADT failed to significantly improve any 5-year outcome. In contrast, adding LTADT to low dose RT significantly improved 5-year PCSM (Odds ratio [OR] 0.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-0.54, p < 0.001) and DM (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.63. p < 0.001) over low dose RT alone. Adding STADT also significantly improved 5-year PCSM over low dose RT alone (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.75, p < 0.001).

Design:   Cross-sectional observational study.  Setting:   A discrete choice experiment was conducted. Patients chose between two hypothetical non-metastatic CRPC (nmCRPC) treatments defined by six attributes: risk of fatigue, falls or fracture, cognitive impairment, hypertension, rashes as side effects to treatment and extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs.  Participants:   A total of 137 adult male patients with CRPC with no prior experience with chemotherapy and with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0-1 were recruited. Patients were excluded if they participated in an investigational programme outside of routine clinical practice, had a clinically relevant medical or psychiatric condition, or diagnosis of visceral/other metastases not related to the prostate, or were otherwise deemed ineligible by the referring physician.  Primary outcome measures:   Relative preference weights and relative importance of the attributes was estimated by hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.  Results:   Among the treatment attributes, 'risk of cognitive impairment as a side effect of treatment' was the most important attribute (relative importance (RI) (95% CI): 27.47% (24.80% to 30.14%)), followed by 'extension of time until cancer-related pain occurs' (RI (95% CI): 17.87% (15.49% to 20.25%)) and the 'risk of falls or fracture' (RI (95% CI): 15.99% (14.73% to 17.25%)).

We aimed to characterize outcomes of African American and Hispanic men undergoing surveillance and to identify factors associated with transition to definitive treatment.  Material and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of men undergoing active surveillance at our institution. Reasons for transition to definitive treatment were determined. Cessation of active surveillance was recommended for Gleason upgrading on surveillance biopsy. We characterized treatment-free survival for men on surveillance and compared this by race/ethnicity (as self reported by patients). Demographic and clinical variables associated with active surveillance cessation were identified using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   A total of 141 men were on active surveillance: 84 non-Hispanic Black/African American (59.6%), 32 Hispanic (22.7%), and 25 non-Hispanic White/Caucasian (17.7%). Two-year treatment-free survival for Caucasian, Black and Hispanic patients was 81.2%, 54.4%, and 75.0%, respectively. Pairwise Cox proportional hazards analysis showed significantly decreased treatment-free survival in Black compared to Caucasian men (HR 2.42, 95% CI 1.03-5.68). In African American men, cessation of active surveillance occurred most commonly due to grade reclassification at the time of confirmatory biopsy.

A study of patient- and lymph node- based analyses""","""Background and aim:   Gallium-68 (68Ga)-Prostate Membrane Specific Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) is an emerging diagnostic modality which is gaining importance in individualized prostate cancer (PCa) management era. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging before radical prostatectomy (RP) in intermediate and high risk PCa.  Materials and methods:   The retrospectively documented 49 patients with intermediate and high risk non-metastatic PCa who had 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT before RP were enrolled into this study. The histopathology of dissected LNs was used as reference standard to evaluate the accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging, both in per-patient (n = 49) and in per-node (n = 454) analyses. The diagnostic accuracy was investigated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and by area under the curve (AUC) provided using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis.  Results:   Median age was 64 (48-79) years and, median and mean PSA values were 10 (1.31-138) ng/ml and 16.2 (±19.8) ng/ml, respectively. 22 (44.9%) and 27 (55.1%) of patients had intermediate and high risk PCa, respectively. A total of 5 (10.2%) patients had histopathologically proven LN metastasis and 3 (60%) of them was detected in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. In per patient analysis, the sensitivity, specifity, PPV and NPV of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging were 0.60, 0.96, 0.60 and 0.96, respectively. Among overall 454 LNs, 16 (3.5 %) of them were reported as metastatic in histopathology and, 13 (2.9%) of these metastatic LNs were detected in 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. In per-node analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT on primary LN staging were 0.82, 0.99, 0.87 and 0.99, respectively. The ROC analyses found AUCs for primary LN staging as 0.777 (95%CI:0.508-1.0) in per patient analysis and, as 0.904 (95%CI:0.790 - 1.0) in per node analysis, respectively.  Conclusion:   The use of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT has promising diagnostic accuracy on primary LN staging before RP in intermediate and high risk PCa.

We also addressed the role of possible mental deterioration, partnership quality, QoL, distress, anxiety, and depression in patients and their spouses.  Methods and material:   This was a cross-sectional non-interventional explorative study. We administered questionnaires to 96 patients with advanced CaPand their spouses. Both patients and their spouses were asked about the influence of the spouses on treatment decision making, if they prefer quality of life or life expectancy as main goal of treatment and the perceived deterioration of the patients' mental abilities. Additional questionnaires were used to assess medical history, partnership, global quality of life, distress, depression, and anxiety. We performed statistical tests to compare patients with spouses and correlations to detect associations between variables.  Results:   The spouses (65 ± 9 years) were significantly younger than the patients (69 ± 9 years). Ninety-five percent of the patients and 91% of the spouses reported that the spouses were involved in making treatment decisions. There was a high similarity within couples with regard to their preference for QoL or LE during treatment. Between couples, this preference differed markedly. Emotional control and motivation were the areas most commonly reported to have deteriorated among patients' mental abilities. The quality of the partnership was rated as being higher than average by both partners. Among the spouses, the quality of partnership correlated significantly with the preference for LE with regard to treatment decision making. Patients and spouses reported high psychological burdens in all areas, with higher levels of distress and anxiety in spouses (P< 0.01). Reduced quality of life and greater distress, depression, and anxiety were significantly correlated with the amount of deterioration of the patients' mental abilities.  Conclusions:   Spouses of patients with advanced CaP seem to respond to different aspects of the disease by adjusting both their involvement in treatment decision making and their preferred goal of treatment. Due to mental deterioration in the patients and pronounced anxiety in their spouses, we suggest that it is important for the attending physician to provide detailed information and support to both partners. Overall, the high-stress situation seems to affect both partners to similar degrees.""","""['Andreas Ihrig', 'Tobias Hanslmeier', 'Carsten Grüllich', 'Stefanie Zschäbitz', 'Johannes Huber', 'Anja Greinacher', 'Christina Sauer', 'Hans-Christoph Friederich', 'Imad Maatouk']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Dyadic effects of coping strategies on emotional state and quality of life in prostate cancer patients and their spouses.', 'Cross-sectional relationships between dyadic coping and anxiety, depression, and relationship satisfaction for patients with prostate cancer and their spouses.', 'Health-related quality of life of advanced prostate cancer patients and spouses: results from actor-partner interdependence models.', 'Choose wisely: therapeutic decisions and quality of life in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness of couple-based interventions for prostate cancer patients and their spouses on their quality of life: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Marital status and perceived stress in men with advanced prostate cancer: A randomized-controlled trial of cognitive behavioral stress management.', '""Partner"", ""Caregiver"", or ""Co-Survivor""-Might the Label We Give the Partners of Cancer Patients Affect the Health Outcome of the Patients and Their Partners?']"""

Objective:   We aimed at developing and validating a novel classification integrating clinical and radiological parameters.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2020 across seven academic international referral centers. A total of 2565 patients treated with RP for PCa were identified.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Early BCR was defined as two prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values of ≥0.2 ng/ml within 3 yr after RP. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regressions tested time and predictors of BCR. Development and validation cohorts were generated from the overall patient sample. A model predicting early BCR based on Cox-derived coefficients represented the basis for a nomogram that was validated externally. Predictors consisted of PSA, biopsy grade group, MRI stage, and the maximum diameter of lesion at MRI. Novel risk categories were then identified. The Harrel's concordance index (c-index) compared the accuracy of our risk stratification with the European Association of Urology (EAU), Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA), and International Staging Collaboration for Cancer of the Prostate (STAR-CAP) risk groups in predicting early BCR.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 200 (8%), 1834 (71%), and 531 (21%) had low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease according to the EAU risk groups. The 3-yr overall BCR-free survival rate was 84%. No differences were observed in the 3-yr BCR-free survival between EAU low- and intermediate-risk groups (88% vs 87%; p = 0.1). The novel nomogram depicted optimal discrimination at external validation (c-index 78%). Four new risk categories were identified based on the predictors included in the Cox-based nomogram. This new risk classification had higher accuracy in predicting early BCR (c-index 70%) than the EAU, CAPRA, and STAR-CAP risk classifications (c-index 64%, 63%, and 67%, respectively).  Conclusions:   We developed and externally validated four novel categories based on clinical and radiological parameters to predict early BCR. This novel classification exhibited higher accuracy than the available tools.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential uncertainty of gold fiducial marker (GFM) registration for localized prostate cancer and to estimate the inter-observer bias in a clinical setting.  Methods:   Four experienced observers registered CT and MR images for 42 prostate cancer patients. Manual GFM identification was followed by a landmark-based registration. The absolute difference between observers in GFM identification and the displacement of the clinical target volume (CTV) was investigated. The CTV center of mass (CoM) vector displacements, DICE-index and Hausdorff distances for the observer registrations were compared against a clinical baseline registration. The time allocated for the manual registrations was compared.  Results:   Absolute difference in GFM identification between observers ranged from 0.0 to 3.0 mm. The maximum CTV CoM displacement from the clinical baseline was 3.1 mm. Displacements larger than or equal to 1 mm, 2 mm and 3 mm were 46%, 18% and 4%, respectively. No statistically significant difference was detected between observers in terms of CTV displacement. Median DICE-index and Hausdorff distance for the CTV, with their respective ranges were 0.94 [0.70-1.00] and 2.5 mm [0.7-8.7].  Conclusions:   Registration of CT and MR images using GFMs for localized prostate cancer patients was subject to inter-observer bias on an individual patient level. A CTV displacement as large as 3 mm occurred for individual patients. These results show that GFM registration in a clinical setting is associated with uncertainties, which motivates the removal of inter-modality registrations in the radiotherapy workflow and a transition to an MRI-only workflow for localized prostate cancer.""","""['Emilia Persson', 'Sevgi Emin', 'Jonas Scherman', 'Christian Jamtheim Gustafsson', 'Patrik Brynolfsson', 'Sofie Ceberg', 'Adalsteinn Gunnlaugsson', 'Lars E Olsson']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Using C-Arm X-ray images from marker insertion to confirm the gold fiducial marker identification in an MRI-only prostate radiotherapy workflow.', 'Accuracy of an MR-only workflow for prostate radiotherapy using semi-automatically burned-in fiducial markers.', 'Registration free automatic identification of gold fiducial markers in MRI target delineation images for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in the radiation treatment planning of localized prostate cancer using intra-prostatic fiducial markers for computed tomography co-registration.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'Geometric impact and dose estimation of on-patient placement of a lightweight receiver coil in a clinical magnetic resonance imaging-only radiotherapy workflow for prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided vs Computed Tomography-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: The MIRAGE Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'MRI-only radiotherapy from an economic perspective: Can new techniques in prostate cancer treatment be cost saving?', 'The future of MRI in radiation therapy: Challenges and opportunities for the MR community.']"""

Further analysis including external and internal verification indicated that the patients with high riskScores had shorter time to BCR compared to those with low riskScores in both TCGA and GSE116918. The area under the curve (AUC) of the time-dependent receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) of the predictive model exhibited a good predictive performance. The signature was also proven to be a valuable independent prognostic factor (all P < 0.05). We also established a nomogram based on the 13 RBPs to visualize the relationships between individual predictors and 1-, 3- and 5-year BCR for PCA.  Conclusions:   Our results successfully screened out 13 RBPs as a robust BCR-predictive signature in PCA by external and internal verification, helping clinician predict patients' cancer progression status and promoting the specific individualized treatment than original clinical parameters.""","""['Qianwei Xing', 'Shouyong Liu', 'Jiaochen Luan', 'Yi Wang', 'Limin Ma']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Gene signatures predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in primary prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'A Novel Set of Immune-associated Gene Signature predicts Biochemical Recurrence in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Construction and Validation of a Robust Cancer Stem Cell-Associated Gene Set-Based Signature to Predict Early Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'ZNF154 is a promising diagnosis biomarker and predicts biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Development and Validation of an Individualized Immune Prognostic Signature for Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Developing an m5C regulator-mediated RNA methylation modification signature to predict prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy in rectal cancer.', 'Identification and verification of feature biomarkers associated with immune cells in neonatal sepsis.', 'Systematic Analysis of Tumor Microenvironment Patterns and Oxidative Stress Characteristics of Endometrial Carcinoma Mediated by 5-Methylcytosine Regulators.', '5-methylcytosine RNA methyltransferases and their potential roles in cancer.', 'Recognition of a Novel Gene Signature for Human Glioblastoma.']"""

Previous studies identified several risk factors for late radiation toxicity, including both dose-volume factors and genetic predisposition. Herein, we investigated the contribution of genetic predisposition, particularly compared with dose-volume factors, to the risk of late radiation toxicity in patients treated with highly conformal radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   We included 179 patients with prostate cancer who underwent treatment with curative external beam radiation therapy between 2009 and 2013. Toxicity was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Transcriptional responsiveness of homologous recombination repair genes and γ-H2AX foci decay ratios (FDRs) were determined in ex vivo irradiated lymphocytes in a previous analysis. Dose-volume parameters were retrieved by delineating the organs at risk (OARs) on CT planning images. Associations between risk factors and grade ≥2 urinary and bowel late radiation toxicities were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. The analyses were performed using the highest toxicity grade recorded during the follow-up per patient.  Results:   The median follow-up period was 31 months. One hundred and one patients (56%) developed grade ≥2 late radiation toxicity. Cumulative rates for urinary and bowel grade ≥2 late toxicities were 46% and 17%, respectively. In the multivariable analysis, factors significantly associated with grade ≥2 late toxicity were transurethral resection of the prostate (P = .013), γ-H2AX FDR <3.41 (P = .008), and rectum V70 >11.52% (P = .017).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that impaired DNA double-strand break repair in lymphocytes, as quantified by γ-H2AX FDR, is the most critical determining factor of late radiation toxicity. The limited influence of dose-volume parameters could be due to the use of increasingly conformal techniques, leading to improved dose-volume parameters of the organs at risk.""","""['Anna C Nuijens', 'Arlene L Oei', 'Bregje van Oorschot', 'Jorrit Visser', 'Rob M van Os', 'Perry D Moerland', 'Nicolaas A P Franken', 'Coen R N Rasch', 'Lukas J A Stalpers']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Prostate Cancer Patients with Late Radiation Toxicity Exhibit Reduced Expression of Genes Involved in DNA Double-Strand Break Repair and Homologous Recombination.', 'Grading-system-dependent volume effects for late radiation-induced rectal toxicity after curative radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary report of toxicity following 3D radiation therapy for prostate cancer on 3DOG/RTOG 9406.', 'Reduced activity of double-strand break repair genes in prostate cancer patients with late normal tissue radiation toxicity.', 'Dose-volume analysis of predictors for chronic rectal toxicity after treatment of prostate cancer with adaptive image-guided radiotherapy.', 'A Comparison between Patient- and Physician-Reported Late Radiation Toxicity in Long-Term Prostate Cancer Survivors.']"""

We aimed to analyze whether PC incidence increased in TPL patients with subsequent use of immunosuppressants using the Korean National Health Insurance Database.  Methods:   TPL patients between 2003 and 2015(N = 12,970) were age- and year-matched to non-TPL patients (N = 38,910) in a 1:3 ratio. Multivariate Cox regression analysis adjusted for significant prognostic clinicopathological parameters, including the duration of immunosuppressant agent use (0-300 or > 300 days), and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test were used to evaluate the association of TPL with PC incidence between the groups.  Results:   Median overall survival was 4.86 years; overall mortality rate was 3.4% (n = 1761). Regardless of differences in baseline characteristics between the groups, multivariate analysis for PC incidence showed that age, immunosuppressant use, and TPL organ subtypes were significant factors for the overall population, whereas only age was significant in the TPL group (p < 0.05). After adjusting for age, underlying disease, and prescribed medication (aspirin, statin), multiple subgroup analysis models for PC incidence were evaluated. PC incidence was increased in the TPL group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.965, p < 0.001); however, PC incidence in the TPL group became insignificant after adjusting for immunosuppressant use (p = 0.194). Kaplan-Meier curves also showed that PC incidence was significantly different according to age and TPL with the use of immunosuppressants between the TPL and non-TPL groups.

However, in the Shiga Prefecture, only a single city performed PSA screening over the time period of this survey. The purpose of the present study was to determine the clinical, pathological, and therapeutic features of newly diagnosed prostate cancer in localities where a formally organized screening system was almost entirely absent.  Methods:   A multicenter observational study was conducted in the Shiga Prefecture, which has the lowest rate of population-based PSA-screening in Japan.

We stratified patients according to the reasons for PSA measurement, and compared the differences between groups subject to organized versus opportunistic screening.  Results:   In the 2 years 2012 and 2017, 984 newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients were analyzed. Of these, 954 (97%) were opportunistically tested (i.e., not as part of an organized screening system), with the remaining 29 (3%) measured as part of an organized screening program. Patients in the former group exhibited a higher initial PSA value than in the organized screening group (median: 11.49 vs. 5.67 ng/ml). They also had worse clinical features, including higher Gleason score and TNM stage. More patients in the organized screening group were treated curatively than in the nonorganized screening group in terms of the primary treatment.

The objective of this paper is to describe a deep-learning-based framework for fully automated detection of PCa in the TZ using T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images.  Method:   This was a single-center IRB-approved cross-sectional study of men undergoing 3T MRI on two systems. The dataset consisted of 196 patients (103 with and 93 without clinically significant [Grade Group 2 or higher] TZ PCa) to train and test our proposed methodology, with an additional 168 patients with peripheral zone PCa used only for training. We proposed an ensemble of classifiers in which multiple U-Net-based models are designed for prediction of TZ PCa location on ADC map MR images, with initial automated segmentation of the prostate to guide detection. We compared accuracy of ADC alone to T2W and combined ADC+T2W MRI for input images, and investigated improvements using ensembles over their constituent models with different methods of diversity in individual models by hyperparameter configuration, loss function and model architecture.  Results:   Our developed algorithm reported sensitivity and precision of 0.829 and 0.617 in 56 test cases containing 31 instances of TZ PCa and in 25 patients without clinically significant TZ tumors. Patient-wise classification accuracy had an area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.974.

In short, PI-RADS 1-2 was generally not biopsied and PI-RADS 3-5 was reviewed by a multidisciplinary team. Patients with PI-RADS 4-5 were all referred to biopsy, either transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy or MRI in-bore biopsy for small tumors and for sites difficult to access. PI-RADS scores were compared to the histopathology from biopsies and surgical specimens for patients who had prostatectomy. Non-biopsied patients were referred to a safety net monitoring regimen.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility of B7-H3 or HHLA2 as alternative immunotherapeutic targets in PCa.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate the expression pattern of PD-L1, B7-H3 and HHLA2 and the infiltration of CD8+ and Foxp3+ lymphocytes in 239 PCa tissues from two independent cohorts. The correlations between B7-H3 and HHLA2 and clinicopathological features, including the presence of CD8+ and Foxp3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), were explored.  Results:   HHLA2 expression was much higher than PD-L1 expression but lower than B7-H3 expression in PCa tissues. High expression of both B7-H3 and HHLA2 was significantly associated with higher Gleason score and tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and dismal overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Moreover, a high B7 score, defined as high B7-H3 expression and/or high HHLA2 expression, was an independent prognostic predictor for PCa. Of note, a high B7 score was negatively correlated with CD8+ TILs. Importantly, a new immune classification, based on the B7 score and CD8+ TILs, successfully stratified OS and CSS in PCa.  Conclusions:   Both B7-H3 and HHLA2 have a critical impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment, and the B7 score could be used as an independent prognostic factor for PCa. The B7 score combined with CD8+ TILs could be used as a new immune classification to stratify the risk of death, especially cancer-related death, for patients with PCa. These findings may provide insights that could improve response to immune-related comprehensive therapy for PCa in the future.""","""['Qianghua Zhou#', 'Kaiwen Li#', 'Yiming Lai#', 'Kai Yao#', 'Qiong Wang', 'Xiangyu Zhan', 'Shirong Peng', 'Wenli Cai', 'Wei Yao', 'Xingxing Zang', 'Kewei Xu', 'Jian Huang', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Novel immune scoring dynamic nomograms based on B7-H3, B7-H4, and HHLA2: Potential prediction in survival and immunotherapeutic efficacy for gallbladder cancer.', 'HHLA2 in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: an immune checkpoint with prognostic significance and wider expression compared with PD-L1.', 'Prognostic values of B7-H3, B7-H4, and HHLA2 expression in human pancreatic cancer tissues based on mIHC and spatial distribution analysis.', 'HHLA2 immune-regulatory roles in cancer.', 'B7-H3 immunoregulatory roles in cancer.', 'TSPAN18 facilitates bone metastasis of prostate cancer by protecting STIM1 from TRIM32-mediated ubiquitination.', 'Targeting B7-H3-A Novel Strategy for the Design of Anticancer Agents for Extracranial Pediatric Solid Tumors Treatment.', 'Recent advancements in the B7/CD28 immune checkpoint families: new biology and clinical therapeutic strategies.', 'Immune checkpoint of B7-H3 in cancer: from immunology to clinical immunotherapy.', 'Novel immune scoring dynamic nomograms based on B7-H3, B7-H4, and HHLA2: Potential prediction in survival and immunotherapeutic efficacy for gallbladder cancer.']"""

Whether brachytherapy boost technique, specifically low-dose-rate (LDR-BT) versus high-dose-rate (HDR-BT), impacts treatment-related toxicity is unclear.  Methods:   Between 2012-2018, 106 men with intermediate/high risk PCa underwent EBRT (37.5-45 Gy in 1.8-2.5 Gy/fraction) plus brachytherapy boost, either with LDR-BT (110 Gy I-125 or 100 Gy Pd-103; n = 51) or HDR-BT (15 Gy x1 Ir-192; n = 55). Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) were assessed by International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-CP) surveys at 3-6-month intervals for up to three years following treatment, with higher scores indicating more severe toxicity. Provider-reported GU and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was graded per CTCAE v5.0 at each follow-up. Linear mixed models comparing PROs between LDR-BT versus HDR-BT were fitted. Stepwise multivariable analysis (MVA) was performed to account for age, gland size, androgen deprivation therapy use, and alpha-blocker medication use. Incidence rates of grade 2+ GU/GI toxicity was compared using Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Use of LDR-BT was associated with greater change in IPSS (p=0.003) and EPIC-CP urinary irritative score (p = 0.002) compared with HDR-BT, but effect size diminished over time (LDR-BT versus HDR-BT: baseline to 6-/24-month mean IPSS change, +6.4/+1.4 versus +2.7/-3.0, respectively; mean EPIC-CP irritative/obstructive change, +2.5/+0.1 versus +0.9/+0.1, respectively). Results remained significant on MVA. Post-treatment grade 2+ GU toxicity was significantly higher in the LDR-BT group (67.5% versus 42.9% for LDR-BT and HDR-BT, respectively; p <0.001). There were no differences between groups in incontinence, bowel function, and erectile function, or grade 2+ GI toxicity.

Materials and methods:   A literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar was performed to identify relevant studies from January 2012 to December 2020. We included diagnostic accuracy studies using ESUR scoring system for detection of EPE, and with prostatectomy histopathological results as the reference standard.

To overcome the low water solubility of the Cu(TPZ)2, a remote loading method was developed to efficiently load the lipophilic complex into different liposomal formulations. The effect of pH, temperature, PEGylation, lipid composition, liposome size, lipid: complex ratio on the liposome properties, and drug loading was evaluated. The highest loading efficiency was obtained at neutral pH, which was independent of lipid composition and incubation time. In addition, enhanced drug loading was achieved upon decreasing the lipid:complex molar ratio with minimal effects on liposomes' morphology. Interestingly, the in vitro potency of the developed liposomes was easily manipulated by changing the lipid composition. The hydrophilic nature of our liposomal formulations improved the complex's solubility, leading to enhanced cellular uptake and toxicity, both in PCa monolayers and tumour spheroids. Moreover, Cu(TPZ)2-loaded liposomes combined with radiation, showed a significant reduction in PCa spheroids growth rate, compared to the free complex or radiation alone, which could potentiate radiotherapy in patients with localised advanced PCa.""","""['Vera L Silva', 'Amalia Ruiz', 'Ahlam Ali', 'Sara Pereira', 'Jani Seitsonen', 'Janne Ruokolainen', 'Fiona Furlong', 'Jonathan Coulter', ""Wafa' T Al-Jamal""]""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Pharm""","""['Enhanced selectivity, cellular uptake, and in vitro activity of an intrinsically fluorescent copper-tirapazamine nanocomplex for hypoxia targeted therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Near-infrared light triggered liposomes combining photodynamic and chemotherapy for synergistic breast tumor therapy.', 'Tirapazamine-loaded CalliSpheres microspheres enhance synergy between tirapazamine and embolization against liver cancer in an animal model.', 'Hypoxic sensitizer and cytotoxin for head and neck cancer.', 'Tirapazamine: prototype for a novel class of therapeutic agents targeting tumor hypoxia.', ""Let's Go 3D!

This assumption is unrealistic in tumors with copy-number aberrations that alter SNV multiplicities. Furthermore, the CCF does not account for SNV losses due to copy-number aberrations, confounding downstream phylogenetic analyses. We introduce DeCiFer, an algorithm that overcomes these limitations by clustering SNVs using a novel statistic, the descendant cell fraction (DCF). The DCF quantifies both the prevalence of an SNV at the present time and its past evolutionary history using an evolutionary model that allows mutation losses.

Consequently, it can cause lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and bladder outlet obstruction symptoms that may substantially reduce a patient's quality of life. Several treatments are available for BPH, including medications such as α-blockers and 5α-reductase inhibitors and surgical options including transurethral resection of the prostate and prostatectomy. Recently, prostatic artery embolization (PAE) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for selected men with BPH and moderate to severe LUTS. Adequate pre- and postprocedural evaluations with clinical examinations and questionnaires, laboratory tests, and urodynamic and imaging examinations (particularly US, MRI, and CT) are of key importance to achieve successful treatment. Considering that the use of PAE has been increasing in tertiary hospital facilities, radiologists and interventional radiologists should be aware of the main technical concepts of PAE and the key features to address in imaging reports in pre- and postprocedural settings.

The aim was to investigate the care in the last three months of life (end-of-life [EOL]) in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods: Castration-resistant prostate cancer registry (CAPRI) is an investigator-initiated, observational multicenter cohort study in 20 hospitals retrospectively including patients diagnosed with CRPC between 2010 and 2016. High-intensity care was defined as the initiation of life-prolonging drugs (LPDs) in the last month, continuation of LPD in last 14 days, >1 admission, admission duration ≥14 days, and/or intensive care admission in last three months of life. Descriptive and binary logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: High-intensity care was experienced by 41% of 2429 patients in the EOL period. Multivariable analysis showed that age (odds ratio [OR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.97-0.99), performance status (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.97), time from CRPC to EOL (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.98), referral to a medical oncologist (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.55-2.55), prior LPD treatment (>1 line OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.31-2.28), and opioid use (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.08-1.95) were significantly associated with high-intensity care.

We evaluated the characteristics of tomotherapy plans with the tumor-tracking system and compared them with cyberknife SBRT plans for localized prostate cancer using a hydrogel spacer.  Methods:   In 20 patients, two plans were created and compared using tomotherapy and cyberknife. All patients underwent hydrogel spacer injection behind the prostate before simulation CT and MRI for fusion. For all plans, 36.25 Gy in 7.25-Gy fractions for a minimum coverage dose of 95% of planning target volume (PTV) (D95%) was prescribed. The D99% of PTV and D0.1 ml of the PTV, urethra, bladder, and rectum were intended to be > 90%, 110-130%, 100-110%, <110%, and <100%, respectively, of the prescribed doses.  Results:   All plans using tomotherapy and cyberknife achieved the intended dose constraints. The cyberknife plans yielded better median PTV-V110% (volume of PTV covered by 110% isodose line, 54.8%), maintaining lower median D0.1 ml of the urethra (37.5 Gy) and V80% of the bladder (11.0 ml) compared to the tomotherapy plans (39.0%; p < 0.0001, 38.2 Gy; p < 0.0001, and 18.3 ml; p < 0.0001, respectively).

Repeatedly sampling the same tumor increases the statistical power of DEG analysis, which is indispensable toward downstream analysis and also increases one's understanding of within-tumor variance, which may affect conclusions. Here, we compared five different methods for analyzing gene expression profiles derived from repeated sampling of human prostate tumors in two separate cohorts of patients. We also benchmarked the sensitivity of generalized linear models to linear mixed models for identifying DEGs contributing to relevant prostate cancer pathways based on a ground-truth model.""","""['Anson T Ku', 'Scott Wilkinson', 'Adam G Sowalsky']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Brief Bioinform""","""['Single-cell transcriptomics in cancer: computational challenges and opportunities.', 'Single-Cell Transcriptomic Analysis of Tumor Heterogeneity.', 'An RNA-Seq-Based Framework for Characterizing Canine Prostate Cancer and Prioritizing Clinically Relevant Biomarker Candidate Genes.', 'BALLI: Bartlett-adjusted likelihood-based linear model approach for identifying differentially expressed genes with RNA-seq data.', 'Gene expression signatures of neuroendocrine prostate cancer and primary small cell prostatic carcinoma.', 'Defining cellular population dynamics at single-cell resolution during prostate cancer progression.']"""

Decreasing androgen can alter lipid metabolism, so the prognostic value of BMI may change in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receiving abiraterone. We aimed to delineate the prognostic value of BMI, serum albumin, and BMI and serum albumin (ALB) combined.  Materials and methods:   A post hoc analysis was performed on data from two randomized clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of abiraterone in chemotherapy-pretreated and -naïve mCRPC patients. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods.  Results:   A total of 2,205 mCRPC patients were included in this study. Low ALB independently predicted the OS in both cohorts (HR, 1.54; 95%CI, 1.34-1.78 and HR, 1.40; 95%CI, 1.21-1.64, respectively), while low BMI independently predicted the OS only in the post-chemotherapy cohort (HR, 1.30; 95%CI, 1.12-1.50) but not in the pre-chemotherapy cohort (HR, 1.19; 95%CI, 0.98-1.43). By combining BMI (<25 kg/m2 or ≥30 kg/m2 ) and ALB (<4 g/dl or >4 g/dl), the four groups were characterized and their HRs were 1, 0.60 (95%CI, 0.47-0.76, p < 0.001), 0.75 (95%CI,0.61-0.92 p = 0.006), and 0.49 (95%CI, 0.41-0.60, p < 0.001) in post-chemotherapy patients and 1, 0.64 (95%CI, 0.46-0.89, p = 0.008), 0.75 (95%CI,0.58-0.98 p = 0.034), and 0.55 (95%CI, 0.42-0.72, p < 0.001) in chemotherapy-naïve patients, respectively.

Methods:   Based on the inclusion criteria of CRPC in EAU guidelines, all eligible patients treated in our hospital from January 2015 to December 2019 were included. Cases underwent radical prostatectomy, docetaxel-based chemotherapy, or new endocrine therapies (including Enza or abiraterone), and cases with severe cardiopulmonary disease or other malignant tumors were excluded. After immunohistochemical staining for CXCR7 expression in prostatic biopsy tissues, all enrolled cases were divided into two groups, namely, the CXCR7-positive group and the CXCR7-negative group. And then, PSA response to Enza treatment was recorded in detail and comparatively analyzed. In addition, the Cox proportional hazard modeling and the Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to determine PSA progression-free survival (PSAP-FS) and clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (CRP-FS) in this cohort.  Results:   A total of 79 CRPC individuals were enrolled and evaluated in this study. Median follow-up durations were 24 months (range, 12-42) in the CXCR7-positive group (n = 47) and 28.5 months (range, 12-42) in the CXCR7-negative group (n = 32). The patients with lower CXCR7 expression showed much better PSA response to Enza treatment. There was 84.4% of CXCR7- cases showing decreasing PSA response, while there were 71.4% in the CXCR7/1+ group and 31.2% in the CXCR7/2+ group, respectively. All patients in the CXCR7/3+ group showed increasing PSA response to Enza treatment. And the percentage of patients whose PSA decreased over 50% is significantly higher in the CXCR7-negative group than in the CXCR7-positive group (68.8% vs. 8.5%, P < 0.001), and the percentage of patients whose PSA decreased over 90% is also remarkably higher in the CXCR7-negative group (43.8% vs. 0, P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the oncologic outcomes of CXCR7-negative patients were improved much significantly by Enza treatment in comparison with those of CXCR7-positive patients. Significantly increased median PSAP-FS (21 months vs. 6 months, P < 0.0001) and CRP-FS (27 months vs. 9 months, P < 0.0001) were obtained in the CXCR7-negative group. The further stratified analysis in all CXCR7-positive patients demonstrated that the patients with higher CXCR7 expression showed much worse outcome. The median time of PSAP-FS was 21 months in the CXCR7/1+ group, 9 months in the CXCR7/2+ group, and 6 months in the CXCR7/3+ group, while the median time of CRP-FS was 21 months in the CXCR7/1+ group, 12 months in the CXCR7/2+ group, and 6 months in the CXCR7/3+ group, respectively.

In this paper, we mainly studied the role of miR-1826 in prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   The expression of miR-1826 was studied by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Kaplan-Meier curves were used to analyze the relationship between the expression of miR-1826 and the survival rate of PC patients. Cox regression analysis was used to study the risk factors affecting the prognosis of PC patients. PC cells were transfected with miR-1826 mimic, mimic negative control (mimic NC), miR-1826 inhibitor, or inhibitor NC. The effect of miR-1826 on the proliferation of PC cells was studied by the CCK-8 method and colony formation assay. Transwell assays were used to detect the effect of miR-1826 on the migratory and invasive abilities of tumor cells.  Results:   The expression of miR-1826 in PC tissues was lower than that in adjacent normal tissues, and that the expression levels of miR-1826 in four PC cell lines were all lower than normal human prostate epithelial cell lines. Patients with low expression of miR-1826 had shorter overall survival compared with those with high expression. The downregulation of miR-1826 promoted PC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

We developed a quantitative high-throughput screen to identify efficacious agents against SARS-CoV-2. From a library of 1,425 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved compounds and clinical candidates, we identified 17 hits that inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection and analyzed their antiviral activity across multiple cell lines, including lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP) cells and a physiologically relevant model of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells (iAEC2s). Additionally, we found that inhibitors of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Notably, we discovered that lactoferrin, a glycoprotein found in secretory fluids including mammalian milk, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection in the nanomolar range in all cell models with multiple modes of action, including blockage of virus attachment to cellular heparan sulfate and enhancement of interferon responses.

Methods: Imaging reports and patient demographic data were retrospectively reviewed from 663 clinical 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT studies, performed in 601 patients for the assessment of their prostate cancer (643 - recurrence evaluation, 20 - initial staging) from August 2016 to April 2021. Maximum SUV (SUVmax) of the suspected second neoplasms was determined. The results of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT were correlated with clinical and radiologic studies to determine the nature of the suspected second neoplasms. Results: Fifty-five patients (9.1%) had findings suggestive of a second neoplasm. Thirty-nine of 55 had a known second neoplasm diagnosed before the PET/CT. An incidental second primary neoplasm was first suspected on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT in 16 of 601 patients (2.7%). Three of the 16 patients had PET/CT suggestive of a meningioma that was corroborated on MRI. Of the remaining 13 patients, 11 had a tissue diagnosis confirming a malignancy. Second malignancies included renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 5/11; 45.5%), urothelial carcinoma (n = 2), multiple myeloma, chondrosarcoma, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and lung (n = 1, each; except for 1 patient with both esophageal and lung carcinomas). Among histopathologically confirmed malignancies, clear-cell RCC had the lowest uptake (SUVmax 3.4), and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma had the highest uptake (SUVmax 13.6). Of the 2 patients with no histopathologic confirmation, 1 had ultrasound and MRI findings corroborating the diagnosis of RCC. The other patient had a solitary lung nodule suggestive of primary lung carcinoma and elected to undergo observation. Conclusion: Incidental findings consistent with a second primary neoplasm are not infrequently seen on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT performed for assessment of prostate cancer (9.1%).

The Cochran-Armitage test was used for AS trend over time. Treatment-free survival was estimated using cumulative incidence function. Factors associated with discontinuation of AS were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Active surveillance was the initial management strategy for 8,541 cases (51%). Use of AS significantly increased from 38% in 2008 to 69% in 2014 (p=0.001). Men on AS were significantly older (64 years, SD 8.0) than those on initial treatment (62 years, SD 7.7; p=0.001). After a median followup of 48 months, 4,337 (51%) patients had discontinued AS. Treatment-free survival for AS patients at 1, 3, and 5 years were 85%, 58% and 52%, respectively. Median time to definitive treatment after initial AS was 16 months (IQR 11-25 months). Factors associated with AS discontinuation were younger age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, higher comorbidities, treatment at academic center, treatment by physician and institution in the highest volume tertile, and adverse cancer-specific characteristics (higher prostate specific antigen [PSA], higher number of positive cores and higher percentage of core involvement at diagnosis).  Conclusions:   Although the uptake of AS significantly increased over time, there has been a relatively high rate of discontinuation over 5 years. Factors associated with transition to definitive treatment were younger age, care provided by higher volume physicians and institutions, higher PSA and greater PC volume at diagnosis. These results may help guide policy making, developing quality indicators, and developing targeted continued education for physician and patients embarking on AS to establish realistic expectations.""","""['N Timilshina', 'M Komisarenko', 'L J Martin', 'D C Cheung', 'S Alibhai', 'P O Richard', 'A Finelli']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Assessing the relationship between statin use and oncologic outcomes among men electing active surveillance for localized prostate cancer.', 'The Long-Term Risks of Metastases in Men on Active Surveillance for Early Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors Associated with Time to Conversion from Active Surveillance to Treatment for Prostate Cancer in a Multi-Institutional Cohort.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Comparison of treatment costs for primary localized prostate cancer in Austria and Vienna: an economic analysis.', 'Pilot Study on the Impact of a Home-Based Exercise Program on Inflammatory Cytokines and Quality of Life in Men with Prostate Cancer Under Active Surveillance.', 'Five-Year Prospective Observational Study of African-American Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer Demonstrates Race Is Not Predictive of Oncologic Outcomes.', 'Association Between a 22-feature Genomic Classifier and Biopsy Gleason Upgrade During Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Objective:   The aim of the study was to evaluate the Prostate Health Index (PHI) density (PHID) in comparison with PHI in a large Caucasian group >1,000 men.  Methods:   PHID values were used from available patient data with PSA, free PSA, and [-2]pro-PSA and prostate volume from 3 former surveys from 2002 to 2014. Those 1,446 patients from a single-center cohort included 701 men with PCa and 745 with no PCa. All patients received initial or repeat biopsies. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves comparing area under the ROC curves (AUCs), precision-recall approach, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   PHID medians differed almost 2-fold between PCa (1.12) and no PCa (0.62) in comparison to PHI (48.6 vs. 33; p always <0.0001). However, PHID and PHI were equal regarding the AUC (0.737 vs. 0.749; p = 0.226), and the curves of the precision-recall analysis also overlapped in the sensitivity range between 70 and 100%. DCA had a maximum net benefit of only ∼5% for PHID versus PHI between 45 and 55% threshold probability. Contrary, in the 689 men with a prostate volume ≤40 cm3, PHI (AUC 0.732) showed a significant larger AUC than PHID (AUC 0.69, p = 0.014).  Conclusions:   Based on DCA, PHID had only a small advantage in comparison with PHI alone, while ROC analysis and precision-recall analysis showed similar results. In smaller prostates, PHI even outperformed PHID. The increment for PHID in this large Caucasian cohort is too small to justify a routine clinical use.""","""['Robert Peters', 'Carsten Stephan', 'Klaus Jung', 'Michael Lein', 'Frank Friedersdorff', 'Andreas Maxeiner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['PHI density prospectively improves prostate cancer detection.', 'Combining Prostate Health Index density, magnetic resonance imaging and prior negative biopsy status to improve the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Use of the Prostate Health Index and Density in 3 Outpatient Centers to Avoid Unnecessary Prostate Biopsies.', 'Prostate Health Index Density Outperforms Prostate Health Index in Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Comparison of Prostate-Specific Antigen and Its Density and Prostate Health Index and Its Density for Detection of Prostate Cancer.', 'A prospective study of the prostate health index density and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Comparisons of the diagnostic accuracy across prostate health index, prostate health index density, and percentage free prostate-specific antigen for clinically significant prostate cancer: a prospective diagnostic study.', 'Development of a novel nomogram for predicting clinically significant prostate cancer with the prostate health index and multiparametric MRI.', 'Vitamin D Metabolites in Nonmetastatic High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients with and without Zoledronic Acid Treatment after Prostatectomy.']"""

It investigates the range uncertainties from both CT HU to relative stopping power conversion and patient positioning errors for prostate treatment using pelvic-like biological phantoms. Three 25 × 14 × 12 cm3phantoms, made of fresh animal tissues mimicking the pelvic anatomies of prostate patients, were scanned with a general electric CT simulator. A 22 cm circular passive scattering beam with 29 cm range and 8 cm modulation width was used to measure the water equivalent path lengths (WEPL) through the phantoms at multiple points using the dose extinction method with a MatriXXPT detector. The measured WEPLs were compared to those predicted by TOPAS simulations and ray-tracing WEPL calculations. For the three phantoms, the WEPL differences between measured and theoretical prediction (WDMT) are below 1.8% for TOPAS, and 2.5% for ray-tracing. WDMT varies with phantom anatomies by about 0.5% for both TOPAS and ray-tracing. WDMT also correlates with the tissue types of a specific treated region. For the regions where the proton beam path is parallel to sharp bone edges, the WDMTs of TOPAS and ray-tracing respectively reach up to 1.8% and 2.5%. For the region where proton beams pass through just soft tissues, the WDMT is mostly less than 1% for both TOPAS and ray-tracing. For prostate treatments, range uncertainty depends on the tissue types within a specific treated region, patient anatomies and the range calculation methods in the planning algorithms. Our study indicates range uncertainty is less than 2.5% for the whole treated region with both ray-tracing and TOPAS, which suggests the potential to reduce the current 3.5% range uncertainty margin used in the clinics by at least 1% even for single-energy CT data.""","""['Wencheng Shao', 'Yunhe Xie', 'Jianan Wu', 'Liyan Zhang', 'Schuemann Jan', 'Hsiao-Ming Lu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Validation of an in-vivo proton beam range check method in an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom using dose measurements.', 'openPR - A computational tool for CT conversion assessment with proton radiography.', 'Using CBCT for pretreatment range check in proton therapy: a phantom study for prostate treatment by anterior-posterior beam.', 'Feasibility of energy-resolved dose imaging technique in pencil beam scanning mode.', 'Range uncertainties in proton therapy and the role of Monte Carlo simulations.']"""

Interestingly, FX-9 shows no hemolytic activity and low toxicity in benign adherent cells. The detailed FX-9 molecular mode of action is currently not fully understood. But application on neoplastic cells induces pro-apoptotic and antimitotic effects. Canine prostate cancer (cPC) represents a unique spontaneous occurring animal model for human androgen-independent PC. Human androgen-independent PC as well as cPC are currently not satisfactorily treatable with chemotherapeutic protocols. Accordingly, the evaluation of novel agent combinations bears significant potential for identifying novel treatment strategies. In this study, we combined FX-9 with the currently approved therapeutic agents doxorubicin, carboplatin, the demethylating substance azacitidine as well as further potentially antitumorigenic agents such as dichloroacetic acid (DCA) in order to evaluate the respective synergistic potential. The combinations with 1-5 μM FX-9 were evaluated regarding the effect after 72 hours on cell viability, cell count and apoptotic/necrotic cells in two human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, PC-3) and a canine prostate cancer cell line (Adcarc1258) representing androgen-dependent and -independent PC/cPC forms. FX-9 in combination with azacitidine decreases cell viability and increases cell death with positive Bliss values. Furthermore, this decreases the cell count with neutral Bliss values on PC-3. Carboplatin in combination with FX-9 reduces cell viability with a neutral Bliss value and increases cell death on LNCaP with calculated positive Bliss values. DCA or doxorubicin in combination with FX-9 do not show synergistic or additive effects on the cell viability. Based on these results, azacitidine or carboplatin in combination with FX-9 offers synergistic/additive efficacy against prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines in vitro.

Methods:   An international database of patients with OMD treated with SBRT was assembled with rigorous quality assurance. Early versus late metastases were defined as those diagnosed ≤24 versus >24 months from the primary tumor. Overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and incidences of wide-spread progression (WSP) were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models stratified by primary tumor types.  Results:   The database consists of 1033 patients with median follow-up of 24.1 months (0.3-104.7). Late metastatic presentation (N = 427) was associated with improved OS compared to early metastasis (median survival 53.6 vs. 33.0 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47-0.72, p < 0.0001).

Objective:   To examine the perioperative and postoperative surgical complications among patients with PC who underwent ORP, LRP, or RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included patients who received a diagnosis of resectable PC and underwent RP between January 1 and December 31, 2015. Participants were enrolled in the Taiwan Cancer Registry. The index date was the date of surgery, and the follow-up duration was the period from the index date to December 31, 2018. Data analysis was performed in September 2020.  Exposures:   ORP, LRP, or RARP.  Main outcomes and measures:   Two multivariate mixed models accounting for hospital clusters were fitted to ascertain the association of RARP with treatment outcomes (ie, hospital stay, blood transfusion, postoperative pain, erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and hernia); general linear regression models were used for continuous outcomes, the amount of blood transfused, and hospital stay, and logistic regression models were used for analyzing postoperative outcomes and surgical complications.  Results:   Of the 1407 patients included in this study, 315 (22.4%) received ORP (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [6.8] years), 276 (19.6%) received LRP (mean [SD] age, 66.8 [6.4] years), and 816 (58.0%) received RARP (mean [SD] age, 66.1 [6.7] years). Mean (SD) follow-up in the full cohort was 36.7 (4.6) months. No statistically significant differences were observed in age, clinical tumor stage, pathological tumor stage, Gleason score, Gleason grade group, preoperative prostate-specific antigen concentration, D'Amico risk classification, and hospital level. A shorter hospital stay was observed for patients undergoing RARP vs those undergoing ORP (mean [SE] difference, -1.64 [0.22] days; P < .001) and LRP (mean [SE] difference, -0.57 [0.23] days; P = .01). Patients undergoing RARP had lower odds of receiving a blood transfusion (RARP vs ORP: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.25; 95% CI, 0.17-0.36; RARP vs LRP: aOR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.91). For postoperative pain, RARP was associated with a decrease in the odds of moderate to severe postoperative pain for as long as 12 weeks compared with both ORP and LRP (eg, RARP vs LRP at week 12: aOR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.19-0.85; P = .02). The aORs for RARP vs those for ORP and LRP in the third year after RP were, for erectile dysfunction, 0.74 (95% CI, 0.45-0.92) and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.36-0.98), respectively; for urinary incontinence, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.65-0.99) and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.42-0.86), respectively; and for hernia, 0.51 (95% CI, 0.31-0.84) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.46-0.92), respectively.

Compared with the control group and NC inhibitor group, the viability, cell migration and invasion ability of PC-3 and LNCap cells were decreased and apoptosis was significantly increased after interference with miR-92a expression. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of PTEN in PC-3 and LNCap cells in the miR-92a inhibitor group were significantly increased, while the phosphorylation levels of PI3K and AKT were significantly decreased. MiR-92a might play a key role in regulating the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells through the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.

Hybrid NEPC-adenocarcinoma (AdCa) tumors are common, often eluding accurate pathologic diagnosis and requiring ancillary markers for classification. We recently performed an outlier-based meta-analysis across a number of independent gene expression microarray datasets to identify novel markers that differentiate NEPC from AdCa, including up-regulation of insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) and loss of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1). Here, using diverse cancer gene expression datasets, we show that Hippo pathway-related genes, including YAP1, are among the top down-regulated gene sets with expression of the neuroendocrine transcription factors, including INSM1. In prostate cancer cell lines, transgenic mouse models, and human prostate tumor cohorts, we confirm that YAP1 RNA and YAP1 protein expression are silenced in NEPC and demonstrate that the inverse correlation of INSM1 and YAP1 expression helps to distinguish AdCa from NEPC. Mechanistically, we find that YAP1 loss in NEPC may help to maintain INSM1 expression in prostate cancer cell lines and we further demonstrate that YAP1 silencing likely occurs epigenetically, via CpG hypermethylation near its transcriptional start site. Taken together, these data nominate two additional markers to distinguish NEPC from AdCa and add to data from other tumor types suggesting that Hippo signaling is tightly reciprocally regulated with neuroendocrine transcription factor expression. © 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

These symptoms are hypothesized to share a common systemic proinflammatory etiology. Thus, an investigation of systemic immune biomarkers is an important approach to test this hypothesis. Here, we investigated the associations between extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated and soluble cytokines with immune markers and symptom clusters in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer. This observational study included 40 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer at the start (T1) of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and 3 months post treatment (T2), as well as 20 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer on active surveillance (AS) seen at one time point. Collected questionnaires assessed patient-reported fatigue, sleep disturbances, depressive symptoms, and cognitive fatigue. In total, 45 soluble and EV-associated biomarkers in plasma were determined by multiplex assays. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify psychoneurological symptom clusters for each study group and their time points. Bivariate correlation analysis was run for each identified PCA cluster with the concentrations of EV-associated and soluble cytokines and immune markers. Both EV-associated and soluble forms of RANTES significantly correlated with the symptom cluster for EBRT at T1, whereas, at T2, soluble IFNα2, IL-9, and IL-17 correlated with the corresponding symptom cluster. For the AS group, soluble survivin correlated with psychoneurological symptoms.

Methods:   The Center for Prostate Disease Research Multicenter National Database was used to identify patients receiving RP from 2007-2017. The Expanded PCa Index Composite and 36 Item Short-Form Health Survey were completed at baseline and regular intervals. Groups were stratified based on age: <60, 60-70, >70. Longitudinal patterns in HRQoL were assessed using linear regression models, adjusting for baseline HRQoL, demographics, and clinical characteristics.  Results:   In 626 patients undergoing RP, 278 (44.4%) were <60, 291 (46.5%) were 60-70, 57 (9.1%) were >70. Older men had worse baseline urinary bother (P<.01) and sexual HRQoL (P<.01). Baseline urinary function was similar for older and younger men. Post-RP urinary and sexual HRQoL was significantly lower in men >70. However, when adjusting for baseline HRQoL, race, NCCN risk, and comorbidities, no difference was found between age groups in urinary function or bother, or sexual function. Sexual bother was worse in older men until 48 months post-operatively but subsequently improved to levels similar to younger patients. Race independently affected HRQoL outcomes with older African American men reporting worse urinary function and sexual bother.

The present study demonstrated that cotreatment of DDP and RSL3, a type of small molecular compound which can inactivate glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and induce ferroptosis, synergistically inhibited the viability and proliferation of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo at low dose. In vitro studies revealed that RSL3 improved that sensitivity of PCa cells to DDP by producing ROS and aggravating the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis caused by DDP. Mechanistically, RSL3 could decrease the ATP and pyruvate content as well as the protein levels of HKII, PFKP, PKM2, which indicated that RSL3 induced glycolysis dysfunction in prostate cancer cells. Rescuing RSL3-induced glycolysis dysfunction by supplement of exterior sodium pyruvate not only inhibited RSL3/DDP-induced changes of apoptosis-related proteins levels, but also mitigated the cell death caused by RSL3/DDP. In vivo studies further confirmed that cotreatment of RSL3 and DDP at low dose significantly inhibited the growth of PCa with no obvious side effects. Taken together, we demonstrated that RSL3 improved the sensitivity of PCa to DDP via causing glycolysis dysfunction. Our findings indicated that DDP-based chemotherapy combined with RSL3 might provide a promising therapy for PCa.""","""['Mengxin Li', 'Xuyang Chen', 'Xuanzhong Wang', 'Xiaodong Wei', 'Ding Wang', 'Xiaorui Liu', 'Libo Xu', 'Wuren Batu', 'Yang Li', 'Baofeng Guo', 'Ling Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['RSL3 induced autophagic death in glioma cells via causing glycolysis dysfunction.', 'Knockdown of HIF-1α by siRNA-expressing plasmid delivered by attenuated Salmonella enhances the antitumor effects of cisplatin on prostate cancer.', 'Nrf2 inhibition reverses resistance to GPX4 inhibitor-induced ferroptosis in head and neck cancer.', 'DHA exhibits synergistic therapeutic efficacy with cisplatin to induce ferroptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma via modulation of iron metabolism.', 'The induction of ferroptosis by impairing STAT3/Nrf2/GPx4 signaling enhances the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin.', 'GPX4 overexpressed non-small cell lung cancer cells are sensitive to RSL3-induced ferroptosis.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'The role of ferroptosis in prostate cancer: a novel therapeutic strategy.', 'NXPH4 Promotes Gemcitabine Resistance in Bladder Cancer by Enhancing Reactive Oxygen Species and Glycolysis Activation through Modulating NDUFA4L2.', 'Post-Translational Modification of GPX4 is a Promising Target for Treating Ferroptosis-Related Diseases.']"""

We compared PCa detection rates on systematic, magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, and combined biopsy with evaluation of important subgroups.  Materials and methods:   Men with clinical suspicion of harboring PCa from 2 institutions with visible Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADSTMv2) lesions receiving mpMRI-US fusion-guided prostate biopsy were included (2015-2020). Detection of PCa was categorized by grade group (GG). Clinically-significant PCa (csPCa) was defined as ≥GG2. Patients were stratified by biopsy setting and PI-RADS.  Results:   Of 1,236 patients (647 biopsy-naïve) included, 626 (50.6%) harbored PCa and 412 (33.3%) had csPCa on combined biopsy. Detection of csPCa was 27.9% vs 23.3% (+4.6%) and GG1 PCa was 11.3% vs 17.8% (-6.5%) for targeted vs systematic cores. Benefit in csPCa detection was higher in the prior negative than biopsy-naïve setting (+7.8% [p <0.0001] vs +1.7% [p=0.3]) while reduction in GG1 PCa detection remained similar (-5.6% [p=0.0002] vs -7.3% [p=0.0001]). Targeted biopsy showed increased csPCa detection for PI-RADS 5, decrease in GG1 for PI-RADS 3, and both for PI-RADS 4 relative to systematic biopsy. Combined biopsy detected more csPCa (+10.0%) and slightly fewer GG1 PCa (-0.5%) compared to systematic alone. Upgrading to ≥GG2 by targeted biopsy occurred in 9.8% with no cancer and 23.6% with GG1 on systematic biopsy.  Conclusions:   Combined biopsy doubled the benefit of targeted biopsy alone in detection of csPCa without increasing GG1 PCa diagnoses relative to systematic biopsy. Utility of targeted biopsy was higher in the prior negative biopsy cohort, but advantages of combined biopsy were maintained regardless of biopsy history.""","""['Hiten D Patel', 'Elizabeth L Koehne', 'Steven M Shea', 'Andrew M Fang', 'Alex Gorbonos', 'Marcus L Quek', 'Robert C Flanigan', 'Ari Goldberg', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami', 'Gopal N Gupta']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-naïve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009≤\u20093?', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Methods:   Patients with clinical T2-4aN0/XM0 muscle-invasive bladder cancer eligible for RC were enrolled. The initial six patients received lead-in pembrolizumab 200 mg once 2 weeks prior to pembrolizumab 200 mg once on day 1, cisplatin 70 mg/m2 once on day 1, and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2 once on days 1 and 8 every 21 days for four cycles. This schedule was discontinued for toxicity and subsequent patients received cisplatin 35 mg/m2 once on days 1 and 8 without lead-in pembrolizumab. The primary end point was pathologic downstaging (< pT2N0) with null and alternative hypothesis rates of 35% and 55%, respectively. Secondary end points were toxicity including patient-reported outcomes, complete pathologic response (pT0N0), event-free survival, and overall survival.

Anatomical landmarks on sagittal images were related to a coordinate system based on reference lines between fixed bony structures and absolute displacements were calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. Rotation of landmarks was measured relative to a pubic-S5 reference line.  Results:   There were 248 patients included of which 171 were men and 77 women. The median displacement of the internal urethral orifice was 25 mm in men (maximum 65), and 17 mm in women (maximum 50).

Displacements of the posterior bladder wall, distal end of prostatic urethra and cervix were significantly correlated with the internal urethral orifice. In linear regression analysis, biological mesh reconstruction of the pelvic floor and visceral interposition were significantly associated with increased displacement of the internal urethral orifice, and female gender and any filling of the presacral space with decreased displacement.

However, the relative clinical utility of identified lesions on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is uncertain between the 2 settings.  Methods:   Patients from the Prospective Loyola University mpMRI (PLUM) Prostate Biopsy Cohort (January 2015 to June 2020) were examined. The detection of any prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) was stratified by Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores in the prior negative and biopsy-naive settings. Multivariable logistic regression models (PLUM models) assessed predictors, and decision curve analyses were used to estimate the clinical utility of PI-RADS cutoffs relative to the models.  Results:   Nine hundred men (420 prior negative patients and 480 biopsy-naive patients) were included. Prior negative patients had lower risks of any prostate cancer (27.9% vs 54.4%) and clinically significant prostate cancer (20.0% vs 38.3%) in comparison with biopsy-naive patients, and this persisted when they were stratified by PI-RADS (eg, PI-RADS 3: 13.6% vs 27.4% [any prostate cancer] and 5.2% vs 15.4% [clinically significant prostate cancer]). The rate of detection of clinically significant prostate cancer was 5.3% among men with prior negative biopsy and PI-RADS ≤ 3. Family history and Asian ancestry were significant predictors among biopsy-naive patients. PLUM models demonstrated a greater net benefit and reduction in biopsies (45.8%) without missing clinically significant cancer in comparison with PI-RADS cutoffs (PI-RADS 4: 34.0%).  Conclusions:   Patients with prior negative biopsies had lower prostate cancer detection by PI-RADS score category in comparison with biopsy-naive men. Decision curve analyses suggested that many biopsies could be avoided by the use of the PLUM models or a PI-RADS 4 cutoff without any clinically significant cancer being missed.  Lay summary:   Men with a prior negative prostate biopsy had a lower risk of harboring prostate cancer in comparison with those who never had a biopsy. This was true even when patients in each group had similar multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) findings in terms of Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS)-graded lesions.

Modern procedures in radiation therapy with respect to indication, therapy planning and implementation of shorter treatment regimens result in high local tumor control and excellent quality of life in frequent and clinically relevant disease entities including breast and prostate cancer as well as bone metastases. In the adjuvant therapy for early breast cancer, a careful comparative analysis of the use of endocrine adjuvant treatment over five years versus postoperative radiation therapy over less than four weeks may result in omission of radiation treatment in a selected patient population. Partial breast irradiation, while treating the tumor bed only in low risk situations, and hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy for patients with a higher risk profile for local recurrence, halved treatment time compared to 10 years ago, making adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with breast cancer more convenient. In patients with localized prostate cancer, the introduction of hypofractionated treatment regimens halved the number of daily fractions and current developments point towards a one-week outpatient therapy for locally limited disease using high precision stereotactic techniques and accurate therapy planning based on multifunctional imaging. Patients with bone metastases are more and more treated with a single fraction, high precision stereotactic radiotherapy (radiosurgery) with high analgesic potential and achieving long lasting local tumor control. These modern, often significantly shorter, radiotherapy treatment regimens not only result in an excellent treatment response and better quality of life for patients, but also include a better utilization of radiotherapy resources needing less treatment machines and thus helping to reduce costs in the Swiss healthcare system.""","""['Frank Zimmermann', 'Anna-Lena Eberhardt', 'Robert Förster', 'Daniel R Zwahlen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Ther Umsch""","""['Modern Treatment Concepts in Radiation Oncology.', 'Accelerated hypofractionated adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy with concomitant photon boost after conserving surgery for early stage breast cancer: a prospective evaluation on 463 patients.', 'Are We Choosing Wisely in Radiation Oncology Practice-Findings From an Australian Population-Based Study.', 'Analysis of Outcomes Using Hypofractionated Tumor Bed Boost Combined With Hypofractionated Whole Breast Irradiation for Early-stage Breast Cancer.', 'Palliative Treatment of Cancer-Related Pain Internet.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 15882 subjects were followed up for cancer development and cancer-related death. During the follow-up period, 1619 cancer diagnoses and 617 cancer-related deaths were recorded. Cox proportional regression was performed to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) per standard deviation (SD) increment and 95% confidence interval (CI). The model was adjusted for covariates such as the age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, education level, body mass index, and family history. Sensitivity analyses using the study subjects with physiological serum levels of each indicator were also performed.  Results:   UA levels were positively correlated with cancer risk (HR per SD increment 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.09), and albumin levels were inversely associated with the overall cancer risk (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) and cancer-related death (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93). Total bilirubin levels were negatively correlated with the risk of cancer-related death (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-0.99). By cancer type, UA was positively associated with prostate cancer, total bilirubin was positively associated with liver cancer, and albumin was inversely associated with lung cancer.

The study was carried out in an open-label two-cohort design. Patients who had developed disease progression on or were eligible for enzalutamide were enrolled in the study. The safety profile of the combination therapy, Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, the pharmacokinetics of enzalutamide after entinostat administration, peripheral T-cell subtype (including Treg quantitation), and mononuclear cell (PBMC) histone H3 acetylation were analyzed.  Results:   Six patients with metastatic CRPC were enrolled. There was no noticeable increment of fatigue related to entinostat. Toxicities possibly or probably related to entinostat or the combination therapy included grade 3 anemia 1/6 (17%), grade 2 white blood cell (WBC) decrease 1/6 (17%), and other self-limiting grade 1 adverse events (AEs). Median duration of treatment with entinostat was 18 weeks. Entinostat did not affect the steady plasma concentration of enzalutamide. Increased PBMC histone H3 acetylation was observed in blood samples. No evident T-cell subtype changes were detected, including in Treg quantitation.  Conclusion:   Entinostat 5 mg weekly in combination with enzalutamide showed an acceptable safety profile in this small phase I study.

Artificial Intelligence algorithms have had a huge impact on medical image analysis, including digital histopathology, where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to provide a fast and accurate diagnosis, supporting experts in this task. To perform an automatic diagnosis, prostate tissue samples are first digitized into gigapixel-resolution whole-slide images. Due to the size of these images, neural networks cannot use them as input and, therefore, small subimages called patches are extracted and predicted, obtaining a patch-level classification. In this work, a novel patch aggregation method based on a custom Wide & Deep neural network model is presented, which performs a slide-level classification using the patch-level classes obtained from a CNN. The malignant tissue ratio, a 10-bin malignant probability histogram, the least squares regression line of the histogram, and the number of malignant connected components are used by the proposed model to perform the classification. An accuracy of 94.24% and a sensitivity of 98.87% were achieved, proving that the proposed system could aid pathologists by speeding up the screening process and, thus, contribute to the fight against PCa.""","""['L Duran-Lopez', 'Juan P Dominguez-Morales', 'D Gutierrez-Galan', 'A Rios-Navarro', 'A Jimenez-Fernandez', 'S Vicente-Diaz', 'A Linares-Barranco']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['Comparison of Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Evaluate Performance of a Classifier for Automatic Grading of Prostate Cancer From Digitized Histopathologic Images.', 'Semi-supervised training of deep convolutional neural networks with heterogeneous data and few local annotations: An experiment on prostate histopathology image classification.', 'Bone metastasis classification using whole body images from prostate cancer patients based on convolutional neural networks application.', 'Convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection or diagnosis in medical image analysis: An overview.', 'Deep learning for colon cancer histopathological images analysis.', 'MixPatch: A New Method for Training Histopathology Image Classifiers.']"""

This study assesses if geographic factors in Saskatchewan, including location of where patients live and physician density are affecting the PCa incidence. First, the objective of this study is to estimate the PCa standardized incidence ratio (SIRs) in Saskatchewan stratified by PCa risk-level. Second, this study identifies clusters of higher than and lower than expected PCa SIRs in Saskatchewan. Lastly, this study identifies the association (if any) between family physician density and estimated PCa SIRs in Saskatchewan.  Methods:   First, using Global Moran's I, Local Moran's I, and the Kuldorff's Spatial Scan Statistic, the study identifies clusters of PCa stratified by risk-levels. Then this study estimates the SIRs of PCa and its association with family physician density in Saskatchewan using the Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM) Bayesian method.  Results:   Higher than expected clusters of crude estimated SIR for metastatic PCa were identified in north-east Saskatchewan and lower than expected clusters were identified in south-east Saskatchewan. Areas in north-west Saskatchewan have lower than expected crude estimated SIRs for both intermediate-risk and low-risk PCa. Family physician density was negatively associated with SIRs of metastatic PCa (IRR: 0.935 [CrI: 0.880 to 0.998]) and SIRs of high-risk PCa (IRR: 0.927 [CrI: 0.880 to 0.975]).  Conclusions:   This study identifies the geographical disparities in risk-stratified PCa incidence in Saskatchewan. The study identifies areas with a lower family physician density have a higher-than-expected incidences of metastatic and high-risk PCa.

The aim of this study was to identify the clinical characteristics and outcomes of polypharmacy, investigate the relationship of polypharmacy with health status and exacerbations and assess the prevalence of inappropriate medication (PIM), risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug-to-drug interactions in COPD patients.  Methods:   A total of 245 COPD patients were enrolled from primary care in Crete, Greece. Patients completed a questionnaire and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Multimorbidity was defined as having two or more comorbidities and polypharmacy was defined as taking five or more drugs per day.  Results:   Most of COPD patients (77.0%) and the majority (83.6%) of elderly (≥65 years) had multimorbidity, while polypharmacy was evident in 55.2% of all patients and 62.4% in elderly. After adjustments for age, gender and pack-years, polypharmacy was associated with CAT ≥ 10, multimorbidity, several cardiometabolic diseases, cancer and depression-anxiety and prostate disorders (all p values > 0.05).

A human non-tumour cell line, CCD841 CoN (normal colon cell line) was also used. MTT assay, flow cytometry, fluorescence and hemocompatibility techniques were performed to further analyse the cytotoxicity of the compounds. 3,4 - OLOX was the most effective compound in decreasing tumour cell proliferation in all cell lines, especially in WiDr (IC50 = 9.1 μM) and PC3 (IC50 = 13.8 μM). 4,5 - OLOX also showed promising results in the same cell lines (IC50 = 16.1 μM in WiDr and IC50 = 14.5 μM in PC3). Further studies also revealed that 3,4 - OLOX and 4,5 - OLOX induced a decrease in cell viability accompanied by an increase in cell death, mainly by apoptosis/necroptosis for 3,4 - OLOX in both cell lines and for 4,5 - OLOX in WiDr cells, and by necrosis for 4,5 - OLOX in PC3 cells. These compounds might also exert their cytotoxicity by ROS production and are not toxic for non-tumour CCD841 CoN cells.

A purinergic G-protein coupled receptor, P2Y1R, is targeted for its therapeutic value since it plays a crucial role in many key molecular events of cancer progression and invasion. Our previous study demonstrated that indoline derivative, 1 ((1-(2-Hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl) (4-hydroxyphenyl) methyl)indoline-4‑carbonitrile; HIC), stimulates prostate cancer cell (PCa) growth inhibition via P2Y1R. However, the mode of interaction of P2Y1R with HIC involved in this process remains unclear. Here, we have reported the molecular interactions of HIC with P2Y1R. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed that revealed the stable specific binding of the protein-ligand complex. In vitro analysis has shown increased apoptosis of PCa-cells, PC3, and DU145, upon specific interaction of P2Y1R-HIC. This was further validated using siRNA analysis that showed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in PCa-cells transfected with P2Y-siRNA-MRS2365 than P2Y-siRNA-HIC treatment. Decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) level show their role in P2Y1R-HIC mediated apoptosis. These in silico and in vitro results confirmed that HIC could induce mitochondrial apoptotic signaling through the P2Y1R activation. Thus, HIC being a potential ligand upon interaction with P2Y1R might have therapeutic value for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Hien Thi Thu Le', 'Akshaya Murugesan', 'Thiyagarajan Ramesh', 'Olli Yli-Harja', 'Saravanan Konda Mani', 'Meenakshisundaram Kandhavelu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Biol Macromol""","""['P2Y1 agonist HIC in combination with androgen receptor inhibitor abiraterone acetate impairs cell growth of prostate cancer.', 'Functional characterization of HIC, a P2Y1 agonist, as a p53 stabilizer for prostate cancer cell death induction.', 'Synthesis and preclinical validation of novel P2Y1 receptor ligands as a potent anti-prostate cancer agent.', 'Hetero-oligomerization and Functional Interaction between Purinergic Receptors Expressed in Platelets to Regulate Platelet Shape Change.', 'Functions of heteromeric association between adenosine and P2Y receptors.', 'Application of molecular dynamics simulation in self-assembled cancer nanomedicine.', 'Purinergic signaling: Diverse effects and therapeutic potential in cancer.', 'GPCR genes as a predictor of glioma severity and clinical outcome.', 'The P2 purinoceptors in prostate cancer.', 'Programmed cell death detection methods: a systematic review and a categorical comparison.']"""

Methods:   All consecutive ≥ 70-year-old patients with localized prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent SBRT between 2014 and 2018 at the National Radiotherapy Center in Luxembourg were included. Patients with low Cancer of Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) scores (0-2) and intermediate scores (3-5) received 36.25 Gy. High-risk (6-10) patients received 37.5 Gy.

There is further evidence that CSCs may act as metastatic precursors of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In the present study, we investigated the key molecules involved in maintaining the stability of CSCs by inducing ectopic overexpression of CD133 to characterize EMT in human prostate cancer cell lines, including PC-3, DU145, and LnCaP cells. Additionally, we investigated whether a specific inhibitor of concomitantly expressed metastasis-related genes could alleviate EMT properties in CD133-overexpressing prostate cancer cells. Ectopic overexpression of CD133 in PC-3, DU145, and LnCaP cells led to an increase in the expression of HDAC9. Moreover, HDAC9 inhibition led to a decrease in EMT properties along with increased E-cadherin expression, a narrower wound gap distance, and enhanced cell invasiveness through the suppression of β-catenin activation and its translocation to the nucleus.

Methods and Results A study was conducted in US male veterans, aged ≥40 years, with low serum testosterone and multiple medical comorbidities and without history of myocardial infarction, stroke, venous thromboembolism, prostate cancer, or testosterone treatment in the prior year. For the primary outcome, we examined if testosterone treatment was associated with a composite cardiovascular outcome (incident myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or venous thromboembolism). Testosterone use was modeled as intramuscular or transdermal and as current use, former use, and no use. Current testosterone users were compared with former users to reduce confounding by indication. The cohort consisted of 204 857 men with a mean (SD) age of 60.9 (9.9) years and 4.7 (3.5) chronic medical conditions.

It has previously been shown that the cell cycle progression (CCP) test provides significant, independent prognostic information for men who were incidentally diagnosed with PrCa after transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and were conservatively managed.  Aim:   The results have been extended in a newly analyzed retrospective cohort of UK men diagnosed through TURP biopsy (TURP1B; N = 305).  Methods and results:   The CCP score was derived from TURP biopsy tissue and combined with a modified UCSF Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score (CAPRA) to generate the clinical cell-cycle risk score (CCR). The primary endpoint was PrCa-specific mortality (PSM). Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for a one-unit change in score. Median follow-up was 9.6 (IQR: 5.4, 14.1) years, and 67 (22%) men died from PrCa within 10 years of diagnosis. The median CCP score was 1.1 (IQR: 0.6, 1.7).

Methods:   Secondary endpoints were not included in our initial report, and we include them herein, after a median follow-up of 22 months. These objectives included long-term safety, prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS), and radiographic progression-free survival; PSA-PFS2 (time from start of protocol therapy to PSA progression on subsequent therapy); time to next therapy (TTNT); and overall survival (OS).

However, alterations in other homologous recombination repair (HRR)-related genes and their clinical significance in other cancer types have not been adequately and systematically investigated.  Methods:   We obtained data sets of all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, and comprehensively analyzed HRR pathway gene alterations, their loss-of-heterozygosity status, and per-sample genomic scar scores, that is, the HRD score and mutational signature 3 ratio, DNA methylation profiles, gene expression profiles, somatic TP53 mutations, sex, and clinical or in vitro response to chemical exposure.  Results:   Biallelic alterations in HRR genes other than BRCA1/2 were also associated with elevated genomic scar scores. The association between HRR-related gene alterations and genomic scar scores differed significantly by sex and the presence of somatic TP53 mutations.

Methods:   Data was retrospectively analyzed from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for patients with localized prostate cancer treated between 2010 and 2015. Patients were included if they had biopsy confirmed localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate, were treated with radiation as definitive local therapy, and were at least 18 years old. Utilization rates of external beam radiation (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT) and combination (EBRT + BT) were evaluated over time. Univariable (UVA) and backwards elimination multivariable (MVA) analysis were performed to determine characteristics predictive for brachytherapy use.  Results:   We analyzed 178,837 patients with localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated between 2010 and 2015 with radiation therapy. During this period, the use of EBRT increased from 67% to 78%, BT (both monotherapy and combination with EBRT) decreased from 33% to 22%, BT monotherapy decreased from 25% to 16% and EBRT + BT decreased from 8% to 6%. Age >70, government funded insurance or lack of insurance, intermediate or high-risk disease and treatment at an academic center were associated with significantly lower utilization of brachytherapy (all p <0.001), while higher median zip code income was associated with increased use (p = 0.02).

Three materials were used: gelatin powder, graphite powder, and water. The prostate was developed using 9% gelatin and 0.3% graphite per 100 ml water. Five radiation oncologists were asked to qualitatively score the phantom according to image quality, haptic feedback, needle insertion quality, and its compatibility with operative tools. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was estimated using different concentrations of graphite. The elasticity of the phantom was evaluated based on ultrasound elastography measurements RESULTS: The prostate phantom had an average CNR of 3.94 ± 1.09 compared to real prostate images with a CNR of 2 ± 1.8. The average Young's modulus was computed to be 58.03 ± 6.24 kPa compared to real prostate tissue (58.8 ± 8.2 kPa). Oncologists ranked the phantom as ""very good"" for overall quality of the phantom. They reported that needle insertion quality was ""very good"" during a simulated brachytherapy procedure.

For cabazitaxel, there was no OS difference between patients with high versus low NLR (15.3 versus 12.9 months, respectively; P = 0.7465). Patients receiving an ARTA with high NLR, however, had a worse OS versus those with low NLR (9.5 versus 13.3 months, respectively; P = 0.0608).  Conclusions:   High baseline NLR predicts poor outcomes with an ARTA in patients with mCRPC previously treated with docetaxel and the alternative ARTA. Conversely, the activity of cabazitaxel is retained irrespective of NLR.""","""['R de Wit', 'C Wülfing', 'D Castellano', 'G Kramer', 'J-C Eymard', 'C N Sternberg', 'K Fizazi', 'B Tombal', 'A Bamias', 'J Carles', 'R Iacovelli', 'B Melichar', 'Á Sverrisdóttir', 'C Theodore', 'S Feyerabend', 'C Helissey', 'M C Foster', 'A Ozatilgan', 'C Geffriaud-Ricouard', 'J de Bono']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""ESMO Open""","""['Efficacy and Safety of Cabazitaxel Versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Older Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the CARD Study.', 'Cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: post hoc analysis of the CARD study excluding chemohormonal therapy for castrate-naive disease.', 'Quality of life in patients with metastatic prostate cancer following treatment with cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide (CARD): an analysis of a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 4 study.', 'Revealing the prognostic landscape of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide: a meta-analysis.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

STK3 and its paralog STK4 initiate a phosphorylation cascade that regulates YAP1/TAZ inhibition and degradation, which is important for regulated cell growth and organ size. Deregulation of this pathway leads to hyperactivation of YAP1 in various cancers. Counter to the canonical tumor suppression role of STK3, we report that in the context of prostate cancer (PC), STK3 has a pro-tumorigenic role. Our investigation started with the observation that STK3, but not STK4, is frequently amplified in PC. Additionally, high STK3 expression is associated with decreased overall survival and positively correlates with androgen receptor (AR) activity in metastatic castrate-resistant PC. XMU-MP-1, an STK3/4 inhibitor, slowed cell proliferation, spheroid growth, and Matrigel invasion in multiple models. Genetic depletion of STK3 decreased proliferation in several PC cell lines. In a syngeneic allograft model, STK3 loss slowed tumor growth kinetics in vivo, and biochemical analysis suggests a mitotic growth arrest phenotype. To further probe the role of STK3 in PC, we identified and validated a new set of selective STK3 inhibitors, with enhanced kinase selectivity relative to XMU-MP-1, that inhibited tumor spheroid growth and invasion. Consistent with the canonical role, inhibition of STK3 induced cardiomyocyte growth and had chemoprotective effects. Our results indicate that STK3 has a non-canonical role in PC progression and that inhibition of STK3 may have a therapeutic potential for PC that merits further investigation.""","""['Amelia U Schirmer', 'Lucy M Driver', 'Megan T Zhao', 'Carrow I Wells', 'Julie E Pickett', ""Sean N O'Bryne"", 'Benjamin J Eduful', 'Xuan Yang', 'Lauren Howard', 'Sungyong You', 'Gayathri R Devi', 'John DiGiovanni', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Jen-Tsan Chi', 'David H Drewry', 'Everardo Macias']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""['Inhibitors of the Hippo Pathway Kinases STK3/MST2 and STK4/MST1 Have Utility for the Treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'STK3/STK4 signalling in adipocytes regulates mitophagy and energy expenditure.', 'PIN1 facilitates ubiquitin-mediated degradation of serine/threonine kinase 3 and promotes melanoma development via TAZ activation.', 'Hippo Signaling in the Liver Regulates Organ Size, Cell Fate, and\xa0Carcinogenesis.', 'The Hippo Pathway in Prostate Cancer.', 'Developing a Kinase Chemogenomic Set: Facilitating Investigation into Kinase Biology by Linking Phenotypes to Targets.', 'The hippo kinases MST1/2 in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases: A promising therapeutic target option for pharmacotherapy.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'The Hippo signalling pathway and its implications in human health and diseases.', 'DNA Topoisomerase II-α Regulated by miR-22-5p Promotes Hepatocellular Carcinoma Invasion and Migration through the Hippo Pathway.']"""

We aimed to study the relationship between initial adherence to medication use and mortality in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). The PCPT randomized men age 55 and over to a finasteride or placebo arm. Duration of treatment was seven years, followed by end-of-study prostate biopsy. Extended follow-up for mortality was performed by linkage to the National Death Index. Non-adherence was defined as taking under 80% of required pills during the first or second 6-month trial period. Proportional hazards models were used to assess the relationship between adherence and all-cause mortality (excluding prostate cancer deaths). Three models were developed as follows: Model I (controlling for demographics and trial arm), Model II (Model I factors plus specific medical conditions), Model III (Model II factors plus lifestyle factors). Of 18,667 men included in the analysis, 3082 (16.5%) were non-adherent. The most common reasons for non-adherence were side effects (33.9%) and forgetting to take pills (22%). Through 5 and 10 years of follow-up, 178 (5.9%) and 483 (15.7%) non-adherent men died versus 581 (3.7%) and 1887 (12.1%) adherent men.

While prostate volume predicts biopsy outcome, it requires an imaging procedure for measurement. The four kallikrein panel - commercially available as the 4Kscore - predicts risk of GG2+ disease and requires only a blood draw.  Materials and methods:   A total of 9131 patients with available prostate volume and total PSA ≤25 ng/ml from 5 historical (sextant biopsy, pre-ISUP 2005 grading) and 4 contemporary cohorts (10+ cores, ISUP 2005 grading). Previously published kallikrein panel models were used to predict risk of GG2+. Volume was added to the model in each cohort and change in discrimination was meta-analyzed.  Results:   Increased prostate volume was associated with decreased risk of GG2+ disease after controlling for the kallikrein panel in 7/9 cohorts. However, kallikrein panel discrimination (0.817, 95% CI 0.802, 0.831) was not improved after including volume (AUC difference 0.002, 95% CI -0.003, 0.006).

Conclusion:   The kallikrein panel provides a non-invasive approach to assess the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.

Abiraterone acetate is known to be hydrolyzed by pancreatic cholesterol esterase secreted into the intestinal lumen. This study aimed to investigate the possibility that arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) expressed in enterocytes contributes to the hydrolysis of abiraterone acetate based on its substrate preference.  Materials and methods:   Abiraterone acetate hydrolase activity was measured using human intestinal (HIM) and liver microsomes (HLM) as well as recombinant AADAC. Correlation analysis between activity and AADAC expression was performed in 14 individual HIMs. The in vivo pharmacokinetics of abiraterone acetate was examined using wild-type and Aadac knockout mice administered abiraterone acetate with or without orlistat, a pancreatic cholesterol esterase inhibitor.  Key findings:   Recombinant AADAC showed abiraterone acetate hydrolase activity with similar Km value to HIM and HLM. The positive correlation between activity and AADAC levels in individual HIMs supported the responsibility of AADAC for abiraterone acetate hydrolysis. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of abiraterone after oral administration of abiraterone acetate in Aadac knockout mice was 38% lower than that in wild-type mice. The involvement of pancreatic cholesterol esterase in abiraterone formation was revealed by the decreased AUC of abiraterone by coadministration of orlistat. Orlistat potently inhibited AADAC, implying its potential as a perpetrator of drug-drug interactions.  Significance:   AADAC is responsible for the hydrolysis of abiraterone acetate in the intestine and liver, suggesting that concomitant use of abiraterone acetate and drugs potently inhibiting AADAC should be avoided.""","""['Yoshiyuki Sakai', 'Tatsuki Fukami', 'Mai Nagaoka', 'Keiya Hirosawa', 'Hiroyuki Ichida', 'Rei Sato', 'Kohei Suzuki', 'Masataka Nakano', 'Miki Nakajima']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Role of Human Arylacetamide Deacetylase (AADAC) on Hydrolysis of Eslicarbazepine Acetate and Effects of AADAC Genetic Polymorphisms on Hydrolase Activity.', 'Arylacetamide Deacetylase is Responsible for Activation of Prasugrel in Human and Dog.', 'Indiplon is hydrolyzed by arylacetamide deacetylase in human liver.', 'Role of Human Orphan Esterases in Drug-induced Toxicity.', 'Pharmacokinetic Aspects of the Two Novel Oral Drugs Used for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Abiraterone Acetate and Enzalutamide.', 'Characterization, comparative, and functional analysis of arylacetamide deacetylase from Gnathostomata organisms.']"""

AsA-impelled loss of cellular viability was also evident from the acridine orange-stained photomicrographs, which was also used to quantify the viable and apoptotic cells using Image J software. Additionally, quantification of ROS within PC-3 cells also exhibited an increase in DCF-DA-mediated fluorescence intensity post-exposure to AsA in a dose-dependent manner. AsA-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells was shown to be associated with augmented activity of caspase-3 proportionally to the AsA concentrations.

Compared to social media nonusers, users were more likely to have heard of HCV (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=2.27, 95% CI, 1.29-3.98 and aOR=2.86, 95% CI, 1.51-5.40, for male and female users, respectively) and HPV (aOR=1.82, 95% CI, 1.29-2.58 and aOR=2.35, 95% CI, 1.65-3.33, for male and female users, respectively). In addition, female users were more likely to have heard of the HPV vaccine (aOR=2.06, 95% CI, 1.41-3.00). No significant associations were found between social media use and prostate-specific antigen tests in males, Papanicolaou tests and breast cancer tests in females, or colon cancer tests in both male and female users.  Conclusions:   While social media services can potentially promote cancer screening awareness in the general population, but they did not improve screening behavior after adjusting for socioeconomic status. These findings strengthened our understanding of social media use in targeting health communications for different cancers.""","""['Lei Qin#', 'Xiaomei Zhang', 'Anlin Wu', 'James S Miser', 'Yen-Lin Liu', 'Jason C Hsu', 'Ben-Chang Shia#', 'Linglong Ye#']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Med Internet Res""","""['The Relationships Between Social Media and Human Papillomavirus Awareness and Knowledge: Cross-sectional Study.', 'Social media use and human papillomavirus awareness and knowledge among adults with children in the household: examining the role of race, ethnicity, and gender.', 'Social media engagement association with human papillomavirus and vaccine awareness and perceptions: Results from the 2017 US Health Information National Trends Survey.', 'Prophylaxis of cervical cancer and related cervical disease: a review of the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against oncogenic HPV types.', 'Knowledge of human papillomavirus and the human papillomavirus vaccine in European adolescents: a systematic review.', 'The Role of Social Media in Breast Cancer Care and Survivorship: A Narrative Review.', 'Chronic Diseases and Sociodemographic Characteristics Associated With Online Health Information Seeking and Using Social Networking Sites: Nationally Representative Cross-sectional Survey in Japan.', 'The Relationships Between Social Media and Human Papillomavirus Awareness and Knowledge: Cross-sectional Study.', 'Digital Marketing: A Unique Multidisciplinary Approach towards the Elimination of Viral Hepatitis.']"""

We wanted to evaluate the performance of mpMRI for muscle-invasion detection in BC patients using a subjective MRI visual T-category and the Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) score.  Methods:   This single centre clinical trial included 45 patients with suspected BC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02662166). All patients had mpMRI prior to transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TUR-BT). The imaging was correlated to histopathological findings. Two individual radiologists evaluated all the mpMRI images. A binary cut-off point for the detection of muscle-invasion in the MRI visual T-category was defined between T1 and T2 and the VI-RADS cut-off score was 3. Cohen's Kappa values were used to evaluate the agreement between the two radiologists. Sensitivity, Specificity, Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC), Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) were calculated to evaluate the performance of both radiologists separately.  Results:   AUC values for reader A and B using the MRI visual T-category were 0.76 and 0.56, while the corresponding values for VI-RADS were 0.63 and 0.57, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the radiologists nor the reporting systems (p > .05) in the detection of muscle-invasion. The inter-reader agreement was substantial (0.61-0.80).

Proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase Pim1 (PIM1) is involved in cell survival and proliferation, with great relevance for oncogenesis. PIM1 plays a major role in the progression of various common complex human cancers, including prostate cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and other hematopoietic malignancies. The overexpression of PIM1 leads to cancer progression, and thus it is considered as a potential target for drug design and development purposes. Here, we report original in silico findings by employing structure-based virtual screening to discover potential phytoconstituents from the medicinal plants-based compounds, which could inhibit the PIM1 activity, using the IMPPAT (a curated database of Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics) database. The initial hits were selected based on their binding affinity toward PIM1 calculated through the molecular docking approach. Subsequently, interaction analyses and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for 100 ns was carried out to study the conformational dynamics and complex stability of PIM1 with the identified compounds. Importantly, we found that PIM1 forms stable protein-ligand complexes with the phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin in particular. Our findings suggest that identified phytoconstituents Dehydrotectol and Nordracorubin bind to PIM1 in ATP-competitive binding mode. These findings and the compounds reported herein warrant further exploration as promising scaffolds for anticancer drug design, discovery, and development.""","""['Farah Anjum', 'Taj Mohammad', 'Abdulraheem Ali Almalki', 'Omar Akhtar', 'Bekhzod Abdullaev', 'Md Imtaiyaz Hassan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""OMICS""","""['Death-Associated Protein Kinase 3 Inhibitors Identified by Virtual Screening for Drug Discovery in Cancer and Hypertension.', 'Investigating single amino acid substitutions in PIM1 kinase: A structural genomics approach.', 'Using insights into Pim1 structure to design new anticancer drugs.', 'Small molecule inhibitors of PIM1 kinase: July 2009 to February 2013 patent update.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.', 'Enhanced MCM5 Level Predicts Bad Prognosis in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Structure-Guided Approach to Discover Tuberosin as a Potent Activator of Pyruvate Kinase M2, Targeting Cancer Therapy.', 'A Network-Guided Approach to Discover Phytochemical-Based Anticancer Therapy: Targeting MARK4 for Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Discovering Tuberosin and Villosol as Potent and Selective Inhibitors of AKT1 for Therapeutic Targeting of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum Extract and its Bioactive Component Cinnamaldehyde Show Anti-Tumor Effects via Inhibition of Multiple Cellular Pathways.']"""

This phase 1 clinical study was an open-label, parallel-design, single-center, single-dose study in older, healthy male subjects. Following injection, teverelix is released into the systemic circulation in a biphasic manner.

Patients and methods:   Cause-of-death annotation in our prospective database was supplemented with death certificate information obtained via an internal audit of patients treated from 1999 to 2017 with LDR prostate brachytherapy as monotherapy or as combination with androgen deprivation therapy and/or external beam radiotherapy. Overall and disease-specific survival were the primary outcomes, estimated with Kaplan-Meier and competing risks multi-state models. Clinical variables influencing mortality were assessed with Cox proportional hazards regression in a sub-analysis of men to assess the predictive value of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at 48 months post implant.  Results:   The audit process began in October 2017 and culminated in June 2020 with a curated series of 2936 patients. All-cause and prostate cancer-specific death prevalence were 11% and 2.9%, respectively. The median (range) follow-up time was 10 (3-21) years and the median (range) time to death from any cause was 9 (3-21) years. At 15 years post implant the overall and prostate cancer-specific survival probability were 81% and 95%, respectively. The 15-year cumulative incidence rates of death not due and due to prostate cancer were 14% and 5%, respectively. A greater risk of death due to prostate cancer was conferred by increasing age at therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.1, P < 0.001), advanced clinical stages relative to T1a-T2a (HR 1.9, P = 0.048 for T2b; HR 2.7, P = 0.023 for T2c-T3b) and a 48-month PSA level >1.0 ng/mL (HR 6.8, P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   This study constitutes the largest retrospective analyses of long-term mortality outcomes from prospectively collected prostate brachytherapy data and confirms the excellent treatment efficacy of LDR prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.

Cabazitaxel (CBZ) is recommended as one of the most active chemotherapy agents for PCa. This study aimed to develop a hyaluronic acid (HA) decorated, cabazitaxel-prodrug (HA-CBZ) and orlistat (ORL) co-loaded nano-system against the prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Cabazitaxel-prodrug was firstly synthesized by conjugating HA with CBZ through the formation of ester bonds. HA contained ORL and CBZ prodrug co-loaded lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (ORL/HA-CBZ/LPNs) were constructed and characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential, drug loading capacity and stability. The antitumor efficiency and systemic toxicity of LPNs were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   The resulting ORL/HA-CBZ/LPNs were 150.9 nm in particle size with narrow distribution and high entrapment efficiency. The minimum combination index of 0.57 was found at a drug ratio of 1:2 (ORL:HA-CBZ, w/w) in the drug co-loaded formulations, indicating the strongest synergism effect. ORL/HA-CBZ/LPNs demonstrated an enhanced in vitro and in vivo antitumor effect compared with single drug loaded LPNs and free drug formulations.  Conclusion:   ORL/HA-CBZ/LPNs showed remarkable synergism cytotoxicity and the best tumor inhibition efficiency in mice with negligible systemic toxicity.

Primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients experiencing a complete pain response (score of 0 on the BPI-SF Worst pain item and no increase in daily use of analgesics). A complete or partial pain response (better BPI-SF score and decrease in opioid use) and a better or no change in HRQoL was evaluated as an integrated overall clinical response (IOCR).

Although software segmentation tools can delineate whole-body MTV, a necessary step toward meaningful monitoring of total tumor burden and treatment response through PET is establishing the repeatability of these metrics. The present study assessed the repeatability of total MTV and related metrics for 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in prostate cancer. Methods: Eighteen patients from a prior repeatability study who underwent 2 test-retest PSMA PET/CT scans within a mean interval of 5 d were reanalyzed. Within-subject coefficient of variation and repeatability coefficients (RCs) were analyzed on a per-lesion and per-patient basis. For the per-lesion analysis, individual lesions were segmented for analysis by a single reader. For the per-patient analysis, subgroups of up to 10 lesions (single reader) and the total tumor volume per patient were segmented (independently by 2 readers). Image parameters were MTV, SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, total lesion PSMA, and the related metric PSMA quotient (which integrates lesion volume and PSMA avidity). Results: In total, 192 segmentations were analyzed for the per-lesion analysis and 1,662 segmentations for the per-patient analysis (combining the 2 readers and 2 scans). The RC of the MTV of single lesions was 77% (95% CI, 63%-96%). The RC improved to 33% after aggregation of up to 10 manually selected lesions into subgroups assessed per patient (95% CI, 25%-46%). The RC of the semiautomatic MTVtotal (the sum of all voxels in the whole-body total tumor segmentation per patient) was 35% (95% CI, 25%-50%), the Bland-Altman bias was -6.70 (95% CI, -14.32-0.93). Alternating readers between scans led to a comparable RC of 37% (95% CI, 28%-49%) for MTVtotal, meaning that the metric is robust between scanning sessions and between readers. Conclusion:68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET-derived semiautomatic MTVtotal is repeatable and reader-independent, with a change of ±35% representing a true change in tumor volume. Volumetry of single manually selected lesions has considerably lower repeatability, and volumetry based on subgroups of these lesions, although showing acceptable repeatability, is less systematic. The semiautomatic analysis of MTVtotal used in this study offers an efficient and robust means of assessing response to therapy.""","""['Robert Seifert', 'Patrick Sandach', 'David Kersting', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Ken Herrmann', 'John J Sunderland', 'Janet H Pollard']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Quantitative Test-Retest Measurement of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in Tumor and Normal Tissue.', 'Repeatability of Quantitative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Measurements in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Combined Early and Late 68GaPSMA-HBED-CC PET Scans Improve Lesion Detectability in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer with Low PSA Levels.', 'High SUVs Have More Robust Repeatability in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Results from a Prospective Test-Retest Cohort Imaged with 18F-DCFPyL.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Reliability of gradient-based segmentation for measuring metabolic parameters influenced by uptake time on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 SPECT/CT Quantitation as a Response Biomarker Within a Prospective 177Lu-PSMA-617 and NOX66 Combination Trial (LuPIN).', 'Total Tumor Volume on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET as Additional Imaging Biomarker in mCRPC Patients Undergoing PSMA-Targeted Alpha Therapy with 225Ac-PSMA-I&T.']"""

Several previous studies have highlighted the involvement of the MEN1 gene in PCa. In the current study, we focused on its role specifically in AR-independent PCa cells.  Methods:   Cell tumorigenic features were evaluated by proliferation assay, foci formation, colony formation in soft agar, wound healing assay and xenograft experiments in mice. Quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot and immunostaining were performed to determine the expression of different factors in human PCa lines. Different ChIP-qPCR-based assays were carried out to dissect the action of JunD and β-catenin.  Results:   We found that MEN1 silencing in AR-independent cell lines, DU145 and PC3, resulted in an increase in anchorage independence and cell migration, accompanied by sustained MYC expression. By searching for factors known to positively regulate MYC expression and play a relevant role in PCa development and progression, we uncovered that MEN1-KD triggered the nuclear translocation of JunD and β-catenin. ChIP and 3C analyses further demonstrated that MEN1-KD led to, on the one hand, augmented binding of JunD to the MYC 5' enhancer and increased formation of loop structure, and on the other hand, increased binding of β-catenin to the MYC promoter. Moreover, the expression of several molecular markers of EMT, including E-cadherin, BMI1, Twist1 and HIF-1α, was altered in MEN1-KD DU145 and PC3 cells. In addition, analyses using cultured cells and PC3-GFP xenografts in mice demonstrated that JunD and β-catenin are necessary for the altered tumorigenic potential triggered by MEN1 inactivation in AR-independent PCa cells. Finally, we observed a significant negative clinical correlation between MEN1 and CTNNB1 mRNA expression in primary PCa and mCRPC datasets.

The a priori target rate was ≥76%. We used population-based data to explore factors associated with not receiving multidisciplinary care prior to radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Men who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer in Ontario between 2007 and 2017 were identified using administrative data. Physician billings identified patients who received multidisciplinary care. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict receipt of multidisciplinary care.  Results:   A total of 31,485 men underwent radical prostatectomy between 2007 and 2017. Of these patients 28.7% saw a radiation oncologist, 1.2% underwent multidisciplinary discussion and 1.9% had both before surgery. Multidisciplinary care receipt increased from 17.8% in 2007 to 47.8% in 2017 (p <0.001). The odds ratio between the highest and lowest geographic regions was 7.93 (95% CI 6.17-10.18, p <0.001). Lower odds of multidisciplinary care receipt were observed for men further from the nearest cancer center (OR 0.74 per 50 km, 95% CI 0.71-0.78, p <0.001) and higher odds for the highest versus lowest income quintile (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.29-1.54, p <0.001). Of 128 urologists who performed ≥10 radical prostatectomies between 2016 and 2017, 29 (22.7%) met the target of having ≥76% of men seen for multidisciplinary care prior to surgery.  Conclusions:   Despite increasing utilization, many men do not receive multidisciplinary care prior to radical prostatectomy. While geography and the urologist appear to be the greatest factors predicting multidisciplinary care receipt, these factors are closely intertwined.""","""['Mark T Corkum', 'D Andrew Loblaw', 'Gerard Morton', 'Alexander V Louie', 'Rachel Glicksman', 'Joseph Chin', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Robert E Dinniwell', 'Barbara Fisher', 'Refik Saskin', 'Andrew Warner', 'George B Rodrigues']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'A Comparison Between the Rates of Radiation Oncologist and Urologist Consultations in Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer in Northern Ontario, Canada.', ""Urologists' referral and radiation oncologists' treatment patterns regarding high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy within 6 months after radical prostatectomy: A prospective cohort analysis."", 'The effect of selection and referral biases for the treatment of localised prostate cancer with surgery or radiation.', 'Physician visits prior to treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'The role of androgen ablation in patients with biochemical or local failure after definitive radiation therapy: a survey of practice patterns of urologists and radiation oncologists in the United States.', 'A Comparison Between the Rates of Radiation Oncologist and Urologist Consultations in Men Diagnosed With Prostate Cancer in Northern Ontario, Canada.']"""

However, the redundancy of molecules in the discovery process represents a serious issue. The untargeted approach, One Strain Many Compounds (OSMAC), is one of the most promising strategies to induce the expression of silent genes, especially when combined with genome mining and advanced metabolomics analysis. In this work, the whole genome of the marine isolate Rhodococcus sp. I2R was sequenced and analyzed by antiSMASH for the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters. The strain was cultivated in 22 different growth media and the generated extracts were subjected to metabolomic analysis and functional screening. Notably, only a single growth condition induced the production of unique compounds, which were partially purified and structurally characterized by liquid chromatography high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS). This strategy led to identifying a bioactive fraction containing >30 new glycolipids holding unusual functional groups. The active fraction showed a potent antiviral effect against enveloped viruses, such as herpes simplex virus and human coronaviruses, and high antiproliferative activity in PC3 prostate cancer cell line.

The aim of the present work was to explain complex oxidation processes that have been simulated during voltammetric experiments for our new thiolated genistein analog (TGE) that formed the self-assembled monolayer (SAM) on the gold electrode. The thiol linker assured a strong interaction of sulfur nucleophiles with the gold surface. The research comprised of the study of TGE oxidative properties, IR-ATR, and MALDI-TOF measurements of SAM before and after electrochemical oxidation. TGE has been shown to be electrochemically active. It undergoes one irreversible oxidation reaction and one quasi-reversible oxidation reaction in PBS buffer at pH 7.4. The oxidation of TGE results in electroactive products composed likely from TGE conjugates (e.g., trimers) as part of polymer. The electroactive centers of TGE and its oxidation mechanism were discussed using IR supported by quantum chemical and molecular mechanics calculations. Preliminary in-vitro studies indicate that TGE exhibits higher cytotoxic activity towards DU145 human prostate cancer cells and is safer for normal prostate epithelial cells (PNT2) than genistein itself.""","""['Elżbieta U Stolarczyk', 'Weronika Strzempek', 'Marta Łaszcz', 'Andrzej Leś', 'Elżbieta Menaszek', 'Katarzyna Sidoryk', 'Krzysztof Stolarczyk']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Thiogenistein-Antioxidant Chemistry, Antitumor Activity, and Structure Elucidation of New Oxidation Products.', 'Electrocatalytic oxidation of dihydronicotineamide adenine dinucleotide on gold electrode modified with catechol-terminated alkanethiol self-assembly.', 'Direct determination of brucine by square wave voltammetry on 4-amino-2-mercaptopyrimidine self-assembled monolayer gold electrode.', 'Anticarcinogenic actions of melatonin which involve antioxidative processes: comparison with other antioxidants.', 'Genistein as antioxidant and antibrowning agents in in vivo and in vitro: A review.', 'Interventions on soy isoflavone molecules to improve their therapeutic potential for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Thiogenistein-Antioxidant Chemistry, Antitumor Activity, and Structure Elucidation of New Oxidation Products.', 'Novel Strategies in the Development of New Therapies, Drug Substances, and Drug Carriers Volume I.']"""

Dichloroacetate (DCA), a prototypical PDK inhibitor, reduces the abundance of some PDK isoenzymes. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully characterized and may differ across cell types. We determined that DCA reduced the abundance of PDK1 in breast (MDA-MB-231) and prostate (PC-3) cancer cells, while it suppressed both PDK1 and PDK2 in skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes). The DCA-induced PDK1 suppression was partially dependent on hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a transcriptional regulator of PDK1, in cancer cells but not in L6 myotubes. However, the DCA-induced alterations in the mRNA and the protein levels of PDK1 and/or PDK2 did not always occur in parallel, implicating a role for post-transcriptional mechanisms. DCA did not inhibit the mTOR signaling, while inhibitors of the proteasome or gene silencing of mitochondrial proteases CLPP and AFG3L2 did not prevent the DCA-induced reduction of the PDK1 protein levels. Collectively, our results suggest that DCA reduces the abundance of PDK in an isoform-dependent manner via transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.

This approach is restricted by the breadth of immunity elicited to a single antigen, and to cancers that have a defined tumor associated antigen. Other multi-antigen approaches have been restricted by poor efficacy of vaccine adjuvants. We have developed a vaccine platform that consists of autologous DCs pulsed with cytokine-adjuvanted tumor membrane vesicles (TMVs) made from tumor tissue, that encapsulate the antigenic landscape of individual tumors. Here we test the efficacy of DCs pulsed with TMVs incorporated with glycolipid-anchored immunostimulatory molecules (GPI-ISMs) in HER2-positive and triple negative breast cancer murine models. Pulsing of DCs with TMVs containing GPI-ISMs results in superior uptake of vesicles, DC activation and cytokine production. Adaptive transfer of TMV-pulsed DCs to tumor bearing mice results in the inhibition of tumor growth, reduction in lung metastasis, and an increase in immune cell infiltration into the tumors.

Here, CK exerted significant cytotoxicity without hurting RWPE1 normal prostate epithelial cells, increased sub-G1 and cleavage of Poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and attenuated the expression of pro-PARP and Pro-cysteine aspartyl-specific protease3 (pro-caspase-3) in LANCap, PC-3 and DU145 cells. Further, CK attenuated the expression of p-STAT3 and PD-L1 in DU145 cells along with disrupted the binding of STAT3 to PD-L1. Furthermore, CK effectively abrogated the expression of p-STAT3 and PD-L1 in interferon-gamma (INF-γ)-stimulated DU145cells. Additionally, CK suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) as immune escape-related genes in DU145 cells. Likewise, as STAT3 targets genes, the expression of CyclinD1, c-Myc and B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) was attenuated in CK-treated DU145 cells. Notably, CK upregulated the expression of microRNA193a-5p (miR193a-5p) in DU145 cells. Consistently, miR193a-5p mimic suppressed p-STAT3, PD-L1 and pro-PARP, while miR193a-5p inhibitor reversed the ability of CK to attenuate the expression of p-STAT3, PD-L1 and pro-PARP in DU145 cells.

Our aim was to compare the concordance rates among the Idylla™ MSI test, TapeStation 4200, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis in assessing MSI-H/dMMR status in EC, GC, OC, PrC, and PaC patients. The Sanger sequencing-based Titano MSI test was used in discordant cases. One hundred and eighty-five cases (n = 40 PrC, n = 39 GC, n = 38 OC, n = 35 PaC, and n = 33 EC) were retrospectively selected. MMR protein expression was evaluated by IHC. After DNA quality and quantity evaluations, the IdyllaTM and TapeStation 4200 platforms were adopted for the evaluation of MSI status. Remarkably, compared to IHC, the Idylla™ platform achieved a global concordance rate of 94.5% (154/163) for the microsatellite stable (MSS)/proficient MMR (pMMR) cases and 77.3% (17/22) for the MSI-H/dMMR cases. Similarly, a global concordance rate of 91.4% (149/163) and 68.2% (15/22) for MSS/pMMR and MSI-H/dMMR cases was also identified between IHC and the TapeStation 4200 microfluidic system. In addition, a global concordance of 93.1% (148/159) and 69.2% (18/26) for MSS/pMMR and MSI-H/dMMR cases was observed between the Idylla™ and TapeStation 4200 platforms.

The concentration on invasion and metastasis can be one of the most meaningful advancements in cancer investigation. Importantly, metastasis-free survival (MFS) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a novel primary endpoint in clinical trials and has been used to evaluate the prognosis of patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and soft tissue sarcoma. This new definition enables to shift the focus of research and development in cancer therapeutics toward metastasis and to change the emphasis from using tumor shrinkage as a benchmark for indicating the efficacy of treatment to using MFS as a more representative endpoint for antimetastatic drugs. This perspective outlines the possibility to use this novel endpoint in other solid cancers, and examples of large clinical trials are given in which MFS is defined as an endpoint and/or in which antimetastatic strategies are being examined. These advances now open the door for the rapid development of antimetastatic therapies, which could be used in combination with standard cytotoxic cancer therapies. With pioneer research on metastasis prevention on the rise and the underlying biomechanisms of tumor cell motility and invasion explored further than ever before, we believe an intensified focus on antimetastatic properties will shape this era of cancer translational research.""","""['Jonathan Solomon', 'Magdalena Raškova', 'Daniel Rösel', 'Jan Brábek', 'Hava Gil-Henn']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Migrastatics-Anti-metastatic and Anti-invasion Drugs: Promises and Challenges.', 'Metastasis-free survival as a\xa0new endpoint in castration- -resistant prostate cancer.', 'Marine Migrastatics: A Comprehensive 2022 Update.', 'Metastasis-free Survival-Progress or Lowering the Bar on Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer?', 'Migrastatics: Redirecting R&D in Solid Cancer Towards Metastasis?', 'Myo-Inositol Reverses TGF-β1-Induced EMT in MCF-10A Non-Tumorigenic Breast Cells.', 'Adopted neoplastic cells and the consequences of their existence.', 'The emerging role of microtubules in invasion plasticity.', 'Cabazitaxel-Loaded Nanoparticles Reduce the Invasiveness in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells: Beyond the Classical Taxane Function.', 'How does plasticity of migration help tumor cells to avoid treatment: Cytoskeletal regulators and potential markers.']"""

Our results demonstrate that IgG from PC sera bind to PLG-H but not to PLG-L.

ING3 was reported to act as a tumour suppressor in many different cancer types to regulate apoptosis. On the other hand, ING3 levels positively correlate with poor survival prognosis of prostate cancer (PCa) patients. In PCa cells, ING3 acts rather as an androgen receptor (AR) co-activator and harbours oncogenic properties in PCa. Here, we show the identification of a novel ING3 splice variant in both the human PCa cell line LNCaP and in human PCa patient specimen. The novel ING3 splice variant lacks exon 11, ING3∆ex11, which results in deletion of the PHD, providing a unique opportunity to analyse functionally the PHD of ING3 by a natural splice variant. Functionally, overexpression of ING3Δex11 induced morphological changes of LNCaP-derived 3D spheroids with generation of lumen and pore-like structures within spheroids. Since these structures are an indicator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), key regulatory factors and markers for EMT were analysed. The data suggest that in contrast to ING3, ING3Δex11 specifically modulates the expression of key EMT-regulating upstream transcription factors and induces the expression of EMT markers, indicating that the PHD of ING3 inhibits EMT. In line with this, ING3 knockdown also induced the expression of EMT markers, confirming the impact of ING3 on EMT regulation. Further, ING3 knockdown induced cellular senescence via a pathway leading to cell cycle arrest, indicating an oncogenic role for ING3 in PCa. Thus, the data suggest that the ING3Δex11 splice variant lacking functional PHD exhibits oncogenic characteristics through triggering EMT in PCa cells.""","""['Anna Melekhova', 'Mirjam Leeder', 'Thanakorn Pungsrinont', 'Tim Schmäche', 'Julia Kallenbach', 'Marzieh Ehsani', 'Kimia Mirzakhani', 'Seyed Mohammad Mahdi Rasa', 'Francesco Neri', 'Aria Baniahmad']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.', 'ING3 promotes prostate cancer growth by activating the androgen receptor.', 'ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients.', 'Human ex vivo prostate tissue model system identifies ING3 as an oncoprotein.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'Prognostic significance of ING3 expression in patients with cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Molecular mechanisms of inhibitor of growth (ING) family members in health and malignancy.', 'Inhibitor of Growth Factors Regulate Cellular Senescence.', 'ING Tumour Suppressors and ING Splice Variants as Coregulators of the Androgen Receptor Signalling in Prostate Cancer.']"""

The androgen receptor (AR) is a key drug target controlling PCa growth and regulates hTERT expression, but is described to either inhibit or to activate. Here, we reveal that androgens repress and activate hTERT expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Physiological low androgen levels activate, while, notably, supraphysiological androgen levels (SAL), used in bipolar androgen therapy (BAT), repress hTERT expression. We confirmed the SAL-mediated gene repression of hTERT in PCa cell lines, native human PCa samples derived from patients treated ex vivo, as well as in cancer spheroids derived from androgen-dependent or castration resistant PCa (CRPC) cells. Interestingly, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) combined with functional assays revealed a positive (pARE) and a negative androgen response element (nARE).

Castration resistance and metastasis are clinical challenges and continue to impede therapeutic success, despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances. There are reports of the oncogenic activity of genetic suppressor element (GSE)1 in breast and gastric cancers; however, its role in therapy resistance, metastasis, and susceptibility to disease recurrence in PCa patients remains unclear.  Objective:   this study investigated the role of aberrantly expressed GSE1 in the metastasis, therapy resistance, relapse, and poor prognosis of advanced PCa.  Methods:   we used a large cohort of multi-omics data and in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays to investigate the potential effect of altered GSE1 expression on advanced/castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) treatment responses, disease progression, and prognosis.  Results:   using a multi-cohort approach, we showed that GSE1 is upregulated in PCa, while tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TACSTD2) is downregulated. Moreover, the direct, but inverse, correlation interaction between GSE1 and TACSTD2 drives metastatic disease, castration resistance, and disease progression and modulates the clinical and immune statuses of patients with PCa. Patients with GSE1highTACSTD2low expression are more prone to recurrence and disease-specific death than their GSE1lowTACSTD2high counterparts. Interestingly, we found that the GSE1-TACSTD2 expression profile is associated with the therapy responses and clinical outcomes in patients with PCa, especially those with metastatic/recurrent disease. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the shRNA-mediated targeting of GSE1 (shGSE1) significantly inhibits cell proliferation and attenuates cell migration and tumorsphere formation in metastatic PC3 and DU145 cell lines, with an associated suppression of VIM, SNAI2, and BCL2 and the concomitant upregulation of TACSTD2 and BAX. Moreover, shGSE1 enhances sensitivity to the antiandrogens abiraterone and enzalutamide in vitro and in vivo.  Conclusion:   these data provide preclinical evidence of the oncogenic role of dysregulated GSE1-TACSTD2 signaling and show that the molecular or pharmacological targeting of GSE1 is a workable therapeutic strategy for inhibiting androgen-driven oncogenic signals, re-sensitizing CRPC to treatment, and repressing the metastatic/recurrent phenotypes of patients with PCa.""","""['Oluwaseun Adebayo Bamodu', 'Yuan-Hung Wang', 'Chen-Hsun Ho', 'Su-Wei Hu', 'Chia-Da Lin', 'Kai-Yi Tzou', 'Wen-Ling Wu', 'Kuan-Chou Chen', 'Chia-Chang Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Differential but Concerted Expression of HSD17B2, HSD17B3, SHBG and SRD5A1 Testosterone Tetrad Modulate Therapy Response and Susceptibility to Disease Relapse in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'MYBL2 disrupts the Hippo-YAP pathway and confers castration resistance and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.']"""

Methods:   Data were collected from three clinical studies in mCRPC patients treated with abiraterone acetate. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the relation between abiraterone exposure and survival (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]). An interaction term was used to test whether chemotherapy pretreatment was an effect modifier. To investigate the effect of the previously defined exposure threshold of 8.4 ng/mL on survival, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used.  Results:   In total, 98 mCRPC patients were included, of which 78 were pre-chemotherapy and 20 were post-chemotherapy patients. Chemotherapy pretreatment in mCRPC setting appears to be an effect modifier. In pre-chemotherapy patients, no significant association between abiraterone exposure and survival was observed (HR 0.68 [95% CI 0.42-1.10], P = .12 and HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.46-1.60], P = .61, PFS and OS, respectively) and no longer survival was seen for patients with an abiraterone exposure above the predefined threshold. In contrast, a significant association was seen in post-chemotherapy patients (HR 0.30 [95% CI 0.12-0.74], P = .01 and HR 0.38 [95% CI 0.18-0.82] P = .01, PFS and OS, respectively), with an increased survival when exposed above this threshold.  Conclusion:   Chemotherapy pretreatment in mCRPC setting modifies the abiraterone exposure-response relation.

Here we examine the role of surgery alone, compared to other types of treatment modalities in this association in a population-based sample of men with prostate or other types of cancer.  Methods:   A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a subsample of 632 male participants aged 36-69 from the 2009-2015 survey cycle of the Atlantic PATH cohort study. The primary outcomes were the presence of mild, moderate or severe depression or anxiety indicators and were assessed using the seven-item generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7) scale and the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. The presence of a lifetime history of PCa or other form of cancer (except PCa) was the main predictor variable and was assessed in cancer treatment modality (surgery or other types of treatment modalities) stratified analyses. Covariates included age, marital status, household income, comorbidity, and survivorship time.  Results:   The presence of depression in this sample was prevalent among 17.7% of men, and of anxiety among 9.3% of men. Survivors who were treated with surgery for their PCa diagnosis had 7.55 statistically significantly higher odds of screening positive for current depression symptoms compared with those of other forms of cancer in controlled analyses.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is also male-dominant, but the role of AR in HCC remains poorly understood. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) also has been reported to be highly activated in HCC. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of AR phosphorylation and its relationship with mTORC1 in hepatocarcinogenesis.  Approach and results:   In vitro experiment, we observed that mTORC1 interacts with hepatic AR and phosphorylates it at S96 in response to nutrient and mitogenic stimuli in HCC cells. S96 phosphorylation promotes the stability, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activity of AR, which enhances de novo lipogenesis and proliferation in hepatocytes and induces liver steatosis and hepatocarcinogenesis in mice independently and cooperatively with androgen. Furthermore, high ARS96 phosphorylation is observed in human liver steatotic and HCC tissues and is associated with overall survival and disease-free survival, which has been proven as an independent survival predictor for patients with HCC.  Conclusions:   AR S96 phosphorylation by mTORC1 drives liver steatosis and HCC development and progression independently and cooperatively with androgen, which not only explains why HCC is man-biased but also provides a target molecule for prevention and treatment of HCC and a potential survival predictor in patients with HCC.""","""['Qian-Nan Ren', 'Hong Zhang', 'Chao-Yue Sun', 'Yu-Feng Zhou', 'Xue-Feng Yang', 'Jian-Wu Long', 'Xiao-Xing Li', 'Shi-Juan Mai', 'Mei-Yin Zhang', 'Hui-Zhong Zhang', 'Hai-Qiang Mai', 'Min-Shan Chen', 'X F Steven Zheng', 'Hui-Yun Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Hepatology""","""['Hepatic androgen receptor suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis through modulation of cell migration and anoikis.', 'Persistent mTORC1 activation via Depdc5 deletion results in spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma but does not exacerbate carcinogen- and high-fat diet-induced hepatic carcinogenesis in mice.', 'Androgen receptor is a new potential therapeutic target for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Androgen receptor signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancers.', 'Androgen receptor roles in hepatocellular carcinoma, fatty liver, cirrhosis and hepatitis.', 'Constitutively Active Androgen Receptor in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Orlistat Resensitizes Sorafenib-Resistance in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells through Modulating Metabolism.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data of 170 mCRPC patients receiving abiraterone or docetaxel as first-line therapy. PSA response, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and overall survival (OS) were analyzed based on the presence of IDC-P and its subpatterns.  Results:   IDC-P was confirmed in 91/170 (53.5%) patients. Among them 36/91 (39.6%) and 55/91 (60.4%) harbored IDC-P patterns 1 and 2, respectively. Patients with IDC-P pattern 1 shared similar clinical outcomes to those without IDC-P in both abiraterone and docetaxel treatment. However, against cases without IDC-P or with IDC-P pattern 1, patients with IDC-P pattern 2 had markedly poorer prognosis in either abiraterone (mPSA-PFS: 11.9 vs. 11.1 vs. 6.1 months, p < 0.001; mrPFS: 18.9 vs. 19.4 vs. 9.6 months, p < 0.001) or docetaxel (mPSA-PFS: 6.2 vs. 6.6 vs. 3.0 months, p < 0.001; mrPFS: 15.1 vs. 12.6 vs. 5.5 months, p < 0.001) treatment. For patients without IDC-P, docetaxel had comparable therapeutic efficacy with abiraterone. However, the efficacy of docetaxel was significantly inferior to abiraterone in patients with either IDC-P pattern 1 (mPSA-PFS: 6.6 vs. 11.1 months, p = 0.021; mrPFS: 12.6 vs. 19.4 months, p = 0.027) or pattern 2 (mPSA-PFS: 3.0 vs. 6.1 months, p = 0.003; mrPFS: 5.5 vs. 9.6 months, p = 0.007).

Radiotherapy has been shown to modulate immune-related genes dependent on the fractionation regimen. To identify long-term changes in gene expression after irradiation, PC3 (p53 deleted) and LNCaP (p53 wildtype) prostate cancer cells were irradiated with either a single dose (SD, 10 Gy) or a fractionated regimen (MF) of 10 fractions (1 Gy per fraction). Whole human genome arrays were used to determine gene expression at 24 h and 2 months after irradiation. Immune pathway activation was analyzed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Additionally, 3D colony formation assays and T-cell cytotoxicity assays were performed. LNCaP had a higher basal expression of immunogenic genes and was more efficiently killed by cytotoxic T-cells compared to PC3. In both cell lines, MF irradiation resulted in an increase in multiple immune-related genes immediately after irradiation, while at 2 months, SD irradiation had a more pronounced effect on radiation-induced gene expression. Both immunogenic and immunosuppressive genes were upregulated in the long term in PC3 cells by a 10 Gy SD irradiation but not in LNCaP. T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly increased in 10 Gy SD PC3 cells compared to the unirradiated control and could be further enhanced by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

In this study, we report that plasma-derived circulating vesicles consisting of CD9 and double-positive for CD9 and Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) are increased in patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer, whereas double positives for CD9 and CD63 small extracellular vesicles (S-EVs) are significantly higher in patients with localised prostate cancer. Androgen manipulation by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the clinical antagonist enzalutamide (ENZ) altered the heterogeneity and size of CD9 positive S-EVs in AR expressing prostate cancer cells, while assessment of the total number and protein cargo of total S-EVs was unaltered across different treatment groups. Furthermore, hormone stimulation caused strong and specific effects on the small RNA cargo of S-EVs. A total of 543 small RNAs were found to be regulated by androgens including miR-19-3p and miR-361-5p.

Univariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard model indicated that newly developed diabetes mellitus (DM) following hormone therapy (postDM), but not preexisting DM, as well as PC characteristics at initial diagnosis including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≥ 18 were significantly associated with the progression to CRPC. A similar tendency was also observed in the relationship between newly developed hypertension following hormone therapy and CRPC progression. On the other hand, neither dyslipidemia nor hyperuricemia, regardless the onset timing, exhibited any association with CRPC progression. In multivariate analysis, postDM and PSA ≥ 18 were extracted as independent risk factors for CRPC progression (adjusted hazard ratios, 3.38 and 2.34; p values, 0.016 and 0.019, respectively). Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test clearly indicated earlier progression to CRPC in PC patients who developed postDM or had relatively advanced initial PC characteristics including PSA ≥ 18.

For example, A-to-I editing of microRNAs through adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes can affect their expression levels and functional roles, but editing isoform-specific assays are not commercially available. Here, we describe RT-qPCR assays that are specific for editing isoforms, using microRNA-379 (miR-379) as a model. The assays are based on two-tailed RT-qPCR, and we show them to be compatible both with SYBR Green and hydrolysis-based chemistries, as well as with both qPCR and digital PCR. The assays could readily detect different miR-379 editing isoforms in various human tissues as well as changes of editing levels in ADAR-overexpressing cell lines. We found that the miR-379 editing frequency was higher in prostate cancer samples compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. Furthermore, decreased expression of unedited miR-379, but not edited miR-379, was associated with treatment resistance, metastasis, and shorter overall survival.

While these events are rare, we sought to perform a retrospective analysis of these cases to ascertain the reasons that MRI-targeted biopsy missed clinically significant cancer which was subsequently detected on systematic prostate biopsy.  Materials and methods:   Patients were enrolled in a prospective study comparing cancer detection rates by transrectal MRI-targeted fusion biopsy and systematic 12-core biopsy. Patients with an elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA), abnormal digital rectal examination, or imaging findings concerning for prostate cancer underwent prostate MRI and subsequent MRI-targeted and systematic biopsy in the same setting. The subset of patients with grade group (GG) ≥3 cancer found on systematic biopsy and GG ≤2 cancer (or no cancer) on MRI-targeted biopsy was classified as MRI-targeted biopsy misses. A retrospective analysis of the MRI and MRI-targeted biopsy real-time screen captures determined the cause of MRI-targeted biopsy miss. Multivariable logistic regression analysis compared baseline characteristics of patients with MRI-targeted biopsy misses to GG-matched patients whose clinically significant cancer was detected by MRI-targeted biopsy.  Results:   Over the study period of 2007 to 2019, 2,103 patients met study inclusion criteria and underwent combined MRI-targeted and systematic prostate biopsies. A total of 41 (1.9%) men were classified as MRI-targeted biopsy misses. Most MRI-targeted biopsy misses were due to errors in lesion targeting (21, 51.2%), followed by MRI-invisible lesions (17, 40.5%) and MRI lesions missed by the radiologist (3, 7.1%). On logistic regression analysis, lower Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADSTM) score was associated with having clinically significant cancer missed on MRI-targeted biopsy.  Conclusions:   While uncommon, most MRI-targeted biopsy misses are due to errors in lesion targeting, which highlights the importance of accurate co-registration and targeting when using software-based fusion platforms. Additionally, some patients will harbor MRI-invisible lesions which are untargetable by MRI-targeted platforms.

Studies on the effect of castration and androgen receptor blockade have been mixed, while 5α-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) use in men with COVID-19 (2019 novel coronavirus) have shown potential benefits. We assessed the association of 5ARI use on risk of community acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Materials and methods:   A total of 60,474 males in a prospective registry of people tested for SARS-CoV-2 between March 8, 2020 and February 15, 2021 were included. Using a matched cohort design, men using 5ARIs were matched 1:1 to non5ARI users. Independent analysis using unconditional multivariable logistic regression on the entire unmatched data set was completed for validation. Primary outcome measures were the association of 5ARI use on rates of SARS-Cov-2 positivity and disease severity.  Results:   Of the men 1,079 (1.8%) reported 5ARI use and 55,100 were available for matching. The final matched cohorts included 944 men each. Mean duration of use was 60.4 months (IQR 17-84 months). Absolute risk for infection was significantly lower in 5ARI users compared to nonusers, 42.3% (399/944) vs 47.2% (446/944), respectively (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 4.9%, OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.97, p=0.026). Unconditional multivariable logistic regression analysis of the entire study cohort of 55,100 men confirmed the protective association of 5ARI use (ARR 5.3%, OR=0.877, 95% CI 0.774-0.995, p=0.042).

Regions of interest (ROI) were placed on suspicious lesions on MRI scans. ROIs were then correlated to pathological results based on core biopsy location. The final tumor count is a total: 23 of GS 6 (3 + 3), 36 of GS 7 (3 + 4), 18 of GS 7 (4 + 3), and 19 of GS ≥ 8. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans were fitted into the FROC and monoexponential model to calculate ADC and FROC parameters: anomalous diffusion coefficient D, intravoxel diffusion heterogeneity β, and spatial parameter μ. The performance of FROC parameters and ADC at differentiating PCa grade was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   In differentiating low (GS 6) vs. intermediate (GS 7) risk PZ PCa, combination of (D, β) provides the best performance with AUC of 0.829 with significance of p = 0.018 when compared to ADC (AUC of 0.655).

In the current study, we analytically validated aPROMISE, a software as a medical device that segments organs in low-dose CT images with deep learning, and subsequently detects and quantifies potential pathological lesions in PSMA PET/CT.  Methods:   To evaluate the deep learning algorithm, the automated segmentations of the low-dose CT component of PSMA PET/CT scans from 20 patients were compared to manual segmentations. Dice scores were used to quantify the similarities between the automated and manual segmentations. Next, the automated quantification of tracer uptake in the reference organs and detection and pre-segmentation of potential lesions were evaluated in 339 patients with prostate cancer, who were all enrolled in the phase II/III OSPREY study. Three nuclear medicine physicians performed the retrospective independent reads of OSPREY images with aPROMISE. Quantitative consistency was assessed by the pairwise Pearson correlations and standard deviation between the readers and aPROMISE. The sensitivity of detection and pre-segmentation of potential lesions was evaluated by determining the percent of manually selected abnormal lesions that were automatically detected by aPROMISE.  Results:   The Dice scores for bone segmentations ranged from 0.88 to 0.95. The Dice scores of the PSMA PET/CT reference organs, thoracic aorta and liver, were 0.89 and 0.97, respectively. Dice scores of other visceral organs, including prostate, were observed to be above 0.79. The Pearson correlation for blood pool reference was higher between any manual reader and aPROMISE, than between any pair of manual readers. The standard deviations of reference organ uptake across all patients as determined by aPROMISE (SD = 0.21 blood pool and SD = 1.16 liver) were lower compared to those of the manual readers. Finally, the sensitivity of aPROMISE detection and pre-segmentation was 91.5% for regional lymph nodes, 90.6% for all lymph nodes, and 86.7% for bone in metastatic patients.  Conclusion:   In this analytical study, we demonstrated the segmentation accuracy of the deep learning algorithm, the consistency in quantitative assessment across multiple readers, and the high sensitivity in detecting potential lesions.

Purpose To compare the sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI with multiparametric MRI for detecting CSPC. Materials and Methods Men with prostate specific antigen levels of 2.5-20 ng/mL prospectively underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI, including multiparametric MRI sequences, between June 2019 and March 2020. Imaging was evaluated independently by two radiologists by using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1. Sensitivity and specificity for CSPC (International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥ 2) were compared for 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI and multiparametric MRI by using the McNemar test. Decision curve analysis compared the net benefit of each imaging strategy. Results Ninety-nine men (median age, 67 years; interquartile range, 62-71 years) were included; 79% (78 of 99) underwent biopsy. CSPC was detected in 32% (25 of 78). For CSPC, specificity was higher for 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI than multiparametric MRI (76% [95% CI: 62, 86] vs 49% [95% CI: 35, 63], respectively; P < .001). Sensitivity was similar (88% [95% CI: 69, 98] vs 92% [95% CI: 74, 99], respectively; P > .99). For PI-RADS 3 lesions, specificity was also higher for 68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI than for multiparametric MRI: 86% (95% CI: 73, 95) versus 59% (95% CI: 43, 74), respectively (P = .002). Decision curve analysis showed that biopsies targeted to PSMA uptake increased the net benefit of multiparametric MRI only among PI-RADS 3 lesions. The net benefit of targeted biopsy for a PI-RADS 3 lesion with PSMA uptake was higher across all threshold probabilities over 8%. The net benefit of targeted biopsy was similar for PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions, regardless of PSMA uptake. Conclusions Gallium 68 prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/MRI improved specificity for clinically significant prostate cancer compared with multiparametric MRI, particularly in Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System grade 3 lesions. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

We aimed to identify circulating tumor cells (CTC) signatures that could inform treatment decisions of patients with mCRPC with cabazitaxel-carboplatin combination therapy versus cabazitaxel alone. Liquid biopsy samples were collected prospectively from 79 patients for retrospective analysis. CTCs were detected, classified, enumerated through a computational pipeline followed by manual curation, and subjected to single-cell genome-wide copy-number profiling for AVPC-MS detection. On the basis of immunofluorescence intensities, detected rare cells were classified into 8 rare-cell groups. Further morphologic characterization categorized CTC subtypes from 4 cytokeratin-positive rare-cell groups, utilizing presence of mesenchymal features and platelet attachment. Of 79 cases, 77 (97.5%) had CTCs, 24 (30.4%) were positive for platelet-coated CTCs (pc.CTCs) and 25 (38.5%) of 65 sequenced patients exhibited AVPC-MS in CTCs. Survival analysis indicated that the presence of pc.CTCs identified the subset of patients who were AVPC-MS-positive with the worst prognosis and minimal benefit from combination therapy. In AVPC-MS-negative patients, its presence showed significant survival improvement from combination therapy.

Methods:   Ten patients undergoing sRARP after failure of the prior definitive proton beam therapy for localized prostate cancer were included. BCR is defined as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value of 2.0 ng/mL greater than the absolute nadir. All of the individuals had a diagnosis of prostate cancer via biopsy after proton beam therapy, with negative findings on magnetic resonance imaging/computer tomography of the pelvis and abdomen, and a bone scan. The sRARP procedure with pelvic lymph node dissection was performed by a single surgeon in all patients.  Results:   The median age of the cohort at sRARP was 66.8 years, and the mean BMI was 29.2 kg/m2. The mean duration from proton beam therapy to sRARP was 58.4 months; the mean preoperative PSA level was 5.5 ng/mL, the mean operative time was 230 minutes, and the approximate blood loss was 745 mL. Anastomotic leakage occurred in half of the individuals, and bladder neck contracture developed in 6 patients. For 8 patients, the continence results within 6 months followup were available. Overall, 24 complications occurred in 9 patients. At follow-up in the 32nd month, the overall survival rate was 80%, and the BCR-free survival rate was 90%.

We created a partnered strength training program, Exercising Together©, where the survivor and his/her partner exercise as a team in order to improve physical and mental health of both members of the couple as well as the quality of their relationship. We have not yet determined if Exercising Together© is similarly effective in couples coping with different types of cancer nor if training as a team has unique and added benefits over those derived from supervised group training and/or shared behavior change. The purpose of this study is to determine the unique benefits of Exercising Together© on physical, mental, and relational health in couples coping with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer.  Methods:   Survivors of prostate, breast and colorectal cancer (N = 294, 98 per cancer site) and their intimate, co-residing partners are recruited to participate in a single-blind, parallel group, randomized trial comparing three exercise groups that train twice per week for 6 months. Couples are randomized to one of three groups: (1) Exercising Together© where partners train as a team in a supervised group setting; (2) separate supervised group exercise classes for survivors or partners, respectively; (3) unsupervised home exercise program provided to each partner. The primary outcome is relationship quality (dyadic coping by the Dyadic Coping scale, emotional intimacy by the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, physical intimacy by the Physical Intimacy Behavior Scale, and symptom incongruence). Secondary outcomes are physical health (% body fat by DXA, serum fasting lipids (triglycerides, HDL, and LDL cholesterol), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), resting blood pressure, C-reactive protein, TNF alpha, and physical functioning by the short Physical Performance Battery and SF-36) and mental health (depressive symptoms, anxiety, fear of recurrence) of each partner. Outcomes are collected at baseline, mid (3 months), post-intervention (6 months), and follow-up (12 months).  Discussion:   Exercising Together© could shift the paradigm of survivorship care toward novel couple-based approaches that could optimize outcomes for each partner because their health is interdependent on each other and their relationship.

Avasimibe was recently identified as a promising drug for anticancer therapies. The main purpose of this study was to explore the effects and the underlying mechanisms of avasimibe in prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this study, MTT and clonogenic survival assays were performed to detect cell proliferation after avasimibe treatment. The effect of avasimibe on cell migration was measured by wound healing and transwell migration assays. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Immunofluorescence staining and western blot analysis were used to detect the expression of cell cycle-related proteins and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins. In vivo, the antitumour effects of avasimibe were evaluated using a xenograft model and pulmonary metastasis model.  Results:   The study found that avasimibe suppresses tumour growth and triggers G1 phase arrest. Moreover, the expression of the cell cycle-related proteins CDK2/4/6, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A1 + A2 was significantly increased and p21 expression was decreased after avasimibe treatment. The migration of PCa cells was attenuated after treatment with avasimibe, followed by the downregulation of the expression of the EMT-related proteins N-cadherin, β-catenin, vimentin, Snail and MMP9 and upregulation of E-cadherin expression. Moreover, E2F-1 was elevated after treatment with avasimibe. After knockdown of E2F-1 expression, the inhibition of cell proliferation and migration caused by avasimibe was significantly recovered. The results of the xenograft model showed that avasimibe suppressed tumour growth in vivo. Immunofluorescence staining revealed lower levels of Ki67 and higher levels of E2F-1 in tumour tissues of the avasimibe group than those of the control group. A pulmonary metastasis model also confirmed the inhibition of PCa metastasis by avasimibe. The number of lung metastatic foci in the avasimibe group was significantly decreased compared with that in the control group.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that avasimibe can suppress tumour proliferation and metastasis via the E2F-1 signalling pathway. These findings demonstrate the potential of avasimibe as a new effective drug for PCa treatment.""","""['Kangping Xiong', 'Gang Wang', 'Tianchen Peng', 'Fenfang Zhou', 'Siming Chen', 'Wei Liu', 'Lingao Ju', 'Yu Xiao', 'Kaiyu Qian', 'Xinghuan Wang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Cell Int""","""['Cardamonin inhibits the progression of oesophageal cancer by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.', 'CUL4B promotes metastasis and proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Baicalein suppresses metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting EMT via downregulation of SATB1 and Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 promotes proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Systematic review of antitumour efficacy and mechanism of metformin activity in prostate cancer models.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Repurposing Avasimibe to Inhibit Bacterial Glycosyltransferases.']"""

Recent studies have discovered multiple aberrantly expressed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cancers that may have regulatory roles in tumor pathogenesis and metastasis; however, the roles of some lncRNAs in PPGLs are still unknown. The expression levels of lncRNAs including metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript (MALAT1), prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3), and HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR) in PPGLs were analyzed by in situ hybridization, using two tissue microarrays (TMAs). The pheochromocytoma (PCC) TMA consisted of normal adrenal medulla (N = 25), non-metastatic PCCs (N = 76) and metastatic PCCs (N = 5) while the paraganglioma (PGL) TMA had 73 non-metastatic PGLs and 5 metastatic PGLs. Immunohistochemical staining was performed on all samples with an anti-SDHB antibody. The correlations between lncRNA expression, loss of SDHB expression and clinical characteristics including tumor progression and disease prognosis were investigated. The expression levels of MALAT1 and PCA3 were significantly elevated (2.5-3.9 folds) in both non-metastatic and metastatic PCCs compared to normal adrenal medulla, although there were no significant differences between the non-metastatic and metastatic neoplasms. In contrast to non-metastatic PGLs, metastatic PGLs had significantly upregulated expression of MALAT1, PCA3, and HOTAIR. SDHB loss was more frequently observed in PGLs (25 of 78), especially in metastatic PGLs (5 of 5), compared to PCCs (2 of 81) and in 0 of 5 metastatic PCCs. Patients with SDHB loss, in contrast to SDHB retained, were younger at diagnosis, had higher rates of tumor recurrence, metastatic disease, and mortality. In addition, PGLs with SDHB loss had significantly increased expression of PCA3 compared to tumors with intact SDHB expression.

PYCR1 and miR-1207-5p dysregulations were found in cancer progression. Our study aims to reveal the biological role of miR-1207-5p-PYCR1 axis in prostate cancer progression. First, we investigated the expression of miR-1207-5p in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines by RT-qPCR. Next, we confirmed miR-1207-5p targeting PYCR1 by luciferase assay. CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, flow cytometry, and tanswell assay were applied for examining cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in prostate cancer cells, respectively. In the present study, decreased miR-1207-5p expression was obviously observed in prostate cancer tissues and cells. Upregulation of miR-1207-5p hampered cellular proliferation and invasion, while enhanced cellular apoptosis. In addition, upregulation of PYCR1 elevated cell proliferation and invasion, but repressed apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. Moreover, miR-1207-5p inhibited the expression of PYCR1 to repress prostate cancer tumorigenesis.

Methods:   The analysis included eight cohorts that were linked to their respective cancer registries: France (AGRICAN: n = 128,101), the US (AHS: n = 51,165, MESA: n = 2,177), Norway (CNAP: n = 43,834), Australia (2 cohorts combined, Australian Pesticide Exposed Workers: n = 12,215 and Victorian Grain Farmers: n = 919), Republic of Korea (KMCC: n = 8,432), and Denmark (SUS: n = 1,899). For various cancer sites and all cancers combined, standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each cohort using national or regional rates as reference rates and were combined by random-effects meta-analysis.  Results:   During nearly 2,800,000 person-years, a total of 23,188 cancers were observed. Elevated risks were observed for melanoma of the skin (number of cohorts = 3, meta-SIR = 1.18, CI: 1.01-1.38) and multiple myeloma (n = 4, meta-SIR = 1.27, CI: 1.04-1.54) in women and prostate cancer (n = 6, meta-SIR = 1.06, CI: 1.01-1.12), compared to the general population.

The direction of risk was largely consistent across cohorts although we observed large between-cohort variations in SIR for cancers of the liver and lung in men and women, and stomach, colorectum, and skin in men.  Conclusion:   The results suggest that agricultural workers have a lower risk of various cancers and an elevated risk of prostate cancer, multiple myeloma (female), and melanoma of skin (female) compared to the general population.

We compared PNI detection efficiency between SBx and TBx through transperineal approach. We identified patients with PCa who underwent transperineal TBx and concomitant standard 20-core template SBx from September 2019 to February 2021. Clinical, MRI imaging and biopsy characteristics were evaluated and compared between TBx and SBx. Two hundred thirty-eight patients with PCa underwent concomitant transperineal SBx and TBx procedures. Combined PNI+ (SBxPNI+ and/or TBxPNI+) was identified in 77 of 238 (32.4%) patients. SBx detected 23.9% PNI-positive patients and TBx detected 19.3% PNI-positive patients of all patients with PCa. Patients with PNI were with significantly different clinicopathological characteristics than patients without PNI.

Conclusions:   Salvage RA-SVE appears to be a safe focal treatment, with very low morbidity, for patients with localised SV recurrence after LDR-PB. It permits deferral of androgen deprivation therapy in selected patients. Bilateral SVE is mandatory.

We sought to develop a method to prospectively quantify the financial implications, including risk and uncertainty of (1) transitioning from a fee-for-service to an episode-based payment model and (2) modifying episode-specific clinical cost drivers. Finally, we highlight practical applications for the model to help facilitate stakeholder engagement in the transition to value-based payment models.  Study design:   We created a financial simulation from empirical data to demonstrate the feasibility and potential use cases within the context of a hypothetical episode-based payment model for prostate cancer surgery (prostatectomy).  Methods:   We used Monte Carlo simulation methods to predict financial outcomes under various clinical and payment model scenarios for our pilot prostatectomy episode use case. We input patient-level empirical cost, reimbursement, and clinical data for a cohort of 157 patients at our institution into our model to quantify expected financial outcomes (payments, financial margins) and financial risk for stakeholders (payer, hospital, providers) under an episode-based payment model.  Results:   Compared with the status quo, there is a range of expected financial outcomes for various stakeholders depending on the financial parameters (episode price, shared savings, downside risk, stop-loss) in an episode-based payment model. Modifying clinical cost drivers has a profound impact on these outcomes. Uncertainty is high due to the small number of episodes.  Conclusions:   The simulation demonstrates that both financial parameters and clinical cost drivers significantly affect the expected financial outcomes for stakeholders in value-based payment models.""","""['David C Johnson', 'Fernanda Bravo', 'Eric Kwok', 'Christine Ahn', 'Artem Pashchinskiy', 'Mark S Litwin', 'Christopher S Saigal']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Manag Care""","""['Financial Margins for Prostate Cancer Surgery: Quantifying the Impact of Modifiable Cost Inputs in an Episode Based Reimbursement Model.', ""Medicare's Bundled Payment Initiatives for Hospital-Initiated Episodes: Evidence and Evolution."", 'Episode-Based Payment and Direct Employer Purchasing of Healthcare Services: Recent Bundled Payment Innovations and the Geisinger Health System Experience.', 'Episodic payments (bundling): PART I.', 'Shifting Away From Fee-For-Service: Alternative Approaches to Payment in Gastroenterology.', ""Physicians' views on optimal use and payment system for telemedicine: a qualitative study.""]"""

The primary outcome was the time to first adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular event (composite of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) through 12 months.

Exosomes derived from tumor cells possess biological significance and can mediate intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) is also implicated in the stability in tumorigenesis and the development of PCa, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Hence, the current study set out to investigate the physiological mechanisms by which exosomes-encapsulated NEAT1 affects the progression of PCa. First, after isolation, we found PCa cell-derived exosomes induced the osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs). Besides, NEAT1 in PCa cells could be transferred into hBMSCs via exosomes. Further gain- and loss-of-function experimentation revealed that NEAT1 acted as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of microRNA (miR)-205-5p to upregulate the runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) levels. Moreover, NEAT1 could promote the RUNX2 expression via the splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich (SFPQ)/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2) axis. Functional assays uncovered that NEAT1 shuttled by PCa-exosomes facilitated the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization of extracellular matrix, and continuously upregulated the levels of RUNX2, ALP, alpha-1 type 1 collagen, and osteocalcin by regulating RUNX2, to induce the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Furthermore, in vivo experimentation confirmed that upregulated NEAT1 induced osteogenesis. Collectively, our findings indicated that PCa-derived exosomes-loaded NEAT1 upregulated RUNX2 to facilitate the osteogenesis of hBMSCs by competitively binding to miR-205-5p via the SFPQ/PTBP2 axis, therefore providing a potential therapeutic target to treat osteogenesis of hBMSCs in PCa. PCa cells secrete exosomes containing NEAT1, and NEAT1 exerts effects on osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in PCa. NEAT1 shuttled by PCa-derived exosomes could be transferred into hBMSCs, where NEAT1 exerted inductive properties in osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs through the upregulation of RUNX2 by competitively binding to miR-205-5p and regulating SFPQ/PTBP2 in vitro and in vivo.""","""['Chengqiang Mo', 'Bin Huang', 'Jintao Zhuang', 'Shuangjian Jiang', 'Shengjie Guo', 'Xiaopeng Mao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Clin Transl Med""","""['Super-Enhancer-Associated Long Non-Coding RNA LINC01485 Promotes Osteogenic Differentiation of Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells by Regulating MiR-619-5p/RUNX2 Axis.', 'Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes attenuated prostate cancer progression via the miR-99b-5p/IGF1R axis.', 'LncRNA XIXT promotes osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells and alleviates osteoporosis progression by targeting miRNA-30a-5p.', 'NEAT1 as a competing endogenous RNA in tumorigenesis of various cancers: Role, mechanism and therapeutic potential.', 'The Role of Long Non-coding RNA, Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1) in Cancer and Other Pathologies.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'NEAT1/microRNA 339-5p/SPI1 Axis Feedback Loop Contributes to Osteogenic Differentiation in Acute Suppurative Osteomyelitis in Children.', 'The biological function of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles on metabolism.', 'FOXA1-induced LINC00621 promotes lung adenocarcinoma progression via activating the TGF-β signaling pathway.', 'Crosstalk between N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification and noncoding RNA in tumor microenvironment.']"""

However, the underlying mechanisms of NPRL2 dysregulation remain poorly understood. This study aimed to explore the transcription factors (TFs) contributing to NPRL2 dysregulation in prostate cancer. Potential TFs were identified using prostate tissue/cell-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq data collected in the Cistrome Data Browser and Signaling Pathways Project. Dual-luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR assay were conducted to assess the binding and activating effect of TFs on the gene promoter. Cell Counting Kit-8 and colony formation assays were performed to assess cell proliferation. Results showed that E2F1 is a TF that bound to the NPRL2 promoter and activated its transcription. NPRL2 inhibition significantly alleviated E2F1 enhanced cell proliferation. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that E2F1 upregulation was associated with unfavorable progression-free survival and disease-specific survival. FOXO1 interacted and E2F1 in both PC3 and LNCaP cells and weakened the binding of E2F1 to the NPRL2 promoter. Functionally, FOXO1 overexpression significantly slowed the proliferation of PC3 and LNCaP cells and also decreased E2F1 enhanced cell proliferation. In summary, this study revealed a novel FOXO1/E2F1-NPRL2 regulatory axis in prostate cancer. E2F1 binds to the NPRL2 promoter and activates its transcription, while FOXO1 interacts with E2F1 and weakens its transcriptional activating effects. These findings help expand our understanding of the prostate cancer etiology and suggest that the FOXO1/E2F1-NPRL2 signaling axis might be a potential target.""","""['Yu Tang', 'Li Jiang', 'Xin Zhao', 'Daixing Hu', 'Guozhi Zhao', 'Shengjun Luo', 'Xiaoyi Du', 'Wei Tang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['NPRL2 reduces the niraparib sensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer via interacting with UBE2M and enhancing neddylation.', 'NPRL2 promotes docetaxel chemoresistance in castration resistant prostate cancer cells by regulating autophagy through the mTOR pathway.', 'Targeting NPRL2 to enhance the efficacy of Olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Loss of FOXO1 Cooperates with TMPRSS2-ERG Overexpression to Promote Prostate Tumorigenesis and Cell Invasion.', 'The Essential Role of FoxO1 in the Regulation of Macrophage Function.', 'CDC25A inhibition suppresses cell proliferation and induces G1/S‑phase cell cycle arrest in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.', 'Recent findings on miR‑370 expression, regulation and functions in cancer (Review).', 'MTA2 is one of 14 Transcription factors predicting recurrence free survival in gastric cancer and promotes cancer progression by targeting MCM5.', 'Resveratrol alleviates Ang II-induced vascular smooth muscle cell senescence by upregulating E2F1/SOD2 axis.']"""

However, the landscape of their expression in human cells and functional aspects are still unknown. We found that longer palindromic sequences are a unique feature of SAS chimeras. Structural analysis indicates that a long hairpin-like structure formed by many consecutive Watson-Crick base pairs appears because of these long palindromic sequences, which possibly play a similar role as double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), interfering with gene expression. RNA-RNA interaction analysis suggested that SAS chimeras could significantly interact with their parental mRNAs, indicating their potential regulatory features. Here, 267 SAS chimeras were mapped in RNA-seq data from 16 healthy human tissues, revealing their expression in normal cells.

Numerous preclinical studies in different animal models of cancer have examined the effect of KDs on cancer growth, but no large randomized controlled studies or prospective cohort studies are available for human cancer patients. Evidence supporting the use of KDs as an adjunct to traditional cancer therapy has come predominantly from anecdotes and case reports. The first KD clinical trials in patients with glioblastoma revealed good acceptance and a possible anti-tumor effect. Metabolic therapy options such as the KD are not yet part of the standard of care in cancer patients. However, many cancer patients have begun implementing a KD or LC diet on their own. The aim of the present study was to gather information, via an online questionnaire, about how cancer patients go about implementing a KD or LC diet, what resources they rely on, whether they perceive benefits from the diet on quality of life (QoL), and what factors influence feasibility and adherence to the diet. Method: Recruitment of participants was carried out via social media platforms, forums and cooperating physicians (April 2018 through November 2018). To be eligible for the study, participants had to be diagnosed with cancer and on a KD or LC diet at the time of participating in the study or been on a KD or LC diet during cancer treatment. Study participants were asked to fill out an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four parts and contained a total of 64 questions. The questions were focused on the current health status of the participant, type of cancer, time since diagnosis, and treatment regimen. In addition, questions addressed social support, extent of professional counseling, food preferences and QoL. Results: A total of 96 participants (77 F, 17 M) submitted the questionnaire, of which 94 were included in the final data analysis. Ages ranged between 24 and 79 years (mean 50.1 ± 12.1 years). In 73.4% of the participants, the tumor had not formed metastases at the time of initial diagnosis. Twenty-four (26%) participants had a PET-positive tumor, 8 (9%) a PET-negative tumor, and the remainder (66.0%) did not report a PET scan. Eighty seven percent had undergone surgery in the course of their cancer treatment. The most frequent tumor type was breast cancer, followed by cervical cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Fifty nine percent of the study participants stated that they followed a KD during cancer therapy, 21% followed a low carbohydrate/high fat (LCHF) diet and 12% followed a low glycemic index (LOGI) diet. Sixty nine percent reported an improvement of QoL because of the diet. Almost half of the study participants sourced their initial information on KDs and LC diets from the internet. We found a significant correlation between weight loss upon implementation of a KD and the extent of overweight (p < 0.001). Weight loss in already lean participants was not reported. Overall, 67% of the participants found long-term adherence to the diet to be ""easy"" and 10.6% described it as being ""very easy."" Participants who like fatty foods tended to perceive the diet as being easier to follow (p = 0.063). Conclusion: The KD or LC diet improved self-reported QoL in more than two-thirds of study participants. The KD had a normalizing effect on body weight. The majority of the participants rated the diet as easy or very easy to follow long term. There was an obvious gap between patients' desire for professional dietary counseling and what is currently offered by health care providers.

Previously, novel androgen receptor axis-targeted agents (ARATs) were approved for metastatic castration-naïve and non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC); both of which are pivotal for investigating the association between the bone microenvironment and tumors. The present study established a novel in vitro 3D microenvironment model that simulated the bone microenvironment of CRPC, and evaluated the drug susceptibility of ARATs and the efficacy of the combination of abiraterone and dutasteride. Green fluorescent protein-transferred C4-2 cells (a CRPC cell line) and red fluorescent protein-transferred human osteoblasts differentiated from human mesenchymal stem cells were co-cultured in chitosan nanofiber matrix-coated culture plates to simulate the 3D scaffold of the bone microenvironment. The growth of C4-2 was quantified using live-cell imaging and the Cell3 iMager duos analysis system. The growth of C4-2 colonies were quantified for a maximum of 30 days. The expression of TGF-β increased and promoted EMT in C4-2 cells co-cultured with osteoblasts, indicating resistance to ARATs. The IC50 of each drug and the combination effect of abiraterone and dutasteride were evaluated using this model. Combination treatment with abiraterone and dutasteride synergistically inhibited the growth of C2-4 colonies compared with individual investigational agents. This could be attributed to the reduction of 3-keto-5α-abiraterone, an androgen receptor agonist.

Methods:   Using 2008-2018 cancer mortality data for the Italian population and for Italy-born Americans, we calculated age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs).  Results:   ASMRs were lower in Italy-born Americans (201.5 per 100 000) compared to Italians (255.1 per 100 000). For all neoplasms combined, SMRs for Italy-born American men and women were 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.77] and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.76-0.80), respectively. Among men, the SMRs were significantly below 1 for oral cavity, stomach, colorectal, liver, lung, prostate, bladder and kidney cancer. Among women, the SMRs were 0.69 for oral, 0.40 for stomach, 0.61 for colorectal, 0.72 for liver, 0.73 for breast and 0.53 for kidney cancers. Mortality was not reduced for lung (1.02, 95% CI, 0.94-1.10) cancer in women.  Conclusion:   Generational differences in smoking prevalence patterns between the US and Italy may explain the advantages for Italy-born Americans for lung and other tobacco-related cancers compared to their Italian men counterparts. Lower prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, alcohol consumption, hepatitis B and C virus in the USA may justify the lower mortality for stomach and liver cancer, among Italy-born Americans. Earlier and more widespread adoption of cancer screening and effective treatments in the USA is likely to be influential in breast, colorectal and prostate cancer mortality.""","""['Claudia Santucci', 'Heidy N Medina', 'Greta Carioli', 'Eva Negri', 'Carlo La Vecchia', 'Paulo S Pinheiro']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['Report on health status of residents in areas with industrial, mining or military sites in Sardinia, Italy.', 'Italian cancer burden by broad geographical area.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Using mortality and population figures from the WHO and Eurostat databases, we estimated the number of averted cancer deaths in the EU27 over the period 1989-2021, for both sexes, for all cancers, and nine major cancer sites. We also computed the avoided deaths for all cancers in five major European countries and the UK. We estimated a total of 4 958 000 (3 339 000 men and 1 619 000 women) avoided deaths for all neoplasms over the period 1989-2021 and 348 000 (246 000 men and 102 000 women) in 2021 alone in the EU27. For both sexes, we estimated 1 679 000 avoided deaths for stomach cancer, 747 000 for colorectum, 227 000 for bladder, 102 000 for leukemias. Avoided deaths for lung cancer accounted for 1 156 000 in men, while no reduction was estimated for women. For breast and uterine cancer, avoided deaths were about 300 000, for ovary 105 000 and for prostate 352 000. In the UK, a total of 1 061 000 (721 000 men and 340 000 women) deaths was avoided. Elimination of tobacco may avoid a further 20% of cancer mortality by 2050. Control of alcohol, overweight and obesity, and occupational and environmental carcinogens may avoid an additional 10% of cancer deaths. A similar reduction may be due to optimal adoption of cervical, colorectal, breast, and probably, lung and prostate cancer screening. Thus, primary and secondary cancer prevention can avoid an additional third of cancer deaths in Europe up to 2050.""","""['Carlo La Vecchia', 'Eva Negri', 'Greta Carioli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer Prev""","""['European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2023 with focus on lung cancer.', 'European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2021 with focus on pancreatic and female lung cancer.', 'European cancer mortality predictions for the year 2022 with focus on ovarian cancer.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: Estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers in 2018.', 'Attributable Fraction of Cancer Related to Occupational Exposure in Italy.', 'Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) and Microinvasive DCIS: Role of Surgery in Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer.', 'Application of CRISPR/Cas9 Technology in Cancer Treatment: A Future Direction.', 'Prevalence of Germline BRCA1/2 Variants in Ashkenazi and Non-Ashkenazi Prostate Cancer Populations: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

We report long-term control and toxicity outcomes and analyse the predictors of failure and toxicity.  Materials and methods:   The records of 120 consecutive high-risk prostate cancer patients treated in a single institution between February 2012 and December 2016 were retrospectively analysed. A moderately hypofractionted radiotherapy (HypoRT) regimen of 60 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks with simultaneous elective pelvic irradiation to 44 Gy in 20 fractions with intensity-modulated radiotherapy was used, together with long-term ADT with either orchiectomy or medical castration for a total duration of 2-3 years. We analysed biochemical control, metastasis-free survival and late toxicities and their predictive factors using survival analysis.  Results:   Patients had locally advanced cancers (cT3 77.5%, median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen 30 ng/ml, Gleason score 8-10 in 45.8%). The median follow-up time was 70 months. The 3- and 5-year probability of freedom from biochemical progression was 93% and 80%, respectively. The 5-year probability of freedom from local relapse/intra-pelvic nodal relapse/distant metastases as the site of first failure was 96%/97%/86%, respectively. Gleason score 8-10 and medical ADT for 2-3 years (as opposed to orchidectomy) were independent risk factors for distant metastases. A total of 18 grade 2 and above late gastrointestinal toxicity events and a total of 23 grade 2 and above late genitourinary toxicity events were documented. Patients who underwent a transurethral resection of prostate prior to radiotherapy had worse urological toxicity.  Conclusions:   HypoRT with elective nodal treatment results in excellent pelvic control. Distant metastases are the primary mode of failure. Risk of metastases is associated with Gleason score and the duration of ADT.

Aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been found to be related to the progression of various diseases. LncRNA prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) has been demonstrated to be involved in the initiation and progression of human cancers. However, to date, the clinical and functional significance of PCGEM1 expression in NSCLC progression remains unknown.  Methods:   The expression of LncRNA PCGEM1 and miR-152-3p in NSCLC tissues and cells was analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Experiments using NSCLC cells were conducted to explore the influence of PCGEM1 on tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion.  Results:   Increased expression of PCGEM1 was observed in NSCLC tissues and cells compared with the corresponding controls (all P < 0.001). PCGEM1 expression was associated with NSCLC patients' lymph node metastasis and TNM stage (all P < 0.05), and the knockdown of PCGEM1 in NSCLC cells led to inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The further luciferase reporter assay and expression results showed that miR-152-3p might be a target gene of PCGEM1 and mediate the effects of PCGEM1 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in NSCLC.  Conclusion:   Thus, the findings from the present study indicate that the NSCLC patients have significantly increased PCGEM1 and decreased miR-152-3p expression and that the knockdown of PCGEM1 may inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion by sponging miR-152-3p.

The two most common genetic alterations in PCa are expression of the TMPRSS2/ERG (TE) fusion gene and loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor. These genetic alterations act cooperatively to transform prostatic epithelium but the exact mechanisms involved are unclear.  Methods:   Microarray expression analysis of immortalized prostate epithelial cells transformed by loss of PTEN and expression of the TE fusion revealed MEX3D as one of the most highly upregulated genes. MEX3D expression in prostate cancer was examined in patient samples and in silico. In vitro and in vivo studies to characterize the biological impact of MEX3D were carried out. Analysis of the TCGA PanCancer database revealed TCF3 as a major target of MEX3D. The induction of TCF3 by MEX3D was confirmed and the biological impact of TCF3 examined by in vitro studies.  Results:   MEX3D is expressed at increased levels in prostate cancer and is increased by decreased PTEN and/or expression of the TE fusion gene and drives soft agar colony formation, invasion and tumor formation in vivo. The known oncogenic transcription factor TCF3 is highly correlated with MEX3D in prostate cancer. MEX3D expression strongly induces TCF3, which promotes soft agar colony formation and invasion in vitro.

We report local recurrence (LR), widespread progression (WSP), and overall survival (OS) for oligometastatic patients treated to bone lesions with SBRT and investigate the hypothesis that outcomes are different between patients with spine and non-spine bone oligometastatic disease.  Methods:   Patients with oligometastatic disease (≤5 cumulative extracranial metastases) treated with bone SBRT at 6 international institutions from 2007 to 2016 were reviewed. Fine and Gray competing risks and Cox regressions were used to analyze univariable and multivariable relationships between disease/treatment factors and outcomes.  Results:   In total, 288 spine and 233 NSB lesions are reported in 356 patients. Cumulative incidence of LR across all bone lesions was 6.3%, 12.6% and 19.3% at 6 mo, 1 yr and 2 yrs. While univariable analysis suggested inferior LC and OS in spine patients, this did not hold true in multivariable analysis. The final regression model for LR in NSB lesions included PTV ≥ median of 31.8 cc (HR 5.02, p = 0.014) and primary histology, with RCC and NSCLC conferring a 10.8- and 6.5-fold increased risk of LR compared to prostate histology, respectively. The spine LR model included radioresistant histology (HR 2.11, p = 0.0051), PTV Dmin (BED10) ≥ median of 19.1 Gy (HR 0.46, p = 0.0085), and epidural disease (HR 1.99, p = 0.016).  Conclusion:   This large multi-institutional series reports comparably excellent response to SBRT for a balanced distribution of oligometastatic NSB and spine lesions.

Longitudinal studies, coupled with the use of liquid biopsies, offer a potentially new and minimally invasive platform to study the dynamics of tumour progression. Our aim was to investigate the dynamics of personal DNA methylomic profiles of metastatic PCa (mPCa) patients, during disease progression and therapy administration.  Results:   Forty-eight plasma samples from 9 mPCa patients were collected, longitudinally, over 13-21 months. After circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) isolation, DNA methylation was profiled using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip. The top 5% most variable probes across time, within each individual, were utilised to study dynamic methylation patterns during disease progression and therapeutic response. Statistical testing was carried out to identify differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in cfDNA, which were subsequently validated in two independent mPCa (cfDNA and FFPE tissue) cohorts. Individual cfDNA global methylation patterns were temporally stable throughout the disease course. However, a proportion of CpG sites presented a dynamic temporal pattern that was consistent with clinical events, including different therapies, and were prominently associated with genes linked to immune response pathways. Additionally, study of the tumour fraction of cfDNA identified > 2000 DMGs with dynamic methylation patterns.

Here, we report the synthesis of an optimized 68Ga-labeled ODAP-Urea-based ligand, [68Ga]Ga-P137, and first-in-human results.  Methods:   Twelve ODAP-Urea-based ligands were synthesized and radiolabeled with 68Ga in high radiochemical yield and purity. Their PSMA inhibitory capacities were determined using the NAALADase assay. Radioligands were evaluated in mice-bearing 22Rv1 prostate tumors by microPET. Lead compound [68Ga]Ga-P137 was evaluated for stability, cell uptake, and biodistribution. PET imaging of [68Ga]Ga-P137 was performed in three patients head-to-head compared to [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617.  Results:   Ligands were synthesized in 11.1-44.4% yield and > 95% purity. They have high affinity to PSMA (Ki of 0.13 to 5.47 nM). [68Ga]Ga-P137 was stable and hydrophilic. [68Ga]Ga-P137 showed higher uptake than [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 in tumor-bearing mice at 6.43 ± 0.98%IA/g vs 3.41 ± 1.31%IA/g at 60-min post-injection.

We looked at associations with 14 types of cancer, previously suggested to be associated with obesity.  Results:   All genetic instruments had a strong association with BMI (p < 1 × 10-300 for all). The instrument reflecting unfavourable adiposity was also associated with higher CRP, HbA1c and adverse lipid profile, while instrument reflecting metabolically favourable adiposity was associated with lower HbA1c and a favourable lipid profile. In MR-inverse-variance weighted analysis unfavourable adiposity was associated with an increased risk of non-hormonal cancers (OR = 1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.08, 1.38), but a lower risk of hormonal cancers (OR = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.72, 0.89). From individual cancers, MR analyses suggested causal increases in the risk of multiple myeloma (OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.09, 1.70) and endometrial cancer (OR = 1.77, 95%CI: 1.16, 2.68) by greater genetically instrumented unfavourable adiposity but lower risks of breast and prostate cancer (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.61, 0.83 and OR = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.68, 0.97, respectively). Favourable or neutral adiposity were not associated with the odds of any individual cancer.  Conclusions:   Higher adiposity associated with a higher risk of non-hormonal cancer but a lower risk of some hormone related cancers. Presence of metabolic abnormalities might aggravate the adverse effects of higher adiposity on cancer. Further studies are warranted to investigate whether interventions on adverse metabolic health may help to alleviate obesity-related cancer risk.""","""['Muktar Ahmed', 'Anwar Mulugeta', 'S Hong Lee', 'Ville-Petteri Mäkinen', 'Terry Boyle', 'Elina Hyppönen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Obes (Lond)""","""['Disease consequences of higher adiposity uncoupled from its adverse metabolic effects using Mendelian randomisation.', 'Body size and composition and risk of site-specific cancers in the UK Biobank and large international consortia: A mendelian randomisation study.', 'Higher adiposity and mental health: causal inference using Mendelian randomization.', 'Association Between Metabolically Different Adiposity Subtypes and Osteoarthritis: A Mendelian Randomization Study.', 'Genetic predisposition to metabolically unfavourable adiposity and prostate cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization analysis.', 'Estimating Burden of Mortality due to Excess Body Mass Index in the US Adult Population by Combining Evidence from a Mendelian Randomization Study and National Health Surveys.', 'Using machine learning to identify gene interaction networks associated with breast cancer.', 'The timing of adiposity and changes in the life course on the risk of cancer.', 'Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies on Endometrial Cancer.', 'Metabolic Disorders in Multiple Myeloma.']"""

We hypothesized that combining sip-T with interleukin (IL)-7, a homeostatic cytokine that enhances both B and T cell development and proliferation, would augment and prolong antigen-specific immune responses against both PA2024 (the immunogen for sip-T) and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP).  Methods:   Fifty-four patients with mCRPC treated with sip-T were subsequently enrolled and randomized 1:1 into observation (n=26) or IL-7 (n=28) arms of a phase II clinical trial (NCT01881867). Recombinant human (rh) IL-7 (CYT107) was given weekly×4. Immune responses were evaluated using flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), interferon (IFN)-γ ELISpot, 3H-thymidine incorporation, and ELISA.  Results:   Treatment with rhIL-7 was well tolerated. For the rhIL-7-treated, but not observation group, statistically significant lymphocyte subset expansion was found, with 2.3-2.6-fold increases in CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD56bright NK cells at week 6 compared with baseline. No significant differences in PA2024 or PAP-specific T cell responses measured by IFN-γ ELISpot assay were found between rhIL-7 and observation groups. However, antigen-specific T cell proliferative responses and humoral IgG and IgG/IgM responses significantly increased over time in the rhIL-7-treated group only. CyTOF analyses revealed pleiotropic effects of rhIL-7 on lymphocyte subsets, including increases in CD137 and intracellular IL-2 and IFN-γ expression. While not powered to detect clinical outcomes, we found that 31% of patients in the rhIL-7 group had prostate specific antigen (PSA) doubling times of >6 months, compared with 14% in the observation group.  Conclusions:   Treatment with rhIL-7 led to a significant expansion of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and CD56bright natural killer (NK) cells compared with observation after treatment with sip-T. The rhIL-7 treatment also led to improved antigen-specific humoral and T cell proliferative responses over time as well as to increased expression of activation markers and beneficial cytokines. This is the first study to evaluate the use of rhIL-7 after sip-T in patients with mCRPC and demonstrates encouraging results for combination approaches to augment beneficial immune responses.""","""['Russell K Pachynski#', 'Chihiro Morishima#', 'Russell Szmulewitz', 'Lauren Harshman', 'Leonard Appleman', 'Paul Monk', 'Rhonda L Bitting', 'Omer Kucuk', 'Frederick Millard', 'John D Seigne', 'Steven P Fling', 'Holden T Maecker', 'Caroline Duault', 'Nirasha Ramchurren', 'Bruce Hess', ""Leonard D'Amico"", 'Andreanne Lacroix', 'Judith C Kaiser', 'Michel Morre', 'Anne Grégoire', 'Martin Cheever', 'Evan Y Yu', 'Lawrence Fong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Antigen-Specific CD8 Lytic Phenotype Induced by Sipuleucel-T in Hormone-Sensitive or Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer and Association with Overall Survival.', 'Pre-existing immune status associated with response to combination of sipuleucel-T and ipilimumab in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A Randomized Phase II Trial of Sipuleucel-T with Concurrent versus Sequential Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy with Sipuleucel-T: Current Standards and Future Directions.', 'Optimal timing of sipuleucel-T treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Vaccinating against cancer: getting to prime time.', 'Establishing a Proteomics-Based Signature of AKR1C3-Related Genes for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Vaccines as treatments for prostate cancer.', 'Step-dose IL-7 treatment promotes systemic expansion of T\xa0cells and alters immune cell landscape in blood and lymph nodes.', 'The Role of Interleukin-7 in the Formation of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures and Their Prognostic Value in Gastrointestinal Cancers.']"""

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that detect and kill transformed cells without prior sensitization, and their infiltration into prostate tumors corresponds with an increased overall survival among patients with mCRPC. We sought to harness this knowledge to develop an approach to NK-cell based immunotherapy for mCRPC. We engineered an NK cell line (NK-92MI) to express CD64, the sole human high-affinity IgG Fcγ receptor (FcγR1), and bound these cells with antibodies to provide interchangeable tumor-targeting elements. NK-92MICD64 cells were evaluated for cell-activation mechanisms and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). A combination of mAbs was used to target the prostate tumor antigen tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 (TROP2) and the cancer-associated fibroblast marker fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP). We found that CD64, which is normally expressed by myeloid cells and associates with the adaptor molecule FcRγ, can be expressed by NK-92MI cells and mediate ADCC through an association with CD3ζ. Cytotoxicity from the combination approach was two-fold higher compared to treatment with NK-92MICD64 cells and either mAb alone, and seven-fold higher than NK-92MICD64 cells alone at an effector-target cell ratio of 20:1. The cytotoxic effect was lost when using isotype control antibodies, indicating a selective targeting mechanism. The combination approach demonstrated efficacy in vivo as well and significantly reduced tumor growth compared with the saline control. This combination therapy presents a potential approach for treating mCRPC and could improve immunotherapy response.""","""['Hallie M Hintz#', 'Kristin M Snyder#', 'Jianming Wu', 'Robert Hullsiek', 'James D Dahlvang', 'Geoffrey T Hart', 'Bruce Walcheck', 'Aaron M LeBeau']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Res""","""['Examination of IgG Fc Receptor CD16A and CD64 Expression by Canine Leukocytes and Their ADCC Activity in Engineered NK Cells.', 'Expression of a Recombinant High Affinity IgG Fc Receptor by Engineered NK Cells as a Docking Platform for Therapeutic mAbs to Target Cancer Cells.', 'Gene-modified NK-92MI cells expressing a chimeric CD16-BB-ζ or CD64-BB-ζ receptor exhibit enhanced cancer-killing ability in combination with therapeutic antibody.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Natural killer (NK) cells and anti-tumor therapeutic mAb: unexplored interactions.', 'Ablation of SYK Kinase from Expanded Primary Human NK Cells via CRISPR/Cas9 Enhances Cytotoxicity and Cytokine Production.', 'Natural Killer Cells: A Promising Kit in the Adoptive Cell Therapy Toolbox.', 'Examination of IgG Fc Receptor CD16A and CD64 Expression by Canine Leukocytes and Their ADCC Activity in Engineered NK Cells.', 'A Hot Topic: Cancer Immunotherapy and Natural Killer Cells.', 'Expression of Fibroblast Activation Protein Is Enriched in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer and Predicts Worse Survival.']"""

Patientsand methods:   In this retrospective analysis, we analyzed 63 patients who underwent ctDNA genomic profiling during their mCRPC disease course using a CLIA-certified commercial assay. The primary objective was to assess the feasibility of commercial ctDNA analysis in a real world mCRPC cohort. Key secondary objectives included assessment of the landscape of pathogenic ctDNA alterations and the prognostic significance of ctDNA detection on overall survival (OS).  Results:   Among the cohort, at the time of ctDNA collection, median age was 70 years, and 47.6% (N = 30/63) had bone-only metastases. ctDNA was detected in the majority of patients with at least 1 pathogenic alteration detected in 90.5% (N = 57/63) of individuals. The most common alterations detected were in AR, TP53, and PIK3CA. Actionable alterations with FDA-approved therapies were found in 15.8% (N = 10) of the cohort. The presence of ≤ 1 versus > 1 alteration on ctDNA analysis was strongly associated with inferior OS with a median OS of 26.1 versus 8.8 months, respectively (HR = 7.0, 95% CI, 2.2-23.1, P < .001). In multivariate analysis, the number of detected alterations remained a significant predictor for OS. Lastly, there was weak correlation between Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA), and ctDNA characteristics.  Conclusion:   ctDNA is a viable next generation sequencing (NGS) platform in mCRPC and can be utilized to identify actionable alterations.

During the ""male programming window"" the fetal testes start to produce testosterone that initiates the development of the male reproductive tract. Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) able to mimic or disrupt steroid hormone actions may disrupt testicular development and adversely impact reproductive health at birth, during puberty and adulthood. The testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) occurs as a result inhibition of androgen action on fetal development preceding Sertoli and Leydig cell dysfunction and may result from direct or epigenetic effects. Hypospadias, cryptorchidism and poor semen quality are elements of TDS, which may be considered a risk factor for testicular germ cell cancer (TGCC). Exposure to estrogen or estrogenic EDCs results in developmental estrogenization/estrogen imprinting in the rodent for prostate cancer (PCa). This can disrupt prostate histology by disorganization of the epithelium, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions, in particular high-grade PIN (HGPIN) lesions which are precursors of prostatic adenocarcinoma. These defects persist throughout the lifespan of the animal and later in life estrogen exposure predispose development of cancer. Exposure of pregnant dams to vinclozolin, a competitive anti-androgen, and results in prominent, focal regions of inflammation in all exposed animals. The inflammation closely resembles human nonbacterial prostatitis that occurs in young men and evidence indicates that inflammation plays a central role in the development of PCa. In conclusion, in utero exposure to endocrine disrupters may predispose to the development of TDS, testicular cancer (TCa) and PCa and are illustrations of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD).""","""['M S Bornman', 'N H Aneck-Hahn']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Adv Pharmacol""","""['Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals and Reproductive Health in Boys and Men.', 'Regional differences and temporal trends in male reproductive health disorders: semen quality may be a sensitive marker of environmental exposures.', 'Temporal decline of sperm concentration: role of endocrine disruptors.', 'Is testicular dysgenesis syndrome a genetic, endocrine, or environmental disease, or an unexplained reproductive disorder?', 'Cryptorchidism and hypospadias as a sign of testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS): environmental connection.', 'Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals and Disease Endpoints.', 'Environmental disruptors and testicular cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate how hypoxia affects the choline radiotracer dynamics. Three underlying mechanisms by which hypoxia could potentially alter the uptake of the choline radiotracer, [18F]-D4-FCH, were investigated: 18F-D4-FCH import, CHKA phosphorylation activity, and the efflux of [18F]-D4-FCH and its phosphorylated product [18F]-D4-FCHP. The effects of hypoxia on [18F]-D4-FCH uptake were studied in CHKA-overexpressing cell lines of prostate cancer, PC-3, and breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The mechanisms of radiotracer efflux were assessed by the cell uptake and immunofluorescence in vitro and examined in vivo (n = 24). The mathematical modelling methodology was further developed to verify the efflux hypothesis using [18F]-D4-FCH dynamic PET scans from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (n = 17). We report a novel finding involving the export of phosphorylated [18F]-D4-FCH and [18F]-D4-FCHP via HIF-1α-responsive efflux transporters, including ABCB4, when the HIF-1α level is augmented. This is supported by a graphical analysis of human data with a compartmental model (M2T6k + k5) that accounts for the efflux.

When we directly apply the raw data for classification or clustering purposes, sometimes we observe that the learning algorithms do not perform well. One possible reason for this is the presence of redundant, noisy, and non-informative features or attributes in the datasets. Hence, feature selection methods are used to identify the subset of relevant features that can maximize the model performance. Moreover, due to reduction in feature dimension, both training time and storage required by the model can be reduced as well. In this paper, we present a tri-stage wrapper-filter-based feature selection framework for the purpose of medical report-based disease detection. In the first stage, an ensemble was formed by four filter methods-Mutual Information, ReliefF, Chi Square, and Xvariance-and then each feature from the union set was assessed by three classification algorithms-support vector machine, naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbors-and an average accuracy was calculated. The features with higher accuracy were selected to obtain a preliminary subset of optimal features. In the second stage, Pearson correlation was used to discard highly correlated features. In these two stages, XGBoost classification algorithm was applied to obtain the most contributing features that, in turn, provide the best optimal subset. Then, in the final stage, we fed the obtained feature subset to a meta-heuristic algorithm, called whale optimization algorithm, in order to further reduce the feature set and to achieve higher accuracy. We evaluated the proposed feature selection framework on four publicly available disease datasets taken from the UCI machine learning repository, namely, arrhythmia, leukemia, DLBCL, and prostate cancer. Our obtained results confirm that the proposed method can perform better than many state-of-the-art methods and can detect important features as well. Less features ensure less medical tests for correct diagnosis, thus saving both time and cost.""","""['Moumita Mandal', 'Pawan Kumar Singh', 'Muhammad Fazal Ijaz', 'Jana Shafi', 'Ram Sarkar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['R-HEFS: Rough set based heterogeneous ensemble feature selection method for medical data classification.', 'Upper-Limb Motion Recognition Based on Hybrid Feature Selection: Algorithm Development and Validation.', 'R-Ensembler: A greedy rough set based ensemble attribute selection algorithm with kNN imputation for classification of medical data.', 'Biomedical Image Classification in a Big Data Architecture Using Machine Learning Algorithms.', 'Multiclass feature selection with metaheuristic optimization algorithms: a review.', 'CRV-NET: Robust Intensity Recognition of Coronavirus in Lung Computerized Tomography Scan Images.', 'Feature selection for high dimensional microarray gene expression data via weighted signal to noise ratio.', 'Hybrid Techniques for the Diagnosis of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Based on Fusion of CNN Features.', 'Performance analysis of multiple input single layer neural network hardware chip.', 'Effective hybrid feature selection using different bootstrap enhances cancers classification performance.']"""
