This study was performed to determine whether the short-term ADT continued to improve OS, DSM, BF, and freedom from DM with longer follow-up.  Methods and materials:   From 1994 to 2001, NRG/RTOG 9408 randomized 2028 men from 212 North American institutions with T1b-T2b, N0 prostate adenocarcinoma and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤20ng/mL to RT alone or RT plus short-term ADT. Patients were stratified by PSA, tumor grade, and surgical versus clinical nodal staging. ADT was flutamide with either goserelin or leuprolide for 4 months. Prostate RT (66.6 Gy) was started after 2 months. OS was calculated at the date of death from any cause or at last follow-up. Secondary endpoints were DSM, BF, local progression, and DM. Acute and late toxic effects were assessed using RTOG toxicity scales.  Results:   Median follow-up in surviving patients was 14.8 years (range, 0.16-21.98). The 10-year and 18-year OS was 56% and 23%, respectively, with RT alone versus 63% and 23% with combined therapy (HR 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.05; P = .94). The hazards were not proportional (P = .003). Estimated restricted mean survival time at 18 years was 11.8 years (95% CI, 11.4-12.1) with combined therapy versus 11.3 years with RT alone (95% CI, 10.9-11.6; P = .05). The 10-year and 18-year DSM was 7% and 14%, respectively, with RT alone versus 3% and 8% with combined therapy (HR 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.75; P < .01). DM and BF favored combined therapy at 18 years. Rates of late grade ≥3 hepatic, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary toxicity were ≤1%, 3%, and 8%, respectively, with combined therapy versus ≤1%, 2%, and 5% with RT alone.  Conclusions:   Further follow-up demonstrates that OS converges at approximately 15 years, by which point the administration of 4 months of ADT had conferred an estimated additional 6 months of life.""","""['Christopher U Jones', 'Stephanie L Pugh', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Michael P Chetner', 'Mahul B Amin', 'Deborah W Bruner', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'Robert B Den', 'Mark H Leibenhaut', 'John M Longo', 'Jean-Paul Bahary', 'Seth A Rosenthal', 'Luis Souhami', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Alan C Hartford', 'Pradip P Amin', 'Mack Roach rd', 'Don Yee', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Joseph P Rodgers', 'Felix Y Feng', 'William U Shipley']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Erratum to: Jones, CU; Pugh, SL; Sandler, HM; Chetner, MP; Amin, MB; Bruner, DW; Zietman, AL; Den, RB; Leibenhaut, MH; Longo, JM; Bahary, JP; Rosenthal, SA; Souhami, L; Michalski, JM; Hartford, AC; Amin, PP; Roach, M 3rd; Yee, D; Efstathiou, JA; Rodgers, JP; Feng, FY; Shipley, WU.

The lack of proper catheter placement guidance during the procedure has left the physicians to rely on a heuristic thinking-while-doing technique, which may cause large catheter placement variation and increased plan quality uncertainty. Therefore, the achievable dose distribution could not be quantified prior to the catheter placement. To overcome this challenge, we proposed a learning-based method to provide HDR catheter placement guidance for prostate cancer patients undergoing HDR brachytherapy.  Methods:   The proposed framework consists of deformable registration via registration network (Reg-Net), multi-atlas ranking, and catheter regression. To model the global spatial relationship among multiple organs, binary masks of the prostate and organs-at-risk are transformed into distance maps, which describe the distance of each local voxel to the organ surfaces. For a new patient, the generated distance map is used as fixed image. Reg-Net is utilized to deformably register the distance maps from multi-atlas set to match this patient's distance map and then bring catheter maps from multi-atlas to this patient via spatial transformation. Several criteria, namely prostate volume similarity, multi-organ semantic image similarity, and catheter position criteria (far from the urethra and within the partial prostate), are used for multi-atlas ranking. The top-ranked atlas' deformed catheter positions are selected as the predicted catheter positions for this patient. Finally, catheter regression is used to refine the final catheter positions. A retrospective study on 90 patients with a fivefold cross-validation scheme was used to evaluate the proposed method's feasibility. In order to investigate the impact of plan quality from the predicted catheter pattern, we optimized the source dwell position and time for both the clinical catheter pattern and predicted catheter pattern with the same optimization settings. Comparisons of clinically relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were completed.  Results:   For all patients, on average, both the clinical plan dose and predicted plan dose meet the common dose constraints when prostate dose coverage is kept at V100 = 95%. The plans from the predicted catheter pattern have slightly higher hotspot in terms of V150 by 5.0% and V200 by 2.9% on average. For bladder V75, rectum V75, and urethra V125, the average difference is close to zero, and the range of most patients is within ±1 cc.  Conclusion:   We developed a new catheter placement prediction method for HDR prostate brachytherapy based on a deep-learning-based multi-atlas registration algorithm. It has great clinical potential since it can provide catheter location estimation prior to catheter placement, which could reduce the dependence on physicians' experience in catheter implantation and improve the quality of prostate HDR treatment plans. This approach merits further clinical evaluation and validation as a method of quality control for HDR prostate brachytherapy.""","""['Yang Lei', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Yabo Fu', 'Justin Roper', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Tian Liu', 'Pretesh Patel', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A novel urethral sparing technique for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy after transurethral resection of the prostate.', 'Simultaneous needle catheter selection and dwell time optimization for preplanning of high-dose-rate brachytherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'Artificial intelligence applications in brachytherapy: A literature review.']"""

Our objective was to identify provider- and patient-level characteristics associated with OAA initiation and adherence among individuals with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).  Methods:   We used state cancer registry data linked to multi-payer claims data to identify patients with mRCC diagnosed in 2004-2015. Provider data were obtained from North Carolina Health Professions Data System and the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System. We estimated risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence limits (CLs) using modified Poisson regression to evaluate factors associated with OAA initiation and adherence.  Results:   Among the 207 (out of 687) patients who initiated an OAA following mRCC diagnosis and survived 90 days, median proportion of days covered was 0.91. Patients with a modal provider specializing in hematology/medical oncology were much more likely to initiate OAAs than those seen by other specialties. Additionally, patients with a female provider were more likely to initiate OAAs than those with a male provider. Compared to patients treated by providers practicing in both urban and rural areas, patients with providers practicing solely in urban areas were more likely to initiate OAAs, after controlling for patient-level factors (RR = 1.37; 95% CL: 1.09-1.73). Medicare patients were less likely to be adherent than those with private insurance (RR = 0.61; 95% CL: 0.42-0.87).

Methods:   We relied on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, from 2004 to 2016. Kaplan-Meier plots and multivariable Cox regression models predicting cancer-specific mortality were used.  Results:   Of 584 upper tract urothelial carcinoma patients, 173 (29.6%) were Chinese versus 130 (22.3%) Japanese versus 68 (11.6%) Korean versus 64 (11.0%) Filipino versus 40 (6.8%) Vietnamese versus 109 (18.7%) other. Vietnamese and Chinese patients showed the highest rates of T4 N0 M0 and/or T1-4 N1-2 M0 (25.0% and 18.5%, respectively), relative to other Asian ethnic subgroups. In Kaplan-Meier plots, Vietnamese patients showed the highest cancer-specific mortality rate. In multivariable models, Vietnamese ethnicity also independently predicted higher cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio 2.15, P = 0.02 and hazard ratio 1.96, P = 0.03), relative to Japanese and Chinese patients. All other Asian ethnic subgroups showed similar cancer-specific mortality patterns.  Conclusion:   Vietnamese and Chinese patients are at a stage disadvantage at upper tract urothelial carcinoma diagnosis, relative to all other Asian ethnicities. After adjustment for stage, only Vietnamese patients showed a survival disadvantage relative to all other Asian ethnic subgroups. As a result, it appears that Vietnamese patients not only present at a higher upper tract urothelial carcinoma stage, but additionally appear to harbor upper tract urothelial carcinoma that progresses at a faster rate than in other Asian ethnic subgroups.""","""['Claudia Collà Ruvolo', 'Christoph Würnschimmel', 'Luigi Nocera', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Zhe Tian', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Fred Saad', 'Paolo Verze', 'Ciro Imbimbo', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Vincenzo Mirone', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment from Dr Shiota to Stage and cancer-specific mortality differ within specific Asian ethnic groups for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: North American population-based study.', 'Editorial Comment from Dr Lonati and Dr Moschini to Stage and cancer-specific mortality differ within specific Asian ethnic groups in upper tract urothelial carcinoma: North American population-based study.', 'Survival after nephroureterectomy for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: a population-based competing-risks analysis.', 'Incidence and Survival Rates of Contemporary Patients with Invasive Upper Tract Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Editorial Comment from Dr Shiota to Stage and cancer-specific mortality differ within specific Asian ethnic groups for upper tract urothelial carcinoma: North American population-based study.', 'Urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and the upper tract: disparate twins.', 'Role of lymphadenectomy in the management of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder and the upper urinary tract.', 'Racial/ethnic disparities in the distribution and effect of type and number of high-risk criteria on mortality in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy.']"""

Here, we present results from a single-center study to evaluate the utility of [18F]fluciclovine PET/CT to localize prostate cancer recurrence in patients with PSA <1 ng/mL.  Procedures:   Data from men who underwent [18F]fluciclovine PET/CT (August 2016-March 2020) for suspected recurrent prostate cancer and who had a PSA value <1ng/mL were retrospectively reviewed. The number of positive scans (positivity rates, PR) was calculated for the whole body, prostate/bed, and extraprostatic regions (pelvic or extrapelvic lymph nodes, bones, and soft tissue). PR were stratified by pre-scan PSA.  Results:   Data from 113 patients were included. In total, 98 (87%) were post-prostatectomy and 15 (13%) had received non-surgical primary therapy. Twenty patients (18%) were receiving ADT at the time of the scan, 91 (81%) were not, and ADT status was not known for 2 (1.8%) patients. The overall PR at PSA <1ng/mL was 59% (67/113). For the prostate/bed, it was 35% (40/113), and for extraprostatic locations, it was 37% (42/113). At PSA >0-<0.2, 0.2-<0.5, and 0.5-<1 ng/mL, the overall PR was 43% (10/23), 70% (35/50), and 55% (22/40), respectively. In the prostate/bed, these were 13% (3/23), 50% (25/50), and 30% (12/40), respectively, and in extraprostatic lesions were 30% (7/23), 44% (22/50), and 33% (13/40), respectively. Pelvic lymph nodes were the most common site for extraprostatic lesions (29/113, 26%). PR in extrapelvic lymph nodes, bone, and soft tissue were 8.0%, 12%, and 3.5%, respectively. Soft tissue lesions comprised lung nodules (n=3) and a perirectal mass implant (n=1).

The aim of this study was to evaluate if the prostate target biopsy (TB) outcomes could be predicted by using artificial intelligence approach based on a set of clinical pre-biopsy.  Methods:   Pre-biopsy characteristics in terms of PSA, PSA density, digital rectal examination (DRE), previous prostate biopsies, number of suspicious lesions at mp-MRI, lesion volume, lesion location, and Pi-Rads score were extracted from our prospectively maintained TB database from March 2014 to December 2019. Our approach is based on Fuzzy logic and associative rules mining, with the aim to predict TB outcomes.  Results:   A total of 1448 patients were included. Using the Frequent-Pattern growth algorithm we extracted 875 rules and used to build the fuzzy classifier. 963 subjects were classified whereas for the remaining 484 subjects were not classified since no rules matched with their input variables. Analyzing the classified subjects we obtained a specificity of 59.2% and sensitivity of 90.8% with a negative and the positive predictive values of 81.3% and 76.6%, respectively. In particular, focusing on ISUP ≥ 3 PCa, our model is able to correctly predict the biopsy outcomes in 98.1% of the cases.

The functional and clinical implications of different polymerase variants remain unclear.  Methods:   Targeted next-generation sequencing using a 425-cancer gene panel, which covers all exonic regions of three polymerase genes (POLE, POLD1, and POLH), was conducted in a cohort of 12,266 patients across 16 different tumor types from January 2017 to January 2019. Prognostication of POL variant-positive patients was performed using a cohort of 4679 patients from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets.  Results:   The overall prevalence of somatic and germline polymerase variants was 4.2% (95% CI 3.8% to 4.5%) and 0.7% (95% CI 0.5% to 0.8%), respectively, with highest frequencies in endometrial, urinary, prostate, and colorectal cancers (CRCs). While most germline polymerase variants showed no clear functional consequences, we identified a candidate p.T466A affecting the exonuclease domain of POLE, which might be underlying the early onset in a case with childhood CRC. Low frequencies of known hot-spot somatic mutations in POLE were detected and were associated with younger age, the male sex, and microsatellite stability. In both the panel and TCGA cohorts, POLE drivers exhibited high frequencies of alterations in genes in the DNA damage and repair (DDR) pathways, including BRCA2, ATM, MSH6, and ATR. Variants of unknown significance (VUS) of different polymerase domains showed variable penetrance with those in the exonuclease domain of POLE and POLD1 displaying high TMB. VUS in POL genes exhibited an additive effect as carriers of multiple VUS had exponentially increased TMB and prolonged overall survival. Similar to cases with driver mutations, the TMB-high POL VUS samples showed DDR pathway involvement and polymerase hypermutation signatures. Combinatorial analysis of POL and DDR pathway status further supported the potential additive effects of POL VUS and DDR pathway genes and revealed distinct prognostic subclasses that were independent of cancer type and TMB.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   HRQoL was assessed using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-3L questionnaires at day 1 of cycle 1 (predose/baseline), cycles 2-6, every two cycles during cycles 7-13, every four cycles thereafter, at the end of treatment, and every 4 mo after progression to 1 yr. Results are presented using descriptive statistics. A mixed model for repeated measures was fitted to estimate the mean scores at each scheduled visit during treatment.  Results:   At final analysis, with 52 mo follow-up for survival, the median treatment duration was 32.9 mo for apalutamide and 11.5 mo for placebo. Patients had good baseline HRQoL. At each scheduled collection during treatment, >90% per group completed the questionnaires. The change in FACT-P total score from baseline to cycles 21 and 25 significantly favored apalutamide over placebo (p = 0.0138 and 0.0009, respectively). The apalutamide group generally maintained favorable FACT-P (total and subscales) and EQ-5D-3L scores, while placebo scores tended to decline over time (starting in cycles 11-13 and pronounced by cycles 21-25). Notably, patient-reported fatigue did not worsen with apalutamide. Most patients reported being ""not at all bothered"" by side effects, and bother did not increase over time with apalutamide or placebo. Patients receiving apalutamide had minimal change in side-effect bother following symptomatic adverse events.  Conclusions:   Final analysis of SPARTAN confirms that HRQoL is preserved in patients with nmCRPC receiving apalutamide plus ADT, but declines in patients receiving placebo plus ADT after approximately 1 yr.  Patient summary:   Responses from patients with prostate cancer who were included in the SPARTAN study indicated that treatment with apalutamide, even after the most extensive follow-up time possible, did not reduce their quality of life. These results, along with improved survival and longer time to the development of metastases (reported separately), confirm the benefits of apalutamide for patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Stéphane Oudard', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Fred Saad', 'David Cella', 'Ethan Basch', 'Julie N Graff', 'Hiroji Uemura', 'Shiva Dibaj', 'Susan Li', 'Sabine D Brookman-May', 'Peter De Porre', 'Katherine B Bevans', 'Jeremiah J Trudeau', 'Eric J Small', 'Matthew R Smith']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Effect of apalutamide on health-related quality of life in patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: an analysis of the SPARTAN randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.', 'Deep Prostate-specific Antigen Response following Addition of Apalutamide to Ongoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Long-term Clinical Benefit in SPARTAN.', 'Health-related quality of life after apalutamide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (TITAN): a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.', 'Apalutamide: A Review in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Apalutamide: A new agent in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Health-related quality of life in GALAHAD: A multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study of niraparib for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA-repair gene defects.', 'Assessment and Management of Cognitive Function in Patients with Prostate Cancer Treated with Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Pathway Inhibitors.', 'Apalutamide, Darolutamide and Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (nmCRPC): A Critical Review.']"""

The benefit of SBRT may be further harnessed especially when radiating disease from primary malignancies with low alpha-beta ratios in order to maximize the magnitude and durability of pain relief. However, such an approach has not been studied in a prospective trial. We look to assess single-fraction SBRT for painful non-spinal bone metastases from radioresistant primaries.  Methods:   Forty patients will be enrolled on an open label, phase II single arm trial to receive a single fraction of SBRT (15-20 Gray) to all sites of bone metastases requiring treatment for pain relief. Eligible patients will include those with primary malignancies consisting of prostate cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or melanoma. The primary endpoint is pain response at 3 months post-treatment using the Brief Pain Inventory. Secondary endpoints include pain response at 1 month and 6 months post-treatment, toxicity, patient-reported quality of life, re-irradiation or salvage surgery, and local control.  Discussion:   This study will evaluate the efficacy of single-fraction SBRT on painful bone metastases from primary cancers with low alpha-beta ratios.

Methods:   A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed. The starting model population was men with mean age of 65 years referred for a first prostate biopsy due to clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. The six diagnostic strategies were selected for their relevance to local clinical practice. They comprised MRI targeted biopsy following a positive pre-biopsy multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) [Prostate Imaging - Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score ≥ 3], systematic biopsy, or saturation biopsy employed in different testing combinations and sequences. Deterministic base case analyses with sensitivity analyses were performed using costs from the healthcare system perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained as the outcome measure to yield incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).  Results:   Deterministic base case analyses showed that Strategy 1 (MRI targeted biopsy alone), Strategy 2 (MRI targeted biopsy ➔ systematic biopsy), and Strategy 4 (MRI targeted biopsy ➔ systematic biopsy ➔ saturation biopsy) were cost-effective options at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$20,000, with ICERs ranging from US$18,975 to US$19,458. Strategies involving MRI targeted biopsy in the repeat biopsy setting were dominated. Sensitivity analyses found the ICERs were affected mostly by changes to the annual discounting rate and prevalence of prostate cancer in men referred for first biopsy, ranging between US$15,755 to US$23,022. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed Strategy 1 to be the least costly, and Strategies 2 and 4 being the preferred strategies when WTP thresholds were US$20,000 and US$30,000, respectively.

Mice bearing prostate cancer xenografts were exposed to various treatment conditions including 1% (v/v) Definity microbubbles stimulated at ultrasound pressures 246 kPa and 570 kPa and HT duration of 0, 10, 40, and 50 min. Ultrasound radiofrequency (RF) data were collected using an ultrasound transducer with a central frequency of 25 MHz. QUS parameters based on form factor models were used as potential biomarkers of cell death in prostate cancer xenografts.  Results:   The average acoustic concentration (AAC) parameter from spherical gaussian and the fluid-filled spherical models were the most efficient imaging biomarker of cell death. Statistical significant increases of AAC were found in the combined treatment groups: 246 kPa + 40 min, 246 kPa + 50 min, and 570 kPa + 50 min, in comparison with control tumours (0 kPa + 0 min). Changes in AAC correlates strongly (r2 = 0.62) with cell death fraction quantified from the histopathological analysis.

Methods:   Forty-five thoracic and lumbar vertebrae were obtained from cadaver spines of 11 donors with breast, esophageal, kidney, lung, or prostate cancer. Each vertebra was imaged using microCT (21.4 μm), vBMD, and bone volume to total volume were computed, and compressive strength and stiffness experimentally measured. The microCT images were reconstructed at 1-mm voxel size to simulate axial and sagittal clinical CT images. Five expert clinicians blindly classified the images according to bone lesion quality (osteolytic, osteoblastic, mixed, or healthy). Fleiss' kappa test was used to test agreement among 5 clinical raters for classifying bone lesion quality. Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was used to test the difference in vertebral strength and stiffness based on bone lesion quality. Multivariable regression analysis was used to test the independent contribution of bone lesion quality, computed vBMD, age, gender, and race for predicting vertebral strength and stiffness.  Results:   A low interrater agreement was found for bone lesion quality (κ = 0.19). Although the osteoblastic vertebrae showed significantly higher strength than osteolytic vertebrae (p = 0.0148), the multivariable analysis showed that bone lesion quality explained 19% of the variability in vertebral strength and 13% in vertebral stiffness. The computed vBMD explained 75% of vertebral strength (p < 0.0001) and 48% of stiffness (p < 0.0001) variability. The type of BM affected vBMD-based estimates of vertebral strength, explaining 75% of strength variability in osteoblastic vertebrae (R2 = 0.75, p < 0.0001) but only 41% in vertebrae with mixed bone metastasis (R2 = 0.41, p = 0.0168), and 39% in osteolytic vertebrae (R2 = 0.39, p = 0.0381). For vertebral stiffness, vBMD was only associated with that of osteoblastic vertebrae (R2 = 0.44, p = 0.0024). Age and race inconsistently affected the model's strength and stiffness predictions.  Conclusions:   Pathologic vertebral fracture occurs when the metastatic lesion degrades vertebral strength, rendering it unable to carry daily loads. This study demonstrated the limitation of qualitative clinical classification of bone lesion quality for predicting pathologic vertebral strength and stiffness. Computed CT-derived vBMD more reliably estimated vertebral strength and stiffness. Replacing the qualitative clinical classification with computed vBMD estimates may improve the prediction of vertebral fracture risk.""","""['Ron N Alkalay', 'Michael W Groff', 'Marc A Stadelmann', 'Florian M Buck', 'Sven Hoppe', 'Nicolas Theumann', 'Umesh Mektar', 'Roger B Davis', 'David B Hackney']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Neurosurg Spine""","""[""Conventional finite element models estimate the strength of metastatic human vertebrae despite alterations of the bone's tissue and structure."", 'Accuracy of iodine density thresholds for the separation of vertebral bone metastases from healthy-appearing trabecular bone in spectral detector computed tomography.', 'Combining areal DXA bone mineral density and vertebrae postero-anterior width improves the prediction of vertebral strength.', 'Correlation of vertebral strength topography with 3-dimensional computed tomographic structure.', 'Female Human Spines with Simulated Osteolytic Defects: CT-based Structural Analysis of Vertebral Body Strength.', 'Evaluation of Load-To-Strength Ratios in Metastatic Vertebrae and Comparison With Age- and Sex-Matched Healthy Individuals.', 'Finite Element Analysis of Osteoporotic and Osteoblastic Vertebrae and Its Association With the Proton Density Fat Fraction From Chemical Shift Encoding-Based Water-Fat MRI - A Preliminary Study.']"""

In this current investigation, gum acacia - poly ethylene glycol grafted iron oxide nanocomposite (GA-PEG-IONC) was synthesised by in situ green science principles. The synthesised Nanocomposite was evaluated against the molecular mechanism of urinary tract pathogenic bacterial strains and prostate cancer cells (Pc 3). Nanocomposite prepared in this examination exhibited notable structural, functional stability with nanoarchitecture which was affirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), electron microscopic studies, atomic force microscopy (AFM), vibrating sample magnetometric analysis (VSM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), Synthesised Nanocomposite brought about notable antibacterial activity against urinary tract pathogenic strains by recording potential inhibitory effect on the expression of Las R gene. Inhibition of Las R gene expression reduced notable effect on biofilm development. Anticancer activity against prostate cancer cells (Pc3) was investigated by measurement of HOXB13 gene expression level. Inhibition of HOXB13 gene expression by the IONC brought about structural, functional changes. HOXB13 gene expression inhibition reveals a remarkable cytotoxic effect by recording decreased cell viability. Morphometric analysis by phase-contrast and DAPI fluorescence staining demonstrates that the Nanocomposite prompted cell morphology anomalies or apoptotic changes. Nanocomposite treatment brought about a good sign of Apoptosis by recording enhanced caspase 3 and 9 activities, DNA fragmentation and elevated reactive oxygen species generation (ROS). Hemocompatibility studies were carried out to determine the biocompatibility of the Nanocomposite. Spectrophotometric estimation of plasma haemoglobin, microscopic examination of whole blood cells shows the Nanocomposite was not inciting any indication of toxicity.

Differences were investigated using analysis-of-variance for acute and analysis-of-covariance for chronic effects.  Results:   Acute exercise: IDO levels changed over time with a significant increase from post-CPET to 1 h post-CPET (p = 0.03). KIR2DL1 levels significantly decreased over time (p < 0.01).

Diet may affect BA metabolism and signaling; however, evidence from human populations is lacking.  Objectives:   We systematically investigated cross-sectional associations of a priori-selected dietary components (fiber, alcohol, coffee, fat) with circulating BA concentrations.  Methods:   We used targeted, quantitative LC-MS/MS panels to measure 15 circulating BAs in a subset of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC; n = 2224) and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO; n = 986) comprising Finnish male smokers and United States men and women, respectively. We used multivariable linear regression to estimate associations of each dietary component with log-transformed BAs; exponentiated coefficients estimate proportional differences. We included the median of the dietary component quartile in linear regression models to test for trend.  Results:   In ATBC, fiber was inversely associated with multiple circulating BAs. The proportional difference was -10.09% (95% CI: -19.29 to 0.16; P-trend = 0.04) when comparing total BAs among those in the highest relative to the lowest fiber quartile. Alcohol, trans fat, and polyunsaturated fat were positively associated with BAs in ATBC. The proportional difference comparing total BAs among those in the highest relative to the lowest alcohol quartile was 8.76% (95% CI: -3.10 to 22.06; P-trend = 0.03). Coffee and monounsaturated fat were inversely associated with BAs. The proportional difference comparing total BAs among those in the highest relative to the lowest coffee quartile was -24.03% (95% CI: -31.57 to -15.66; P-trend < 0.0001). In PLCO, no dietary components were associated with BAs except fiber, which was inversely associated with tauroursodeoxycholic acid.  Conclusions:   Alcohol, coffee, certain fat subtypes, and fiber were associated with circulating concentrations of multiple BAs among Finnish male smokers. Given the potential role of BAs in disease risk, further investigation of the effects of diet on BAs in humans is warranted.""","""['Doratha A Byrd', 'Rashmi Sinha', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Neal D Freedman', 'Joshua Sampson', 'Erikka Loftfield']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Clin Nutr""","""['Circulating Bile Acids and Adenoma Recurrence in the Context of Adherence to a High-Fiber, High-Fruit and Vegetable, and Low-Fat Dietary Intervention.', 'Prospective Associations of Circulating Bile Acids and Short-Chain Fatty Acids With Incident Colorectal Cancer.', 'Associations between Dietary Patterns and Bile Acids-Results from a Cross-Sectional Study in Vegans and Omnivores.', 'Fiber, Fat, and Colorectal Cancer: New Insight into Modifiable Dietary Risk Factors.', 'Toward a dietary prevention of cancer.', 'Uygur type 2 diabetes patient fecal microbiota transplantation disrupts blood glucose and bile acid levels by changing the ability of the intestinal flora to metabolize bile acids in C57BL/6 mice.', 'Circulating Bile Acids and Adenoma Recurrence in the Context of Adherence to a High-Fiber, High-Fruit and Vegetable, and Low-Fat Dietary Intervention.', 'Restoration of cefixime-induced gut microbiota changes by a prebiotic blend in a mouse model.', 'A prospective investigation of serum bile acids with risk of liver cancer, fatal liver disease, and biliary tract cancer.']"""

Recently, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was identified as a cancer biomarker due to its continued release from cancer cells compared to normal cells. The precise monitoring and quantification of H2O2 are hindered by its low concentration and the limit of detection (LOD) in traditional sensing methods. Plasmon-assisted electrochemical sensors with their high sensitivity and low LOD make a suitable candidate for effective detection of H2O2, yet their electrical properties need to be improved. Here, we propose a new nanostructured microfluidic device for ultrasensitive, quantitative detection of H2O2 released from cancer cells in a portable fashion. The fluidic device features a series of self-organized gold nanocavities, enhanced with graphene nanosheets having optoelectrical properties, which facilitate the plasmon-assisted electrochemical detection of H2O2 released from human cells. Remarkably, the device can successfully measure the released H2O2 from breast cancer (MCF-7) and prostate cancer (PC3) cells in human plasma. Briefly, direct amperometric detection of H2O2 under simulated visible light illumination showed a superb LOD of 1 pM in a linear range of 1 pM-10 μM. We thoroughly studied the formation of self-organized plasmonic nanocavities on gold electrodes via surface and photo-electrochemical characterization techniques. In addition, the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) simulation of the electric field demonstrates the intensity of charge distribution at the nanocavity structure edges under visible light illumination. The superb LOD of the proposed electrode combining gold plasmonic nanocavities and graphene sheets paves the way for the development of non-invasive plasmon-assisted electrochemical sensors that can effectively detect low concentrations of H2O2 released from cancer cells.""","""['Carolina Del Real Mata', 'Roozbeh Siavash Moakhar', 'Imman I Hosseini', 'Mahsa Jalali', 'Sara Mahshid']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['A Nanostructured Gold/Graphene Microfluidic Device for Direct and Plasmonic-Assisted Impedimetric Detection of Bacteria.', 'In Situ Electrochemical Sensing and Real-Time Monitoring Live Cells Based on Freestanding Nanohybrid Paper Electrode Assembled from 3D Functionalized Graphene Framework.', 'Stamped multilayer graphene laminates for disposable in-field electrodes: application to electrochemical sensing of hydrogen peroxide and glucose.', 'Recent advances in graphene-based nanomaterials for fabricating electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensors.', 'Electrodes and electrocatalysts for electrochemical hydrogen peroxide sensors: a review of design strategies.', 'MoS2-Plasmonic Nanocavities for Raman Spectra of Single Extracellular Vesicles Reveal Molecular Progression in Glioblastoma.', 'Exploring the Bottom-Up Growth of Anisotropic Gold Nanoparticles from Substrate-Bound Seeds in Microfluidic Reactors.', 'Graphene-Based Electrochemical Biosensors for Breast Cancer Detection.', 'A Versatile Biomimic Nanotemplating Fluidic Assay for Multiplex Quantitative Monitoring of Viral Respiratory Infections and Immune Responses in Saliva and Blood.']"""

To enhance the therapeutic effects of radioligands labeled with 225Ac (half-life: 10 days), a radioligand that shows longer tumor retention would be useful. Here, we designed and synthesized a straight-chain PSMA-targeting radioligand, PSMA-DA1, which includes an (iodophenyl)butyric acid derivative as an albumin binder (ALB). We performed preclinical evaluations of PSMA-DA1 as a tool for PSMA-targeting radiotheranostics using 111In, 90Y, and 225Ac. [111In]In-PSMA-DA1 demonstrated significantly greater tumor uptake and retention than a corresponding non-ALB-conjugated compound. In mice, single-photon emission computed tomography performed with [111In]In-PSMA-DA1 produced clear tumor images, and the administration of [90Y]Y-PSMA-DA1 or [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-DA1 inhibited tumor growth. [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-DA1 had antitumor effects in mice at a lower radioactivity level than [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-617, which has been reported to be clinically useful.

Methods:   Between October 2008 and September 2019, data from a retrospective multicenter study (N.=4 centers), involving patients undergoing 18F-choline PET/CT scans for a biochemical recurrence of PCa, were collected. The following inclusion criteria were used: 1) histologically proven PCa; 2) a non-metastatic disease in accordance with conventional imaging findings; 3) a PSA doubling time (PSAdt) <10 months; 4) a GS>8; and 5) no pelvic node>2 cm. The group of hsPCa and CRPCa patients, were compared by using a non-parametric statistical analysis. Moreover, a logistic regression analysis and ROC curves were used.  Results:   One hundred forty patients were included. Of these, 82 patients were affected by hsPCa, and 58 had a CRPCa. Overall, 18F-Choline PET/CT was positive in 99/140 (70.7%). It was positive in 55/82 (67.1%) hsPCa patients and in 44/58 (75.9%) CRPCa subjects, respectively. The site of recurrence at 18F-Choline PET/CT were: 16 (27.6%) and 20 (24.4%) in prostatic bed, 25 (43.1%) and 24 (29.3%) in loco-regional lymph nodes and in 27 (46.6%) and 28 (34.1%) in distant organs, respectively for CRPCa and hsPCa patients. The optimal cut-off values for PSA at the time of PET/CT for the prediction or recurrence were 0.5 vs. 2.5 ng/mL for all site of recurrence (AUC: 0.70 vs. 0.72), 0.48 vs. 3.4 ng/mL for prostatic bed (AUC: 0.60 vs. 0.59), 0.5 vs. 1.5 for loco-regional lymph nodes (AUC: 0.62 vs. 0.57) and 2.2 vs. 2.8 ng/mL for distant metastasis (AUC: 0.74 vs. 0.71), respectively in CRPCa and hsPCa (all P=NS). Sensitivities and specificities of 18F-Choline PET/CT for the identification of recurrence disease in all patient population, in hsPCa and CRPCa were 83.7% and 87.5%, 78.9% and 88.9%, 91.4% and 85.7%, respectively.  Conclusions:   The rate of positive 18F-Choline PET/CT is similar in patients with a hsPCa and CRPCa, in case of low PSAdt and high GS.

Methods:   Approximations of sensitivities in detecting lymph node metastasis from current publications depending on the number of removed lymph nodes were used for a theoretical deduction of a simplified formulation of npv assuming a false node positivity of 0.

Methods: Sixty-seven men (group 1) with documented metastatic PCa underwent 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-NaF PET/CT and a subgroup of 30 men (group 2) underwent additional imaging with 18F-FDG PET/CT. The tracers were compared for their detection rates, imaging concordance, associations with prostate-specific antigen (PSA), treatment at the time of imaging, and castration status. Results: Overall, 61 men had metastatic disease detected on one or more scans, and 6 men had no disease uptake on any of the PET/CT scans (and were subsequently excluded from the analysis). In group 1, 18F-NaF detected significantly more metastatic lesions than 18F-DCFPyL (median of 3 lesions vs. 2, P = 0.001) even after eliminating benign causes of 18F-NaF uptake. This difference was particularly clear for men receiving treatment (P = 0.005) or who were castration-resistant (P = 0.014). The median percentage of bone lesions that were concordant on 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-NaF was 50%. In group 2, 18F-DCFPyL detected more lesions than 18F-FDG (median of 5 lesions vs. 2, P = 0.0003), regardless of PSA level, castration status, or treatment. The median percentage of lesions that were concordant on 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FDG was 22.2%. This percentage was slightly higher for castration-resistant than castration-sensitive men (P = 0.048). Conclusion:18F-DCFPyL PET/CT is the most versatile of the 3 PET agents for metastatic PCa; however, 18F-NaF detects more bone metastases. Imaging reveals substantial tumor heterogeneity with only 50% concordance between 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-NaF and 22% concordance for 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-FDG.

The widespread use of androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors has generated an increased incidence of AR-negative prostate cancer, triggering the need for effective therapies for such patients. Here, analysis of public genome-wide CRISPR screens in human prostate cancer cell lines identified histone demethylase JMJD1C (KDM3C) as an AR-negative context-specific vulnerability. Secondary validation studies in multiple cell lines and organoids, including isogenic models, confirmed that small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of JMJD1C potently inhibited growth specifically in AR-negative prostate cancer cells. To explore the cooperative interactions of AR and JMJD1C, we performed comparative transcriptomics of 1) isogenic AR-positive versus AR-negative prostate cancer cells, 2) AR-positive versus AR-negative prostate cancer tumors, and 3) isogenic JMJD1C-expressing versus JMJD1C-depleted AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Loss of AR or JMJD1C generates a modest tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) signature, whereas combined loss of AR and JMJD1C strongly up-regulates the TNFα signature in human prostate cancer, suggesting TNFα signaling as a point of convergence for the combined actions of AR and JMJD1C. Correspondingly, AR-negative prostate cancer cells showed exquisite sensitivity to TNFα treatment and, conversely, TNFα pathway inhibition via inhibition of its downstream effector MAP4K4 partially reversed the growth defect of JMJD1C-depleted AR-negative prostate cancer cells. Given the deleterious systemic side effects of TNFα therapy in humans and the viability of JMJD1C-knockout mice, the identification of JMJD1C inhibition as a specific vulnerability in AR-negative prostate cancer may provide an alternative drug target for prostate cancer patients progressing on AR inhibitor therapy.""","""['Yohei Yoshihama', 'Kyle A LaBella', 'Eiru Kim', 'Lori Bertolet', 'Medina Colic', 'Jiexi Li', 'Xiaoying Shang', 'Chang-Jiun Wu', 'Denise J Spring', 'Y Alan Wang', 'Traver Hart', 'Ronald A DePinho']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['A novel variant of the putative demethylase gene, s-JMJD1C, is a coactivator of the AR.', 'Critical role of Jumonji domain of JMJD1C in MLL-rearranged leukemia.', 'Lgr4 promotes prostate tumorigenesis through the Jmjd2a/AR signaling pathway.', 'Histone demethylase JMJD1C promotes the polarization of M1 macrophages to prevent glioma by upregulating miR-302a.', 'Crucial Functions of the JMJD1/KDM3 Epigenetic Regulators in Cancer.', 'CRISPR Screen Contributes to Novel Target Discovery in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, it has been reported that the use of ADT is significantly associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) among patients with newly diagnosed non-metastatic PCa. We investigated changes in renal function that occurred in Japanese patients with PCa after ADT was discontinued.  Patients and methods:   Among 121 patients who underwent prostate biopsies, were pathologically diagnosed with PCa, and received ADT for ≥6 months at our Institution between 2009 and 2014, 60 patients who underwent radiotherapy for stage B or C PCa were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective study. Renal function was assessed using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the initiation of ADT and the rate of change in the eGFR (ΔeGFR) during ADT and after the discontinuation of ADT was investigated. We divided patients into two groups: Group 1 received ADT for 6 months, and group 2 received ADT for 12 months. Age; ΔeGFR; prostate-specific antigen, testosterone and hemoglobin levels; clinical stage; Gleason score; comorbidities; body mass index; heart rate; and the cardiothoracic ratio were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 60 patients (group 1: n=23, group 2: n=37) were analyzed. The Gleason score of group 2 was higher than that of group 1 (p=0.0011). Regarding clinical stage, group 1 had more patients with stage B disease, and group 2 had more with stage C (p<0.0001). The eGFR decreased with the duration of ADT treatment. At 12 months, renal function had started to recover in group 1, while it had continued to decrease in group 2.  Conclusion:   Discontinuation of ADT tended to result in improvements in renal function. Furthermore, this study indicated that renal dysfunction caused by 6 months of ADT is transient. Normalization of the serum testosterone level seen after the discontinuation of ADT may be associated with improvements in renal function. Thus, intermittent ADT may be a useful treatment for PCa, as it would help to preserve renal function.""","""['Hiroshi Masuda', 'Ayumi Fujimoto', 'Manato Kanesaka', 'Kyokusin Hou', 'Takahito Suyama', 'Kazuhiro Araki', 'Satoko Kojima', 'Yukio Naya']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['The Association Between Hot Flashes and Renal Dysfunction After Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Radiotherapy in Japanese Patients With High-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Renal Impairment: A Major Adverse Event in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Long-term effects of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Impact of Hypertension on Early Renal Dysfunction in Japanese Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Improving the management of patients with prostate cancer receiving long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Changes in Renal Function of Patients With Prostate Cancer: Focus on Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'The Association Between Hot Flashes and Renal Dysfunction After Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Radiotherapy in Japanese Patients With High-risk Prostate Cancer.']"""

Yet, while bone function highly depends on mechanical stimulation, the effects of biomechanical stimuli on the bone marrow niche, specifically on bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is poorly understood due to a lack of representative in vitro loading models. Here, we engineered a BMAT analog made of a GelMA (gelatin methacryloyl) hydrogel/medical-grade polycaprolactone (mPCL) scaffold composite to structurally and biologically mimic key aspects of the bone marrow microenvironment, and exploited an innovative bioreactor to study the effects of mechanical loading. Highly reproducible BMAT analogs facilitated the successful adipogenesis of human mesenchymal bone marrow stem cells. Upon long-term intermittent stimulation (1 Hz, 2 h/day, 3 days/week, 3 weeks) in the novel bioreactor, cellular proliferation and lipid accumulation were similar to unloaded controls, yet there was a significant reduction in the secretion of adipokines including leptin and adiponectin, in line with clinical evidence of reduced adipokine expression following exercise/activity. Ultimately, this innovative loading platform combined with reproducibly engineered BMAT analogs provide opportunities to study marrow physiology in greater complexity as it accounts for the dynamic mechanical microenvironment context.""","""['Akhilandeshwari Ravichandran', 'Christoph Meinert', 'Onur Bas', 'Dietmar W Hutmacher', 'Nathalie Bock']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mater Sci Eng C Mater Biol Appl""","""['Development of a 3D bone marrow adipose tissue model.', 'Effect of kartogenin-loaded gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel scaffold with bone marrow stimulation for enthesis healing in rotator cuff repair.', 'Organotypic culture of human bone marrow adipose tissue.', 'The Implications of Bone Marrow Adipose Tissue on Inflammaging.', 'Development, regulation, metabolism and function of bone marrow adipose tissues.', 'GelMA, Click-Chemistry Gelatin and Bioprinted Polyethylene Glycol-Based Hydrogels as 3D Ex Vivo Drug Testing Platforms for Patient-Derived Breast Cancer Organoids.', 'Bone Marrow Niches of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells.']"""

To date, numerous sophisticated nano-formulations as radiosensitizers have been synthesized with inspiring therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo; however, almost all the attention has been paid on the enhanced dose deposition effect by secondary electrons of nanomaterials with high atomic numbers (Z); despite this, cell-cycle arrest, DNA damage, and also reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are critical working mechanisms that account for radiosensitization. Herein, an 'all-purpose' nanostrategy based on dose deposition enhancement, cell cycle arrest, and ROS production as prostate cancer radiosensitizer for potential clinical translation was proposed. The rather simple structure of docetaxel-loaded Au nanoparticles (NPs) with prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand conjugation have been successfully synthesized. Enhanced cellular uptake achieved via the selective internalization of the NPs by PCa cells with positive PSMA expression could guarantee enhanced dose deposition. Moreover, the as-synthesized nanosystem could effectively arrest the cell cycle at G2/M phases, which would reduce the ability of DNA damage repair for more irradiation sensitive of the PCa cells. Moreover, the G2/M phase arrest would further promote cascade retention and the enrichment of NPs within the cells. Furthermore, ROS generation and double strand breaks greatly promoted by NPs under irradiation (IR) could also provide an underlying basis for effective radiosensitizers. In vitro and in vivo investigations confirmed the as-synthesized NPs as an effective nano-radiosensitizer with ideal safety. More importantly, all moieties within the present nanosystem have been approved by FDA for the purpose of PCa treatment, thus making it highly attractive for clinical translation.""","""['Xiao-Xiao Guo', 'Zhen-Hu Guo', 'Jing-Song Lu', 'Wen-Sheng Xie', 'Qiu-Zi Zhong', 'Xiao-Dan Sun', 'Xiu-Mei Wang', 'Jian-Ye Wang', 'Ming Liu', 'Ling-Yun Zhao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Correction: All-purpose nanostrategy based on dose deposition enhancement, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and ROS production as prostate cancer radiosensitizer for potential clinical translation.', 'Correction: All-purpose nanostrategy based on dose deposition enhancement, cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and ROS production as prostate cancer radiosensitizer for potential clinical translation.', 'TiO2 nanoparticles induce DNA double strand breaks and cell cycle arrest in human alveolar cells.', 'A ROS-responsive polymeric prodrug nanosystem with self-amplified drug release for PSMA (-) prostate cancer specific therapy.', 'Photothermal exposure of polydopamine-coated branched Au-Ag nanoparticles induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Effect of Gold Nanoparticle Radiosensitization on Plasmid DNA Damage Induced by High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy.', 'Immunogenic radiation therapy for enhanced anti-tumor immunity via core-shell nanocomposite-mediated multiple strategies.', 'Individual radiosensitivity reflected by γ-H2AX and 53BP1 foci predicts outcome in PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy.']"""

Methods:   Reporting of all cases of cancer by insurers and providers is mandatory by law. Data gathered include demographic and clinical information about new and old cases of cancer who receive health services. Over the years, the reporting process has been automated and it is currently performed in real time. Data quality is ensured through a standardized data-monitoring process. Access to health services is monitored by quality measures defined by consensus.  Results:   Since 2015, prevalent cases of invasive cancer have increased from 163,776 to 331,021 in 2020 (increment of 102.12%). Regarding quality measures, the proportion of people staged at diagnosis has increased over the years, especially in breast cancer.

Materials and methods:   We reported 1.077 men who underwent RARP as the primary treatment for localized prostate cancer from 2013 to 2017. Patients were classified as non-obese (normal BMI or overweight) or obese men (BMI ≥30kg/m2). They were grouped according to the age, PSA level, D'Amico risk group, Gleason score, ASA classification, pathological stage, prostate volume, salvage/adjuvant radiotherapy, perioperative complications, and follow-up time. Urinary continence was defined as the use of no pads. For the analysis of long-term urinary continence recovery, we conducted a 1:1 propensity-score matching to control confounders.  Results:   Among the obese patients, mean BMI was 32.8kg/m2, ranging 30 - 45.7kg/m2. Only 2% was morbidly obese. Obese presented more comorbidities and larger prostates. Median follow-up time was 15 months for the obese. Complications classified as Clavien ≥3 were reported in 5.6% of the obese and in 4.4% of the non-obese men (p=0.423). Median time for continence recovery was 4 months in both groups. In this analysis, HR was 0.989 for urinary continence recovery in obese (95%CI=0.789 - 1.240; p=0.927).

Whether new-generation anti-androgens, like apalutamide, can improve the radio-curability of these patients is an emerging challenge.  Materials and methods:   We comparatively examined the radio-sensitising activity of apalutamide and bicalutamide in hormone-sensitive (22Rv1) and hormone-resistant (PC3, DU145) prostate cancer cell lines. Experiments with xenografts were performed for the 22Rv1 cell line.  Results:   Radiation dose-response viability and clonogenic assays showed that apalutamide had a stronger radio-sensitising activity for all three cell lines. Confocal imaging for γΗ2Αx showed similar DNA double-strand break repair kinetics for apalutamide and bicalutamide. No difference was noted in the apoptotic pathway. A striking cell death pattern involving nuclear karyorrhexis and cell pyknosis in the G1/S phase was exclusively noted when radiation was combined with apalutamide. In vivo experiments in SCID and R2G2 mice showed significantly higher efficacy of radiotherapy (2 and 4 Gy) when combined with apalutamide, resulting in extensive xenograft necrosis.  Conclusions:   In vitro and in vivo experiments support the superiority of apalutamide over bicalutamide in combination with radiotherapy in prostate cancer. Clinical studies are encouraged to show whether replacement of bicalutamide with apalutamide may improve the curability rates.""","""['Christos Kakouratos#', 'Dimitra Kalamida#', 'Ioannis Lamprou', 'Erasmia Xanthopoulou', 'Christos Nanos', 'Alexandra Giatromanolaki', 'Michael I Koukourakis']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Comparison of the effect of the antiandrogen apalutamide (ARN-509) versus bicalutamide on the androgen receptor pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Antagonistic interaction between bicalutamide (Casodex) and radiation in androgen-positive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'CH5137291, an androgen receptor nuclear translocation-inhibiting compound, inhibits the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Bicalutamide (Casodex) in the treatment of prostate cancer: history of clinical development.', 'Apalutamide: First Global Approval.', 'Absence of PSA Flare With Apalutamide Administered 1 Hour in Advance With GnRH Agonists: Case Report.', 'Androgen and oestrogen receptor co-expression determines the efficacy of hormone receptor-mediated radiosensitisation in breast cancer.', 'Estrogen receptor inhibition mediates radiosensitization of ER-positive breast cancer models.']"""

However, the role of YAP1 in prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, and metastasis is not well defined. Through functional, transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses, we showed that prolyl hydroxylation of YAP1 plays a critical role in the suppression of cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of YAP1 led to an increase in cell migration, invasion, and metastasis in prostate cancer cells. Microarray analysis showed that the EMT pathway was activated in Yap1-KD cells. ChIP-seq analysis showed that YAP1 target genes are enriched in pathways regulating cell migration. Mass spectrometry analysis identified P4H prolyl hydroxylase in the YAP1 complex and YAP1 was hydroxylated at multiple proline residues. Proline-to-alanine mutations of YAP1 isoform 3 identified proline 174 as a critical residue, and its hydroxylation suppressed cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. KO of P4ha2 led to an increase in cell migration and invasion, which was reversed upon Yap1 KD.

Methods:   We evaluated 213 patients with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent clinical staging with preoperative 68Ga- or 18F-PSMA-PET/CT scan and subsequent RARP with ePLND. Patients were grouped as PSMA- or PSMA+ depending on their LN status on PSMA-PET/CT and subdivided according to histological LN status in pN0 or pN1. Diagnostic accuracy of PSMA-PET/CT for the detection of pN1 was evaluated. BCP was defined as a first postoperative serum PSA level ≥0.1 ng/mL 6-12 weeks following RP. Early BCR was defined as detectable PSA > 0.2 ng/mL within 12 months of follow-up. Univariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the effect of PSMA+ on BCP and BCR.  Results:   Forty patients (19%) were PSMA+. The overall incidence of pN1 was 23%. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV on a per patient level for the detection of pN1 was 29%, 84%, 35%, and 80% respectively. BCP was observed in 26 of 211 patients (12%) and early BCR in 23 of 110 patients (21%). The presence of PSMA+ was a significant predictor for BCP (OR 7.1, 2.9-17.1 95% CI) and BCR (OR 8.1, 2.9-22.6 95% CI).

Method:   A total of 3386 men and women aged 40 to 70 completed an online survey about prostate or breast cancer screening. Participants were randomly assigned to either an unbeneficial test condition (0 lives saved due to screening) or a beneficial test condition (1 life saved due to screening). Participants then reviewed 4 informational interventions about either breast (women) or prostate (men) cancer screening. First, participants were provided didactic information alongside an explicit recommendation. This was followed by a descriptive harms intervention in which the possible harms of overdetection were explained. Participants then viewed 2 additional interventions: a narrative and ARISE (an intervention in which participants learned about probabilities by viewing simulated outcomes). The order of these last 2 interventions was randomized. Preference for being screened with the test and knowledge about the test were measured.  Results:   With each successive intervention, preferences for screening tests decreased an equivalent amount for both a beneficial and unbeneficial test.

Materials and methods:   The mCRPC patients who received at least one cycle of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT with or without AA therapy, were included and analyzed in the present study. The patients were divided into two major groups. Group 1 received only 177 Lu-PSMA PRLT and Group 2 received combined 177 Lu-PSMA PRLT + AA therapy. Therapeutic dose of 177 Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT was 4.4-5.55 GBq per patient per cycle administered at intervals of 10-12 weeks in both groups. The Group 2 patients additionally received a dose of 1000 mg of AA once daily and 5 mg of prednisone twice daily. Treatment response in two groups was evaluated under four broad categories (a) symptomatic, (b) biochemical (serum prostate-specific antigen level), (c) objective molecular imaging (68 Ga-PSMA-11 and 18 F-FDG PET/CT), and (d) objective anatomical imaging (computed tomography). For assessing treatment response, patients in two groups were categorized into responders (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and stable disease [SD]) and nonresponders (progressive disease [PD]). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate PFS and OS following first 177 Lu-PSMA PRLT in the two groups. Univariate analysis was used to compare the patients' characteristics in two groups using a χ2 or Fisher exact test. The Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS and OS between two groups were compared by using the log-rank test (p < 0.05 significant).  Results:   A total of 58 mCRPC patients (Group 1, 38 patients and Group 2, 20 patients) were included in this study analysis. The clinical and demographic characteristics of these patients (age, Gleason score, FDG avid disease, metastatic disease burden, and average number of 177 Lu-PSMA PRLT cycles) in two groups were compared and found to be similar (p > 0.05). Post-treatment, symptomatic, biochemical, molecular, and anatomic imaging responders were found in 22 patients (58%) and 17 patients (85%), 22 patients (58%) and 16 patients (80%), 19 patients (54%) and 14 patients (78%), and 19 patients (54%) and 14 patients (78%) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The median PFS of 7 months and median OS of 8 months were documented in Group 1, whereas median PFS was not reached and median OS of 16 months registered in Group 2. Transient hematological toxicity of Grades 1 and 2 was found in total seven patients (five patients in Group 1 and two patients in Group 2). On comparison of the treatment outcome between two groups, significant p value was found for symptomatic responders (58% in Group 1 vs. 85% in Group 2), median PFS (7 months in Group 1 vs. not reached in Group 2), and median OS (8 months in Group 1 vs. 16 months in Group 2), with better outcome in Group 2 patients for these variables.

Imipramine, an FDA-approved tricyclic antidepressant, has been commonly used to relieve depressive symptoms in the clinic. Recently, imipramine has been reported to participate in the suppression of tumour progression in several human cancers, including prostate cancer, colon cancer and lymphomas. However, the effect of imipramine on malignant glioma is largely unclear. Here, we show that imipramine significantly retarded proliferation of immortalized and primary glioma cells. Mechanistically, imipramine suppressed tumour proliferation by inhibiting yes-associated protein (YAP), a recognized oncogene in glioma, independent of Hippo pathway. In addition to inhibiting YAP transcription, imipramine also promoted the subcellular translocation of YAP from nucleus into cytoplasm. Consistently, imipramine administration significantly reduced orthotopic tumour progression and prolonged survival of tumour-bearing mice. Moreover, exogenous overexpression of YAP partially restored the inhibitory effect of imipramine on glioma progression. Most importantly, compared with imipramine or temozolomide (TMZ) monotherapy, combination therapy with imipramine and TMZ exhibited enhanced inhibitory effect on glioma growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the synergism of both agents. In conclusion, we found that tricyclic antidepressant imipramine impedes glioma progression by inhibiting YAP. In addition, combination therapy with imipramine and TMZ may potentially serve as promising anti-glioma regimens, thus predicting a broad prospect of clinical application.""","""['Yan Wang', 'Xiang Wang', 'Xu Wang', 'Di Wu', 'Ji Qi', 'Yu Zhang', 'Kai Wang', 'Ding Zhou', 'Qing-Ming Meng', 'Er Nie', 'Qiang Wang', 'Ru-Tong Yu', 'Xiu-Ping Zhou']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Cordycepin Augments the Chemosensitivity of Human Glioma Cells to Temozolomide by Activating AMPK and Inhibiting the AKT Signaling Pathway.', 'NVP-BEZ235, a novel dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor displays anti-glioma activity and reduces chemoresistance to temozolomide in human glioma cells.', 'Upregulation of miR-181c contributes to chemoresistance in pancreatic cancer by inactivating the Hippo signaling pathway.', 'YAP/TAZ for cancer therapy: opportunities and challenges (review).', 'Hippo pathway inhibition by blocking the YAP/TAZ-TEAD interface: a patent review.', 'Impact of epigenetic reprogramming on antitumor immune responses in glioma.', 'SU4312 Represses Glioma Progression by Inhibiting YAP and Inducing Sensitization to the Effect of Temozolomide.', 'Antitumoral Effects of Tricyclic Antidepressants: Beyond Neuropathic Pain Treatment.', 'The antidepressant imipramine inhibits breast cancer growth by targeting estrogen receptor signaling and DNA repair events.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Contributed to Dipyridamole-Induced Impaired Autophagic Flux and Glioma Apoptosis.']"""

The purpose of this work is to present a new deep learning-based framework for fast and accurate segmentation of lung tumors on 4D CT image sets.  Methods:   The proposed DL framework leverages motion region convolutional neural network (R-CNN). Through integration of global and local motion estimation network architectures, the network can learn both major and minor changes caused by tumor motion. Our network design first extracts tumor motion information by feeding 4D CT images with consecutive phases into an integrated backbone network architecture, locating volume-of-interest (VOIs) via a regional proposal network and removing irrelevant information via a regional convolutional neural network. Extracted motion information is then advanced into the subsequent global and local motion head network architecture to predict corresponding deformation vector fields (DVFs) and further adjust tumor VOIs. Binary masks of tumors are then segmented within adjusted VOIs via a mask head. A self-attention strategy is incorporated in the mask head network to remove any noisy features that might impact segmentation performance. We performed two sets of experiments. In the first experiment, a five-fold cross-validation on 20 4D CT datasets, each consisting of 10 breathing phases (i.e., 200 3D image volumes in total). The network performance was also evaluated on an additional unseen 200 3D images volumes from 20 hold-out 4D CT datasets. In the second experiment, we trained another model with 40 patients' 4D CT datasets from experiment 1 and evaluated on additional unseen nine patients' 4D CT datasets. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), center of mass distance (CMD), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95 ), mean surface distance (MSD), and volume difference (VD) between the manual and segmented tumor contour were computed to evaluate tumor detection and segmentation accuracy. The performance of our method was quantitatively evaluated against four different methods (VoxelMorph, U-Net, network without global and local networks, and network without attention gate strategy) across all evaluation metrics through a paired t-test.  Results:   The proposed fully automated DL method yielded good overall agreement with the ground truth for contoured tumor volume and segmentation accuracy. Our model yielded significantly better values of evaluation metrics (p < 0.05) than all four competing methods in both experiments. On hold-out datasets of experiment 1 and 2, our method yielded DSC of 0.86 and 0.90 compared to 0.82 and 0.87, 0.75 and 0.83, 081 and 0.89, and 0.81 and 0.89 yielded by VoxelMorph, U-Net, network without global and local networks, and networks without attention gate strategy. Tumor VD between ground truth and our method was the smallest with the value of 0.50 compared to 0.99, 1.01, 0.92, and 0.93 for between ground truth and VoxelMorph, U-Net, network without global and local networks, and networks without attention gate strategy, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our proposed DL framework of tumor segmentation on lung cancer 4D CT datasets demonstrates a significant promise for fully automated delineation. The promising results of this work provide impetus for its integration into the 4D CT treatment planning workflow to improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung radiotherapy.""","""['Shadab Momin', 'Yang Lei', 'Zhen Tian', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Justin Roper', 'Aparna H Kesarwala', 'Kristin Higgins', 'Jeffrey D Bradley', 'Tian Liu', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automated lung tumor delineation on positron emission tomography/computed tomography via a hybrid regional network.', 'Mutual enhancing learning-based automatic segmentation of CT cardiac substructure.', 'U-net-based deformation vector field estimation for motion-compensated 4D-CBCT reconstruction.', 'Automated vessel segmentation in lung CT and CTA images via deep neural networks.', 'A deep learning-based approach to automatic proximal femur segmentation in quantitative CT images.', 'Deformable CT image registration via a dual feasible neural network.']"""

The Common Sense Model proposes that coping with such challenges is related to illness representations: Beliefs regarding consequences, coherence, timeline, and controllability of the illness. We analyzed the interplay of illness representations, coping and anxiety over an 18-month period among men with lPCa undergoing different treatment options (Active Surveillance, curative treatment).  Methods:   In this longitudinal study, 183 men (age M = 66.83) answered a questionnaire before starting treatment, and 6, 12, and 18 months later. We analyzed time trajectories with growth curve modeling and conducted mediation analyses to evaluate the influence of coping on the association of illness representations and anxiety. Using a novel methodological approach, we compared a classic parallel mediation model with a level-contrast approach for the correlated mediators problem- and emotion-focused coping.  Results:   Independent of treatment (b = 1.31, p = 0.200) men reported an elevated level of anxiety after diagnosis which declined considerably within the following 6 months (b = -1.87, p = 0.009). The perceived seriousness of consequences was significantly associated with greater anxiety, at baseline (β = 0.471) and over time (all β ≥ 0.204). This association was mediated by coping: Using more emotion-than problem-focused coping was associated with higher anxiety.  Conclusions:   Receiving a lPCa diagnosis is associated with a phase of increased anxiety. In order to reduce anxiety, information provision should be accompanied by developing concrete action plans to enable problem-focused coping strategies.""","""['Isabella Otto', 'Caren Hilger', 'Ahmed Magheli', 'Gertraud Stadler', 'Friederike Kendel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Mediation by illness perceptions of the effect of personality and health threat communication on coping with the diagnosis of diabetes.', 'Psychological factors influencing emotional reactions to gestational trophoblastic disease: The role of coping mechanisms and illness perception.', 'Predicting general and cancer-related distress in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer.', 'The common sense model of self-regulation: Meta-analysis and test of a process model.', 'Illness representations, coping, and illness outcomes in people with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

To date, models predicting progression on AS have invariably used traditional statistical approaches. We sought to evaluate whether a machine learning (ML) approach could improve prediction of progression on AS.  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with very-low or low-risk prostate cancer between 1997 and 2016 and managed with AS at our institution. In the training set, we trained a traditional logistic regression (T-LR) classifier, and alternate ML classifiers (support vector machine, random forest, a fully connected artificial neural network, and ML-LR) to predict grade-progression. We evaluated model performance in the test set. The primary performance metric was the F1 score.  Results:   Our cohort included 790 patients. With a median follow-up of 6.29 years, 234 developed grade-progression. In descending order, the F1 scores were: support vector machine 0.586 (95% CI 0.579 - 0.591), ML-LR 0.522 (95% CI 0.513 - 0.526), artificial neural network 0.392 (95% CI 0.379 - 0.396), random forest 0.376 (95% CI 0.364 - 0.380), and T-LR 0.182 (95% CI 0.151 - 0.185). All alternate ML models had a significantly higher F1 score than the T-LR model (all p <0.001).  Conclusion:   In our study, ML methods significantly outperformed T-LR in predicting progression on AS for prostate cancer.

In addition, 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA]) may also identify csPCa accurately.  Objective:   This trial aimed to determine whether the combination of PSMA + MRI was superior to MRI in diagnostic performance for detecting csPCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective multicentre phase II imaging trial was conducted. A total of 296 men were enrolled with suspected prostate cancer, with no prior biopsy or MRI, recent MRI (6 mo), and planned transperineal biopsy based on clinical risk and MRI. In all, 291 men underwent MRI, pelvic-only PSMA, and systematic ± targeted biopsy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values (negative predictive value [NPV] and positive predictive value) for csPCa were determined for MRI, PSMA, and PSMA + MRI. PSMA + MRI was defined as negative for PSMA negative Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 2/3 and positive for either MRI PI-RADS 4/5 or PSMA positive PI-RADS 2/3; csPCa was any International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group ≥2 malignancy.  Results and limitations:   Of the patients, 56% (n = 162) had csPCa; 67% had PI-RADS 3-5, 73% were PSMA positive, and 81% were combined PSMA + MRI positive. Combined PSMA + MRI improved NPV compared with MRI alone (91% vs 72%, test ratio = 1.27 [1.11-1.39], p < 0.001). Sensitivity also improved (97% vs 83%, p < 0.001); however, specificity was reduced (40% vs 53%, p = 0.011). Five csPCa cases were missed with PSMA + MRI (four ISUP 2 and one ISUP 3). Of all men, 19% (56/291) were PSMA + MRI negative (38% of PI-RADS 2/3) and could potentially have avoided biopsy, risking delayed csPCa detection in 3.1% men with csPCa (5/162) or 1.7% (5/291) overall.  Conclusions:   PSMA + MRI improved NPV and sensitivity for csPCa in an MRI triaged population. Further randomised studies will determine whether biopsy can safely be omitted in men with a high clinical suspicion of csPCa but negative combined imaging.

Among the common treatment options, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is being considered a promising local therapy to treat this cancer. Although PDT is an established treatment modality approved for several types of cancer, the low solubility, the reduced tumor selectivity, the absorption in the therapeutic window and the poor clearance from the body of the currently approved photosensitizers (PS) hampers its wide clinical application. In this regard, herein we synthesized three fluorinated porphyrinoid derivatives and entrapped them into polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to prevent their aggregation and preserve their desirable photophysical properties under the physiological environment. In vitro studies revealed the negligible dark cytotoxicity of all PVP formulations (PS1@PVP, PS2@PVP and PS3@PVP) at the tested concentrations (5.0 to 20 μM), but also confirmed the significant photodynamic effect of PS2@PVP and PS3@PVP towards the PCa cell line PC-3, upon red light irradiation at an irradiance of 17.6 mW.cm-2. To provide insight into the underlying mechanisms of cell death under PDT treatment induced by PS2@PVP and PS3@PVP, their intracellular localization in PC-3 cells was firstly investigated by confocal microscopy. Since both PS2@PVP and PS3@PVP nanoparticles were mainly localized in mitochondria, the involvement of this organelle in PDT-induced apoptosis mediated by both formulations was further explored. Western blot analysis revealed that PDT treatment of PC-3 cells with either PS2@PVP or PS3@PVP resulted in the reduction of the expression level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. As the photodamage to Bcl-2 after PDT with PS2@PVP and PS3@PVP was accompanied by the further activation of pro-caspase-3, we assumed that upon irradiation the photogenerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) were able to activate a caspase-dependent apoptotic response as a consequence of a post-mitochondrial event. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that among the tested fluorinated porphyrinoids, PS2@PVP and, particularly, PS3@PVP, are significantly more effective in overall PC-3 cell killing than PS1@PVP, thus highlighting their great potential as therapeutic agents for PCa.""","""['Mariana Q Mesquita', 'Ana Rita Ferreira', 'Maria da Graça P M S Neves', 'Daniela Ribeiro', 'Margarida Fardilha', 'Maria A F Faustino']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Photochem Photobiol B""","""['Photolon™ --photosensitization induces apoptosis via ROS-mediated cross-talk between mitochondria and lysosomes.', 'The potential application of chlorin e6-polyvinylpyrrolidone formulation in photodynamic therapy.', 'Lysosomal cathepsin initiates apoptosis, which is regulated by photodamage to Bcl-2 at mitochondria in photodynamic therapy using a novel photosensitizer, ATX-s10 (Na).', 'Role of Bcl-2 Family Proteins in Photodynamic Therapy Mediated Cell Survival and Regulation.', 'Cell death and growth arrest in response to photodynamic therapy with membrane-bound photosensitizers.', 'Comparing PVP and Polymeric Micellar Formulations of a PEGylated Photosensitizing Phthalocyanine by NMR and Optical Techniques.', 'Porphyrin Photosensitizers Grafted in Cellulose Supports: A Review.', 'An Analysis of the Effects of In Vitro Photodynamic Therapy on Prostate Cancer Tissue by Histopathological Examination and Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Photodynamic Therapy-Adjunctive Therapy in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although TMM pathways have traditionally been considered to be mutually exclusive, ALT hallmarks have been identified in cancers defined as being telomerase-positive, supporting TMM coexistence. In castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), in vitro models were thought to be universally dependent on telomerase as the primary TMM; however, CRPC models with androgen receptor (AR) loss demonstrate ALT hallmarks with limited telomerase activity and require ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) for sustained telomere maintenance. The TMM coexistence in AR-negative CRPC is reliant on the ALT regulator protein, SLX4IP.  Methods:   To identify the regions of SLX4IP responsible for the induction of APBs and telomere preservation in CRPC models, five 3xFLAG-tagged SLX4IP constructs were designed and stably introduced into parental C4-2B, DU145, and PC-3 cells. Once generated, these cell lines were interrogated for APB abundance and SLX4IP construct localization via immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF-FISH) and coimmunoprecipitation experiments for telomeric localization. Similarly, PC-3 cells with endogenous SLX4IP knockdown and SLX4IP construct introduction were interrogated for APB abundance, telomere length preservation, and senescent rescue.  Results:   Here, we define the N-terminus of SLX4IP as being responsible for the promotion of the ALT-like phenotype of AR-negative CRPC models. Specifically, the N-terminus of SLX4IP was sufficient for promoting APB formation to a similar degree as full-length SLX4IP across CRPC cell lines. Additionally, APB promotion by the N-terminus of SLX4IP rescued telomere shortening and senescent induction triggered by SLX4IP knockdown in AR-negative CRPC cells. Moreover, APB formation and telomere maintenance were dependent on the ability of the N-terminus to direct SLX4IP localization at telomeres and APBs.  Conclusions:   These findings identify the role of the uncharacterized ALT regulator SLX4IP in the promotion of TMM coexistence to perpetuate replicative immortality in CRPC in vitro.""","""['Tawna L Mangosh', 'Magdalena M Grabowska', 'Derek J Taylor']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['SLX4IP Promotes Telomere Maintenance in Androgen Receptor-Independent Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through ALT-like Telomeric PML Localization.', 'Telomere length heterogeneity in ALT cells is maintained by PML-dependent localization of the BTR complex to telomeres.', 'Telomere maintenance in Wilms tumors: first evidence for the presence of alternative lengthening of telomeres mechanism.', 'Telomere Length Maintenance in Cancer: At the Crossroad between Telomerase and Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT).', 'ALT: A Multi-Faceted Phenomenon.']"""

Herein, we evaluated the pathological roles of LATS2 in prostate cancer (PC), for which very little information is available.  Methods:   Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in response to the siRNA-mediated knockdown (KD) LATS2 expression were evaluated in two PC cell lines (LNCaP and PC3). The expression of LATS2 in specimens from 204 PC patients was investigated immunohistochemically, and the relationships between its expression and clinicopathological features, proliferation index (PI; measured using an anti-KI-67 antibody), and biochemical recurrence (BCR) were investigated.  Results:   KD of LATS2 increased the growth, migration, and invasion in LNCaP cells and only increased migration in PC3 cells. The expression of LATS2 was negatively associated with the grade group, T, N, M stage, and PI. In addition, the expression of LATS2 was a useful predictor of the histological effects of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy and BCR-free survival periods. A multivariate analysis model including clinicopathological features showed that negative expression of LATS2 had a significantly higher risk of BCR (odds ratio = 2.95, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   LATS2 acts as a tumor suppressor in PC. LATS2 expression is a useful predictor for BCR. LATS2-related activities are possibly dependent on the androgen-dependency of PC cells. Therefore, we suggest that LATS2 could be a potential therapeutic target and a useful predictor for outcome in patients with PC.""","""['Tsuyoshi Matsuda', 'Yasuyoshi Miyata', 'Yuichiro Nakamura', 'Asato Otsubo', 'Yuta Mukae', 'Junki Harada', 'Kensuke Mitsunari', 'Tomohiro Matsuo', 'Kojiro Ohba', 'Bungo Furusato', 'Hideki Sakai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['LATS2 as a poor prognostic marker regulates non-small cell lung cancer invasion by modulating MMPs expression.', 'miR-135b, upregulated in breast cancer, promotes cell growth and disrupts the cell cycle by regulating LATS2.', 'Identification of a tumor suppressor relay between the FOXP3 and the Hippo pathways in breast and prostate cancers.', 'WBP2 promotes gastric cancer cell migration via novel targeting of LATS2 kinase in the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway.', 'Downregulation of MiR-31 stimulates expression of LATS2 via the hippo pathway and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

We investigated the prevalence of financial assistance mechanisms used to alleviate out-of-pocket costs and the association of these mechanisms with timing of treatment initiation of abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Methods:   Using data from the medical center's specialty pharmacy, we identified first prescriptions for abiraterone or enzalutamide between January 1, 2017, and March 31, 2019. Prescriptions dispensed at an external pharmacy or that were discontinued for reasons unrelated to cost were excluded. Patient demographics, insurance coverage, out-of-pocket cost, and number of days between prescribed date and pill-to-mouth date were collected.  Results:   Among 220 prescriptions in our final cohort, 185 were filled through our internal specialty pharmacy, 23 through a manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance program (PAP), and 12 were never filled because of cost. One third of the prescriptions in our final cohort (n = 66) were filled with financial assistance: PAP (10%), copay cards (9%), and grants (11%). The median amount of assistance received for the first fill was $2,860 US dollars (USD) (interquartile range $1,856-$10,717 USD). Prescriptions with an out-of-pocket cost < $100 USD were filled in the shortest time (median 5 days), whereas those filled through a PAP had the longest time to initiation (median 30.5 days).

Patients and methods:   From January 2012 to February 2020, freehand TP prostate biopsy via angiocatheters or the PrecisionPoint Transperineal Access System was performed on consecutive men with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) or confirmed PCa. Biopsies were performed by a single urologist (developer of the PrecisionPoint system). Clinical data were collected retrospectively. Pre-procedural antibiotics were given to all patients up until 6 September 2016. After this date, antibiotics were omitted from those without risk factors (chronic catherization, concurrent endoscopic procedure, history of sepsis after transrectal [TR] biopsy, history of TR biopsy within the last year, prosthetic joints/heart valves). Patients were assessed 1 week after biopsy for symptoms, emergency department visits, and hospital admissions. Patients who received antimicrobial prophylaxis were compared with those who did not, and infectious complications were analysed. Additionally, oncological outcomes were reported.  Results:   A total of 988 biopsies (median prostate-specific antigen level 7.7 ng/mL) were included in the analysis on 756 patients. Prophylaxis was given in 538 of the biopsies (54.4%) and in 450 (48.6%) it was not. There was a statistical difference in median age (67 vs 69 years; P < 0.001), abnormal digital rectal examination (13% vs 5%; P < 0.001), and history of multiparametic magnetic resonance imaging (15% vs 31%; P < 0.001) between the prophylaxis and no-prophylaxis cohorts, respectively. There were no documented complications in those who received antibiotics. Within the no-prophylaxis cohort, there were three (0.66%) complications (P = 0.09). Two patients (0.44%) had urinary tract infections and one patient (0.22%) experienced post-procedural urinary retention. No patient required hospital admission or an emergency department visit. Clinically significant cancer was detected in 152 (40.0%) and 64 patients (39.0%) on initial biopsy and prior negative biopsy, respectively.

Although, mechanistic data suggest that consuming high-GI foods may contribute to carcinogenesis through elevated blood glucose levels, insulin resistance or obesity-related mechanisms. Our objective was to study the associations between dietary GI/GL and cancer.  Methods:   In total, 103 020 French adults (median age = 40.2 years) from the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2020) with no cancer or diabetes at baseline were included (705 137 person-years, median follow-up time = 7.7 years). Repeated 24-h dietary records linked with a detailed food-composition table (>3500 food/beverage items). We computed the average dietary GI and GL at the individual level. Associations between GI, GL, contribution of low- and medium/high-GI foods to energy and carbohydrate intake and cancer risk (overall, breast, prostate and colorectal) were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional-hazard models.  Results:   Higher dietary GL was associated with higher overall cancer risk [n = 3131 cases, hazard ratios (HRs) for sex-specific quintile 5 vs 1 = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.52; Ptrend = 0.008] and specifically postmenopausal breast cancer (n = 924, HRQ5vs.Q1 = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.06-2.55; Ptrend = 0.03). A higher contribution of low-GI food/beverages to energy intake was associated with lower cancer risk whereas a higher contribution of medium/high-GI items to energy intake was positively associated with higher risk of overall, breast and postmenopausal breast cancers (Ptrend ≤ 0.02).  Conclusions:   These results support a possible impact of GI/GL on cancer risk.

In medical practice, nested test-and-treat strategies are common to improve cost-effectiveness. For example, for patients at risk of prostate cancer, only patients who have high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) need a biopsy, which is costly and invasive, to confirm the diagnosis and help determine the treatment if needed. A decision about treatment happens after the biopsy, and is thus nested within the decision of whether to do the test. However, current existing statistical methods are not able to accommodate such a naturally embedded property of the treatment decision within the test decision. Therefore, we developed a new statistical learning method, step-adjusted tree-based reinforcement learning, to evaluate DTRs within such a nested multistage dynamic decision framework using observational data. At each step within each stage, we combined the robust semiparametric estimation via augmented inverse probability weighting with a tree-based reinforcement learning method to deal with the counterfactual optimization. The simulation studies demonstrated robust performance of the proposed methods under different scenarios.

Methods: Three VMAT plans were retrospectively created for 20 patients: (1) partial arcs (PA), (2) 2 full arcs optimized with 500 cGy max prostheses dose (MD), and (3) 2 full arcs optimized with max dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraint of 500 cGy to 10% prostheses volume (MDVH). PA techniques contained 6 PA with beam angles that avoid entering each prosthesis. For each patient, other than prostheses constraints, the same Pinnacle VMAT optimization objectives were used. Plans were normalized with PTV D95% = 79.2 Gy prescription dose. Organ-at-risk DVH metrics, monitor units (MUs), conformality, gradient, and homogeneity indices were evaluated for each plan. Mean entrance prosthesis dose was determined in Pinnacle by converting each arc into static beams and utilizing only control points traversing each prosthesis. Plan deliverability was evaluated with SunNuclear ArcCheck measurements (gamma criteria 3%/2 mm) on an Elekta machine. Results: MD and MDVH had similar dosimetric quality, both improved DVH metrics for rectum and bladder compared to PA. Plan complexities among all plans were similar (average MUs: 441-518). Conformality, homogeneity, and gradient indices were significantly improved in MD and MDVH versus PA (P < .001). Gamma pass rates for MD (99.0 ± 1.2%) and MDVH (99.2 ± 0.99%) were comparable. A significant difference over PA was observed (96.8 ± 1.6%, P < .001). Field-by-field analysis demonstrated 12/20 PA plans resulted in fields with pass rates <95% versus 1/20 plans for MD and none for MDVH. Cumulative mean entrance doses to each prosthesis were 62.9 ± 17.7 cGy for MD plans and 83.4 ± 27.5 cGy for MDVH plans.

However, the ability of geometric indices to identify the error of contouring results is limited primarily because they do not consider the clinical background. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between geometric and clinical dosimetric indices.  Methods:   Four different types of targets were selected (C-shaped target, oropharyngeal cancer, metastatic spine cancer, and prostate cancer), and the translation, scaling, rotation, and sine function transformation were performed with the software Python to introduce systematic and random errors. The transformed contours were regarded as reference contours. Dosimetric indices were obtained from the original dose distribution of the radiotherapy plan. The correlations between geometric and dosimetric indices were quantified by linear regression.  Results:   The correlations between the geometric and dosimetric indices were inconsistent. For systematic errors, and with the exception of the sine function transformation (R2: 0.023-0.04, P > 0.05), the geometric transformations of the C-shaped target were correlated with the D98% and Dmean (R2: 0.689-0.988), 80% of which were P < 0.001. For the random errors, the correlations obtained by the all targets were R2 > 0.384, P < 0.05. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the spatial direction resolution capability of geometric indices in different directions of the C-shaped target (with systematic errors), and the results showed only the volumetric geometric indices with P < 0.05.  Conclusions:   Clinically, an assessment of the contour accuracy of the region-of-interest is not feasible based on geometric indices alone. Dosimetric indices should be added to the evaluations of the accuracy of the delineation results, which can be helpful for explaining the clinical dose response relationship of delineation more comprehensively and accurately.""","""['Lixun Xian', 'Guangjun Li', 'Qing Xiao', 'Zhibin Li', 'Xiangbin Zhang', 'Li Chen', 'Zhenyao Hu', 'Sen Bai']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Clinically Oriented Contour Evaluation Using Dosimetric Indices Generated From Automated Knowledge-Based Planning.', 'Set-up error and dosimetric analysis of HexaPOD evo RT 6D couch combined with cone beam CT image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for primary malignant tumor of the cervical spine.', 'Dosimetric adaptive IMRT driven by fiducial points.', 'Current State of Image Guidance in Radiation Oncology: Implications for PTV Margin Expansion and Adaptive Therapy.', 'Imaging for Target Delineation and Treatment Planning in Radiation Oncology: Current and Emerging Techniques.', 'Geometric and dosimetric evaluation of deep learning based auto-segmentation for clinical target volume on breast cancer.']"""

Methods:   Data were retrieved from the tumor Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and GSE46602 database for performing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) cox regression model analysis. Immune related genes (IRGs) data were retrieved from ImmPort database.  Results:   The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) showed that nine functional modules are correlated with the biochemical recurrence of PCa, including 259 IRGs. Univariate regression analysis and survival analysis identified 35 IRGs correlated with the prognosis of PCa. LASSO Cox regression model analysis was used to construct a risk prognosis model comprising 18 IRGs. Multivariate regression analysis showed that risk score was an independent predictor of the prognosis of PCa. A nomogram comprising a combination of this model and other clinical features showed good prediction accuracy in predicting the prognosis of PCa. Further analysis showed that different risk groups harbored different gene mutations, differential transcriptome expression and different immune infiltration levels. Patients in the high-risk group exhibited more gene mutations compared with those in the low-risk group. Patients in the high-risk groups showed high-frequency mutations in TP53. Immune infiltration analysis showed that M2 macrophages were significantly enriched in the high-risk group implying that it affected prognosis of PCa patients. In addition, immunostimulatory genes were differentially expressed in the high-risk group compared with the low-risk group. BIRC5, as an immune-related gene in the prediction model, was up-regulated in 87.5% of prostate cancer tissues. Knockdown of BIRC5 can inhibit cell proliferation and migration.  Conclusion:   In summary, a risk prognosis model based on IGRs was developed.

The protein is most concentrated in tears and produced by lacrimal glands. Tear lipocalin is also produced in the tongue, pituitary, prostate, and the tracheobronchial tree. Tear lipocalin has been assigned a multitude of functions. The functions of tear lipocalin are inexorably linked to structural characteristics that are often shared by the lipocalin family. These characteristics result in the binding and or transport of a wide range of small hydrophobic molecules. The cavity of tear lipocalin is formed by eight strands (A-H) that are arranged in a β-barrel and are joined by loops between the β-strands. Recently, studies of the solution structure of tear lipocalin have unveiled new structural features such as cation-π interactions, which are extant throughout the lipocalin family. Lipocalin has many unique features that affect ligand specificity. These include a capacious and a flexible cavity with mobile and short overhanging loops. Specific features that confer promiscuity for ligand binding in tear lipocalin will be analyzed. The functions of tear lipocalin include the following: antimicrobial activities, scavenger of toxic and tear disruptive compounds, endonuclease activity, and inhibition of cysteine proteases. In addition, tear lipocalin binds and may modulate lipids in the tears. Such actions support roles as an acceptor for phospholipid transfer protein, heteropolymer formation to alter viscosity, and tear surface interactions. The promiscuous lipid-binding properties of tear lipocalin have created opportunities for its use as a drug carrier. Mutant analogs have been created to bind other molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor for medicinal use. Tear lipocalin has been touted as a useful biomarker for several diseases including breast cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetic retinopathy, and keratoconus. The functional possibilities of tear lipocalin dramatically expanded when a putative receptor, lipocalin-interacting membrane receptor was identified. However, opposing studies claim that lipocalin-interacting membrane receptor is not specific for lipocalin. A recent study even suggests a different function for the membrane protein. This controversy will be reviewed in light of gene expression data, which suggest that tear lipocalin has a different tissue distribution than the putative receptor. But the data show lipocalin-interacting membrane receptor is expressed on ocular surface epithelium and that a receptor function here would be rational.""","""['Ben J Glasgow']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Physiol""","""[""Tissue expression of lipocalins in human lacrimal and von Ebner's glands: colocalization with lysozyme."", 'Tear lipocalin: structure and function.', 'Human tear lipocalin.', 'Lipocalin-1 is the acceptor protein for phospholipid transfer protein in tears.', 'Resolution of ligand positions by site-directed tryptophan fluorescence in tear lipocalin.', ""An odorant-binding protein in the elephant's trunk is finely tuned to sex pheromone (Z)-7-dodecenyl acetate."", 'Mammalian derived lipocalin and secretoglobin respiratory allergens strongly bind ligands with potentially immune modulating properties.', 'Inhalant Mammal-Derived Lipocalin Allergens and the Innate Immunity.']"""

Here we investigated such a phenomenon in prostate cancer, in which tumours can escape epithelial lineage confinement and transition to a high-plasticity state as an adaptive response to potent androgen receptor (AR) antagonism. We found that AR activity can be maintained as tumours adopt alternative lineage identities, with changes in chromatin architecture guiding AR transcriptional rerouting.

In doing so, we identify pre-existing and treatment-persistent cell subpopulations that possess regenerative potential when subjected to treatment. We find distinct chromatin landscapes associated with enzalutamide treatment and resistance that are linked to alternative transcriptional programs. Transcriptional profiles characteristic of persistent cells are able to stratify the treatment response of patients. Ultimately, we show that defining changes in chromatin and gene expression in single-cell populations from pre-clinical models can reveal as yet unrecognized molecular predictors of treatment response.

Evaluation of long-term patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is important to confirm safety and enhance patient information.  Objective:   To determine whether 5-yr PROs from the CHHiP quality of life (QoL) substudy confirm 2-yr findings and assess patterns over follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase III randomised controlled trial recruited from 2002 to 2011. The QoL substudy completed accrual in 2009; participants were followed up to 5 yr after radiotherapy. Analyses used data snapshot taken on August 26, 2016. A total of 71 radiotherapy centres were included in the study (UK, Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, and New Zealand); all 57 UK centres participated in the QoL substudy. CHHiP recruited 3216 men with localised prostate cancer (cT1b-T3aN0M0).  Intervention:   Conventional (74 Gy/37 fractions/7.4 wk) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (60 Gy/20 fractions/4 wk or 57 Gy/19 fractions/3.8 wk) was delivered with intensity-modulated techniques.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   University of California Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index, Short Form 36 and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, or Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and Short Form 12 questionnaires were administered at baseline, before radiotherapy, at 10 wk, and at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60 mo after radiotherapy. The QoL primary endpoint was overall bowel bother.  Results and limitations:   The QoL substudy recruited 2100 patients; 1141 5-yr forms were available from 1957 patients still alive (58%). There were no statistically significant differences in 5-yr prevalence of overall ""moderate or big"" bowel bother: 19/349 (5.4%), 29/381 (7.6%), and 21/393 (5.3%) for 74, 60, and 57 Gy, respectively; overall urinary or sexual bother at 5 yr was similar between schedules. Bowel and urinary symptoms remained stable from 2 to 5 yr for all schedules. Some evidence of worsening overall sexual bother from baseline to 5 yr was less likely in the hypofractionated schedules compared with 74 Gy (odds ratios for increase in bother score vs 74 Gy: 0.55 [0.30-0.99], p = 0.009 for 60 Gy, and 0.52 [0.29-0.94], p = 0.004 for 57 Gy). General QoL scores were similar between schedules at 5 yr.  Conclusions:   Longer follow-up confirms earlier findings, with similar patient-reported bowel, urinary, and sexual problems between schedules overall. The continued low incidence of moderate or high bother confirms that moderate hypofractionation should be the standard of care for intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   We looked at patient-reported outcomes up to 5 yr after treatment in a trial of different radiotherapy schedules for prostate cancer. The findings confirmed that shorter radiotherapy schedules were as safe as standard radiotherapy in terms of bowel, urinary, and sexual problems.

However, the potential anti-tumour effects of T-96 against human Prostate cancer (CaP) cells and the possible underlying mechanisms have not been well studied.  Results:   In the current study, T-96 exerted significant cytotoxicity to CaP cells in vitro and induced cell cycle arrest at S-phase in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, T-96 promoted the initiation of autophagy but inhibited autophagic flux by inducing ROS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress which subsequently activated the extrinsic apoptosis pathway in CaP cells. These findings implied that T-96-induced ER stress activated the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway to inhibit proliferation of CaP cells. Moreover, we observed that T-96 enhances the sensitivity of CaP cells to the chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin.

Individualized treatments, based on adsorbed dose (AD) in target and non-target tissue, are absolutely needed to optimize efficacy while reducing toxicity of α-emitter targeted therapy. This is a pilot first in human clinical trial aimed to correlate dosimetry, clinical response and biological side effects to personalize 223Ra treatment.  Methods:   Out of 20 mCRPC patients who underwent standard 223Ra treatment and dosimetry, in a subset of 5 patients the AD to target and non-target tissues was correlated with clinical effects and radiation-induced chromosome damages. Before each 223Ra administrations, haematological parameters, PSA and ALP values were evaluated. Additional blood samples were obtained baseline (T0), at 7 days (T7), 30 days (T30) and 180 days (T180) to evaluate chromosome damage. After administration WB planar 223Ra images were obtained at 2-4 and 18-24 h. Treatment response and toxicity were monitored with clinical evaluation, bone scan, 18F-choline-PET/CT, PSA value and ALP while haematological parameters were evaluated weekly after 223Ra injection and 2 months after last cycle.  Results:   1. a correlation between AD to target and clinical response was evidenced with threshold of 20 Gy as a cut-off to obtain tumor control; 2. the AD to red marrow was lower than 2 Gy in all the patients with no apparently correlation between dosimetry and clinical toxicity. 3. a high dose dependent increase of the number of dicentrics and micronuclei during the course of 223Ra therapy was observed and a linear correlation has been found between blood AD (BAD) and number of dicentrics.  Conclusions:   This study provides some interesting preliminary evidence to be further investigated: dosimetry may be useful to identify a more appropriate 223Ra administered activity predicting AD to target tissue; a dose dependent complex chromosome damage occurs during 223Ra administration and this injury is more evident in heavily pre-treated patients; dosimetry could be used for radioprotection purpose.

Objectives:   The aim of this research was to survey the protective effect of FBX against irradiation (IR)-induced testis damage via the attenuation of oxidative stress.  Methods:   Male adult mice were randomly assigned into eight groups: control, FBX with three doses of 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg, IR with 6 Gy, IR + FBX (IR + FBX in three doses), respectively. In the IR + FBX groups, FBX was administrated for 8 consecutive days, and then mice were exposed to IR at a dose of 6 Gy on the 9th day. One day after irradiation, biochemical parameters were evaluated in the testis of animals, while histopathological assessment had been performed on 14th day.  Results:   Irradiation led to the induction of testicular toxicity. FBX significantly protected histopathological alterations and decreased oxidative stress parameters in irradiated testis. Besides, FBX increased the diameter and germinal epithelial thickness of seminiferous tubules and Johnson's score in irradiated mice.

Similarly, Centipeda minima (CM) is a well-known traditional Chinese medicine that has been used to treat rhinitis, relieve pain and reduce swelling, and recently found to exert overwhelming anti-tumor effects against breast cancer, colon cancer, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma with different response rates. However, what is the optimizing cancer model that benefits most from CM, and what is the specific target underlying still require more exclusive and profound investigations.  Aims of the study:   This study aimed to explore the dominant tumor model and specific target of CM by integrative pharmacology and biological experiments.  Materials and methods:   The most predominant and specific cancer types that are sensitive to CM were screened and identified based on a combination network pharmacology and bioinformatics analysis. Compound-target network and protein-protein interaction of CM-related cancer targets were carried out to determine the most abundant active compound. Simultaneously, the priority target responsible for CM-related anti-tumor efficacy was further validated by molecular docking and in vitro experiments.  Results:   In total, approximately 42% (8/19) of the targets were enriched in prostate cancer (p = 1.25E-09), suggesting prostate cancer would be the most sensitive tumor response to CM-related efficacy. Furthermore, we found that arnicolide D (ARD), the most abundant and representative active compound of CM, could directly bind to Src with binding energy of -7.3 kcal/mol, implying Src would be the priority target responsible for CM-related anti-tumor efficacy. Meanwhile, the results were further validated by solvent-induced protein precipitation (SIP) assay. In addition, PCR and WB results also revealed that either CM or ARD could not influence the gene expression of Src, while significantly decreased its protein expression instead, which further suggested that ARD might markedly shortene the Src protein half-life to promote Src protein degradation, thereby achieving significant anti-prostate cancer efficacy.

However, due to practice variation and an absence of comparative trials, no consensus exists on preference for brachytherapy (BT) or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). We compared these modalities in terms of disease control, nose preservation rates and toxicity.  Materials and methods:   Medical records of 225 patients with T1-T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule treated with 3D image-guided primary radiotherapy between Jan 2010 and Dec 2016 in 6 Dutch institutions were reviewed retrospectively.  Results:   153 of 225 patients were treated with BT, 65 with EBRT and 7 with other modalities. Median follow-up was 46 months. Overall 3-year local control (LC) and regional control (RC) were 87% and 89%. Five-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were 94% and 82%. Three-year survival with preserved nose (SPN) was 76%. BT provided higher 3-year LC (95% vs 71%, p < 0.01) and SPN compared with EBRT (82% vs 61%, p < 0.01). Multivariable and propensity-score-matched cohort analyses confirmed better outcomes after BT. No difference was seen in DSS or OS. Five-year incidence of CTCAE 5.0 grade ≥2 toxicity was higher after BT (20% vs 3%, p = 0.03) and consisted mostly of radiation ulcers. 50% of all late toxicity recovered.

We estimated the impact of delayed diagnosis on cancer outcomes in Chile using a novel modelling approach to inform policies and planning to mitigate the forthcoming cancer-related health impacts of the pandemic in Chile.  Methods:   We developed a microsimulation model of five cancers in Chile (breast, cervix, colorectal, prostate, and stomach) for which reliable data were available, which simulates cancer incidence and progression in a nationally representative virtual population, as well as stage-specific cancer detection and survival probabilities. We calibrated the model to empirical data on monthly detected cases, as well as stage at diagnosis and 5-year net survival. We accounted for the impact of COVID-19 on excess mortality and cancer detection by month during the pandemic, and projected diagnosed cancer cases and outcomes of stage at diagnosis and survival up to 2030. For comparison, we simulated a no COVID-19 scenario in which the impacts of COVID-19 on excess mortality and cancer detection were removed.  Findings:   Our modelling showed a sharp decrease in the number of diagnosed cancer cases during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a large projected short-term increase in future diagnosed cases. Due to the projected backlog in diagnosis, we estimated that in 2021 there will be an extra 3198 cases (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 1356-5017) diagnosed among the five modelled cancers, an increase of nearly 14% compared with the no COVID-19 scenario, falling to a projected 10% increase in 2022 with 2674 extra cases (1318-4032) diagnosed. As a result of delayed diagnosis, we found a worse stage distribution for detected cancers in 2020-22, which is estimated to lead to 3542 excess cancer deaths (95% UI 2236-4816) in 2022-30, compared with the no COVID-19 scenario, among the five modelled cancers, most of which (3299 deaths, 2151-4431) are projected to occur before 2025.  Interpretation:   In addition to a large projected surge in diagnosed cancer cases, we found that delays in diagnosis will result in worse cancer stage at presentation, leading to worse survival outcomes. These findings can help to inform surge capacity planning and highlight the importance of ensuring appropriate health system capacity levels to detect and care for the increased cancer cases in the coming years, while maintaining the timeliness and quality of cancer care. Potential delays in treatment and adverse impacts on quality of care, which were not considered in this model, are likely to contribute to even more excess deaths from cancer than projected.

The molecular mechanisms driving prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastasis (BM) are incompletely understood, and targetable genetic alterations are lacking in the majority of cases. Therefore, we aimed to explore the expression and potential functional relevance of 71 TRIM members in bone metastatic PCa. We performed transcriptome analysis of all human TRIM family members and 770 cancer-related genes in 29 localized PCa and 30 PCa BM using Nanostring. KEGG, STRING and Ubibrowser were used for further bioinformatic gene correlation and pathway enrichment analyses. Compared to localized tumors, six TRIMs are under-expressed while nine TRIMs are over-expressed in BM. The differentially expressed TRIM proteins are linked to TNF-, TGFβ-, PI3K/AKT- and HIF-1-signaling, and to features such as proteoglycans, platelet activation, adhesion and ECM-interaction based on correlation to cancer-related genes. The identification of TRIM-specific E3-ligase-substrates revealed insight into functional connections to oncogenes, tumor suppressors and cancer-related pathways including androgen receptor- and TGFβ signaling, cell cycle regulation and splicing. In summary, this is the first study that comprehensively and systematically characterizes the expression of all TRIM members in PCa BM.

Depending on the stage of disease, tumors can relapse in approximately 50% of patients with prostate cancer after radiotherapy. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that drive tumor cell survival are not fully characterized, and reliable molecular prognostic markers of prostate cancer radioresistance are missing. Similar to other tumor entities, prostate cancer cells are heterogeneous in their capability to maintain tumor growth. The populations of cancer stem cells (CSCs) with self-renewal and differentiation properties are responsible for tumor development and recurrence after treatment. Eradication of these CSC populations is of utmost importance for efficient tumor cure. In a recently published study, we showed that prostate cancer cells could be radiosensitized by glutamine deprivation, resulting in DNA damage, oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and depletion of CSCs. Conversely, prostate cancer cells with resistance to glutamine depletion show an activation of ATG-mediated macroautophagy/autophagy as a survival strategy to withstand radiation-induced damage. Thus, a combination of targeting glutamine metabolism and autophagy blockade lead to more efficient prostate cancer radiosensitization.Abbreviations: ATG5: autophagy related 5; CSCs: cancer stem cells; GLS: glutaminase; TCA cycle: tricarboxylic acid cycle.""","""['Anna Mukha', 'Uğur Kahya', 'Anna Dubrovska']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['GLS-driven glutamine catabolism contributes to prostate cancer radiosensitivity by regulating the redox state, stemness and ATG5-mediated autophagy.', 'Interplay between MycN and c-Myc regulates radioresistance and cancer stem cell phenotype in neuroblastoma upon glutamine deprivation.', 'Glutamine deficiency promotes stemness and chemoresistance in tumor cells through DRP1-induced mitochondrial fragmentation.', 'Therapeutic Targeting of Glutaminolysis as a Novel Strategy to Combat Cancer Stem Cells.', 'Cancer stem cells in prostate cancer radioresistance.', 'Ketoglutaric acid can reprogram the immunophenotype of triple-negative breast cancer after radiotherapy and improve the therapeutic effect of anti-PD-L1.', 'Crosstalk between autophagy and CSCs: molecular mechanisms and translational implications.', 'Stromal cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhance radioresistance of prostate cancer cells via interleukin-8-induced autophagy.', 'Integrating multiple machine learning methods to construct glutamine metabolism-related signatures in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'A metabolic shift toward glycolysis enables cancer cells to maintain survival upon concomitant glutamine deprivation and V-ATPase inhibition.']"""

TERF1 is a gene essential to telomere maintenance, and its dysfunction has already been associates with several cancers. TERF1 is a target of miR-155, and this microRNA can inhibit its expression and promotes carcinogenesis in breast cancer. We aim to analyze TERF1, in gene and mRNA level, involvement in prostate cancer progression.  Results:   Alterations in TERF1 DNA were evaluated using datasets of primary tumor and castration-resistant tumors (CRPC) deposited in cBioportal. The expression of TERF1 mRNA levels was assessed utilizing TCGA datasets, clinical specimens, and metastatic prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, and PC3). Six percent of localized prostate cancer presents alterations in TERF1 (the majority of that was amplifications). In the CRPC cohort, 26% of samples had TERF1 amplification. Patients with TERF1 alterations had the worst overall survival only on localized cancer cohort (p = 0.0027). In the TCGA cohort, mRNA levels of TERF1 were downregulated in comparison with normal tissue (p = 0.0013) and upregulated in tumors that invade lymph nodes (p = 0.0059). The upregulation of TERF1 is also associated with worst overall survival (p = 0.0028) and disease-free survival (p = 0.0023). There is a positive correlation between TERF1 and androgen receptor expression in cancer tissue (r = 0.53, p < 0.00001) but not on normal tissue (r = - 0.16, p = 0.12). In the clinical specimens, there is no detectable expression of TERF1 and upregulation of miR-155 (p = 0.0348). In cell lines, TERF1 expression was higher in LNCaP and was progressively lower in DU145 and PC3 (p = 0.0327) with no differences in miR-155 expression.

Personalized cancer vaccines developed based on neoantigens have shown promising results by prolonging cancer patients' overall survival (OS) for several cancer types. However, the safety and efficacy of these vaccine modalities remains unclear in pancreatic cancer patients.  Methods:   This retrospective study enrolled 7 advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Up to 20 neoantigen peptides per patient identified by our in-house pipeline iNeo-Suite were selected, manufactured and administered to these patients with low tumor mutation burden (TMB) (less than 10 mutations/Mb). Each patient received multiple doses of vaccine depending on the progression of the disease. Peripheral blood samples of each patient were collected pre- and post-vaccination for the analysis of the immunogenicity of iNeo-Vac-P01 through ELISpot assay and flow cytometry.  Results:   No severe vaccine-related adverse effects were witnessed in patients enrolled in this study. The mean OS, OS associated with vaccine treatment and progression free survival (PFS) were reported to be 24.1, 8.3 and 3.1 months, respectively. Higher peripheral IFN-γ titer and CD4+ or CD8+ effector memory T cells count post vaccination were found in patients with relatively long overall survival. Remarkably, for patient P01 who had a 21-month OS associated with vaccine treatment, the abundance of antigen-specific TCR clone drastically increased from 0% to nearly 100%, indicating the potential of iNeo-Vac-P01 in inducing the activation of a specific subset of T cells to kill cancer cells.

Performing prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) before prostate biopsy can increase the probability to detect aggressive prostate cancer while decreasing the probability to detect indolent prostate cancer, thereby assisting in the selection of patients before the biopsy. The Israel Basket of Health Services does not include prostate mpMRI prior to the first prostate biopsy. Our objective was to examine the significance of performing mpMRI before prostate biopsy.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the demographic, clinical, and pathological data from men who underwent transrectal biopsy of the prostate in the last 30 months in our institute. In all men with suspicious findings on mpMRI, targeted biopsies were taken in addition to systematic biopsies. We considered cancer as clinically significant if the Gleason sum was 7 or above. Fisher's Exact test was performed for categorical variables and student t-test for continuous variables.  Results:   Five hundred and sixteen men underwent prostate biopsy; 163(32%) performed prostate mpMRI before the biopsy; 101(25%) performed mpMRI before the first prostate biopsy and 62(59%) before the second or more prostate biopsies. Prostate cancer was detected in 46% of all men (61% in men after mpMRI versus 38% in men without, p<0.0001). In men for whom this was the first prostate biopsy, prostate cancer was detected in 47% (73% in men after mpMRI versus 39% in men without, p<0.0001); and after second or more biopsies 38% (42% in men after mpMRI versus 33% in men without, p=0.4147). Also, there was a statistically significant difference in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer with mpMRI versus without.  Conclusions:   Performing prostate mpMRI before prostate biopsy significantly increases the detection rate of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer. It should be recommended to perform mpMRI before any prostate biopsy in accordance with the European and American Urology Association, and NCCN guidelines.""","""['David Dothan', 'Ariel Mamber', 'Ilan Kafka', 'Ala Eddin Natsheh', 'Ofer Shenfeld', 'Sofia Zilber', 'Ofer Benyaminov', 'Boris Chertin', 'Dmitry Koulikov']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Harefuah""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Clinical Utility of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging as the First-line Tool for Men with High Clinical Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

In spite of recurrent screening, vaccination, and chemotherapeutic interventions, combating cervical cancer still remains a challenge. Crizotinib is a small molecule inhibitor that targets mesenchymal epithelial transition factor (c-MET) and has been successfully studied for its anti-cancer effects in non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, gastric, renal, prostate, and breast carcinomas. Although c-MET is a well-known prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic target in cervical cancer, anti-cancer properties of its inhibitor crizotinib against cervical carcinoma, has not been explored yet.  Methods:   In the present study, the anti-cancer effects of crizotinib on cervical cancer cells were evaluated using various in vitro cell-based assays, such as labelling drug-treated cells with MTT, H2 DCFDA, Annexin V5-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) antibody, JC-1, PI, and analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  Results:   The molecule was found to effectively inhibit proliferation of cervical cancer cells HeLa and SiHa with an IC50 of 0.641 ± 0.0724 and 0.871 ± 0.104 μM, respectively, and induce apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Further investigations showed that crizotinib-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with increasing concentrations further resulted in mitochondrial membrane depolarization. However, the drug had no effect on cell cycle progression of HeLa and SiHa cells.  Conclusion:   Thus, the study elucidates the cytotoxic effects of crizotinib in cervical cancer cells by activation of ROS-dependent apoptotic pathway via mitochondrial depolarization. These findings will further aid the evaluation of other molecular mechanisms of crizotinib and would pave the way for its implication as a chemotherapeutic option in cervical cancer.""","""['Diksha A Varma', 'Manisha Tiwari']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Obstet Gynaecol Res""","""['Tiliacora racemosa leaves induce oxidative stress mediated DNA damage leading to G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis in cervical cancer cells SiHa.', 'Carvacrol Exhibits Chemopreventive Potential against Cervical Cancer Cells via Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis and Abrogation of Cell Cycle Progression.', 'Suppressing effects of green tea extract and Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) on TGF-β- induced Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via ROS/Smad signaling in human cervical cancer cells.', '(S)-crizotinib induces apoptosis in human non-small cell lung cancer cells by activating ROS independent of MTH1.', 'Nujiangexathone A, a Novel Compound Derived from Garcinia nujiangensis, Induces Caspase-Dependent Apoptosis in Cervical Cancer through the ROS/JNK Pathway.', 'A novel necroptosis-related lncRNA based signature predicts prognosis and response to treatment in cervical cancer.']"""

Caspase-8 expression is often lost in some tumors, but increased in others, indicating a potential pro-survival function in cancer. By analyzing transcriptome of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells, we found that resistance was conferred by a mild caspase-8 upregulation that in turn led to NF-κB activation and the subsequent upregulation of the downstream IL-8. Mechanistically, we found that the pro-survival and enzalutamide-resistance-promoting features of caspase-8 were independent of its proteolytic activity, using a catalytically-inactive caspase-8 mutant. We further demonstrated that caspase-8 pro-apoptotic function was inhibited via cFLIP binding. Moreover, high caspase-8 expression was correlated with a worse prognosis in prostate cancer patients. Collectively, our work demonstrates that enzalutamide-resistance is mediated by caspase-8 upregulation and the consequent increase in NF-κB/IL-8 mediated survival signaling, highlighting caspase-8 and NF-κB as potential therapeutic targets to overcome enzalutamide-resistance in CRPC.""","""['Jia Xia#', 'Jiahui Zhang#', 'Liangzhe Wang#', 'Hailong Liu', 'Jie Wang', 'Junyan Liu', 'Zhaoqian Liu', 'Yingjian Zhu', 'Yingjie Xu', 'Wen Yang', 'Yongjiang Yu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Upregulation of ATP Binding Cassette Subfamily C Member 5 facilitates Prostate Cancer progression and Enzalutamide resistance via the CDK1-mediated AR Ser81 Phosphorylation Pathway.', 'IAP Antagonists Enhance Apoptotic Response to Enzalutamide in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells via Autocrine TNF-α Signaling.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate tumor growth and progression through upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis.', 'RIP1 Cleavage in the Kinase Domain Regulates TRAIL-Induced NF-κB Activation and Lymphoma Survival.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Apoptotic proteins with non-apoptotic activity: expression and function in cancer.', 'Enzalutamide Induces Apoptotic Insults to Human Drug-Resistant and -Sensitive Glioblastoma Cells via an Intrinsic Bax-Mitochondrion-Cytochrome C Caspase Cascade Activation Pathway.', 'The Novel Protein ADAMTS16 Promotes Gastric Carcinogenesis by Targeting IFI27 through the NF-κb Signaling Pathway.']"""

Methods:   Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to detect miR-199b-3p expression in PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue samples. In addition, we examined the relationship between the poor prognosis in PCa and miR-199b-3p. Western blot was used to analyze the expression of Phospholipase Cε (PLCε). CCK8 and colony-forming assays were applied to detect the proliferation of PCa. EdU assay is used to detect PCa cells uptake of EdU. Luciferase reporter assay was applied to analyze the binding between miR-199b-3p and PLCε.  Results:   It has been shown that miR-199b-3p in PCa was significantly lower than that in benign prostatic hyperplasia and correlated with poor prognosis. Meanwhile, upregulation of miR-199b-3p can prominently inhibit the proliferation of PCa cells, while its down-regulation triggered opposite result.

Currently, where feasible, this is conducted manually, which is time consuming and resource intensive. Although previous studies mostly focused on automating delineation QA on CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being increasingly used in radiotherapy treatment. In this work, we propose to perform automatic delineation QA on prostate MRI for both the clinical target volume (CTV) and organs-at-risk (OARs) by using delineations generated by 3D Unet variants as benchmarks for QA. These networks were trained on a small gold standard atlas set and applied on a multicentre radiotherapy clinical trial dataset to generate benchmark delineations. Then, a QA stage was designed to recommend 'pass', 'minor correction' and 'major correction' for each manual delineation in the trial set by thresholding its Dice similarity coefficient to the network generated delineation. Among all 3D Unet variants explored, the Unet with anatomical gates in an AtlasNet architecture performed the best in delineation QA, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.97, 0.92, 0.89 and 0.97 for identifying unacceptable (major correction) delineations with a sensitivity of 0.93, 0.73, 0.74 and 0.90 at a specificity of 0.93, 0.86, 0.86 and 0.95 for bladder, prostate CTV, rectum and gel spacer respectively.

Methods:   Tissue microarrays were constructed from 132 patients with prostate cancer from the Irish Prostate Cancer Research Consortium and University Hospital of Orebro, Sweden.

The dosimetric quality of the plans was evaluated using dosimetric parameters and dose indices that account for target coverage and sparing of the organs at risk (OARs). We defined the rectum, bladder, and bilateral femoral heads. The VMAT-MCO plan offers an improvement of gross treatment volume coverage with increased minimal dose and reduced maximal dose. In the planning treatment volume, the Dmean and better gradient, homogeneity, and conformity indexes improved despite the increasing hot and cold spots. When implemented through the MCO plan, a steeper fall off the adjacent OARs in the overlap area was achieved to obtain lower dose parameters. MCO generated better sparing of the rectum and bladder through a tradeoff of the increasing dose to the bilateral femoral heads within the tolerable dose constraints. Compared with re-optimization and re-calculation, respectively, significant dose reductions were observed in the bladder (241 cGy and 254 cGy; p<0.001) and rectum (474 cGy and 604 cGy, p<0.001) with the MCO. Planning evaluation and dosimetric measurements showed that the VMAT-MCO plan using visualized navigation can provide sparing of OAR doses without compromising the target coverage in the same OAR dose constraints.""","""['Jongmoo Park', 'Jaehyeon Park', 'Sean Oh', 'Ji Woon Yea', 'Jeong Eun Lee', 'Jae Won Park']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning using multicriteria optimization for localized prostate cancer.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.', 'VMAT partial arc technique decreases dose to organs at risk in whole pelvic radiotherapy for prostate cancer when compared to full arc VMAT and IMRT.', 'Comparison of volumetric-modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy prostate cancer plans accounting for cold spots.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.', 'ICON-P - A double-blind evaluation of quality improvements with individualized CONstraints from low-cost knowledge-based radiation therapy planning in prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we compared the clinical outcomes of two different salvage treatments, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone versus ADT with radiotherapy (RT). We also investigated prognostic factors that could support the use of ADT with RT in LNP prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed 94 LNP prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) followed by salvage treatment between 2004 and 2018. Salvage treatments involved either ADT alone or ADT with RT according to the clinical judgment of the physician. We analyzed clinicopathological and treatment factors related to 2nd biochemical failure (2nd BCF), clinical progression (CP), and progression-free survival (PFS). The cumulative failure after salvage treatment was defined as including both 2nd BCF and CP.  Results:   The median duration of follow-up was 55 months (interquartile range, 35-97 months). Thirty-seven (39.4%) patients were treated with ADT alone, and 57 patients (60.6%) were treated with a combination of ADT with RT. During follow-up period, the incidence of failure after salvage treatment in the ADT alone group and the combined treatment group was 89.2% and 45.6%, respectively (HR, 22.4; 95% CI 5.43-92.1; P < 0.001). The combination of ADT with RT was associated with better 2nd BCF and PFS than ADT alone (P = 0.007 and P = 0.015, respectively). In multivariate analyses, number of positive LN ≥ 2 and PSA nadir ≥ 0.005 ng/ml after RP were associated with poor 2nd BCF, CP, and PFS after salvage treatment. Salvage by combined ADT plus RT showed better 2nd BCF and PFS than ADT alone. Specifically, patients with number of positive LN ≥ 2 or PSA nadir ≥ 0.005 ng/ml after RP showed better 2nd BCF (P = 0.004) or PFS (P = 0.011) when treated with ADT plus RT rather than ADT alone.  Conclusions:   In patients with LNP prostate cancer, salvage ADT plus RT improved 2nd BCF and PFS compared to ADT alone. In particular, when the patients had more than two positive lymph nodes or PSA nadir ≥ 0.005 ng/ml after RP, ADT with RT seems to be a more beneficial salvage treatment resulting in better 2nd BCF and PFS.""","""['Dowook Kim', 'Dong-Yun Kim', 'Jae-Sung Kim', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Sang Eun Lee']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Upfront androgen deprivation therapy with salvage radiation may improve biochemical outcomes in prostate cancer patients with post-prostatectomy rising PSA.', 'Combination of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Salvage Radiotherapy versus Salvage Radiotherapy Alone for Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Treatment failure and clinical progression after salvage therapy in men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: radiotherapy vs androgen deprivation.', 'Use of androgen deprivation and salvage radiation therapy for patients with prostate cancer and biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy.', 'How can we best manage biochemical failure after radical prostatectomy?']"""

Here, we have taken an alternative approach using the cochaperone BAG1L, which interacts with the NTD, to develop a novel AR inhibitor.

In these settings, we must be careful about the causal interpretation of classical statistical estimands. In particular, estimands on the hazard scale, such as ratios of cause-specific or subdistribution hazards, are fundamentally hard to interpret causally. Estimands on the risk scale, such as contrasts of cumulative incidence functions, do have a clear causal interpretation, but they only capture the total effect of the treatment on the event of interest; that is, effects both through and outside of the competing event. To disentangle causal treatment effects on the event of interest and competing events, the separable direct and indirect effects were recently introduced. Here we provide new results on the estimation of direct and indirect separable effects in continuous time. In particular, we derive the nonparametric influence function in continuous time and use it to construct an estimator that has certain robustness properties. We also propose a simple estimator based on semiparametric models for the two cause-specific hazard functions. We describe the asymptotic properties of these estimators and present results from simulation studies, suggesting that the estimators behave satisfactorily in finite samples.

Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay was used to investigate the association between miR-184 and DLX1, and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analyses were utilized to determine the mRNA and protein levels. miR-184 expression was found to be downregulated whereas DLX1 was upregulated in PC tissues compared with normal prostate tissues. Cell propagation, migration and invasion were all inhibited by miR-184 upregulation in Du145 cells. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed the association between miR-184 and DLX1. The inhibitory effect of miR-184 mimic on cell behaviors was reversed by upregulation of DLX1.

Current treatment modalities for spinal metastases include both systemic and localized treatments that aim to decrease pain, improve mobility and structural stability, and control tumour growth. With the development of non-toxic photosensitizer drugs, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown promise as a minimally invasive non-thermal alternative in oncology, including for spinal metastases. To apply PDT to spinal metastases, predictive algorithms that optimize tumour treatment and minimize the risk of spinal cord damage are needed to assess the feasibility of the treatment and encourage a broad acceptance of PDT in clinical trials. This work presents a framework for PDT modelling and planning, and simulates the feasibility of using a BPD-MA mediated PDT to treat bone metastases at two different wavelengths (690 nm and 565 nm). An open-source software for PDT planning, PDT-SPACE, is used to evaluate different configurations of light diffusers (cut-end and cylindrical) fibres with optimized power allocation in order to minimize the damage to spinal cord or maximize tumour destruction. The work is simulated on three CT images of metastatically involved vertebrae acquired from three patients with spinal metastases secondary to colorectal or lung cancer. Simulation results show that PDT at a 565 nm wavelength has the ability to treat 90% of the metastatic lesion with less than 17% damage to the spinal cord. However, the energy required, and hence treatment time, to achieve this outcome with the 565 nm is infeasible. The energy required and treatment time for the longer wavelength of 690 nm is feasible ([Formula: see text] min), but treatment aimed at 90% of the metastatic lesion would severely damage the proximal spinal cord. PDT-SPACE provides a simulation platform that can be used to optimize PDT delivery in the metastatic spine. While this work serves as a prospective methodology to analyze the feasibility of PDT for tumour ablation in the spine, preclinical studies in an animal model are ongoing to elucidate the spinal cord damage extent as a function of PDT dose, and the resulting short and long term functional impairments. These will be required before there can be any consideration of clinical trials.""","""['Abdul-Amir Yassine#', 'William C Y Lo#', 'Tina Saeidi', 'Dallis Ferguson', 'Cari M Whyne', 'Margarete K Akens', 'Vaughn Betz', 'Lothar Lilge']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Defining the therapeutic window of vertebral photodynamic therapy in a murine pre-clinical model of breast cancer metastasis using the photosensitizer BPD-MA (Verteporfin).', 'Beyond bisphosphonates: photodynamic therapy structurally augments metastatically involved vertebrae and destroys tumor tissue.', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'Beyond radiation therapy: photodynamic therapy maintains structural integrity of irradiated healthy and metastatically involved vertebrae in a pre-clinical in vivo model.', 'Photodynamic therapy in spinal metastases: a qualitative analysis of published results.', 'First Clinical Report of the Intraoperative Macro- and Micro-Photodiagnosis and Photodynamic Therapy Using Talaporfin Sodium for a Patient with Disseminated Lumbar Medulloblastoma.', 'The Value of 320-Slice Spiral Computed Tomography Perfusion Imaging in Staging and Long-Term Dynamic Evaluation of Breast Cancer.', 'Scalable and accessible personalized photodynamic therapy optimization with FullMonte and PDT-SPACE.']"""

In addition to thermo-, pH-, light-, enzyme- or redox-responsive liposomes, which have had promising results in (pre-) clinical studies, ultrasound-triggered sonosensitive liposomes represent an exciting alternative to locally trigger the release from these cargos. Localized drug release requires precise tumor visualization to produce a targeted and ultrasound stimulus. We used ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) with BR55, a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2)-targeted ultrasound contrast agent, to guide ultrasound-triggered release of sonosensitive liposomes encapsulating doxorubicin (L-DXR) in an orthotopic prostatic rodent tumor model. Forty-eight hours after L-DXR injection, local release of doxorubicin was triggered with a confocal ultrasound device with two focused transducers, 1.1-MHz center frequency, and peak positive and negative pressures of 20.5 and 13 MPa at focus.

An atlas-based automatic segmentation was developed to improve the delineation efficiency and reduce inter-observer variation. Additionally, automated segmentation using artificial intelligence (AI) has recently become available. In this study, auto-segmentations by atlas- and AI-based models for Organs at Risk (OAR) in patients with prostate and head and neck cancer were performed and delineation accuracies were evaluated.  Methods:   Twenty-one patients with prostate cancer and 30 patients with head and neck cancer were evaluated. MIM Maestro was used to apply the atlas-based segmentation. MIM Contour ProtégéAI was used to apply the AI-based segmentation. Three similarity indices, the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), and mean distance to agreement (MDA), were evaluated and compared with manual delineations. In addition, radiation oncologists visually evaluated the delineation accuracies.  Results:   Among patients with prostate cancer, the AI-based model demonstrated higher accuracy than the atlas-based on DSC, HD, and MDA for the bladder and rectum. Upon visual evaluation, some errors were observed in the atlas-based delineations when the boundary between the small bowel or the seminal vesicle and the bladder was unclear. For patients with head and neck cancer, no significant differences were observed between the two models for almost all OARs, except small delineations such as the optic chiasm and optic nerve. The DSC tended to be lower when the HD and the MDA were smaller in small volume delineations.  Conclusions:   In terms of efficiency, the processing time for head and neck cancers was much shorter than manual delineation. While quantitative evaluation with AI-based segmentation was significantly more accurate than atlas-based for prostate cancer, there was no significant difference for head and neck cancer. According to the results of visual evaluation, less necessity of manual correction in AI-based segmentation indicates that the segmentation efficiency of AI-based model is higher than that of atlas-based model. The effectiveness of the AI-based model can be expected to improve the segmentation efficiency and to significantly shorten the delineation time.""","""['Yuka Urago', 'Hiroyuki Okamoto', 'Tomoya Kaneda', 'Naoya Murakami', 'Tairo Kashihara', 'Mihiro Takemori', 'Hiroki Nakayama', 'Kotaro Iijima', 'Takahito Chiba', 'Junichi Kuwahara', 'Shouichi Katsuta', 'Satoshi Nakamura', 'Weishan Chang', 'Hidetoshi Saitoh', 'Hiroshi Igaki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Clinical evaluation of multi-atlas based segmentation of lymph node regions in head and neck and prostate cancer patients.', 'Clinical Validation of a Deep-Learning Segmentation Software in Head and Neck: An Early Analysis in a Developing Radiation Oncology Center.', 'Fully automatic multi-organ segmentation for head and neck cancer radiotherapy using shape representation model constrained fully convolutional neural networks.', 'Auto-segmentation of organs at risk for head and neck radiotherapy planning: From atlas-based to deep learning methods.', 'Rapid advances in auto-segmentation of organs at risk and target volumes in head and neck cancer.', 'Young oncologists benefit more than experts from deep learning-based organs-at-risk contouring modeling in nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy: A multi-institution clinical study exploring working experience and institute group style factor.', 'How smart is artificial intelligence in organs delineation?

Results:   Of 6,775 men included in the analysis, 2,260 (33.4%) converted to treatment at a median followup of 6.7 years.

Patients with high-volume GG1 tumors had a shorter interval to conversion than those with low-volume GG1 tumors and behaved like the higher-risk patients. We found no significant association between the time to conversion and self-reported race or genetic ancestry.  Conclusions:   A shorter time to conversion from active surveillance to treatment was associated with higher-risk clinicopathological tumor features.

However, longitudinal microbiota alterations during the development of cancers are relatively unexplored. To better understand how microbiota changes, we profiled the gut microbiota composition from prostate cancer-bearing mice and control mice at five different time points. Distinct gut microbiota differences were found between cancer-bearing mice and control mice. Akkermansiaceae was found to be significantly higher in the first three weeks in cancer-bearing mice, which implies its role in the early stage of cancer colonization. We also found that Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae were more abundant in the second and last sampling week, respectively. The increments of Akkermansiaceae, Bifidobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae were previously found to be associated with responses to immunotherapy, which suggests links between these bacteria families and cancers. Additionally, our function analysis showed that the bacterial taxa carrying steroid biosynthesis and butirosin and neomycin biosynthesis were increased, whereas those carrying naphthalene degradation decreased in cancer-bearing mice.

This suggests a potential role of clonal hematopoiesis or germline predisposition in these cases. During the screening of 75 CLL cases for kappa and lambda light-chain rearrangements, we could detect a single case with CLL cells expressing two distinct kappa and lambda light chains paired with two separate immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions. Furthermore, this patient also developed a prostate carcinoma.

Targeting and inhibiting SOX2 is clinically relevant as high SOX2 mRNA levels are positively correlated with decreased overall survival and progression-free survival in patients affected with breast cancer. Given its key role as a master regulator of cell proliferation, SOX2 represents an important scaffold for the engineering of dominant-negative synthetic DNA-binding domains (DBDs) that act by blocking or interfering with the oncogenic activity of the endogenous transcription factor in cancer cells. We have synthesized an interference peptide (iPep) encompassing a truncated 24 amino acid long C-terminus of SOX2 containing a potential SOX-specific nuclear localization sequence, and the determinants of the binding of SOX2 to the DNA and to its transcription factor binding partners. We found that the resulting peptide (SOX2-iPep) possessed intrinsic cell penetration and promising nuclear localization into breast cancer cells, and decreased cellular proliferation of SOX2 overexpressing cell lines. The novel SOX2-iPep was found to exhibit a random coil conformation predominantly in solution. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to characterize the interactions of both the SOX2 transcription factor and the SOX2-iPep with FGF4-enhancer DNA in the presence of the POU domain of the partner transcription factor OCT4. Predictions of the free energy of binding revealed that the iPep largely retained the binding affinity for DNA of parental SOX2. This work will enable the future engineering of novel dominant interference peptides to transport different therapeutic cargo molecules such as anti-cancer drugs into cells.""","""['Neha S Gandhi', 'Edina Wang', 'Anabel Sorolla', 'Yu Jie Kan', 'Adil Malik', 'Jyotsna Batra', 'Kimberly A Young', 'Wan Jun Tie', 'Pilar Blancafort', 'Ricardo L Mancera']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Cooperative DNA Recognition Modulated by an Interplay between Protein-Protein Interactions and DNA-Mediated Allostery.', 'Nuclear reprogramming of luminal-like breast cancer cells generates Sox2-overexpressing cancer stem-like cellular states harboring transcriptional activation of the mTOR pathway.', 'Structural Mechanism behind Distinct Efficiency of Oct4/Sox2 Proteins in Differentially Spaced DNA Complexes.', 'Yin Yang 1 is associated with cancer stem cell transcription factors (SOX2, OCT4, BMI1) and clinical implication.', 'The transcriptional foundation of pluripotency.', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptide-Based Delivery of Macromolecular Drugs: Development, Strategies, and Progress.', 'Are Transcription Factors Plausible Oncotargets for Triple Negative Breast Cancers?']"""

ATAD2 functions as a co-activator of the androgen and estrogen receptors as well as the MYC and E2F transcription factors. ATAD2 also functions during DNA replication, recognizing newly synthesized histones. In addition, ATAD2 is shown to be up-regulated in multiple forms of cancer including breast, lung, gastric, endometrial, renal, and prostate. Furthermore, up-regulation of ATAD2 is strongly correlated with poor prognosis in many types of cancer, making the ATAD2 bromodomain an innovative target for cancer therapeutics. In this study, we describe the recognition of histone acetyllysine modifications by the ATAD2 bromodomain. Residue-specific information on the complex formed between the histone tail and the ATAD2 bromodomain, obtained through nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and X-ray crystallography, illustrates key residues lining the binding pocket, which are involved in coordination of di-acetylated histone tails. Analytical ultracentrifugation, NMR relaxation data, and isothermal titration calorimetry further confirm the monomeric state of the functionally active ATAD2 bromodomain in complex with di-acetylated histone ligands. Overall, we describe histone tail recognition by ATAD2 BRD and illustrate that one acetyllysine group is primarily engaged by the conserved asparagine (N1064), the ""RVF"" shelf residues, and the flexible ZA loop.

Study design:   Analytical study. Place & Duration of Study: Goztepe Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey, from June 2019 to January 2020.  Methodology:   Images of 185 men, who underwent mp-MRI, were reviewed and ep-IFs were also classified as urologic or non-urologic and benign or malign. The PI-RADS score was also recorded in biopsy-naïve subjects or in whom a sufficient time (which would not impair imaging) was elapsed after the biopsy. The cases were also divided into two groups, according to the PI-RADS score (Group 1: PI-RADS 1 or 2, Group 2: PI-RADS 3 or more) and the incidental findings (IFs) were compared between the groups.  Results:   Overall, 139 ep-IFs were detected in 88 (47.6%) patients. The remaining 97 (52.4%) cases were free of ep-IFs. The ep-IFs were benign in 85 (96.6%) and malignant in 3 (3.4%) cases.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether transfer learning, unsupervised pre-training and test-time augmentation significantly improved the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pixel-by-pixel prediction of cancer vs. non-cancer using mp-MRI datasets.  Methods:   154 subjects undergoing mp-MRI were prospectively recruited, 16 of whom subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. Logistic regression, random forest and CNN models were trained on mp-MRI data using histopathology as the gold standard. Transfer learning, unsupervised pre-training and test-time augmentation were used to boost CNN performance. Models were evaluated using Dice score and area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) with leave-one-subject-out cross validation. Permutation feature importance testing was performed to evaluate the relative value of each MR contrast to CNN model performance. Statistical significance (p<0.05) was determined using the paired Wilcoxon signed rank test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple comparisons.  Results:   Baseline CNN outperformed logistic regression and random forest models. Transfer learning and unsupervised pre-training did not significantly improve CNN performance over baseline; however, test-time augmentation resulted in significantly higher Dice scores over both baseline CNN and CNN plus either of transfer learning or unsupervised pre-training. The best performing model was CNN with transfer learning and test-time augmentation (Dice score of 0.59 and AUROC of 0.93). The most important contrast was apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), followed by Ktrans and T2, although each contributed significantly to classifier performance.  Conclusions:   The addition of transfer learning and test-time augmentation resulted in significant improvement in CNN segmentation performance in a small set of prostate cancer mp-MRI data. Results suggest that these techniques may be more broadly useful for the optimization of deep learning algorithms applied to the problem of semantic segmentation in biomedical image datasets.

The false positive rate probability (FPRP) method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. Gene-based analysis was calculated by versatile gene-based association study approach.  Results:   We found that SLC11A1 rs7573065 significantly increased the risk of prostate cancer [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.06-1.46, P = 7.02 × 10-3, FPRP = 0.082]. Furthermore, rs7573065 was confirmed as the independent predicator of overall survival (OS) for prostate cancer patients [Hazard ratio (HR) = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.01-1.66, P = 0.041]. The significant association between SLC11A1 and prostate cancer risk was calculated by gene-based analysis (P = 0.030). We also observed that the mRNA of SLC11A1 in prostate tumor tissues was significantly over-expressed than that in normal tissues.  Conclusion:   This study suggested that rs7573065 in SLC11A1 was associated with an increased risk and poor OS of prostate cancer.

A patient with elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) underwent multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate that revealed a prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PI-RADS) four lesion. The patient subsequently had a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided MRI fusion biopsy of the target lesion as well as a systematic biopsy and was only found to have Gleason 3 + 4 prostate cancer in the 0.5 cc mpMRI target. The lesion plus a treatment margin was ablated with cryotherapy utilizing a traditional transperineal approach. Patient position, ultrasound and mpMRI image fusion, insertion of cryoablation needles, ablation of the prostate cancer lesion, and postoperative care were reviewed. Equipment used during the operation was itemized and described. This guide explores the necessary equipment, procedural steps, and tips for success when performing focal cryoablation of the prostate. The technique described represents the culmination of knowledge gathered with 30 years of experience performing cryoablation of prostate cancer. The accompanying video highlights the utilization of mpMRI and TRUS image fusion, triangulation of lethal ice around the prostate cancer lesion, and the importance of monitoring real-time ice formation with TRUS imaging.

It has been shown that the minimally invasive robotic approach offers comparable oncologic and functional outcomes with potential advantages, including decreased blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and recovery period when compared with open surgery. Generally, the transperitoneal RARP approach is the most commonly performed among robotic surgeons, owing to its wider space and early adoption. However, similar oncologic outcomes have been reported with the extraperitoneal approach. Owing to its perceived technical difficulty, extraperitoneal RARP is less adopted nowadays. This approach, however, has its merits particularly in cases where intraperitoneal access can be problematic with extensive adhesions from previous surgeries. Also, extraperitoneal approach allows for minimal bowel manipulation, less steep Trendelenburg positioning, and less pneumoperitoneum, which reflect on early recovery of bowel function after RARP. Both transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approaches can be performed using either the conventional multiport robotic system or the more recent single-port (SP) robotic system. With respect to extraperitoneal RARP, there has been an increased adoption of the SP system, with purported advantages such as better cosmesis, less postoperative analgesic and opioid requirements, and shorter duration of hospital stay.

NET G3 samples were more often obtained from metastatic sites (69%) than NET G1/G2 samples (24%). NET G3 metastases presented most frequently in the liver (74%) and originated from the pancreas (38/90, 42%), followed by the lung (9%), ileum (7%), stomach (3%), rectum (1%), and rare sites (2%) such as the prostate and breast. The primaries remained unknown in 15%. NETs G3 had a median Ki67 of 30% that distinguished them from NECs (60%), though with great overlap. The expression of site-specific markers, p53, Rb1, and SST2 was similar in NETs G3 and NETs G1/G2, except for p53 and Rb1 which were abnormally expressed in 8% and 7% of liver metastases from NET G3 but not from NET G1/G2. NETs G3 were frequently referred as NECs (39%) but could be well distinguished from NECs by normal p53 (92% versus 21%) and Rb1 expression (93% versus 41%) expression. In conclusion, NETs G3 are frequently discovered as liver metastases from pancreatic or pulmonary primaries and are often misinterpreted as NEC. p53 and Rb1 are powerful markers in the distinction of NET G3 from NEC.

Moreover, we observed that LD content was tightly connected with the iron metabolism and in particular with the presence of the ferritin heavy chain (FTH1). In fact, breast and lung cancer cells silenced for the FTH1 gene showed a reduction in the LD numbers and, by consequence, became radiosensitive. FTH1 overexpression as well as iron-chelating treatment by Deferoxamine were able to restore the LD amount and RR.

Material and methods:   A retrospective, single-institution study of men with localised PC. The mean age was 66 years and 54.7% had high-risk PC according to the Cambridge prognostic group (CPG) classification. The treatment was delivered as EBRT (2 Gy × 25) and HDRBT (10 Gy × 2) with combined androgen blockade (CAB). The median follow-up was 10.2 years.  Results:   The cumulative incidence of PCSD at 10 years was 5% [CI 95% 0.04-0.06]. The 10 years PCSD per risk group were: low (L) 0.4%, intermediate favourable (IF) 1%, intermediate unfavourable (IU) 4.3%, high-risk favourable (HF) 5.8%, and high-risk unfavourable (HU) 13.9%. The PCSF rate at 10 years was 16.5% [CI 95% 0.15-0.18]. The PCSF per risk group at 10 years were: L 2.5%, IF 5.5%, IU 15.9%, HF 15.6%, and HU 38.99%. PCSF occurred in 399 men, of whom 15% were found to have local failure. The estimated frequency of local failure in the entire cohort was 1.2%.  Conclusions:   HDRBT combined with EBRT is an effective treatment with long-term overall survival and excellent local control for patients with PC.

Diagnosis has mostly been by primary prostate biopsy.  Case presentation:   A 60-year-old man had malaise, low platelet count (9000/μL), and high prostate-specific antigen (1382 ng/mL). Bone marrow biopsy showed strongly positive immunostaining NKX3.1, leading to diagnosis of prostate cancer bone marrow metastasis, cT3aN1M1b. Definitive diagnosis by prostate biopsy was difficult because of the sparsity of atypical glands. He had progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer after 3 months of hormonal therapy, and received 27 courses of docetaxel and six courses of cabazitaxel as chemotherapy, but finally died of respiratory failure 33 months after the start of treatment.

Our study demonstrated that 1533 genes with increased expression and 2301 genes with decreased expression in PCa. Bioinformatics analysis data indicated that these up-regulated genes had an association with the modulation of mitotic nuclear division, sister chromatid cohesion, cell division, and cell cycle. Additionally, our results revealed downregulated genes took part in modulating extracellular matrix organization, angiogenesis, signal transduction, and Ras signaling pathway. Hub upregulated and downregulated PPI networks were identified by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and MCODE analysis. Of note, 12 cell cycle regulators, comprising CCNB1, CCNB2, PLK1, TTK, AURKA, CDC20, BUB1, PTTG1, CDC45, CDC25C, CCNA2, and BUB1B, were demonstrated to function crucially in PCa development. By detecting their expression in PCa cell lines, we confirmed that these cell cycle regulator expressions were heightened in PCa cells. GEPIA databases analysis showed that higher expression of these cell cycle regulators was correlated to shorter disease-free survival (DFS) time in PCa samples.

Immunotherapies hold promise, but cancer antigen-targeting immunotherapies have largely failed to induce effective T cell receptor-mediated antitumor response. However, T cell-engaging bispecific antibodies (T-BsAbs) have yet to be adequately explored.  Methods:   Rehumanized STEAP1-IgG was used to build T-BsAb (named BC261) using the 2+2 IgG-[L]-scFv platform carrying the anti-CD3 huOKT3 scFv as the second specificity. Its binding epitope mapping, species cross-reactivity, tumor cell line staining, and in vitro cytotoxicity were investigated thoroughly. Its potency in driving tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was quantified using bioluminescence, correlated with in vivo antitumor response against cell line-derived or patient-derived xenografts (CDXs or PDXs) and compared with anti-STEAP1 T-BsAbs built on representative antibody platforms.  Results:   BC261 binding epitope was mapped to its second extracellular domain of STEAP1 shared among canine and primate orthologs. BC261 induced potent cytotoxicity against panels of EFT, prostate cancer, and canine osteosarcoma cell lines despite their low antigen density. BC261 drove significantly more TILs into tumors (30-fold) and exerted superior antitumor effects compared with the other standard BsAb platforms. The antitumor efficacy of BC261 was consistent against EFT and prostate cancer CDXs and PDXs.  Conclusions:   BC261 was highly efficient in driving T cell infiltration and tumor ablation.

Design:   A descriptive, cross-sectional study.  Subjects and setting:   The sample comprising 37 males with prostate cancer who underwent LRP was recruited within first 2 years. The study setting was a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. An additional 78 individuals who responded to a mailed invitation sent from September 2015 to October 2016 participated in the study.  Methods:   Participants completed a questionnaire that queried demographic and pertinent clinical data. The questionnaire also included 2 validated instruments. The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) was used to assess urinary incontinence (UI) following radical prostatectomy and its severity. The Strategy and Effectiveness of Symptom Self-Management questionnaire of Postprostatectomy Incontinence (SESSM-PPI) was used to evaluate self-management of UI, including strategies used and their perceived effectiveness.  Results:   Data analysis was based on 115 respondents who completed all components of the questionnaire; 95 (82.6%) indicated having UI. Forty-one patients (43.2%) indicated mild UI, 47 (49.5%) indicated moderate UI, and 7 (7.4%) indicated severe UI. The mean score of the SESSM-PPI was 14.04 ± 7.92, indicating a low level of self-management.The top 5 strategies with moderate effectiveness were in the following order: ""use pads or adult diapers""; ""pelvic floor muscle training""; ""avoid extracting heavy objects""; ""avoid drinking""; and ""eat more fruit to prevent constipation."" The Spearman correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between the frequency of use of self-management strategies and incontinence severity.

These diseases share many risk factors. Control of traditional risk factors for CVD was associated with lower incidence of cancers.  Objective:   To analyze CVD and cancer mortality rate trends in Brazilian population aged 35-74 years from 1996 to 2017.  Methods:   Crude and age-adjusted death rate trends were analyzed for all causes of death, CVD, and cancer. Data were obtained from mortality database of the Ministry of Health. Joinpoint Regression Program performed analysis of trends and adjustments in death rates. The degree of changes was determined by the average annual percent change (AAPC). Level of statistical significance was set at p <0.05.  Results:   Mortality from all causes of death (AAPC=-1.6%; p<0.001), CVD (AAPC=-2.3; p<0.001), ischemic heart disease (IHD) (AAPC=-1.6; p<0.001) and stroke (AAPC=-3.7; p<0.001) declined. Same trends were observed for CVD (p<0.001) in men and women. Death rates from all causes of cancer (AAPC=-0.1; p=0.201), in men (AAPC=-0.1; p=0.193) and in women (AAPC=-0.1; p=0,871) remained unchanged. In 2002, mortality from cancer exceeded the sum of deaths from IHD and stroke. If trends continue, cancer mortality will also exceed mortality from CVD by 2024. In women, death rates from breast, lung and colon cancer increased, and from cervical and gastric cancers decreased. In men, mortality from lung, stomach and esophagus cancer decreased, and from prostate cancer remained unchanged.

Herein, a convenient, reliable and specific strategy was proposed to screen prostate cancer (PCa) individuals through indirectly quantifying sarcosine, an early indicator of PCa, in the clinical urine samples. The success roots in the rational design of a cascade response model, which takes integrated sarcosine oxidase (SOX) as a specific recognition unit and oxygen-sensitive molecule as a signal reporter. The newly developed hierarchical mesoporous Zr-based metal-organic frameworks with continuously tunable mesopore size ensure the synergetic work of the SOX and response unit spatially separated in their neighboring mesoporous and microporous domains, respectively. The large mesopore up to 12.1 nm not only greatly enhances the loading capacity of SOX but also spares enough space for the free diffusion of sarcosine. On this basis, the probe is competent to specifically check out the tiny concentration change of sarcosine in the urine sample between PCa patients and healthy humans. Such a concept of enzyme-assisted substrate sensing could be simply extended by altering the type of immobilized enzymes, hopefully setting a guideline for the rational design of multiple probes to quantify specific biomarkers in complex biological samples.""","""['Liwei Zhao', 'Jian Yang', 'Ming Gong', 'Ke Li', 'Jinlou Gu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Am Chem Soc""","""['A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.', 'Sarcosine oxidase composite screen-printed electrode for sarcosine determination in biological samples.', 'A Ti3 C2 TX /Pt-Pd based amperometric biosensor for sensitive cancer biomarker detection.', 'The family of sarcosine oxidases: Same reaction, different products.', 'Nucleic acids biosensors based on metal-organic framework (MOF): Paving the way to clinical laboratory diagnosis.', 'Hofmeister Effects Shine in Nanoscience.', 'Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)-A Universal Material for Biomedicine.', 'Nanoemulsion-directed growth of MOFs with versatile architectures for the heterogeneous regeneration of coenzymes.', 'Cyanine-Doped Lanthanide Metal-Organic Frameworks for Near-Infrared II Bioimaging.']"""

However, many clinical trials implementing peptides targeting these proteins have yielded suboptimal results. Using spherical nucleic acids (SNAs), we explore how precise architectural control of vaccine components can activate a robust antigen-specific immune response in comparison to clinical formulations of the same targets. The SNA vaccines incorporate peptides for human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) or T-cell receptor γ alternate reading frame protein (TARP) into an optimized architecture, resulting in high rates of immune activation and cytolytic ability in humanized mice and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs). Specifically, administered SNAs elevate the production and secretion of cytokines and increase polyfunctional cytotoxic T cells and effector memory. Importantly, T cells raised from immunized mice potently kill targets, including clinically relevant cells expressing the whole PSMA protein. Treatment of hPBMCs increases costimulatory markers and cytolytically active T cells. This work demonstrates the importance of vaccine structure and its ability to reformulate and elevate clinical targets. Moreover, it encourages the field to reinvestigate ineffective peptide targets and repackage them into optimally structured vaccines to harness antigen potency and enhance clinical outcomes.""","""['Michelle H Teplensky', 'Jasper W Dittmar', 'Lei Qin', 'Shuya Wang', 'Michael Evangelopoulos', 'Bin Zhang', 'Chad A Mirkin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Adv Healthc Mater""","""['Development of Spherical Nucleic Acids for Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'DNA fusion gene vaccines induce cytotoxic T-cell attack on naturally processed peptides of human prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Vaccines targeting the cancer-testis antigen SSX-2 elicit HLA-A2 epitope-specific cytolytic T cells.', 'Prostate cancer vaccines: current status and future potential.', 'DNA vaccine for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Spherical nucleic acids-based nanoplatforms for tumor precision medicine and immunotherapy.', 'In Vivo Behavior of Ultrasmall Spherical Nucleic Acids.', 'Molecular DNA dendron vaccines.', 'Rational Vaccinology: Harnessing Nanoscale Chemical Design for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Spherical Nucleic Acids as Precision Therapeutics for the Treatment of Cancer-From Bench to Bedside.']"""

Limited data on this modality have been published regarding large samples treated in everyday practice.  Methods:   We analyzed prospectively collected registry data regarding lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA-617 RLT of 254 consecutive men with mCRPC seen in everyday academic practice. Since 177Lu-PSMA-617 was experimental salvage treatment following failure of individually appropriate conventional therapies, patients were generally elderly and heavily pretreated (median age 70 years; prior taxanes 74.0%, 188/254), with late-end-stage disease (visceral metastasis in 32.7%, 83/254). Primary endpoints were response to RLT, defined by changes from baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and overall survival (OS), estimated with Kaplan-Meier statistics, and caregiver-reported and patient-reported safety. Unless noted, median (minimum-maximum) values are given.  Results:   Patients received 3 (1-13) 177Lu-PSMA-617 activities (6.5 [2.5-11.6] GBq/cycle) every 5.7 (3.0-11.0) weeks. Best response was ≥ 50% PSA reduction in 52.0% of patients (132/254). PSA-PFS was 5.5 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 4.4-6.6) months and OS, 14.5 (95%CI 11.5-17.5) months. In multivariable Cox proportional-hazards modeling, response to the initial ≤ 2 RLT administrations was the strongest significant prognosticator related to OS (hazard ratio 3.7 [95%CI 2.5-5.5], p < 0.001). No RLT-related deaths or treatment discontinuations occurred; the most frequent RLT-related Grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (18/254 patients, 7.1%), thrombocytopenia (11/254, 4.3%), and lymphopenia (7/254, 2.8%). RLT-related xerostomia, all grade 1/2, was noted in 53/254 (20.9%).  Conclusions:   In a large, prospectively observed ""real-world"" cohort with late-stage/end-stage mCRPC and conventional treatment failure, 177Lu-PSMA-617 RLT was effective, safe, and well-tolerated.

Each drug have demonstrated a survival gain in studies, but little is known about the impact in a general population of mPCa patients. In this study we assessed survival before and after introduction of the new drugs for Norwegian mPCa patients.  Methods:   Survival was assessed in 5542 patients with primary mPCa. The patients were diagnosed between 2004 and 2018, identified in the Norwegian Cancer Registry. We also analyzed a subgroup of 2738 patients possibly eligible for treatment with new drugs (age <80 years, WHO performance status ≤2 and not dead within 3 months from diagnosis). We estimated overall (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) across three diagnostic time periods reflecting to the drugs' introduction in Norway: Before (2004-2009), ""in between"" (2010-2014) and after the introduction (2015-2018).

High-dose radiotherapy may be synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors.  Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) in mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   From November 2017 to July 2019, this prospective phase 2 study enrolled 31 men with progressive mCRPC after at least one prior androgen receptor-directed therapy. Median follow-up was 18.0 mo.  Intervention:   Avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 wk for 24 wk (12 cycles). A single fraction of SABR (20 Gy) was administered to one or two disease sites within 5 d before the first and second avelumab treatments.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was the disease control rate (DCR), defined as a confirmed complete or partial response of any duration, or stable disease/non-complete response/non-progressive disease for ≥6 mo (Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 3-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1). Secondary endpoints were the objective response rate (ORR), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. DCR and ORR were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact binomial method.  Results and limitations:   Thirty-one evaluable men were enrolled (median age 71 yr, 71% with ≥2 prior mCRPC therapy lines, 81% with >5 total metastases). The DCR was 48% (15/31; 95% confidence interval [CI] 30-67%) and ORR was 31% (five of 16; 95% CI 11-59%). The ORR in nonirradiated lesions was 33% (four of 12; 95% CI 10-65%). Median rPFS was 8.4 mo (95% CI 4.5-not reached [NR]) and median OS was 14.1 mo (95% CI 8.9-NR). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in six patients (16%), with three (10%) requiring high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Plasma androgen receptor alterations were associated with lower DCR (22% vs 71%, p = 0.13; Fisher's exact test). Limitations include the small sample size and the absence of a control arm.  Conclusions:   Avelumab with SABR demonstrated encouraging activity and acceptable toxicity in treatment-refractory mCRPC. This combination warrants further investigation.  Patient summary:   In this study of men with advanced and heavily pretreated prostate cancer, combining stereotactic radiotherapy with avelumab immunotherapy was safe and resulted in nearly half of patients experiencing cancer control for 6 months or longer.

Its accuracy has been assessed in multiple validation studies, but its clinical impact among patients has not hitherto been assessed.  Objective:   To assess the impact of the tool on patient decision-making and disease perception.  Design, setting, and participants:   A multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed across eight UK centres among newly diagnosed men considering either active surveillance or radical treatment. A total of 145 patients were included between 2018 and 2020, with median age 67 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 61-72) and prostate-specific antigen 6.8 ng/ml (IQR 5.1-8.8).  Intervention:   Participants were randomised to either standard of care (SOC) information or SOC and a structured presentation of the Predict Prostate tool.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Validated questionnaires were completed by assessing the impact of the tool on decisional conflict, uncertainty, anxiety, and perception of survival.  Results and limitations:   Mean Decisional Conflict Scale scores were 26% lower in the Predict Prostate group (mean = 16.1) than in the SOC group (mean = 21.7; p = 0.027). Scores on the ""support"", ""uncertainty"", and ""value clarity"" subscales all favoured Predict Prostate (all p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in anxiety scores or final treatment selection between the two groups. Patient perception of 15-yr prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival benefit from radical treatment were considerably lower and more accurate among men in the Predict Prostate group (p < 0.001). In total, 57% of men reported that the Predict Prostate estimates for PCSM were lower than expected, and 36% reported being less likely to select radical treatment. Over 90% of patients in the intervention group found it useful and 94% would recommend it to others.  Conclusions:   Predict Prostate reduces decisional conflict and uncertainty, and shifts patient perception around prognosis to be more realistic. This randomised trial demonstrates that Predict Prostate can directly inform the complex decision-making process in prostate cancer and is felt to be useful by patients. Future larger trials are warranted to test its impact upon final treatment decisions.  Patient summary:   In this national study, we assessed the impact of an individualised risk communication tool, called Predict Prostate, on patient decision-making after a diagnosis of localised prostate cancer. Men were randomly assigned to two groups, which received either standard counselling and information, or this in addition to a structured presentation of the Predict Prostate tool. Men who saw the tool were less conflicted and uncertain in their decision-making, and recommended the tool highly. Those who saw the tool had more realistic perception about their long-term survival and the potential impact of treatment upon this.  Take home message:   The use of an individualised risk communication tool, such as Predict Prostate, reduces patient decisional conflict and uncertainty when deciding about treatment for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. The tool leads to more realistic perceptions about survival outcomes and prognosis.""","""['David Thurtle', 'Val Jenkins', 'Alex Freeman', 'Mike Pearson', 'Gabriel Recchia', 'Priya Tamer', 'Kelly Leonard', 'Paul Pharoah', 'Jonathan Aning', 'Sanjeev Madaan', 'Chee Goh', 'Serena Hilman', 'Stuart McCracken', 'Petre Cristian Ilie', 'Henry Lazarowicz', 'Vincent Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Perception of cancer and inconsistency in medical information are associated with decisional conflict: a pilot study of men with prostate cancer who undergo active surveillance.', 'Randomized controlled trial on the effect of an online decision aid for young female cancer patients regarding fertility preservation.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Examining the effectiveness and implementation of patient treatment decision-aid tools for men with localised prostate cancer: A systematic review.', ""Need for numbers: assessing cancer survivors' needs for personalized and generic statistical information."", 'Impact of centralization of prostate cancer services on the choice of radical treatment.']"""

The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence and the characteristics of double/multiple primary malignant tumors (D/MPMTs) with colorectal and prostatic origin, in patients admitted to a reference hospital in West Romania. A 4-year retrospective observational study (2016-2019) was conducted by analyzing the medical records of all patients admitted in the hospital. Demographic and clinical data, as well as tumor-related parameters, were extracted. We identified 413 consecutive hospitalized patients with PC, and 21 (5%) of them also had a primary CRC. At the time of diagnosis, the mean age of the patients with PC was 71.2 ± 6 years, and 71.8 ± 10 years for patients with CRC. Synchronous PC and CRC tumors were identified in 3/21 cases and metachronous tumors in 18/21 cases. Prostate cancer was the first tumor to be diagnosed in 13/18 cases and CRC in 5/18 cases. The most frequent subtype of PC was acinar adenocarcinoma (90%) and for CRC cases, conventional adenocarcinoma (90%). Prostate and colorectal cancers tend to co-occur in a single patient.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study of patients treated for COVID-19 in our institution who had a previous diagnosis of PC. We analyzed the influence of exposure of ADT on the presence of severe course of COVID-19.  Results:   A total of 2280 patients were treated in our center for COVID-19 with a worse course of disease in males (higher rates of hospitalization, intense care unit [ICU] admission, and death). Out of 1349 subjects registered in our PC database, 156 were on ADT and 1193 were not. Out of those, 61 (4.52%) PC patients suffered from COVID-19, 11 (18.0%) belonged to the ADT group, and 50 (82.0%) to the non-ADT group. Regarding the influence of ADT on the course of the disease, statistically significant differences were found neither in the death rate (27.3% vs. 34%; p = 0.481), nor in the presence of severe COVID-19: need for intubation or ICU admission (0% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.561) and need for corticoid treatment, interferon beta, or tocilizumab (60% vs. 34.7%; p = 0.128). Multivariate analysis adjusted for clinically relevant comorbidities did not find that ADT was a protective factor for worse clinical evolution (risk ratio [RR] 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-1.83; p = 0.77) or death (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.26-1.74; p = 0.41).

Since the fatty acid composition of peri-prostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) has been shown to differ according to the ethno-geographic origin and is involved in PCa aggressiveness, we aimed to analyze the cholesterol content of PPAT from Caucasian and African-Caribbean patients, in correlation with markers of disease aggressiveness and cholesterol metabolism in cancer tissues.  Methods:   The quantification of cholesterol in PPAT was analyzed in 52 Caucasian and 52 African-Caribbean PCa patients, with in each group 26 indolent tumors (ISUP Group1 and pT2) and 26 potentially aggressive tumors (ISUP Group 3-5 and/or pT3). The expression of proteins involved in cholesterol metabolism was analyzed by immunohistochemistry on cancer tissue samples included in tissue microarrays.  Results:   The amount of cholesterol esters was lower in PPAT from African-Caribbean patients compared with Caucasians, without any correlation with markers of disease aggressiveness. In cancer tissues from African-Caribbean patients, the expression of ABCA1 (involved in cholesterol efflux) was decreased, and that of SREBP-2 (involved in cholesterol uptake) was increased. In both groups of patients, SREBP-2 expression was strongly associated with that of Zeb1, a key player in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that cholesterol metabolism differs according to the ethno-geographic origin, in both PPAT and cancer tissues.

Methods:   Biochemical, histopathological and imaging data of 302 prostate cancer patients who underwent 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or PET/MR imaging for primary staging were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups as ""PET positive"" and ""PET negative"" according to the presence of pathologic extraprostatic PSMA involvement. ""PET positive"" patients were additionally divided into two groups: oligometastatic (1-3 metastatic lesion) and multimetastatic (>3 metastatic lesions).  Results:   The mean age of patients was 66.8 ± 7.6 years. Imaging modality was PET/MR in 223 (73.8%) and PET/CT in 79 (26.2%) of patients.

Recently, 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography has been successfully developed as an effective diagnostic tool for prostate cancer. However, the pathophysiological functions of PSMA in prostate tumors remain unclear.  Methods:   We examined the protein expression of PSMA in tumor endothelial cells in human prostate tumors by immunohistochemistry. Prostate cancer tissues were resected by robotic surgery in 2019 at Ehime University from patients with prostate cancer. In vitro, we prepared conditioned medium (CM) derived from a PSMA-positive human prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, cultured on collagen I gels. We then examined PSMA expression in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured with the CM. We assessed angiogenic activities by treatment of HUVECs with LNCaP-derived CM using a tube formation assay that mimics angiogenesis.  Results:   Immunohistochemistry of PSMA and CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, and PSMA-expressing tumor endothelial cells were observed in 4 of 33 prostate cancer patients (12.1%).

Methods:   This retrospective study included 20 patients who underwent 18 F-DCFPyL PET/MRI and 32 patients who underwent 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT and MRI from January 2019 to June 2020. All patients had TZ lesions and underwent prostate biopsies. One senior (reader 1) and one junior (reader 2) nuclear medicine physician evaluated each TZ lesion independently, according to the molecular imaging prostate-specific membrane antigen scoring system and the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1 (PI-RADS v2.1). The histologic diagnosis of prostate biopsy was used as the reference standard. The diagnostic performance of the two methods was compared in terms of inter-reader agreement and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve.  Results:   Of the 52 patients, 43 had TZ PCa. For inter-reader agreement, the kappa value was 0.883 for 18 F-DCFPyL PET and 0.393 for mp-MRI. For PET, both readers had the same diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 93.0%, 77.8%, and 90.4%, respectively. For mp-MRI, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy was 67.4%, 33.3%, and 61.5% for reader 1, and 51.2%, 44.4%, and 51.9% for reader 2, respectively. PET outperformed mp-MRI for both readers with an AUC of 0.872 for PET versus 0.584 for mp-MRI, p = .0209 for reader 1, and an AUC of 0.860 for PET versus 0.505 for mp-MRI, p = .0213 for reader 2. Among the 43 patients with TZ PCa, 18 F-DCFPyL PET detected a distant bone metastasis missed by the CT in one case and two small lymph node metastases missed by the CT and MRI in another case.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that 18 F-DCFPyL PET, which was almost independent of the experience of the readers, was more objective in the evaluation of TZ lesions, and had higher diagnostic value than mp-MRI.""","""['Yachao Liu', 'Yanliang Dong', 'Jiajin Liu', 'Xiaojun Zhang', 'Mu Lin', 'Baixuan Xu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prospective Comparison of PET Imaging with PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFPyL Versus Na18F for Bone Lesion Detection in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', '18F-DCFPyL Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Localization of Dominant Intraprostatic Foci: First Experience.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy and Interobserver Agreement of PI-RADS Version 2 and Version 2.1 for the Detection of Transition Zone Prostate Cancers.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-targeted biopsy for Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The diagnostic performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET in patients with suspected prostate cancer: A systemic review and meta-analysis.', 'Can 18F-PSMA-7Q PET/CT replace prostate biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer?-A single-center retrospective study.']"""

Multivariable logistic regression models predicted in-hospital complications.  Results:   Of all eligible 202,419 RP patients, 216 (0.1%) underwent RP after prior organ transplantation. Transplant RP patients exhibited higher proportions of Charlson comorbidity index ≥2 (13.0% vs. 3.0%), obesity (9.3% vs. 5.6%, both p < 0.05), versus to nontransplant RP. Of transplant RP patients, 96 underwent kidney (44.4%), 44 heart (20.4%), 40 liver (18.5%), 30 (13.9%) bone marrow, <11 lung (<5%), and <11 pancreatic (<5%) transplantation before RP.

Most studies have examined BRCA2 alone or an aggregate of BRCA1/2 and ATM. Emerging data suggest that ATM mutations may have distinct biology and warrant individual evaluation. The objective of this study is to determine whether response to prostate cancer systemic therapies differs between men with germline mutations in ATM (gATM) and BRCA2 (gBRCA2).  Methods:   This is an international multicenter retrospective matched cohort study of men with prostate cancer harboring gATM or gBRCA2. PSA50 response (≥50% decline in prostate-specific antigen) was compared using Fisher's exact test.  Results and limitations:   The study included 45 gATM and 45 gBRCA2 patients, matched on stage and year of germline testing. Patients with gATM and gBRCA2 had similar age, Gleason grade, and PSA at diagnosis. We did not observe differences in PSA50 responses to abiraterone, enzalutamide, or docetaxel in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer between the two groups; however, 0/7 with gATM and 12/14 with gBRCA2 achieved PSA50 response to PARPi (p < .001). Median (95% confidence interval) overall survival from diagnosis to death was 10.9 years (9.5-not reached) versus 9.9 years (7.1-not reached, p = .07) for the gATM and gBRCA2 cohorts, respectively.

Several previous studies showed conflicting results for the predictive role of systemic inflammation markers in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancers (CSPCs). We aimed to determine the predictive roles of lymphocyte-to-monocyte (LMR) and eosinophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (ELR) in the detection of CSPC at standard 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (12-core-TRUS-Bx) using our large-cohort database.  Methods:   Clinical and pathological data of a total of 1740 men, who underwent initial standard 12-core TRUS-Bx, were analyzed. LMR and ELR were calculated from the prebiopsy complete blood count. Definitions of CSPC, LMR, and ELR were ""Gleason grade group ≥2,"" ""the lymphocyte counts/the monocyte counts,"" and ""the eosinophil counts/the lymphocyte counts,"" respectively.  Results:   Median (interquartile range) of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and prostatic volume before TRUS-Bx were 7.59 (5.02-13.12) ng/ml and 38.2 (29.0-52.9) ml, respectively. Benign prostatic lesions, clinically insignificant prostate cancers (CIPCs), and CSPCs were detected in 1179 (67.8%), 180 (10.3%), and 381 (21.9%) patients, respectively. The patients with CSPCs had older age, a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus or hypertension, a higher rate of digital rectal examination abnormality, higher serum PSA level, lower serum testosterone level, and lower LMR than those with benign lesions or CIPCs. However, there was no difference in ELR among the three (benign lesions, CIPCs and CSPCs). In all the patients, multivariate regression analysis showed that lower LMR was an independent predictor of CSPCs compared with ELR. In the subset of men with prostate volume ≥39.3 ml, lower LMR was an independent predictor of CSPCs compared with ELR. In the subset of men with prostate volume <39.3 ml, men with lower LMR showed the tendency of having a higher probability of CSPCs without any statistical significance on the contrary to ELR.  Conclusions:   Our data indicate that LMR can play an independent predictive role in the detection of CSPCs at initial 12-core-TRUS-Bx compared with ELR. The predictive role of the LMR appears to be significant for men with larger prostate volume rather than those with smaller prostate volume.""","""['Min Chul Cho', 'Sangjun Yoo', 'Min Soo Choo', 'Hwancheol Son', 'Hyeon Jeong']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Comparison of Cancer Detection Rates Between TRUS-Guided Biopsy and MRI-Targeted Biopsy According to PSA Level in Biopsy-Naive Patients: A Propensity Score Matching Analysis.', 'Why and Where do We Miss Significant Prostate Cancer with Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging followed by Magnetic Resonance-guided and Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men?', 'Visually Estimated MRI Targeted Prostate Biopsy Could Improve the Detection of Significant Prostate Cancer in Patients with a PSA Level <10 ng/mL.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic Efficiency of Pan-Immune-Inflammation Value to Predict Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prostate-Specific Antigen between 4 and 20 ng/mL.', 'Association Between Pre-Treatment and Post-Treatment 3-Month Red Cell Distribution Width with Three-Year Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although most men who eventually undergo treatment have experienced clinical progression, a smaller subset elects treatment in the absence of disease reclassification. This study sought to understand factors associated with treatment in a large, contemporary, prospective cohort.  Methods:   This study identified 1789 men in the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study cohort enrolled as of 2020 with a median follow-up of 5.6 years. Clinical and demographic data as well as information on patient-reported quality of life and urinary symptoms were used in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models to identify factors associated with the time to treatment RESULTS: Within 4 years of their diagnosis, 33% of men (95% confidence interval [CI], 30%-35%) underwent treatment, and 10% (95% CI, 9%-12%) were treated in the absence of reclassification. The most significant factor associated with any treatment was an increasing Gleason grade group (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 14.5; 95% CI, 11.7-17.9). Urinary quality-of-life scores were associated with treatment without reclassification (aHR comparing ""mostly dissatisfied/terrible"" with ""pleased/mixed,"" 2.65; 95% CI, 1.54-4.59). In a subset analysis (n = 692), married men, compared with single men, were more likely to undergo treatment in the absence of reclassification (aHR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.04-6.66).  Conclusions:   A substantial number of men with prostate cancer undergo treatment in the absence of clinical changes in their cancers, and quality-of-life changes and marital status may be important factors in these decisions.  Lay summary:   This analysis of men on active surveillance for prostate cancer shows that approximately 1 in 10 men will decide to be treated within 4 years of their diagnosis even if their cancer is stable.

The molecular consequences of aberrant expression of PRMTs in PCa and the relationship between PRMTs and PCa progression are largely unknown. Using immunohistochemistry, we examined the expression of PRMT1 and CARM1, two of the best-studied PRMTs, in 288 patients across the spectrum of PCa and correlated them with markers of androgen receptor (AR) signaling, and milestones of carcinogenesis. Our findings indicate that PRMT1 and CARM1 are upregulated early in PCa progression, and that CARM1 is further upregulated after therapy. In addition, a correlation of CARM1 with AR post-translational modifications was noted in the setting of therapy resistance, highlighting CARM1 as one of the adaptation mechanisms of PCa cells in an androgen-depleted environment. Finally, CARM1 correlated with markers of cell cycle regulation, and both CARM1 and PRMT1 correlated with markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signaling.

EBRT was associated with significantly worse PCSS than both RP (HR: 1.88, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] [1.64-2.15], p < 0.001) and EBRT + BT (HR: 1.48, 95% CI [1.19-1.85], p = 0.002). In the matched cohorts, RP presented better OS (HR: 1.41, 95% CI [1.07-1.86], p = 0.041) and similar PCSS with EBRT + BT (HR: 1.50, 95% CI [0.91-2.47], p = 0.12). RP was associated with significantly better OS and PCSS outcomes than EBRT alone (OS HR: 1.58, 95% CI [1.59-2.12], p < 0.001; PCSS HR: 2.08 [1.60-2.72], p < 0.001). EBRT + BT also had significantly better OS and PCSS outcomes than EBRT alone (OS HR: 1.33, 95% CI [1.11-1.60], p < 0.001; PCSS HR: 1.57 [1.13-2.19], p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   For patients above 70 years with VHR PCa, RP was associated with better OS and similar PCSS than EBRT + BT.

However, despite the early susceptibility, patients receiving hormonal therapy targeting AR are likely to develops resistance to the treatment and progresses to the castration-resistant stage as a consequence of the mutation at the ligand binding pocket of AR. Interestingly, the surface pocket of the AR called binding function 3 (BF3) has been reported as a great benefit for treating a recurrent tumor. Herein, we investigate the potential of using a marine triterpenoid saponin, holothurin A, on targeting AR expression of prostate cancer using in vitro and in silico studies. Holothurin A reduced the PSA expression, leading to the growth inhibition of androgen sensitive prostate cancer cell line through a downregulation of AR activity. The molecular docking study demonstrated that holothurin A could bind strongly in the BF3 pocket by energetically favorable hydrogen acceptor and hydrophobic with a calculated binding affinity of -13.90 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulations provided the additional evidence that holothurin A can form a stable complex with the BF3 pocket through the hydrophobic interactions with VAL676, ILE680, and ALA721. As a consequence, holothurin A modulates the activation function-2 (AF2) site of the AR through repositioning of the residues in the AF2 pocket. Targeting alternatives sites on the surface of AR via holothurin A will provide a potential candidate for future prostate cancer treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The results showed that the expression levels of ZFC3H1 were notably lower than the corresponding non-cancerous tissues in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and patients in the high ZFC3H1-expression group showed poor survival. We hypothesized that the low expression of ZFC3H1 in tumor tissue might have be an inhibitory effect on the autoimmune system. We predicted the regulatory target and protein interaction partner network of ZFC3H1, and identified a PPI network composed of 26 node genes in PRAD. Furthermore, we found that the expression levels of MPHOSPH6 (encoding M-phase phosphoprotein 6) and MRPS31 (encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S31) were lower in PRAD tissues than in non-cancerous tissues, and the survival time of patients with high MPHOSPH6 and MRPS31 expression was poor. To further demonstrate the role of ZC3H1 in PRAD, we knocked-down the ZFC3H1 expression and found that the inhibition of ZFC3H1 significantly inhibited PRAD cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, ZFC3H1 siRNA treatment could reduce cell viability and increase the number of apoptotic cells in PRAD cells. Taken together, ZFC3H1 could represent a new marker for PRAD prognosis and provide a reference for the development of new therapies to treat PRAD.""","""['Hang Huang', 'Haokai Xu', 'Ping Li', 'Xueting Ye', 'Wei Chen', 'Wei Chen', 'Xixi Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['Zinc finger C3H1-type containing serves as a novel prognostic biomarker in human pan-cancer.', 'Database Mining of Genes of Prognostic Value for the Prostate Adenocarcinoma Microenvironment Using the Cancer Gene Atlas.', 'Identification of Prognostic Biomarkers Associated with Cancer Stem Cell Features in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Nur77 Serves as a Potential Prognostic Biomarker That Correlates with Immune Infiltration and May Act as a Good Target for Prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Immune infiltration phenotypes of prostate adenocarcinoma and their clinical implications.', 'Zinc in Prostate Health and Disease: A Mini Review.', 'Proteomic analysis reveals zinc-finger CCHC-type containing protein 3 as a factor inhibiting virus infection by promoting innate signaling.']"""

This recognition has led to publication of cardio-oncological guidelines and to the widespread adoption of dedicated cardio-oncology services in many institutes. However, it is unclear whether there has been a change in the incidence of CV death in cancer patients.  Methods and results:   Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging, Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC WONDER) Multiple Cause of Death dataset, we determined national trends in age-standardised mortality rates attributed to cardiovascular diseases in patients with and without cancer, from 1999 to 2019, stratified by cancer type, age, gender, race, and place of residence (state and urbanisation status). Among more than 17.8 million cardiovascular deaths in the United States, 13.6% were patients with a concomitant cancer diagnosis. During the study period, among patients with cancer, the age-adjusted mortality rate dropped by 52% (vs 38% in patients with no cancer). In cancer patients, age-adjusted mortality rate dropped more significantly among patients with gastrointestinal, breast, and prostate malignancy than among patients with haematological malignancy (59%-63% vs. 41%). Similar reduction was observed in both genders (53%-54%), but more prominent reduction was observed in older patients and in those living in metro areas.

Background:   Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed male malignancy in recent years. With surgical treatments, patients with prostate cancer indeed have satisfying survival rate. However, the presence of postprostatectomy lower urinary tract symptoms which affect quality of life significantly is more worthy of attention.  Design:   Patients underwent surgical therapies were followed up and the symptoms were recorded.  Methods:   A total of 65 prostate cancer patients underwent radical prostatectomy from January 2019 to October 2020, and pathologically diagnosed with prostate cancer were enrolled in our study. These patients were followed up 3 months after surgery and their medical records were retrospectively collected and analysed. Results were reported according to the STROBE Statement.  Results:   The incidence of post-operative lower urinary tract symptoms at 3 months after surgery is similar to that of pre-operation. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the independent risk factor for postprostatectomy lower urinary tract symptoms is body mass index, whereas pelvic floor muscle exercise is a protective factor.  Conclusions:   The incidence of postprostatectomy lower urinary tract symptoms is non-negligible, which significantly affects quality of life. Body mass index is found as an independent risk factor for postprostatectomy lower urinary tract symptoms, while pelvic floor muscle exercise is a strong protector.

To improve our understanding of the epigenetic abnormalities in prostate-related diseases, it is important to use the epigenome of normal prostate as a reference. Although previous efforts have provided critical insights into the genetic and transcriptomic features of the normal prostate, a comprehensive epigenome map has been lacking. To address this need, we conducted a Roadmap Epigenomics legacy project integrating six histone marks (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K36me3, H3K27me3, and H3K27ac) with complete DNA methylome, transcriptome, and chromatin accessibility data to produce a comprehensive epigenome map of normal prostate tissue. Our epigenome map is composed of 18 chromatin states each with unique signatures of DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and gene expression. This map provides a high-resolution comprehensive annotation of regulatory regions of the prostate, including 105,593 enhancer and 70,481 promoter elements, which account for 5.3% of the genome. By comparing with other epigenomes, we identified 7,580 prostate-specific active enhancers associated with prostate development. Epigenomic annotation of GWAS SNPs associated with prostate cancers revealed that two out of nine SNPs within prostate enhancer regions destroyed putative androgen receptor (AR) binding motif. A notable SNP rs17694493, might decouple AR's repressive effect on CDKN2B-AS1 and cell cycle regulation, thereby playing a causal role in predisposing cancer risk.

Methods:   The dataset of mRNA/miRNA transcriptome sequencing was downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas/the Gene Expression Omnibus database for analysis. The ""edgeR"" package in the R environment was used to normalize and analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEmiRNAs). First, the PANTHER online tool was used to analyze the function enrichment of DEGs. Next, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using STRING and Cytoscape tools. Finally, miRNA-gene regulatory networks were constructed using the miRTarBase.  Results:   We identified 4339 important DEGs, of which 2145 were upregulated (Up-DEGs) and 2194 were downregulated (Down-DEGs). Functional enrichment analysis showed that the Up-DEGs were related to the immune system and the cell cycle in prostate cancer, whereas the Down-DEGs were related to the nucleic acid metabolic process and metabolism pathways. Twelve core protein clusters were found in the PPI network. Further, the constructed miRNA-gene interaction network showed that 11 downregulated miRNAs regulated 16 Up-DEGs and 22 upregulated miRNAs regulated 22 Down-DEGs.  Conclusion:   We identified 4339 genes and 70 miRNAs that may be involved in immune response, cell cycle, and other key pathways of the prostate cancer regulatory network.

Some of the established risk factors of HDC include unhealthy lifestyles, environmental factors, and genetic influences. Numerous studies have been conducted to understand gene-cancer associations. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrate data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci - eQTL) to yield meaningful information on biological pathways associated with complex traits/diseases. Recently, TWAS have enabled the identification of novel associations between HDC risk and protein-coding genes.  Methods:   In the present study, we performed a TWAS analysis using the summary data-based Mendelian randomization (SMR)-heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) method to identify microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) associated with HDC risk. We obtained eQTL and GWAS summary statistics from the ncRNA-eQTL database and the National Human Genome Research Institute-European Bioinformatics Institute (NHGRI-EBI) GWAS Catalog.  Results:   We identified 13 TWAS-significant miRNAs at cis regions (±1 Mb) associated with HDC risk (two, five, one, two, and three miRNAs for prostate, breast, ovarian, colorectal, and endometrial cancers, respectively). Among them, eight novel miRNAs were recognized in HDC risk. Eight protein-coding genes targeted by TWAS-identified miRNAs (SIRT1, SOX4, RUNX2, FOXA1, ABL2, SUB1, HNRNPH1, and WAC) are associated with HDC functions and signaling pathways.  Conclusion:   Overall, identifying risk-associated miRNAs across a group of related cancers may help to understand cancer biology and provide novel insights into cancer genetic mechanisms.

It is known that N-cadherin becomes upregulated following ADT and can directly induce PCa transformation to the castration-resistant stage (CRPC). However, the relationship between AR and N-cadherin is unclear and may promote better understanding of CRPC pathogenesis and progression. Here, we demonstrate a new axis of N-cadherin/c-Jun/N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) that N-cadherin promotes c-Jun expression and suppresses NDRG1 to promote invasion and migration of PCa cells through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Targeting N-cadherin in combination with enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment synergistically suppressed PC3 cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Further studies showed that compared to lower Gleason score (GS) (GS < 7) cases, high GS (GS > 7) cases exhibited elevated N-cadherin expression and reduced NDRG1 expression, corroborating our in vitro observations. We further demonstrate that c-Jun, AR, and DNA methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1) form a complex in the 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) response elements (TREs) region of the NDRG1 promoter, which suppresses NDRG1 transcription through DNA hypermethylation.

Objective:   This study aimed to estimate how many cancer patients continue working in the month after the diagnosis in an Italian context and to determine which factors affect the decision to stop working in the same period.  Methods:   One hundred seventy-six patients with breast, gastrointestinal, prostate, or female reproductive system cancer completed a survey with demographic, occupational, and psychosocial information. Clinical information was collected from medical records. We measured how many workers continued working in the month after cancer diagnosis without substantial interruptions and selected the best logistic regression model of this behavior's predictors.  Results:   Sixty-eight percent of the patients continued working in the month after the diagnosis.

Meanwhile, reduction in TPV at the time of TPPB was comparable between both arms (p = 0.128). There were also no significant between-arm differences in the International Prostate Symptom Score and the International Index of Erectile Function scores.  Discussion and conclusion:   The recovery patterns of hormonal profiles after short-term (12 weeks) neoadjuvant ADT differ between GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists.

Methods:   All PCa cases diagnosed in 1960-2017 were extracted from the Cancer Registry of Norway. Firefighters, military employees, pilots and police officers were identified through occupational data from Statistics Norway. Age at diagnosis, clinical stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score, performance status and overall survival and PCa-specific survival in cases in these occupations were compared with cases in the general population.  Results:   Firefighters were significantly younger at PCa diagnosis than cases in the general population in 1960-1993 (mean difference: 2.1 years) and 2007-2017 (mean difference: 4.3 years). At diagnosis, firefighters had significantly lower PSA values, Gleason scores and performance status scores than the general population. Firefighters diagnosed in 2007-2017 had lower risk of all-cause death than the general population (crude HR 0.71 (0.53-0.95)). No difference remained after adjusting for age at diagnosis (HR 1.03 (0.77-1.37)). Firefighters were older at diagnosis in 1994-2006 (mean difference: 3.0 years), but showed no other significant differences in age at diagnosis, PSA values, Gleason scores or performance status compared with military employees, pilots and police officers.

Methods:   The electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry was applied to quantitate prostatic lipids in human and mouse PCa and non-cancer prostatic tissues. Biostatistics and bioinformatics were used to compare the concentrations of prostatic lipids at levels of total lipid, group, class and individual species between PCa and benign prostatic tissues, between races, and among pathological conditions of PCa.  Results:   Prostatic concentrations of total lipids as well as neutral lipids were significantly higher in PCa than in benign prostatic tissues in all population and Caucasian American population, but not in African American population. The prostatic phospholipid were not statistically different between PCa and benign prostatic tissues in all study populations. Cholesteryl ester is the only lipid class significantly higher in PCa than in benign prostatic tissues in all study populations. A panel of prostatic lipid parameters in each study population was identified as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers with >60% of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy simultaneously. Lipid profiling on mouse prostatic tissues further confirmed correlation of prostatic lipid profiles to the pathogenesis and progression of PCa. In addition, a few prostatic lipids in mouse can serve as prognostic biomarkers in differentiation of indolent from aggressive PCa.

However, how SPOP mutations regulate prostate tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here, we report the identification of cell division cycle associated 5 (CDCA5) as a SPOP substrate. We found that SPOP interacts with CDCA5 and promotes its polyubiquitin degradation in a degron-dependent manner. This effect was greatly impaired by introducing PCa associated SPOP mutations. Importantly, we found that CDCA5 was essential for PCa cells to survive and proliferate. CDCA5 depletion in PCa cells led to cessation of proliferation, G2M arrest, severe sister chromatid aggregation disturbance, and apoptosis. we also found that CDCA5 knockdown decreased the protein expression of p-GSK3β, increased the activity of caspase-3, caspase-9, and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Besides, we confirmed that CDCA5 interrupted cancer cell behavior via the AKT pathway. In contrast, silencing SPOP or overexpressing CDCA5 increased cell proliferation. Consistently, depleting SPOP along with CDCA5, or overexpressing CDCA5 along with SPOP also caused the growth of cells repressed. Consistent with the functional role of CDCA5, the mRNA and protein levels of CDCA5 were significantly increased in PCa, compared to normal tissues, and its high expression was associated with more severe lymph node metastasis, higher Gleason score, and poorer prognosis. Together, our data showed that SPOP plays a crucial role in inhibiting tumorigenesis and partly achieved this by promoting the degradation of oncoprotein CDCA5.""","""['Zhenzhen Luo', 'Jing Wang', 'Yue Zhu', 'Xiao Sun', 'Chenchen He', 'Mengjiao Cai', 'Jinlu Ma', 'Yi Wang', 'Suxia Han']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Mutated SPOP E3 Ligase Promotes 17βHSD4 Protein Degradation to Drive Androgenesis and Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'CDCA5 promotes the progression of prostate cancer by affecting the ERK signalling pathway.', 'SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PDK1 suppresses AKT kinase activity and oncogenic functions.', 'The diverse roles of SPOP in prostate cancer and kidney cancer.', 'The ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP in cancer.', 'The Comprehensive Analysis Illustrates the Role of CDCA5 in Breast Cancer: An Effective Diagnosis and Prognosis Biomarker.', 'YAP-mediated mechanotransduction in urinary bladder remodeling: Based on RNA-seq and CUT&Tag.', 'Identification of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes with hepatocellular carcinoma: A comprehensive analysis based on TCGA and GEO datasets.', 'Prognostic and Immunological Roles of Cell Cycle Regulator CDCA5 in Human Solid Tumors.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the MarketScan claims databases (1 January 2013 to 30 September 2018) to identify adults with diagnosis of metastatic PC who received treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and novel antiandrogen agents (abiraterone or enzalutamide). The primary CV outcome measure was composite outcome of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Secondary outcomes were individual risks of MI or stroke. We used an intention-to-treat approach to analyze the CV outcomes associated with drug exposure among patients with metastatic PC. Cox regression model was used to estimate the independent association of two drugs with CV risk after adjustment for age, baseline atrial fibrillation, and Charlson Comorbidity Index.  Results:   A total of 6294 patients with metastatic PC who were treated with ADT and either abiraterone or enzalutamide were included in the final analysis. Of these, 4017 (63.8%) patients used abiraterone and 2217 (32.2%) patients used enzalutamide. During the study period, 255 (6.3%) primary endpoint events occurred, resulting in an incidence rate of 4.3 per 100 patient-years. In multivariable analysis, abiraterone use was associated with a 31% increased risk of MI or stroke compared to enzalutamide (hazard ratio 1.31; 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.63; P = 0.01). The incidence rate was similar in patients who switched initial therapy from abiraterone to enzalutamide or vice versa (5.0 versus 5.6 per 100 patient-years, respectively).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first real-world assessment of MI and stroke among metastatic PC patients receiving novel anti-androgens. Our findings of increased MI and stroke risk with abiraterone compared with enzalutamide are consistent with data from clinical trials and suggest that enzalutamide may be preferable for prostate cancer patients at high CV risk.""","""['A A Kulkarni', 'N Rubin', 'A Tholkes', 'S Shah', 'C J Ryan', 'P L Lutsey', 'A Prizment', 'A Rao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""ESMO Open""","""['Quality of life in patients with metastatic prostate cancer following treatment with cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide (CARD): an analysis of a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 4 study.', 'HSD3B1 (1245A>C) germline variant and clinical outcomes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone and enzalutamide: results from two prospective studies.', 'Efficacy of Novel Hormone Agents in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Real-world Retrospective Study.', 'Lower Fracture Rates in Patients Treated with Radium-223, Abiraterone or Enzalutamide, When Given Concurrently with Bone Health Agents: A Real-World Analysis.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, prostate cancer, and older adults: a global Young International Society of Geriatric Oncology drug review.', 'Functional impact of androgen-targeted therapy on patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Survival of veterans treated with enzalutamide and abiraterone for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer based on comorbid diseases.', 'Second generation androgen receptor antagonists and challenges in prostate cancer treatment.']"""

In general, hybrids with an ester linker containing 4-hydroxypiplartine (4) were more potent than the corresponding hybrids with 4-hydroxygoniothalamin (2). On the other hand, compounds presenting the 1,2,3-triazole linker displayed enhanced cytotoxicity and selectivity when compared to their corresponding hybrids with the diester linker. The 4-hydroxypiplartine-based hybrids 12 and 22 displayed high cytotoxicity (IC50 values below 10 μM) against all cancer cells studied, especially in MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 1.7 ± 0.1 and 1.6 ± 0.9 μM, respectively.

Methods:   We identified 26,548 men initially managed with AS aged <80 years, with clinically localized prostate cancer (cT1-2cN0M0), PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL, biopsy GG ≤ 2 with percent positive cores ≤33% and who converted to treatment with radical prostatectomy from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results prostate with the watchful waiting database.

Methods:   Person-time accruals began 6 months after enrolment into a WTC cohort and ended at death or 12/31/2015. Cancer data were obtained through linkages with 13 state cancer registries. New York State was the comparison population. We used Poisson regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% CIs; change points in rate ratios were estimated using profile likelihood.  Results:   The analytic cohort included 54 394 male rescue/recovery workers. We observed 1120 incident prostate cancer cases. During 2002-2006, no association with WTC exposure was detected. Beginning in 2007, a 24% increased risk (HR: 1.24, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.32) was observed among WTC rescue/recovery workers when compared with New York State.

Methods:   FDNY (N=10 786) and CFHS (N=8813) cohorts included male firefighters who were active on 11 September 2001 (9/11) and were followed until death or 31 December 2016.

To improve the data applicability, each dataset was standardized and annotated with relevant clinical information. All of the 13 analytic functions allow users to group samples based on their clinical data and assign different parameters for different analyses, and enable them to perform these analyses using their own circRNA transcriptomes. Moreover, three additional tools were developed in circMine to systematically discover the circRNA-miRNA interaction and circRNA translatability. For example, we systematically discovered five potential translatable circRNAs associated with prostate cancer progression using circMine. In summary, circMine provides user-friendly web interfaces to browse, search, analyze and download data freely, and submit new data for further integration, and it can be an important resource to discover significant circRNA in different diseases.""","""['Wenliang Zhang', 'Yang Liu', 'Zhuochao Min', 'Guodong Liang', 'Jing Mo', 'Zhen Ju', 'Binghui Zeng', 'Wen Guan', 'Yan Zhang', 'Jianliang Chen', 'Qianshen Zhang', 'Hanguang Li', 'Chunxia Zeng', 'Yanjie Wei', 'Godfrey Chi-Fung Chan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['COVID19db: a comprehensive database platform to discover potential drugs and targets of COVID-19 at whole transcriptomic scale.', 'Database Resources for Functional Circular RNAs.', 'riboCIRC: a comprehensive database of translatable circRNAs.', 'Circular RNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'The bioinformatics toolbox for circRNA discovery and analysis.', 'GDCL-NcDA: identifying non-coding RNA-disease associations via contrastive learning between deep graph learning and deep matrix factorization.', 'Emerging roles and potential clinical applications of translatable circular RNAs in cancer and other human diseases.', 'Circular RNAs-New Kids on the Block in Cancer Pathophysiology and Management.', 'Biological functions and potential implications of circular RNAs.', 'FAS-mediated circRNA-miRNA-mRNA Crosstalk Network Regulates Immune Cell Infiltration in Cerebral Infarction.']"""

However, their construction depends on the availability of summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) independent from the target sample. For best compatibility, it was reported that GWAS and the target sample should match in terms of ancestries. Yet, GWAS, especially in the field of cancer, often lack diversity and are predominated by European ancestry. This bias is a limiting factor in PRS research. By using electronic health records and genetic data from the UK Biobank, we contrast the utility of breast and prostate cancer PRS derived from external European-ancestry-based GWAS across African, East Asian, European, and South Asian ancestry groups. We highlight differences in the PRS distributions of these groups that are amplified when PRS methods condense hundreds of thousands of variants into a single score. While European-GWAS-derived PRS were not directly transferrable across ancestries on an absolute scale, we establish their predictive potential when considering them separately within each group. For example, the top 10% of the breast cancer PRS distributions within each ancestry group each revealed significant enrichments of breast cancer cases compared to the bottom 90% (odds ratio of 2.81 [95%CI: 2.69,2.93] in European, 2.88 [1.85, 4.48] in African, 2.60 [1.25, 5.40] in East Asian, and 2.33 [1.55, 3.51] in South Asian individuals).

Non-Caucasian males are underrepresented in most prostate cancer databases. We evaluated the variation in performance of a machine learning (ML) algorithm trained to predict survival after radical prostatectomy in race subgroups.  Methods:   We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to identify patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2004 and 2016. We grouped patients by race into Caucasian, African-American, or non-Caucasian, non-African-American (NCNAA) subgroups. We trained an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) classifier to predict 5-year survival in different training samples: naturally race-imbalanced, race-specific, and synthetically race-balanced. We evaluated performance in the test sets.  Results:   A total of 68,630 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 57,635 (84%) were Caucasian, 8173 (12%) were African-American, and 2822 (4%) were NCNAA. For the classifier trained in the naturally race-imbalanced sample, the F1 scores were 0.514 (95% confidence interval: 0.513-0.511), 0.511 (0.511-0.512), 0.545 (0.541-0.548), and 0.378 (0.378-0.389) in the race-imbalanced, Caucasian, African-American, and NCNAA test samples, respectively. For all race subgroups, the F1 scores of classifiers trained in the race-specific or synthetically race-balanced samples demonstrated similar performance compared to training in the naturally race-imbalanced sample.  Conclusions:   A ML algorithm trained using NCDB data to predict survival after radical prostatectomy demonstrates variation in performance by race, regardless of whether the algorithm is trained in a naturally race-imbalanced, race-specific, or synthetically race-balanced sample. These results emphasize the importance of thoroughly evaluating ML algorithms in race subgroups before clinical deployment to avoid potential disparities in care.""","""['Madhur Nayan', 'Keyan Salari', 'Anthony Bozzo', 'Wolfgang Ganglberger', 'Filipe Carvalho', 'Adam S Feldman', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Application of a novel machine learning framework for predicting non-metastatic prostate cancer-specific mortality in men using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.', 'Nomogram Predicting Prostate Cancer-specific Mortality for Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Facility-Level Variation in Pelvic Lymphadenectomy During Radical Prostatectomy and Effect on Overall Survival in Men with High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Cytoreductive prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

While socioeconomic status has been implicated as a driver of this disparity, little is known about the genomic mechanisms and distinct biological pathways that are associated with PCa of native men of African origin.  Methods:   To understand biological factors that contribute to this disparity we utilized a total of 406 multi-institutional localized PCa samples, collected by Men of African Descent and Carcinoma of the Prostate biospecimen network and Moffitt Cancer Center/University of Pennsylvania Health science system. We performed comparative genomics and immunohistochemistry to identify the biomarkers that are highly enriched in NAM from west Africa and compared them with African American Men (AAM) and EAM. Quantified messenger RNA expression and Median H scores based on immune reactivity of staining cells, were compared using Mann Whitney test. For gene expression analysis, p values were further adjusted for multiple comparisons using false discovery rates.  Results:   Immunohistochemical analysis on selected biomarkers showed a consistent association between ETS related gene (ERG) status and race with 83% of NAM exhibiting tumors that lacked TMPRSS2-ERG translocation (ERGnegative ) as compared to AAM (71%) and EAM (52%). A higher proportion of NAM (29%) were also found to be double negative (ERGnegative and PTENLoss ) as compared to AAM (6%) and EAM (7%). NAM tumors had significantly higher immunoreactivity (H-score) for PSMA, and EZH2, whereas they have lower H-score for PTEN, MYC, AR, RB and Racemase, (all p < .05). Comparative genomics revealed that NAM had significant transcriptomic variability in AR-activity score. In pathways enrichment analysis NAM tumors exhibited the enrichment of proinflammatory pathways including cytokine, interleukins, inflammatory response, and nuclear factor kappa B signaling.  Conclusions:   Prostate tumors in NAM are genomically distinct and are characterized by the dysregulation of several biomarkers. Furthermore, these tumors are also highly enriched for the major proinflammatory pathways.

Design, setting, and participants:   This investigator-initiated prospective multicenter single-arm open-label phase 3 imaging trial of diagnostic efficacy enrolled 764 patients with intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer considered for prostatectomy at University of California, San Francisco and University of California, Los Angeles from December 2015 to December 2019. Data analysis took place from October 2018 to July 2021.  Interventions:   Imaging scan with 3 to 7 mCi of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was the sensitivity and specificity for the detection pelvic lymph nodes compared with histopathology on a per-patient basis using nodal region correlation. Each scan was read centrally by 3 blinded independent central readers, and a majority rule was used for analysis.  Results:   A total of 764 men (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [63-73] years) underwent 1 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging scan for primary staging, and 277 of 764 (36%) subsequently underwent prostatectomy with lymph node dissection (efficacy analysis cohort). Based on pathology reports, 75 of 277 patients (27%) had pelvic nodal metastasis. Results of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET were positive in 40 of 277 (14%), 2 of 277 (1%), and 7 of 277 (3%) of patients for pelvic nodal, extrapelvic nodal, and bone metastatic disease.

Methods:   In this retrospective study, 133 PCa patients in our center were treated by SBRT with CyberKnife (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, USA) from October 2012 to July 2019. Follow-up was performed every 3 months for efficacy and toxicity evaluation. Biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) and toxicities were assessed using the Phoenix definition and the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0, respectively. Factors predictive of bPFS were identified with COX regression analysis.  Results:   133 patients (10 low-, 21 favorable intermediate-, 31 unfavorable intermediate-, 45 high-, and 26 very high risk cases on the basis of NCCN risk classification) with a median age of 76 years (range 54-87 years) received SBRT.

Systemic chemotherapy after surgery is associated with significant toxicity. Improved delivery methods for toxic drugs capable of targeting positive resection margins can reduce tumor recurrence and avoid their known toxicity. This study evaluates the effectiveness and toxicity of docetaxel (DTX) release from highly porous biodegradable microparticles intended for delivery into the tissue cavity created during radical prostatectomy to target residual tumor cells. The microparticles, composed of poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), are processed using thermally induced phase separation (TIPS) and loaded with DTX via antisolvent precipitation. Sustained drug release and effective toxicity in vitro are observed against PC3 human prostate cells. Peritumoral injection in a PC3 xenograft tumor model results in tumor growth inhibition equivalent to that achieved with intravenous delivery of DTX. Unlike intravenous delivery of DTX, implantation of DTX-TIPS microparticles is not accompanied by toxicity or elevated systemic levels of DTX in organ tissues or plasma. DTX-TIPS microparticles provide localized and sustained release of nontoxic therapeutic amounts of DTX. This may offer novel therapeutic strategies for improving management of patients with clinically localized high-risk disease requiring radical prostatectomy and other solid cancers at high risk of positive resection margins.""","""['Ketevan Paliashvili', 'Alexander Popov', 'Tammy L Kalber', 'P Stephen Patrick', 'Angela Hayes', 'Alan Henley', 'Florence I Raynaud', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Richard M Day']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Adv Ther (Weinh)""","""['A novel adjuvant drug-device combination tissue scaffold for radical prostatectomy.', 'Exploring the Promising Potential of High Permeation Vesicle-Mediated Localized Transdermal Delivery of Docetaxel in Breast Cancer To Overcome the Limitations of Systemic Chemotherapy.', 'Development of novel PLGA nanoparticles with co-encapsulation of docetaxel and abiraterone acetate for a highly efficient delivery into tumor cells.', 'LHRH-conjugated, PEGylated, poly-lactide-co-glycolide nanocapsules for targeted delivery of combinational chemotherapeutic drugs Docetaxel and Quercetin for prostate cancer.', 'Facile fabrication of robust, hyaluronic acid-surfaced and disulfide-crosslinked PLGA nanoparticles for tumor-targeted and reduction-triggered release of docetaxel.']"""

Here, a pan-cancer analysis was performed to analyze the role of Cdc20 in various human cancers. Our results indicated that the expression levels of the CDC20 gene were significantly elevated in bladder cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, rectum cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, kidney cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and uterine cancer. In addition, the expression of CDC20 was significantly and positively correlated with the increase of clinical stages in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, kidney cancer, and lung cancer, et al. Among 33 cancer subtypes in the TCGA dataset, the high expression of CDC20 was correlated with poor prognosis in 10 cancer types. Furthermore, the abundance of phosphorylated Cdc20 in the primary tumor was elevated and correlated with increased tumor grade. Next, we sought to elucidate the oncogenic role by analyzing its association with immune infiltration. For most cancer types, the CDC20 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of cancer-associated fibroblasts and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. To further understand its functional activity, we explored the classic Cdc20 downstream substrates, which were found to be mutually exclusive with the expression of Cdc20. Moreover, the pan-cancer analysis of the molecular function of Cdc20 indicated that BUB1, CCNA2, CCNB1, CDK1, MAD2L1, and PLK1 might play a critical role in interaction with Cdc20. The abundance of Cdc20 was further validated at transcriptional and translational levels with a publicly available dataset and clinical tumor tissues. The knockdown of Cdc20 dramatically inhibited tumor growth both in vivo and in vitro. Therefore, our studies delineated the oncogenic role of CDC20 and its prognostic significance at the pan-cancer level and proved its functional activity in Cdc20 high expression cancer types. Our studies will merits further molecular assays to understand the potential role of Cdc20 in tumorigenesis and provide the rationale for developing novel therapeutic strategies.""","""['Fei Wu', 'Yang Sun', 'Jie Chen', 'Hongyun Li', 'Kang Yao', 'Yongjun Liu', 'Qingyong Liu', 'Jiaju Lu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['The panoramic picture of pepsinogen gene family with pan-cancer.', 'Bioinformatical Analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus Database Associates TAF7/CCNB1, TAF7/CCNA2, and GTF2E2/CDC20 Pathways with Glioblastoma Development and Prognosis.', 'Overexpression of BUB1B, CCNA2, CDC20, and CDK1 in tumor tissues predicts poor survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Targeting Cdc20 as a novel cancer therapeutic strategy.', 'The spindle checkpoint: how do cells delay anaphase onset?', 'CDC20 promotes radioresistance of prostate cancer by activating Twist1 expression.', 'Inhibition of CDC20 potentiates anti-tumor immunity through facilitating GSDME-mediated pyroptosis in prostate cancer.', 'CDC20 Is Regulated by the Histone Methyltransferase, KMT5A, in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CCNB1 is involved in bladder cancer pathogenesis and silencing CCNB1 decelerates tumor growth and improves prognosis of bladder cancer.', 'Epigenetic reprogramming of cell cycle genes by ACK1 promotes breast cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor.']"""

Previously, convolutional neural networks such as the U-Net have been used to produce fully automatic multi-zonal prostate segmentation on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) with performance comparable to human experts, but these often require large amounts of manually segmented training data to produce acceptable results. For institutions that have limited amounts of labeled MRI exams, it is not clear how much data is needed to train a segmentation model, and which training strategy should be used to maximize the value of the available data. This work compares how the strategies of transfer learning and aggregated training using publicly available external data can improve segmentation performance on internal, site-specific prostate MR images, and evaluates how the performance varies with the amount of internal data used for training. Cross training experiments were performed to show that differences between internal and external data were impactful. Using a standard U-Net architecture, optimizations were performed to select between 2D and 3D variants, and to determine the depth of fine-tuning required for optimal transfer learning. With the optimized architecture, the performance of transfer learning and aggregated training were compared for a range of 5-40 internal datasets. The results show that both strategies consistently improve performance and produced segmentation results that are comparable to that of human experts with approximately 20 site-specific MRI datasets.

Possible adverse events after therapy were retrospectively classified according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with OS.  Results:   A total of 112 cycles of PRLT with a median of 3 cycles (range: 1-6) and median administered activity per cycle of 6.29 GBq (range: 4.45-7.7 GBq) were used.

While the mainstay treatment is erectile aids (EAs) to promote erectile recovery, some men never use these treatments and those whose do use EAs often abandon them in the long-term.  Aim:   The goal of this study was to examine PCa patients' experiences with EAs, to elucidate relationships between experiences with EAs on psychological and sexual well-being, and to explore benefits and drawbacks to EA use.  Methods:   A self-report survey including validated questionnaires was administered to examine PCa patients' use and perceptions of helpfulness of EAs, and to characterize associations between use, perceived helpfulness, and psychological and sexual well-being. The survey was followed by an open-ended prompt to explore participants' experiences with EAs.  Outcomes:   We surveyed 260 North American men, up to 25 years after receiving treatment for PCa. Three groups of patients were observed, including those who used EAs and perceived them to be helpful, those who used EAs and perceived them to be unhelpful, as well as a smaller group of patients who never used EAs.  Results:   Around 80% of the sample were using or had used EAs. Despite the high frequency of use, not all men found EAs helpful. Men who used EAs and found them unhelpful reported poorer psychological and sexual well-being compared to men who didn't use aids or who used EAs but found them helpful. Results indicated both benefits and drawbacks to the use of EAs. Benefits related largely to the efficacy of the aid in promoting erections. A wide range of drawbacks were also reported.  Clinical implications:   Given the negative sexual and psychological impacts associated with using EAs and finding them unhelpful, we suggest that researchers and health care providers should take care to proactively address potential challenges that are common with EA use, and also to consider the risks of failed attempts with EAs.  Strengths & limitations:   By using both scaled and open-ended questions, a more nuanced picture of the relative benefits and limitations of EA use within the PCa population is presented. As responses were not mandatory, a subset of participants provided comments about the use of EAs. Additionally, the sample was quite homogenous, with mostly white, American and well-educated participants, so it therefore lacks generalizability to other populations.  Conclusion:   This paper illustrates several challenges to EA use, while providing insight into reasons for abandonment of use of EAs. Walker LM, Sears CS, Santos-Iglesias P, et al.

Besides, eIFs are especially important in regulating the immune function of tumor cells. However, the effect mechanism of eIFs in prostate cancer remains to be studied, which is precisely the purpose of this study.  Methods:   In this study, three groups of prostate cancer cells were investigated. One group had its eIF5B gene knocked down; another group had its Programmed death 1 (PD-L1) overexpressed; the final group had its Wild-type p53-induced gene 1 (Wig1) overexpressed. Genetic alterations of the cancer cells were performed by plasmid transfection. The expression of PD-L1 mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and the expressions of PD-L1 and eIF5B proteins were observed by western blot assays. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, Transwell and Transwell martrigel were used to investigated cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion, respectively. The effect of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) on tumor cells was observed, and the interaction between eIF5B and Wig1 was revealed by co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) assay. Finally, the effects of interference with eIF5B expression on the growth, morphology, and immunity of the tumor, as well as PD-L1 expression in the tumor, were verified by tumor xenograft assays in vivo.  Results:   Compared with normal prostate epithelial cells, prostate cancer cells revealed higher expressions of eIF5B and PD-L1 interference with eIF-5B expression can inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and PD-L1 expression of prostate cancer cells. Meanwhile, the cancer cell group with interference with eIF5B expression also demonstrated greater, apoptosis and higher vulnerability to PBMCs. CoIP assays showed that Wig1 could bind to eIF5B in prostate cancer cells, and its overexpression can inhibit the proliferation, migration, invasion and PD-L1 expression of cancer cells while promoting apoptosis. Moreover, interference with eIF5B expression can inhibit tumor growth, destroy tumor morphology, and suppress the proliferation of tumor cells.

The cancer survival index (CSI) is superior to age standardization in measuring such progress.  Data and methods:   Data are from the population-based Canadian Cancer Registry, record-linked to the Canadian Vital Statistics Death database. CSI estimates for both sexes combined were calculated as the weighted sum of the sex- and cancer-specific age-standardized net survival estimates. Sex-specific CSI estimates were calculated separately using sex-specific cancer type weights.  Results:   From the 1992-to-1994 period to the 2015-to-2017 period, the five-year CSI increased 8.6 percentage points to 63.7%. It increased by 8.9 percentage points to 61.8% among males, and by 8.2 percentage points to 65.8% among females. The contribution of a cancer and sex combination to change in the CSI over time is a function of its assigned weight and changes in its age-standardized net survival. Female breast was the most influential cancer and sex combination, contributing 10.1% to the overall increase, followed by prostate (8.2%) and female lung (7.3%). The increase in the index since the 2005-to-2007 period was most impacted by lung cancer among both females (11.1%) and males (9.4%). While prostate cancer survival increased over the entire study period, it has recently decreased, resulting in a counterproductive 8.1% contribution since the 2005-to-2007 period.  Interpretation:   Steady progress has been made in overall cancer survival in Canada since the early 1990s. Female breast cancer has contributed the most to this progress overall, but more recently female lung cancer has been the most influential.""","""['Larry F Ellison']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Health Rep""","""['Measuring progress in cancer survival across Canadian provinces: Extending the cancer survival index to further evaluate cancer control efforts.', 'Progress in net cancer survival in Canada over 20 years.', 'Five-year cancer survival by stage at diagnosis in Canada.', 'Construction of a North American Cancer Survival Index to Measure Progress of Cancer Control Efforts.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'The Impact of Organised Screening Programs on Breast Cancer Stage at Diagnosis for Canadian Women Aged 40-49 and 50-59.', 'Projected estimates of cancer in Canada in 2022.']"""

However, real-world data validating this effect within large-scale epidemiological data sets are scarce. We addressed this void.  Materials and methods:   Men with de novo mPCa were identified and systemic chemotherapy status was ascertained within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016). Patients were divided between historical (2004-2013) versus contemporary (2014-2016). Chemotherapy rates were plotted over time. Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression models with additional multivariable adjustments addressed overall and cancer-specific mortality. All tests were repeated in propensity-matched analyses.  Results:   Overall, 19,913 patients had de novo mPCa between 2004 and 2016. Of those, 1838 patients received chemotherapy. Of 1838 chemotherapy-exposed patients, 903 were historical, whereas 905 were contemporary. Chemotherapy rates increased from 5% to 25% over time. Median overall survival was not reached in contemporary patients versus was 24 months in historical patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.55, p < 0.001). After propensity score matching and additional multivariable adjustment (age, prostate-specific antigen, GGG, cT-stage, cN-stage, cM-stage, and local treatment) a HR of 0.55 (p < 0.001) was recorded. Analyses were repeated for cancer-specific mortality after adjustment for other cause mortality in competing risks regression models and recorded virtually the same findings before and after propensity score matching (HR: 0.55, p < 0.001).

We previously reported that monoethanolamine (Etn), an orally deliverable lipid formulation, reduced intracellular glucose and glutamine levels in prostate cancer (PCa). Glucose deprivation upon Etn treatment exacerbated metabolic stress in PCa, thereby enhancing cell death. Moreover, Etn was potent in inhibiting tumor growth in a PCa xenograft model. However, the precise mechanisms underlying Etn-induced metabolic stress in PCa remain elusive. The purpose of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to Etn-mediated metabolic rewiring in PCa. Methods: Glucose transporters (GLUTs) facilitate glucose transport across the plasma membrane. Thus, we assessed the expression of GLUTs and the internalization of GLUT1 in PCa. We also evaluated the effects of Etn on membrane dynamics, mitochondrial structure and function, lipid droplet density, autophagy, and apoptosis in PCa cells. Results: Compared to other GLUTs, GLUT1 was highly upregulated in PCa. We observed enhanced GLUT1 internalization, altered membrane dynamics, and perturbed mitochondrial structure and function upon Etn treatment. Etn-induced bioenergetic stress enhanced lipolysis, decreased lipid droplet density, promoted accumulation of autophagosomes, and increased apoptosis. Conclusion: We provide the first evidence that Etn alters GLUT1 trafficking leading to metabolic stress in PCa. By upregulating phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), Etn modulates membrane fluidity and affects mitochondrial structure and function. Etn also induces autophagy in PCa cells, thereby promoting apoptosis. These data strongly suggest that Etn rewires cellular bioenergetics and could serve as a promising anticancer agent for PCa.""","""['Chakravarthy Garlapati', 'Shriya Joshi', 'Ravi Chakra Turaga', 'Manjari Mishra', 'Michelle D Reid', 'Shobhna Kapoor', 'Liana Artinian', 'Vincent Rehder', 'Ritu Aneja']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Preclinical Development of a Nontoxic Oral Formulation of Monoethanolamine, a Lipid Precursor, for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'GLUT1 protects prostate cancer cells from glucose deprivation-induced oxidative stress.', 'Inhibition of EGFR signaling with Spautin-1 represents a novel therapeutics for prostate cancer.', 'The dark side of glucose transporters in prostate cancer: Are they a new feature to characterize carcinomas?', 'Glucose transporters regulation on ischemic brain: possible role as therapeutic target.', 'Enhanced apoptosis of HCT116 colon cancer cells treated with extracts from Calotropis gigantea stem bark by starvation.', 'PLK1 and AURKB phosphorylate survivin differentially to affect proliferation in racially distinct triple-negative breast cancer.', 'The emerging roles of PHOSPHO1 and its regulated phospholipid homeostasis in metabolic disorders.', 'Exosomal Metabolic Signatures Are Associated with Differential Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Patients with Breast Cancer.']"""

Also, alcohol is a physiological ER stress inducer, and the link between alcoholism and progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is well documented but not well characterized. According to the canonical model, the mediator of ER stress, ATF6, is cleaved sequentially in the Golgi by S1P and S2P proteases; thereafter, the genes responsible for unfolded protein response (UPR) undergo transactivation.  Methods:   Cell lines used were non-malignant prostate epithelial RWPE-1 cells, androgen-responsive LNCaP, and 22RV1 cells, as well as androgen-refractory PC-3 cells. We also utilized PCa tissue sections from patients with different Gleason scores and alcohol consumption backgrounds. Several sophisticated approaches were employed, including Structured illumination superresolution microscopy, Proximity ligation assay, Atomic force microscopy, and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  Results:   Herein, we identified the trans-Golgi matrix dimeric protein GCC185 as a Golgi retention partner for both S1P and S2P, and in cells lacking GCC185, these enzymes lose intra-Golgi situation. Progression of prostate cancer (PCa) is associated with overproduction of S1P and S2P but monomerization of GCC185 and its downregulation. Utilizing different ER stress models, including ethanol administration, we found that PCa cells employ an elegant mechanism that auto-activates ER stress by fragmentation of Golgi, translocation of S1P and S2P from Golgi to ER, followed by intra-ER cleavage of ATF6, accelerated UPR, and cell proliferation. The segregation of S1P and S2P from Golgi and activation of ATF6 are positively correlated with androgen receptor signaling, different disease stages, and alcohol consumption. Finally, depletion of ATF6 significantly retarded the growth of xenograft prostate tumors and blocks production of pro-metastatic metabolites.  Conclusions:   We found that progression of PCa associates with translocation of S1P and S2P proteases to the ER and subsequent ATF6 cleavage. This obviates the need for ATF6 transport to the Golgi and enhances UPR and cell proliferation. Thus, we provide the novel mechanistic model of ATF6 activation and ER stress implication in the progression of PCa, suggesting ATF6 is a novel promising target for prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Artem N Pachikov', 'Ryan R Gough', 'Caroline E Christy', 'Mary E Morris', 'Carol A Casey', 'Chad A LaGrange', 'Ganapati Bhat', 'Anatoly V Kubyshkin', 'Iryna I Fomochkina', 'Evgeniya Y Zyablitskaya', 'Tatiana P Makalish', 'Elena P Golubinskaya', 'Kateryna A Davydenko', 'Sergey N Eremenko', 'Jean-Jack M Riethoven', 'Amith S Maroli', 'Thomas S Payne', 'Robert Powers', 'Alexander Y Lushnikov', 'Amanda J Macke', 'Armen Petrosyan']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Dependence of site-2 protease cleavage of ATF6 on prior site-1 protease digestion is determined by the size of the luminal domain of ATF6.', 'Nelfinavir inhibits regulated intramembrane proteolysis of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and activating transcription factor 6 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of disulfide bridges formed in the luminal domain of ATF6 in sensing endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Transcription factors activated through RIP (regulated intramembrane proteolysis) and RAT (regulated alternative translocation).', 'Site-1 and site-2 proteases: A team of two in regulated proteolysis.', 'Activation of ACLY by SEC63 deploys metabolic reprogramming to facilitate hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis upon endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Role of ER Stress in Xenobiotic-Induced Liver Diseases and Hepatotoxicity.', 'The endoplasmic reticulum stress response in prostate cancer.', 'ROS and Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in Pulmonary Disease.', 'Alcohol and Prostate Cancer: Time to Draw Conclusions.']"""

Targeting these mechanisms therapeutically may be important in managing cancer progression. Here, we identify the ELF3 transcription factor as the canonical mediator of IL-1α-induced differentiation of prostate mesenchymal stem cells to an iCAF phenotype, typical of the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, IL-1α-induced iCAFs were subsequently refractive to TGF-β1 induced trans-differentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype (myCAF), another key carcinoma-associated fibroblast subtype typical of reactive stroma in cancer. Restricted trans-differentiation was associated with phosphorylation of the YAP protein, indicating that interplay between ELF3 action and activation of the Hippo pathway are critical for restricting trans-differentiation of iCAFs.

Transcriptome-wide association study combined with validation comparing overall levels will help to identify candidate genes potentially playing a role in prostate cancer development. Using data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project, we built genetic models to predict normal prostate tissue gene expression using the statistical framework PrediXcan, a modified version of the unified test for molecular signatures and Joint-Tissue Imputation. We applied these prediction models to the genetic data of 79 194 prostate cancer cases and 61 112 controls to investigate the associations of genetically determined gene expression with prostate cancer risk. Focusing on associated genes, we compared their expression in prostate tumor vs normal prostate tissue, compared methylation of CpG sites located at these loci in prostate tumor vs normal tissue, and assessed the correlations between the differentiated genes' expression and the methylation of corresponding CpG sites, by analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We identified 573 genes showing an association with prostate cancer risk at a false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.05, including 451 novel genes and 122 previously reported genes.

The 1245A→C missense-encoding polymorphism in HSD3B1, which is common in White populations, is functionally adrenal permissive and increases synthesis of the aromatase substrate androstenedione. We hypothesized that homozygous inheritance of the adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) is associated with postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer.METHODSA prospective study of postmenopausal ER-driven breast cancer was done for determination of HSD3B1 and circulating steroids. Validation was performed in 2 other cohorts. Adrenal-permissive genotype frequency was compared between postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer, the general population, and postmenopausal ER-negative breast cancer.RESULTSProspective and validation studies had 157 and 538 patients, respectively, for the primary analysis of genotype frequency by ER status in White female breast cancer patients who were postmenopausal at diagnosis. The adrenal-permissive genotype frequency in postmenopausal White women with estrogen-driven breast cancer in the prospective cohort was 17.5% (21/120) compared with 5.4% (2/37) for ER-negative breast cancer (P = 0.108) and 9.6% (429/4451) in the general population (P = 0.0077). Adrenal-permissive genotype frequency for estrogen-driven postmenopausal breast cancer was validated using Cambridge and The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets: 14.4% (56/389) compared with 6.0% (9/149) for ER-negative breast cancer (P = 0.007) and the general population (P = 0.005). Circulating androstenedione concentration was higher with the adrenal-permissive genotype (P = 0.03).CONCLUSIONAdrenal-permissive genotype is associated with estrogen-driven postmenopausal breast cancer.

Herein, we hypothesized that differences in androgen biosynthetic and metabolic pathways, rather than differences in specific androgen concentrations, are associated with prostatic carcinogenesis. Therefore, spot urine samples from 111 incident PC cases with Gleason score at diagnosis and 227 healthy population controls, were analyzed. Urinary androgen concentrations (nanograms/milligrams of creatinine) were determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). Using a factor analysis, we identified three androgen urinary excretion patterns. In a subsample, we evaluated a modification effect of the androgen receptor (AR) CAG polymorphism. Pattern I, characterized by A4 and testosterone hydroxylated metabolites (11β-OHT; 2β-OHT; 15β-OHT; 2α-OHT; 6β-OHT), was associated with high PC odds among carriers of AR gene (CAG)>19 repeats (OR: 3.67 95% CI: 1.23-11.0; P for interaction= 0.009).

No clear association was observed with pattern II (DHEA; 16α and 16β-OHT). Our results were consistent with the previous evidence which suggests that the C11-oxy backdoor pathway is important for prostatic carcinogenesis.

However, it has not yet been possible to incorporate information of DNA methylation and gene expression into polygenic risk scores (PRSs). Here, we aimed to develop and validate an improved PRS for PCa risk by incorporating genetically predicted gene expression and DNA methylation, and other genomic information using an integrative method.  Methods:   Using data from the PRACTICAL consortium, we derived multiple sets of genetic scores, including those based on available single-nucleotide polymorphisms through widely used methods of pruning and thresholding, LDpred, LDpred-funt, AnnoPred, and EBPRS, as well as PRS constructed using the genetically predicted gene expression and DNA methylation through a revised pruning and thresholding strategy. In the tuning step, using the UK Biobank data (1458 prevalent cases and 1467 controls), we selected PRSs with the best performance. Using an independent set of data from the UK Biobank, we developed an integrative PRS combining information from individual scores. Furthermore, in the testing step, we tested the performance of the integrative PRS in another independent set of UK Biobank data of incident cases and controls.  Results:   Our constructed PRS had improved performance (C statistics: 76.1%) over PRSs constructed by individual benchmark methods (from 69.6% to 74.7%). Furthermore, our new PRS had much higher risk assessment power than family history. The overall net reclassification improvement was 69.0% by adding PRS to the baseline model compared with 12.5% by adding family history.  Conclusions:   We developed and validated a new PRS which may improve the utility in predicting the risk of developing PCa.

The second objective was to compare the [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT findings with standard of care pelvic multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in the detection of locoregional lymph node metastases and intraprostatic prostate cancer.  Procedures:   A total of 81 patients (mean age: 64.5 years, baseline mean trigger PSA (tPSA) 15.4 ng/ml, ± 15.9) with biopsy proven PCa (24 intermediate- and 57 high risk) scheduled for RPE and ePLND were enrolled in this prospective study. In 52 patients [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, pelvic mpMRI, and RPE with ePLND have been performed. Clinical risk stratification and related biomarkers as well as Gleason score (GS) were recorded. The location of the index lesion (IL) was documented systematically for each modality using a standardized segmentation of the prostate in six segments. Distant bone and lymph node metastasis detected by [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were documented. [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT findings were correlated with results of mpMRI and histopathology. A consensus of imaging, clinical and/or follow-up findings were used for determining the distant metastases, which were not verified by histopathology.  Results:   In the patient cohort who underwent RPE, [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and mpMRI detected the IL in 86.5% and 98.1% of the patients, respectively. The median of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the intraprostatic IL was 12 (range, 4.7-67.8). Intraprostatic IL of the high-risk patients showed significantly higher SUVmax than those in patients with intermediate risk for distant metastases (n = 48; median: 17.84 vs. 8.77; p = 0.02). In total 729 LN were removed by ePLND in 48 patients. The histopathology verified 26 pelvic lymph node metastases (pLNM) in 20.8% (10/48) of the patients, which have been correctly identified in 60% of the patients on [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and in 50% on mpMRI. All but one pLNM had a maximum diameter below 10 mm. Bone metastases (BM) and distant LNM (dLNM) were found in 17.3% of the patients on [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging. 39.0% of the [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET-positive BM showed no suspicious morphological correlation on CT.  Conclusion:   [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT shows high diagnostic performance for N and M staging of patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer and seems to be superior to pelvic mpMRI in the detection of locoregional lymph node metastases. A significant correlation was found between SUVmax of the intraprostatic index lesion and risk stratification based on tPSA level and GS.

These images have coarse through-plane resolution, are non-isotropic, and have long acquisition times (approximately 10-15 min). The model we developed aims to preserve high-frequency details that are normally lost after 3D reconstruction. We propose a novel framework for generating isotropic volumes using generative adversarial networks (GAN) from anisotropic 2D T2w-TSE and single-shot fast spin echo (ssFSE) images. The CycleGAN model used in this study allows the unpaired dataset mapping to reconstruct super-resolution (SR) volumes. Fivefold cross-validation was performed. The improvements from patch-to-volume reconstruction (PVR) to SR are 80.17%, 63.77%, and 186% for perceptual index (PI), RMSE, and SSIM, respectively; the improvements from slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) to SR are 72.41%, 17.44%, and 7.5% for PI, RMSE, and SSIM, respectively. Five ssFSE cases were used to test for generalizability; the perceptual quality of SR images surpasses the in-plane ssFSE images by 37.5%, with 3.26% improvement in SSIM and a higher RMSE by 7.92%. SR images were quantitatively assessed with radiologist Likert scores. Our isotropic SR volumes are able to reproduce high-frequency detail, maintaining comparable image quality to in-plane TSE images in all planes without sacrificing perceptual accuracy. The SR reconstruction networks were also successfully applied to the ssFSE images, demonstrating that high-quality isotropic volume achieved from ultra-fast acquisition is feasible.""","""['Yucheng Liu', 'Yulin Liu', 'Rami Vanguri', 'Daniel Litwiller', 'Michael Liu', 'Hao-Yun Hsu', 'Richard Ha', 'Hiram Shaish', 'Sachin Jambawalikar']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Digit Imaging""","""['A novel hybrid generative adversarial network for CT and MRI super-resolution reconstruction.', 'SOUP-GAN: Super-Resolution MRI Using Generative Adversarial Networks.', 'Super-Resolution Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Knee Using 2-Dimensional Turbo Spin Echo Imaging.', 'Generative adversarial network-based post-processed image super-resolution technology for accelerating brain MRI: comparison with compressed sensing.', 'Artificial Intelligence-Driven Ultra-Fast Superresolution MRI: 10-Fold Accelerated Musculoskeletal Turbo Spin Echo MRI Within Reach.']"""

GnRH analogs act locally in the prostate by triggering apoptosis of PCa cells via activation of the GnRH receptor (GnRHR). During PCa progression, the distribution of GnRHR within the cell is altered, with reduced expression in the cell membrane and remaining sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum. Pharmacoperone IN3 is able to relocalize GnRHR to the cell membrane. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of radiation on PCa cells pretreated with leuprolide, alone or in combination with IN3, as radiosensitizers.  Material and methods:   PC3 and human PCa primary cell cultures were treated with IN3 for 24 h, followed by different doses of leuprolide for 48 h and, finally, single doses of radiation (3, 6, and 9 Gy). After radiation, cell survival, apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and colony growth were evaluated.  Results:   Radiation reduced cell survival and increased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was also directly related to leuprolide concentration. Pretreatment with IN3 enhanced apoptosis and decreased cell survival, also observing a higher proportion of cells arrested in G2.  Conclusion:   Neoadjuvant leuprolide increases radiation-mediated apoptosis of PCa cells. This effect was enhanced by pretreatment with pharmacoperone IN3. Clinical use of IN3 as a radiosensitizer combined with androgen deprivation therapy to improve survival of patients with PCa remains to be evaluated.""","""['Catherine Sánchez', 'Alejandro Mercado', 'Héctor R Contreras', 'Felipe Carvajal V', 'Apolo Salgado', 'Christian Huidobro', 'Enrique A Castellón']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Pharmacoperone IN3 enhances the apoptotic effect of leuprolide in prostate cancer cells by increasing the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor in the cell membrane.', 'Effect of GnRH analogs on the expression of TrkA and p75 neurotrophin receptors in primary cell cultures from human prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Effect of leuprolide and cetrorelix on cell growth, apoptosis, and GnRH receptor expression in primary cell cultures from human prostate carcinoma.', 'Leuprolide acetate: a drug of diverse clinical applications.', 'Cancer stem cell and mesenchymal cell cooperative actions in metastasis progression and hormone resistance in prostate cancer: Potential role of androgen and gonadotropin‑releasing hormone receptors (Review).', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identifies a signature based on macrophage marker genes involved in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness.']"""

However, the role of HN1L in the progression of prostate cancer (PCA) remains unknown. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of HN1L in stemness and progression of PCA. The expression of HN1L in PCA tissues and cells was determined by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), western blot analysis, and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC). CD133+ cells were sorted from PCA cells using magnetic fluorescence cell sorting technology and were considered as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Sphere formation assays, transwell assays, and animal experiments were conducted to assess cell stemness, migration, invasion, and in vivo tumorigenesis, respectively. The results showed that HN1L expression was higher in PCA tissues and cells as compared with normal tissues and cells, as well as in CD133+ cells as compared with CD133- cells. HN1L knockdown significantly decreased the expression levels of CSC markers including OCT4 (POU class 5 homeobox 1), CD44, and SRY-box transcription factor 2, inhibited cell migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis and decreased the number of tumor spheroids and CD133+ cell population. Furthermore, we found that HN1L could bind to forkhead box P2 (FOXP2) and positively regulated transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expression via upregulation of FOXP2.

This study assesses the impact enzalutamide has on patient-reported fatigue (""fatigue"") by using patient-reported outcomes from four pivotal, placebo-controlled trials of enzalutamide (ARCHES (NCT02677896), PROSPER (NCT02003924), PREVAIL (NCT01212991), and AFFIRM (NCT00974311)).  Methods:   Fatigue was assessed in the individual studies using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate item GP1 at baseline, weeks 13 or 17, and every 12 weeks until disease progression. Longitudinal changes were assessed using mean scores and mixed-model repeated measures.  Results:   The fatigue rates at baseline were higher in patients with later-stage disease (metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)) and among patients who had already received prior treatment lines; rates ranged between 58% in PROSPER (nonmetastatic CRPC) and 86% in AFFIRM (post-docetaxel metastatic CRPC). Irrespective of disease state, initiation of enzalutamide or placebo resulted in an early increase of fatigue (by weeks 13 or 17), with fatigue levels stabilizing thereafter. At last assessment, ≥55% of patients reported fatigue improvement or stabilization in all trials compared to baseline. More patients reported fatigue worsening by ≥1 or ≥2 units with enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) than with placebo plus ADT in ARCHES, PROSPER, and PREVAIL, but the between-group difference was <10% in all trials.  Conclusions:   The levels of fatigue were greater in mCRPC and lower in earlier states of disease. In all trials, patients reported a small increase in fatigue for the first 13-17 weeks after starting enzalutamide or placebo, with slightly greater fatigue with enzalutamide in all studies except AFFIRM, but fatigue stabilized or improved thereafter.

In recent years, more and more studies have shown that long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) plays a key role in a variety of human diseases, including NP. However, the role of LncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 19 (PCAT19) in NP and its specific mechanism remain unclear.  Methods:   A chronic constrictive injury (CCI) rat model was established. Rat paw withdrawal threshold and paw withdrawal latency were used to evaluate the neuronal pain behavior of rats in this model. mRNA expression of PCAT19, neuroinflammatory factor, microRNA (miR)-182-5p, and Jumonji domain containing 1A (JMJD1A) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. ELISA analysis was used to detect inflammatory factor protein expression. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to evaluate the targeting relationship between genes.  Results:   PCAT19 was continuously upregulated in CCI rats. miR-182-5p was the target of PCAT19, and miR-182-5p was increased after PCAT19 knockdown. NP behaviors such as mechanical ectopic pain and thermal hyperalgesia as well as neuroinflammation can be reduced by knocking down PCAT19. However, the injection of miR-182-5p antagomir significantly reversed the level of the NP behaviors and neuroinflammation caused by PCAT19 knockdown. Besides, dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that JMJD1A was the target gene of miR-182-5p. The level of JMJD1A in CCI rats increased with time. After PCAT19 knockdown, JMJD1A was significantly decreased, but inhibition of miR-182-5p can reverse its levels.  Conclusion:   This study shows that PCAT19 plays a role in NP by targeting the miR-182-5p/JMJD1A axis, and PCAT19 can be used as a new therapeutic target for NP.""","""['Miao Huo', 'Xingxing Zheng', 'Ning Bai', 'Ruifen Xu', 'Guang Yang', 'Ziyu Zhao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Neuroimmunomodulation""","""['lncRNA MEG3 aggravated neuropathic pain and astrocyte overaction through mediating miR-130a-5p/CXCL12/CXCR4 axis.', 'MicroRNA-340-5p relieved chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain by targeting Rap1A in rat model.', 'LncRNA CRNDE exacerbates neuropathic pain in chronic constriction injury-induced(CCI) rats through regulating miR-146a-5p/WNT5A pathway.', 'LncRNA H19 modulates neuropathic pain through miR-141/GLI2 axis in chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats.', 'miR-185-5p alleviates CCI-induced neuropathic pain by repressing NLRP3 inflammasome through dual targeting MyD88 and CXCR4.', 'Construction of lncRNA-Mediated Competing Endogenous RNA Networks Correlated With T2 Asthma.']"""

Although MTAP deficiency has been reported in various tumours, MTAP is overexpressed and might promote oncogenesis in other cancers, including prostate and colon cancer. Currently, little is known about the MTAP status of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we immunohistochemically examined the expression of MTAP in surgically resected oral epithelial dysplasia (OED, n=7), carcinoma in situ (CIS) (n=16), and OSCC (n=118). In the normal epithelium, MTAP was only weakly expressed in the cytoplasm of the basal layer cells. In OED, CIS, and OSCC, MTAP was uniformly expressed in the cytoplasm of the dysplastic and cancer cells. In addition to cytoplasmic MTAP expression, 45 of 118 cases (38.1%) exhibited increased nuclear expression of MTAP in the cancer cells at the invasive front. Statistical analysis showed that the concomitant nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of MTAP was associated with a high budding score (p=0.0023); poor differentiation (p=0.0044); aggressive invasion patterns (p=0.0001); and features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), such as loss of E-cadherin expression (p=0.0003) and upregulated expression of vimentin (p=0.0002), slug (p=0.0002), and laminin 5 (p<0.0001). High expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 or 5, the functions of which are reported to be inhibited in MTAP-deficient cancer, was associated with the concomitant nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of MTAP (p<0.0001). Concomitant nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of MTAP was marginally significantly associated with worse 5-year relapse-free survival (p=0.045). These findings suggest that MTAP not only plays a role in the oncogenesis of OSCC, but that it might also make it more aggressive by inducing EMT through its activity in the methionine salvage pathway.""","""['Yusuke Amano', 'Daisuke Matsubara', 'Atsushi Kihara', 'Hiroshi Nishino', 'Yoshiyuki Mori', 'Toshiro Niki']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pathology""","""['Expression of protein arginine methyltransferase-5 in oral squamous cell carcinoma and its significance in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.', 'Immunoexpression of Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition Proteins E-Cadherin, β-Catenin, and N-Cadherin in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Subcellular localization and expression of E-cadherin and SNAIL are relevant since early stages of oral carcinogenesis.', 'Targeting tumors that lack methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP) activity: current strategies.', 'Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma: Challenges and opportunities.', 'Expression signature and molecular basis of CDH11 in OSCC detected by a combination of multiple methods.', 'Relationship between Tumor Budding and Partial Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition in Head and Neck Cancer.']"""

Prostate and tumor tissue samples were acquired from transgenic adenocarcinomas of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. Before euthanasia, mice were injected with [U-13C]glucose intraperitoneally (i.p.).

Urogenital and anorectal dysfunction is frequently reported after conventional LAR. Advanced minimally invasive techniques such as robotic (RoTME) and transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) might improve functional results by precisely dissecting and preserving autonomic nerves. We compared functional outcomes after RoTME or TaTME in a multicenter study.  Methods:   One hundred twenty patients (55 RoTME/65 TaTME) were prospectively included in four participating centers.

Methods:   In this retrospective multicenter cohort study patients with uni- or bilateral THR and 1.5 T or 3 T mpMRI were included. Seventy consecutive, standard-of-care examinations per field strength were evaluated regarding their diagnostic value. The overall diagnostic value and prostate imaging quality score (PI-QUAL) were assessed. Artifact severity in the localizer and mpMRI sequences (T2w, DWI, DCE) was scored on a 3-point scale. Correlation between diagnostic value and artifacts was analysed. Moreover, a subgroup analysis focussed on image quality at different 3 T scanner generations.  Results:   140 consecutive patients (mean age 72, median PSA value 8.3 ng/ml) were included.

There was a strong correlation between the diagnostic value, PI-QUAL score, and artifact severity in the localizer and DWI. T2w and DCE sequences showed overall low artifacts. Significant improvement in image quality for 3 T at the latest scanner generation was observed, especially for DWI (p < 0.03).  Conclusions:   MpMRI of patients with THR can be conducted at both field strengths without significant differences in artifacts.

Here, we identified the novel transcriptional factor ZNF507 as a key mediator in the progression of PC to an aggressive state.  Methods:   We analyzed ZNF507 expression in the data from various human PC database and high-grade PC patient samples. By establishment of ZNF507 knockdown and overexpression human PC cell lines, we assessed in vitro PC phenotype changes including cell proliferation, survival, migration and invasion. By performing microarray with ZNF507 knockdown PC cells, we profiled the gene clusters affected by ZNF507 knockdown. Moreover, ZNF507 regulated key signal was evaluated by dual-luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Finally, we performed xenograft and in vivo metastasis assay to confirm the effect of ZNF507 knockdown in PC cells.  Results:   We found that ZNF507 expression was increased, particularly in the highly graded PC. ZNF507 was also found to be associated with metastatic PC of a high grade. Loss- or gain-of-function-based analysis revealed that ZNF507 promotes the growth, survival, proliferation, and metastatic properties of PC (e.g., epithelial-mesenchymal transition) by upregulating TGF-β signaling. Profiling of gene clusters affected by ZNF507 knockdown revealed that ZNF507 positively regulated the transcription of TGFBR1, MAP3K8, and FURIN, which in turn promoted the progression of PC to highly metastatic and aggressive state.

Although androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) and antiandrogens confer increased survival rates, most patients eventually develop castration resistant disease (CRPC). Previous studies have shown that these treatments have limited cytotoxicity, and instead, promote tumor cell growth arrest. We show here that PCa cells grown in either charcoal-stripped serum or exposed to the antiandrogen, bicalutamide, undergo a senescent growth arrest marked by morphological changes, upregulated senescence-associated-β-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal), cathepsin D accumulation, and expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The senescent growth arrest is, however, transient, as cells can resume proliferation upon restoration of normo-androgenic conditions. Intriguingly, enrichment for senescent cells confirmed that ADT-induced senescent cells recover their proliferative capacity, even under prolonged androgen deprivation, and form androgen-independent outgrowths. Transplantation of the enriched senescent population into castrated, syngeneic mice confirmed that senescent cells escape the growth arrest and form castration-resistant tumors in vivo. Outgrowth from senescence was associated with increased expression of constitutively active androgen receptor splice variants, a common mechanism of resistance to ADT. Finally, the selective elimination of senescent PCa cells following ADT in vitro by the senolytic navitoclax (ABT-263) interfered with the development of androgen-independent outgrowth. Taken together, these data support the premise that ADT-induced senescence is a transient cell state from which CRPC populations can emerge, identifying senescence as a potential driver of disease progression. Furthermore, it is feasible that senolytic therapy to eliminate senescent PCa cells could delay disease recurrence and/or progression to androgen independence.""","""['Valerie Carpenter', 'Tareq Saleh', 'So Min Lee', 'Graeme Murray', 'Jason Reed', 'Andrew Souers', 'Anthony C Faber', 'Hisashi Harada', 'David A Gewirtz']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biochem Pharmacol""","""['Senescence and castration resistance in prostate cancer: A review of experimental evidence and clinical implications.', 'Stimulation of cellular senescent processes, including secretory phenotypes and anti-oxidant responses, after androgen deprivation therapy in human prostate cancer.', 'Carbidopa enhances antitumoral activity of bicalutamide on the androgen receptor-axis in castration-resistant prostate tumors.', 'Antiandrogens Inhibit ABCB1 Efflux and ATPase Activity and Reverse Docetaxel Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Study type:   Retrospective and simulation based on published data.  Subjects:   Patient cohort (21 men with Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2 score ≥3) from a single-center study.  Field strength/sequence:   3 T/diffusion-weighted imaging with single-shot echo-planar imaging.  Assessment:   Both clinical data and simulations based on previously acquired data were used to quantify the influence of b-value choice in normal peripheral zone (PZ) and PZ tumor lesions. For clinical data, ADC was determined for different combinations of b-values. Contrast-to-noise ratio and quantitative diffusion measures were simulated for a wide range of b-values.  Statistical tests:   Tissue ADC and the lesion-to-normal tissue ADC ratios of different b-value combinations were compared with paired two-tailed Student's t-tests. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Findings about b-value dependence derived from clinical data and from simulations agreed with each other. Provided measurement was limited to two b-values, simulation-derived optimal b-value choices coincided with PI-RADSv2 recommendations. For two-point measurements, ADC decreased by 15% when the maximum b-value increased from 1000 to 1500 seconds/mm2 , but corresponding lesion-to-normal tissue ADC ratio showed no significant change (P = 0.86 for acquired data). Simulations with three or more measurement points produced ADCs that declined by only 8% over this range of maximum b-value. Corresponding ADC ratios declined between 2.6% (three points) and 3.8% (21 points). Simulations also revealed an ADC reduction of about 19% with the shorter echo and diffusion time evaluated.

In addition, several magnetic resonance imaging variables associated with pelvic muscles, the urethra and the prostate were measured. Urinary continence was defined as non-use or use of just one incontinence pad per day. Logistic regression analyses aimed to identify the predictors of urinary incontinence 3 and 12 months after surgery.  Results:   Overall, 121 patients were included in the analysis. The incidence rates of urinary incontinence 3 and 12 months after surgery were 42% (51/121 cases) and 16% (19/121 cases), respectively. Logistic multivariable analysis showed that low average total psoas density was the only significant independent predictor of urinary incontinence 3 months after surgery (P < 0.01), and low obturator internus muscle thickness (P = 0.01), short membranous urethral length (P = 0.01) and low average total psoas density (P < 0.01) were significant independent predictors of urinary incontinence 12 months after surgery. By contrast, psoas muscle index was not statistically associated with urinary incontinence after surgery.  Conclusions:   Myosteatosis (low average total psoas density) could be a novel predictor of urinary incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.""","""['Shimpei Yamashita', 'Hiroki Kawabata', 'Ryusuke Deguchi', 'Yuko Ueda', 'Masatoshi Higuchi', 'Satoshi Muraoka', 'Hiroyuki Koike', 'Kazuro Kikkawa', 'Yasuo Kohjimoto', 'Isao Hara']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Myosteatosis as a novel predictor of urinary incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Appropriate preoperative membranous urethral length predicts recovery of urinary continence after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy.', 'Minimal residual membranous urethral length and membranous urethral length predict poor recovery from incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and after open radical prostatectomy.', 'Association Between Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Urethral Parameters and Continence Recovery Following Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Retzius-Sparing Robot-Assisted Robotic Prostatectomy: Past, Present, and Future.', 'CUA 2023 Annual Meeting Abstracts - Poster Session 12: Functional Urology, EDI, Other (Part 2) Sunday, June 25, 2023 • 7:00-8:30.', 'The Efficacy of Urinary Continence in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Bladder-Prostatic Muscle Reconstruction and Bladder Neck Eversion Anastomosis.', 'Prognostic Impact of Lymphatic Invasion in Patients with High-Risk Prostate Cancer after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Extended Lymph Node Dissection: A Single-Institution Prospective Cohort Study.']"""

Higher body weight is associated with chronic inflammation, increased angiogenesis, and treatment-resistant tumor phenotypes. Dietary tomato reduces PCa risk, which may be due to tomato inhibition of angiogenesis and disruption of androgen signaling. This pilot study investigated the interplay between tomato powder (TP), incorporated into control (CON) and obesogenic (OB) diets, and PCa tumor growth and blood perfusion over time in a transgenic model of PCa (TRAMP). Ultrasound microvessel imaging (UMI) results showed good agreement with gold-standard immunohistochemistry quantification of endothelial cell density, indicating that this technique can be applied to non-invasively monitor tumor blood perfusion in vivo. Greater body weight was positively associated with tumor growth. We also found that TP significantly inhibited prostate tumor angiogenesis but that this inhibition differentially affected measured outcomes depending on CON or OB diets. TP led to reduced tumor growth, intratumoral inflammation, and intratumoral androgen-regulated gene expression (srd5a1, srd5a2) when incorporated with the CON diet but greater tumor growth and intratumoral gene expression when incorporated with the OB diet.

Current guidelines recommend that all men make informed decisions about whether to be screened for PrCa. Little is known about the barriers and facilitators of informed decision-making (IDM) about PrCa screening in Black men.  Methods:   We conducted focus groups with a convenience sample of Black men aged 55 to 69 years from a primary care practice (n = 21). Template analysis was used to evaluate themes related to barriers and facilitators of IDM about PrCa screening.  Results:   IDM was impacted by external factors, intrinsic factors, and personal beliefs about PrCa screening. Family, friends, and clinicians played a paramount role in shaping attitudes about PrCa screening. Distrust of the medical community impaired IDM, and lack of clinician communication about PrCa screening further engendered mistrust. Participants felt they lacked adequate knowledge to make an informed decision about PrCa screening. Identified areas to promote IDM included education on racial disparities, education that screening is a personal choice, and differentiating PrCa screening from colon cancer screening.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that Black men may lack the prerequisite information to make informed decisions about PrCa screening, which is notable in light of known PrCa racial disparities.

Material/methods:   Thirteen patients with intermediate unfavorable (9) and selected high-risk (4) prostate cancer underwent dose-escalated SBRT in 4 or 5 fractions (BED1.5 = 279 Gy and 253 Gy, respectively). The VMAT treatment consisted in two 6FFF or 10FFF full arcs optimized to have the 95% isodose covering at least 95% of the PTV (2 mm isotropic expansion of the CTV). Whenever the real-time tracking registered a displacement that exceeded 2 mm during the setup and/or the beam delivery, the treatment was interrupted and the prostate motion was promptly corrected. The incidence of treatment-related genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, patient QoL and PSA outcomes were computed from the start of treatment to the last follow-up date.  Results:   All patients completed the treatment in the expected time (10.2 +/- 4.2 minutes) and their compliance to the procedure was excellent. No clinically significant acute Grade 2 or higher GI (rectal) and GU side effects were observed within 90 days from the treatment completion. The median IPSS increased from 8 at baseline to 12 one-month after treatment and settled to 6 at 3 months. EPIC-26 scores in the urinary domain decreased from a median baseline of 86 pre-treatment to 79 at one-month and returned to baseline at a later timepoint (median score of 85 at 3 months). EPIC-26 scores in the bowel domains did not show significant changes within 3 months following RT. The prostate was found within 1 mm from its initial position in 78% of the beam-on time, between 1 and 2 mm in 20%, and exceeded 2 mm only in 2%, after correction for motion which was performed in 45% of the fractions, either during setup or beam delivery.  Conclusions:   Our preliminary findings show that dose intensified SBRT for unfavorable prostate tumors does not come at the cost of an increased toxicity, provided that a reliable technique for real time prostate monitoring is ensured. Fast FFF beams contributed to reduce intra-fractional motion.

The burden of treatment cost can affect treatment adherence and, ultimately, mortality. Financial toxicity is a health equity issue, disproportionately affecting patients who are racial/ethnic minorities, have lower incomes, and are < 65 years old. Patient education about treatment cost and patient-oncologist cost discussions are recommended as ways to address financial toxicity; however, research shows cost discussions occur infrequently (Altice et al. J Natl Cancer Inst 109:djw205, 2017; Schnipper et al. J Clin Oncol 34:2925-34, 2016; Zafar et al. Oncologist 18:381-90, 2013; American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network 2010). Our overall goal is to address the burden of financial toxicity and work toward health equity through a tailorable education and communication intervention, the DISCO App. The aim of this longitudinal randomized controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of the DISCO App on the outcomes in a population of economically and racially/ethnically diverse cancer patients from all age groups.  Methods:   Patients diagnosed with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer at a NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center in Detroit, MI, will be randomized to one of three study arms: one usual care arm (arm 1) and two intervention arms (arms 2 and 3). All intervention patients (arms 2 and 3) will receive the DISCO App before the second interaction with their oncologist, and patients in arm 3 will receive an intervention booster. The DISCO App, presented on an iPad, includes an educational video about treatment costs, ways to manage them, and the importance of discussing them with oncologists. Patients enter socio-demographic information (e.g., employment, insurance status) and indicate their financial concerns. They then receive a tailored list of questions to consider asking their oncologist. All patients will have up to two interactions with their oncologist video recorded and complete measures at baseline, after the recorded interactions and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the second interaction. Outcome measures will assess discussions of cost, communication quality, knowledge of treatment costs, self-efficacy for treatment cost management, referrals for support, short- and longer-term financial toxicity, and treatment adherence.  Discussion:   If effective, this intervention will improve awareness of and discussions of treatment cost and alleviate the burden of financial toxicity. It may be especially helpful to groups disproportionately affected by financial toxicity, helping to achieve health equity.  Trial registration:   ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04766190.

We previously discovered hypervascularity in brain specimens from AD patients and consistent with this observation, we demonstrated that overexpression of Aβ drives cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis leading to hypervascularity and coincident tight-junction disruption and blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakiness in animal models of AD. We subsequently demonstrated that amyloid plaque burden and cerebrovascular pathogenesis subside when pro-angiogenic Aβ levels are reduced. Based on these data, we propose a paradigm of AD etiology where, as a compensatory response to impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF), Aβ triggers pathogenic cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis that underlies the conventional hallmarks of AD. Consequently, here we present evidence that repurposing anti-cancer drugs to modulate cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis, rather than directly targeting the amyloid cascade, may provide an effective treatment for AD and related vascular diseases of the brain.  Methods:   We explored whether the anti-cancer drug, Axitinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) can inhibit aberrant cerebrovascular neoangiogenic changes, reduce Aβ deposits and reverse cognitive decline in an animal model of AD. One month post-treatment with Axitinib, we employed a battery of tests to assess cognition and memory in aged Tg2576 AD mice and used molecular analysis to demonstrate reduction of amyloid plaques, BBB leakage, hypervascularity and associated disease pathology.  Findings:   Targeting the pro-angiogenic pathway in AD using the cancer drug, Axitinib, dramatically reduced cerebrovascular neoangiogenesis, restored BBB integrity, resolved tight-junction pathogenesis, diminishes Aβ depositions in plaques and effectively restores memory and cognitive performance in a preclinical mouse model of AD.  Interpretation:   Modulation of neoangiogenesis, in an analogous approach to those used to treat aberrant vascularization in cancer and also in the wet form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), provides an alternative therapeutic strategy for intervention in AD that warrants clinical investigation.

Both SPOP downregulation and mutation can lead to SPOP target stabilization promoting dysregulation of key regulatory pathways. CHD1 gene is commonly deleted in PCa. CHD1 loss significantly co-occurs with SPOP mutations, resulting in a PCa subclass with increased AR transcriptional activity and with a specific epigenetic pattern.  Methods:   In this study, SPOP alterations at mutational and protein levels and CHD1 copy number alterations have been analyzed and correlated with ERG and PTEN protein expression and with the clinical pathological features of the patients.  Results:   SPOP protein loss has been detected in 42.9% of the cases, and it has been strongly associated with PTEN protein loss (p < .001). CHD1 gene loss has been detected in 24.5% and SPOP mutations in 5.9% of the cases. Loss of CHD1 has been strongly associated with SPOP mutations (p = .003) and has shown a trend to be associated with ERG wt cancers (p = .08). The loss of SPOP protein (p = .01) and the combination of PTEN and SPOP protein loss (p = .002) were both statistically more common in grade group 5 cancers, with a prevalence of 60% and 37.5%, respectively. Furthermore, SPOP loss/PTEN loss and SPOP wt/PTEN loss phenotypes were strongly associated with extraprostatic perineural infiltration (p = .007). Strong CHD1 loss was associated with a shorter time to PSA recurrence in the univariate (p = .04), and showed a trend to be associated with the PSA recurrence risk in the multivariate analysis (p = .058).

We evaluated 17 primary prostate tumors from patients with pathogenic germline BRCA2 mutations (gBRCA2) and 21 primary prostate tumors from patients with pathogenic germline ATM (gATM) mutations, which were compared to 19 control tumors lacking HR gene mutations, as well as the TCGA prostate cancer cohort. HRD score was estimated by targeted sequencing (gBRCA2 and gATM) or by SNP microarray (TCGA). Tumor-associated T-cell densities were assessed using validated automated digital image analysis of CD8 and FOXP3 immunostaining (gBRCA2 or gATM) or by methylCIBERSORT (TCGA). CD8 + and FOXP3 + T-cell densities were significantly correlated with each other in gBRCA2 and gATM cases. There was no significant difference between CD8 + or FOXP3 + TIL densities in gBRCA2 or gATM cases compared to controls. In the TCGA cohort, HRD score was associated with predicted CD8 + and FOXP3 + TILs. Associations were also seen for HRD score and TIL density among the germline-mutated cases. In contrast to mismatch repair-deficient primary prostate tumors, cancers from germline BRCA2 or ATM mutation carriers do not appear to be associated with elevated TIL density.

We assessed time on treatment with ART and investigated predictors of time on treatment.  Material and methods:   Time on treatment with ART in men with mCRPC in the patient-overview prostate cancer (PPC), a subregister of the National Prostate Cancer Register (NPCR) of Sweden, was assessed by use of Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression. To assess the representativity of PPC for time on treatment, a comparison was made with all men in NPCR who had a filling for ART in the Prescribed Drug Registry.  Results:   2038 men in PPC received ART between 2015 and 2019. Median time on treatment in chemo-naïve men was 10.8 (95% confidence interval 9.1-13.1) months for abiraterone and 14.1 (13.5-15.5) for enzalutamide. After the use of docetaxel, time on treatment was 8.2 (6.5-12.4) months for abiraterone and 11.1 (9.8-12.6) for enzalutamide. Predictors of a long time on treatment with ART were long duration of ADT prior to ART, low serum levels of PSA at start of ART, absence of visceral metastasis, good performance status, and no prior use of docetaxel. PPC captured 2522/6337 (40%) of all men in NPCR who had filled a prescription for ART. Based on fillings in the Prescribed Drug Registry, men in PPC had a slightly longer median time on treatment with ART compared to all men in NPCR, 9.6 (9.1-10.3) vs. 8.6 (6.3-9.1) months.

Apart from its killing effects, IR can induce pro-survival factors leading to radioresistance of cancer. Mechanistic understanding of radiation resistance is warranted to overcome the pro-survival effects of IR.  Aim:   The aim of this study was to investigate the role of upstream stimulatory factor-1 (USF-1) in the induction of radioresistance in prostate cancer and its targeting by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to reverse resistance.  Methods and results:   This study reports here that USF-1 is a marker for radioresistance in PC-3 cells. Using protein-DNA array analysis, it was documented that DNA binding activity of USF-1 was elevated following IR in PC-3 cells. Novel HDAC inhibitors downregulated USF-1 binding either alone or in combination with IR. A 5 Gy dose of IR induced the expression of target genes of USF-1 (human telomerase reverse transcriptase [hTERT], IGF2R, CyclinB1, and Cdk1), however, HDAC inhibitors alone or in combination with IR reduced their expression as measured by real time RT PCR analysis. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that while USF-1 localized primarily in the nucleus following IR, it localized in the cytoplasm when treated with HDAC inhibitors/combination. Maximum effects of modulation of USF-1 expression (overexpression or suppression) were observed on hTERT activity as determined by dual-luciferase reporter assay. To further confirm the role of USF-1 in radioresistance, cell growth was analyzed using the real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system. This study found that USF-1-transfected cells proliferated faster than the vector-transfected cells with or without treatments with HDAC inhibitors/IR/combination. Colony forming assay also confirmed that USF-1 overexpression led to increased survival following IR. Importantly, colony-forming assay demonstrated that HDAC inhibitors reversed the radioresistance in both PC-3 and DU-145 cells.  Conclusion:   These studies demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors reverse the radioresistance in prostate cancer through down-modulation of USF-1-mediated transactivation of target genes involved in cell proliferation and cell cycle.""","""['Seema Gupta', 'Mansoor M Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['Upstream stimulatory factor (USF) as a transcriptional suppressor of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) in oral cancer cells.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors suppress telomerase reverse transcriptase mRNA expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Didox (a novel ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor) overcomes Bcl-2 mediated radiation resistance in prostate cancer cell line PC-3.', 'Modulation of cellular radiation responses by histone deacetylase inhibitors.', 'Proton pump inhibitors and sensitization of cancer cells to radiation therapy.', 'Emerging concepts in cancer therapy: Mechanisms of resistance.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed two population-based cohorts of individuals with TC or other neoplasms diagnosed between 1998 and 2012, in 28 Italian areas covered by population-based cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of SPC were stratified by sex, age, and time since first cancer.

The overall SIR was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.12-1.21) for SPC in TC patients, though no increase was shown for people with follicular (1.06) and medullary (0.95) TC. SPC with significantly increased SIRs was bone/soft tissue (2.0), breast (1.2), prostate (1.4), kidney (2.2), and hemolymphopoietic (1.4) cancers. The overall SIR for TC as a SPC was 1.49 (95% CI: 1.42-1.55), similar for all TC subtypes, and it was significantly increased for people diagnosed with head and neck (2.1), colon-rectum (1.4), lung (1.8), melanoma (2.0), bone/soft tissue (2.8), breast (1.3), corpus uteri (1.4), prostate (1.5), kidney (3.2), central nervous system (2.3), and hemolymphopoietic (1.8) cancers.

We evaluated the m6A regulation patterns of PCa based on 24 m6A regulators and correlated these modification patterns with TIME characteristics. Three distinct m6A regulation patterns were determined in PCa. The m6A regulators cluster with the best prognosis had significantly increased METTL14 and ZC3H13 expression and was characterized by low mutation rate, tumor heterogeneity, and neoantigens. The m6A regulators cluster with a poor prognosis had markedly high KIAA1429 and HNRNPA2B1 expression and was characterized by high intratumor heterogeneity and Th2 cell infiltration, while low Th17 cell infiltration and Macrophages M1/M2. The m6Ascore was constructed to quantify the m6A modification pattern of individual PCa patients based on m6A-associated genes. We found that the low-m6Ascore group with poor prognosis had a higher immunotherapeutic response rate than the high-m6Ascore group.

However, a comprehensive analysis of the predictive values of PARP1 alteration for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) effectiveness in tumors remains unclear, and the associations between its expression and immunotherapy signatures also needs to be explored further.  Methods:   We performed some analyses with the cBioPortal online database (https://www.cbioportal.org), TIMER2.0 (Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0, http://timer.comp-genomics.org/) and TCGA database (https://xenabrowser.net or https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/). Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier method, and the associations between PARP1 transcription levels and immune checkpoint gene expression, the number of neoantigens, tumor mutation burden (TMB) levels, and microsatellite instability (MSI) event are analyzed by spearman correlation analysis and visualization of those mentioned above is performed using R, version 3.6.3 (http://www.r-project.org/).  Results:   We found that PARP1 was altered in 1338 (2.9%) out of 45604 patients with diverse tumors, which was associated with markedly higher TMB levels in a variety of tumors (P < 0.01). Impressively, patients with PARP1 alterations in advanced tumors showed better overall survival (OS) in the ICI-treated cohort (P = 0.016). PARP1 altered group was substantially correlated with higher immune infiltrates across most tumors, including CD8+ T cells in colorectal adenocarcinoma (P = 0.0061), endometrial carcinoma (P = 0.0033), stomach cancer (P = 0.033), and cervical cancer (P = 0.026), respectively. The PARP1 altered group showed high expression in transcription (P < 0.001), and higher expression of LAG3, PDCD1, CTLA-4, and TIGIT (P < 0.05). Higher PARP1 expression was present in 27 tumor compared the corresponding normal tissues using the GTEx and TCGA databases and it had a worse OS in several tumors (P < 0.05). Further, high PARP1 expression was significantly associated with six immune cells (B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells) in most tumors, including colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) (P < 0.05). In particular, CD8+T cell infiltration, was also positively correlated with high PARP1 expression in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), brain lower grade glioma (LGG), LIHC, pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), thymoma (THYM), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), uveal melanoma (UVM) (P < 0.05, no data shown), and PARP1 expression was significantly positively correlated with the transcription levels of some of the 47 immune checkpoint genes, such as CD274, CTLA4, and PDCD1 in several tumors, including PAAD, LIHC, KIRC, HNSC, and BLCA (P < 0.05). A significant positive association between PARP1 expression and the number of immune neoantigen was found within COAD, KIRC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), PAAD and THYM (P < 0.05), and there were also significantly positive correlations between PARP1 expression and TMB in many tumors like adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), COAD, kidney chromophobe (KICH), LGG, LUAD, READ, skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (P < 0.05). In addition, high PARP1 expression was positively associated with microsatellite instability event in COAD, KIRP, BRCA, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), LGG, READ, UCEC, SKCM and LUAD (P < 0.05).

We found human PUM1 is highly expressed in a diverse group of cancer, including prostate cancer; enhanced PUM1 expression is also correlated with reduced survival among prostate cancer patients. Detailed expression analysis in twenty prostate cancer tissues showed enhanced expression of PUM1 at mRNA and protein levels. Knockdown of PUM1 reduced prostate cancer cell proliferation and colony formation, and subcutaneous injection of PUM1 knockdown cells led to reduced tumor size. Downregulation of PUM1 in prostate cancer cells consistently elevated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B) protein expression through increased translation but did not impact its mRNA level, while overexpression of PUM1 reduced CDKN1B protein level. Our finding established a critical role of PUM1 mediated translational control, particularly the PUM1-CDKN1B axis, in prostate cancer cell growth and tumorigenesis.

Mean absorbed organ doses for 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T were, for example, 1.65 ± 0.28 and 0.73 ± 0.18 Gy/GBq for the kidneys, 0.19 ± 0.09 and 0.07 ± 0.03 Gy/GBq for the liver, 2.35 ± 0.78 and 0.80 ± 0.41 Gy/GBq for the parotid gland, and 0.67 ± 0.62 and 0.30 ± 0.27 Gy/GBq for the bone marrow, respectively. Tumor lesions received mean absorbed doses of 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T of 6.44 ± 6.44 and 2.64 ± 2.24 Gy/GBq, respectively. The mean TIs for the kidneys were 3.7 ± 2.2 and 3.6 ± 2.2 for 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T, respectively, and those for the bone marrow were 15.2 ± 10.2 and 15.1 ± 10.2 for 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T, respectively. Conclusion: Pretherapeutic clinical dosimetry confirmed preclinical results of mean absorbed doses for tumors that were 2-3 times higher for 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 than for 177Lu-PSMA I&T. Absorbed doses to normal organs also tended to be higher for 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3, resulting overall in similar average TIs for both radiopharmaceuticals with considerable interpatient variability. 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 has promise for a therapeutic efficacy similar to that of 177Lu-PSMA I&T at smaller amounts of injected activity, simplifying radiation safety measurements (especially for large patient numbers or dose escalation regimens).""","""['Benedikt Feuerecker', 'Maythinee Chantadisai', 'Anne Allmann', 'Robert Tauber', 'Jakob Allmann', 'Lisa Steinhelfer', 'Isabel Rauscher', 'Alexander Wurzer', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Wolfgang A Weber', ""Calogero d'Alessandria"", 'Matthias Eiber']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Radiation Dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Absorbed Dose in Normal Organs and Tumor Lesions.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Radioligand Therapy Using 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Safety, Biodistribution, and Dosimetry.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Joint EANM/SNMMI procedure guideline for the use of 177Lu-labeled PSMA-targeted radioligand-therapy (177Lu-PSMA-RLT).', '177 Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 Induces Tumor Response in a Patient With mCRPC After PSMA-Directed Radioligand Therapy With 177 Lu-PSMA-I&T.', 'Biodistribution and dosimetry for combined 177LuLu-PSMA-I&T/225AcAc-PSMA-I&T therapy using multi-isotope quantitative SPECT imaging.', 'Introduction of a SiFA Moiety into the D-Glutamate Chain of DOTA-PP-F11N Results in Radiohybrid-Based CCK-2R-Targeted Compounds with Improved Pharmacokinetics In Vivo.', 'Albumin-Mediated Size Exclusion Chromatography: The Apparent Molecular Weight of PSMA Radioligands as Novel Parameter to Estimate Their Blood Clearance Kinetics.']"""

Decision aids have been applied primarily to patients with localized disease, with minimal inclusion of patients with advanced prostate cancer and their decision partners. The use of a community patient navigator (CPN) has been shown to have a positive supportive role in health care, particularly with individuals from minority populations. Research is needed to evaluate decision support interventions tailored to the needs of advanced prostate cancer patients and their decision partners in diverse populations.  Methods:   Guided by Janis and Mann's Conflict Model of Decision Making, the Cancer Health Aid to Manage Preferences and Improve Outcomes through Navigation (CHAMPION) is a randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a mobile health (mHealth), CPN-administered decision support intervention designed to facilitate communication between patients, their decision partners, and the healthcare team. Adult prostate cancer patients and their decision partners at three mid-Atlantic hospitals in the USA were randomized to receive enhanced usual care or the decision intervention. The CHAMPION intervention includes a theory-based decision-making process tutorial, immediate and health-related quality of life graphical summaries over time (using mHealth), values clarification via a balance sheet procedure with the CPN support during difficult decisions, and facilitated discussions with providers to enhance informed, shared decision-making.  Discussion:   The CHAMPION intervention is designed to leverage dynamic resources, such as CPN teams, mHealth technology, and theory-based information, to support decision-making for advanced prostate cancer patients and their decision partners. This intervention is intended to engage decision partners in addition to patients and represents a novel, sustainable, and scalable way to build on individual and community strengths. Patients from minority populations, in particular, may face unique challenges during clinical communication. CHAMPION emphasizes the inclusion of decision partners and CPNs as facilitators to help address these barriers to care. Thus, the CHAMPION intervention has the potential to positively impact patient and decision partner well-being by reducing decisional conflict and decision regret related to complex, treatment-based decisions, and to reduce cancer health disparities.

Current biomarkers are ineffective for the treatment and management of the disease. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a heterogeneous group of transcripts that are involved in complex gene expression regulatory networks. Although lncRNAs have been suggested to be promising as future biomarkers, the connection between the majority of lncRNAs and human disease remains to be elucidated. One approach to elucidate the roles of lncRNAs in disease is through the development of computational models. For example, a novel computational model termed HyperGeometric distribution for LncRNA-Disease Association (HGLDA) has been developed. Such models need to be developed on a tumor-specific basis to better suit the particular problem. Methods: In this study, we constructed a potential pipeline through two models, HGLDA and pathway-based using data from several databases. To validate the obtained data, the expression levels of selected lncRNAs were investigated quantitatively in the DU-145, LNCaP, and PC3 PC cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: We obtained a number of lncRNAs from both models, many of which were filtered through several databases that ultimately resulted in identification of six high-value lncRNA targets. Their expression was correlated with one important component of the PI3K pathway, known to be related to PC.

Thus, the present study aimed to identify determinants of structural barriers to PA in people with cancer and investigate the association between structural barriers and insufficient post-diagnosis PA, taking different PA change patterns into account.  Methods:   A total of 1299 people with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer completed a questionnaire assessing their socio-demographic and medical characteristics, pre- and post-diagnosis PA, and perceived PA impediment by seven structural barriers. Regression analyses were used to investigate determinants of the perception of structural barriers and to examine the association between structural barriers and insufficient post-diagnosis PA, also with regard to different pre-diagnosis PA levels.  Results:   Overall 30-60% of participants indicated to feel impeded by structural barriers. The analyses revealed a younger age, higher BMI, lower educational level, no current work activity, co-morbidities, and lacking physicians' exercise counseling as significant determinants of the perception of structural barriers. Individuals reporting stronger impediments by structural barriers were significantly less likely to be meeting PA guidelines post-diagnosis, particularly those with sufficient pre-diagnosis PA levels.

In Brazil, the public health system and the National Health Agency do not reimburse its utilization. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of IMRT and tridimensional radiotherapy (3D-RT) from a payer's perspective.  Methods:   We built a Markov model to delineate the health states after treatment with IMRT and 3D-RT. The treatment-related toxicity data were extracted from the literature. The sensitivity analyses were performed over potential parameters.  Results:   The incremental cost of IMRT was R$ 5,553.78. At a time horizon of 5 years, the quality-adjusted life expectancy after IMRT was higher than 3D-RT. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IMRT over 3D-RT was R$-296,74/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Therefore, IMRT was the dominant strategy, which depended on the value of interventional procedures for severe toxicity and the difference between IMRT and 3D-RT reimbursement. The IMRT was still most likely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay R$ 100,000/QALY, with a net monetary benefit (NMB) superior to 3D-RT after R$ 50,000.00, resulting in a difference of R$220.000,00 after 5 years.

A clear understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and their role during PCa tumorigenesis can help develop prognostic and targeted therapies. We analyzed datasets from public databases, including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis for differential expression of solute carrier family 16 member 5 (SLC16A5). We further investigated its relationship with clinical stage, pathological grade, and prognosis of PCa. The promoter methylation level of SLC16A5 in PCa was also investigated by UALCAN. We also utilized datasets from UCSC Xena to explore the prognostic role of SLC16A5 methylation levels and CpG site. Correlations between SLC16A5 and immune infiltration were discovered through TIMER. We observed significantly lower levels of SLC16A5 mRNA in PCa relative to normal tissues across six datasets from Oncomine database (p < .001) and 498 cases from TCGA database (p < .0001). SLC16A5 is strongly negatively regulated by its DNA methylation, with a Spearman of -0.81 and Pearson of -0.80 (p < .001). The aberrant SLC16A5 expression resulted in a significant relationship with clinical stage, pathological grade, and lower SLC16A5 mRNA expression, and its hypermethylation was related to a poorer PCa prognosis. SLC16A5 acted as an important factor for PCa diagnosis, with an AUC of 0.9038 (95% CI: 0.8597-0.9479; p < .0001). Besides, the aberrant SLC16A5 expression revealed close correlations with multiple immune cells.

In patients who presented <6 months to castration-resistant prostate cancer, progression-free survival was shorter in those treated with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (median 1.1 months, 95% confidence interval 0.2-2.8 months) compared with those who received docetaxel (median 5.0 months, 95% confidence interval 1.8-6.7 months; P = 0.014).  Conclusions:   First-line therapy with androgen receptor pathway inhibitor is associated with a better prognosis when compared with docetaxel, even after adjustment for prognostic factors. However, a shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with better progression-free survival for patients receiving docetaxel, suggesting that docetaxel is the preferred option for patients with a shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Masaki Shiota', 'Leandro Blas', 'Satoshi Kobayashi', 'Takashi Matsumoto', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Ario Takeuchi', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Ken-Ichiro Shiga', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Masatoshi Eto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Predictive factors of survival outcomes in first-line therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Cabazitaxel versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with prostate cancer using steroids.']"""

We evaluate preoperative MRI of robot-assisted simple prostatectomy (RASP) specimens and determine imaging features associated with histologic phenotype. Materials and Methods: All patients undergoing RASP from November 2015 to November 2019 with a multiparametric MRI ≤1 year before RASP were included. Patients without identifiable BPH nodules on histologic specimens were excluded. Histology slides were obtained from whole mount adenoma specimens and corresponding MRI were reviewed and graded independently by a blinded expert in BPH histopathology (D.W.S.) and an experienced radiologist specializing in prostate imaging (D.N.C.), respectively. Each nodule was assigned a phenotypic score on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = predominantly glandular; 5 = predominantly stromal) by each reviewer. Scores were compared using the sign test and univariate analysis. Signal intensity relative to background transition zone and nodule texture were noted on T2, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging sequences. Univariate and multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis were conducted to identify MRI features associated with histology score. All analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System (version 9.4). Results: A total of 99 prostate nodules in 29 patients were included. Median phenotypic scores by histology and MRI were comparable (2, interquartile range [IQR] 2-3 vs 2, IQR 2-4, respectively; p = 0.63). Histology scores were positively correlated with MRI scores (Pearson's correlation 0.84, p < 0.0001). Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis showed that low apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) signal intensity (p < 0.001) and DCE wash-in (p = 0.03) were positively associated with more stromal histology, whereas ADC standard deviation (p = 0.03), DCE wash-out (p = 0.001), and heterogeneous T2 texture (p = 0.003) were associated with more glandular histology. Conclusion: There is a strong correlation between MRI features and the histologic phenotype of BPH nodules. MRI may provide a noninvasive method to determine underlying BPH nodule histology.""","""['Jessica C Dai', 'Tara N Morgan', 'Ramy Goueli', 'Daniel Parrott', 'Alexander Kenigsberg', 'Ryan J Mauck', 'Claus G Roehrborn', 'Douglas W Strand', 'Daniel N Costa', 'Jeffrey C Gahan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Revisiting quantitative multi-parametric MRI of benign prostatic hyperplasia and its differentiation from transition zone cancer.', 'Transition zone prostate cancer: Logistic regression and machine-learning models of quantitative ADC, shape and texture features are highly accurate for diagnosis.', 'Amide Proton Transfer Could Provide More Accurate Lesion Characterization in the Transition Zone of the Prostate.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia after prostatic arterial embolization in a canine model: A 3T multiparametric MRI and whole-mount step-section pathology correlated longitudinal study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'PSA density is associated with BPH cellular composition.']"""

Design:   the cohort of nursery workers of the Pistoia province was assembled from two sources: subjects who obtained a pesticide license (PAT) and subjects who had been working in agricultural nursery, based on the 2003 regional census (LIF). Vital status and causes of deaths were ascertained through the official records of the municipalities and the Tuscany Mortality Register. The follow-up period for PAT cohort was from 01.01.1984 to 31.12.2015 and for LIF cohort was from 01.01.2003 al 31.12.2015.  Setting and participants:   the total cohort included 2,732 males and 326 females: the PAT cohort included 1,602 males and 106 females, and the LIF cohort included 1,130 males and 220 females MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: general and cause-specific Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for the entire cohort and for the PAT and LIF sub-cohorts. Expected deaths by age and gender for each cause of death were obtained from applying the respective rates in the Tuscan population.  Results:   overall mortality was lower than expected, with notable deficits for all cancers and some specific causes in both genders. Among males, increased SMRs were observed for pancreas (17 observed cases: SMR 129; CI95% 75-207), prostate (22 cases: SMR 121; CI95% 76-183), bladder (18 cases: SMR 139; CI95% 83-220) cancer, and also for multiple myeloma (5 cases: SMR 120; CI95% 39-281).

Results:   Four themes emerged: gaps in the information provided by secondary care doctors and nurses, communication skills needed in effective clinical information provision, a need for individualised information and alternative information sources used to meet unmet needs. Regardless of cancer stage and treatment, men with prostate cancer and their carers found information regarding common and burdensome adverse effects of prostate cancer treatment particularly lacking, and their ongoing and changing information needs often overlooked. They needed information delivered in a compassionate and individually tailored manner, considering content, timing and emotional support within the context of their unique life circumstances.

We characterized the origin of α2,3-sialylated prostate-specific antigen (S23PSA) by tissue-based sialylation-related gene expression and studied the performance of S23PSA density (S23PSAD) alone and in combination with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in men with elevated PSA.  Methods:   Tissue-based quantification of S23PSA and sialyltransferase and sialidase gene expression was evaluated in 71 radical prostatectomy specimens. The diagnostic performance of S23PSAD was studied in 1099 men retrospectively enrolled in a multicenter systematic biopsy (SBx) cohort. We correlated the S23PSAD with Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores in 98 men prospectively enrolled in a single-center MRI-targeted biopsy (MRI-TBx) cohort. The primary outcome was the PC-diagnostic performance of the S23PSAD, the secondary outcome was the avoidable biopsy rate of S23PSAD combined with DRE and total PSA (tPSA), and with or without PI-RADS.  Results:   S23PSA was significantly higher in Gleason pattern 4 and 5 compared with benign prostate tissue. In the retrospective cohort, the performance of S23PSAD for detecting PC was superior to tPSA or PSA density (PSAD) (AUC: 0.7758 vs. 0.6360 and 0.7509, respectively). In the prospective cohort, S23PSAD was superior to tPSA, PSAD, and PI-RADS (AUC: 0.7725 vs. 0.5901, 0.7439 and 0.7305, respectively), and S23PSAD + PI-RADS + DRE + tPSA was superior to DRE + tPSA+PI-RADS with avoidance rate of MRI-TBx (13% vs. 1%) at 30% risk threshold.

Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) transcribed from strong enhancers, or super-enhancers (SEs), have recently emerged as a novel class of regulatory non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that facilitate transcription, including that of androgen target genes, through chromatin looping to position enhancers proximate to the promoters. The aim of this study was to assess androgen-dependent transcription in prostate tumors of eRNAs (designated as KLK3eRNAs) from the SE of the KLK3 gene encoding the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) protein, a clinical marker of prostate carcinogenesis.  Materials and methods:   The androgen-induced KLK3eRNAs were identified in the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line. The expressions of these KLK3eRNAs together with KLK3 and AR mRNA transcripts were assessed by qRT-PCR in prostate tumor samples from five prostate cancer patients.  Results:   Androgen-induced KLK3eRNAs have been identified in the LNCaP cells, and their expression was further analyzed in tumors of prostate cancer patients. Transcripts of the tested KLK3eRNAs have been detected in all clinical samples, but their expression patterns differed between individual tumor specimens. We found a statistically significant correlation between the levels of the KLK3 and AR mRNAs with those of the previously reported KLK3eRNAs, while such correlation was not observed for novel KLK3eRNAs described in our recent report.  Conclusion:   Presented data suggest that prostate tumor development may associate with epigenetic reorganization in the KLK3 genomic regulatory elements reflected by changes of the KLK3eRNA expression. Our findings support a potential of eRNAs profiling to be used as diagnostic marker.""","""['Koichi Nishimura#', 'Jinichi Mori#', 'Takahiro Sawada', 'Shuhei Nomura', 'Alexander Kouzmenko', 'Kaori Yamashita', 'Yoshiaki Kanemoto', 'Tomohiro Kurokawa', 'Akira Hayakawa', 'Suguru Tokiwa', 'Michihisa Ochi', 'Hiroaki Shimmura', 'Shigeaki Kato']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Res Rep Urol""","""['Androgen-dependent and DNA-binding-independent association of androgen receptor with chromatic regions coding androgen-induced noncoding RNAs.', 'Enhancer RNAs participate in androgen receptor-driven looping that selectively enhances gene activation.', 'Long terminal repeats act as androgen-responsive enhancers for the PSA-kallikrein locus.', 'Enhancer RNAs: a missing regulatory layer in gene transcription.', 'Androgen-Driven Fusion Genes and Chimeric Transcripts in Prostate Cancer.', 'Emerging Role of Enhancer RNAs as Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers in Cancer.', 'A long non-coding RNA as a direct vitamin D target transcribed from the antisense strand of the human HSD17B2 locus.', 'Skeletal and gene-regulatory functions of nuclear sex steroid hormone receptors.', 'Roles of enhancer RNAs in sex hormone-dependent cancers.']"""

It is a slow progressing cancer, but when the disease reaches an advanced stage, treatment options are limited. Sequencing analyses of cancer samples have identified genes that can potentially drive disease progression. We implemented the CRISPR/Cas9 technology to simultaneously manipulate multiple genes in the murine prostate and thus to functionally test putative cancer driver genes in vivo. The activating protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor is associated with many different cancer types, with the proto-oncogenes JUN and FOS being the two most intensely studied subunits. We analyzed expression of FOS and JUNB in human prostate cancer datasets and observed decreased expression in advanced stages. By applying CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the role of these two transcription factors in prostate cancer progression was functionally tested. Our data revealed that loss of either JunB or Fos in the context of Pten loss drives prostate cancer progression to invasive disease. Furthermore, loss of Fos increases Jun expression, and CRISPR inactivation of Jun in this context decreases cell proliferation. Overall, these in vivo studies reveal that JunB and Fos exhibit a tumor suppressor function by repressing invasive disease, whereas Jun is oncogenic and increases cell proliferation. This demonstrates that AP-1 factors are implicated in prostate cancer progression at different stages and display a dual function as tumor suppressor and as an oncogene in cancer progression.""","""['Maria Riedel', 'Huiqiang Cai', 'Iben C Stoltze', 'Mikkel H Vendelbo', 'Erwin F Wagner', 'Latifa Bakiri', 'Martin K Thomsen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Oncotarget""","""['In vivo CRISPR inactivation of Fos promotes prostate cancer progression by altering the associated AP-1 subunit Jun.', 'Jun and Fos family protein expression in human breast cancer: correlation of protein expression and clinicopathological parameters.', 'The repertoire of fos and jun proteins expressed during the G1 phase of the cell cycle is determined by the duration of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.', 'Jun signalling in the epidermis: From developmental defects to psoriasis and skin tumors.', 'Oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation during multistage mouse skin carcinogenesis.', 'Integrating Pharmacogenomics Data-Driven Computational Drug Prediction with Single-Cell RNAseq to Demonstrate the Efficacy of a NAMPT Inhibitor against Aggressive, Taxane-Resistant, and Stem-like Cells in Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Application of CRISPR for In Vivo Mouse Cancer Studies.', 'In Vivo Application of CRISPR/Cas9 Revealed Implication of Foxa1 and Foxp1 in Prostate Cancer Proliferation and Epithelial Plasticity.', 'CRISPR/Cas9 application in cancer therapy: a pioneering genome editing tool.', 'Current strategies and progress for targeting the ""undruggable"" transcription factors.']"""

Dysregulation of Ca2+ signaling plays important roles during Pca progression. However, there is lack of information about the role of endolysosomal Ca2+ -permeable channels in Pca progression.  Methods:   The expression pattern of MCOLN2 was studied by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Cell viability assay, transwell assay and in vivo tumorigenesis were performed to evaluate the functional role of MCOLN2. Downstream targets of MCOLN2 were investigated by cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Ca2+ release experiments and luciferase reporter assays.  Results:   We report that MCOLN2 expression is significantly elevated in Pca tissues, and associated with poor prognosis. Overexpression of MCOLN2 promoted Pca cells proliferation, migration and invasion. Importantly, knockdown of MCOLN2 inhibited Pca xenograft tumor growth and bone lesion development in vivo. In addition, MCOLN2 promoted the production and release of IL-1β. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay and western blot revealed that MCOLN2 promoted Pca development by regulating the IL-1β/NF-κB pathway.  Conclusion:   In summary, MCOLN2 is crucially involved in Pca progression. Mechanistically, MCOLN2 regulates Pca progression via IL-1β/NF-κB pathway.

Because AR-V7 lacks ligand-binding domain, the AR-targeted therapies that aim to inactivate AR signaling through disrupting the interaction between AR and androgen are limited in CRPC. Thus, the emergence of AR-V7 has become the greatest challenge for treating CRPC. Targeting protein degradation is a recently proposed novel avenue for cancer treatment. Our previous studies have been shown that the oncoprotein AR-V7 is a substrate of the proteasome. Identifying novel drugs that can trigger the degradation of AR-V7 is therefore critical to cure CRPC. Here we show that nobiletin, a polymethoxylated flavonoid derived from the peel of Citrus fruits, exerts a potent anticancer activity via inducing G0/G1 phase arrest and enhancing the sensitivity of cells to enzalutamide in AR-V7 positive PC cells. Mechanically, we unravel that nobiletin selectively induces proteasomal degradation of AR-V7 (but not AR). This effect relies on its selective inhibition of the interactions between AR-V7 and two deubiquitinases USP14 and USP22. These findings not only enrich our understanding on the mechanism of AR-V7 degradation, but also provide an efficient and druggable target for overcoming CRPC through interfering the stability of AR-V7 mediated by the interaction between AR-V7 and deubiquitinase.""","""['Yuan Liu#', 'Cuifu Yu#', 'Zhenlong Shao', 'Xiaohong Xia', 'Tumei Hu', 'Weiyao Kong', 'Xiaoyue He', 'Wenshuang Sun', 'Yuanfei Deng', 'Yuning Liao', 'Hongbiao Huang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['LncRNA PCBP1-AS1-mediated AR/AR-V7 deubiquitination enhances prostate cancer enzalutamide resistance.', 'Targeting GRP78-dependent AR-V7 protein degradation overcomes castration-resistance in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Nuclear transport maintenance of USP22-AR by Importin-7 promotes breast cancer progression.', 'The crosstalk between ubiquitination and endocrine therapy.', 'Mechanisms and targeting of proteosome-dependent androgen receptor degradation in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibition in Advanced Castration Resistance Prostate Cancer: What Is Expected for the Near Future?', 'SNS-023 sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma to sorafenib by inducing degradation of cancer drivers SIX1 and RPS16.']"""

The aim of this study is to evaluate the functional results after open and laparoscopic approach.  Patients and methods:   From our global experience, over the period 2000/2018, within the patients surgically treated for rectal cancer, we have gathered and studied 37 patients with low-ultralow site of lesion, submitted to sphincterpreserving surgery, subdivided based on the approach: 20 open, 17 laparoscopic, of which 8 robotic . For each type of procedure, as low and ultralow anterior resection, intersphinteric resection, abdominoperineal resection, were investigated functional outcomes, as bowel continence, urinary functions, male and female sexual functions, based on the following tests: Wexner Incontinence Score, International Prostatic Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function- 5, Female Sexual Function Index. The controls were performed before surgery and 3-6-12 months postoperatively. Statistical analisis: X2-test, impaired and paired t-test two tailed, Bonferroni post-hoctest.  Results:   The immediate surgical results and pathological features of the tumor are reported and evaluated. The evaluation of fecal continence in all patients submitted to rectal resection and primary anastomosis showed function compromission without differences statistically significant between the laparo and open approach. In the comparison between specific surgical procedures, the damage of continence function were more severe after intersphinteric resection mached with low-ultralow rectal resection. The rehabilitation therapies continued for several months after surgery showed clear improvement. The urinary continence, in male and female patients, did not show statistically significant alterations in the pre and postoperative comparison in relation to the approach and the type of resective intervention. The sexual function in male patients has had impairment after all type of surgical resection but the damage was more severe after intersphinteric resection.

Reservoir placement in the SOR is a blind procedure despite the SOR being surrounded by many critical structures. To date only a handful of cadaveric studies have described the relevant anatomy.  Aim:   To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an in-vivo model to study relevant retropubic anatomy critical for SOR reservoir placement.  Methods:   The study population included men with elevated prostate specific antigen or biopsy proven prostate cancer who (i) underwent pelvic MRI, (ii) without prior pelvic or inguinal surgery, and (iii) without pelvic radiation therapy. All MRIs were completed with a 3-Tesla scanner and endorectal coil. Both T1 and T2 weighted images were captured in both axial and sagittal planes. All images were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers under the supervision of a dedicated body MRI radiologist. Bladder volume was calculated using an ellipsoid formula.  Outcomes:   Relevant measurements included (i) the distance between the external inguinal ring (EIR) at the level of the pubic tubercle to the external iliac vein (EIV), (ii) the distance from the EIR at the pubic tubercle to the bladder (accounting for bladder volume) and (iii) the distance from the midline pubic symphysis to the bladder (accounting for bladder volume). Pearson correlation was used to determine correlated measurements.  Results:   A total of 24 patients were included. Median participant age was 63 years (interquartile range, 59-66). The mean EIR-EIV distance was 3.0 ± 0.4 cm, the mean EIR-bladder distance was 1.8 ± 1.0 cm and the mean distance from the superior pubic symphysis to bladder was 0.9 ± 0.3 cm. There was a weak correlation between bladder volume and distance between the EIR and bladder (r = -0.30, P = .16).  Clinical implications:   The use of MRI as an in-vivo model is a high-fidelity tool to study real time unaltered anatomy and allows for surgical preparation, diagnosis of anatomic variants and acts as a valuable teaching tool.  Strengths & limitations:   This is the first in-vivo model to report relevant retropubic anatomy in penile implant surgery. Our study is limited by sample size and inclusion of participants with no history of prior pelvic intervention.  Conclusion:   We demonstrate the utility of MRI as an in-vivo model, as opposed to cadaveric models, for the understanding of relevant retropubic anatomy for implant surgeons.

Here, we examined the expression of DDR1 in prostate cancer (PCa), and assessed its potential value as a prognostic marker, as a function of grade, stage and other clinicopathologic parameters.  Methods:   We investigated the association between the expression level and subcellular localization of DDR1 protein and PCa aggressiveness by immunohistochemistry, using tissue microarrays (TMAs) encompassing 200 cases of PCa with various Gleason scores (GS) and pathologic stages with matched normal tissue, and a highly specific monoclonal antibody.  Results:   DDR1 was found to be localized in the membrane, cytoplasm, and nuclear compartments of both normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. Analyses of DDR1 expression in low GS (≤ 7[3 + 4]) vs high GS (≥ 7[4 + 3]) tissues showed no differences in nuclear or cytoplasmic DDR1in either cancerous or adjacent normal tissue cores. However, relative to normal-matched tissue, the percentage of cases with higher membranous DDR1 expression was significantly lower in high vs. low GS cancers. Although nuclear localization of DDR1 was consistently detected in our tissue samples and also in cultured human PCa and normal prostate-derived cell lines, its presence in that site could not be associated with disease aggressiveness. No associations between DDR1 expression and overall survival or biochemical recurrence were found in this cohort of patients.

We aimed to evaluate when, in case of unilateral HR disease, contralateral nerve sparing (NS) should be considered or not.  Materials and methods:   Within a multi-institutional data set we selected patients with unilateral HR prostate cancer, defined as unilateral EPE and/or seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) on multiparametric (mp) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or unilateral International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) 4-5 or prostate specific antigen ≥20 ng/ml. To evaluate when to perform NS based on the risk of contralateral EPE, we relied on chi-square automated interaction detection, a recursive machine-learning partitioning algorithm developed to identify risk groups, which was fit to predict the presence of EPE on final pathology, contralaterally to the prostate lobe with HR disease.  Results:   A total of 705 patients were identified. Contralateral EPE was documented in 87 patients (12%). Chi-square automated interaction detection identified 3 groups, consisting of 1) absence of SVI on mpMRI and index lesion diameter ≤15 mm, 2) index lesion diameter ≤15 mm and contralateral ISUP 2-3 or index lesion diameter >15 mm and negative contralateral biopsy or ISUP 1, and 3) SVI on mpMRI or index lesion diameter >15 mm and contralateral biopsy ISUP 2-3. We named those groups as low, intermediate and high-risk, respectively, for contralateral EPE. The rate of EPE and positive surgical margins across the groups were 4.8%, 14% and 26%, and 5.6%, 13% and 18%, respectively.

This hydride transfer complex (HTC) is assembled by malate dehydrogenase 1, malic enzyme 1, and cytosolic pyruvate carboxylase. HTC is found in phase-separated bodies in the cytosol of cancer or hypoxic cells and can be assembled in vitro with recombinant proteins. HTC is repressed in senescent cells but induced by p53 inactivation. HTC enzymes are highly expressed in mouse and human prostate cancer models, and their inactivation triggers senescence. Exogenous expression of HTC is sufficient to bypass senescence, rescue cells from complex I inhibitors, and cooperate with oncogenic RAS to transform primary cells.

How clinicians consider screening cessation across multiple cancer screening types is unknown.  Objective:   To compare and contrast clinicians' perspectives on discontinuing breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer screenings in older adults.  Design:   Qualitative, semi-structured interviews.  Participants:   Primary care clinicians in Maryland (N=30) APPROACH: We conducted semi-structured interviews with individual clinicians. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using standard techniques of qualitative content analysis to identify major themes.  Key results:   Participants were mostly physicians (24/30) and women (16/30). Four major themes highlighted differences in decision-making across cancer screenings: (1) Clinicians reported more often screening beyond guideline-recommended ages for breast and prostate cancers than colorectal cancer; (2) clinicians had different priorities when considering the benefits/harms of each screening; for example, some prioritized continuing colorectal cancer screening due to the test's high efficacy while others prioritized stopping colorectal cancer screening due to high procedural risk; some prioritized continuing prostate cancer screening due to poor outcomes from advanced prostate cancer while others prioritized stopping prostate cancer screening due to high false positive test rates and harms from downstream tests; (3) clinicians discussed harms of prostate and colorectal cancer screening more readily than for breast cancer screening; (4) clinicians perceived more involvement with gastroenterologists in colonoscopy decisions and less involvement from specialists for prostate and breast cancer screening.  Conclusions:   Our results highlight the need for more explicit guidance on how to weigh competing considerations in cancer screening (such as test accuracy versus ease of cancer treatment after detection).

Methods:   We analyzed two insurance claims databases: the Optum® de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart database for privately insured males aged 40-64 years (N ≈ 1,650,900 annually) and the Medicare 5% Sample for males aged ≥65 years (N ≈ 546,000 annually). We calculated the annual prevalence of LUTS/BPH and comorbid bladder cancer and bladder stones from 2004 to 2013. We additionally examined LUTS/BPH incidence and adherence to testing guidelines in a cohort of men newly diagnosed with LUTS/BPH in 2009.  Results:   While LUTS/BPH prevalence and incidence increased with increasing age, evaluation testing became less common. Urinalysis was the most common testing type but was performed in <60% of incident patients. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was the second most common test across age groups (range: 15-34%). Prevalence of comorbid bladder cancer (range: 0-4%), but not bladder stones (range: 1-2%), increased with increasing age.  Conclusions:   Although older men were at greater risk of LUTS/BPH than younger men, they were less likely to undergo testing at diagnosis.

We found lnc-OPHN1-5, which lies close to the androgen receptor (AR) gene on chromosome X, increased prostate cancer (PCa) Enzalutamide (Enz) sensitivity via decreasing AR protein expression and associated activity. Mechanism dissection revealed that lnc-OPHN1-5 interacted with AR-mRNA to minimize its interaction with the RNA binding protein (RBP) hnRNPA1. Suppressing lnc-OPHN1-5 expression promoted the interaction between AR-mRNA and hnRNPA1, followed by an increase of ribosome association with AR-mRNA and translation. This effect was reversed by increasing lnc-OPHN1-5 expression. Consistently, the in vivo mice model confirmed that knocking down lnc-OPHN1-5 expression in tumors significantly increased the tumor formation rate and AR protein expression compared with the control group. Furthermore, knocking down hnRNPA1 blocked/reversed shlnc-OPHN1-5-increased AR protein expression and re-sensitized cells to Enz treatment efficacy. Evidence from Enz-resistant cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, clinical samples, and a human PCa study accordantly suggested that patients with low expression of lnc-OPHN1-5 likely have unfavorable prognoses and probably are less sensitive to Enz treatment. In summary, targeting this newly identified lnc-OPHN1-5/AR/hnRNPA1 complex may help develop novel therapies to increase Enz treatment sensitivity for suppressing the PCa at an advanced stage.""","""['Meng Zhang#', 'Yin Sun#', 'Chi-Ping Huang#', 'Jie Luo', 'Li Zhang', 'Jialin Meng', 'Chaozhao Liang', 'Chawnshang Chang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'LncRNA PCBP1-AS1-mediated AR/AR-V7 deubiquitination enhances prostate cancer enzalutamide resistance.', 'Loss of Long Noncoding RNA NXTAR in Prostate Cancer Augments Androgen Receptor Expression and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'LncRNA HOXA-AS2 Promotes Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma by Regulated miR-302a-3p/IGF1 Axis.', 'The Role of Long Non-Coding RNAs in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition-Related Signaling Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A/B: an emerging group of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets.', 'Characterization of DNA methylation as well as mico-RNA expression and screening of epigenetic markers in adipogenesis.', 'Interaction between Non-Coding RNAs and Androgen Receptor with an Especial Focus on Prostate Cancer.']"""

Classically, prior history of urologic pelvic operations, such as prostatectomy, has been listed as relative contraindication for minimally invasive inguinal hernia repair. As the adoption of the robotics platform continues to grow, we aim to outline a feasible robotic-assisted inguinal hernia repair technique in patients with previous prostatectomies. We report the outcomes of 15 patients who underwent repair at 2 institutions.  Methods:   This is a retrospective case series of 15 patients who underwent robotic transabdominal preperitoneal approach repair of their inguinal hernias after prostatectomy. Demographics, intraoperative variables, and outcomes of our cases are described.  Results:   Fifteen patients were included in our cohort. All patients had a history of prostatectomy (7 open, 2 laparoscopic, and 6 robotic) due to prostate cancer. Median age was 70 years old (range: 60 to 89 y), with a median body mass index of 26.3 kg/m2 (range: 20.5 to 37.4 kg/m2). Hernia defects were bilateral in 6 patients and unilateral in the remaining 9 (right; 6, left; 3). The shortest interval between prostatectomy and subsequent hernia repair was 4 months (range: 4 to 216 mo). The median operative time was 139 min (range: 91 to 281 min). All defects were repaired using a polypropylene mesh except in 1 case, where a coated monofilament polyester mesh was used after having a large peritoneal defect to close, preventing future adhesions to the bowel. Mesh sizes used were large (16×11 cm), extra-large (17×12 cm) for anatomic mesh, and 20×15 cm for the monofilament polyester mesh. The mesh was fixed in 14 of 15 cases. Fixation was accomplished with absorbable suture (n=13), barbed suture (n=1), and fibrin sealant (n=1). Peritoneal closure was always performed using a continuous running v-loc suture. There were no documented major intraoperative complications, no 30-day readmission, or recurrences recorded within the follow-up period. Postoperatively, only 2 seromas and 1 hematoma were documented during the follow-up period.  Conclusions:   Robotic inguinal hernia repairs in patients with previous prostatectomy is safe and feasible in most patients. Larger patient series are needed to confirm these findings.""","""['Ruben D Salas-Parra', 'Diego L Lima', 'Xavier Pereira', 'Leandro T Cavazzola', 'Prashanth Sreeramoju', 'Flavio Malcher']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Surg Laparosc Endosc Percutan Tech""","""['Robotic-assisted laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair after previous transabdominal prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic transperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty (TAPP) after radical open retropubic prostatectomy: special features and clinical outcomes.', 'Combined inguinal hernia repair with prosthetic mesh during transperitoneal robot assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: a 4-year experience.', 'Feasibility of robotic-assisted minimally invasive inguinal hernia repair in patients with urologic considerations including artificial urinary sphincters and bladder herniation.', 'No prostate?

Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) improved detection of clinically significant disease and some studies suggest that MRI-fusion biopsy combined with systematic biopsy results in fewer upgrades on final surgical pathology. However, the downgrade rate is unclear and there is controversy in the literature. The objectives of this study are to assess the concordance of combination biopsy with final surgical pathology, and furthermore, to specifically determine downgrade rates.  Materials and methods:   In our institutional mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy database, 173 underwent targeted and systematic biopsy followed by radical prostatectomy (RP). GG on targeted, systematic and combination (targeted and systematic) biopsy were compared with GG on RP. Concordance rates between biopsy types were compared with the McNemar test. Proportion of GG upgrade or downgrade at the time of RP was also evaluated.  Results:   Surgical pathology was concordant with 44.5% of systematic biopsies, 46.8% of targeted biopsies, and 56.7% of combination biopsies. Combination biopsy significantly overestimated the final GG on RP compared to systematic biopsy (16.8% vs. 8.7% RR 1.93, 95% CI 1.36-2.75, P < 0.001). Downgrade rate from unfavorable to favorable intermediate-risk disease was 46.2%, and from high-risk to intermediate-risk disease was 45.1%.  Conclusions:   Combination (targeted and systematic) biopsy is associated with the highest concordance rate between biopsy and RP pathology when compared with systematic or targeted biopsy alone. However, targeting MRI lesions and therefore the higher risk components, may at times overestimate the final surgical pathology which can result in overtreatment of what may truly be less aggressive disease.""","""['Alice Yu', 'Tammer Yamany', 'Amirkasra Mojtahed', 'Nawar Hanna', 'Edouard Nicaise', 'Mukesh Harisinghani', 'Chin-Lee Wu', 'Douglas M Dahl', 'Matthew Wszolek', 'Michael L Blute', 'Adam S Feldman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Gleason Grade Group Concordance between Preoperative Targeted Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy Histopathologic Analysis: A Comparison Between In-Bore MRI-guided and MRI-Transrectal US Fusion Prostate Biopsies.', 'Direct comparison of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results with final histopathology in patients with proven prostate cancer in MRI/ultrasonography-fusion biopsy.', 'Targeted Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Quantitative Gleason 4 Grading Prediction in Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: Implications for Active Surveillance Candidate Selection.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Developing a predictive model for clinically significant prostate cancer by combining age, PSA density, and mpMRI.']"""

Methods:   The mpMR images of 120 patients were used to create hierarchical clustering and draw a dendrogram. Three clusters were selected for performing agglomerative clustering. Then, the DIL acquired from the mpMR images of 20 patients were categorized into three groups to have them treated with a DP procedure being composed of three planning target volumes (PTVs) determined as PTV1, PTV2, and PTV3 in treatment plans. The DP procedure was carried out on the patients wherein a total dose of 80, 85 and 91 Gy were delivered to the PTV1, PTV2, and PTV3, respectively. Dosimetric and radiobiologic parameters [Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP)] of the DP procedure were compared with those of the conventional IMRT and Three-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3DCRT) procedures carried out on another group of 20 patients. A post-treatment follow-up was also made four months after the radiotherapy procedures.  Results:   All the dosimetric variables and the NTCPs of the organs at risks (OARs) revealed no significant difference between the DP and IMRT procedures. Regarding the TCP of three investigated PTVs, significant differences were observed between the DP versus IMRT and also DP versus 3DCRT procedures. At post-treatment follow-up, the DIL volumes and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the DP group differed significantly (p-value < 0.001) from those of the IMRT. However, the whole prostate ADC and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) indicated no significant difference (p-value > 0.05) between the DP versus IMRT.  Conclusions:   The results of this comprehensive clinical trial illustrated the feasibility of our DP procedure for treating prostate cancer based on mpMR images validated with acquired patients' dosimetric and radiobiologic assessment and their follow-ups. This study confirms significant potential of the proposed DP procedure as a promising treatment planning to achieve effective dose escalation and treatment for prostate cancer.

This study identified factors uniquely associated with 5 different cancer-related identities in order to improve the understanding of how self-perception in men affected by prostate cancer is associated with certain clinical and psychosocial characteristics.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study, long-term prostate cancer survivors after radical prostatectomy were asked to choose one of 5 cancer-related identities that described them best. Associations with sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological variables were investigated using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   Three thousand three hundred forty-seven men (mean age 78.1 years) surveyed on average 15.6 years after prostatectomy were included. Most men favored the terms ""someone who has had cancer"" (43.9%) which was associated with a mild disease course, and ""patient"" (26.3%) which was associated with ongoing therapy and biochemical disease recurrence. The self-descriptions ""cancer survivor"" (16.8%), ""cancer conqueror"" (10.9%) and ""victim"" (2.1%) were less common. ""Cancer survivor"" was associated with high perceived disease severity (OR: 1.86 [1.44-2.40]).

Materials and methods:   In 2016, electronic patient-reported symptom monitoring began at our institution's ambulatory surgery center. We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with minimally invasive RP who were sent a daily questionnaire completed using a web interface until postoperative day 10. Severe symptoms automatically generate a ""yellow alert,"" which messages the clinic, while very severe symptoms generate a ""red alert,"" additionally prompting the patient to call.

Results:   Of 2,266 men undergoing RP, 1,942 (86%) completed surveys. Among moderate-to-very severe symptom levels, pain (72%) and dyspnea (11%) were most common. Pain, nausea and dyspnea consistently decreased over time; fever and vomiting had a flat pattern.

To present an efficient uncertainty quantification method for range and set-up errors in Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations. Further, we show that uncertainty induced by interplay and other dynamic influences may be approximated using suitable error correlation models.Approach. We introduce an importance (re-)weighting method in MC history scoring to concurrently construct estimates for error scenarios, the expected dose and its variance from a single set of MC simulated particle histories. The approach relies on a multivariate Gaussian input and uncertainty model, which assigns probabilities to the initial phase space sample, enabling the use of different correlation models. Through modification of the phase space parameterization, accuracy can be traded between that of the uncertainty or the nominal dose estimate.Main results. The method was implemented using the MC code TOPAS and validated for proton intensity-modulated particle therapy (IMPT) with reference scenario estimates. We achieve accurate results for set-up uncertainties (γ2 mm/2%≥ 99.01% (E[d]),γ2 mm/2%≥ 98.04% (σ(d))) and expectedly lower but still sufficient agreement for range uncertainties, which are approximated with uncertainty over the energy distribution. Here pass rates of 99.39% (E[d])/ 93.70% (σ(d)) (range errors) and 99.86% (E[d])/ 96.64% (σ(d)) (range and set-up errors) can be achieved. Initial evaluations on a water phantom, a prostate and a liver case from the public CORT dataset show that the CPU time decreases by more than an order of magnitude.Significance. The high precision and conformity of IMPT comes at the cost of susceptibility to treatment uncertainties in particle range and patient set-up. Yet, dose uncertainty quantification and mitigation, which is usually based on sampled error scenarios, becomes challenging when computing the dose with computationally expensive but accurate MC simulations.

Material and methods:   A total of 88 patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate and high-risk parameters were enrolled from 2011 to 2013. All patients received 78 Gy in 39 fractions of IMRT delivering simultaneous 78 Gy to the prostate and 56 Gy to the seminal vesicles and lymph nodes. Physician-reported morbidity was assessed by CTCAE v.4.0. PROs were registered for gastro-intestinal (GI) by the RT-ARD score, genito-urinary (GU) by DAN-PSS, sexual and hormonal by EPIC-26, and quality of life (QoL) by EORTC QLQ-C30.  Results:   Median follow-up (FU) time was 4.6 years. No persistent late CTCAE grade 3+ morbidity was observed. Prevalence of CTCAE grade 2+ GI morbidities varied from 0 to 6% at baseline throughout FU time, except for diarrhea, which was reported in 19% of the patients post-RT. PROs revealed increased GI morbidity (≥1 monthly episode) for ""rectal urgency"", ""use of pads"", ""incomplete evacuation"", ""mucus in stool"" and ""bowel function impact on QoL"" all remained significantly different (p < .05) at 60 months compared to baseline. CTCAE grade 2+ GU and sexual morbidity were unchanged. GU PROs on obstructive and irritative GU items (≥daily episode) increased during RT and normalized at 24 months. No clinically significant differences were found in sexual, hormonal, and QoL scores compared to baseline.  Conclusions:   Whole pelvic RT resulted in a mild to the moderate burden of late GI morbidities demonstrated by a relatively high prevalence of PROs. Whereas, physician-assessed morbidity revealed a low prevalence of late GI morbidity scores. This emphasizes the importance of using both PROs and physician-reported scoring scales when reporting late morbidity in clinical trials.""","""['Stine E Petersen', 'Lise B Thorsen', 'Steinbjørn Hansen', 'Peter M Petersen', 'Henriette Lindberg', 'Mette Moe', 'Jørgen B Petersen', 'Ludvig P Muren', 'Morten Høyer', 'Lise Bentzen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Late toxicity and quality of life with prostate only or whole pelvic radiation therapy in high risk prostate cancer (POP-RT): A randomised trial.', 'Early and late side effects, dosimetric parameters and quality of life after proton beam therapy and IMRT for prostate cancer: a matched-pair analysis.', 'Preliminary toxicity analysis of 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy versus intensity modulated radiation therapy on the high-dose arm of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0126 prostate cancer trial.', 'Late toxicity rates following definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Selecting a PRO-CTCAE-based subset for patient-reported symptom monitoring in prostate cancer patients: a modified Delphi procedure.', 'Proton therapy planning and image-guidance strategies within a randomized controlled trial for high-risk prostate cancer.', 'A Comparison between Patient- and Physician-Reported Late Radiation Toxicity in Long-Term Prostate Cancer Survivors.']"""

This study aimed to reveal the factors associated with the diagnosis of osteoporosis in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods:   This retrospective cross-sectional study included 106 prostate cancer patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy. Patients with bone metastasis at the initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and those with castration-resistant prostate cancer were excluded. Bone mineral density was measured at the lumbar spine and femoral neck using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Osteoporosis was defined as bone mineral density equal to or below either -2.5 SD or 70% of the mean in young adults. The association between clinicopathological variables and bone mineral density or diagnosis of osteoporosis was investigated.  Results:   Thirty-six (34%) patients were found to have osteoporosis. The incidence of osteoporosis increased in a stepwise manner depending on the duration of androgen deprivation therapy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a longer duration of androgen deprivation therapy (months, odd's ratio = 1.017, P = 0.006), lower body mass index (kg/m2, odd's ratio = 0.801, P = 0.005) and higher serum alkaline phosphatase value (U/l, odd's ratio 1.007, P = 0.014) as the factors independently associated with the diagnosis of osteoporosis. Eleven out of 50 (22%), 14 out of 35 (40%) and 11 out of 20 patients (55%) were osteoporotic in the patients with serum alkaline phosphatase values <238 U/l, 238-322 U/l and >322 U/l, respectively (P = 0.022).  Conclusions:   Osteoporosis is common in prostate cancer patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy; furthermore, its incidence increases depending on the duration of androgen deprivation therapy.

Aims:   We sought to identify factors associated with cancer screening in a publicly insured population with SMI and stratified by race, a factor itself linked with differential rates of cancer screening.  Materials and methods:   We used Maryland Medicaid administrative claims data (2010-2018) to examine screening rates for cervical cancer (N = 40,622), breast cancer (N = 9818), colorectal cancer (N = 19,306), and prostate cancer (N = 4887) among eligible Black and white enrollees with SMI. We examined individual-level socio-demographic and clinical factors, including co-occurring substance use disorder, medical comorbidities, psychiatric diagnosis, obstetric-gynecologic and primary care utilization, as well as county-level characteristics, including metropolitan status, mean household income, and primary care workforce capacity. Generalized estimating equations with a logit link were used to examine the characteristics associated with cancer screening.  Results:   Compared with white enrollees, Black enrollees were more likely to receive screening for cervical cancer (AOR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.15-1.22), breast cancer (AOR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.19-1.36), and colorectal cancer (AOR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.02-1.13), while similar rates were observed for prostate cancer screening (AOR: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.96-1.18).

Focal adhesion kinase (PTK2/FAK) is a key enzyme involved in evasion of anoikis. We show that loss of the Cub-domain containing protein-1 (CDCP1), paradoxically stimulates FAK activation in the detached state of prostate cancer cells. In CDCP1low DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells, detachment-activation of FAK occurs through local production of PI(4,5)P2. PI(4,5)P2 is generated by the PIP5K1c-201 splicing isoform of PIP5K1c, which contains a unique SRC phosphorylation site. In the detached state, reduced expression of CDCP1 and an alternative CDCP1-independent SRC activation mechanism triggers PIP5K1c-pY644 phosphorylation by SRC. This causes a switch of Talin binding from β1-integrin to PIP5K1c-pY644 and leads to activation of PIP5K1c-FAK. Reduced CDCP1 expression also inactivates CDK5, a negative regulator of PIP5K1c. Furthermore, immersion of prostate cancer cells in 10% human plasma or fetal bovine serum is required for activation of PIP5K1c-FAK. The PIP5K1c induced detachment-activation of FAK in preclinical models sensitizes CDCP1low prostate cancer cells to FAK inhibitors. In patients, CDCP1High versus CDCP1low circulating tumor cells differ in expression of AR-v7, ONECUT2 and HOXB13 oncogenes and TMPRSS2 and display intra-patient heterogeneity of FAK-pY397 expression. Taken together, CDCP1low and CDCP1high detached prostate cancer cells activate distinct cytoplasmic kinase complexes and targetable transcription factors, which has important therapeutic implications.""","""['Sara G Pollan', 'Pai-Chi Teng', 'Yu Jen Jan', 'Julie Livingstone', 'Cai Huang', 'Minhyung Kim', 'Javier Mariscal', 'Maria Rodriguez', 'Jie-Fu Chen', 'Sungyong You', 'Dolores DiVizio', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Keith Syson Chan', 'Olga Rasorenova', 'Anne Cress', 'Danislav Spassov', 'Mark Moasser', 'Edwin M Posadas', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Michael R Freeman', 'Jie J Zheng', 'Beatrice S Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['Regulation of inside-out β1-integrin activation by CDCP1.', 'HPW-RX40 restores anoikis sensitivity of human breast cancer cells by inhibiting integrin/FAK signaling.', 'Focal adhesion kinase controls aggressive phenotype of androgen-independent prostate cancer.', 'Role of focal adhesion kinase in integrin signaling.', 'Roles of CUB domain-containing protein 1 signaling in cancer invasion and metastasis.', 'Relationship Between CNVs and Immune Cells Infiltration in Gastric Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Genomic profiling of SAFB1-silenced PCa cells indicated that SAFB1 may play a role in modulating intracrine androgen levels through the regulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) genes, which inactivate steroid hormones. Gene silencing of SAFB1 resulted in increased levels of free dihydrotesterosterone (DHT), and increased resistance to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide. SAFB1 silencing suppressed expression of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 2 member B15 gene (UGT2B15) and the closely related UGT2B17 gene, which encode proteins that irreversibly inactivate testosterone (T) and DHT. Analysis of human data indicated that genomic loss at the SAFB locus, or down-regulation of expression of the SAFB gene, is associated with aggressive PCa.

BAT has been shown to induce clinical responses in a significant proportion of patients, some of which are extreme. We explored the clinical and molecular characteristics of patients with mCRPC who achieved deep responses to BAT.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with mCRPC treated with BAT at Johns Hopkins. We identified 22 of 114 (19%) patients with mCRPC who achieved ≥70% PSA reductions upon treatment with BAT. All patients were treated using 400 mg testosterone cypionate intramuscularly every 28 days, together with continuous LHRH agonist therapy. Clinical-grade DNA sequencing was obtained using commercially available assays.  Results:   Somatic next-generation sequencing was obtained for 15 of 22 (68%) patients. Of these 15 extreme PSA responders with sequencing data available, All 15 of 15 (100%) harbored a pathogenic mutation in TP53 and/or a homologous recombination DNA repair (HRD) gene.

The median radiographic progression-free survival of these deep PSA responders was 11.3 months (95% CI, 7.9-25.0 months).  Conclusions:   We observed an enrichment of TP53 and HRD mutations in mCRPC patients with extreme PSA responses to BAT, with durability lasting about a year.

Differences in oncological outcomes were mainly seen in the group with high D'Amico risk, with a lower risk of positive surgical margins (21% vs 34%), biochemical recurrence (51% vs 69%), and PCSM (14/220 vs 11/77) for RALP versus RRP. The main limitation is the nonrandomised design.  Conclusions:   In this prospective multicentre controlled trial, PCSM at 8 yr after surgery was lower for RALP in comparison to RRP. A causal relationship between surgical technique and mortality cannot be inferred, but the result confirms that RALP is oncologically safe. Taken together with better short-term results reported elsewhere, our findings confirm that implementation of RALP may continue.  Patient summary:   Our study comparing two surgical techniques for removal of the prostate for localised prostate cancer shows that a robot-assisted minimally invasive technique is safe in the long term. Together with previous results showing some better short-term effects with this approach, our findings support continued use of robot-assisted surgery.""","""['Anna Lantz', 'David Bock', 'Olof Akre', 'Eva Angenete', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Stefan Carlsson', 'Katarina Koss Modig', 'Martin Nyberg', 'Karin Stinesen Kollberg', 'Gunnar Steineck', 'Johan Stranne', 'Peter Wiklund', 'Eva Haglind']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Anna Lantz, David Bock, Olof Akre, et al.

This work examines the potential of RALA, a short amphipathic peptide, to enhance the uptake efficiency of negatively charged AuNPs in tumour cells, detailing the subsequent impact of AuNP internalisation on tumour cell radiation sensitivity.  Results:   RALA/Au nanoparticles were formed by optimising the ratio of RALA to citrate capped AuNPs, with assembly occurring through electrostatic interactions. Physical nanoparticle characteristics were determined by UV-vis spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering. Nano-complexes successfully formed at w:w ratios > 20:1 (20 µg RALA:1 µg AuNP) yielding positively charged nanoparticles, sized < 110 nm with PDI values < 0.52. ICP-MS demonstrated that RALA enhanced AuNP internalisation by more than threefold in both PC-3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell models, without causing significant toxicity. Importantly, all RALA-AuNP formulations significantly increased prostate cancer cell radiosensitivity. This effect was greatest using the 25:1 RALA-AuNP formulation, producing a dose enhancement effect (DEF) of 1.54 in PC3 cells. Using clinical radiation energies (6 MV) RALA-AuNP also significantly augmented radiation sensitivity. Mechanistic studies support RALA-AuNP nuclear accumulation resulting in increased DNA damage yields.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to demonstrate meaningful radiosensitisation using low microgram AuNP treatment concentrations. This effect was achieved using RALA, providing functional evidence to support our previous imaging study indicating RALA-AuNP nuclear accumulation.""","""['Lindsey A Bennie', 'Jie Feng', 'Christopher Emmerson', 'Wendy B Hyland', 'Kyle B Matchett', 'Helen O McCarthy', 'Jonathan A Coulter']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['Multifunctional targeted therapy system based on (99m) Tc/(177) Lu-labeled gold nanoparticles-Tat(49-57)-Lys(3) -bombesin internalized in nuclei of prostate cancer cells.', 'Hyaluronan-Metal Gold Nanoparticle Hybrids for Targeted Tumor Cell Therapy.', 'Quantifying Radiosensitization of PSMA-Targeted Gold Nanoparticles on Prostate Cancer Cells at Megavoltage Radiation Energies by Monte Carlo Simulation and Local Effect Model.', 'Protein-gold nanoparticle interactions and their possible impact on biomedical applications.', 'Functionalized radioactive gold nanoparticles in tumor therapy.', 'Alleviating the hypoxic tumor microenvironment with MnO2-coated CeO2 nanoplatform for magnetic resonance imaging guided radiotherapy.', 'Current applications of nanomaterials in urinary system tumors.']"""

Methods:   This study included AS patients with biopsy-proven PCa with a minimum of two consecutive MR examinations and at least one repeat targeted biopsy. Tumour volumes, largest axial two-dimensional (2D) surface areas, and maximum diameters were measured on T2 weighted images (T2WI). ADC values were derived from the whole lesions, 2D areas, and small-volume regions of interest (ROIs) where tumours were most conspicuous. Areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) were calculated for combinations of T2WI and ADC parameters with optimal specificity and sensitivity.  Results:   60 patients (30 progressors and 30 non-progressors) were included. In progressors, T2WI-derived tumour volume, 2D surface area, and maximum tumour diameter had a median increase of +99.5%,+55.3%, and +21.7% compared to +29.2%,+8.1%, and +6.9% in non-progressors (p < 0.005 for all).

Material and methods:   30 patients with PCa and a visible dominant intraprostatic lesion (DIL) identified on mpMRI were included in a prospective Phase II trial. Matching point registration of planning CT and T2W, diffusion-weighted and a gradient-recalled echo (GRE) MRI images made in treatment position was used for prostate and tumour delineation. Treatment consisted on 35 daily fractions of 2.17 Gy with a concomitant focal boost to the DIL of 2.43 Gy using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) with intraprostatic fiducial markers. Biochemical failure was analysed using PSA nadir +2 ng/mL criteria and local control using mpMRI evaluation at 6-9 months following RT. Acute and late toxicity were defined according to CTCAE v.4.0 and RTOG/EORTC scales and QoL was assessed using IPSS, EPIC short-form and UCLA-PCI questionnaires.  Results:   The median radiation dose to the prostate was 77.6 Gy (IQR 77.3-78.1), and to the DIL was 85.5 Gy (IQR 85.0-86.0). With a median follow up of 30.0 months (IQR 25.5-40.27), all patients remain free of biochemical relapse. An mpMRI complete response was observed in 25 patients during the first post-treatment evaluation at 6 months. The remaining five patients achieved a complete disappearance of the DIL both on T2 and DWI on the second mpMRI performed at 9 months following treatment. Six out of 30 (20%) patients presented acute Grade 2 urinary toxicity with no Grade 3 acute complications. Acute rectal toxicity was only found in 2 (6.6%) patients (both Grade 1). Only late Grade 1 urinary and rectal complications were observed in 3/30 patients, respectively, with no Grade 2 or more late toxicity. The urinary, bowel and sexual bother EPIC scores were slightly and insignificantly increased in the first 3 months post-treatment, returning to normal afterwards.

To clarify the puzzle, ER SDEO was extracted and further resolved into six isolated fractions ERF1-F6 with Sephadex LH-20 gel filtration chromatography to analyze their biological activities. Active ingredients in the isolated fractions were analyzed with GC-MS. Potential isolated fractions were selected to treat PC-3 cells with direct action and indirect treatment by mouse splenocyte- (SCM) and macrophage-conditioned media (MCM). The relationship between PC-3 cell viabilities and corresponding total polyphenols, flavonoid contents as well as Th1/Th2 cytokine profiles in SCM was analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (r). As a result, ERF1-F3 was abundant in total polyphenols and flavonoids contents with diverse active ingredients. Treatments with ERF1-F3 at appropriate concentrations more or less inhibit PC-3 cell growth in a direct action manner. Only SCM, respectively, cultured with ER SDEO and ERF1-F3 markedly enhanced the effects to inhibit PC-3 cell growth, suggesting that secretions by splenocytes might involve anti-PC-3 effects. There are significantly negative correlations between PC-3 cell viabilities and IL-2, IL-10 as well as IL-10/IL-2 ratios in the corresponding SCM. Total polyphenol and flavonoid contents in the media cultured with ER SDEO isolated fractions positively correlated with IL-10 (Th2) and IL-10/IL-2 (Th2/Th1) cytokine secretion ratios by splenocytes, indicating that polyphenol and flavonoid components in ER SDEO isolated fractions promote Th2-polarized and anti-inflammatory characteristics. These new findings concluded that the inhibitory effects against PC-3 prostate cancer cell growth are attributed to active anti-inflammatory ingredients in ER SDEO and its active ERF1-F3 fractions through direct action and indirect treatment by modulating splenocytes' cytokine secretion profiles.""","""['Tzu-He Yeh', 'Jin-Yuarn Lin']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Curr Issues Mol Biol""","""['Acorus gramineusand and Euodia ruticarpa Steam Distilled Essential Oils Exert Anti-Inflammatory Effects Through Decreasing Th1/Th2 and Pro-/Anti-Inflammatory Cytokine Secretion Ratios In Vitro.', 'Immune Cell-Conditioned Media Suppress Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cell Growth Correlating With Decreased Proinflammatory/Anti-inflammatory Cytokine Ratios in the Media Using 5 Selected Crude Polysaccharides.', 'Pharmacological Effects of Guava (Psidium guajava L.)

PI-RADS v2.1 allows for determining volume via segmentation or ellipsoid calculation. The purpose of our study was to compare ellipsoid and segmentation volume calculation methods and evaluate if PSAd diagnostic performance is altered.  Methods:   We retrospectively assessed 397 patients (mean age/standard deviation: 63.7/7.4 years) who underwent MRI and prostate biopsy or prostatectomy, with Pca classified by Gleason ≥3 + 4 and ≥4 + 4 disease. Prostate total volumes were determined with ellipsoid calculations (TVe) and with semi-automated segmentation (TVs), along with inter-rater reliability with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). PSAd was calculated for TVe and TVs and ROC curves were created to compare performance for Gleason ≥3 + 4 and ≥4 + 4 disease.  Results:   TVe was significantly higher than TVs (p < 0.0001), with mean TVe = 55.4 mL and TVs = 51.0 mL. ROC area under the curve for PSAd derived with TVe (0.63, 95%CI:0.59-0.68) and TVs (0.64, 95%CI:0.59-0.68) showed no significant difference for Gleason ≥3 + 4 disease (p = 0.45), but PSAd derived with TVs (0.63, 95%CI: 0.58-0.68) significantly outperformed TVe (0.61, 95%CI: 0.57-0.67) for Gleason ≥4 + 4 disease (p = 0.02). Both methods demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability with TVe with ICC of 0.93(95%CI: 0.92-0.94) and TVs with ICC of 0.98(95%CI: 0.98-0.99).  Conclusion:   Traditional ellipsoid measurements tend to overestimate total prostate volume compared to segmentation, but both methods demonstrate similar diagnostic performance of derived PSA density for PI-RADS clinically significant disease. For higher grade disease, PSAd derived from segmentation volumes demonstrates statistically significant superior performance.

Molecular profiles were retrospectively reviewed for CDK12-biallelic (CDK12-biLOF) and -monoallelic loss-of-function (CDK12-monoLOF) in a primary cohort of >9000 tumors, representing 39 cancer types, and immune epitopes were predicted from fusions detected by whole transcriptome sequencing. CDK12-biLOF was identified for 0.3% tumors overall, most frequently in prostate cancer (4.7%). CDK12-biLOF tumors had higher mean fusion rates and fusion-associated neoantigen load than CDK12-monoLOF and CDK12-WT tumors (P < 0.01). However, concurrent mismatch repair deficiency/microsatellite instability with CDK12-biLOF associated with low fusion rates. Among CDK12-biLOF tumors, fusion-associated neoantigen load was highest in prostate and ovarian cancers, which correlated with distinct immune profiles. In a validation cohort, CDK12-biLOF tumors (0.4%) exhibited high mean fusion rates, particularly for prostate and ovarian tumors. Low fusion rates in other CDK12-biLOF tumor types warrant further investigation and highlight the value of quantitative biomarkers.

It remains unknown whether extended robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (eRALP) without neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy can improve the outcomes of VHRPCa patients. We aimed to determine the feasibility and efficacy of eRALP as a form of monotherapy for VHRPCa.  Methods:   Data from 76 men who were treated with eRALP without neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy were analyzed. eRALP was performed using an extrafascial approach. Extended pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection (ePLND) included nodes above the external iliac axis, in the obturator fossa, and around the internal iliac artery up to the ureter. The outcome measures were BCR, treatment failure (defined as when the prostate-specific antigen level did not decrease to <0.1 ng/ml postoperatively), and urinary continence (UC). Kaplan-Meier, logistic regression, and Cox proportional-hazards model were used to analyze the data.  Results:   The median operative time was 246 min, and median blood loss was 50 ml. Twenty-one patients experienced postoperative complications. Median follow-up was 25.2 months; 19.7% of patients had treatment failure. Three-year, BCR-free survival rate was 62.0%. Castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival rate was 86.1%. Overall survival was 100%. In 55 patients who had complete postoperative UC data, 47 patients (85.5%) recovered from their UC within 12 months. Clinical stage cT3b was an independent preoperative treatment failure predictor (p = 0.035), and node positivity was an independent BCR predictor (p = 0.037). The small sample size and retrospective nature limited the study.  Conclusions:   This approach was safe and produced acceptable UC-recovery rates. Preoperative seminal vesicle invasion is associated with treatment failure, and pathological LN metastases are associated with BCR.

However, the reliability of MRgRT radiomics features is largely unknown. This study aims to investigate MRgRT radiomics feature reliability acquired using a standardized 3D-T2W-TSE sequence in terms of repeatability, reproducibility, and within-subject feature agreement on a 1.5T MR-simulator and a 1.5T MR-LINAC for prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Twenty-six consecutive PC patients who underwent one MRI-simulator scan and two MR-LINAC scans before dose delivery were retrospectively included. The three MRI datasets were rigidly co-registered. 1023 first-order and texture radiomics features were extracted with different intensity bin widths for each scan in the manually segmented clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV) by an experienced radiation oncologist. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate feature repeatability between MR-LINAC scans and reproducibility between MRI-simulator and MR-LINAC scans. The within-subject feature value agreements were evaluated using Bland-Altman analysis. The impact of inter-observer segmentation on the radiomics feature reliability was also examined based on the second manual segmentation of CTV and PTV by an MRI researcher.  Results:   Based on the segmentation by the radiation oncologist and the default bin width of 25, 9.6%, 24.1%, 49.6%, and 16.8% of the total 1023 features exhibited excellent (ICC > 0.9), good (0.9 > ICC > 0.75), moderate (0.75 > ICC > 0.5), and poor (ICC < 0.5) repeatability in the CTV, and 9.2%, 26.8%, 50.5%, and 13.5% in the PTV, respectively. For reproducibility, the corresponding feature percentages were 8.9%, 19.7%, 41.9%, and 29.6% in the CTV, and 8.4%, 17.8%, 47.9%, and 26% in the PTV. Feature reliability was not notably influenced by intensity bin width for discretization. BA analysis revealed wide 95% limit-of-agreements and substantial biases of feature values between CTV and PTV and between any two MRI scans. The features even with excellent ICC were still subjected to considerable inter-scan feature variations in each individual subject. The analysis on the second segmentation by the MRI researcher showed insignificantly different feature repeatability and reproducibility in terms of ICC values.  Conclusions:   Only a small proportion of features exhibited excellent/good repeatability and reproducibility, highlighting the importance of reliable MRgRT feature selection. The within-subject feature values were subjected to considerable inter-scan variations, imposing a challenge on the determination of the smallest detectable change in future MRgRT delta-radiomics studies.""","""['Cindy Xue', 'Jing Yuan', 'Darren Mc Poon', 'Yihang Zhou', 'Bin Yang', 'Siu Ki Yu', 'Yin Kin Cheung']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A pilot study of MRI radiomics for high-risk prostate cancer stratification in 1.5 T MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Longitudinal acquisition repeatability of MRI radiomics features: An ACR MRI phantom study on two MRI scanners using a 3D T1W TSE sequence.', 'Determining the reliable feature change in longitudinal radiomics studies: A methodological approach using the reliable change index.', 'Rectal MRI radiomics inter- and intra-reader reliability: should we worry about that?', 'A narrative review of MRI acquisition for MR-guided-radiotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'The impact of pre-processing and disease characteristics on reproducibility of T2-weighted MRI radiomics features.', 'Beyond diagnosis: is there a role for radiomics in prostate cancer management?', 'Robustness of Radiomics in Pre-Surgical Computer Tomography of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Robustness Assessment of Images From a 0.35T Scanner of an Integrated MRI-Linac: Characterization of Radiomics Features in Phantom and Patient Data.', 'Acquisition repeatability of MRI radiomics features in the head and neck: a dual-3D-sequence multi-scan study.']"""

The preliminary results showed that the 3'-O modification did not affect the cytotoxic activity of the scaffold. Analysis of the co-crystal structure and the docking pose of isorhamnetin with reported binding protein of isorhamnetin or quercetin indicated the 3'-O-substitution groups located outside of the binding pocket, which is in accordance with activity of 3'-O derivatives. Then a biotin conjugate of isorhamnetin with a tetraethylene glycol (PEG)4 linker at the 3' position was synthesized and the resulting probe retained the anti-proliferative activity on cancer cell lines, while the cellular fluorescence analysis showed the distribution of probe inside the cells which indicated the probe had limited cell permeability. Finally, pull down assay both in situ inside cells and in the cell lysates indicated the isorhamnetin biotin probe was capable of protein labeling in cell lysates.

The presence of prostatic stromal invasion in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer upstages the disease, necessitating cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent cystroprostatectomy. However, the identification of prostatic stromal invasion can be challenging, especially in biopsy and transurethral resection specimens. We assess the utility of D2-40, CK5/6, and high-molecular-weight cytokeratin (HMWCK) immunohistochemistry as an ancillary tool to differentiate prostatic stromal invasion from intraductal UC spread. We reviewed 13 cystoprostatectomies performed for UC with prostatic involvement. The presence of stromal invasion was histologically determined by the presence of circumferential retraction artifact, paradoxical differentiation, complex architecture, and desmoplastic reaction. The areas of interest were subsequently stained with D2-40, CK5/6, and HMWCK (clone 34βE12). Four bladder biopsies were used as a control to assess labeling in the benign urothelium. Nine cases had histologic evidence of prostatic stromal invasion (4 transmurally through bladder wall). D2-40 highlighted basal cells in all benign prostatic ducts and was consistently negative in UC, benign urothelium, prostatic adenocarcinoma, and benign luminal prostatic epithelium. D2-40 and CK5/6 performed similarly for intraductal UC, labeling only the basal cell layer with the exception of 1 case with squamous differentiation where CK5/6 exhibited full thickness staining. HMWCK diffusely stained 9 of 10 intraductal UCs without squamous differentiation and 1 intraductal UC with squamous differentiation. All 8 cases of invasive UC without squamous differentiation were negative for D2-40. Seven of these cases had focal CK5/6 and diffuse HMWCK staining. In 1 case of invasive UC with squamous differentiation, all stains were positive. D2-40 is expressed in prostatic basal cells, but it is not expressed in the benign or neoplastic urothelium. D2-40 and CK5/6 effectively highlight the intraductal spread of UC. While invasive UC is negative for D2-40, CK5/6 is usually patchy and localized to the periphery of the tumor nests. HMWCK often demonstrates diffuse staining in both scenarios. However, these stains do not perform well in cases of UC with squamous differentiation. Thus, D2-40 can be used as an ancillary tool to rule out prostatic stromal invasion.""","""['Oleksii A Iakymenko', 'Laurence M Briski', 'Katiana S Delma', 'Merce Jorda', 'Oleksandr N Kryvenko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Double cocktail immunostains with high molecular weight cytokeratin and GATA-3: useful stain to discriminate in situ involvement of prostatic ducts or acini from stromal invasion by urothelial carcinoma in the prostate.', 'High molecular weight cytokeratin antibody (clone 34betaE12): a sensitive marker for differentiation of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma from prostate cancer.', 'Utility of GATA-3 and Cytokeratin 5/6 Immunostains in Separating Condyloma Acuminatum Arising in the Urinary Tract From Non-Invasive Papillary Urothelial Carcinoma.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.', 'Prostatic involvement by urothelial carcinoma in patients with bladder cancer and their implications in the clinical practice.']"""

Methods:   The estimated national incidence and mortality rates are based on statistical methodology previously applied and verified using the most recently collected incidence data from 151 population-based cancer registries, mortality data and 2020 population estimates.  Results:   Estimates reveal 4 million new cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.9 million cancer-related deaths. The most common cancers are: breast in women (530,000 cases), colorectum (520,000), lung (480,000) and prostate (470,000). These four cancers account for half the overall cancer burden in Europe. The most common causes of cancer deaths are: lung (380,000), colorectal (250,000), breast (140,000) and pancreatic (130,000) cancers. In EU-27, the estimated new cancer cases are approximately 1.4 million in males and 1.2 million in females, with over 710,000 estimated cancer deaths in males and 560,000 in females.  Conclusion:   The 2020 estimates provide a basis for establishing priorities in cancer-control measures across Europe. The long-established role of cancer registries in cancer surveillance and the evaluation of cancer control measures remain fundamental in formulating and adapting national cancer plans and pan-European health policies. Given the estimates are built on recorded data prior to the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they do not take into account the impact of the pandemic.""","""['Tadeusz Dyba', 'Giorgia Randi', 'Freddie Bray', 'Carmen Martos', 'Francesco Giusti', 'Nicholas Nicholson', 'Anna Gavin', 'Manuela Flego', 'Luciana Neamtiu', 'Nadya Dimitrova', 'Raquel Negrão Carvalho', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Manola Bettio']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: Estimates for 40 countries and 25 major cancers in 2018.', 'Cancer incidence and mortality patterns in Europe: estimates for 40 countries in 2012.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Estimates of cancer incidence and mortality in Europe in 1995.', 'Cancer, cigarette smoking and premature death in Europe: a review including the Recommendations of European Cancer Experts Consensus Meeting, Helsinki, October 1996.', 'Prognostic and immune infiltrative biomarkers of CENPO in pan-cancer and its relationship with lung adenocarcinoma cell proliferation and metastasis.', 'Darolutamide: A Review in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Molecular classification of urothelial bladder carcinoma.', 'New approach methodologies to facilitate and improve the hazard assessment of non-genotoxic carcinogens-a PARC project.', 'Auxiliary Diagnosis and Prognostic Value of Dehydrogenase/Reductase 2 (DHRS2) in Various Tumors.']"""

During unperturbed growth, cells maintain balanced levels of SUMO conjugates. In contrast, eukaryotic cells that are exposed to proteotoxic and genotoxic insults mount a cytoprotective SUMO stress response (SSR). One hallmark of the SSR is a rapid and massive increase of SUMO conjugates in response to oxidative, thermal, and osmotic stress. Here, we use a recombinant fluorescent SUMO biosensor, KmUTAG-fl, to investigate differences in the SSR in a normal human prostate epithelial cell line immortalized with SV40 (PNT2) and two human prostate cancer cell lines that differ in aggressiveness and response to androgen (LNCaP and PC3). In cells that grow unperturbed, SUMO is enriched in the nuclei of all three cell lines. However, upon 30 min of exposure to ultraviolet radiation or oxidative stress, we detected significant cytosolic enrichment of SUMO as measured by KmUTAG-fl staining. This rapid enrichment in cytosolic SUMO levels was on average fivefold higher in the LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal immortalized PNT2 cells. Additionally, this enhanced enrichment of cytosolic SUMO was reversible as cells recovered from stress exposure. Our study validates the use of the fluorescent KmUTAG-fl SUMO biosensor to detect differences of SUMO levels and localization between normal and cancer cells and provides new evidence that cancer cells may exhibit an enhanced SSR.""","""['Rui Yin', 'Jiacheng Song', 'Aurora Esquela-Kerscher', 'Oliver Kerscher']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['SUMO-3 enhances androgen receptor transcriptional activity through a sumoylation-independent mechanism in prostate cancer cells.', 'SUMO targeting of a stress-tolerant Ulp1 SUMO protease.', 'Localization of SUMO-modified Proteins Using Fluorescent Sumo-trapping Proteins.', 'SUMO and ischemic tolerance.', 'Immortalized and tumorigenic adult human prostatic epithelial cell lines: characteristics and applications.

We measured resting serum myokine levels before and after an exercise-based intervention and the effect of this serum on prostate cancer cell growth.  Methods:   Ten prostate cancer patients undertaking androgen deprivation therapy (age, 73.3 ± 5.6 yr) undertook a 12-wk exercise-based intervention including supervised resistance training, self-directed aerobic exercise, and protein supplementation. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and muscle strength by the one-repetition maximum method. Fasting blood was collected at baseline and postintervention, and serum levels of myokines-secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine, oncostatin M (OSM), decorin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3)-were measured. The growth of the prostate cancer cell line DU145 with baseline and postintervention serum was measured.  Results:   Body weight (P = 0.011), fat mass (P = 0.012), and percent body fat (P = 0.033) were reduced, whereas percent lean mass (P = 0.001) increased, as did strength (leg press, P = 0.006; chest press, P = 0.020) across the intervention. Serum OSM levels (P = 0.020) and relative serum OSM levels (P = 0.020) increased compared with baseline. A significant reduction in DU145 Cell Index (P = 0.012) and growth rate (P = 0.012) was observed after applying postintervention serum compared with baseline serum.

The present study was designed to initiate this verification in real-world Japanese clinical practice.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 312 patients with high-risk mHSPC based on LATITUDE criteria and had received ADT with bicalutamide (n = 212) or abiraterone acetate (n = 100) between September 2015 and December 2020. Bicalutamide was given at 80 mg daily and abiraterone was given at 1000 mg daily as four 250-mg tablets plus prednisolone (5-10 mg daily). Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) were compared. The prognostic factor for time to CRPC was analyzed by Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   Patients in the bicalutamide group were older, and more of them had poor performance status (≧2), than in the abiraterone group. Impaired liver function was noted in 2% of the bicalutamide group and 16% of the abiraterone group (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 22.5 months for bicalutamide and 17 months for abiraterone (p < 0.001). Two-year OS and CSS for bicalutamide versus abiraterone was 77.8% versus 79.5% (p = 0.793) and 81.1% versus 82.5% (p = 0.698), respectively. Median time to CRPC was significantly longer in the abiraterone group than in the bicalutamide group (NA vs. 13 months, p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, Gleason score ≧9, high alkaline phosphatase, high lactate dehydrogenase, liver metastasis, and bicalutamide were independent prognostic risk factors for time to CRPC. Abiraterone prolonged the time to CRPC in patients with each of these prognostic factors.  Conclusions:   Despite limitations regarding the time-dependent bias, ADT with abiraterone acetate significantly prolonged the time to CRPC compared to bicalutamide in patients with high-risk mHSPC.

Methods:   In this IRB-approved retrospective study, 67 patients (mean age 71 ± 7 years; range: 55-84 years) showing a total of 205 68 Ga-PSMA-positive prostate cancer bone metastases in the thoraco-lumbar spine and pelvic bone being invisible in CT were included. Metastases and 86 68 Ga-PSMA-negative bone volumes in the same body region were segmented and further post-processed. Intra- and inter-reader reproducibility was assessed, with ICCs < 0.90 being considered non-reproducible. To account for imbalances in the dataset, data augmentation was performed to achieve improved class balance and to avoid model overfitting. The dataset was split into training, test, and validation set. After a multi-step dimension reduction process and feature selection process, the 11 most important and independent features were selected for statistical analyses.  Results:   A gradient-boosted tree was trained on the selected 11 radiomic features in order to classify patients' bones into bone metastasis and normal bone using the training dataset. This trained model achieved a classification accuracy of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.76-0.92, p < .001) with 78% sensitivity and 93% specificity.

Using microarray data from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (GSE65485) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, VPS9D1-AS1 expression in HCC and normal liver tissue sample HCC were compared. Relative lncRNA expression was also measured through real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) in 80 pairs of HCC tumor and paracancerous tissues and in human HCC cell lines. VPS9D1-AS1 knockdown was achieved by transfecting these HCC cells with a specific siRNA construct in vitro, and the proliferation of these cells was quantified through cell proliferation assays and colony formation assays, while flow cytometry was employed to assess their cell cycle progression. The role of the VPS9D1-AS1 lncRNA as a regulator of HCC tumorigenesis was also assessed in vivo by subcutaneously implanting BALB/c nude mice with HepG2 cells stably expressing either sh-VPS9D1-AS1 or a control shRNA construct. Mechanistic analyses were additionally conducted by examining in vitro CDK4 and HuR expression through western blotting and qPCR. VPS9D1-AS1 expression was significantly increased in HCC tissues in the analyzed databases and our independent tissue samples. Elevated VPS9D1-AS1 expression was related to larger tumor size and more advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage, and HCC patients expressing higher levels of this lncRNA exhibited poorer survival outcomes. Knocking down VPS9D1-AS1 impaired the proliferative and colony formation activity of HepG2 cells while promoting their apoptotic death. Consistently, VPS9D1-AS1 silencing suppressed HCC tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, VPS9D1-AS1 was able to bind to the HuR protein and thereby influence the stability and expression of the CDK4 mRNA, thus impacting HCC cell proliferation. The VPS9D1-AS1/HuR/CDK4 signaling axis regulates HCC tumor cell oncogenic activity, highlighting this pathway as a promising therapeutic target.""","""['Ning Zhou', 'Sheng Li', 'Deming Wu', 'Fan Zhang', 'Futian Tang', 'Yumin Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""DNA Cell Biol""","""['Down-regulated lncRNA TP73-AS1 reduces radioresistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the PTEN/Akt signaling pathway.', 'LncRNA LEF1-AS1 silencing diminishes EZH2 expression to delay hepatocellular carcinoma development by impairing CEBPB-interaction with CDCA7.', 'A novel lncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 promotes the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting miR-194-5p/FOXA1 axis.', 'Making Sense of Antisense lncRNAs in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'A review on the role of HAND2-AS1 in cancer.', 'Cell Cycle-Related lncRNAs as Innovative Targets to Advance Cancer Management.', 'lncSNHG3 drives breast cancer progression by epigenetically increasing CSNK2A1 expression level.', 'Molecular Mechanism of Long Noncoding RNA SNHG14 in Osteogenic Differentiation of Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells through the NEDD4L/FOXA2/PCP4 Axis.', 'Sanguinarine promotes apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via regulating the miR-497-5p/CDK4 axis.', 'A review on the role of cyclin dependent kinases in cancers.']"""

Methods:   Twenty patients with recurrent prostate cancer were enrolled. In 2 consecutive days, each patient underwent a 60-min dynamic PET/CT scan after intravenous administration of 148-185 MBq (4-5 mCi) [68 Ga]Ga-P16-093 and [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-617, respectively.

In order to improve patient outcomes, it is critical to clinically separate aggressive PCa (AG) from non-aggressive PCa (NAG). Although recent genomic studies have identified a spectrum of molecular abnormalities associated with aggressive PCa, it is still challenging to separate AG from NAG. To better understand the functional consequences of PCa progression and the unique features of the AG subtype, we studied the proteomic signatures of primary AG, NAG and metastatic PCa. 39 PCa and 10 benign prostate controls in a discovery cohort and 57 PCa in a validation cohort were analyzed using a data-independent acquisition (DIA) SWATH-MS platform. Proteins with the highest variances (top 500 proteins) were annotated for the pathway enrichment analysis. Functional analysis of differentially expressed proteins in NAG and AG was performed. Data was further validated using a validation cohort; and was also compared with a TCGA mRNA expression dataset and confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using PCa tissue microarray (TMA). 4,415 proteins were identified in the tumor and benign control tissues, including 158 up-regulated and 116 down-regulated proteins in AG tumors. A functional analysis of tumor-associated proteins revealed reduced expressions of several proteinases, including dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and prostate specific antigen (KLK3) in AG and metastatic PCa. A targeted analysis further identified that the reduced expression of DPP4 was associated with the accumulation of DPP4 substrates and the reduced ratio of DPP4 cleaved peptide to intact substrate peptide. Findings were further validated using an independently-collected tumor cohort, correlated with a TCGA mRNA dataset, and confirmed by immunohistochemical stains of PCa tumor microarray (TMA). Our study is the first large-scale proteomics analysis of PCa tissue using a DIA SWATH-MS platform. It provides not only an interrogative proteomic signature of PCa subtypes, but also indicates the critical roles played by certain proteinases during tumor progression. The spectrum map and protein profile generated in the study can be used to investigate potential biological mechanisms involved in PCa and for the development of a clinical assay to distinguish aggressive from indolent PCa.""","""['Qing Kay Li#', 'Jing Chen#', 'Yingwei Hu#', 'Naseruddin Höti', 'Tung-Shing Mamie Lih', 'Stefani N Thomas', 'Li Chen', 'Sujayita Roy', 'Alan Meeker', 'Punit Shah', 'Lijun Chen', 'G Steven Bova', 'Bai Zhang', 'Hui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['The molecular function of kallikrein-related peptidase 14 demonstrates a key modulatory role in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Use of two gene panels for prostate cancer diagnosis and patient risk stratification.', 'Random forest-based modelling to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The role of genetic markers in the management of prostate cancer.', 'ATXN3 promotes prostate cancer progression by stabilizing YAP.', 'Shared features of metaplasia and the development of adenocarcinoma in the stomach and esophagus.', 'Differentially expressed glycoproteins in pre- and post-digital rectal examination urine samples for detecting aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Novel serum proteomic biomarkers for early diagnosis and aggressive grade identification of prostate cancer.', 'Improving the detection of aggressive prostate cancer using immunohistochemical staining of protein marker panels.']"""

This study investigated the risks of developing second primary cancers that are related to first primary cancers, and the interval times of synchronous and metachronous multiple primary cancers.  Patients and methods:   Retrospective data were retrieved from 109,054 patients aged ≥18 who were diagnosed with a first solid cancer and registered at Siriraj Cancer Center between 1991 and 2015. A two-month period between first- and second- primary cancers was used to differentiate metachronous and synchronous multiple primary cancers. The combinations of subsequent cancers and relative risks (RRs) of having multiple primary cancers versus having single primary cancer for the top-ten first and second primary cancers were examined. The RR was adjusted for age of the first primary cancer. A survival analysis of the time to second-primary-cancer development was performed.  Results:   Multiple primary cancers were found in 1785 (1.63%) patients. Most (70.87%) second primary cancers occurred after 2 months of first breast, skin, colorectal, lung, head and neck, liver, male genital cancer-prostate, thyroid, and female genital cancer-non-uterine cancers, resulting in those cancers being classified as metachronous multiple primary cancer. After adjustment for age at first diagnosis, head and neck cancers had the highest metachronous association with second esophageal cancers (RR, 25.06; 95% CI, 13.41-50.77). Prostate cancer and second colorectal cancer also demonstrated a high metachronous association (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.25-3.05). A strong synchronous association was found between uterine and ovarian cancers (RR, 27.77; 95% CI, 17.97-43.63). The median time from the first uterine cancer to second-cancer development was 55 days.  Conclusions:   The top-ten most frequent multiple primary cancers were the following: breast; liver; head and neck; colorectal; male genital cancer-prostate; skin; female genital cancer-uterine; thyroid; lung; and female genital cancer-non-uterine.

The use of three-dimensional (3D) models based on mpMRI might obviate these issues. We aimed to evaluate the role of the prospective integration of 3D models from mpMRI in the robotic console in reducing the rate of positive surgical margins (PSMs). Materials and Methods: PSMs at our center are evaluated intraoperatively using the Neurovascular Structure Adjacent Frozen Section Examination method. Based on the rate of PSMs on frozen section during the year before the implementation of 3D models during surgery (22.5%), we estimated that 151 subjects were needed to detect a statistically significant difference of at least 40%. Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer (PCa) who received a 3T mpMRI at our institution and had a PIRADS ≥3 on mpMRI were included. Results: One hundred fifty-one patients were included. Overall, 17 (11.3%) patients had a PSM, 6 (35%) of them had PSM in an area where the mpMRI did not demonstrate any lesions. The rates of PSMs on both frozen (22.5% vs 11.3%) and permanent section (13.1% vs 6.6%) were significantly lower (p ≤ 0.03) compared with the cohort of patients operated during 2018 (n = 358). No significant differences among clinical characteristics were found between the study cohort and the 2018 cohort (all p > 0.05).

Materials and methods:   Of 1,685 patients who underwent extended SBx including transitional zone sampling and had TBx of ≥1 lesion in the peripheral and/or transitional zone, we selected 863 patients with exclusively peripheral PCa-suspicious lesions and negative transitional zone mpMRI. Clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was defined as Gleason score (GS) ≥3+4. Within the selected cohort we performed a retrospective head-to-head comparison of csPCa detection rates between biopsy protocols: A) combination of peripheral TBx plus extended SBx including transitional zone sampling vs B) peripheral TBx plus SBx without any transitional zone sampling. Analyses were complemented with multivariable logistic regression models (LRMs) in the total cohort for predicting csPCa in SBx transitional zone sampling.  Results:   Compared to the extended protocol (A), omission of systematic transitional zone sampling (B) yielded similar PCa detection for csPCa (48% vs 47%) and GS 3+3 (21% vs 20%). Only 2.0% csPCa was additionally detected with transitional zone SBx sampling (A). LRM confirmed that intraprostatic zonal distribution of mpMRI lesions independently influences csPCa detection rates of transitional zone SBx sampling.  Conclusions:   A peripheral TBx plus SBx without any transitional zone sampling protocol (B) yields similar csPCa detection rates as the standard extended protocol (A) but may reduce biopsy-related morbidity.

We calculated rates of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and fit multivariable Poisson models comparing the rates of PSA testing, prostate biopsy, and cancer incidence.  Results:   The mean age at enrollment was 52 years. Rates of PSA testing were lower in PWH versus uninfected comparators (0.58 versus 0.63 tests per person-year). Adjusted rates of PSA screening and prostate biopsy were lower among PWH (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-0.84 and IRR 0.79 95% CI 0.74-0.83, respectively). The crude IRR for prostate cancer was lower in PWH versus controls (IRR 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.97). However, in a multivariable model adjusting for PSA testing, cancer incidence was similar by HIV status (IRR=0.93, 95% CI 0.86-1.01, p=0.08). Among patients who received a prostate biopsy, incidence of prostate cancer did not differ significantly by HIV status (IRR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.15, p=0.15). Among incident cancers, there were significant differences in the distributions of Gleason grade (p=0.05), but not cancer stage (p=0.14) by HIV status.

While Gleason score is still one of the best indicators of clinical outcomes in PC, differences in progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with high Gleason scores suggest that additional factors are involved in tumor progression. Understanding the underlying mechanisms could help to optimize treatment strategies for an individual patient. Here, we aimed to determine the inter- and intratumoral distribution of Ki67 LI in patients with PC with high Gleason scores and to correlate Ki67 LI with the status of ERG, PTEN, and Bcl-2.  Methods:   Immunohistochemistry for Ki67, ERG, PTEN, and Bcl-2 was performed on core needle biopsies from 112 patients with newly diagnosed PC Gleason score 8, 9, and 10.  Results:   Using a cutoff of ≥10%, 17/112 cases (15%) had a homogeneously low and 95/112 cases (85%) a high Ki67 LI. 41% of cases showed intratumoral heterogeneity containing areas with low and high proliferation. There was no association between Ki67 LI and ERG, PTEN, or Bcl-2 status.  Conclusions:   Our data demonstrate major inter- and intratumoral variability of Ki67 LI in high-grade PC with a surprisingly low Ki67 LI in a subset of cases. Further studies are necessary to explore the molecular basis and potential clinical implications of a paradoxically low proliferation rate in high-grade PC.""","""['Tatjana Vlajnic', 'Patrik Brunner', 'Serenella Eppenberger-Castori', 'Cyrill A Rentsch', 'Tobias Zellweger', 'Lukas Bubendorf']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pathobiology""","""['Tumour growth fraction measured by immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 is an independent prognostic factor in preoperative prostate biopsies with small-volume or low-grade prostate cancer.', 'Ki-67 staining is an independent correlate of biochemical failure in prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.', 'Relationship of Ki-67 labeling index to DNA-ploidy, S-phase fraction, and outcome in prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Paradoxical results obtained with Ki67-labeling and PHH3-mitosis index in glial tumors: a literature analysis.', 'Deep learning-based radiomic nomograms for predicting Ki67 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell (hBMSCs)-Derived miR-29a-3p-Containing Exosomes Impede Laryngocarcinoma Cell Malignant Phenotypes by Inhibiting PTEN.']"""

Here, we demonstrate that a benzyl-substituted variant of this inhibitor exhibits improved potency in biochemical assays, is cell-permeable, and kills PCa cells at low micromolar concentrations. By X-ray crystallography and kinetics-based assays, we demonstrate that the mechanism of inhibition is complex, proceeding via competition with the enzyme for binding of active-site Fe2+ and by populating a distal site on the enzyme surface. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the inhibitor's cytostatic properties arise from direct intracellular inhibition of KDM4 enzymes.

However, this signal can be used for absolute quantification and spectral corrections. We investigated the feasibility of water-unsuppressed MRSI in patients with prostate cancer for water signal-mediated spectral quality improvement and determination of absolute tissue levels of choline.  Methods:   Eight prostate cancer patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy underwent multi-parametric MRI at 3 T, including 3D water-unsuppressed semi-LASER MRSI. A postprocessing algorithm was developed to remove the water signal and its artifacts and use the extracted water signal as intravoxel reference for phase and frequency correction of metabolite signals and for absolute metabolite quantification.  Results:   Water-unsuppressed MRSI with dedicated postprocessing produced water signal and artifact-free MR spectra throughout the prostate. In all patients, the absolute choline tissue concentration was significantly higher in tumorous than in benign tissue areas (mean ± SD: 7.2 ± 1.4 vs 3.8 ± 0.7 mM), facilitating tumor localization by choline mapping. Tumor tissue levels of choline correlated better with the commonly used (choline + spermine + creatine)/citrate ratio (r = 0.78 ± 0.1) than that of citrate (r = 0.21 ± 0.06). The highest maximum choline concentrations occurred in high-risk cancer foci.  Conclusion:   This report presents the first successful water-unsuppressed MRSI of the whole prostate. The water signal enabled amelioration of spectral quality and absolute metabolite quantification. In this way, choline tissue levels were identified as tumor biomarker. Choline mapping may serve as a tool in prostate cancer localization and risk scoring in multi-parametric MRI for diagnosis and biopsy procedures.""","""['Nassim Tayari', 'Alan J Wright', 'Arend Heerschap']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Magn Reson Med""","""['Post-acquisition water-signal removal in 3D water-unsuppressed 1 H-MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate.', 'High-Quality 3-Dimensional 1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging of the Prostate Without Endorectal Receive Coil Using A Semi-LASER Sequence.', 'Combined morphological, 1H-MR spectroscopic and contrast-enhanced imaging of human prostate cancer with a 3-Tesla scanner: preliminary experience.', 'Metabolite ratios in 1H MR spectroscopic imaging of the prostate.', 'Proton MR spectroscopy of the prostate.', 'The Integration of Metabolomics with Other Omics: Insights into Understanding Prostate Cancer.', 'Developments in proton MR spectroscopic imaging of prostate cancer.']"""

Quantitative diffusion MRI is based on acquisitions with multiple diffusion encodings followed by quantitative mapping of diffusion parameters that are sensitive to tissue microstructure. Compared to qualitative diffusion-weighted MRI, quantitative diffusion MRI can improve standardization of tissue characterization as needed for disease detection, staging, and treatment monitoring. However, similar to many other quantitative MRI methods, diffusion MRI faces multiple challenges including acquisition artifacts, signal modeling limitations, and biological variability. In abdominal and pelvic diffusion MRI, technical acquisition challenges include physiologic motion (respiratory, peristaltic, and pulsatile), image distortions, and low signal-to-noise ratio. If unaddressed, these challenges lead to poor technical performance (bias and precision) and clinical outcomes of quantitative diffusion MRI. Emerging and novel technical developments seek to address these challenges and may enable reliable quantitative diffusion MRI of the abdomen and pelvis.

These subtypes have not been described in metastatic prostate cancer.  Objectives:   To identify clinical and molecular correlates of luminal and basal subtypes in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and investigate differences in survival, particularly after treatment with androgen-signaling inhibitors (ASIs).  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cohort study, a retrospective analysis was conducted of 4 cohorts with mCRPC (N = 634) across multiple academic centers. Treatment was at the physicians' discretion. Details of the study cohorts have been published elsewhere between 2016 and 2019. Data were analyzed from March 2018 to February 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary clinical end point was overall survival from the date of tissue biopsy/molecular profiling. Luminal and basal subtypes were also stratified by postbiopsy ASI treatment. The primary molecular analyses included associations with small cell/neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNC), molecular pathways, and DNA alterations.  Results:   In the 634 patients, 288 (45%) had tumors classified as luminal, and 346 (55%) had tumors classified as basal. However, 53 of 59 (90%) SCNC tumors were basal (P < .001). Similar to primary prostate cancer, luminal tumors exhibited overexpression of AR pathway genes. In basal tumors, a significantly higher rate of RB1 loss (23% basal vs 4% luminal; P < .001), FOXA1 alterations (36% basal vs 27% luminal; P = .03) and MYC alterations (73% basal vs 56% luminal; P < .001) were identified. Patients with basal tumors had worse overall survival compared with those with luminal tumors only in patients treated with an ASI postbiopsy (East Coast Dream Team: hazard ratio [HR], 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.74; P = .004; West Coast Dream Team: HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.33-0.97; P = .04). Among patients with luminal tumors, those treated with an ASI had significantly better survival (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14-0.53; P < .001), whereas patients with basal tumors did not (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.36-1.04, P = .07). The interaction term between subtype and ASI treatment was statistically significant (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.20-0.89; P = .02).  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings represent the largest integrated clinical, transcriptomic, and genomic analysis of mCRPC samples to date, and suggest that mCRPC can be classified as luminal and basal tumors. Analogous to primary prostate cancer, these data suggest that the benefit of ASI treatment is more pronounced in luminal tumors and support the use of ASIs in this population. In the basal tumors, a chemotherapeutic approach could be considered in some patients given the similarity to SCNC and the diminished benefit of ASI therapy.

Because of the amplification of the detection signal by the as-synthesized AASp bioconjugates, the immunosensor achieved a wide linear response range (0.001 to 75.0 ng mL-1) and a low detection limit of 3.0 pg mL-1 (at S/N = 3).

Nevertheless, the accuracy of current biomarkers, such as pathological staging, Gleason's score, and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, is limited. FOXO1 is a key downstream effector of PTEN and a tumor suppressor in PCA, which has been reported extensively. However, the clinical relevance of FOXO1 in PCa remains unclear.  Methods:   In this study, we first detected its expression in four public databases to explore the clinical role of FOXO1. Verification of the knockdown effect of FOXO1 siRNA was performed by real-time PCR analysis. Changes in cell viability were assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assays. In addition, we verified the effect of FOXO1 on the PCa cell cycle using a cell cycle assay.  Results:   Herein, we found that FOXO1 was significantly downregulated in PCa tissues and was significantly associated with Gleason's score, age, biochemical recurrence (BCR), and lymph node (LN) status, while FOXO1 expression was independent of pathological staging and preoperative PSA levels. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that PCA patients with high FOXO1 expression were less likely to develop BCR compared with patients with low FOXO1 expression. In terms of function, FOXO1 inhibition significantly promoted the proliferation and cell cycle progression of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   In summary, our study suggests that FOXO1 may be one of the prognostic factors that describe the risk of PCa for BCR.

Development of a risk model for detecting sPC based on the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) for bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) and clinical parameters in a Japanese cohort is expected to prove beneficial. We retrospectively analyzed clinical parameters and bpMRI findings from 773 biopsy-naïve patients between January 2011 and December 2016. A risk model was established using multivariate logistic regression analysis and presented on a nomogram. Discrimination of the risk model was compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Statistical differences between the predictive model and clinical parameters were analyzed using DeLong test. sPC was detected in 343 men (44.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict sPC revealed age (P = 0.002), log prostate-specific antigen (P < 0.001), prostate volume (P < 0.001) and PI-RADS scores (P < 0.001) as significant contributors to the model. Area under the curve was higher for the risk model (0.862), than for age (0.646), log prostate-specific antigen (0.652), prostate volume (0.697) or imaging score (0.822). DeLong test results also showed that the novel risk model performed significantly better than those parameters (P < 0.05).

We aimed to evaluate whether prostate volume affects its prognosis. We reviewed medical records of men who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor due to non-muscle invasive bladder cancer from January 2012 to December 2017. Patients were divided into two groups based on prostate volume measured by computed tomography (group 1: 264 patients with ≤ 30 mL, group 2: 124 patients with > 30 mL). Propensity score matching analysis was used for adjust selection bias, and then assessed recurrence-free survival and progression-free survival. With a median follow up duration of 52 months, group 1 showed higher 5-year recurrence-free and progression-free survival (69.3% vs 47.0%, p = 0.001; 96.7% vs 87.7%, p = 0.002). Further, cox-regression analysis showed that tumor size (HR = 1.292 p < 0.001), multifocal tumor (HR = 1.993, p < 0.001), adjuvant intravesical therapy (chemotherapy: HR = 0.580, p = 0.037 and bacillus Calmette-Guérin: HR = 0.542, p = 0.004) and prostate volume (HR = 2.326, p < 0.001) were significant predictors of recurrence-free survival.

The project aimed to assess the potential of using stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for boost treatment of high-risk prostate cancer patients where HDR BT in combination with conformal external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is the standard of care. The datasets of 6 prostate patients previously treated with HDR BT were collated. VMAT, CK, and TomoTherapy treatment plans were generated for each dataset using the target and organ-at-risk structures as defined by the Radiation Oncologist during the HDR BT treatment process. The HDR BT plan isodoses were also converted into planning structures to assist the other modalities to achieve a HDR BT-like dose distribution. CK plans were created using both the iris collimator (IC) and a multileaf collimator (MLC). Comparison of the techniques was made based on dose-volume indices. Each plan was created at centres experienced using the respective treatment planning systems (TPS). Planning target volume (PTV V100%), i.e., the volume of the planning target volume (PTV) receiving 100% of the relative dose, in VMAT and TomoTherapy SBRT plans was higher than HDR BT plans. PTV V150% and V200%, i.e., volume of the PTV receiving 150% and 200% of the relative dose, were approached on all the CK MLC and TomoTherapy SBRT plans. However, it is not presently achievable for ""virtual brachytherapy"" SBRT to replicate the same high intraprostatic doses as HDR BT while meeting the constraints on the organs-at-risk (OARs). Half of the CK IC plans achieved PTV V150% but this was at the expense of high rectal dose. TomoTherapy and CK MLC plans achieved PTV V150% and V200% but the bladder dose was higher compared to CK IC plans. VMAT exhibited excellent PTV coverage based on V100 and OAR sparing, but without any ability to achieve the high intra-prostatic doses of HDR (V150% and V200%). SBRT techniques can be used to deliver hypofractionated radiotherapy to the PTV V100%. Based on the comparison of ""physical"" dose distributions, SBRT cannot presently achieve the same high intraprostatic doses as HDR BT while respecting the OAR constraints. SBRT still remains an attractive treatment option for delivering hypofractionated treatments for prostate cancer compared to HDR BT, in particular as it is less invasive and less resource intensive.

Low-molecular-weight (LMW) ligands are candidate targeting moieties instead of antibodies, but whether LMW-IR700 conjugates induce cell death by aggregation, the same mechanism as Ab-IR700, is unknown. Thus, we investigated differences in cytotoxicity and mechanisms between LMW-IR700 and Ab-IR700 targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). Both conjugates decreased cell viability to the same degree after light irradiation, but different morphological changes were observed in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells by microscopy. Cell swelling and bleb formation were induced by Ab-IR700, but only swelling was observed in cells treated with LMW-IR700, suggesting the cells were damaged via different cytotoxic mechanisms. However, LMW-IR700 induced bleb formation, a hallmark of NIR-PIT with Ab-IR700, when singlet oxygen was quenched or LMW-IR700 was localized only on the plasma membrane. Moreover, the water-soluble axial ligands of LMW-IR700 were cleaved, consistent with previous reports on Ab-IR700.

Several therapies have been developed to treat advanced prostate cancer, but these therapies often have severe side effects. To improve the outcome with fewer side effects we focused on the furanocoumarin bergamottin, a natural product found in grapefruit juice and a potent CYP3A inhibitor. Our recent studies have shown that CYP3A5 inhibition can block androgen receptor (AR) signaling, critical for prostate cancer growth. We observed that bergamottin reduces prostate cancer (PC) cell growth by decreasing both total and nuclear AR (AR activation) reducing downstream AR signaling. Bergamottin's role in reducing AR activation was confirmed by confocal microscopy studies and reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, which is a marker for prostate cancer. Further studies revealed that bergamottin promotes cell cycle block and accumulates G0/G1 cells. The cell cycle block was accompanied with reduction in cyclin D, cyclin B, CDK4, P-cdc2 (Y15) and P-wee1 (S642). We also observed that bergamottin triggers apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines as evident by TUNEL staining and PARP cleavage.

While localized PCa has a 5-year survival rate approaching 100%, this rate drops to 31% for metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa). Thus, timely identification of mPCa is a crucial step toward measuring and improving access to innovations that reduce PCa mortality. Yet, methods to identify patients diagnosed with mPCa remain elusive. Cancer registries provide detailed data at diagnosis but are not updated throughout treatment. This study reports on the development and validation of a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm deployed on oncology, urology, and radiology clinical notes to identify patients with a diagnosis or history of mPCa in the Department of Veterans Affairs.  Patients and methods:   Using a broad set of diagnosis and histology codes, the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse was queried to identify all Veterans with PCa. An NLP algorithm was developed to identify patients with any history or progression of mPCa. The NLP algorithm was prototyped and developed iteratively using patient notes, grouped into development, training, and validation subsets.  Results:   A total of 1,144,610 Veterans were diagnosed with PCa between January 2000 and October 2020, among which 76,082 (6.6%) were identified by NLP as having mPCa at some point during their care. The NLP system performed with a specificity of 0.979 and sensitivity of 0.919.  Conclusion:   Clinical documentation of mPCa is highly reliable. NLP can be leveraged to improve PCa data.

Early use of more intensive therapies targeting androgen receptor and other oncogenic drivers in treatment-naïve primary prostate cancer (PC) may be more effective than that in advanced mCRPC. However, analysis of primary tumors may not reveal targetable metastatic drivers that are subclonal in the primary tumor or acquired at metastatic sites.  Methods:   PC samples spanning one patient's clinical course: diagnostic biopsies, pre- or post-enzalutamide metastatic biopsies, and rapid autopsy samples including a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) were analyzed by targeted exome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis.  Results:   Left- and right-lobe primary PC tumors appeared to diverge, with the right acquiring additional shared mutations and striking differences in copy number alterations that later appeared in metastatic samples during the treatment course and at autopsy, whereas the left base tumor maintained a quiet copy number alteration landscape and partitioned into a dead-end node. RB1 loss, a common finding in advanced castration-resistant disease, was identified throughout mCRPC samples, but not in the primary tumor. Significantly, a truncal EGFR-activating mutation (R108K) was identified in the primary tumor and was also found to be maintained in the mCRPC samples and in a PDX model. Furthermore, the PDX model remained sensitive to the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib, despite the presence of both RB1 and BRCA2 losses.  Conclusion:   These findings indicate that truncal alterations identified in primary PC can drive advanced mCRPC, even in the presence of additional strong oncogenic drivers (ie, RB1 and BRCA2 loss), and suggest that earlier detection and targeting of these truncal alterations may be effective at halting disease progression.""","""['David J Einstein', 'Seiji Arai', 'Carla Calagua', 'Fang Xie', 'Olga Voznesensky', 'Brian J Capaldo', 'Christina Luffman', 'Jonathan L Hecht', 'Steven P Balk', 'Adam G Sowalsky', 'Joshua W Russo']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['Neoadjuvant-Intensive Androgen Deprivation Therapy Selects for Prostate Tumor Foci with Diverse Subclonal Oncogenic Alterations.', 'Copy Number Loss of 17q22 Is Associated with Enzalutamide Resistance and Poor Prognosis in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic Alterations in Cell-Free DNA and Enzalutamide Resistance in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.', 'Genomic Testing in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Pragmatic Guide for Clinicians.', 'Autocrine Canonical Wnt Signaling Primes Noncanonical Signaling through ROR1 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Single whole genome sequencing analysis blazes the trail for precision medicine.', 'Comment on: Intratumor heterogeneity and clonal evolution revealed in castration-resistant prostate cancer by longitudinal genomic analysis by Jing Li et\xa0al.']"""

We report a microelectronic point-of-care metabolite biomarker measurement platform and use it for prostate cancer detection. The platform, using an array of photodetectors configured to operate with targeted, multiplexed, colorimetric assays confined in monolithically integrated passive microfluidic channels, completes a combined assay of 4 metabolites in a drop of human plasma in under 2 min. A preliminary clinical study using l-amino acids, glutamate, choline, and sarcosine was used to train a cross-validated random forest algorithm.

However, the process of online adaptation currently takes approximately 45 min during which intrafractional movements remain unaccounted for. This study aims to analyze the dosimetric benefit of online adaptation and to evaluate its robustness over the duration of one treatment fraction.  Methods:   Baseline MR-scans at a MR-linear accelerator were acquired for ten healthy male volunteers for generation of mock-prostate SBRT plans with a dose prescription of 5 × 7.25 Gy. On a separate day, online MR-guided adaptation (ViewRay® MRIdian) was performed, and thereafter MR images were acquired every 15 min for 1 h to assess the stability of the adapted plan.  Results:   A dosimetric benefit of online MR-guided adaptive re-planning was observed in 90% of volunteers. The median D95CTV- and D95PTV-coverage was improved from 34.8 to 35.5 Gy and from 30.7 to 34.6 Gy, respectively. Improved target coverage was not associated with higher dose to the organs at risk, most importantly the rectum (median D1ccrectum baseline plan vs. adapted plan 33.3 Gy vs. 32.3 Gy). The benefit of online adaptation remained stable over 45 min for all volunteers. However, at 60 min, CTV-coverage was below a threshold of 32.5 Gy in 30% of volunteers (30.6 Gy, 32.0 Gy, 32.3 Gy).  Conclusion:   The dosimetric benefit of MR-guided online adaptation for prostate SBRT was robust over 45 min in all volunteers.

Clinical image reporting relies predominantly on observer-dependent visual assessment and easily accessible measures like SUVmax, representing lesion uptake in a relatively small amount of tissue. Our hypothesis is that measurements of total volume and lesion uptake of the entire tumour would better reflect the disease`s activity with prognostic significance, compared with conventional measurements.  Methods:   An AI-based algorithm was trained to automatically measure the prostate and its tumour content in PET/CT of 145 patients. The algorithm was then tested retrospectively on 285 high-risk patients, who were examined using 18F-choline PET/CT for primary staging between April 2008 and July 2015. Prostate tumour volume, tumour fraction of the prostate gland, lesion uptake of the entire tumour, and SUVmax were obtained automatically. Associations between these measurements, age, PSA, Gleason score and prostate cancer-specific survival were studied, using a Cox proportional-hazards regression model.  Results:   Twenty-three patients died of prostate cancer during follow-up (median survival 3.8 years). Total tumour volume of the prostate (p = 0.008), tumour fraction of the gland (p = 0.005), total lesion uptake of the prostate (p = 0.02), and age (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with disease-specific survival, whereas SUVmax (p = 0.2), PSA (p = 0.2), and Gleason score (p = 0.8) were not.

However, the role of DEFB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) still needs to be elucidated.  Methods:   Quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to measure the expression levels of interested proteins. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were performed to determine the ability of cell proliferation. Tumor formation experiments in nude mice were used to examine the tumor growth.  Results:   The expression level of DEFB1 was dramatically downregulated in human HCC. Quantitative PCR and Western blot results also showed a pronounced decrease of DEFB1 expression in the liver cancer cell lines. Rescuing the expression of DEFB1 in Huh7 cells effectively suppressed cell proliferation and reduced the colony forming ability, probably by inducing cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Moreover, tumor formation experiments in nude mice also showed inhibition of tumor growth by DEFB1 expression in vivo. Furthermore, induction of DEFB1 expression induced degraded protein increase and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which subsequently activated JNK pathway. Pharmacologic inhibition of ER stress by 4-phenylbutyrate, a compound to alleviate ER stress, effectively eliminated DEFB1-induction inhibition of cell proliferation and migration.  Conclusion:   DEFB1 functions as a tumor suppressor in HCC through activating ER stress and JNK pathway, which may provide a potential strategy for HCC treatment.""","""['Xinhong Li', 'Wanying Song', 'Mingyu Zhang', 'Pengwei Zhao']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J BUON""","""['Endoplasmic reticulum stress triggers Xanthoangelol-induced protective autophagy via activation of JNK/c-Jun Axis in hepatocellular carcinoma.', '9-bis2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxy-6-{4-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethoxyphenyl}-11H-indeno1, 2-cquinolin-11-one (BPIQ), A Quinoline Derivative Inhibits Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells by Inducing ER Stress and Apoptosis.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINC01503 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma via activating MAPK/ERK pathway.', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress: Multiple regulatory roles in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'CCL23 in Balancing the Act of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Antitumor Immunity in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Role of Defensins in Tumor Biology.']"""

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the urinary metabolic differences in male patients with PCa (n = 24), BCa (n = 29), and RCC (n = 12) to find the prominent combination of metabolites between cancers. Based on 1H NMR analysis, orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis was applied to find distinct metabolites among cancers. Moreover, the ranked analysis of covariance by adjusting a potential confounding as age revealed that 4-hydroxybenzoate, N-methylhydantoin, creatinine, glutamine, and acetate had significantly different metabolite levels among groups. The receiver operating characteristic analysis created by prominent five metabolites showed the great discriminatory accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) > 0.7 for BCa vs. RCC, PCa vs. BCa, and RCC vs. PCa.

Patient prognosis varies depending on the subtype of leukemia as well as eligibility for intensive treatment regimens and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Although significant progress has been made in the therapy of patients including novel targeted treatment approaches, there is still an urgent need to optimize treatment outcome. The most common therapy is based on the use of chemotherapeutics cytarabine and anthrayclines. Here, we studied the effect of the recently synthesized marine alkaloid 3,10-dibromofascaplysin (DBF) in myeloid leukemia cells. Unsubstituted fascaplysin was early found to affect cell cycle via inhibiting CDK4/6, thus we compared the activity of DBF and other brominated derivatives with known CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, which was earlier shown to be a promising candidate to treat leukemia. Unexpectedly, the effect DBF on cell cycle differs from palbociclib. In fact, DBF induced leukemic cells apoptosis and decreased the expression of genes responsible for cancer cell survival. Simultaneously, DBF was found to activate the E2F1 transcription factor. Using bioinformatical approaches we evaluated the possible molecular mechanisms, which may be associated with DBF-induced activation of E2F1. Finally, we found that DBF synergistically increase the cytotoxic effect of cytarabine in different myeloid leukemia cell lines.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of prior cancer on the prognosis of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and to describe their characteristics.  Materials and methods:   Data of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The discrepancy in baseline characteristics was adjusted by propensity score matching. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess the impact of prior cancer on overall survival.  Results:   A total of 3412 individuals were identified, of which 418 (12.25%) had prior cancer. Prostate cancer was the most frequently detected type of prior cancer (18.42%). Nearly 45% of the prior cancers were diagnosed within 5 years before the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients with prior cancer had an inferior survival compared to those without prior cancer (p < 0.001). Notably, patients with prior prostate, breast, hematological, and nasopharyngeal cancers had a non-inferior overall survival. Prior cancer history was an independent factor of poor overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.329, p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   This is the first study to provide the comprehensive insight that patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and prior cancer have lower overall survival.

In the presence of TGFβ, rapamycin induces G1 cell cycle arrest; however, in the absence of TGFβ, cells do not arrest in G1 and progress into S-phase where rapamycin is cytotoxic rather than cytostatic. However, we observed that DU145 prostate and NCI-H2228 lung cancer cells were resistant to the cytotoxic effect of rapamycin. Of interest, the rapamycin-resistant DU145 and NCI-H2228 cells have mutations in the RB and CDKN2A tumor suppressor genes. The gene products of RB and CDKN2A (pRb and p14ARF) suppress E2F family transcription factors that promote cell cycle progression from G1 into S. Restoration of wild type RB or inhibition of E2F activity in DU145 and NCI-H2228 cells led to rapamycin sensitivity.

Herein, we evaluated use of curative treatment between Black and White elderly men with aggressive PCa in a large US database.  Methods:   Men ≥80 years diagnosed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network-defined high risk PCa between 2004 and 2016 were analyzed from the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model the effect of race and sociodemographic factors on receipt of definitive therapy (surgery or radiation +/- androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) versus non-definitive therapy (ADT alone or observation) in inverse probability weighted groups matched for stage, prostate-specific antigen, and Gleason score.  Results:   Between 2004 and 2016, utilization of definitive therapy with either surgery or radiation therapy increased in both White and Black men in the United States. However, we found that Black men compared with White men were significantly less likely to receive definitive therapy (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79, p < .001).

Methods:   This is a retrospective cohort study of all operative interventions for spinal metastasis in a tertiary referral centre over eight years. Primary spinal tumours and local invasion to the spine were excluded. Median follow up was 1895 days.  Results:   225 operative procedures in 196 patients with spinal metastasis were performed over eight years. Average cases per year increased form 20 per year to 29 per year. Percutaneous procedures became more common, accounting for the majority (53%) in the final two years. The most common primary types were breast, myeloma, lung, prostate and renal. Overall survival at 1 year was 51%. Primary type was a major determinant of survival, with breast and the haematological cancers demonstrating good survival, while lung had the worst prognosis.  Conclusion:   This is the first descriptive cohort of operative interventions for spinal metastasis in an Irish context. Surgery for spinal metastasis is performed at an increasing rate, especially through minimally-invasive means. The majority of patients survive for at least one year post-operatively.

Methods:   Participants from the QSKIN Sun and Health prospective cohort Study with a histologically confirmed breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, or prostate cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 were included (n = 1965). Medicare claims data on out-of-pocket expenses were analysed using a two-part model adjusted for year of diagnosis, health insurance status, age and education level. Fisher price and quantity indexes were also calculated to assess prices and volumes separately.  Results:   On average, patients with cancer diagnosed in 2015 spent 70% more out-of-pocket on direct medical expenses than those diagnosed in 2011. Out-of-pocket expenses increased significantly for patients with breast cancer (mean AU$2513 in 2011 to AU$6802 in 2015). Out-of-pocket expenses were higher overall for individuals with private health insurance. For prostate cancer, expenses increased for those without private health insurance over time (mean AU$1586 in 2011 to AU$4748 in 2014) and remained stable for those with private health insurance (AU$4397 in 2011 to AU$5623 in 2015). There were progressive increases in prices and quantities of medical services for patients with melanoma, breast and lung cancer. For all cancers, prices increased for medicines and doctor attendances but fluctuated for other medical services.  Conclusion:   Out-of-pocket expenses for patients with cancer have increased substantially over time. Such increases were more pronounced for women with breast cancer and those without private health insurance.

We also confirmed that panobinostat could overcome the resistance for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Further, we combined panobinostat with Ad-hepaCAM, which resulted in significantly increased antitumor activity and significant attenuation of the proliferation-associated genes CCND1 and PCNA compared to each single treatment. In conclusion, panobinostat may enhance the acetylation of lys9 of histone 3 and reverse the hepaCAM expression through its inhibitory effect on HDACs activity in PCa LNCaP and DU145 cells; Ad-hepaCAM combined with panobinostat may synergistically inhibit the growth of LNCaP and DU145 cells, via a potential mechanism associated with the down-regulation of the expression of CCND1 and PCNA. These findings suggest that this therapeutic strategy should be further developed in clinical trials.""","""['E Chen', 'NanJing Liu', 'Yan Zhao', 'Min Tang', 'LiPing Ou', 'XiaoHou Wu', 'ChunLi Luo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Gene""","""['The prostate cancer blocking potential of the histone deacetylase inhibitor LBH589 is not enhanced by the multi receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor TKI258.', 'Role of class I histone deacetylases in the regulation of maspin expression in prostate cancer.', 'Seleno-aspirin compound AS-10 promotes histone acetylation ahead of suppressing androgen receptor transcription, G1 arrest, and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Histone Deacetylase Modifications by Probiotics in Colorectal Cancer.', 'The role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in human cancer.', 'The role of protein acetylation in carcinogenesis and targeted drug discovery.', 'In vitro and in vivo anti-Toxoplasma activities of HDAC inhibitor Panobinostat on experimental acute ocular toxoplasmosis.', 'From Therapy Resistance to Targeted Therapies in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, limited information is available on the influence of cancer treatments on patients' employment status in Japan. Therefore, in this web-based survey, we aimed to compare the effects of post-treatment changes on the annual income of patients with prostate cancer after undergoing radical radiotherapy and prostatectomy and to identify the risk factors associated with the decrease in annual income. We investigated the clinical characteristics and demographics including pre-treatment working status, self-employment, non-regular employment, working for wage or salary, and joblessness of patients with localized prostate cancer. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the effects of various factors on the change in the annual income of self-employed and non-regularly employed workers. Seventy-eight eligible patients with localized prostate cancer had undergone radiotherapy, and 128 patients had undergone prostatectomy. Among self-employed and non-regularly employed workers, post-treatment income decline rates in those who underwent radiotherapy were smaller but not significant (12% vs. 42%, P = 0.074). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that initial treatment for prostate cancer was the only significant risk factor for the post-treatment income decline among self-employed and non-regularly employed workers. Radiotherapy was associated with a smaller decrease in income (odds ratio, 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.052-0.95; P = 0.042).

Results:   TCGA and clinical patient datasets indicated that NEIL3 was downregulated in CRPC and NEPC cell lines, and NEIL3 was correlated with a high Gleason score but a good prognosis. Further functional studies demonstrated that NEIL3 had no effect on the proliferation and migration of PCa cells. However, cell and animal radiotherapy models revealed that NEIL3 could facilitate the radiotherapy sensitivity of PCa cells, while loss of NEIL3 activated radiotherapy resistance.

We previously found that upregulated E-cadherin in the epithelial micrometastases activated canonical survival pathways, including PI3K-Akt, that protected the tumor cells from death; however, the extent of protection from blocking the pathway in its entirety was modest, because different isoforms may have alternately affected cell functioning. Here, we characterized Akt isoform expressions in primary and metastatic prostate cancers, as well as their individual contributions to chemoresistance.  Methods:   Akt isoforms and E-cadherin were manipulated with drugs, knocked down, and over expressed. Tumor cell killing was determined in vitro and in vivo. Overall survival was calculated from patient records and specimens.  Results:   Pan-Akt inhibition sensitized tumor cells to chemotherapy, and specific blockade of Akt1 or/and Akt2 caused cells to be more chemoresponsive. Overexpression of Akt3 induced apoptosis. A low dose of Akt1 or Akt2 inhibitor enabled standard chemotherapies to significantly eradicate metastatic prostate tumors in a mouse model, acting as chemosensitizers. In human specimens, we found Akt1 and Akt2 positively correlated, whereas Akt3 inversely correlated, with the overall survival of prostate cancer patients. Akt1high/Akt2high/Akt3low tumors had the worst outcomes.  Conclusions:   E-cadherin-induced activation of Akt1/2 isoforms was the essential mechanism of chemoresistance, whereas Akt3 made cells more fragile.

NCAPD3 is a component of the condensin II complex and plays a critical role in cell mitosis by regulating chromosome condensation; however, the relationship between NCAPD3 and AR remains unknown.  Methods:   Transcriptome sequencing assay is carried out to analyze the expression of the NCAP family in clinic samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, ChIP assay, and dual-luciferase assay are used to identify the androgen-responsive element in NCAPD3 enhancer. Immunohistochemistry, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and western-blot assay are employed to check the expression of genes in PCa tissues and in PCa cells. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy analysis is used for identifying the regulation of AR on NCAPD3-mediated chromosome condensation. Colony formation, cell cycle assay, wound healing assay, and transwell experiments are used to explore the regulation of AR on the functions of NCAPD3. In vivo experiment is employed to identify in vitro experimental results.  Results:   NCAPD3 is an androgen/AR axis-targeted gene and is involved in AR-induced PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Androgen treatment and AR overexpression increase the expression of NCAPD3 in PCa cell lines. The canonical exist in the enhancer region of NCAPD3. Androgen/AR axis regulates NCAPD3-invovled chromosome condensation during cell mitosis.

Systematic analysis of the metabolic alterations and identification of new biomarkers may benefit PCa diagnosis and a deep understanding of the pathological mechanism. The purpose of this study was to determine the metabolic features of PCa.  Methods:   Plasma and urine metabolites from 89 prostate cancer (PCa) patients, 84 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and 70 healthy males were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS. The Orthogonalised Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to find the significantly changed metabolites. The clinical value of the candidate markers was examined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared with prostate-specific antigen (PSA).  Results:   Multivariate statistical analyses found a series of altered metabolites, which related to the urea cycle, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), fatty acid metabolism, and the glycine cleavage system. Plasma Glu/Gln showed the highest predictive value (AUC = 0.984) when differentiating PCa patients from healthy controls, with a higher sensitivity than PSA (96.6% vs. 94.4%). Both Glu/Gln and PSA displayed a low specificity when differentiating PCa patients from BPH patients (<53.2%), while the combination of Glu/Gln and PSA can further increase the diagnostic specificity to 66.9%.

The present study aimed to analyze the effect of curcumol on prostate cancer and identify its possible internal regulatory pathway using in vitro cell culture and in vivo tumor model experiments. The cytotoxicity of curcumol was detected using a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and it was found that curcumol had no obvious toxicity or side effects on RWPE‑1 cells. Wound healing, Transwell and flow cytometry assays demonstrated that curcumol could affect the activity of PC3 cells. The luciferase reporter assay also indicated that microRNA (miR)‑9 could directly target pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1). After PC3 cells were transfected with miR‑9 inhibitor or treated with curcumol, the expression levels of the PDK1/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway‑related proteins [PDK1, phosphorylated (p)‑AKT and p‑mTOR] were increased or decreased, respectively. Next, the prostate cancer cell xenograft model was established. Tumor size and the expression levels of PDK1/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway‑related factors were altered following treatment with curcumol. The in vitro and in vivo experiments collectively demonstrated that curcumol could inhibit the PDK1/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway by upregulating the expression level of miR‑9. The present study found that curcumol regulates the PDK1/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway via miR‑9 and affects the development of prostate cancer.

Objectives:   We prospectively examined the association between multivitamin use and risks of overall and site-specific cancer in a large, well-characterized cohort to ascertain potential preventive or harmful relationships.  Methods:   We examined 489,640 participants ages 50-71 in the NIH-American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Diet and Health Study who were enrolled from 1995 to 1998. We linked to 11 state cancer registries in order to identify incident cancers. Multivitamin use was assessed by a baseline questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression models of multivitamin use were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for cancer risks in men and women, adjusted for potential confounders, including age, BMI, smoking, physical activity, the Healthy Eating Index 2015 score, and use of single-vitamin/-mineral supplements.  Results:   A slightly higher overall cancer risk was observed in men (but not women) who consumed 1 or more multivitamins daily compared to nonusers [HRs, 1.02 (95% CI: 1.01-1.04) and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00-1.07), respectively; P-trend = 0.002]. The latter reflected higher risks for prostate cancer (HR, 1.04; 95% CI: 0.98-1.10; P-trend = 0.005), lung cancer (HR, 1.07; 95% CI: 0.96-1.20; P-trend = 0.003), and leukemia (HR, 1.26; 95% CI: 1.02-1.57; P-trend = 0.003). Taking more than 1 multivitamin daily was also strongly positively associated with the risk of oropharyngeal cancer in women (HR, 1.53, 95% CI: 1.04-2.24; P-trend < 0.0001). By contrast, daily multivitamin use was inversely associated with the colon cancer risk in both sexes (HR, 0.82; 95% CI: 0.73-0.93; P-trend = 0.0003).  Conclusions:   We found little evidence to support a cancer-preventive role for multivitamin use, with the exception of colon cancer, in both sexes in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. In addition, slightly higher risks of overall, prostate, and lung cancer, as well as leukemia, were observed for greater multivitamin use in men, with a higher oropharyngeal cancer risk in women.""","""['Jung-Eun Lim', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Linda M Liao', 'Rashmi Sinha', 'Jiaqi Huang', 'Demetrius Albanes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""['Multivitamin use and risk of prostate cancer in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Multivitamins, individual vitamin and mineral supplements, and risk of diabetes among older U.S. adults.', 'The association between self-reported diabetes and cancer incidence in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Multivitamin Use and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Men.', 'Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and ovarian cancer risk: findings from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and systematic review.', 'Differential Biopsy Patterns Influence Associations between Multivitamin Use and Prostate Cancer Risk in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial.']"""

The exact etiology of CRF and its mechanisms are poorly understood. Cytokine dysregulation was hypothesized to be one of these mechanisms. Here, we explored the associations of soluble and extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated markers that include cytokines, heat shock proteins (hsp27, hsp70, hsp90), and neurotrophic factors (BDNF) with CRF.  Methods:   Plasma was collected from men (n ​= ​40) with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) at the start of the treatment, and three months after EBRT. CRF was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Fatigue (FACT-F) from all participants. EVs were characterized via Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis, electron microscopy, and Western blot. Concentrations of EV-associated and soluble markers were measured with a multiplexed immunoassay system. Bivariate correlation analyses and independent T tests analyzed the relationships of CRF with the markers.  Findings:   As CRF worsened, concentrations of EV-associated markers were upregulated. EV-associated fold changes of Eotaxin, hsp27, IP-10, MIP-3α, were significantly higher in fatigued participants compared to non-fatigued EBRT participants three months after treatment.

Concentrations of EV-associated CRP and MCP-1, soluble survivin, IFNα2, IL-8, IL-12p70, and MCP-1 significantly correlated with lower (worsening) CRF scores at the start of and three months after treatment.  Interpretation:   Concentrations of EV-associated markers increased in fatigued men with prostate cancer three months after EBRT. Both EV-associated and soluble markers correlated with worsening CRF.

With rising demand for and shortage of genetic counseling (GC), tools to deliver pretest informed consent across practice settings are needed to improve access to GT and precision care. Here, we report on Evaluation and Management for Prostate Oncology, Wellness, and Risk (EMPOWER), a patient-choice study for pretest video-based genetic education (VBGE) versus GC to inform urgent practice needs.  Patients and methods:   Men with PCA or at risk for PCA (family history of PCA) were eligible and could choose pretest VBGE or GC. Outcomes included decisional conflict for GT, change in genetics knowledge, satisfaction, and intention to share results with family and/or providers. Descriptive statistics summarized results with counts and percentages for categorical variables and mean ± standard deviation for continuous variables. Data were compared with Fisher's exact, chi-squared, or Wilcoxon two-sample tests. Mean change in genetics knowledge was compared with t tests. The significance level was set a priori at .05.  Results:   Data on the first 127 participants were analyzed. Characteristics were White (85.8%), bachelor's degree (66.9%), and PCA diagnosis (90.6%). The majority chose VBGE (71%) versus GC (29%; P < .001). No differences were observed in decisional conflict for GT or satisfaction. Cancer genetics knowledge improved in both groups without significant difference (+0.9 VBGE, +1.8 GC, P = .056). Men who chose VBGE had higher intention to share GT results (96.4% VBGE v 86.4% GC, P = .02). Both groups had high rates of GT uptake (VBGE 94.4%, GC 92%).

The present study investigated the effects of aberrantly expressed DVL2 on PDAC. A total of 97 pancreatic cancer (PC) samples and 85 adjacent normal samples were obtained from patients who were histopathologically diagnosed with primary PDAC. The present study demonstrated that DVL2 expression was upregulated in PDAC tissues and was positively associated with advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis in patients with PDAC. In addition, patients with high expression of DVL2 had a shorter overall survival rate compared with those with low expression. To elucidate the role of DVL2 in PDAC, lentivirus-mediated short hairpin RNA was used to silence DVL2 and its physiological function was analyzed in CFPAC-1 and PANC-1 cells. The results indicated that DVL2 downregulation significantly impaired its oncogenic functions including cell proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, DVL2 knockdown inhibits the proliferation and invasion of PC cells in vivo. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that DVL2 interacted with β-catenin; knockdown of DVL2 reduced the expression level of β-catenin and inhibited β-catenin translocation into the nucleus.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 136 patients with recurrent urinary retention who underwent water vapor therapy in an ambulatory setting with periprostatic block and optional sedation between 11/2017 and 02/2021 in three urological departments. The objective was successful catheter withdrawal and continuing catheter independency after 3- and 12-months following treatment.  Results:   Mean patient age was 80.3 years (±7.8), mean prostate volume 54 ml (±27.3), and mean catheter dependency before treatment was 4.8 months (±6.0). ASA classification was a followed: II: 10%, III: 71%, and IV: 19%. All procedures were performed successfully in an ambulatory setting. Perioperative complications were infrequent and minor (Clavien-Dindo Grade 1-2) and included haematuria in 4.4% and urinary tract infection in 3.9% of all cases. A total of 103 patients (78.6%) were able to void spontaneously after a median of 31 days. No significant differences in age, prostate volume, duration of catheter dependency, vapor injections, and ASA score were found between patients with successful or unsuccessful outcome.

Macrophages are key cells which infiltrate and surround tumor cells and are recognized to significantly contribute to tumor resistance and metastases. Our understanding of their function in the TME is commonly based on in vitro and in vivo models, with limited research to confirm these model observations in human prostates. Macrophage infiltration was evaluated within the TME of human prostates after 72 h culture of fresh biopsies samples in the presence of control or enzalutamide. In addition to immunohistochemistry, an optimized protocol for multi-parametric evaluation of cellular surface markers was developed using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry parameters were compared to clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemistry staining for 19 patients with paired samples suggested enzalutamide increased the expression of CD163 relative to CD68 staining. Techniques to validate these results using flow cytometry of dissociated biopsies after 72 h of culture are described. In a second cohort of patients with Gleason grade group ≥ 3 prostate cancer, global macrophage expression of CD163 was unchanged with enzalutamide treatment. However, exploratory analyses of our results using multi-parametric flow cytometry for multiple immunosuppressive macrophage markers suggest subgroup changes as well as novel associations between circulating biomarkers like the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and immune cell phenotype composition in the prostate TME. Further, we observed an association between B7-H3 expressing tumor-associated macrophages and the presence of intraductal carcinoma. The use of flow cytometry to evaluate ex vivo cultured prostate biopsies fills an important gap in our ability to understand the immune cell composition of the prostate TME.

SPOP mutation induces stabilization of GLP and its partner protein G9a and aberrant upregulation of global DNA hypermethylation in cultured PCa cells and primary PCa specimens. Genome-wide DNA methylome analysis shows that a subset of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) including FOXO3, GATA5, and NDRG1, are hypermethylated and downregulated in SPOP-mutated PCa cells. DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine effectively reverses expression of the TSGs examined, inhibits SPOP-mutated PCa cell growth in vitro and in mice, and enhances docetaxel anti-cancer efficacy. Our findings reveal the GLP/G9a-DNMT module as a mediator of DNA hypermethylation in SPOP-mutated PCa.

Biochemical relapse was defined as PSA nadir +2ng/mL.  Results:   The median follow-up time after SBRT was 24.1 months. No grade ≥3 toxicities were observed. The incidence of acute and late grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicities was both 0.99%. Acute and late grade 2 genitourinary (GU) toxicities were observed in 5.9% and 9.9%, respectively.

However, the expression and exact roles of LAMTOR5-AS1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain unclear. Thus, we measured LAMTOR5-AS1 expression in NSCLC and gauged its clinical value. The detailed roles and downstream working mechanism of LAMTOR5-AS1 in NSCLC were comprehensively unraveled. qRT-PCR was applied to measure gene expression. Functionally, utilizing small interfering RNA, LAMTOR5-AS1 was ablated, and the functional alterations were addressed by means of different experiments. The targeting activities between LAMTOR5-AS1 and microRNA-506-3p (miR-506-3p) and between miR-506-3p and E2F transcription factor 6 (E2F6) were confirmed by RNA immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assays. LAMTOR5-AS1 overexpression in NSCLC was verified in TCGA datasets and our own cohort and manifested an evident relationship with poor prognosis. Interference with LAMTOR5-AS1 led to repression of the proliferation, cloning, and metastasis abilities of NSCLC cells in vitro. We further confirmed an obvious increase in LAMTOR5-AS1-silenced NSCLC cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the absence of LAMTOR5-AS1 restricted tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LAMTOR5-AS1 sponged miR-506-3p in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, E2F6, a downstream target of miR-506-3p, was under the control of LAMTOR5-AS1, which was realized by decoying miR-506-3p. Rescue experiments showed that miR-506-3p suppression or E2F6 reintroduction was capable of remitting LAMTOR5-AS1 deficiency-triggered anticarcinogenic actions in NSCLC. Our study confirmed the exact roles of LAMTOR5-AS1 for the first time and revealed that LAMTOR5-AS1 knockdown disrupts the malignancy of NSCLC by targeting the miR-506-3p/E2F6 axis. Targeting the LAMTOR5-AS1/miR-506-3p/E2F6 pathway may be instrumental for managing patients with NSCLC.""","""['Guojie Chen', 'Kai Wang', 'Guoshu Li', 'Leidong Wang', 'Yangyang Xiao', 'Bo Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncol Res""","""['Long noncoding RNA VPS9D1-AS1 augments the malignant phenotype of non-small cell lung cancer by sponging microRNA-532-3p and thereby enhancing HMGA2 expression.', 'LncRNA NNT-AS1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer progression through regulating miR-22-3p/YAP1 axis.', 'E2F1-Induced Overexpression of Long Noncoding RNA SBF2-AS1 Promotes Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Metastasis Through Regulating miR-362-3p/GRB2 Axis.', 'A review on the role of NCK1 Antisense RNA 1 (NCK1-AS1) in diverse disorders.', 'DNA and histone modifications as potent diagnostic and therapeutic targets to advance non-small cell lung cancer management from the perspective of 3P medicine.']"""

Methods:   RNA-seq, qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry were employed to identify and confirm the high expression of indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) in CRPC and the clinical relevance. Chip assay was used to identify Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase (SMYD3) as a major epigenetic regulator of INMT. LC-MS/MS were used to identify new substrates of INMT methylation in CRPC tissues. Gene knockdown/overexpression, MTT and mouse cancer models were used to examine the role of INMT as well as the anticancer efficacy of INMT inhibitor N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the SMYD3 inhibitor BCl-12, the selenium compounds methaneseleninic acid (MSA) and Se-(Methyl)selenocysteine hydrochloride (MSC), and the newly identified endogenous INMT substrate Bis(7)-tacrine.  Results:   We found that the expression of INMT was highly increased in CRPC and was correlated with poor prognosis of clinical prostate cancer (PCa). INMT promoted PCa castration resistance via detoxification of anticancer metabolites. Knockdown of INMT or treatment with INMT inhibitor N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) significantly suppressed CRPC development. Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase SMYD3 was a major epigenetic regulator of INMT expression, treatment with SMYD3 inhibitor BCl-121 suppressed INMT expression and inhibits CRPC development. Importantly, INMT knockdown significantly increased the anticancer effect of the exogenous selenium compounds methaneseleninic acid (MSA) and Se-(Methyl)selenocysteine hydrochloride (MSC) as well as the endogenous metabolite Bis(7)-tacrine.

In this study, we determined the functional effects and regulation of COMT in prostate cancer. Both the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens demonstrated a reduction of COMT expression in prostate cancer. Also, western analyses of prostate cancer cell lines show COMT levels to be minimal in DuPro and DU145 and thus, these cells were used for further analyses. Re-expression of COMT led to suppressed migration ability (wound healing assay) and enhanced apoptosis (flow cytometric analyses), and when challenged with 4-hydroxyestradiol, a marked reduction of cell proliferation (MTT assay) was observed. Xenograft growth in athymic mice also resulted in inhibition due to COMT. As a mechanism, western analyses show cleaved CASP3 and BID were increased whereas XIAP and cIAP2 were reduced due to COMT. As COMT expression is low in prostate cancer, its regulation was determined. Databases identified several miRNAs capable of binding COMT and of these, miR-195 was observed to be increased in prostate cancer according to TCGA. Real-time PCR validated upregulation of miR-195 in clinical prostate cancer specimens as well as DuPro and DU145 and interestingly, luciferase reporter showed miR-195 capable of binding COMT and overexpressing miR-195 could reduce COMT in cells.

Methods:   A population-based prospective study was conducted using data linkage between the national HIV and cancer registries. Invasive cancers identified in PLHIV were grouped into AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs), infection-related non-ADCs (NADCs), and non-infection-related NADCs. Crude and age-standardized incidence rates of cancers were calculated and compared over five time periods: 1982-1995, 1996-1999, 2000-2004, 2005-2008 and 2009-2012, roughly reflecting advances in HIV antiretroviral therapy. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) compared with the Australian general population were calculated for each time period. Generalized linear models were developed to assess time trends in crude and age-standardized incidences.  Results:   For ADCs, the crude and age-standardized incidences of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma substantially declined over time (P-trend < 0.001 for all) but SIRs remained significantly elevated. For infection-related NADCs, there were significant increases in the crude incidences of anal, liver and head and neck cancers. Age-standardized incidences increased for anal cancer (P-trend = 0.002) and liver cancer (P-trend < 0.001). SIRs were significantly elevated for anal cancer, liver cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. For non-infection-related NADCs, the crude incidence of colorectal, lung and prostate cancers increased over time, but age-standardized incidences remained stable.

However, the depth and wavelength dependent optical attenuation and the unknown optical and acoustic heterogeneities limit the USPA imaging performance in deep tissue regions. Novel instrumentation, image reconstruction, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are currently being investigated to overcome these limitations and improve the USPA image quality. Effective implementation of these approaches requires a reliable USPA simulation tool capable of generating US based anatomical and PA based molecular contrasts of deep biological tissue. Here, we developed a hybrid USPA simulation platform by integrating finite element models of light (NIRFast) and ultrasound (k-Wave) propagations for co-simulation of B-mode US and PA images. The platform allows optimization of different design parameters for USPA devices, such as the aperture size and frequency of both light and ultrasound detector arrays. For designing tissue-realistic digital phantoms, a dictionary-based function has been added to k-Wave to generate various levels of ultrasound speckle contrast. The feasibility of modeling US imaging combined with optical fluence dependent multispectral PA imaging is demonstrated using homogeneous as well as heterogeneous tissue phantoms mimicking human organs (e.g., prostate and finger). In addition, we also demonstrate the potential of the simulation platform to generate large scale application-specific training and test datasets for AI enhanced USPA imaging. The complete USPA simulation codes together with the supplementary user guides have been posted to an open-source repository (https://github.com/KothapalliLabPSU/US-PA_simulation_codes).""","""['Sumit Agrawal', 'Thaarakh Suresh', 'Ankit Garikipati', 'Ajay Dangi', 'Sri-Rajasekhar Kothapalli']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Photoacoustics""","""['Modeling toolchain for realistic simulation of photoacoustic data acquisition.', 'Sparsity-based photoacoustic image reconstruction with a linear array transducer and direct measurement of the forward model.', '3D Monte Carlo simulation of light distribution in mouse brain in quantitative photoacoustic computed tomography.', 'Multidomain computational modeling of photoacoustic imaging: verification, validation, and image quality prediction.', 'What scans we will read: imaging instrumentation trends in clinical oncology.', 'Evaluation of Cholesterol Thickness of Blood Vessels Using Photoacoustic Technology.', 'Photoacoustic imaging with limited sampling: a review of machine learning approaches.', 'A Comprehensive Review on Photoacoustic-Based Devices for Biomedical Applications.', 'Clinical photoacoustic/ultrasound dual-modal imaging: Current status and future trends.', 'Biomedical Application of Photoacoustics: A Plethora of Opportunities.']"""

Our previous study indicated that TMEPAI (transmembrane prostate androgen-induced protein) attenuated doxorubicin sensitivity in triple-negative breast cancer cells. However, how TMEPAI contributes to doxorubicin resistance in TNBC remains unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of TMEPAI in doxorubicin resistance in triple-negative breast cancer cells.  Methods:   We used BT549, triple-negative cells wild type (WT), and BT549 TMEPAI knock-out. Both cells were treated with TGF-β 2 ng/mL for 24 hours, followed by TGF-β 2 ng/mL and doxorubicin 12.9 nM for another 24 hours. Afterward, the cells were harvested and counted. Cells were further lysed and used for RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. We determined the expression levels of proliferation, apoptosis, EMT markers, and drug efflux transporters. Additionally, we investigated the expressions of PI3K as well as SMAD3 and AKT phosphorylation.  Results:   TNBC cells were shown to be less sensitive to doxorubicin in the presence of TMEPAI. TMEPAI was shown to alleviate the mRNA expressions of apoptosis markers: Bax, Bcl2, Caspase-3, and Caspase-9. Our results indicated that the presence of TMEPAI greatly amplifies EMT and increases drug efflux transporter expressions after doxorubicin treatment. Furthermore, our findings demonstrated that TMEPAI reduced the action of doxorubicin in inhibiting SMAD3 phosphorylation. TMEPAI was also shown to modify the effect of doxorubicin by reducing PI3K expressions and Akt phosphorylation in triple-negative breast cancer cells.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that TMEPAI promotes EMT and drug efflux transporters at least in part by shifting doxorubicin action from SMAD3 phosphorylation reduction to PI3K/AKT inhibition in triple-negative breast cancer cells.""","""['Bantari W K Wardhani', 'Melva Louisa', 'Yukihide Watanabe', 'Rianto Setiabudy', 'Mitsuyasu Kato']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press)""","""['TGF-β-Induced TMEPAI Attenuates the Response of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells to Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel.', 'Increased Smad3 and reduced Smad2 levels mediate the functional switch of TGF-β from growth suppressor to growth and metastasis promoter through TMEPAI/PMEPA1 in triple negative breast cancer.', 'TGF-β induced TMEPAI/PMEPA1 inhibits canonical Smad signaling through R-Smad sequestration and promotes non-canonical PI3K/Akt signaling by reducing PTEN in triple negative breast cancer.', 'Curcumin suppresses doxorubicin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the inhibition of TGF-β and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in triple-negative breast cancer cells.', 'Novel RAS inhibitor 25-O-methylalisol F attenuates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and tubulo-interstitial fibrosis by selectively inhibiting TGF-β-mediated Smad3 phosphorylation.', 'Revisiting Epithelial Carcinogenesis.']"""

Aptamers are short single-stranded oligonucleotides evolved from systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). It has been proved that aptamers can interact with cognate target molecules with high affinity and specificity and have great potential in the development of medical imaging at molecular level.  Purpose:   To select epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) specific aptamers targeting prostate cancer and further to conjugate aptamers with GoldMag nanoparticles (a typical iron oxide core/gold shell structure) to construct magnetic molecular probes for medical imaging.  Methods:   EpCAM-specific aptamers were selected by Cell-SELEX. The enrichment of specific aptamer candidates was monitored by flow cytometric analysis. Aptamers were further conjugated with GoldMag nanoparticles to construct magnetic molecular probes. The affinity and specificity of aptamer candidates and aptamer-conjugated GoldMag nanoparticles were evaluated. The MR imaging of aptamer-conjugated GoldMag nanoparticles to prostate cancer was further explored in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   After 12 rounds of selection, aptamer candidates Eppc6 and Eppc14 could specifically target three types of prostate cancer cells, revealing a high affinity of Eppc6 and Eppc14. Moreover, aptamer-conjugated GoldMag nanoparticles not only exhibited good affinity to different prostate cancer cells but also produced strong T2WI signal intensity reduction distinguished from peritumoral tissue in MRI, indicating that the molecular probes possess both the affinity properties of EpCAM-specific aptamer and the superparamagnetic features of iron oxide.  Conclusion:   Our study indicates that aptamer Eppc6 and Eppc14 can recognize prostate cancer cells and tissues.

The underlying mechanisms that account for the ultimate emergence of resistance to ADT, progressing to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), include those that reactivate androgen receptor (AR), or those that are entirely independent or cooperate with androgen signaling to underlie PCa progression. The intricacy of metabolic pathways associated with PCa progression spurred us to develop a metabolism-centric analysis to assess the metabolic shift occurring in PCa that progresses with low AR expression. We used PCa patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to assess the metabolic changes after castration of tumor-bearing mice and subsequently confirmed main findings in human donor tumor that progressed after ADT. We found that relapsed tumors had a significant increase in fatty acids and ketone body (KB) content compared with baseline. We confirmed that critical ketolytic enzymes (ACAT1, OXCT1, BDH1) were dysregulated after castrate-resistant progression. Further, these enzymes are increased in the human donor tissue after progressing to ADT. In an in silico approach, increased ACAT1, OXCT1, BDH1 expression was also observed for a subset of PCa patients that relapsed with low AR and ERG (ETS-related gene) expression.

Materials and methods:   MRI for twenty patients was performed on a Philips Ingenia 3T scanner without an endorectal coil followed by subsequent radical prostatectomy. DCE 3D T1-FFE data were acquired with injection of 0.03 mmol/kg followed after 2 minutes by 0.07 mmol/kg of DOTAREM. Regions-of-interest on histologically verified PCa and normal tissue in different prostate zones and the iliac artery were drawn. Average signal intensity as function of time was calculated for each ROI and fitted by using the signal intensity form of the Tofts (SI-Tofts) model to extract physiological parameters (Ktrans and ve). In addition, the scaled arterial input function (AIF) obtained from 30PSD data was used to analyze 70PSD data.  Results:   The AIF obtained from 30PSD data showed both first and second passes clearly and had much higher peak magnitude than AIFs from 70PSD data. Ktrans was significantly (p < 0.05) larger in PCa than in normal tissue in peripheral zone (PZ) and central zone (CZ) for both 70PSD and 70PSD data analyzed with a scaled AIF. Ktrans in cancer overlapped with that of normal tissue in the transition zone (TZ). There was no statistical difference in ve between cancer and normal tissue. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that use of the AIF from 30PSD data to analyze 70PSD data increased the diagnostic efficacy of Ktrans in the PZ and CZ.

Consisting of two modules, a global feature extraction module and a point transformation module, FPT does not assume explicit constraints based on point vicinity, thereby overcoming a common requirement of previous learning-based point-set registration methods. FPT is designed to accept unordered and unstructured point-sets with a variable number of points and uses a ""model-free"" approach without heuristic constraints. Training FPT is flexible and involves minimizing an intuitive unsupervised loss function, but supervised, semi-supervised, and partially- or weakly-supervised training are also supported. This flexibility makes FPT amenable to multimodal image registration problems where the ground-truth deformations are difficult or impossible to measure. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of FPT to non-rigid registration of prostate magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and sparsely-sampled transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images. The registration errors were 4.71 mm and 4.81 mm for complete TRUS imaging and sparsely-sampled TRUS imaging, respectively. The results indicate superior accuracy to the alternative rigid and non-rigid registration algorithms tested and substantially lower computation time.

Based on CELSR3 differentially coexpressed genes (DCEGs), enrichment analysis was performed to investigate potential mechanisms of CELSR3 in MPCa. Results: The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) for CELSR3 was 0.80, demonstrating that CELSR3 expression was higher in MPCa than in localized prostate cancer (LPCa). CELSR3 showed moderate potential to distinguish MPCa from LPCa. CELSR3 protein expression was found to be markedly upregulated in MPCa than in LPCa tissues. The authors screened 894 CELSR3 DCEGs, which were notably enriched in the focal adhesion pathway. miRNA-221-3p showed a significantly negative correlation with CELSR3 in MPCa. Besides, miRNA-221-3p expression was downregulated in MPCa than in LPCa (SMD = -1.04), and miRNA-221-3p was moderately capable of distinguishing MPCa from LPCa.

The results of phylogenetic tree revealed that four isolated HBV DNA in cancer patients were cluster with genotype D.  Conclusions:   High frequency of 6.66% HBV infection have been observed in cancer patients before chemotherapy. The sera of 9.52% patients were only positive for anti-HBc IgG which may indicate the past HBV infection or presence of OBI but requires further investigation.

This study assessed the risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) to identify the most common SMNs to be considered in follow-up care.  Methods:   Population-based cancer registries retrospectively identified first primary tumors (between 1976 and 2013) and SMNs in AYAs (15-39 years old at their cancer diagnosis). AYA cancer survivors were those alive at least 5 years after their first cancer diagnosis. The excess risk of SMNs was measured as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risk together with the cumulative incidence of SMNs.  Results:   The cohort included 67,692 AYA cancer survivors. The excess risk of developing any SMN (SIR, 1.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-1.7) was 60%. The excess risk of SMNs was significantly high for survivors of lymphomas; cancers of the breast, thyroid, female genital tract, digestive organs, gonads, and urinary tract; and melanomas. The cumulative incidence of all SMNs in AYA cancer survivors within 25 years of their first cancer diagnosis was approximately 10%. Subsequent tumors contributing to approximately 60% of all SMNs were breast cancer, colorectal cancer, corpus uteri cancer, and ovarian cancer in females and colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and lymphomas in males.

Commonly available PC cell lines do not accurately reflect the complexity of this disease and there is critical need for development of new models to recapitulate the intricate hierarchy of tumor pathogenesis. In current study, we established ex vivo primary patient-derived cancer organoid (PDCO) cultures from prostatectomy specimens of patients with locally advanced PC. We then performed a comprehensive multi-parameter characterization of the cellular composition utilizing a novel approach for live-cell staining and direct imaging in the integrated microfluidic Stacks device. Using orthogonal flow cytometry analysis, we demonstrate that primary PDCOs maintain distinct subsets of epithelial cells throughout culture and that these cells conserve expression of androgen receptor (AR)-related elements. Furthermore, to confirm the tumor-origin of the PDCOs we have analyzed the expression of PC-associated epigenetic biomarkers including promoter methylation of the GSTP1, RASSF1 and APC and RARb genes by employing a novel microfluidic rare-event screening protocol. These results demonstrate that this ex vivo PDCO model recapitulates the complexity of the epithelial tumor microenvironment of multifocal PC using orthogonal analyses.

We aimed to explore the potential protective effect of a second rectal enema before biopsy.  Methods:   From January 2015 to December 2020, 419 patients were assessed retrospectively. Patients with a history of anticoagulant use, uncontrolled diabetes, urological surgery, prostate biopsy or recent hospitalisation or overseas travel, as well as those with the previous prostatitis, were excluded from the study. The patients were subsequently divided into two groups: Group 1 (n = 223) had received one enema, on the morning of the biopsy and Group 2 (n = 196) had received two, with the additional enema administered half an hour before the procedure.  Results:   There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of age(P = .076), BMI (P = .489), diabetes (P = .265), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (P = .193), free/total PSA (f/t PSA) ratio (P = .518) and prostate size (P = .661) or in relation to cancer detection (P = .428). The median hospitalisation date was significantly higher in Group 1 (P = .003) as was urinary tract infection (UTI) development (P = .004). However, there was no significant difference in terms of fever and sepsis (P = .524 and P = .548, respectively). Additionally, subgroup analysis demonstrated that UTI was significantly lower in patients with diabetes mellitus who had received a second enema (P = .004), though there was no significant difference in UTI between the groups in those without diabetes mellitus (P = .215). Multivariable analysis showed that age and diabetes were significant risk factors for the development of UTI (OR: 1.074, 95% CI: 1.027-1.130, P = .002 and OR: 1.220, 95% CI: 0.131-0.665, P = .003, respectively). Furthermore, the second enema was a significant protective factor for preventing UTI (OR: -1.794, 95% CI: 2.208-16.389, P < .001).  Conclusion:   Older age and the presence of diabetes mellitus are independent risk factors for UTI after prostate biopsy.

Materials and methods:   Endogenous testosterone density (ETD, ratio between ET and prostate volume [PV]), biopsy positive cores density (BPCD, the ratio between the number of positive cores and PV) and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD, ratio between total PSA and PV) were retrospectively evaluated on a prospectively collected data on 430 patients with IR PCa submitted to radical prostatectomy (RP). Tumor load (TL) was measured as the percentage of prostatic volume occupied by cancer at final pathology. Unfavorable disease (UD) was defined as tumor upgrading (ISUP grading group 4, 5) and/or upstaging (pT3a or 3b) in prostate specimens. Associations were assessed by the logistic regression and linear regression models.  Results:   Overall, UD, which was detected in 122 out of 430 IR patients (28.4%), was predicted by BPCD (odd ratio, OR = 1.356; 95% CI 1.048-1.754; p = 0.020) with a sensitivity 98.4% and overall accuracy 71.9%.

Methods:   Patients with newly diagnosed breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer were invited to participate in a 6-month exercise intervention. Background data for all respondents (n = 2051) were collected at baseline by questionnaire and medical records. Additional data were collected using an extended questionnaire, physical activity monitors, and fitness testing for trial participants (n = 577). Moreover, a sub-group of decliners (n = 436) consented to additional data collection by an extended questionnaire . Data were analyzed for between-group differences using independent t-tests and chi2-tests.  Results:   Trial participants were younger (59 ± 12yrs vs. 64 ± 11yrs, p < .001), more likely to be women (80% vs. 75%, p = .012), and scheduled for chemotherapy treatment (54% vs. 34%, p < .001), compared to decliners (n = 1391). A greater proportion had university education (60% vs 40%, p < .001), reported higher anxiety and fatigue, higher exercise self-efficacy and outcome expectations, and less kinesiophobia at baseline compared to decliners. A greater proportion of trial participants were classified as 'not physically active' at baseline; however, within the group who participated, being ""physically active"" at baseline was associated with trial completion. Completers (n = 410) also reported less kinesiophobia than drop-outs (n = 167).  Conclusion:   The recruitment procedures used in comprehensive oncology exercise trials should specifically address barriers for participation among men, patients without university education and older patients.

Nevertheless, current 68Ga-labeled radiotracers show only fair detection rates for metastatic prostate cancer lesions, especially those with lower levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), which often occurs in the biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The goal of this study was to design and synthesize a new PSMA-targeted radiotracer, 68Ga-SC691, with high affinity for prostate cancer cells and excellent pharmacokinetics. To this end, structural optimization was carried out on the bifunctional group, target motif, and linker while the high affinity targeting scaffold remained. To explore its potential in the clinic, a comparative study was further performed in vitro and in vivo between 68Ga-SC691 and 68Ga-PSMA-11, a clinically approved tracer for PSMA-positive prostate cancer. SC691 was radiolabeled to provide 68Ga-SC691 in 99% radiolabeling yield under mild conditions. High uptake and a high internalization ratio into LNCaP cells were observed in in vitro studies. In vivo studies showed that 68Ga-SC691 had favorable biodistribution properties and could specifically accumulate on PSMA-positive LNCaP xenografts visualized by micro-PET/CT.

Analyses were performed on a subsample of decedents with follow-back time of more than 1 year (2013-2017, N=52 496).  Interventions:   N/A.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Proportion of patients receiving PACT during the last year and month of life. We calculated CIs with block bootstrapping, while predictors of PACT were estimated with logistic regression.  Results:   24.0% (95% CI 23.4% to 24.6%) of the patients received PACT during the last year of life and 3.2% (95% CI 3.0% to 3.5%) during their final month. The proportion during the last month was highest for multiple myeloma (12.7%) and breast cancer (6.5%) and lowest for urinary tract (1.1%) and prostate and kidney cancer (1.4%). Patients living in northern (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94) and western (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.96) Norway had lower odds of PACT during the last month, while patients with myeloma (OR 3.0, 95% CI 2.5 to 3.7) and breast (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) had higher odds. Kidney cancer (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.2. to 0.4), urinary tract (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.5) and prostate cancer (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.5) were associated with lower probability of receiving PACT within the last month.  Conclusions:   The proportion of patients receiving PACT in Norway is lower than in several other industrialised countries. Age, type of cancer and area of living are significant determinants of variation in PACT.""","""['Christoffer Bugge', 'Stein Kaasa', 'Erik Magnus Sæther', 'Hans Olav Melberg', 'Ivar Sonbo Kristiansen']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Care pathways at end-of-life for cancer decedents: registry based analyses of the living situation, healthcare utilization and costs for all cancer decedents in Norway in 2009-2013 during their last 6 months of life.', 'Comparison of Site of Death, Health Care Utilization, and Hospital Expenditures for Patients Dying With Cancer in 7 Developed Countries.', 'End-of-life care in cancer patients: how much drug therapy and how much palliative care?

Objective:   To assess the safety of using a 2-yr interval in men who were previously screened positive with PSA but had negative MRI or positive MRI with a negative biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 61 201 men aged 50-60 yr were randomized and 38 366 were invited for screening (years 2015-2020). Men with positive MRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] score ≥3) were scheduled for targeted biopsies. Men with negative MRI or negative biopsies were reinvited after 2 yr. Round 1 and 2 MRI scans (PI-RADS ≥3) of men not diagnosed with PC in round 1 were re-read and classified according to Prostate Cancer Radiological Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) by two radiologists. Interval PCs (detected outside the program before invitation to round 2) were identified by linking to the Regional PC Registry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Tabulation of overall detection of PC was done.  Results and limitations:   Between October 2017 and June 2020, 474 men with round 1 elevated PSA and MRI underwent a second screening. Of those, 19% had nonelevated PSA in round 2 and were not examined further. Of the remaining 376 men, 89% had negative MRI. Targeted biopsies yielded 14 PCs: nine grade group (GG) 1 and five GG 2-3. In men with PI-RADS ≥3 and PC diagnosed in round 2, only two (GG 1) progressed according to the PRECISE criteria and the remainder were stable. Ten interval PCs were diagnosed: seven GG 1, one GG 2, and two GG 5. The two GG 5 PCs were PI-RADS 4 and 5 with negative round 1 biopsy.  Conclusions:   A 2-yr interval seems to be safe in men with negative MRI, while men with PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions with negative biopsies should have a closer follow-up.

Methods:   Ninety patients with PCa and 112 patients with BPH were included in this retrospective study. Differences in whole-lesion histograms and texture parameters of ADC maps and T2W images between PCa and BPH patients were evaluated using the independent samples t-test. The diagnostic performance of ADC maps and T2W images in being able to differentiate PCa from BPH was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS : The mean, median, 5th, and 95th percentiles of ADC values in images from PCa patients were significantly lower than those from BPH patients (p < 0.05). Significant differences were observed in the means, standard deviations, medians, kurtosis, skewness, and 5th percentile values of T2W image between PCa and BPH patients (p < 0.05). The ADC5th showed the largest AUC (0.906) with a sensitivity of 83.3 % and specificity of 89.3 %.

The current vaccination effort may reduce the infection rate, but strain variants are emerging under selection pressure. Thus, there is an urgent need to find drugs that treat COVID-19 and save human lives. Hence, in this study, we identified phytoconstituents of an edible vegetable, Bitter melon (Momordica charantia), that affect the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  Methods:   Components of Momordica charantia were tested to identify the compounds that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. An MTiOpenScreen web-server was used to perform docking studies. The Lipinski rule was utilized to evaluate potential interactions between the drug and other target molecules. PyMol and Schrodinger software were used to identify the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was employed to assess the interaction between an extract component (erythrodiol) and the spike protein.  Results:   Our in-silico evaluations showed that phytoconstituents of Momordica charantia have a low binding energy range, -5.82 to -5.97 kcal/mol. A docking study revealed two sets of phytoconstituents that bind at the S1 and S2 domains of SARS-CoV-2. SPR showed that erythrodiol has a strong binding affinity (KD = 1.15 μM) with the S2 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, docking, ADME properties, and SPR displayed strong interactions between phytoconstituents and the active site of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  Conclusion:   This study reveals that phytoconstituents from bitter melon are potential agents to treat SARS-CoV-2 viral infections due to their binding to spike proteins S1 and S2.""","""['Santosh Kumar Singh', 'Shailesh Singh', 'Rajesh Singh']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Ovarian Res""","""['Molecular Docking of Phytochemical Compounds of Momordica charantia as Potential Inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.', 'Multidisciplinary Approaches Identify Compounds that Bind to Human ACE2 or SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein as Candidates to Block SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 Receptor Interactions.', 'Phytoconstituents from Moringa oleifera fruits target ACE2 and open spike glycoprotein to combat SARS-CoV-2: An integrative phytochemical and computational approach.', 'Computational Lock and Key and Dynamic Trajectory Analysis of Natural Biophors Against COVID-19 Spike Protein to Identify Effective Lead Molecules.', 'Promise of bitter melon (Momordica charantia) bioactives in cancer prevention and therapy.', 'Application of the Nicoya OpenSPR to Studies of Biomolecular Binding: A Review of the Literature from 2016 to 2022.', 'Recent Advances of Representative Optical Biosensors for Rapid and Sensitive Diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.', 'Cytokines and Chemokines in Cancer Cachexia and Its Long-Term Impact on COVID-19.']"""

Different EV isolation methods differ in terms of complexity and yield, conditioning, as consequence, the analytical result.  Methods:   The aim of this study was to compare three different isolation methods for urine EVs: ultracentrifugation (UC), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and a commercial kit (Exolute® Urine Kit). Urine samples were collected from 6 PCa patients and 4 healthy donors. After filtered through 0.22 µm filters, urine was divided in 3 equal volumes to perform EVs isolation with each of the three approaches. Isolated EVs were characterized by spectrophotometric protein quantification, nanoparticle tracking analysis, transmission electron microscopy, AlphaScreen Technology, and whole miRNA Transcriptome.  Results:   Our results showed that UC and SEC provided better results in terms of EVs yield and purity than Exolute®, non-significant differences were observed in terms of EV-size. Interestingly, luminescent AlphaScreen assay demonstrated a significant enrichment of CD9 and CD63 positive microvesicles in SEC and UC methods compared with Exolute®.

Viral inactivation assay showed that the natural extracts in a herb-derived phytoconstituent-based formulation, BITS-003, comprising Bacopa monnieri, Glycyerrhiza glabra, Asparagus racemosus-wild, and Nigella sativa had strong virucidal properties, inactivating enveloped viruses from 2log10 (or 99%) to >4log10 (or 99.99%). Moreover, bacterial and yeast cells treated with BITS-003 displayed reduced growth. Topical use of the formulation as a mouthwash/gargle could be effective in reducing symptoms of respiratory viral infections, with the potential to decrease the viral load in the buccal/oral cavity.

A subsequent 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT demonstrated a high FDG-avidity by mediastinal lymphadenopathies as opposed to the low prostate cancer FDG uptake. Of note, both tumor entities were clearly detected by the two scans. However, different ranges in terms of Maximum Standardized Uptake Value (SUVmax) uptake allowed the discrimination between the two tumor entities.

Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of doxycycline on NLRP3 regulation in cancer using an in vitro model. NLRP3 was activated in a prostate cancer cell line (PC3) and a lung cancer cell line (A549) before treatment with doxycycline. Inflammasome activation was assessed by analyzing RNA expression of NLRP3, Pro-CASP-1, and Pro-IL1β using RT-qPCR. Additionally, NLPR3 protein expression and IL-1β secretion were analyzed using Western blot and ELISA, respectively. Tumor cell viability was determined using Annexin V staining and a cell proliferation assay. Cytokine secretion was analyzed using a 41Plex assay for human cytokines. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA model with Tukey's post hoc tests. Doxycycline treatment decreased NLRP3 formation in PC3 and A549 cells compared to untreated and LPS only treated cells (p < 0.05). Doxycycline also decreased proliferation and caused cell death through apoptosis, a response that differed to the LPS-Nigericin mediated pyroptosis.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying STEAP1 and its structural determinants remain elusive.  Methods:   The fraction capacity of Butyl- and Octyl-Sepharose matrices on LNCaP lysates was evaluated by manipulating the ionic strength of binding and elution phases, followed by a Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) polishing. Several potential stabilizing additives were assessed, and the melting temperature (Tm) values ranked the best/worst compounds. The secondary structure of STEAP1 was identified by circular dichroism.  Results:   The STEAP1 was not fully captured with 1.375 M (Butyl), in contrast with interfering heterologous proteins, which were strongly retained and mostly eluted with water. This single step demonstrated higher selectivity of Butyl-Sepharose for host impurities removal from injected crude samples. Co-IP allowed recovering a purified fraction of STEAP1 and contributed to unveil potential physiologically interacting counterparts with the target. A Tm of ~55 °C was determined, confirming STEAP1 stability in the purification buffer. A predominant α-helical structure was identified, ensuring the protein's structural stability.

Key regulatory genes involved in proliferation activity, in the regulation of stress, and in the regulation of inflammation processes of the tumor microenvironment were selected to test a priori multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) models and create a combined score to better predict the patients' survival and disease-free intervals. Survival was positively correlated with cortisol expression and negatively with Mini-Chromosome Maintenance 7 (MCM7) and Breast-Related Cancer Antigen2 (BRCA2) expression. The disease-free interval was negatively related to the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), MCM7, BRCA2, and programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1). MDS suggested two separate pathways of activation in PC. Within these two dimensions three separate clusters emerged: (1) cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF, (2) PD-L1 and cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTL4); (3) and finally EZH2, MCM7, BRCA2, and c-Myc. We entered the three clusters of association shown in the MDS in several Kaplan-Meier analyses. It was found that only Cluster 3 was significantly related to the interval-disease free, indicating that patients with an overall higher activity of regulatory genes of proliferation and DNA repair had a lower probability to have a longer disease-free time.

The changes in key signaling pathways involved in carcinogenesis were assessed by using a phosphorylation pathway profiling array and by Western blotting. Antiproliferative effects of HT and two lipophilic derivatives [hydroxytyrosyl acetate (HT-Ac)/ethyl hydroxytyrosyl ether (HT-Et)] were significantly higher in cancerous PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells than in non-malignant RWPE-1 cells. HT/HT-Ac/HT-Et significantly reduced migration capacity in RWPE-1 and PC-3 and prostatosphere size and colony formation in 22Rv1, whereas only HT-Ac and HT-Et reduced these functional parameters in PC-3. The cytotoxic effect in 22Rv1 cells was correlated with modifications in the phosphorylation pattern of key proteins, including ERK1/2 and AKT.

We utilized multiple RNA-seq and cDNA microarray datasets to analyze gene expression profiles and performed logistics aggression and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis after stratifying patients based on tumor stages and Gleason scores. We also used NCBI GEO datasets to examine gene expression patterns in individual cell types of the prostate gland and to determine the androgen-induced alteration of gene expression. Spearman coefficient analysis was conducted to access the correlation of target gene expression with treatment responses and disease progression status. The classic PGR was mainly expressed in stromal cells and progestin and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) genes were the predominant genes in prostate epithelial cells. Progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1) was significantly higher than PGRMC2 in all prostate cell types. In prostate cancer tissues, PAQR6 expression was significantly upregulated, while all other genes were largely downregulated compared to normal prostate tissues. Although both PAQR6 upregulation and PAQR5 downregulation were significantly correlated with tumor pathological stages, only PAQR6 upregulation was associated with Gleason score, free-prostate-specific antigen (fPSA)/total-PSA (tPSA) ratio, and patient overall survival outcomes. In addition, PAQR6 upregulation and PGR/PGRMC1 downregulation were significantly associated with a quick relapse. Conversely, in neuroendocrinal prostate cancer (NEPC) tissues, PAQR6 expression was significantly lower, but PAQR7/8 expression was higher than castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissues. PAQR8 expression was positively correlated with androgen receptor (AR) score and AR-V7 expression levels but inversely correlated with NEPC score in metastatic CRPC tumors. This study provides detailed expression profiles of membrane progesterone receptor genes in primary cancer, CRPC, and NEPC tissues.

It is documented that RIOK2 overexpressed in glioblastoma. However, whether NSC139021 can inhibit the growth of glioblastoma cells and be a potential drug for glioblastoma treatment need to be clarified. In this study, we investigated the effects of NSC139021 on human U118MG, LN-18, and mouse GL261 glioblastoma cells and the mouse models of glioblastoma. We verified that NSC139021 effectively inhibited glioblastoma cells proliferation, but it is independent of RIOK2. Our data showed that NSC139021 induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase via the Skp2-p27/p21-Cyclin E/CDK2-pRb signaling pathway in G1/S checkpoint regulation. In addition, NSC139021 also increased the apoptosis of glioblastoma cells by activating the p53 signaling pathway and increasing the levels of Bax and cleaved caspase 3. Furthermore, intraperitoneal administration of 150 mg/kg NSC139021 significantly suppressed the growth of human and mouse glioblastoma in vivo. Our study suggests that NSC139021 may be a potential chemotherapy drug for the treatment of glioblastoma by targeting the Skp2-p27/p21-Cyclin E/CDK2-pRb signaling pathway.""","""['Min Yu', 'Xiaoyan Hu', 'Jingyu Yan', 'Ying Wang', 'Fei Lu', 'Junlei Chang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomedicines""","""['Downregulation of Skp2 and p27/Kip1 synergistically induces apoptosis in T98G glioblastoma cells.', 'p27-Associated G1 arrest induced by hinokitiol in human malignant melanoma cells is mediated via down-regulation of pRb, Skp2 ubiquitin ligase, and impairment of Cdk2 function.', 'Simvastatin-induced cell cycle arrest through inhibition of STAT3/SKP2 axis and activation of AMPK to promote p27 and p21 accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Caffeic acid phenethyl ester induced cell cycle arrest and growth inhibition in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via regulation of Skp2, p53, p21Cip1 and p27Kip1.', 'Mechanisms of Cell Cycle Arrest and Apoptosis in Glioblastoma.', 'RIOK2 Contributes to Cell Growth and Protein Synthesis in Human Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'APY0201 Represses Tumor Growth through Inhibiting Autophagy in Gastric Cancer Cells.', 'Editorial of the Special Issue ""Targeted Therapies for Cancer"".']"""

There are reports that the apoptosis inhibitor of macrophage (AIM), secreted mainly by macrophages and epithelial cells, is upregulated during inflammation and facilitates immune recognition of cancerous cells by blocking human regulator of complement activation.  Objective:   These controversies around the PSA utility necessitate a reexamination of its use as a screening tool. More so, despite the suggested implication of AIM in anticancer immunosurveillance, there is a dearth of information on its role in therapy response, disease progression, and clinical outcomes of patients with PCa. These inform the present study to probe the nature and role of AIM/PSA signaling in anticancer immunity and prognosis in PCa.  Methods:   A combination of bioinformatics-aided statistical analyses, gene function annotation, and immune infiltrate analyses, coupled with tissue staining, and function assays, namely migration, invasion, and clonogenicity assays, we employed.  Results:   We demonstrated that AIM and PSA expression levels are inversely correlated in PCa clinical samples and cell lines, with AIMlowPSAhigh defining PCa, compared to AIMhighPSAlow in normal samples. Concomitant aberrant PSA and significantly suppressed AIM expression levels positively correlated with high-grade disease and characterized by advanced stage prostate cancer, regardless of mutation status. We found that a high PSA/AIM ratio is associated with disease recurrence in patients with prostate cancer but is equivocal for overall survival. In addition, PSA-associated AIM suppression is implicated in the enhanced 'metastability' of PCa and a high AIM/PSA ratio is associated with strong castration-induced regression. CRISPR-mediated AIM knockout was associated with higher PSA expression while ectopic expression of AIM significantly attenuated the migration and invasive capability of PC3 and DU145 cells. Interestingly, compared to normal samples, we observed that AIM, biomarkers of T-cell activation and M1 phenotype markers are co-suppressed in PCa samples.  Conclusion:   Herein, we demonstrate that AIM/CD5L binds to PSA and that a high PSA/AIM ratio defines advanced stage PCa (regardless of mutation status), is implicated in enhanced metastability, and associated with disease recurrence, while a high AIM/PSA ratio is associated with strong castration-induced regression. More so, the ectopic expression of AIM significantly enhances the anticancer effect of Pembrolizumab and elicits an increased CD8+ T-cell count in AIMhiPSAloPDL1+ PCa cases that are respondent to Pembrolizumab treatment.""","""['Oluwaseun Adebayo Bamodu', 'Yuan-Hung Wang', 'Chi-Tai Yeh', 'Chen-Hsun Ho', 'Yi-Te Chiang', 'Wei-Tang Kao', 'Chia-Hung Liu', 'Chia-Chang Wu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Biomedicines""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Differential but Concerted Expression of HSD17B2, HSD17B3, SHBG and SRD5A1 Testosterone Tetrad Modulate Therapy Response and Susceptibility to Disease Relapse in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1 biomarker serum immunoassay in combination with PSA is a more specific diagnostic tool for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Markers in Prostate Cancer Decision Making.', 'New circulating biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Correlations between serum levels of microRNA-148a-3p and microRNA-485-5p and the progression and recurrence of prostate cancer.']"""

In the advanced stage of PC, the cancer-cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (SEVs) may constitute a significant portion of circulating vesicles and may mediate a detectable change in the plasma vesicular miRNA profile. However, SEVs secreted by small tumor in the prostate gland constitute a tiny fraction of circulating vesicles and cause undetectable miRNA pattern changes. Thus, the isolation and miRNA profiling of a specific prostate-derived fraction of SEVs can improve the diagnostic potency of the methods based on vesicular miRNA analysis. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) was selected as a marker of prostate-derived SEVs. Super-paramagnetic beads (SPMBs) were functionalized by PSMA-binding DNA aptamer (PSMA-Apt) via a click reaction. The efficacy of SPMB-PSMA-Apt complex formation and PSMA(+)SEVs capture were assayed by flow cytometry. miRNA was isolated from the total population of SEVs and PSMA(+)SEVs of PC patients (n = 55) and healthy donors (n = 30). Four PC-related miRNAs (miR-145, miR-451a, miR-143, and miR-221) were assayed by RT-PCR. The click chemistry allowed fixing DNA aptamers onto the surface of SPMB with an efficacy of up to 89.9%. The developed method more effectively isolates PSMA(+)SEVs than relevant antibody-based technology. The analysis of PC-related miRNA in the fraction of PSMA(+)SEVs was more sensitive and revealed distinct diagnostic potency (AUC: miR-145, 0.76; miR-221, 0.7; miR-451a, 0.65; and miR-141, 0.64) than analysis of the total SEV population. Thus, isolation of prostate-specific SEVs followed by analysis of vesicular miRNA might be a promising PC diagnosis method.""","""['Lidia Zabegina', 'Inga Nazarova', 'Nadezhda Nikiforova', 'Maria Slyusarenko', 'Elena Sidina', 'Margarita Knyazeva', 'Evgenia Tsyrlina', 'Sergey Novikov', 'Sergey Reva', 'Anastasia Malek']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer through the Multi-Ligand Binding of Prostate-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and miRNA Analysis.', 'Second-generation aptamer-conjugated PSMA-targeted delivery system for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Impact of Extracellular Vesicle Isolation Methods on Downstream Mirna Analysis in Semen: A Comparative Study.', 'Role of miRNA-145, 148, and 185 and Stem Cells in Prostate Cancer.', 'The roles of small extracellular vesicles in lung cancer: Molecular pathology, mechanisms, diagnostics, and therapeutics.', 'Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer through the Multi-Ligand Binding of Prostate-Derived Extracellular Vesicles and miRNA Analysis.', 'Current Status of Research on Small Extracellular Vesicles for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Urological Tumors.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Overview of MicroRNAs as Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers for High-Incidence Cancers in 2021.', 'Aptamers as Theragnostic Tools in Prostate Cancer.']"""
