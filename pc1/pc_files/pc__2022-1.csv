Materials and methods:   Total 2,702 PCa samples and 7,485 controls were used to discover csPCa susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Males with biopsy-proven or post-radical prostatectomy Gleason score 7 or higher were included for analysis. After genotype imputation for quality control, logistic regression models were applied to test association and calculate effect size. Extracted candidate SNPs were further tested to compare predictive performance according to number of SNPs included in the PRS. The best-fit model was validated in an independent cohort of 311 cases and 822 controls.  Results:   Of the 83 candidate SNPs with significant PCa association reported in previous literature, rs72725879 located in PRNCR1 showed the highest significance for PCa risk (odds ratio, 0.597; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.555-0.641; p=4.3×10-45). Thirty-two SNPs within 26 distinct loci were further selected for PRS construction. Best performance was found with the top 29 SNPs, with AUC found to be 0.700 (95% CI, 0.667-0.734). Males with very-high PRS (above the 95th percentile) had a 4.92-fold increased risk for csPCa.  Conclusions:   Ethnic-specific PRS was developed and validated in Korean males to predict csPCa susceptibility using the largest csPCa sample size in Asia. PRS can be a potential biomarker to predict individual risk. Future multi-ethnic trials are required to further validate our results.""","""['Sang Hun Song#', 'Eunae Kim#', 'Eunjin Woo', 'Eunkyung Kwon', 'Sungroh Yoon', 'Jung Kwon Kim', 'Hakmin Lee', 'Jong Jin Oh', 'Sangchul Lee', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Polygenic risk score for tumor aggressiveness and early-onset prostate cancer in Asians.', 'Validation of a prostate cancer polygenic risk score.', 'Evaluation of polygenic risk scores for ovarian cancer risk prediction in a prospective cohort study.', 'How Well do Polygenic Risk Scores Identify Men at High Risk for Prostate Cancer?

The secondary outcome was to identify patient and disease characteristics affecting physician's choice of either therapy.  Materials and methods:   A total of 297 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2008 and 2014 were identified from a single academic center's cancer database. Clinical information including age, ethnicity, comorbidities, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, stage, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, biochemical recurrence, hospital readmissions, and survival outcomes were gathered and analyzed from ambulatory medical records until 2018.  Results:   Patients selected for radiotherapy were older and had more comorbidities and NCCN high-risk disease. Biochemical recurrence was higher after radical prostatectomy for locally advanced disease, 59.3% vs. 20.0% (p<0.001), favoring radiotherapy. Hospital readmission was higher for patients with locally advanced disease undergoing radiotherapy, 48.6% vs. 18.5% (p=0.002), and 35.2% vs. 19.7% (p=0.044) for those with localized disease, with most of these readmissions occurring 24 months after the initial therapy. Radiation proctitis and colitis were the most common complications after radiotherapy and accounted for 46.3% of readmissions.  Conclusions:   Selection of patients for radiotherapy instead of surgery was influenced by age, significant comorbidities, and NCCN high-risk disease. The incidence of treatment- or cancer-related hospital readmissions was significantly higher for patients undergoing radiotherapy compared with radical prostatectomy, especially for those with locally advanced prostate cancer. This information may be useful in guiding a patient's choice of therapy.""","""['Arshvin Kesavan', 'Keeran Vickneson', 'Kesavan Esuvaranathan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['Prostate cancer-specific survival following salvage radiotherapy vs observation in men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Outcomes of treatment for localized prostate cancer in a single institution: comparison of radical prostatectomy and radiation therapy by propensity score matching analysis.', 'Prostate-specific antigen level, stage or Gleason score: which is best for predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, and does it vary by the outcome being measured?

We hypothesized that larger cribriform patterns would be associated with increased Decipher scores and higher biochemical recurrence (BCR) risk in Gleason 3+4=7 prostatectomy patients.  Materials and methods:   The slide from patients who underwent prostatectomy from January 2016 to March 2020 on which Decipher was performed was re-reviewed for Gleason score and cribriform patterns, with large cribriform defined as cribriform acini with greater than 12 lumens and simple cribriform as 12 or fewer lumens. Differences in Decipher score were analyzed in a generalized linear model controlling for pathology stage and tumor margin status. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was performed for BCR-free survival.  Results:   Of 337 cases, 118 were Gleason 3+4=7. The mean Decipher scores in 3+4=7 cases without cribriform, with simple cribriform, and with large cribriform were 0.41, 0.54, and 0.62, respectively. In a multivariable model with pathology stage, margin tumor length, and percentage pattern 4 as covariates, compared to cases without cribriform, simple cribriform was associated with 0.10 increase in Decipher (p=0.03) and 4.7-fold hazard ratio of BCR (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-56.5; p=0.22) and large cribriform was associated with 0.17 increase in Decipher (p<0.001) and 16.0-fold hazard ratio of BCR (95% CI, 1.4-181.2; p=0.02).  Conclusions:   Among Gleason 3+4=7 carcinomas, large cribriform was associated with higher Decipher scores and greater BCR risk.

Materials and methods:   The cases of BCG-related GP in 24 male (mean age ± standard deviation, 66.0 ± 9.4 years; range, 50-88 years) pathologically confirmed between January 2011 and April 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. All patients underwent intravesical BCG therapy followed by a MRI scan. Additional follow-up MRI scans, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), were performed in 19 patients. The BCG-related GP cases were categorized into three: A, B, or C. The lesions with diffusion restriction and homogeneous enhancement were classified as type A. The lesions with diffusion restriction and a poorly enhancing component were classified as type B. A low signal intensity on high b-value DWI (b = 1000 s/mm²) was considered characteristic of type C. Two radiologists independently interpreted the MRI scans before making a consensus about the types.  Results:   The median lesion size was 22 mm with the interquartile range (IQR) of 18-26 mm as measured using the initial MRI scans. The lesion types were A, B, and C in 7, 15, and 2 patients, respectively. Cohen's kappa value for the inter-reader agreement for the interpretation of the lesion types was 0.837. On the last follow-up MRI scans of 19 patients, the size decreased (median, 5.8 mm; IQR, 3.4-8.5 mm), and the type changed from A or B to C in 11 patients. The lesions resolved in four patients. In five patients who underwent prostatectomy, caseous necrosis on histopathology matched with the non-enhancing components of type B lesions and the entire type C lesions.  Conclusion:   BCG-related GP demonstrated three imaging patterns on multiparametric MRI.

Patients with cancer are at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19, but it is not well known whether COVID-19 outcomes in this patient population were associated with geography.  Objective:   To quantify spatiotemporal variation in COVID-19 outcomes among patients with cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This registry-based retrospective cohort study included patients with a historical diagnosis of invasive malignant neoplasm and laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between March and November 2020. Data were collected from cancer care delivery centers in the United States.  Exposures:   Patient residence was categorized into 9 US census divisions. Cancer center characteristics included academic or community classification, rural-urban continuum code (RUCC), and social vulnerability index.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. The secondary composite outcome consisted of receipt of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, and all-cause death. Multilevel mixed-effects models estimated associations of center-level and census division-level exposures with outcomes after adjustment for patient-level risk factors and quantified variation in adjusted outcomes across centers, census divisions, and calendar time.  Results:   Data for 4749 patients (median [IQR] age, 66 [56-76] years; 2439 [51.4%] female individuals, 1079 [22.7%] non-Hispanic Black individuals, and 690 [14.5%] Hispanic individuals) were reported from 83 centers in the Northeast (1564 patients [32.9%]), Midwest (1638 [34.5%]), South (894 [18.8%]), and West (653 [13.8%]). After adjustment for patient characteristics, including month of COVID-19 diagnosis, estimated 30-day mortality rates ranged from 5.2% to 26.6% across centers. Patients from centers located in metropolitan areas with population less than 250 000 (RUCC 3) had lower odds of 30-day mortality compared with patients from centers in metropolitan areas with population at least 1 million (RUCC 1) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.11-0.84). The type of center was not significantly associated with primary or secondary outcomes. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome rates across the 9 census divisions, but adjusted mortality rates significantly improved over time (eg, September to November vs March to May: aOR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.17-0.58).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this registry-based cohort study, significant differences in COVID-19 outcomes across US census divisions were not observed. However, substantial heterogeneity in COVID-19 outcomes across cancer care delivery centers was found. Attention to implementing standardized guidelines for the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19 could improve outcomes for these vulnerable patients.""","""['Jessica E Hawley', 'Tianyi Sun', 'David D Chism', 'Narjust Duma', 'Julie C Fu', 'Na Tosha N Gatson', 'Sanjay Mishra', 'Ryan H Nguyen', 'Sonya A Reid', 'Oscar K Serrano', 'Sunny R K Singh', 'Neeta K Venepalli', 'Ziad Bakouny', 'Babar Bashir', 'Mehmet A Bilen', 'Paolo F Caimi', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Scott J Dawsey', 'Leslie A Fecher', 'Daniel B Flora', 'Christopher R Friese', 'Michael J Glover', 'Cyndi J Gonzalez', 'Sharad Goyal', 'Thorvardur R Halfdanarson', 'Dawn L Hershman', 'Hina Khan', 'Chris Labaki', 'Mark A Lewis', 'Rana R McKay', 'Ian Messing', 'Nathan A Pennell', 'Matthew Puc', 'Deepak Ravindranathan', 'Terence D Rhodes', 'Andrea V Rivera', 'John Roller', 'Gary K Schwartz', 'Sumit A Shah', 'Justin A Shaya', 'Mitrianna Streckfuss', 'Michael A Thompson', 'Elizabeth M Wulff-Burchfield', 'Zhuoer Xie', 'Peter Paul Yu', 'Jeremy L Warner', 'Dimpy P Shah', 'Benjamin French', 'Clara Hwang;COVID- and Cancer Consortium (CCC)']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Error in Nonauthor Collaborator Name.', 'Risk Factors for Hospitalization, Mechanical Ventilation, or Death Among 10\u202f131 US Veterans With SARS-CoV-2 Infection.', 'Variation in Clinical Treatment and Outcomes by Race Among US Veterans Hospitalized With COVID-19.', 'Trends in Patient Characteristics and COVID-19 In-Hospital Mortality in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Clinical Characteristics and Morbidity Associated With Coronavirus Disease 2019 in a Series of Patients in Metropolitan Detroit.', 'Social Vulnerability and Location of Death in Heart Failure in the United States.', 'Role of Oral Intake, Mobility, and Activity Measures in Informing Discharge Recommendations for Hospitalized Inmate and Noninmate Patients With COVID-19: Retrospective Analysis.', 'The social vulnerability index as a risk stratification tool for health disparity research in cancer patients: a scoping review.', 'Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 infections among patients with cancer following two and three doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines: a retrospective observational study from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium.', 'Error in Nonauthor Collaborator Name.']"""

Materials and methods:   Men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy who were studied by prostatectomy bed magnetic resonance imaging for suspected local recurrence were retrospectively evaluated. Locally recurrent tumors were noted and measured from imaging reports. Patients with nodal/bone lesions at the time of imaging were excluded. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to assess systemic progression-free and prostate cancer-specific survival.  Results:   A total of 896 men were enrolled and the imaging positive and negative groups for local recurrent tumor consisted of 441 and 455 men, respectively. On univariate analysis, preoperative prostate specific antigen (p=0.02), clinical tumor stage (p=0.006), pathological Gleason score from prostatectomy (p=0.02), subsequent salvage radiotherapy (p <0.001), biochemical recurrence to magnetic resonance imaging time interval (p <0.001), age at magnetic resonance imaging (p=0.047) and prostate specific antigen at magnetic resonance imaging (p <0.001) were significantly different between magnetic resonance imaging positive and negative groups. Patients with negative magnetic resonance imaging results had worse systemic progression-free survival rates (p=0.025) and better prostate cancer-specific survival (p=0.016) than those with recurrence. Larger lesion size significantly increased risk of prostate cancer death (hazard ratio: 1.07; p <0.001). On multivariable analysis, pathological Gleason scores ≥7 were independent prognostic factors of systemic progression (p <0.05).  Conclusions:   Prostatectomy bed magnetic resonance imaging provides long-term prognostic information for the evaluation of patients with biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy. Post-prostatectomy patients with recurrent lesions on imaging had longer progression-free survival but shorter prostate cancer-specific survival compared to those without lesions. Additionally, those with larger lesions were associated with poorer cancer-specific survival.""","""['Takashi Tanaka', 'Akira Kawashima', 'Laureano J Rangel', 'Phillip J Schulte', 'Adam T Froemming', 'Bernard F King', 'Lance A Mynderse', 'R Jeffrey Karnes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Pathological and 3 Tesla Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Correlation with Whole Mount Histopathology.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Is an Independent Predictor of Salvage Radiotherapy Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic factors after salvage radiotherapy alone in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Planning of Salvage Radiotherapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'PI-RR: The Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting System for MRI Assessment of Local Prostate Cancer Recurrence After Radiation Therapy or Radical Prostatectomy-A Review.']"""

We aim to determine the impact of continuing AS and delayed definitive treatment after biopsy progression on oncologic outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Participants in our prospective AS cohort (1990-2018) diagnosed with grade group (GG) 1, localized prostate cancer, with prostate specific antigen <20 who were subsequently upgraded to ≥GG2, and underwent further surveillance (biopsy/imaging/prostate specific antigen) were identified. Patients were stratified by post-progression followup into 3 groups: continue AS untreated, pursue early radical prostatectomy (RP) ≤6 months, or undergo late RP within 6 months to 5 years of progression. Patients receiving other treatments were excluded. We compared characteristics between groups and examined the associations of early vs late RP with risk of adverse pathology (AP) at RP and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after RP.  Results:   Of 531 patients with biopsy progression and further surveillance 214 (40%) remained untreated, 192 (36%) pursued early RP and 125 (24%) underwent late RP. Among patients who underwent early vs late RP, there was no difference in GG (p=0.15) or AP (55% vs 53%, p=0.74) rate at RP, or 3-year RFS (80% vs 87%, log-rank p=0.64) after RP. In multivariable models, only Cancer of Prostate Risk Assessment post-surgical score was associated with risk of RFS (HR=1.42 per point, 95% CI 1.24-1.64).  Conclusions:   Among patients continuing AS after biopsy progression, 60% underwent surgery within 5 years. Delayed surgery after progression was not associated with higher risk of AP or RFS.

Methods:   We assessed 144 patients (group with toggling, n = 72; group without toggling, n = 72) who underwent RARP with bilateral NVB sparing using propensity score matching. Inclusion criteria were ≥ 1 year follow-up and preoperative potency as per the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaire (≥ 17 points). Recovery of ED after RARP was defined as return to baseline sexual function or self-assessment regarding successful intercourse. The subjective surgeon's nerve sparing (SNS) score and tunneling success rates were used to evaluate surgical facilitation. The recovery rate of ED between the groups was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis.  Results:   A better ED recovery trend was confirmed according to the SNS score (R² = 0.142, P = 0.004). In the analysis of NVB sparing ease, the toggling group showed higher SNS scores (on right/left side: P = 0.011 and < 0.001, respectively) and overall tunneling success rates (87% vs. 74%, P = 0.001) than the group without toggling. Overall, ED recovery rates were 82% (59/72) and 75% (54/72) in the groups with and without toggling, respectively, at the 1-year follow-up (P = 0.047), and the toggling group showed a faster ED recovery rate at 3 months (47% vs. 35%, P = 0.013). In a specific analysis of the potent cohort (< 60 years, bilateral full NVB spared, SHIM score ≥ 22), the ED recovery rate reached 87% (14/16) in the toggling group.

Occasional studies have also indicated prognostic utility of CK19 in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas, with better prognosis among squamous cell carcinoma cases with strong CK19 immunostaining. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and potential roles of CK19 immunostaining in cases of carcinoma lung as well as other metastatic intrathoracic neoplasms.  Methods:   This was a prospective single-center study of 2 years duration, during which 233 cases of endobronchial ultrasound guided aspiration of the intrathoracic lesions were examined. After excluding the cases without cellblock, with inadequate samples, with benign diagnosis, and excluding the lymphoma cases, finally 31 neoplastic cases were evaluated for expression of cytokeratin 19.  Results:   Diffuse cytoplasmic staining for CK19 was noted in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas (18/19 cases), while the expression in small cell carcinomas was low (2/5 cases). CK19 was also positive in mediastinal lymph node metastasis from a case each of papillary thyroid carcinoma, prostatic adenocarcinoma and infiltrating ductal carcinoma breast (1/2 cases).

This study was undertaken to determine the postoperative observation time by investigating the hazard rate for prostate-specific antigen failure and other-cause death using Weibull analysis.  Methods:   We included 612 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer between June 2002 and December 2017. Risk classification was categorized by the D'Amico risk classification, and the patients were divided into three age groups: <60, 60-69 and ≥70 years. The hazard rates at each point were derived using Weibull analysis. The optimal observation time after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy was determined as the intersection point at which the hazard rate of other-cause death overtakes the hazard rate of prostate-specific antigen failure.  Results:   In all groups classified by age, the hazard rate of other-cause deaths increased over time. In contrast, the hazard rate of prostate-specific antigen failure decreased gradually. The ≥70 years age group showed the highest hazard rate. The hazard rate of prostate-specific antigen failure was highest in the high-risk group. The patients aged ≥70 and 60-69 years in the low-risk group were recommended 6 years 6 months and 14 years 8 months, respectively, for observation. The remaining patients were recommended >25 years of postsurgical observation.  Conclusions:   The observation time after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy could be estimated by comparing the estimated hazard rates of prostate-specific antigen failure and other-cause death based on Weibull analysis.

They are mainly caused by multifactorial mechanisms and are genetically heterogeneous. We investigated the genetic architecture of these cancers through genome-wide association, pathway-based, and summary-based transcriptome-/methylome-wide association analyses using three independent cohorts. Our genome-wide association analyses identified the associations of 33 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at P < 5E - 06, of which 32 SNPs were not previously reported and did not have proxy variants within their ± 1 Mb flanking regions. Moreover, other polymorphisms mapped to their closest genes were not previously associated with the same cancers at P < 5E - 06. Our pathway enrichment analyses revealed associations of 32 pathways; mainly related to the immune system, DNA replication/transcription, and chromosomal organization; with the studied cancers. Also, 60 probes were associated with these cancers in our transcriptome-wide and methylome-wide analyses. The ± 1 Mb flanking regions of most probes had not attained P < 5E - 06 in genome-wide association studies. The genes corresponding to the significant probes can be considered as potential targets for further functional studies. Two genes (i.e., CDC14A and PMEL) demonstrated stronger evidence of associations with lung cancer as they had significant probes in both transcriptome-wide and methylome-wide association analyses.

Objective:   To clinically, epidemiologically, and experimentally evaluate the effect of antiandrogens on SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Designs, settings, and participants:   A randomized phase 2 clinical trial (COVIDENZA) enrolled 42 hospitalized COVID-19 patients before safety evaluation. We also conducted a population-based retrospective study of 7894 SARS-CoV-2-positive prostate cancer patients and an experimental study using an air-liquid interface three-dimensional culture model of primary lung cells.  Intervention:   In COVIDENZA, patients were randomized 2:1 to 5 d of enzalutamide or standard of care.  Outcome measurements:   The primary outcomes in COVIDENZA were the time to mechanical ventilation or discharge from hospital. The population-based study investigated risk of hospitalization, intensive care, and death from COVID-19 after androgen inhibition.  Results and limitations:   Enzalutamide-treated patients required longer hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR] for discharge from hospital 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20-0.93) and the trial was terminated early. In the epidemiological study, no preventive effects were observed. The frail population of patients treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in combination with abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide had a higher risk of dying from COVID-19 (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.52-4.16). In vitro data showed no effect of enzalutamide on virus replication. The epidemiological study has limitations that include residual confounders.  Conclusions:   The results do not support a therapeutic effect of enzalutamide or preventive effects of bicalutamide or ADT in COVID-19. Thus, these antiandrogens should not be used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients or as prevention for COVID-19. Further research on these therapeutics in this setting are not warranted.

Objective:   To estimate the risk of high-grade prostate cancer on biopsy based on a family history of cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a multicenter study of men undergoing prostate biopsy from 2006 to 2019, including 12 sites in North America and Europe. All sites recorded first-degree prostate cancer family histories; four included more detailed data on the number of affected relatives, second-degree relatives with prostate cancer, and breast cancer family history.  Outcomes measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable logistic regressions evaluated odds of high-grade (Gleason grade group ≥2) prostate cancer. Separate models were fit for family history definitions, including first- and second-degree prostate cancer and breast cancer family histories.  Results and limitations:   A first-degree prostate cancer family history was available for 15 799 men, with a more detailed family history for 4617 (median age 65 yr, both cohorts). Adjusted odds of high-grade prostate cancer were 1.77 times greater (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.57-2.00, p < 0.001, risk ratio [RR] = 1.40) with first-degree prostate cancer, 1.38 (95% CI 1.07-1.77, p = 0.011, RR = 1.22) for second-degree prostate cancer, and 1.30 (95% CI 1.01-1.67, p = 0.040, RR = 1.18) for first-degree breast cancer family histories. Interaction terms revealed that the effect of a family history did not differ based on prostate-specific antigen but differed based on age. This study is limited by missing data on race and prior negative biopsy.  Conclusions:   Men with indications for biopsy and a family history of prostate or breast cancer can be counseled that they have a moderately increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, independent of other risk factors.

Objective.—:   To assess the clinical impact of T3a lesions (ie, extraprostatic extension other than bladder neck invasion [BNI] or SVI [EPE], microscopic bladder neck invasion [mBNI]) in pT3b disease.  Design.—:   We compared radical prostatectomy findings and long-term oncologic outcomes in 248 patients with pT3b disease, with versus without EPE/mBNI.  Results.—:   Extraprostatic extension/mBNI was found in 219 (88.3%)/48 (19.4%) cases, respectively. Extraprostatic extension was significantly associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, higher rates of positive surgical margin (pSM) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and larger tumor volume. Similarly, mBNI was significantly associated with higher PSA level, higher rates of Grade Group(s) 4-5 or 5, pSM, LVI, and pN1, and larger tumor volume. Significant differences in all of these clinicopathologic features (except lymph node metastasis) between EPE-/mBNI+ or EPE+/mBNI- and EPE+/mBNI+ cases were also observed. Outcome analysis revealed that patients with EPE (P < .001) or mBNI (P < .001) had a significantly higher risk of disease progression than respective controls. Notably, there were significant differences in progression-free survival between EPE-/mBNI+ or EPE+/mBNI- cases and EPE-/mBNI- (P = .001) or EPE+/mBNI+ (P < .001) cases.

We have reported separately remarkable effects of the 2,2-difluorovinyl (DFV) group at the C3' position, as well as those of the CF3O and CHF2O groups at the 3-position of the C2-benzoyl moiety of the 2nd- and 3rd-generation taxoids on their potency and pharmacological properties. Thus, it was very natural for us to investigate the combination of these two modifications in the 3rd-generation taxoids and to find out whether these two modifications are cooperative at the binding site in the β-tubulin or not, as well as to see how these effects are reflected in the biological activities of the new 3rd-generation DFV-taxoids. Accordingly, we designed, synthesized and fully characterized 14 new 3rd-generation DFV-taxoids. These new DFV-taxoids exhibited remarkable cytotoxicity against human breast, lung, colon, pancreatic and prostate cancer cell lines. All of these new DFV-taxoids exhibited subnanomolar IC50 values against drug-sensitive cell lines, A549, HT29, Vcap and PC3, as well as CFPAC-1. All of the novel DFV-taxoids exhibited 2-4 orders of magnitude greater potency against extremely drug-resistant cancer cell lines, LCC6-MDR and DLD-1, as compared to paclitaxel, indicating that these new DFV-taxoids can overcome MDR caused by the overexpression of Pgp and other ABC cassette transporters. Dose-response (kill) curve analysis of the new DFV-taxoids in LCC6-MDR and DLD-1 cell lines revealed highly impressive profiles of several new DFV-taxoids. The cooperative effects of the combination of the 3'-DFV group and 3-CF3O/CHF2O-benzoyl moiety at the C2 position were investigated in detail by molecular docking analysis. We found that both the 3'-DFV moiety and the 3-CF3O/3-CHF2O group of the C2-benzoate moiety are nicely accommodated to the deep hydrophobic pocket of the paclitaxel/taxoid binding site in the β-tubulin, enabling an enhanced binding mode through unique attractive interactions between fluorine/CF3O/CHF2O and the protein beyond those of paclitaxel and new-generation taxoids without bearing organofluorine groups, which are reflected in the remarkable potency of the new 3rd-generation DFV-taxoids.""","""['Changwei Wang', 'Lei Chen', 'Yi Sun', 'Wanrong Guo', 'Adam K Taouil', 'Iwao Ojima']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Design, synthesis and SAR study of 3rd-generation taxoids bearing 3-CH3, 3-CF3O and 3-CHF2O groups at the C2-benzoate position.', 'Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of new-generation taxoids.', 'Modification of C-seco taxoids through ring tethering and substituent replacement leading to effective agents against tumor drug resistance mediated by βIII-Tubulin and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpressions.', 'Recent advances in the new generation taxane anticancer agents.', 'Recent advances in the chemistry and biology of new generation taxoids.', 'Qilongtian ameliorate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice via inhibiting IL-17 signal pathway.', 'Taxoids-rich extract from Taxus wallichiana alleviates high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice through inhibition of low-grade inflammation.']"""

Materials and methods:   One hundred fourteen DL algorithms were developed on 295 prostate MRIs to segment the prostate, external urinary sphincter (EUS), seminal vesicles (SV), rectum, and bladder. Fifty prostate MRIs of 25 patients undergoing MRI-based low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy were acquired as an independent test set. Groups of DL algorithms were created based on the loss functions used to train them, and the spatial entropy (SE) of their predictions on the 50 test MRIs was computed. Five human observers contoured the 50 test MRIs, and SE maps of their contours were compared with those of the groups of the DL algorithms. Additionally, similarity metrics were computed between DL algorithm predictions and consensus annotations of the 5 human observers' contours of the 50 test MRIs.

We investigated on-board MRI images from MRI-guided SBRT to better understand this.  Materials and methods:   Twenty consecutive patients treated with MRI-guided prostate SBRT (40 Gy/5 fractions) enrolled on the MRI arm of a phase III randomized trial were included. A 2 mm isotropic margin was used for prostate and proximal SVPTV. Target volume, prostate dimensions, angles of the proximal SV on axial (angle α) and sagittal view (angle θ) were measured on a 0.35 T simulation MRI and five on-board pre-treatment MRIs. Dice coefficient of the targets and target dosimetry were calculated.  Results:   All patients experienced an isotropic increase in prostate volume during SBRT (p = 0.0016): 0.1%, 9.0%, 12.1%, 15.1%, and 14.2% (median) at fractions 1-5, respectively, regardless of baseline volume, which was significantly reduced with neoadjuvant ADT (p = 0.0042). There was minimal interfraction rotation of prostate, however, considerable variations in proximal SV angle α (median 21.5°) and angle θ (median 17.6°) were seen. Median V100% was 97.5% and 87.1% for prostate and proximal SV CTV, respectively. V95%≥95% was achieved in 94% of fractions for the prostate and in 59% for proximal SV.  Conclusion:   Prostate volume consistently increased during SBRT. Interfraction prostatic rotation was minimal while rotation of the proximal SV was considerable. Prostate dosimetry was favorable, but online adaptive therapy may be indicated occasionally to account for prostatic swelling and in particular proximal SV rotations.""","""['Ting Martin Ma', 'Jack Neylon', 'Maria Casado', 'Sahil Sharma', 'Ke Sheng', 'Daniel Low', 'Yingli Yang', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'James Lamb', 'Minsong Cao', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Dosimetric implications of residual seminal vesicle motion in fiducial-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The role of adaptive planning in margin-reduced, MRI-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy to the prostate bed following radical prostatectomy: Post-hoc analysis of a phase II clinical trial.', 'Residual seminal vesicle displacement in marker-based image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer and the impact on margin design.', 'Prostate bed and organ-at-risk deformation: Prospective volumetric and dosimetric data from a phase II trial of stereotactic body radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy.', 'Seminal vesicle inter- and intra-fraction motion during radiotherapy for prostate cancer: A review.', 'Dosimetric Impact of Intrafraction Prostate Motion and Interfraction Anatomical Changes in Dose-Escalated Linac-Based SBRT.', 'Advancing the treatment of localized prostate cancer with MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Reducing PTV margins for prostate SBRT with motion compensation and gating techniques.', 'Urethral Interfractional Geometric and Dosimetric Variations of Prostate Cancer Patients: A Study Using an Onboard MRI.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided radiotherapy for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer: Trade-off between planning target volume margin and online plan adaption.']"""

As cancer cells adapt themselves in a suspended state in the blood stream before penetration and regrowth at distal tissues, understanding their survival strategy in an anchorage-independent condition is important to develop appropriate therapeutics. We have previously generated adapted suspension cells (ASCs) from parental adherent cancer cells to study the characteristics of circulating tumor cells. In this study, we explored metabolic rewiring in MDA-MB-468 ASCs to adapt to suspension growth conditions through extracellular flux analyses and various metabolic assays. We also determined the relationship between AKT activation and metabolic rewiring in ASCs using the AKT inhibitor, MK2206. ASCs reprogramed metabolism to enhance glycolysis and basal oxygen consumption rate. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the upregulation in the genes related to glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. The changes in the metabolic program led to a remarkable dependency of ASCs on carbohydrates as an energy source for proliferation as compared to parental adherent cells (ADs). AKT activation was observed in ASCs and those generated from pancreatic and other breast cancer cells, and AKT activation inhibition in ASCs decreased glycolysis and oxygen consumption. AKT activation is an important strategy for obtaining energy through the enhancement of glycolysis in ASCs. The regulation of AKT activity and/or glycolysis may provide a strong therapeutic strategy to prevent the metastatic spread of cancer cells.""","""['Hyun Jeong Joo', 'Ga Eun Chung', 'Sora Han', 'Hye In Ka', 'Su Jung Soh', 'Young Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['High Sensitivity of Circulating Tumor Cells Derived from a Colorectal Cancer Patient for Dual Inhibition with AKT and mTOR Inhibitors.', 'Rewiring carbohydrate catabolism differentially affects survival of pancreatic cancer cell lines with diverse metabolic profiles.', 'Functional Role of mTORC2 versus Integrin-Linked Kinase in Mediating Ser473-Akt Phosphorylation in PTEN-Negative Prostate and Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Metabolic phenotype of bladder cancer.', 'Targeting cancer-specific metabolic pathways for developing novel cancer therapeutics.']"""

Purpose:   The study explores how nurse practitioners (NPs) perceived their preparation and competency in providing a range of sexual and reproductive health care in their first two years of community-based practice.  Methodological orientation:   Qualitative. Thematic analysis used to analyze data from structured and open-ended interview questions.  Sample:   Through snowballing recruitment, 35 NPs participated in interviews.  Conclusions:   Participants were most confident and likely to provide contraceptive and sexually transmitted infection services. Participants felt less prepared to provide male sexual health and care to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex+ population. Nurse practitioners expressed interest in building skills with discussing healthy sexuality across the life span, specifically postmenopausal sexual concerns, teen sexuality, trauma-informed care related to sexual violence, and early pregnancy decision making. Some participants had little preparation in early pregnancy decision making/options counseling. Faculty need to examine barriers to teaching these skills because the curriculum should address all legal pregnancy options, including discussing the NP's professional obligations. More preparation was needed in the clinical management of erectile dysfunction, polycystic ovary syndrome, herpes, syphilis, abnormal uterine bleeding, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, miscarriage management, and how to discuss prostate cancer screening.

One of the stringent tests for QM/MM and/or QM approaches is to provide quantitative answers to real-world biochemical questions, such as the effect of single-point mutations on enzyme kinetics. This translates into predicting the relative activation energies to 1-2 kcal·mol-1 accuracy; such predictions can be used for the rational design of novel enzyme variants with desired/improved characteristics. Herein, we employ glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), a dizinc metallopeptidase, also known as the prostate specific membrane antigen, as a model system. The structure and activity of this major cancer antigen have been thoroughly studied, both experimentally and computationally, which makes it an ideal model system for method development. Its reaction mechanism is quite well understood: the reaction coordinate comprises a ""tetrahedral intermediate"" and two transition states and experimental activation Gibbs free energy of ∼17.5 kcal·mol-1 can be inferred for the known kcat ≈ 1 s-1. We correlate experimental kinetic data (including the E424H variant, newly characterized in this work) for various GCPII mutants (kcat = 8.6 × 10-5 s-1 to 2.7 s-1) with the energy profiles calculated by QM/MM and QM-only (cluster model) approaches. We show that the near-quantitative agreement between the experimental values and the calculated activation energies (ΔH⧧) can be obtained and recommend the combination of the two protocols: QM/MM optimized structures and cluster model (QM) energetics. The trend in relative activation energies is mostly independent of the QM method (DFT functional) used. Last but not least, a satisfactory correlation between experimental and theoretical data allows us to provide qualitative and fairly simple explanations of the observed kinetic effects which are thus based on a rigorous footing.""","""['Daniel Bím', 'Michal Navrátil', 'Ondrej Gutten', 'Jan Konvalinka', 'Zsófia Kutil', 'Martin Culka', 'Václav Navrátil', 'Anastassia N Alexandrova', 'Cyril Bařinka', 'Lubomír Rulíšek']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Phys Chem B""","""['Two Sides of Quantum-Based Modeling of Enzyme-Catalyzed Reactions: Mechanistic and Electronic Structure Aspects of the Hydrolysis by Glutamate Carboxypeptidase.', 'Reaction mechanism of glutamate carboxypeptidase II revealed by mutagenesis, X-ray crystallography, and computational methods.', 'Model Setup and Procedures for Prediction of Enzyme Reaction Kinetics with QM-Only and QM:MM Approaches.', 'Progress in ab initio QM/MM free-energy simulations of electrostatic energies in proteins: accelerated QM/MM studies of pKa, redox reactions and solvation free energies.', 'The Importance of the MM Environment and the Selection of the QM Method in QM/MM Calculations: Applications to Enzymatic Reactions.', 'Comprehensive Mechanistic View of the Hydrolysis of Oxadiazole-Based Inhibitors by Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC6).', 'A Guide to In Silico Drug Design.', 'Characterization of glutamate carboxypeptidase 2 orthologs in trematodes.']"""

However, published studies reporting conflicting results have design limitations with insufficient data at the extremes of age. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of age on post-RARP urinary continence.  Materials and methods:   This study included 5,648 patients from 2 prospective Australian databases who underwent a primary RARP for prostate cancer between 2008 and 2019. Significant urinary bother and pad-usage were evaluated 12 months post-RARP by EPIC-26 (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) questionnaires, independently collected by third parties. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between continence and age.  Results:   Percentages of significant bother increased with age: 4.2%, 6.8% 9.1% and 12.9% at age groups <55, 55-64, 65-74 and ≥75 years, respectively. Compared with men aged 65-69 years, the odds of significant bother in patients <55 years was significantly lower (odds ratio [OR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.75, p=0.001). Corresponding OR found no significant difference in bother in patients ≥70 (OR 1.24, 95% CI 0.94-1.63, p=0.13) or ≥75 years (OR 1.41, 95% CI 0.88-2.25, p=0.16).

Among these, patients who had undergone a previous TURP (Group A) were compared with those without TURP (Group B) using the Survival, Continence, and Potency outcomes reporting system. Using propensity score matching for age, PSA and Gleason score, the two cohorts were further subdivided in a 1:2 ratio into Group C (prior TURP from Group A) and Group D (without prior TURP from Group B). Similar comparisons were made between Group C and D. Patients in Group A (n = 40) had lower PSA (p = 0.031) and were more likely to have Gleason grade 1 disease (p = 0.035) than patients in Group B (n = 143). In the propensity-matched group analysis, patients of Group C (n = 38) had higher operative time and blood loss than Group D (n = 76) patients. Group C patients also had lower continence at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. However, oncological and potency outcomes were similar in both the groups. We concluded that previous TURP is a predictor for surgical and continence outcomes following RARP.

Therefore, modulation of PTEN and CDKN1B expression might be a promising therapeutic approach for PCa treatment. Expression of PTEN and CDKN1B was verified in specimens from PCa patients and transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice. The effect of PTEN on PCa cell migration, apoptosis, and the cell cycle was analyzed in vitro using a wound-healing assay and flow cytometry. We assessed the ability of intraprostatic and intratumoral injections of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) 9 expressing Pten or Cdkn1b into TRAMP mice and a subcutaneous tumor xenograft mouse model, respectively, to inhibit PCa progression. PTEN and CDKN1B were significantly downregulated in human and mouse PCa samples, and CDKN1B expression correlated positively with PTEN expression. PTEN overexpression significantly inhibited cell migration and cell-cycle progression and promoted apoptosis in PCa cells by decreasing Ccnd1 expression and increasing that of Cdkn1b. Importantly, treatment with the rAAV9.Pten or rAAV9.Cdkn1b extended the lifespan of TRAMP mice and inhibited the growth rate of tumor xenografts by regulating downstream gene expression.

Most conventional biomarkers are based on bulk tissue analysis, which cannot address the complexity of single-cell heterogeneity responsible for drug resistance. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative drug response predictive biomarker approaches that could directly interrogate single-cell and whole population cancer cell drug sensitivity. In this study, we report a novel method exploiting bioluminescence microscopy to detect single prostate cancer (PCa) cell response to androgen receptor (AR)-axis-targeted therapies (ARAT) and predict cell population sensitivity. Methods: We have generated a new adenovirus-delivered biosensor, PCA3-Cre-PSEBC-ITSTA, which combines an integrated two-step transcriptional amplification system (ITSTA) and the activities of the prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) and modified prostate-specific antigen (PSEBC) gene promoters as a single output driving the firefly luciferase reporter gene. This system was tested on PCa cell lines and on primary PCa cells. Single cells, exposed or not to ARAT, were dynamically imaged by bioluminescence microscopy. A linear discriminant analysis (LDA)-based method was used to determine cell population sensitivities to ARAT. Results: We show that the PCA3-Cre-PSEBC-ITSTA biosensor is PCa-specific and can dynamically monitor single-cell AR transcriptional activity before and after ARAT by bioluminescence microscopy. After biosensor transduction and bioluminescence microscopy single-cell luminescence dynamic quantification, LDA analysis could discriminate the cell populations overall ARAT sensitivity despite heterogeneous single-cell responses. Indeed, the biosensor could detect a significant decrease in AR activity following exposure to conventional ARAT in hormone-naive primary PCa cells, while in castration-resistant PCa patients, treatment response correlated with the observed clinical ARAT resistance. Conclusion: The exploitation of bioluminescence microscopy and multi-promoter transcriptionally-regulated biosensors can aptly define the overall treatment response of patients by monitoring live single cell drug response from primary cancer tissue. This approach can be used to develop predictive biomarkers for drug response in order to help clinicians select the best drug combinations or sequences for each patient.""","""['Audrey Champagne', 'Pallavi Jain', 'Lauriane Vélot', 'Julie Riopel', 'Véronique Lefebvre', 'Bertrand Neveu', 'Frédéric Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['A PCA3 gene-based transcriptional amplification system targeting primary prostate cancer.', 'PCA3 Silencing Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Enzalutamide-mediated Androgen Receptor Blockade.', 'Subgroups of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Bone Metastases Defined Through an Inverse Relationship Between Androgen Receptor Activity and Immune Response.', 'Contemporary role of prostate cancer antigen 3 in the management of prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.']"""

Quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR and in situ hybridization assays also revealed that PCAT19 was upregulated in GC tissues. The PCAT19 expression in GC was significantly related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, and pathological stage. Moreover, patients with higher PCAT19 expression levels were more likely to have a poor prognosis for overall survival. The knockdown of PCAT19 by siRNA significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of GC cells. The cell distribution of PCAT19 in GC cells was examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization assay, and the results showed that it was mainly located in the cytoplasm.

The aim of this study is to determine whether the T and B cell phenotypic features which we have previously identified as being able to distinguish between benign prostate disease and PCa in asymptomatic men having Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels < 20 ng/ml can also be used to detect the presence and clinical risk of PCa in a larger cohort of patients whose PSA levels ranged between 3 and 2617 ng/ml. The peripheral blood of 130 asymptomatic men having elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels was immune profiled using multiparametric whole blood flow cytometry. Of these men, 42 were subsequently diagnosed as having benign prostate disease and 88 as having PCa on biopsy-based evidence. We built a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Deep Neural Network (biLSTM) model for detecting the presence of PCa in men which combined the previously-identified phenotypic features (CD8+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD8+ Effector Memory cells), CD4+CD45RA-CD27-CD28- (CD4+ Effector Memory cells), CD4+CD45RA+CD27-CD28- (CD4+ Terminally Differentiated Effector Memory Cells re-expressing CD45RA), CD3-CD19+ (B cells), CD3+CD56+CD8+CD4+ (NKT cells) with Age.

The loss of Rb protein disrupts the Rb-E2F repressor complex and thus hyperactivates E2F transcription activators.

However, information for aggressive Gleason organ-confined CaP is scant. To investigate the impact of Gleason grade group (GG) 4-5 on long-term oncologic outcomes after RP.  Methods:   Within a high-volume center database we identified patients who harbored organ-confined CaP (pT2) at RP between 1992 and 2017. Only patients with negative surgical margins, without lymph node invasion and without neo- and/or adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and/or adjuvant radiotherapy were included. Patients with GG1 were excluded. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression models tested the effect of GG4 and GG5 on biochemical recurrence-free (BFS), metastasis-free (MFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM) free survival.  Results and limitations:   Of 10,855 identified pT2 patients, 0.1% (n=81) and 0.1% (n=114) harbored GG4 and GG5, respectively. At 10-years after RP, BFS, MFS, OS and CSM-free rates were 80.3 vs. 68.6 vs. 55.4% (P<0.001), 96.7 vs. 89.9. vs. 83.4% (P<0.001), 93.2 vs. 78.3 vs. 72.6% (P<0.001) and 99.3 vs. 98.0 vs. 82.7% (P<0.001) for GG2 and GG3 vs. GG4 vs. GG5, respectively. In multivariable Cox regression models, GG5 represented an independent predictor for biochemical recurrence (Hazard ratio [HR] 3.00, P<0.001), metastasis (HR 5.01, P<0.001), death (HR 2.72, P<0.01) and cancer-specific death (HR 30.1, P<0.001). Conversely, GG4 represented an independent predictor for death (HR 2.10, P=0.04) and cancer-specific death (HR 6.09, P=0.01) but not for biochemical recurrence and metastasis.  Conclusion:   GG4/5 in organ-confined CaP is rare. But its associated with worse oncologic outcomes after RP, namely biochemical recurrence, metastasis, death and cancer-specific death.

To understand the molecular mechanism(s) behind enzalutamide resistance, here, we comprehensively analyzed a range of prostate tumors and clinically relevant models by gene expression array, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot, which revealed that enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and tumors overexpress the pseudokinase, Tribbles 2 (TRIB2). Inhibition of TRIB2 decreases the viability of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells, suggesting a critical role of TRIB2 in these cells. Moreover, the overexpression of TRIB2 confers resistance in prostate cancer cells to clinically relevant doses of enzalutamide, and this resistance is lost upon inhibition of TRIB2. Interestingly, we found that TRIB2 downregulates the luminal markers androgen receptor and cytokeratin 8 in prostate cancer cells but upregulates the neuronal transcription factor BRN2 (Brain-2) and the stemness factor SOX2 (SRY-box 2) to induce neuroendocrine characteristics. Finally, we show that inhibition of either TRIB2 or its downstream targets, BRN2 or SOX2, resensitizes resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide. Thus, TRIB2 emerges as a potential new regulator of transdifferentiation that confers enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells via a mechanism involving increased cellular plasticity and lineage switching.""","""['Jitender Monga', 'Indra Adrianto', 'Craig Rogers', 'Shirish Gadgeel', 'Dhananjay Chitale', 'Joshi J Alumkal', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Amina Zoubeidi', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Daclatasvir, an Antiviral Drug, Downregulates Tribbles 2 Pseudokinase and Resensitizes Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Critical role of androgen receptor level in prostate cancer cell resistance to new generation antiandrogen enzalutamide.', 'The long noncoding RNA H19 regulates tumor plasticity in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Epiregulin expression and secretion is increased in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Patients and methods:   Patients who underwent 125I-brachytherapy for prostate cancer (cT1-cT3aN0M0) in a single institute between September 2016 and October 2018 were enrolled in the randomized, non-placebo, open-labeled, paralleled study. Patients were randomly distributed (1:1) to combination group (tamsulosin (0.2 mg/day) plus mirabegron (50 mg/day)) or tamsulosin-alone group after 125I -brachytherapy by envelope method. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in mean voided volume per micturition 3 months after 125I brachytherapy. The secondary endpoints included the changes from baseline of International Prostate Symptom Score, Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite scores and 24 hours urinary frequency after 3 months after 125I brachytherapy.  Results:   The mean changes in volume voided per micturition in the combination (n = 108) and tamsulosin-alone (n = 110) groups were -62.5 (standard deviation, ±53.8) and -68.0 (standard deviation, ±52.7), respectively (P = .17). The change in Overactive Bladder Symptom Score in combination group (P = .02) was more moderate than in tamsulosin-alone group; and 24 hour urinary frequency in combination group was lower (P = .03) than in tamsulosin-alone group.

However, the process of assessing an individual's preferences and values is challenging and not formalized. The purpose of this study is to develop an automated decision aid for patient-centric treatment decision-making using decision analysis, preference thresholds and value elicitations to maximize the compatibility between a patient's treatment expectations and outcome.  Methods:   A template for patient-centric medical decision-making was constructed. The inputs included prostate cancer risk group, pre-treatment health state, treatment alternatives (primarily focused on radiation in this model), side effects (erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, nocturia and bowel incontinence), and treatment success (5-year freedom from biochemical failure). A linear additive value function was used to combine the values for each attribute (side effects, success and the alternatives) into a value for all prospects. The patient-reported toxicity probabilities were derived from phase II and III trials. The probabilities are conditioned on the starting state for each of the side effects. Toxicity matrices for erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, nocturia and bowel incontinence were created for the treatment alternatives. Toxicity probability thresholds were obtained by identifying the patient's maximum acceptable threshold for each of the side effects. Results are represented as a visual. R and Rstudio were used to perform analyses, and R Shiny for application creation.  Results:   We developed a web-based decision aid. Based on preliminary use of the application, every treatment alternative could be the best choice for a decision maker with a particular set of preferences. This result implies that no treatment has determinist dominance over the remaining treatments and that a preference-based approach can help patients through their decision-making process, potentially affecting compliance with treatment, tolerance of side effects and satisfaction with the decision.  Conclusions:   We present a unique patient-centric prostate cancer treatment decision aid that systematically assesses and incorporates a patient's preferences and values to rank treatment options by likelihood of achieving the preferred outcome. This application enables the practice and study of personalized medicine. This model can be expanded to include additional inputs, such as genomics, as well as competing, concurrent or sequential therapies.""","""['Hilary P Bagshaw', 'Alejandro Martinez', 'Nastaran Heidari', 'David Scheinker', 'Alan Pollack', 'Radka Stoyanova', 'Eric Horwitz', 'Gerard Morton', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Mark K Buyyounouski']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""BMC Med Inform Decis Mak""","""['Providing guidance for genomics-based cancer treatment decisions: insights from stakeholder engagement for post-prostatectomy radiation therapy.', 'Integrating Patient Preference into Treatment Decisions for Men with Prostate Cancer at the Point of Care.', 'Impact of a web-based treatment decision aid for early-stage prostate cancer on shared decision-making and health outcomes: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Shared decision-making in the care of a patient with food allergy.', 'Taking shared decision making for prostate cancer to the next level: Requirements for a Dutch treatment decision aid with personalized risks on side effects.']"""

The 4MP was assayed in 1,299 sera collected preceding lung cancer diagnosis and 8,709 noncase sera.  Results:   The 4MP alone yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.82) for case sera collected within 1-year preceding diagnosis and 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.76) among the entire specimen set.

Significantly, ~50% of prostate tumours harbour a gene fusion. Inherited factors are thought to predispose to these events but, to date, only one study has investigated gene fusions in a familial context. Here, we examined the prevalence and diversity of gene fusions in 14 tumours from a single large PrCa family, PcTas9, using the TruSight® RNA Fusion Panel and Sanger sequencing validation. These fusions were then explored in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PrCa data set (n = 494). Overall, 64.3% of PcTas9 tumours harboured a gene fusion, including known erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) fusions involving ERG and ETV1, and two novel gene fusions, C19orf48:ETV4 and RYBP:FOXP1. Although 3' ETS genes were overexpressed in PcTas9 and TCGA tumour samples, 3' fusion of FOXP1 did not appear to alter its expression. In addition, PcTas9 fusion carriers were more likely to have lower-grade disease than noncarriers (p = 0.02). Likewise, TCGA tumours with high-grade disease were less likely to harbour fusions (p = 0.03). Our study further implicates an inherited predisposition to PrCa gene fusion events, which are associated with less aggressive tumours. This knowledge could lead to clinical strategies to predict men at risk for fusion-positive PrCa and, thus, identify patients who are more or less at risk of aggressive disease and/or responsive to particular therapies.""","""['Kelsie Raspin', ""Dannielle E O'Malley"", 'James R Marthick', 'Shaun Donovan', 'Roslyn C Malley', 'Annette Banks', 'Frank Redwig', 'Marketa Skala', 'Joanne L Dickinson', 'Liesel M FitzGerald']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Molecular genetic analyses of the TMPRSS2-ERG and TMPRSS2-ETV1 gene fusions in 50 cases of prostate cancer.', ""Novel 5' fusion partners of ETV1 and ETV4 in prostate cancer."", 'Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'Recurrent gene fusions in prostate cancer: their clinical implications and uses.', 'ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer.', 'DeeP4med: deep learning for P4 medicine to predict normal and cancer transcriptome in multiple human tissues.', 'CA916798 predicts poor prognosis and promotes Gefitinib resistance for lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

The expression analysis of circ_0044516, miR-330-5p, and sterile alpha and TIR motif-containing 1 (SARM1) was performed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the protein level of SARM1 was detected by western blot. The interaction between miR-330-5p and circ_0044516 or SARM1 obtained by bioinformatics prediction was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay or RNA immunoprecipitation assay.

Here, we describe our experience in primary PCa staging. Methods: We retrospectively identified 279 patients with primary PCa who underwent 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT (staging cohort). A subset of patients (83/279) subsequently underwent prostatectomy with lymph node (LN) dissection without prior treatment (efficacy cohort). The distribution of tumor lesions was determined for the staging cohort and stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk score. Involvement of pelvic LNs was assessed retrospectively by 3 masked independent central readers, and a majority rule was used for analysis. Standard surgical fields were rated on a 5-point scale independently for PET and for morphologic imaging. Results were compared with histopathologic findings on a patient, right-vs.-left, and template basis. Results: For the staging cohort, 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET was positive in 275 of 279 (98.6%), 106 of 279 (38.0%), 46 of 279 (16.5%), 65 of 279 (23.3%), and 5 of 279 (1.8%) patients for local, pelvic nodal, extrapelvic nodal, metastatic bone, and visceral metastatic disease, respectively. In the efficacy cohort, LN metastases were present in 24 of 83 patients (29%) and were located in 48 of 420 (11%) resected templates and in 33 of 166 (19.9%) hemipelvic templates in histopathology. The majority vote results showed that patient-level sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for pelvic nodal metastases were 66.7% (95% CI, 44.7%-83.6%), 96.6% (95% CI, 87.3%-99.4%), and 88.0% (95% CI, 78.5%-93.8%), respectively, for 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET and 37.5% (95% CI, 19.6%-59.2%), 91.5% (95% CI, 80.6%-96.8%), and 75.9% (95% CI, 65.0%-84.3%), respectively, for morphologic imaging. 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 showed higher interobserver agreement than morphologic imaging (patient-level Fleiss κ = 0.54 [95% CI, 0.47-0.62] vs. 0.24 [95% CI, 0.17-0.31]). A mean SUV ratio of 6.6 (95% CI, 5.2-8.1) documented a high image contrast between local tumors and adjacent low urinary tracer retention. Conclusion: 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET offers diagnostic performance superior to morphologic imaging for primary N-staging of newly diagnosed PCa, shows lower interreader variation, and offers good distinction between primary-tumor activity and bladder background activity.

In vivo PET images and ex vivo biodistribution in tumor, organs, and the injection site were assessed up to 5 h after injection. Healthy mice were monitored for up to 7 d after the last scan for signs of stress or adverse reactions. Results: After intravenous, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous radioligand administration, average residual activity at the injection site was less than 17 percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) at 1 h after injection, less than 10 %IA/g at 2 h after injection, and no more than 4 %IA/g at 4 h after injection for all radioligands.

In this context, mitochondrial Rho GTPase 2 (MIRO2) mRNA was upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer compared with localized tumors, and higher MIRO2 levels were correlated with poor patient survival. Using human cell lines that represent androgen-independent or -sensitive prostate cancer, we showed that MIRO2 depletion impaired cell growth, colony formation, and tumor growth in mice. Network analysis of MIRO2's binding partners identified metabolism and cellular responses to extracellular stimuli as top overrepresented pathways. The top hit on our screen, General Control Nonderepressible 1 (GCN1), was overexpressed in prostate cancer, and interacted with MIRO2 in prostate cancer cell lines and in primary prostate cancer cells. Functional analysis of MIRO2 mutations present in patients with prostate cancer led to the identification of MIRO2 159L, which increased GCN1 binding. Importantly, MIRO2 was necessary for efficient GCN1-mediated GCN2 kinase signaling and induction of the transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) levels. Further, MIRO2's effect on regulating prostate cancer cell growth was mediated by ATF4. Finally, levels of activated GCN2 and ATF4 were correlated with MIRO2 expression in prostate cancer xenografts. Both MIRO2 and activated GCN2 levels were higher in hypoxic areas of prostate cancer xenografts. Overall, we propose that targeting the MIRO2-GCN1 axis may be a valuable strategy to halt prostate cancer growth.  Implications:   MIRO2/GCN1/GCN2 constitute a novel mitochondrial signaling pathway that controls androgen-independent and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell growth.""","""['Madison Furnish', 'Dillon P Boulton', 'Victoria Genther', 'Denisa Grofova', 'Mitchell Lee Ellinwood', 'Lina Romero', 'M Scott Lucia', 'Scott D Cramer', 'M Cecilia Caino']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['A genetic approach to identify amino acids in Gcn1 required for Gcn2 activation.', 'Ribosome binding protein GCN1\xa0regulates the cell cycle and cell proliferation and is essential for the embryonic development of mice.', 'The amino acid sensor GCN2 suppresses terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation via La-related protein 1 (LARP1).', 'Overexpression of eukaryotic translation elongation factor 3 impairs Gcn2 protein activation.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'GCN2 eIF2 kinase promotes prostate cancer by maintaining amino acid homeostasis.', 'NMR resonance assignment of the N-terminal GTPase domain of human Miro2 Bound to GTP.', 'Miro proteins and their role in mitochondrial transfer in cancer and beyond.', 'GCN2: roles in tumour development and progression.']"""

To inform clinical practice we quantified patients' preferences for convenience, efficacy, and toxicity risks, of conventional, moderate hypofractionation, and stereotactic radiation therapy regimens.  Methods and materials:   We used a discrete choice experiment with a voluntary sample consisting of patients treated with EBRT for localized prostate cancer at our academic cancer center. In 2019, 58 participants, mean (SD) age of 72.9 (7.1) years, agreed to complete an in-person 1:1 discrete choice experiment. Each participant made 12 choices between 2 unique EBRT scenarios, each described by 5 attributes: (1) treatment time; (2) fiducial markers; and risk of (3) prostate specific antigen recurrence; (4) acute and (5) late GI or GU toxicity. Patient preferences were estimated using mixed multinomial logistic regression, and prespecified subgroups with conditional logistic regression.  Results:   All attributes were statistically significant, thus influenced participants' choices. Risks of prostate specific antigen recurrence (β = -2.581), late (β = -1.854), and acute (β = -1.005) toxicity were most important to participants (P < .001 for each), followed by EBRT length (β = -0.728; P = .017) and fiducial marker implantation (β = -0.563; P = .004). Older (β = -0.063; 95% confidence interval, -0.12, -0.01) and rural (β = -0.083; 95% CI -0.14, -0.02) participants significantly preferred shorter EBRT and were less willing-to-extend treatment to reduce toxicity risk.  Conclusions:   Patients with prostate cancer place importance on EBRT attributes, and some are willing to trade-off increased risk of toxicity for improved convenience. Our findings promote shared clinical decision-making because patients are interested in learning about the trade-offs involved.""","""['Samantha Sigurdson', 'Mark Harrison', 'Alison Pearce', 'Harriet Richardson', 'Khaled Zaza', 'Michael Brundage']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Acute genitourinary toxicity after high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy combined with hypofractionated external-beam radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer: correlation between the urethral dose in HDR brachytherapy and the severity of acute genitourinary toxicity.', 'Is moderate hypofractionation accepted as a new standard of care in north america for prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy?

We sought to analyze the representation and outcomes of older adults in trials conducted in the era of novel targeted therapy and immunotherapy.  Methods:   We searched the 2020 NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology and retrieved trials from the past 10 years leading to category 1 recommendations in the first-line metastatic setting for the 5 most common causes of cancer death. We categorized trials by cancer type, single-agent versus multiagent approach, and therapeutic class. We described the percentage of older adults (according to each trial's definition) and used a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects meta-analysis model to compare overall and progression-free survival by age.  Results:   We identified 30 trials consisting of 24,416 patients. Across all trials, 44% of enrolled patients were older adults. Representation of older adults by cancer type within trials was 49% prostate cancer, 38% pancreatic cancer, 37% breast cancer, and 34% non-small cell lung cancer. Representation of older adults also varied by therapeutic class: 20% received immunotherapy, 44% received cytotoxic chemotherapy, 54% received targeted/hormonal therapy, and 34% received combination therapy (P<.001 for all comparisons). For each year since 2010, the percentage of older adults enrolled in trials increased by 1.9%, although this difference was not significant. We observed no difference in overall or progression-free survival between older and younger adults. In our analysis of practice-changing clinical trials, we found that 44% of clinical trial participants were older adults. Trials that included immunotherapy or a combination of therapeutic classes had a lower representation of older adults (<40%).  Conclusions:   We found that >40% of patients in practice-changing trials are older adults. Although they remain underrepresented in clinical trials compared with the general population, older adults in practice-changing trials seem to be better represented than in previously reported analyses of cooperative group trials.""","""['Ronald Chow', 'Daniel E Lage', 'Grant R Williams', 'Mina S Sedrak', 'Joseph A Greer', 'Jennifer S Temel', 'Ryan D Nipp']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['First-line treatment of advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Single or combined immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Chemotherapy with cetuximab versus chemotherapy alone for chemotherapy-naive advanced non-small cell lung cancer.', 'First-line treatment of advanced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation positive non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin plus nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone as first-line treatment for metastatic non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (IMpower130): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial.', 'Temporal changes in characteristics and external validity of randomized controlled trials in older people from 2012 to 2019.', 'Long-Term Cardiovascular Mortality among 80,042 Older Patients with Bladder Cancer.']"""

As a result, USP1 was upregulated in GC samples relative to its paired normal samples. USP1 was a valuable diagnostic marker for GC, and its overexpression indicated the poor overall survival time of patients with GC. More importantly, USP1 levels were increased in GC cells and its silencing restrained the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of GC cells.

Materials and methods:   We identified 201 men treated with two forms of definitive radiotherapy for prostate cancer at two institutions: 108 men received conventionally-fractionated radiotherapy (CF-RT) and 93 received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Germline DNA was evaluated for the presence of functional mirSNPs. Random forest, boosted trees and elastic net models were developed to predict late grade ≥2 GU toxicity by the RTOG scale.  Results:   The crude incidence of late grade ≥2 GU toxicity was 16% after CF-RT and 15% after SBRT. An elastic net model based on 22 mirSNPs differentiated CF-RT patients at high risk (71.5%) versus low risk (7.5%) for toxicity, with an area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.76-0.81. An elastic net model based on 32 mirSNPs differentiated SBRT patients at high risk (64.7%) versus low risk (3.9%) for toxicity, with an area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.81-0.87. These models were specific to treatment type delivered. Prospective studies are warranted to further validate these results.  Conclusion:   Predictive models using germline mirSNPs have high accuracy for predicting late grade ≥2 GU toxicity after either CF-RT or SBRT, and are unique for each treatment, suggesting that germline predictors of late radiation sensitivity are fractionation-dependent.

It has been recently shown that ultrasound targeted microbubble cavitation (UTMC) can increase blood perfusion in skeletal muscle by triggering nitric oxide signaling. Interestingly, this effect was amplified with a sodium nitrite coinjection. Since sodium nitrite has been shown to synergize with radiotherapy (RT), we hypothesized that UTMC with a sodium nitrite coinjection could further radiosensitize solid tumors by increasing blood perfusion and thus reduce tumor hypoxia. We evaluated (1) the ability of UTMC with and without nitrite to increase perfusion in muscle (mouse hindlimbs) and human prostate tumors using different pulse lengths and pressure; (2) the efficacy of this approach as a provascular therapy given directly before RT in the human prostate subcutaneous xenografts PC3 tumor model. Using long pulses with various pressures, in muscle, the provascular response following UTMC was strong (6.61 ± 4.41-fold increase in perfusion post-treatment). In tumors, long pulses caused an increase in perfusion (2.42 ± 1.38-fold) at lower mechanical index (MI = 0.25) but not at higher MI (0.375, 0.5, and 0.750) when compared to control (no UTMC). However, when combined with RT, UTMC with long pulses (MI = 0.25) did not improve tumor growth inhibition. With short pulses, in muscle, the provascular response following UTMC (SONOS) + nitrite was strong (13.74 ± 8.60-fold increase in perfusion post-treatment). In tumors, UTMC (SONOS) + nitrite also caused a provascular response (1.94 ± 1.20-fold increase in perfusion post-treatment) that lasted for at least 10 min, but not with nitrite alone. Interestingly, the blunted provascular response observed for long pulses at higher MI without nitrite was reversed with the addition of nitrite. UTMC (SONOS) with and without nitrite caused an increase in perfusion in tumors. The provascular response observed for UTMC (SONOS) + nitrite was confirmed by histology. Finally, there was an improved growth inhibition for the 8 Gy RT dose + nitrite + UTMC group vs 8 Gy RT + nitrite alone. This effect was not significant with mice treated by UTMC + nitrite and receiving doses of 0 or 2 Gy RT.

Methods:   From July 2011 to July 2018, BC patients receiving 5.7 Gy once a week for 5 weeks to the whole breast after breast-conserving surgery were considered for the study. Inclusion criteria were: T1-T3 invasive BC, no or limited axillary involvement, age ≥ 65 years or women with commuting difficulties or disabling diseases.  Results:   A total of 271 patients were included in the study. Median age was 76 (46-86) years. Most of BC were T1 (77%), while the remaining were T2 (22.2%) and T3 (0.4%). Axillary status was negative in 68.3% of the patients. The only severe acute toxicity (G3) at the end of RT was erythema (0.4%), registered in the 3DCRT group; no G3 edema or epitheliolysis was recorded. With 18 months of median follow-up, severe early-late toxicity (G3) was reported in terms of fibrosis and breast retraction, both with an incidence of 1.4%, mostly in the 3DCRT group. Oncological outcomes at a median follow-up of 2.9 years reported 249/271 (91.9%) patients alive and free from any event and 5 (1.8%) isolated locoregional recurrences. At 3 years, disease-free survival and overall survival were 94.9% and 97.8%, respectively. Breast volume > 500 cm3 was reported as predictive for moderate-severe (≥ G2) acute toxicity.

Methods:   Between October 2020 and August 2021, 41 patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for staging of PCa were retrospectively analyzed. Volumetric and radiomics data were obtained from early and late PSMA PET images. The differences between age, metastasis status, PSA, standard uptake value (SUV), volumetric and radiomics parameters between GG groups were analyzed. Early and late PET radiomic models were created, area under curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy values of the models were obtained. In addition, the correlation of Dmax values with total PSMA-tumor volume (TV), Total lesion (TL)-PSMA and PSA values was evaluated. In metastatic patients, the difference in Dmax between GG groups was analyzed.  Results:   There was a significant difference between patients with GG ≤ 3 and > 3 in 35 of the early PET radiomic features. In the early PET model, multivariate analyses showed that GLRLM_RLNU and PSA were the most meaningful parameters.

While inflammation is a cancer hallmark, the underlying mechanisms mediating inflammation-induced PCa are still under investigation. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is an inflammatory cytokine that promotes cancer progression, including PCa metastasis and castration resistance. We previously found that acute IL-1 exposure represses PCa androgen receptor (AR) expression concomitant with the upregulation of pro-survival proteins, causing de novo accumulation of castration-resistant PCa cells. However, acute inflammation is primarily anti-tumorigenic, while chronic inflammation is pro-tumorigenic. Thus, using the LNCaP PCa cell line as model, we found that PCa cells can evolve insensitivity to chronic IL-1 exposure, restoring AR and AR activity and acquiring castration resistance. In this paper we expanded our chronic IL-1 model to include the MDA-PCa-2b PCa cell line to investigate the response to acute versus chronic IL-1 exposure and to compare the gene expression patterns that evolve in the LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cells chronically exposed to IL-1.  Methods:   We chronically exposed MDA-PCa-2b cells to IL-1α or IL-1β for several months to establish sublines. Once established, we determined subline sensitivity to exogenous IL-1 using cell viability assay, RT-qPCR and western blot. RNA sequencing was performed for parental and subline cells and over representation analysis (ORA) for geneset enrichment of biological process/pathway was performed.  Results:   MDA-PCa-2b cells repress AR and AR activity in response to acute IL-1 exposure and evolve insensitivity to chronic IL-1 exposure. While cell biological and molecular response to acute IL-1 signaling is primarily conserved in LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cells, including upregulation of NF-κB signaling and downregulation of cell proliferation, the LNCaP and MDA-PCa-2b cells evolve conserved and unique molecular responses to chronic IL-1 signaling that may promote or support tumor progression.  Conclusions:   Our chronic IL-1 subline models can be used to identify underlying molecular mechanisms that mediate IL-1-induced PCa progression.""","""['Shayna E Thomas-Jardin', 'Mohammed S Kanchwala', 'Haley Dahl', 'Vivian Liu', 'Rohan Ahuja', 'Reshma Soundharrajan', 'Nicole Roos', 'Sydney Diep', 'Amrit Sandhu', 'Chao Xing', 'Nikki A Delk']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""J Cell Signal""","""['RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'Chronic IL-1 exposure drives LNCaP cells to evolve androgen and AR independence.', 'Identification of an IL-1-induced gene expression pattern in AR+ PCa cells that mimics the molecular phenotype of AR- PCa cells.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'NF-κB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.']"""

This receptor is also a stress-induced scaffold protein that helps cells to cope with oxidative stress through activation of the Nrf2 pathway. Functional disorders of p62 are closely associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases and cancers. The gene encoding the E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate-binding adapter SPOP is frequently mutated in prostate cancer (PCa), but the molecular mechanisms underlying how SPOP mutations contribute to PCa tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. Here, we report that cytoplasmic SPOP binds and induces the non-degradative ubiquitination of p62 at residue K420 within the UBA domain. This protein modification decreases p62 puncta formation, liquid phase condensation, dimerization, and ubiquitin-binding capacity, thereby suppressing p62-dependent autophagy. Moreover, we show that SPOP relieves p62-mediated Keap1 sequestration, which ultimately decreases Nrf2-mediated transcriptional activation of antioxidant genes. We further show that PCa-associated SPOP mutants lose the capacity to ubiquitinate p62 and instead promote autophagy and the redox response in a dominant-negative manner. Thus, our findings indicate oncogenic roles of autophagy and Nrf2 activation in the tumorigenesis of SPOP-mutated PCa.""","""['Qing Shi#', 'Xiaofeng Jin#', 'Pingzhao Zhang#', 'Qian Li#', 'Zeheng Lv', 'Yan Ding', 'Huiying He', 'Yijun Wang', 'Yuanlong He', 'Xiaying Zhao', 'Shi-Min Zhao', 'Yao Li', 'Kun Gao', 'Chenji Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Differ""","""['Enhanced autophagy and NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway activation in SPOP mutation-driven prostate cancer.', 'Enhanced autophagy and NFE2L2/NRF2 pathway activation in SPOP mutation-driven prostate cancer.', 'Negative Regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 Pathway by a p62/Sqstm1 Splicing Variant.', 'NBR1-mediated p62-liquid droplets enhance the Keap1-Nrf2 system.', 'Histone H3F3/H3.3 chaperone DAXX converts to modulate SQSTM1 phase condensation for NFE2L2 activation.', 'p62 at the interface of autophagy, oxidative stress signaling, and cancer.', 'Effect of Lacking ZKSCAN3 on Autophagy, Lysosomal Biogenesis and Senescence.', 'Identification of bicalutamide resistance-related genes and prognosis prediction in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Git1-PGK1 interaction achieves self-protection against spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury by modulating Keap1/Nrf2 signaling.', 'Enhanced liquidity of p62 droplets mediated by Smurf1 links Nrf2 activation and autophagy.', 'Epigenetic and post-translational modifications in autophagy: biological functions and therapeutic targets.']"""

Methods We reviewed the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and selected patients with localized PanNETs diagnosed between 1973 and 2015. We divided the patients into two groups according to the presence or absence of prior non-pancreatic malignancy. Before and after propensity score matching, we compared the clinicopathological characteristics and studied the overall survival and cancer-specific survival. Results A total of 357 (12.9%) of 2778 patients with localized PanNETs had prior cancer. A total of 1211 cases with only a localized PanNET and 133 cases with a localized PanNET and prior cancer had complete data and met the inclusion criteria of the current study. Patients with prior cancer were associated with advanced age (>65 years, 57.9% prior cancer vs. 31.0% no prior cancer, P<0.001), later year of diagnosis (87.2% vs. 80.2%, P=0.049), a higher proportion of poorly differentiated/undifferentiated grade tumors (4.5% vs. 1.5%, P=0.025), and a higher proportion of no primary site surgery (19.5% vs. 10.4%, P=0.003). Prostate (29.32%), breast (18.05%), other genitourinary and retroperitoneal (16.54%), and gastrointestinal (12.78%) cancers were the most common prior cancer types. Most of the prior cancers (95.49%) were localized and regional, and only 4.51% of the prior cancers were distant. Patients with interval periods between the prior cancer and PanNET of ≤36 months, 36-60 months, 60-120 months, and >120 months accounted for 33.08%, 13.53%, 24.06%, and 29.32% of all cases with prior cancers, respectively. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed. The presence/absence of prior cancers did not impact survival outcomes of patients with localized PanNETs before and after propensity score matching (PSM). Further subgroups analysis showed that, patients with localized PanNETs and prior distant cancer had worse cancer-specific survival than patients with prior local/regional cancer or patients without prior cancer (P<0.001). No significant differences in cancer-specific survival were observed in terms of the different sites of the prior cancers and the different interval periods of prior cancers and PanNETs (P<0.05). Conclusions Patients with localized PanNETs and a history of prior cancer had survival outcomes that were comparable to those of patients with no history of prior cancer. Patients with localized PanNETs and prior cancer could be candidates for clinical trials if they satisfy all other conditions; aggressive and potentially curative therapies should be offered to these patients.""","""['Liang Wang', 'Gang Li', 'Yun-Tao Bing', 'Mao-Lin Tian', 'Hang-Yan Wang', 'Chun-Hui Yuan', 'Dian-Rong Xiu']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Chin Med Sci J""","""['Impact of a Prior Nonpancreatic Malignancy on Survival Outcomes of Patients With Stage IV Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor: A Population-Based and Propensity Score Matching Study.', 'Surgery Versus Surveillance for Well-Differentiated, Nonfunctional Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors: An 11-Year Analysis of the National Cancer Database.', 'The high-grade (WHO G3) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor category is morphologically and biologically heterogenous and includes both well differentiated and poorly differentiated neoplasms.', 'Pre- and intraoperative diagnostic requirements, benefits and risks of minimally invasive and robotic surgery for neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas.', 'Neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors: guidelines for management and update.']"""

However, the potential molecular mechanism of circRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) remains largely unknown.  Methods:   Differentially expressed circRNAs were identified by RNA sequencing. The expression of hsa_circ_0003258 was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR and RNA in situ hybridization. The impacts of hsa_circ_0003258 on the metastasis of PCa cells were investigated by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. Lastly, the underlying mechanism of hsa_circ_0003258 was revealed by Western blot, biotin-labeled RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase assays and rescue experiments.  Results:   Increased expression of hsa_circ_0003258 was found in PCa tissues and was associated with advanced TNM stage and ISUP grade. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0003258 promoted PCa cell migration by inducing epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT) in vitro as well as tumor metastasis in vivo, while knockdown of hsa_circ_0003258 exerts the opposite effect. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_0003258 could elevate the expression of Rho GTPase activating protein 5 (ARHGAP5) via sponging miR-653-5p. In addition, hsa_circ_0003258 physically binds to insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) in the cytoplasm and enhanced HDAC4 mRNA stability, in which it activates ERK signalling pathway, then triggers EMT programming and finally accelerates the metastasis of PCa.  Conclusions:   Upregulation of hsa_circ_0003258 drives tumor progression through both hsa_circ_0003258/miR-653-5p/ARHGAP5 axis and hsa_circ_0003258/IGF2BP3 /HDAC4 axis.

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine elevated in PCa patients promotes neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). In this study, PCa cells were differentiated with IL-6 in in-vitro to identify novel targets or signaling pathways associated with emergence of NEPC on deprivation of androgens. From the results, we observed an activation of TGF-β signaling pathway is altered through multiple proteins in differentiated LNCaP cells. Hence, we investigated the role of TGF-β axis in PCa cells differentiation. LNCaP cells treated with IL-6 in androgens deprived media release excess TGF-β ligand and this as conditioned media added to cells stimulated NED of PCa cells. TGF-β released by IL-6 stimulated cells activate p38MAPK through SMAD2 thereby promote NED. Inhibition of TGF-βRI and TGF-βRII signaling activation in LNCaP cells treated with IL-6 did not reversed the NED of cells, possibly due to the reason that the inhibition of TGF-β axis is further activating p38MAPK through SMAD independent manner in PCa cells. However, siRNA mediated knock down or inhibition p38MAPK inactivated TGF-β - SMAD axis in differentiating cells and attenuated NED of LNCaP cells. This result suggests that p38MAPK is the central node for receiving IL-6 signals and promotes NED of LNCaP cells in androgens free media. Remarkably, downregulation or inhibition of p38MAPK in NCI-H660 reversed NED characteristics as well as markers along with inactivation of SMAD2 whereas no effect observed in WPMY-1 normal prostate cells. Taken together these findings unveil that p38MAPK and its upstream regulators are potential targets to overcome the progression of NED of PCa and develop novel therapeutic measures along ADT for effective treatment of PCa.""","""['Sirisha Natani', 'K K Sruthi', 'Sakkarai Mohamed Asha', 'Priyanka Khilar', 'Pampana Sandhya Venkata Lakshmi', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['AMPK/SIRT1 signaling through p38MAPK mediates Interleukin-6 induced neuroendocrine differentiation of LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'MicroRNA-147b induces neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells by targeting ribosomal protein RPS15A.', 'Autophagy pathway is required for IL-6 induced neuroendocrine differentiation and chemoresistance of prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'TGF-beta signal transduction in corneal wound healing as a therapeutic target.', 'Prognostic effect of neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: A critical review.', 'Therapy-associated remodeling of pancreatic cancer revealed by single-cell spatial transcriptomics and optimal transport analysis.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.', 'Focus on the tumor microenvironment: A seedbed for neuroendocrine prostate cancer.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients were selected from an ongoing prospective institutional trial investigating the use of [18F]DCFPyL PSMA PET and CT in recurrent prostate cancer (NCT02899312). This report included patients who underwent BT (either monotherapy or boost) and experienced a biochemical failure (BF) defined by the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] > 2 ng/mL above nadir).  Results:   Between March 2017 and April 2020, 670 patients underwent [18F]DCFPyL PSMA PET and CT imaging. Of these 670 patients, 93 were treated with BT; 73 underwent monotherapy, and 20 underwent BT boost (19 low-dose rate and 1 high-dose rate). To report on patterns of recurrence outcomes, 86 patients (median prescan PSA 6.0) with a positive [18F]DCFPyL PSMA PET and CT scan and true BF were included. The most common location of relapse was local; 62.8% had a component of local failure (defined as prostate and/or seminal vesicles), and 46.5% had isolated local failure only, with no other sites of involvement. Regional failure occurred in 40.7% of patients, and 36.0% had metastatic failure. Isolated local recurrence was seen in 54.3% of monotherapy patients versus only in 12.5% of boost patients. Metastatic failure was seen in 28.6% of monotherapy patients versus 68.8% of the boost patients. Local recurrences (69.0%) were found within the same prostate biopsy sextant involved with the tumor at diagnosis, and 76.0% of patients with seminal vesicle recurrences had prostate-base involvement at diagnosis.

Development of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) requires androgen-independent activation of AR, which involves its large N-terminal domain (NTD) and entails extensive epigenetic changes depending in part on histone lysine demethylases (KDMs) that interact with AR. The AR-NTD is rich in low-complexity sequences, including a polyQ repeat. Longer polyQ sequences were reported to decrease transcriptional activity and to protect against prostate cancer, although they can lead to muscular atrophy. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these observations are unclear. Using NMR spectroscopy, here we identify weak interactions between the AR-NTD and the KDM4A catalytic domain, and between the AR ligand-binding domain and a central KDM4A region that also contains low-complexity sequences. We also show that the AR-NTD can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro, with longer polyQ sequences phase separating more readily. Moreover, longer polyQ sequences hinder nuclear localization in the absence of hormone and increase the propensity for formation of AR-containing puncta in the nucleus of cells treated with dihydrotestosterone. These results lead us to hypothesize that polyQ-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation may provide a mechanism to decrease the transcriptional activity of AR, potentially opening new opportunities to design effective therapies against CRPC and muscular atrophy.""","""['Carlos M Roggero', 'Victoria Esser', 'Lingling Duan', 'Allyson M Rice', 'Shihong Ma', 'Ganesh V Raj', 'Michael K Rosen', 'Zhi-Ping Liu', 'Josep Rizo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['The N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor drives its nuclear localization in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanism of androgen receptor corepression by CKβBP2/CRIF1, a multifunctional transcription factor coregulator expressed in prostate cancer.', 'Interplay between Cytoplasmic and Nuclear Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Mediates Castration Resistance.', 'Phase-separation: a possible new layer for transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor.', 'A Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation-Related Index Associate with Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Immune Environment of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'The evolution and polymorphism of mono-amino acid repeats in androgen receptor and their regulatory role in health and disease.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and spatial chromatin organization in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) represents an excellent target for molecular imaging. IAB2M, an 85-kD minibody derived from a de-immunized monoclonal antibody directed at the extracellular domain of human PSMA (huJ591), and PSMA-11, a small molecule ligand have been previously tested as probes for visualization of recurrent/metastatic PCa with PET/CT. This pilot, non-randomized trial studied their diagnostic utility in patients (pts) with localized PCa.  Methods:   Pts planned for radical prostatectomy (RP) were enrolled and underwent mpMRI and PET/CT imaging with 89 Zr-df-IAB2M and/or 68 Ga-PSMA-PET/CT. Image results were read by a radiologist blinded to clinical information and pathology results, mapped and compared to corresponding histopathology findings from all lesions, both clinically significant and nonsignificant. The detection rates of all three imaging modalities were measured and correlated.  Results:   20 pts with median age of 64.5 (46-79) years and PSA level of 7.5 (1.6-36.56) ng/ml were enrolled. 19 pts underwent RP and were imaged pre-operatively with 89 Zr-Df-IAB2M PET/CT and mpMRI. Nine of those were imaged using 68 Ga-PSMA-11 as well. Out of 48 intraprostatic lesions verified on surgical pathology, IAB2M PET/CT was able to detect 36 (75%). A similar proportion of pathologically confirmed, clinically significant lesions (22/29, 76%) was detected. IAB2M PET/CT was also able to identify 14/19 (74%) extraprostatic lesions. The performance of mpMRI was inferior, with 24/48 detectable lesions (50%) and 18/29 clinically significant intraprostatic lesions (62%). Compared to the current standard (mpMRI), IAB2M PET/CT had a sensitivity of 88%, specificity 38%, positive predictive value 58%, and accuracy 63%. In 9 pts who underwent Ga-PSMA-11 as well, the latter yielded a detection rate of 70% (14/20), which was also seen in clinically significant lesions (10/14, 71%). Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT also detected 4/6 (67%) extraprostatic lesions.  Conclusions:   In this pilot study, the performance of 89 Zr-df-IAB2M was superior to mpMRI and similar to 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.

The authors performed a randomized controlled trial of an online intervention supporting couples' posttreatment recovery of sexual intimacy.  Methods:   Patients treated with surgery, radiation, or combined radiation and androgen deprivation therapy who had partners were recruited and randomized to an online intervention or a control group. The intervention, tailored to treatment type and sexual orientation, comprised 6 modules addressing expectations for sexual and emotional sequelae of treatment, rehabilitation, and guidance toward sexual intimacy recovery. Couples, recruited from 6 sites nationally, completed validated measures at the baseline and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Primary outcome group differences were assessed with t tests for individual outcomes.  Results:   Among 142 randomized couples, 105 patients (mostly surgery) and 87 partners completed the 6-month survey; this reflected challenges with recruitment and attrition. There were no differences between the intervention and control arms in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Satisfaction With Sex Life scores 6 months after treatment (the primary outcome). Three months after treatment, intervention patients and partners reported more engagement in penetrative and nonpenetrative sexual activities than controls. More than 73% of the intervention participants reported high or moderate satisfaction with module content; more than 85% would recommend the intervention to other couples.  Conclusions:   Online psychosexual support for couples can help couples to connect and experience sexual pleasure early after treatment despite patients' sexual dysfunction. Participants' high endorsement of the intervention reflects the importance of sexual health support to couples after prostate cancer treatment.  Lay summary:   This study tested a web-based program supporting couples' sexual recovery of sexual intimacy after prostate cancer treatment. One hundred forty-two couples were recruited and randomly assigned to the program (n = 60) or to a control group (n = 82). The program did not result in improvements in participants' satisfaction with their sex life 6 months after treatment, but couples in the intervention group engaged in sexual activity sooner after treatment than couples in the control group.

However, how ectopic FGFR1 contributes to PCa progression is not well understood. In our study we showed that ablation of FGFR1 in DU145 human PCa cells changed the cell metabolite profile. Among the changes, the choline metabolism profile was the most significantly altered by FGFR1 ablation. Detailed characterization revealed that ablation of FGFR1 altered expression of multiple choline metabolism enzymes. Among the changes of FGFR1-regulated choline metabolic enzymes, downregulation of choline kinase α (CHKA) is the most prominent changes, which phosphorylates free choline to phosphocholine. Ablation of FGFR1 blunted the activity of choline to promote cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, depletion of CHKA compromised FGF signaling activity in DU145 cells. We also first time demonstrated that FGFR1 formed complex with CHKA, suggesting that FGFR1 regulated CHKA at the posttranslational level. Together with the previous report that ectopic FGFR1 contributes to PCa progression and metastasis, our results here unravel a novel mechanism by which FGFR1 promotes PCa progression by dysregulating choline metabolism, and that the crosstalk between FGFR1-choline metabolism can be a potential target for managing PCa progression.""","""['Zhichao Fan', 'Jisheng Ma', 'Xuebo Pan', 'Liangcai Zhao', 'Yuying Wu', 'Hui Lin', 'Yidan Zhao', 'Haowei Jiang', 'Tingting Pan', 'Xiaokun Li', 'Fen Wang', 'Cong Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Ectopic fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 promotes inflammation by promoting nuclear factor-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Aberrant FGFR Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Enhances the Warburg Effect by Reprogramming LDH Isoform Expression and Activity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 Drives the Metastatic Progression of Prostate Cancer.', 'Intrinsic FGFR2 and Ectopic FGFR1 Signaling in the Prostate and Prostate Cancer.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.', 'MALAT1 as a Regulator of the Androgen-Dependent Choline Kinase A Gene in the Metabolic Rewiring of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Objective:   To investigate differences in outcomes with first-line abiraterone therapy between African American and non-Hispanic White men with mCRPC in a national real-world cohort.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used a nationwide electronic health record-derived database of 3808 men receiving first-line therapy for mCRPC between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2018. Data analysis was performed between January 1, 2020, and June 1, 2021. Median follow-up was 13 months (IQR, 7-22 months). Propensity score-based inverse probability of treatment weighting was applied to reduce imbalance in measured confounders between patients receiving first-line abiraterone vs other first-line therapies. Deidentified patient data originated from a geographically diverse set of approximately 280 cancer clinics (approximately 800 sites of care) throughout the United States. Participants had newly diagnosed mCRPC and were receiving first-line systemic therapy during the study period.  Exposures:   Receipt of abiraterone for first-line therapy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival from start of first-line treatment. Stratified analyses investigated overall survival within each race group, with first-line enzalutamide as the comparator.  Results:   Among 3808 patients with mCRPC, there were 2615 non-Hispanic White men (68.7%; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 74 [8] years) and 404 African American men (10.6%; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 69 [9] years), and 1729 patients (45.4%) in the cohort received first-line abiraterone. Among patients receiving first-line abiraterone, African American men had higher median overall survival than non-Hispanic White men (23 months [IQR, 10-37 months] vs 17 months [IQR, 9-32 months], respectively; inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98). A race-by-treatment interaction existed for first-line abiraterone vs first-line enzalutamide (hazard ratio for abiraterone vs enzalutamide: non-Hispanic White men, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.06-1.38]; African American men, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.74-1.50]; interaction P = .02). There was no overall survival difference between first-line abiraterone and first-line enzalutamide among African American patients (24 vs 24 months, respectively; inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74-1.50). First-line abiraterone was associated with decreased median overall survival relative to first-line enzalutamide among non-Hispanic White patients (17 months [IQR, 9-32 months] vs 20 months [IQR, 10-36 months], respectively; inverse probability of treatment weighting hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.38).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study of patients who received first-line systemic therapy for mCRPC, African American men who received abiraterone had improved overall survival compared with non-Hispanic White men.

To achieve the goals of precise medicine, novel SP94 peptide-modified and doxorubicin-loaded ultrasonic NDs (SP94-DOX-NDs) for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) targeting and treatment were constructed in this study. The characteristics, contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging (CEUI), targeting ability to glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78)-overexpressing CRPC and anticancer effect of the SP94-DOX-NDs were assessed. The desired SP94-NDs were successfully prepared using the nanoemulsification method using a certain proportion of SP94-PEG-chitosan, perfluoropentane (PFP), Tween 20, and lecithin. SP94-NDs with a size of ∼300 nm showed great biocompatibility and CEUI ability. Compared with blank NDs, SP94-NDs exhibited higher tumor-specific targeting ability due to conjugation between the SP94 peptide and GRP78-overexpressing 22RV1 cells. Most importantly, in vitro and in vivo investigations showed that SP94-DOX-NDs combined with ultrasound could specifically deliver DOX into 22RV1 cells and thereby demonstrated a stronger anticancer effect than DOX-NDs and DOX. Thus, SP94-DOX-NDs may provide an efficient approach for the real-time imaging of tumors and triggered, accurate drug delivery to tumors.""","""['Yading Zhao', 'Dandan Shi', 'Mengmeng Shang', 'Xiao Sun', 'Lu Guo', 'Dong Meng', 'Xinxin Liu', 'Xiaoying Zhou', 'Jie Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Drug Deliv""","""['Utilizing RNA nanotechnology to construct negatively charged and ultrasound-responsive nanodroplets for targeted delivery of siRNA.', 'Multifunctional liposome for photoacoustic/ultrasound imaging-guided chemo/photothermal retinoblastoma therapy.', 'Bypassing multidrug resistant ovarian cancer using ultrasound responsive doxorubicin/curcumin co-deliver alginate nanodroplets.', 'Combination prostate cancer therapy: Prostate-specific membranes antigen targeted, pH-sensitive nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin and tanshinone.', 'Current progress of nanomedicine for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment.', 'Targeting prostate cancer with docetaxel-loaded peptide 563-conjugated PEtOx-co-PEI30%-b-PCL polymeric micelle nanocarriers.', 'New progresses on cell surface protein HSPA5/BiP/GRP78 in cancers and COVID-19.', 'Cell surface GRP78: a potential mechanism of therapeutic resistant tumors.', 'Multifunctional nanoparticle for cancer therapy.', 'Potential to Eradicate Cancer Stemness by Targeting Cell Surface GRP78.']"""

Methods:   We separately analyzed clinical data of PCa patients with bone oligometastases enrolled in a prospective phase I trial (DESTROY-2). DESTROY-2 was based on SRS delivered using volumetric modulated arc therapy in patients with primary or metastatic tumors in several extra-cranial body sites. Acute and late toxicity, biochemical tumor response, local control (LC), distant metastases-free (DPFS), progression-free (PFS), time to next-line systemic treatment-free (NEST-FS), and overall survival (OS) were calculated.  Results:   Data on 37 PCa patients, carrying out 50 bone metastases, candidates for curative-intent treatment and treated with SRS at our Institution were collected. SRS dose ranged between 12 and 24 Gy. One grade 1 acute skin toxicity in one patient treated on the hip (24 Gy) and one grade 1 late skin toxicity in a patient with a scapular lesion (24 Gy) were recorded. No cases of bone fracture were registered in the treated population. With a median follow-up of 25 months (range 3-72 months) 2-year actuarial LC, DPFS, PFS, and OS were 96.7%, 58.1%, 58.1%, and 95.8%, respectively. Median and 2-year NEST-FS were 30 months (range 1-69 months) and 51.2%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Data analysis showed few toxicity events, high local control rate and prolonged NEST-FS after linear accelerator-based radiosurgery of bone oligometastases from PCa.

For men in an intimate relationship, these symptoms disrupt couples' relationships and intimacy. The symptoms also reduce quality of life for both men and their partners, who are often their primary caregivers. Management of the negative effects of cancer and its treatment is a significantly under-addressed supportive care need for these men and their intimate partners. To address these unmet supportive care needs, our interdisciplinary team developed and pilot tested the usability and feasibility of an evidence-based, couple-focused, tailored eHealth intervention, ""Prostate Cancer Education & Resources for Couples"" (PERC). Based on the adapted stress and coping theoretical framework and developed with stakeholder involvement, PERC aims to improve quality of life for both men and their partners by enhancing their positive appraisals, self-efficacy, social support, and healthy behaviors for symptom management.  Methods:   We will test the efficacy of PERC using a population-based, geographically and demographically diverse cohort in a randomized controlled trial. Primary aim: Assess if patients and partners receiving PERC will report greater improvement in their cancer-related quality of life scores than those in the control group (usual care plus the National Cancer Institute prostate cancer website) at 4, 8, and 12 months post-baseline. Secondary aim: Test if patients and partners in PERC will report significantly more positive appraisals and higher levels of coping resources at follow-ups than those in the control group. Exploratory aim: Determine if patient race and ethnicity, education, type of treatment, or couples' relationship quality moderate the effects of PERC on patient and partner QOL at follow-ups.  Discussion:   This study will provide a novel model for self-managing chronic illness symptoms that impact couples' relationships, intimacy, and quality of life.

Acupuncture is considered an effective treatment for post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI), but the evidence is still limited. We propose to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in a rigorously conducted trial.  Methods:   Twenty hospitals will recruit 340 participants with urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy in China from April 2021 to April 2022. Participants will be randomly allocated to acupuncture or sham acupuncture with a 1:1 ratio using computerized simple random sampling. The study plan consists of 1-week baseline, 6-week treatment, and 18-week follow-up. Eighteen 30-min sessions of acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatment will be provided between weeks 1 and 6. The primary outcome is the change in the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI-SF) score at the week 6 from the baseline. Secondary outcomes include the change in volume of urine leakage at weeks 4 and 6 from a baseline measured using the 1-h pad test; 72-h incontinence episode frequency based on a 72-h voiding diary; change in the Expanded prostate cancer Index Composite scale (EPIC-26); change in the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale; weekly consumption of pads; and the severity of urinary incontinence based on a 72-h bladder diary and self-assessment of the therapeutic effect. The safety of acupuncture will also be assessed.  Discussion:   This trial will help to identify whether acupuncture is effective for PPI, and, if so, whether it exerts a therapeutic rather than a placebo effect.

To analyze the AR signaling pathway, we exogenously introduced the AR gene via a retrovirus into immortalized dermal papilla cells and comprehensively compared their expression profiles with and without AR expression.  Results:   Whole-transcriptome profiling revealed that the focal adhesion pathway was mainly affected by the activation of AR signaling.

Identifying lncRNA-disease associations (LDAs) will contribute to diagnose, treatment, and prognosis of diseases. However, the identification of LDAs by the biological experiments is time-consuming, costly and inefficient. Therefore, the development of efficient and high-accuracy computational methods for predicting LDAs is of great significance.  Results:   In this paper, we propose a novel computational method (gGATLDA) to predict LDAs based on graph-level graph attention network. Firstly, we extract the enclosing subgraphs of each lncRNA-disease pair. Secondly, we construct the feature vectors by integrating lncRNA similarity and disease similarity as node attributes in subgraphs. Finally, we train a graph neural network (GNN) model by feeding the subgraphs and feature vectors to it, and use the trained GNN model to predict lncRNA-disease potential association scores. The experimental results show that our method can achieve higher area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision recall curve (AUPR), accuracy and F1-Score than the state-of-the-art methods in five fold cross-validation. Case studies show that our method can effectively identify lncRNAs associated with breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and renal cancer.

Case: We report a 62-year-old African American male with past medical history of hyperlipidemia, prostate cancer, hypertension, bilateral carpal tunnel surgery that had debuted with a cardiac arrhythmia at age 55 and was diagnosed with heart failure several years later. Restrictive cardiomyopathy was suspected, and genetic screening was sent for ATTRm which confirmed a pathogenic trasnthyretin gene mutation.

SD-208-encapsulated EXOs (SD-208/EXOs) and R848-encapsulated EXOs (R848/EXOs) were successfully prepared with a size of 87 ± 8 nm and 51 ± 4 nm, respectively, which were stable in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. SD-208/EXOs and R848/EXOs reduced the migration of cancer cells (B16F10 and PC-3) and triggered the release of proinflammatory cytokines from stimulated macrophages and dendritic cells, respectively. The fluorescent dye-labeled EXOs showed significantly improved penetration through the PC-3/fibroblast co-culture spheroids and enhanced accumulation in the B16F10 mouse tumor model compared with the free fluorescent dye. In addition, the combination therapy of R848/EXOs (R848 dose of 0.36 mg/kg) and SD-208/EXOs (SD-208 dose of 0.75 mg/kg) reduced tumor growth and improved survival rate at low doses in the B16F10 tumor xenograft model. Taken together, the combination therapy using the TGFβRI kinase inhibitor and TLR 7/8 agonist with EXOs may serve as a promising strategy to treat melanoma and prostate cancer. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Owing to the prevalence of several non-responding cancers that resist treatment, it is necessary to identify a novel combined treatment strategy with biomaterials to maximize therapeutic efficacy and minimize the undesirable side effects. In this study, we aimed to examine the use of the TGFβRI kinase inhibitor SD-208 and the TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) encapsulated within serum-derived EXOs for their synergistic antitumor effects. We first demonstrated that combined treatment with SD-208 and R848 can be a convincing strategy to circumvent tumor growth in vivo using serum-derived exosomes as promising carriers. Therefore, we believe this manuscript would be of great interest to the biomaterial communities especially who are studying immunotherapy.""","""['Joo Hang Lee', 'Jihyeon Song', 'In Gyu Kim', 'Gayeon You', 'Han Kim', 'Joong-Hoon Ahn', 'Hyejung Mok']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist R848 alters the immune tumor microenvironment and enhances SBRT-induced antitumor efficacy in murine models of pancreatic cancer.', 'Dual-Functional PLGA Nanoparticles Co-Loaded with Indocyanine Green and Resiquimod for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Dual activation of Toll-like receptors 7 and 9 impairs the efficacy of antitumor vaccines in murine models of metastatic breast cancer.', 'Trial Watch: experimental TLR7/TLR8 agonists for oncological indications.', 'Exosomes as smart drug delivery vehicles for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Heterotypic tumor spheroids: a platform for nanomedicine evaluation.', 'Recent Progress in Extracellular Vesicle-Based Carriers for Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy.', 'Exosomes in Cardiovascular Disease: From Mechanism to Therapeutic Target.', 'Macrophage-derived exosomes modulate wear particle-induced osteolysis via miR-3470b targeting TAB3/NF-κB signaling.', 'Extracellular Vesicles-Based Cell-Cell Communication in Melanoma: New Perspectives in Diagnostics and Therapy.']"""

Methods:   The 50 prostate tissues including 25 PCa tissues and 25 BPH samples were collected for analyzing the expression levels of target circRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).  Results:   The results revealed that expression of circCDR1AS was significantly elevated in PCa compared with the BPH (p < 0.05). We also observed that PCa patients over the age of 60 had a higher expression of the circCDR1AS than patients under the age of 60 (p = 0.017). Moreover, a lower expression level of circHIAT1 was found in the PCa than BPH tissues (p < 0.05), and finally, the findings indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) of circCDR1AS was 0.848, with 92% sensitivity and 76% specificity, as well as an AUC of 0.828, with the 80% sensitivity and 76% specificity for circHIAT1.

In vitro three-dimensional cell culture has gained immense interest in cancer research and drug discovery programs as it yields important physiological information and serves an excellent model for bioimaging and penetration analysis studies. Current techniques employed in spheroid formation include liquid overlay and hanging drop methods, both of which are low-yielding and technically demanding. We describe for the first time a simple-to-use platform, μSpherePlatform, an inexpensive, high-throughput method yielding morphologically homogeneous spheroids in bulk for analyzing penetrative capacity and imaging ability of PCa diagnostics. Microwell arrays made of agarose have been fabricated using a commercial hairbrush as a master template. This procedure has been described in detail, and arrays of spheroids (100-120 spheroids/6-well plate) with >95% success rates have been produced from PCa cell lines (LNCaP and DU-145). A PSMA-targeted fluorescent conjugate was synthesized and evaluated in the spheroids developed using μSpherePlatform by multiphoton imaging. A synthetic 3D scaffold strategy is reported herein, which (1) correlates perfectly with the in vivo model, (2) is amenable for automated analysis, (3) shows a negligible lot to lot variation, (4) is simplistic, (5) is useful for high-throughput assays, (6) is extremely compatible with imaging techniques, (7) generates PCa spheroids within 48 h, and (8) forms large size-controllable spheroids of diameter 500-1300 μm.

CAPE enhanced the level of ionizing radiation (IR)-induced gamma H2AX foci and cell death by apoptosis. The combination treatment also decreased the migration potential of PCa cells. This was confirmed by increased expression of E-cadherin and decrease in vimentin expression. CAPE sensitized PCa cells to radiation in vitro and induced apoptosis, augmented phosphorylation of Akt/mTOR, and hampered cell migration. At the mechanistic level, co-treatment of CAPE and IR inhibited cell growth by decreasing RAD50 and RAD51 proteins involved in DNA repair. This resulted in enhanced DNA damage and cell death.

Methods:   Family physicians were surveyed as part of the 2020 Council of Academic Family Medicine Educational Research Alliance (CERA) survey. We used χ2 to compare physicians' knowledge and screening practices stratified by physician age, gender, and percentage of Black patients in patient panel. We calculated logistic regressions predicting shared decision-making conversations, barriers to shared decision-making, inclusion of race in prostate cancer screening approach, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing adjusted for physician age, gender, and percentage of Black patients.  Results:   Physicians reported engaging in shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening in half of eligible men.

Methods:   We conducted a register-based study including all men aged 50-85 years diagnosed with prostate cancer in Denmark from 1998 to 2015 and an age-matched cancer-free comparison cohort. We calculated the number of new and total prescriptions from three years before to three years after the date of diagnosis of the case for selected drug classes divided by the number of person-months and stratified by stage at diagnosis.  Results:   We included 54,286 prostate cancer patients and 249,645 matched comparisons. 30,712 patients were diagnosed with localized disease and 12,884 with non-localized disease. The rates of new prescriptions increased considerably among patients within the year before the diagnosis. Hereafter the rates varied between drug classes. For most drug classes, total prescription rates for patients and comparisons increased similarly in the study period. Total prescription rates varied between men with localized and non-localized disease for all drug classes apart from statins.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that a large proportion of prostate cancer cases are likely diagnosed during medical work-up for other reasons than prostate cancer. Increased rates occur within the last year before diagnosis and future studies on the interaction between drug use and prostate cancer should at least include a one year pre-diagnostic lag-time. Post-diagnostic prescription rates demonstrated an increased use of drugs most likely associated with the consequences of the disease.""","""['Signe Benzon Larsen', 'Christian Dehlendorff', 'Charlotte Skriver', 'Anton Pottegård', 'Søren Friis', 'Martin Andreas Røder', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Anne Katrine Duun-Henriksen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Prescription rates for drugs used in treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction before and after prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Exposure to statins post localized prostate cancer diagnosis and risk of metastasis among men who did not receive curative prostate cancer treatment.', 'Drug prescription for erectile dysfunction before and after diagnosis of localized prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Common medications and prostate cancer mortality: a review.']"""

New molecular targets are needed to define and impede the growth and progression of advanced prostate cancers. Claudins (Cldns) are transmembrane proteins that regulate paracellular permeability and cell polarity, and their levels are elevated in many human cancers such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostatic cancers. Previously, we found that Cldn3 and Cldn4 are expressed in aggressive high-grade human prostate cancer specimens. We and others have shown that there are higher levels of Cldn3 and Cldn4 in metastatic human prostate cancer cells than in normal human prostate cells. The result of targeting Cldn3 and Cldn4 expression on the growth and viability of prostate cancer cells has not been elucidated. Human prostate cancer PC3 and LNCaP cells were transfected with Cldn3 or -4 small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Cldn3/Cldn4 siRNA treatment resulted in a greater than 85% decrease in the protein levels of Cldn3 and Cldn4, which was accompanied by a 30-40% decrease in prostate cancer cell growth and a 60-65% reduction in cell viability. There was decreased cell migration with Cldn3 and Cldn4 siRNA in both PC3 and LNCaP cells and a 60-75% decrease in the number of clones when treated with siCldn3 or siCldn4 compared to control.

We provide evidence to support that the hypoxic milieu of tumors may limit the clinical usefulness of YM155. Hypoxia (1% O2) strongly (>16-fold) represses the cytotoxic activity of YM155 on prostate and renal cancer cells in vitro. Hypoxia also represses all early signaling responses associated with YM155, including activation of AMPK and retinoblastoma protein (Rb), inactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), inhibition of phospho-ribosomal protein S6 (rS6), and suppression of the expression of Cyclin Ds, Mcl-1 and Survivin. Cells pre-incubated with hypoxia for 24 ​h are desensitized to YM155 even when they are treated with YM155 under atmospheric oxygen conditions, supporting that cells at least temporarily retain hypoxia-induced resistance to YM155. We tested the role of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α and HIF-2α in the hypoxia-induced resistance to YM155 by comparing responses of YM155 in VHL-proficient versus VHL-deficient RCC4 and 786-O renal cancer cells and silencing HIF expression in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Those studies suggested that hypoxia-induced resistance to YM155 occurs independent of HIF-1α and HIF-2α. Moreover, the hypoxia mimetics deferoxamine and dimethyloxalylglycine, which robustly induce HIF-1α levels in PC-3 ​cells under atmospheric oxygen, did not diminish their early cellular responses to YM155. Collectively, our data support that hypoxia induces resistance of cells to YM155 through a HIF-1α and HIF-2α-independent mechanism.

Methods:   The relationship between PCAT14 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of prostate cancer was analyzed based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the value of PCAT14 as a diagnostic marker for prostate cancer. The relationship between PCAT14 and immune cell infiltration was analyzed to explore the effect of PCAT14 on the immune-related functions of prostate cancer.  Results:   The ROC curve showed that PCAT14 had a significant diagnostic ability (area under curve = 0.818) for prostate cancer. A reduced expression of PCAT14 in prostate cancer was related to T stage, N stage, primary therapy outcome, residual tumor, Gleason score, and age. The expression of PCAT14 was independently associated with the progression-free interval in prostate cancer patients. The infiltration of immune cells in prostate cancer showed a significant negative correlation between the expression of PCAT14 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, activated dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, and neutrophils.

One of the main problems of follow up in patients with this type of cancer, is the need for thyroglobulin stimulation, not to mention the poor availability of 123I or 124I, to perform studies with a higher degree of sensitivity. Prostatic Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET/CT has demonstrated to be quite useful in a diversified number of neoplasms, on behalf of its capacity of evaluating the extent of type II carboxypeptidase expression in vascular endothelium. The end point of this article is to assess whether this novel image method possesses applicability in thyroid neoplasms follow up, for diagnostic and potentially therapeutic purposes.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated well differentiated metastatic thyroid cancer patients, who underwent a post therapeutic 131I dose whole body scan (WBS) and complementary SPECT/CT, as well as 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.  Results:   Ten patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were included, of whom 80% were women and 20% men, mean age was 58 years old (± 11.6). Sixty-four metastatic lesions were analyzed, 67.19% had papillary histology and 32.81% were follicular type, the most affected site of metastases was bone in 57.81%, followed by lung 17.19%, lymph nodes 7.81%, postoperative thyroid bed 4.69%, brain 4.69% and others 7.81%. 68Ga PSMA-11 PET/CT detected 64/64 lesions, all of them also identified by computed tomography (CT), whereas 131I SPECT/CT detected 55/64 lesions. Discrepant lesions were localized in lung 44.4%, brain 22.2%, postoperative thyroid bed 11.1%, lymph nodes 11.1% and bone 11.1%. The degree of correspondence among observers was outstanding for both radiotracers, but close upon perfect for PSMA-11 (κ = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.80 - 0.91), as opposed to 131 I (κ = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.71 - 0.76).  Conclusions: 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed an utterly superior capability for metastatic lesion detection when compared to 131I SPECT/CT.

Methods:   The algorithm, combining model-based and deep learning-based approaches, was trained for zonal segmentation using the NCI-ISBI-2013 dataset and 70 T2-weighted datasets acquired at an academic centre. Test datasets were randomly selected among examinations performed at this centre on one of two scanners (General Electric, 1.5 T; Philips, 3 T) not used for training. Automated segmentations were corrected by two independent radiologists. When segmentation was initiated outside the prostate, images were cropped and segmentation repeated. Factors influencing the algorithm's mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and its precision were assessed using beta regression.  Results:   Eighty-two test datasets were selected; one was excluded. In 13/81 datasets, segmentation started outside the prostate, but zonal segmentation was possible after image cropping. Depending on the radiologist chosen as reference, algorithm's median DSCs were 96.4/97.4%, 91.8/93.0% and 79.9/89.6% for whole-gland, central gland and anterior fibromuscular stroma (AFMS) segmentations, respectively. DSCs comparing radiologists' delineations were 95.8%, 93.6% and 81.7%, respectively. For all segmentation tasks, the scanner used for imaging significantly influenced the mean DSC and its precision, and the mean DSC was significantly lower in cases with initial segmentation outside the prostate. For central gland segmentation, the mean DSC was also significantly lower in larger prostates. The radiologist chosen as reference had no significant impact, except for AFMS segmentation.  Conclusions:   The algorithm performance fell within the range of inter-reader variability but remained significantly impacted by the scanner used for imaging.  Key points:   • Median Dice similarity coefficients obtained by the algorithm fell within human inter-reader variability for the three segmentation tasks (whole gland, central gland, anterior fibromuscular stroma). • The scanner used for imaging significantly impacted the performance of the automated segmentation for the three segmentation tasks. • The performance of the automated segmentation of the anterior fibromuscular stroma was highly variable across patients and showed also high variability across the two radiologists.""","""['Olivier Rouvière', 'Paul Cezar Moldovan', 'Anna Vlachomitrou', 'Sylvain Gouttard', 'Benjamin Riche', 'Alexandra Groth', 'Mark Rabotnikov', 'Alain Ruffion', 'Marc Colombel', 'Sébastien Crouzet', 'Juergen Weese', 'Muriel Rabilloud']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'Deep Learning Whole-Gland and Zonal Prostate Segmentation on a Public MRI Dataset.', 'Spatially varying accuracy and reproducibility of prostate segmentation in magnetic resonance images using manual and semiautomated methods.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Benchmarking of deep learning algorithms for 3D instance segmentation of confocal image datasets.', 'Development and clinical utility analysis of a prostate zonal segmentation model on T2-weighted imaging: a multicenter study.']"""

We also used the National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA) database for the same purposes among men diagnosed with prostate cancer in England. Next, we used multivariable regression to estimate the adjusted risk ratio (aRR) of receiving radical local treatment for men with non-metastatic prostate cancer according to the country of diagnosis (US vs. England). The five-tiered Cambridge Prognostic Group (CPG) classification was included as an interaction term.  Results:   We identified 109,697 patients from the SEER database, and 74,393 patients from the NPCA database, who were newly diagnosed with non-metastatic prostate cancer between April 1st 2014 and December 31st 2016 with sufficient information for risk stratification according to the CPG classification.

Though routinely used in clinical practice, there are no data exploring the reliability of genomic data obtained from spine metastases samples often leading to multiple biopsies in clinical practice. This study compares the genomic tumor landscape between spinal metastases and the corresponding primary tumors as well as between spinal metastases and visceral metastases.  Methods:   Spine tumor samples, obtained for routine clinical care from 2013 to 2019, were analyzed using MSK-IMPACT, a next-generation sequencing assay. These samples were matched to primary or metastatic tumors from the corresponding patients. A concordance rate for genomic alterations was calculated for matching sample pairs within patients for the primary and spinal metastatic tumor samples as well as for the matching sample pairs within patients for the spinal and visceral metastases. For a more robust and clinically relevant estimate of concordance, subgroup analyses of previously established driver mutations specific to the main primary tumor histologies were performed.  Results:   Eighty-four patients contributed next-generation sequencing data from a spinal metastasis and at least one other site of disease: 54 from the primary tumor, 39 had genomic tumor data from another, nonspinal metastasis, 12 patients participated in both subsets. For the cohort of matched primary tumors and spinal metastases (n = 54) comprised of mixed histologies, we found an average concordance rate of 96.97% for all genetic events, 97.17% for mutations, 100% for fusions, 89.81% for deletions, and 97.01% for amplifications across all matched samples. Notably, >25% of patients harbored at least one genetic variant between samples tested, though not specifically for known driver mutations. The average concordance rate of driver mutations was 96.99% for prostate cancer, 95.69% (P = .0004513) for lung cancer, and 96.43% for breast cancer. An average concordance of 99.02% was calculated for all genetic events between spine metastases and non-spinal metastases (n = 41) and, more specifically, a concordance rate of 98.91% was calculated between spine metastases and liver metastases (n = 12) which was the largest represented group of nonspine metastases.  Conclusion:   Sequencing data performed on spine tumor samples demonstrate a high concordance rate for genetic alterations between the primary tumor and spinal metastasis as well as between spinal metastases and other, visceral metastases, particularly for driver mutations. Spine tumor samples may be reliably used for genomic-based decision making in cancer care, particularly for prostate, NSCLC, and breast cancer.""","""['Ori Barzilai', 'Axel Martin', 'Anne S Reiner', 'Ilya Laufer', 'Adam Schmitt', 'Mark H Bilsky']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Neuro Oncol""","""['Comparative genomic analysis of primary tumors and metastases in breast cancer.', 'Comparative Genomic Profiling of Matched Primary and Metastatic Tumors in Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Next-generation sequencing reveals high concordance of recurrent somatic alterations between primary tumor and metastases from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'Insights into the metastatic cascade through research autopsies.']"""

The purpose of the study was to assess radiation safety concerns and compare data with patients having normal renal function. Sixty-two liters of dialysate in 22 samples were collected over 4 mo. The mean surface dose rate of the dialysate bags was 0.16 μSv h-1 (range 0.11-0.23 μSv h-1). The highest measured removable surface activity was 150 dpm per 100 cm2.

It typically presents as a late-stage incurable cancer and chemotherapy provides modest benefit. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility, safety, and potency of a novel human natural killer (NK) cell-based immunotherapy to treat PC.  Methods:   The expression of prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) was evaluated in primary PC at messenger RNA and protein levels. The processes of retroviral transduction, expansion, activation, and cryopreservation of primary human NK cells obtained from umbilical cord blood were optimized, allowing us to develop frozen, off-the-shelf, allogeneic PSCA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) NK cells. The safety and efficacy of PSCA CAR NK cells also expressing soluble (s) interleukin 15 (PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells) were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   PSCA was elevated in primary human PC compared with the adjacent or other normal tissues. PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells displayed significant tumor-suppressive effects against PSCA(+) PC in vitro before and after 1 cycle of freeze-thaw. The viability of frozen PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells persisted more than 90 days in vivo after their last infusion and significantly prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with human PC.  Conclusions:   PSCA CAR_s15 NK cells showed therapeutic efficacy in human metastatic PC models without signs of systematic toxicity, providing a strong rationale to support clinical development.""","""['Kun-Yu Teng', 'Anthony G Mansour', 'Zheng Zhu', 'Zhiyao Li', 'Lei Tian', 'Shoubao Ma', 'Bo Xu', 'Ting Lu', 'Hanyu Chen', 'David Hou', 'Jianying Zhang', 'Saul J Priceman', 'Michael A Caligiuri', 'Jianhua Yu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Gastroenterology""","""['DAP12-based activating chimeric antigen receptor for NK cell tumor immunotherapy.', 'Anti-PSMA CAR-engineered NK-92 Cells: An Off-the-shelf Cell Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical Assessment of Suitable Natural Killer Cell Sources for Chimeric Antigen Receptor Natural Killer-Based ""Off-the-Shelf"" Acute Myeloid Leukemia Immunotherapies.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) natural killer (NK)-cell therapy: leveraging the power of innate immunity.', 'CAR-NK Cells: From Natural Basis to Design for Kill.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor engineered natural killer cells for cancer therapy.', 'Understanding NK cell biology for harnessing NK cell therapies: targeting cancer and beyond.', 'Epigenetic regulation in the tumor microenvironment: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'Advancements in CAR-NK therapy: lessons to be learned from CAR-T therapy.', 'The Notch signaling pathway: a potential target for cancer immunotherapy.']"""

In this study, the antiandrogenic effects of FMN were investigated in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells. FMN inhibited dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced protein expression of androgen receptor in 22Rv1cells. In another prostate cancer LNCaP cells, FMN decreased the protein level of DHT-induced prostate specific antigen (PSA). In addition, FMN downregulated DHT-induced mRNA expression of androgen regulated genes in both cell lines, showing less prominent inhibition in 22Rv1cells where androgen receptor had been significantly decreased by FMN. FMN was found to bind androgen receptor, demonstrating that it acted as a competitive androgen receptor antagonist. FMN increased the phosphorylation of Akt in 22Rv1 cells and this increment was abrogated by PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, resulting in a rescued androgen receptor protein level which was decreased by FMN. Additionally, FMN was found to increase the mRNA and protein level of E3 ligase mouse double minute 2. Our data suggest that the androgen receptor signaling is regulated through PI3K-Akt-MDM2 pathway in 22Rv1 cells. Together, our results indicate that FMN facilitated the degradation of androgen receptor in 22Rv1 cells and inhibited the expression of androgen regulated genes by competing the binding of DHT to androgen receptor in LNCaP cells, demonstrating its therapeutic potential as an antiandrogen.""","""['Yun-Ho Choi', 'Jaeyoon Kim', 'Jae Young Shin', 'Nae-Gyu Kang', 'Sanghwa Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Pharmacol""","""['Changes in androgen receptor nongenotropic signaling correlate with transition of LNCaP cells to androgen independence.', 'Comparison of prostate cancer cell lines for androgen receptor-mediated reporter gene assays.', 'Interruption of nuclear factor kappaB signaling by the androgen receptor facilitates 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbolacetate-induced apoptosis in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells.', 'A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Antiandrogenic mechanisms of pesticides in human LNCaP prostate and H295R adrenocortical carcinoma cells.', 'The effect of semen cuscutae flavonoid on Sertoli cells and blood-testis barrier in male infertility: integrating network pharmacology and experimental verification.']"""

PSMA-617 is one of the most promising ligands that bind to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), the cell surface biomarker of CRPC. Of the radiolabeled PSMA ligands developed to date, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 is most commonly used for PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) prior to radioligand therapy (RLT) with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. However, the presence of 68Ga radioactivity (half-life 68 m) in urine at the early PET imaging time point complicates optimization of the therapeutic dose of PSMA-617 labeled with 177Lu (half-life 6.7 d). Thus, PET imaging with the long-lived positron emitter 89Zr (half-life 3.3 d) would be better suited in order to optimize the dose of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 as 89Zr PET allows scans after excretion of the radioactive urine. Until now, PSMA-617 could not be radiolabeled with 89Zr with high radiochemical yield due to poor incorporation of 89Zr into 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA). Here we report a novel method for radiolabeling PSMA-617 with 89Zr and the preliminary results of small-animal PET with [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617.  Methods:   We labeled PSMA-617 with 89Zr in a 1:1 mixture of DMSO and HEPES buffer at 90 °C for 30 min, followed by quality control analysis by HPLC. We then determined the dissociation constant (Kd) and logD values of [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617. We obtained PET images of [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 at 24 h in mice bearing both LNCaP (PSMA-positive) and PC-3 (PSMA-negative) tumors (N = 5). The ex vivo [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 biodistribution was then examined separately using tissue samples of LNCaP-bearing mice at 2 h (N = 4) and 24 h (N = 4).  Results:   [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 was prepared with a radiochemical yield of 70 ± 9%. The Kd value was 6.8 ± 3.5 nM. The logD value was -4.05 ± 0.20. PET images showed the highest uptake in LNCaP tumors (maximum standardized uptake value, SUVmax = 0.98 ± 0.32) and low uptake in kidneys (SUVmax = 0.18 ± 0.7) due to the absence of urine radioactivity.  Conclusion:   [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 was successfully prepared using DMSO and HEPES buffer. [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 visualized PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors in the absence of radioactive urine 24 h p.i.  Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care:   This method of radiolabeling PSMA-617 with 89Zr using DMSO would be suitable for future clinical trials.

Methods and materials:   918 consecutive patients who underwent prostate MRI followed by MRI/US fusion biopsy and systematic biopsies from January 2015 to November 2019 at a single academic medical center were retrospectively identified. The outcome was upgrade of PCa by systematic biopsy, defined as cases when systematic biopsy led to a Gleason Grade (GG) ≥ 2 and greater than the maximum GG detected by targeted biopsy. Generalized linear regression and conditional logistic regression were used to analyze predictors of upgrade.  Results:   At the gland level, the presence of an US-visible lesion was associated with decreased upgrade (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.93, p = 0.02). At the sextant level, upgrade was more likely to occur through the biopsy of sextants with MRI-visible lesions (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.87-3.63, p < 0.001), US-visible lesions (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.14-2.93, p = 0.01), and ipsilateral lesions (OR 3.89, 95% CI 2.36-6.42, p < 0.001).

However, DWI acquired with echo-planar imaging is susceptible to distortions due to static magnetic field inhomogeneities. This study aimed to estimate spatial displacements of bone and to examine whether distortion corrected DWI images more accurately reflect underlying anatomy. Whole-body MRI data from 127 prostate cancer patients were analyzed. The reverse polarity gradient (RPG) technique was applied to DWI data to estimate voxel-level distortions and to produce a distortion corrected DWI dataset. First, an anatomic landmark analysis was conducted, in which corresponding vertebral landmarks on DWI and anatomic T2-weighted images were annotated. Changes in distance between DWI- and T2-defined landmarks (i.e., changes in error) after distortion correction were calculated. In secondary analyses, distortion estimates from RPG were used to assess spatial displacements of bone metastases. Lastly, changes in mutual information between DWI and T2-weighted images of bone metastases after distortion correction were calculated. Distortion correction reduced anatomic error of vertebral DWI up to 29 mm. Error reductions were consistent across subjects (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 10-20). On average (± SD), participants' largest error reduction was 11.8 mm (± 3.6). Mean (95% CI) displacement of bone lesions was 6.0 mm (95% CI 5.0-7.2); maximum displacement was 17.1 mm. Corrected diffusion images were more similar to structural MRI, as evidenced by consistent increases in mutual information (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < 10-12).

Multivariable logistic regression analyses (LRM) aimed to predict improvement of EORTC QoL. Mean preoperative QoL values did not significantly differ between CAPRA-S low- (LR) vs. high-risk (HR, 75.7 vs. 75.2; p = 0.7) and pentafecta vs. non-pentafecta groups (75.6 vs. 75.2; p = 0.6).

In LRM, CAPRA-S and pentafecta criteria were independent predictors of improved QoL.

First, the data were retrieved from TCGA dataset, and valid samples were obtained by consistent clustering and principal component analysis; next, key genes were analyzed for prognosis of PCa using WGCNA, MEGENA, and LASSO Cox regression model analysis, while key genes were screened based on disease-free survival significance. Finally, TIMER data were selected to explore the relationship between genes and tumor immune infiltration, and GSCAlite was used to explore the small-molecule targeted drugs that act with them. Here, we used tumor subtype analysis and an energetic co-expression network algorithm of WGCNA and MEGENA to identify a signal dominated by the ROMO1 to predict PCa prognosis. Cox regression analysis of ROMO1 was an independent influence, and the prognostic value of this biomarker was validated in the training set, the validated data itself, and external data, respectively. This biomarker correlates with tumor immune infiltration and has a high degree of infiltration, poor prognosis, and strong correlation with CD8+T cells.

Methods:   In total, 305,072 participants (53% [161,383] women) of UK Biobank were included in this study (2007-2010). Self-reported diagnosis of osteoporosis at baseline was the exposure of interest. The outcomes were CVD, respiratory disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), all cancer, and prostate and breast cancer incidence and mortality and all-cause mortality.

Polyhydroxyalkanoate granule-binding protein (PhaP), a natural biomacromolecule symbiotic with PHBHHx, can be steadily adsorbed into the PHBHHx matrix through hydrophobic interactions. In this study, PHBHHx nanoparticles (NPs) and iRGD peptide fused PhaP (iRGD-PhaP) were used in conjunction to build a specific drug delivery system for targeted accumulation and tissue penetration in prostate tumors. A proper presentation and high surface density of iRGD could be ensured within 1 h through a convenient coincubation method using a PhaP-mediated modification strategy. iRGD-PhaP-NPs showed a satisfactory particle size (182.9 ± 4.9 nm) and slightly negative surface charge (-17.2 ± 0.3 mV), with a uniformly spherical shape. In human prostate cancer cell line PC3, iRGD-PhaP-NPs displayed remarkably improved cellular uptake compared to naked NPs, which was attributed to iRGD receptor-mediated active endocytosis. Enhanced targeted accumulation and retention of iRGD-PhaP-NPs in prostate tumors were found in both the ex vivo tumor spheroid assay and in vivo real-time imaging. Moreover, slices of the tumor deep region demonstrated the favorable tumor penetration ability of iRGD-PhaP-NPs after intravenous administration.

However, the beam angle optimization (BAO) problem is difficult to solve to optimality due to its non-convex discrete nature with many local minima. In this study, we propose TBS-BAO, a novel approach for solving the BAO problem, and test it for non-coplanar robotic CyberKnife radiotherapy for prostate cancer. First, an ideal Pareto-optimal reference dose distribution is automatically generated usinga priorimulti-criterial fluence map optimization (FMO) to generate a plan that includes all candidate beams (total-beam-space, TBS). Then, this ideal dose distribution is reproduced as closely as possible in a subsequent segmentation/beam angle optimization step (SEG/BAO), while limiting the number of allowed beams to a user-selectable preset value. SEG/BAO aims at a close reproduction of the ideal dose distribution. For each of 33 prostate SBRT patients, 18 treatment plans with different pre-set numbers of allowed beams were automatically generated with the proposed TBS-BAO. For each patient, the TBS-BAO plans were then compared to a plan that was automatically generated with an alternative BAO method (Erasmus-iCycle) and to a high-quality manually generated plan. TBS-BAO was able to automatically generate plans with clinically feasible numbers of beams (∼25), with a quality highly similar to corresponding 91-beam ideal reference plans. Compared to the alternative Erasmus-iCycle BAO approach, similar plan quality was obtained for 25-beam segmented plans, while computation times were reduced from 10.7 hours to 4.8/1.5 hours, depending on the applied pencil-beam resolution in TBS-BAO. 25-beam TBS-BAO plans had similar quality as manually generated plans with on average 48 beams, while delivery times reduced from 22.3 to 18.4/18.1 min.

We aimed to better understand relationships between trends in PSA testing, prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Australia and factors that influence them.  Methods:   We calculated and described standardised time trends in PSA tests, prostate biopsies, treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and prostate cancer incidence and mortality in Australia in men aged 45-74, 75-84, and 85 + years.  Results:   PSA testing increased from its introduction in 1989 to a peak in 2008 before declining in men aged 45-84 years. Prostate biopsies and cancer incidence fell from 1995 to 2000 in parallel with decrease in trans-urethral resections of the prostate (TURP) and, latterly, changes in pharmaceutical management of BPH. After 2000, changes in biopsies and incidence paralleled changes in PSA screening in men 45-84 years, while in men ≥85 years biopsy rates stabilised, and incidence fell. Prostate cancer mortality in men aged 45-74 years remained low throughout. Mortality in men 75-84 years gradually increased until mid 1990s, then gradually decreased. Mortality in men ≥ 85 years increased until mid 1990s, then stabilised.  Conclusion:   Age specific prostate cancer incidence largely mirrors PSA testing rates. Most deviation from this pattern may be explained by less use of TURP in management of BPH and consequent less incidental cancer detection in TURP tissue specimens. Mortality from prostate cancer initially rose and then fell below what it was when PSA testing began. Its initial rise and fall may be explained by a possible initial tendency to over-attribute deaths of uncertain cause in older men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer to prostate cancer. Decreases in mortality rates were many fold smaller than the increases in incidence, suggesting substantial overdiagnosis of prostate cancer after introduction of PSA testing.""","""['Thanya Pathirana', 'Rehan Sequeira', 'Chris Del Mar', 'James A Dickinson', 'Bruce K Armstrong', 'Katy J L Bell', 'Paul Glasziou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""['Opportunistic testing versus organized prostate-specific antigen screening: outcome after 18 years in the Göteborg randomized population-based prostate cancer screening trial.', 'Prostate cancer and prostate-specific antigen testing in New South Wales.', 'Changes in prostate specific antigen (PSA) ""screening"" patterns by geographic region and socio-economic status in Australia: Analysis of medicare data in 50-69 year old men.', 'Incidental carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Clinical efficacy of prostate PI-RADS V2.1 score combined with serum PSA-related indicators in the detection of gray zone prostate cancer.', 'Fictitious cases as a methodology to discuss sensitive health topics in focus groups.', 'Risk Evaluation of Bone Metastases and a Simple Tool for Detecting Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'The most effective but largely ignored target for prostate cancer early detection and intervention.', 'The Cellular and Molecular Immunotherapy in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   In a monocentric retrospective study patients with skull base metastases and cranial nerve deficits who received treatment between 2006 and 2018 were analyzed concerning clinical characteristics at initial diagnosis, treatment and course of the disease.  Results:   In this study 45 patients with skull base metastases and cranial nerve deficits were included. The most frequent primary tumors were prostate cancer (27%), breast cancer (22%) and multiple myeloma (16%). The most involved cranial nerves were trigeminal nerve (42%), oculomomotor nerve (33%) and facial nerve (27%). Of the patients 84% had additional bone metastases outside the skull base. Dural infiltration or meningeal carcinomatosis were each observed in 13% of the patients. After radiotherapy cranial nerve deficits remained stable in 61% of all cases and in 22% symptoms improved. Median overall survival from treatment was 8 months (range 0.4-51 months). Patients with dose-escalated radiotherapy appeared to live longer (16.4 months vs. 4.7 months). This effect persisted in a multivariate analysis including the Karnofsky index, number of metastases, primary tumor and radiation dose (HR 0.37, p = 0.02).

Objectives:   To compare the 2021 USPSTF lung cancer screening criteria with other lung cancer screening criteria and evaluate whether the sensitivity and specificity of these criteria differ by race.  Design, setting, and participants:   This study included 912 patients with lung cancer and 1457 controls without lung cancer enrolled in an epidemiology study (INHALE [Inflammation, Health, Ancestry, and Lung Epidemiology]) in the Detroit metropolitan area between May 15, 2012, and March 31, 2018. Patients with lung cancer and controls were 21 to 89 years of age; patients with lung cancer who were never smokers and controls who were never smokers were not included in these analyses. Statistical analysis was performed from August 31, 2020, to April 13, 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   The study assessed whether patients with lung cancer and controls would have qualified for lung cancer screening using the 2013 USPSTF, 2021 USPSTF, and 2012 modification of the model from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCOm2012) screening criteria. Sensitivity was defined as the percentage of patients with lung cancer who qualified for screening, while specificity was defined as the percentage of controls who did not qualify for lung cancer screening.  Results:   Participants included 912 patients with a lung cancer diagnosis (493 women [54%]; mean [SD] age, 63.7 [9.5] years) and 1457 control participants without lung cancer at enrollment (795 women [55%]; mean [SD] age, 60.4 [9.6] years). With the use of 2021 USPSTF criteria, 590 patients with lung cancer (65%) were eligible for screening compared with 619 patients (68%) per the PLCOm2012 criteria and 445 patients (49%) per the 2013 USPSTF criteria. With the use of 2013 USPSTF criteria, significantly more White patients than African American patients with lung cancer (324 of 625 [52%] vs 121 of 287 [42%]) would have been eligible for screening. This racial disparity was absent when using 2021 USPSTF criteria (408 of 625 [65%] White patients vs 182 of 287 [63%] African American patients) and PLCOm2012 criteria (427 of 625 [68%] White patients vs 192 of 287 [67%] African American patients). The 2013 USPSTF criteria excluded 950 control participants (65%), while the PLCOm2012 criteria excluded 843 control participants (58%), and the 2021 USPSTF criteria excluded 709 control participants (49%).

Methods:   This retrospective study included 142 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed PCa who were undergoing mp-MRI before surgery. MRI images were scored and evaluated by two independent radiologists using PI-RADS V2.1. The radiomics workflow was divided into five steps: (a) image selection and segmentation, (b) feature extraction, (c) feature selection, (d) model establishment, and (e) model evaluation. Three machine learning algorithms (random forest tree (RF), logistic regression, and support vector machine (SVM)) were constructed to differentiate high-grade from low-grade PCa. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the machine learning-based analysis of bp-MRI radiomics models with PI-RADS V2.1.  Results:   In all, 8 stable radiomics features out of 804 extracted features based on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and ADC sequences were selected. Radiomics signatures successfully categorized high-grade and low-grade PCa cases (P < 0.05) in both the training and test datasets. The radiomics model-based RF method (area under the curve, AUC: 0.982; 0.918), logistic regression (AUC: 0.886; 0.886), and SVM (AUC: 0.943; 0.913) in both the training and test cohorts had better diagnostic performance than PI-RADS V2.1 (AUC: 0.767; 0.813) when predicting PCa grade.  Conclusions:   The results of this clinical study indicate that machine learning-based analysis of bp-MRI radiomic models may be helpful for distinguishing high-grade and low-grade PCa that outperformed the PI-RADS V2.1 scores based on mp-MRI. The machine learning algorithm RF model was slightly better.""","""['Li Zhang', 'Xia Zhe', 'Min Tang', 'Jing Zhang', 'Jialiang Ren', 'Xiaoling Zhang', 'Longchao Li']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Contrast Media Mol Imaging""","""['Radiomics vs radiologist in prostate cancer.

Recently, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted great attention in prostate cancer treatment because of its high accuracy and no trauma. However, the hypoxic microenvironment of the tumor severely reduces the therapeutic efficacy of oxygen-dependent PDT in prostate cancer, which hampers the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, the PDT process induces the overexpression of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby reducing the efficacy of PDT. This study proposed a novel multifunctional nanosystem for the targeted delivery of indocyanine green (ICG), 2,2'-azobis[2-(2-imidazolinI-2-yl) propane] dihydrochloride (AIBI), and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor geldanamycin (17-AAG). Under near-infrared light irradiation, the photothermal effect of ICG induces AIBI decomposition and releases oxygen-independent free radicals, which rescues the hindered ICG-mediated ROS generation. Moreover, 17-AAG reduces heat resistance by inhibiting Hsp90, thereby achieving mild hyperthermia. Simultaneously, the inhibition of Hsp90 can inhibit the overexpression of its client proteins such as anti-apoptotic proteins (survivin) and androgen receptor (AR), thereby improving the efficacy of PDT and inducing prostate cancer cell apoptosis. Results show that the nanosystem enhances PDT by combining free radicals and 17-AAG, exhibiting a good anticancer effect on prostate cancer cells but less toxicity on normal cells.""","""['Qinyan Sun', 'Fengyu Liu', 'Zhenfu Wen', 'Jing Xia', 'Hongjuan Li', 'Yongqian Xu', 'Shiguo Sun']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Mater Chem B""","""['Overcoming photodynamic resistance and tumor targeting dual-therapy mediated by indocyanine green conjugated gold nanospheres.', 'Treatment of triple negative breast cancer by near infrared light triggered mild-temperature photothermal therapy combined with oxygen-independent cytotoxic free radicals.', 'HSP90 Inhibitor Encapsulated Photo-Theranostic Nanoparticles for Synergistic Combination Cancer Therapy.', 'Spotlight on 17-AAG as an Hsp90 inhibitor for molecular targeted cancer treatment.', 'Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin and its derivatives as novel cancer chemotherapeutic agents.', 'Research Progress of Nanomedicine-Based Mild Photothermal Therapy in Tumor.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.', 'Photodynamic Therapy-Adjunctive Therapy in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We analyzed clinical and genomic data from prostate cancer patients with metastatic disease and known metastatic sites from publicly available targeted sequencing data.  Results:   Prostate cancer metastasis to the liver versus other sites of metastasis conferred a high hazard for death in patients with metastatic prostate cancer (HR: 3.96, 95% CI: 2.4-6.5, p < 0.0001).

Chromatin remodeling is critical for the cancer stem cell (CSC) state; however, there is no definitive evidence that MUC1-C regulates chromatin accessibility and thereby expression of stemness-associated genes. We demonstrate that MUC1-C drives global changes in chromatin architecture in the dedifferentiation of CRPC and TNBC cells. Our results show that MUC1-C induces differentially accessible regions (DAR) across their genomes, which are significantly associated with differentially expressed genes (DEG). Motif and cistrome analysis further demonstrated MUC1-C-induced DARs align with genes regulated by the JUN/AP-1 family of transcription factors. MUC1-C activates the BAF chromatin remodeling complex, which is recruited by JUN in enhancer selection. In studies of the NOTCH1 gene, which is required for CRPC and TNBC cell self-renewal, we demonstrate that MUC1-C is necessary for (i) occupancy of JUN and ARID1A/BAF, (ii) increases in H3K27ac and H3K4me3 signals, and (iii) opening of chromatin accessibility on a proximal enhancer-like signature. Studies of the EGR1 and LY6E stemness-associated genes further demonstrate that MUC1-C-induced JUN/ARID1A complexes regulate chromatin accessibility on proximal and distal enhancer-like signatures. These findings uncover a role for MUC1-C in chromatin remodeling that is mediated at least in part by JUN/AP-1 and ARID1A/BAF in association with driving the CSC state.  Implications:   These findings show that MUC1-C, which is necessary for the CRPC and TNBC CSC state, activates a novel pathway involving JUN/AP-1 and ARID1A/BAF that regulates chromatin accessibility of stemness-associated gene enhancers.""","""['Atrayee Bhattacharya', 'Atsushi Fushimi', 'Nami Yamashita', 'Masayuki Hagiwara', 'Yoshihiro Morimoto', 'Hasan Rajabi', 'Mark D Long', 'Maha Abdulla', 'Rehan Ahmad', 'Kelly Street', 'Song Liu', 'Tao Liu', 'Donald Kufe']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Dependence on MUC1-C in Progression of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'MUC1-C Activates the BAF (mSWI/SNF) Complex in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', 'MUC1-C integrates type II interferon and chromatin remodeling pathways in immunosuppression of prostate cancer.', 'MUC1-C activates the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex in integrating redox balance with progression of human prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Addiction of Cancer Stem Cells to MUC1-C in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Progression.', 'JUN-induced super-enhancer RNA forms R-loop to promote nasopharyngeal carcinoma metastasis.', 'MUC1-C is necessary for SHP2 activation and BRAF inhibitor resistance in BRAF(V600E) mutant colorectal cancer.', 'Dependence on MUC1-C in Progression of Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'MUC1-C is a master regulator of MICA/B NKG2D ligand and exosome secretion in human cancer cells.', 'MUC1-C Dictates PBRM1-Mediated Chronic Induction of Interferon Signaling, DNA Damage Resistance, and Immunosuppression in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.']"""

Online mindfulness programmes may provide the mechanism to support cancer survivors manage FCR and distress, and improve people's well-being over the short, medium and long term. The primary aim of this study is to determine the potential efficacy of MindOnLine, a 9 session mindfulness-based programme for survivors of breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. A formal economic programme will also be conducted.  Methods and analysis:   A single-blind randomised controlled trial to determine the efficacy and cost-efficacy of a MindOnLine programme for cancer survivors. A total of 400 people living with cancer will be recruited via online advertisements on social media platforms, peak consumer advocacy groups or through outpatient services at healthcare providers across Victoria, Australia. People will be randomly allocated to either the MindOnLine programme (n=200) or waitlist control (n=200). Participant assessments will occur at baseline, at 9 weeks and 9-month follow-up. The primary outcome is change in Fear of Recurrence Index Score total score between baseline and 9 weeks; secondary outcomes are changes in depression and anxiety, quality of life and mindfulness. The economic analysis comprises a cost-consequences analysis where all outcomes will be compared with costs.

Design:   Prospective cohort study.  Setting:   Substudy including physicians participating in a Spanish cohort study with open enrolment.  Participants:   Among 22 800 participants in the cohort as of May 2018, there were 2371 physicians who had replied to the cohort baseline questionnaire, had an email account and were younger than 65 years (retirement age in Spain). From this subsample, 890 replied to an online questionnaire focused on their clinical practices related to the counselling provided to their patients and to their prescription practices of preventive medications.

Outcome measures:   Frequency of counselling given to their patients on specific practices of breast, colorectal and prostate cancer screenings.  Results:   Counselling on cancer screening to their patients was provided by 65% of physicians in a scenario of colorectal cancer, 59% for prostate cancer and 58% for breast cancer. More frequent cancer screening counselling was associated with the specialties of family medicine (OR=9.4, 95% CI 5.1 to 17.1) and internal medicine (OR=2.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 5.7) as compared with other specialties.

DAE frequency and time to onset were calculated and clinicopathological features and management described. Associations between dAE occurrence and clinical trial participation, as well as abiraterone/prednisone exposure were detected using logistic regression models.  Results:   Seventy-one (23.4%) patients had all-grade dAE occurring at a median of 77 (IQR: 30-135) days post-exposure. Twenty (6.6%) dAE-related therapy interruptions included: 8 (2.6%) with dose maintained on rechallenge, 7 (2.3%) with dose reduction and 5 (1.7%) with discontinuation. Common dAEs were maculopapular rashes (33.8%) and xerosis (32.4%). Seven (77.8%) of 9 histological analyses of skin biopsies supported a drug reaction. No significant differences in laboratory hematological, hepatic and renal function were detected between dAE and no dAE cohorts. Most treated grade 1/2 dAEs (29, 40.8%) required topical steroids (14, 19.7%); few required oral steroids (3, 4.2%) ± oral antihistamines. Most grade 3 dAEs (8, 11.3%) required oral/topical steroids (5, 7.0%); few required topical steroids (3, 4.2%) ± oral antihistamines. Clinical trial patients (180, 59.4%) were more likely to report dAEs than those in the off-trial setting (OR=5.1 [95% CI 2.55-10.12]; p <0.001).

Incidence data (through 2018) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2019) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2022, 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States, including approximately 350 deaths per day from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death. Incidence during 2014 through 2018 continued a slow increase for female breast cancer (by 0.5% annually) and remained stable for prostate cancer, despite a 4% to 6% annual increase for advanced disease since 2011. Consequently, the proportion of prostate cancer diagnosed at a distant stage increased from 3.9% to 8.2% over the past decade. In contrast, lung cancer incidence continued to decline steeply for advanced disease while rates for localized-stage increased suddenly by 4.5% annually, contributing to gains both in the proportion of localized-stage diagnoses (from 17% in 2004 to 28% in 2018) and 3-year relative survival (from 21% to 31%). Mortality patterns reflect incidence trends, with declines accelerating for lung cancer, slowing for breast cancer, and stabilizing for prostate cancer. In summary, progress has stagnated for breast and prostate cancers but strengthened for lung cancer, coinciding with changes in medical practice related to cancer screening and/or treatment.

However, platinum compounds are generally only applied after the failure of multiple prior-line treatment options. This study investigated whether acquired resistance against ionizing radiation or docetaxel chemotherapy-two commonly applied treatment modalities in prostate cancer-influences the cisplatin (CDDP) tolerance in mCRPC cell line models.  Methods:   Age-matched parental as well as radio- or docetaxel-resistant DU145 and PC-3 cell lines were treated with CDDP and their sensitivity was assessed by measurements of growth rates, viability, apoptosis, metabolic activity and colony formation ability.  Results:   The data suggest that docetaxel resistance does not influence CDDP tolerance in all tested docetaxel-resistant cell lines. Radio-resistance was associated with sensitization to CDDP in PC-3, but not in DU145 cells. In general, DU145 cells tolerated higher CDDP concentrations than PC-3 cells regardless of acquired resistances. Furthermore, non-age-matched treatment-naïve PC-3 cells exhibited significantly different CDDP tolerances.  Conclusion:   Like patients, different mCRPC cell lines exhibit significant variability regarding CDDP tolerance. The presented in vitro data suggest that previous radiation treatment may be associated with a moderate sensitization to CDDP in an isogenic and age-matched setting. Therefore, previous radiotherapy or docetaxel chemotherapy might be no contraindication against initiation of platinum chemotherapy in selected mCRPC patients.""","""['Lukas Donix', 'Holger H H Erb', 'Claudia Peitzsch', 'Anna Dubrovska', 'Manuel Pfeifer', 'Christian Thomas', 'Susanne Fuessel', 'Kati Erdmann']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Taxane-induced Attenuation of the CXCR2/BCL-2 Axis Sensitizes Prostate Cancer to Platinum-based Treatment.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Distinct Response to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy among Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring Alterations in Genes Involved in Homologous Recombination.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Anti-tumour activity of platinum compounds in advanced prostate cancer-a systematic literature review.', 'Comprehensive Evaluation of Multiple Approaches Targeting ABCB1 to Resensitize Docetaxel-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.']"""

It is currently unknown how the androgen receptor (AR) represses GPER1 expression. Here, we found that two GPER1 mRNA variants (GPER1v2 and GPER1v4) were transcriptionally repressed, not via transcript destabilization, by the androgen-activated AR. Although no AR binding was found in all active promoters near GPER1, data from promoter assays suggested that both variants' promoters were inhibited by androgen treatment. Site-directed mutagenesis on Sp1/Sp3 binding sites revealed their role in supporting the basal expression of GPER1. Knockdown of Sp1 and Sp3 together but not separately repressed GPER1 expression whereas overexpression of both Sp1 and Sp3 together was required to alleviate AR repression of GPER1. Based on the chromatin immunoprecipitation data, Sp3 was found to bind to the promoters prior to the binding of Sp1 and RNA polymerase II. However, the binding of all three transcription factors was inhibited by DHT treatment. Concordantly, DHT treatment induced nuclear interactions between AR and Sp1 or Sp3.

In the present study, the organic extracts and fractions of various parts of Ornithogalum bungei were investigated for in vitro cytotoxic properties on three human cancer cell lines, hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), prostate cancer (PC3), and leukemia (K562) cells.  Methods:   The present experimental study was conducted at Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Tehran, Iran) during 2017-2019. Separately extracted plant materials, including bulbs, stems, and flowers of O. bungei were assessed by the tetrazolium dye-based colorimetric assay (MTT). The selected extracts were submitted to fractionation using vacuum liquid chromatography and after MTT assay, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 (value for each fraction was determined. The data were analyzed using One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   The cytotoxicity of the bulb's methanol extract and the dichloromethane extract of aerial parts increased in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner. In the HepG2 cell line, the best IC50 values of fractions from DCM extracts of aerial parts were determined to be 19.8±10.2 µg/mL after 24 hours of exposure and 19.39±6.4 µg/mL following 48 hours of exposure. In the PC3 cell line, after 48 hours of exposure, the IC50 values of fractions were unaccountable, while the percentage of inhibition for A6 to A11 in 24 hours of exposure was more than 40 µg/mL.

Of all participants, 97% of them had concurrent short-course hormone therapy (HT), either luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog (LHRHa) or 150 mg of bicalutamide daily. This exploratory analysis compares efficacy and side effects in a nonrandomized comparison.  Methods and materials:   In our study, 2700 patients received LHRHa and 403 received bicalutamide. The primary endpoint was biochemical/clinical failure. Groups were compared with Cox regression adjusted for various prognostic factors and stratified by radiation therapy dose. A key secondary endpoint was erectile dysfunction (ED) assessed by clinicians (using scores from Late Effects on Normal Tissues: Subjective/Objective/Management [LENT-SOM] subjective erectile function for vaginal penetration) and patients (single items within the University of California-Los Angeles Prostate Cancer Index [UCLA PCI] and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC]-50 questionnaires) at 2 years and compared between HT regimens by χ2 trend test.  Results:   Bicalutamide patients were significantly younger (median 67 vs 69 years LHRHa). Median follow-up was 9.3 years. There was no difference in biochemical or clinical failure with an adjusted hazard ratio or 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.77-1.23; P = .8). At 2 years, grade ≥2 LENT-SOM ED was reported in significantly more LHRHa patients (313 out of 590; 53%) versus bicalutamide (17 out of 68; 25%) (P < .0001). There were no differences in ED seen with UCLA-PCI and EPIC-50 questionnaires.

However, its mechanism of action and its regulation are not well known in prostate cancer (PCa). A general mechanism of action of lncRNAs is their interaction with other epigenetic regulators including microRNAs (miRNAs).  Methods:   Using lentiviral stable miRNA transfection together with cell biology functional assays and gene expression/target analysis, we investigated the interaction between MALAT1 and miR-423-5p, defined as a target with in silico prediction analysis, in PCa.  Results:   Through bioinformatic analysis of data available from TCGA, we have found that MALAT1 expression correlates with high Gleason grade, metastasis occurrence, and reduced survival in PCa patients. These findings were validated on a TMA of PCa showing a significant correlation between MALAT1 expression with both stage and grading. We report that, in PCa cells, MALAT1 expression and activity is regulated by miR-423-5p that binds MALAT1, downregulates its expression and inhibits its activity in promoting proliferation, migration, and invasion. Using NanoString analysis, we unraveled downstream cell pathways that were affected by miR-423-5p expression and MALAT1 downregulation and identified several alterations in genes that are involved in metastatic response and angiogenic pathways. In addition, we showed that the overexpression of miR-423-5p increases survival and decreases metastases formation in a xenograft mouse model.

Mounting evidence has unveiled that lncRNAs play critical roles in malignancies, including ovarian cancer. Although the tumor suppressor function of HCG11 in prostate cancer and glioma has been proved, investigations on HCG11 role in ovarian cancer are still scarce.  Methods:   Gene or protein expression was quantified by RT-qPCR or western blot. HCG11 effects on ovarian cancer were assessed by functional assays. Bioinformatics analysis and mechanism experiments were implemented to identify the association among HCG11, miR-1270, and PTEN.  Results:   HCG11 was weakly expressed in ovarian cancer and functioned as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer by retarding cell proliferation, migration, and EMT. Besides, HCG11 could bind to miR-1270 and PTEN was a target gene of miR-1270. Mechanically, HCG11 competitively bound with miR-1270 to upregulate PTEN. From rescue experiments, HCG11 impeded AKT/mTOR pathway to retard ovarian cancer cell growth by miR-1270/PTEN.  Conclusions:   HCG11 was a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer cells and additionally, HCG11 regulated AKT/mTOR pathway to hinder ovarian cancer cell growth via modulating miR-1270/PTEN, indicating that HCG11 may represent a promising target for effective treatment of ovarian cancer patients.""","""['Xiaoping Chen', 'Yusheng Yang', 'Jie Sun', 'Chaofeng Hu', 'Xiaohong Ge', 'Rong Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Obstet Gynaecol Res""","""['Muscleblind-like 1 antisense RNA 1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer by sponging miR-181a-5p and regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'LncRNA HCG11/miR-579-3p/MDM2 axis modulates malignant biological properties in pancreatic carcinoma via Notch/Hes1 signaling pathway.', 'METTL3-mediated maturation of miR-126-5p promotes ovarian cancer progression via PTEN-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'The miRNA mir-582-3p suppresses ovarian cancer progression by targeting AKT/MTOR signaling via lncRNA TUG1.', 'The lncRNA SNHG15/miR-18a-5p axis promotes cell proliferation in ovarian cancer through activating Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Identification of lncRNAs Deregulated in Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Based on a Gene Expression Profiling Meta-Analysis.']"""

Immune therapy by checkpoint inhibitors, has become a powerful new tool in the treatment of melanoma and lung cancer, and it is currently being used in clinical trials in other cancers, including mCRPC. However, so far, clinical trials with PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors have been disappointing. In the present paper we develop a mathematical model to assess the efficacy of any combination of ADT with cancer vaccine, PD-1 inhibitor, and CTLA-4 inhibitor. The model is represented by a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for cells, cytokines and drugs whose density/concentration evolves in time within the tumor. Efficacy of treatment is determined by the reduction in tumor volume at the endpoint of treatment. In mice experiments with ADT and various combinations of PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors, tumor volume at day 30 was always larger than the initial tumor. Our model, however, shows that we can decrease tumor volume with large enough dose; for example, with 10 fold increase in the dose of anti-PD-1, initial tumor volume will decrease by 60%. Although the treatment with ADT in combination with PD-1 inhibitor or CTLA-4 inhibitor has been disappointing in clinical trials, our simulations suggest that, disregarding negative effects, combinations of ADT with checkpoint inhibitors can be effective in reducing tumor volume if larger doses are used.

We present our experience of using dHACM in a cohort of patients undergoing nerve-sparing (NS) robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP). Our objective is to investigate the functional and oncological outcomes of NS after placing amniotic or dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (dHACM) on preserved neurovascular bundles (NVBs). From 2013 to 2019, our institution performed transperitoneal multi-port da Vinci robotic prostatectomy. The NVBs are spared by releasing their fascial planes posteriorly, followed by an anterior release of the plane at a similar level. Once the retrograde release of the NVB is performed then 599 patients underwent placement of dHACM graft (AmnioFix by MiMedx, Marietta, GA, USA). The graft was cut into two 4 × 1 cm pieces and laid over the NVB as a wrap. In order to inform the urological community of oncological and functional outcomes, we excluded patients with less than 12 months follow up (n = 64), benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 5), and unilateral NS (n = 1). 529 (88%) patients were included in this study who underwent a partial or full bilateral NS with dHACM. 529 patients were followed-up for a median (IQR) of 42 months (25-89). Demographics include median (IQR) age 57 years (52-62), median preoperative SHIM score of 24 (21-15), and AUASS of 5 (2-11). Full NS was performed in 74% (391/529). Pathological staging was pT2 = 399 (75%), pT3a = 107 (20%), pT3b = 19 (4%) and pT4 = 4 (1%) with N1 = 3 (0.6%). The number of patients with PSM was 86 (16%), and the overall BCR in the entire cohort was 10%. Postoperatively, 434 (82%) were sexually active. Median time to potency was 119 (37-420) days and time to continence was 42 (23-91) days. Regarding full vs partial NS: median post op SHIM score 18 (13-20) vs 15 (6-20), median time to potency 92 (35-365) days vs 184 (42-560) days, and median time to continence 42 (23-91) days vs 44 (30-92) days. Age > 55 vs ≤ 55 years: median post op SHIM score 18 (12-20) vs 15 (10-20), median time to potency 167 days (42-549) vs 80 (35-288) days, and median time to continence 42 (25-116) days vs 42 (29-76) days. In our series the application of amniotic membrane/dHACM has led to acceptable post RALP outcomes. The BCR rate of 10% in addition to the recovery of potency at a median time of 3 months and continence at 6 weeks is an encouraging result of dHACM. Our findings indicate that dHACM allowed for an even faster period for continence recovery which was independent of grade of NS.

Therefore, we analyzed clinicopathological information to determine the significance of reassessment by experienced urological pathologists at a high-volume institution to identify factors involved in the agreement or disagreement of biopsy and surgical GGs. In total, 1325 prostate adenocarcinomas were analyzed, and the GG was changed in 452/1325 (34.1%) cases (359 cases were upgraded, and 93 cases were downgraded). We compared the highest GG based on biopsy specimens, with the final GG based on surgical specimens of 210 cases. The agreement rate between the surgical GG performed and assessed in our institute and the highest biopsy GG assessed by an outside pathologist was 34.8% (73/210); the agreement rate increased significantly to 50% (105/210) when biopsy specimens were reevaluated in our institute (chi-square test, P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that only the length of the lesion in the positive core with the highest GG in the biopsy was a significant factor for determining the agreement between biopsy GG and surgical GG, with an odds ratio of 1.136 (95% confidence interval: 1.057-1.221; P < 0.01). Thus, reassessment by experienced urological pathologists at high-volume institutions improved the agreement rate. However, it should be noted there is a high probability of discordance between a small number of lesions or short lesions and surgical GG.""","""['Yoichiro Okubo', 'Yayoi Yamamoto', 'Shinya Sato', 'Emi Yoshioka', 'Masaki Suzuki', 'Kota Washimi', 'Kimito Osaka', 'Takahisa Suzuki', 'Tomoyuki Yokose', 'Takeshi Kishida', 'Yohei Miyagi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Trends in disagreement with outside genitourinary pathology diagnoses at an academic center.', 'Combined multiple clinical characteristics for prediction of discordance in grade and stage in prostate cancer patients undergoing systematic biopsy and radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer grading: the effect of stratification of needle biopsy Gleason Score 4 + 3 as high or intermediate grade.', 'An update of the Gleason grading system.', 'Contemporary Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: An Update With Discussion on Practical Issues to Implement the 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma.', 'Case report: Adrenal myelolipoma resected by laparoscopic surgery.', 'Risk Factors of Non-en Bloc Resection and Non-R0 Resection During Endoscopic Resection in the Treatment of Superficial Duodenal Epithelial Lesions.']"""

Although others have documented the impact on new cancer diagnoses, trends in new starts for oncology drugs are less clear. We examined changes in new users of oral oncology medications in the US following COVID-19 stay-at-home orders in 2020 compared to prior years.  Methods:   We examined prescription data for members enrolled with a national pharmacy benefits manager in the US from January 1-October 31 of 2018, 2019, and/or 2020. This is a retrospective, observational study comparing new users per 100,000 members per month for all oral oncology drugs, and separately for breast, lung, and prostate cancer, leukemia, and melanoma oral drugs. We performed a difference-in-differences analysis for change in new users from pre-period (prior to pandemic-induced disruption, January-March), to post-period (following pandemic-induced disruption, April-October), between 2020 and 2019, and 2020 and 2018.  Results:   New oral oncology drug users per 100,000 members per month declined by an additional 11.3% in the 2020 post-period compared to 2019 (p = 0.048). New oral breast cancer drug starts declined by an additional 14.0% in the 2020 post-period compared to 2019 (p = 0.040). Similar but non-significant trends were found between 2020 and 2018.

However, to fully understand the function of H2O2, it is critical to monitor its intracellular and/or extracellular concentrations. Current techniques implemented to address this need require large sample volumes, expensive instrumentation, and long sample preparation and analysis times, inapplicable to inline or online monitoring. In this paper, a new integrated microfluidic device capable of overcoming these limitations is demonstrated for the colorimetric detection of extracellular hydrogen peroxide H2O2. The device contains an optical waveguide to determine absorbance changes and micromixers to enable complete mixing of reagents using a passive approach. This novel H2O2-sensing device has allowed the detection of H2O2 in the range of 0.5-60 μM with a detection limit of 167 ± 5.8 nM and a sensitivity of 13.5 ± 0.1 AU/mM. Proof of concept of the device was demonstrated by quantifying H2O2 release from benign prostatic epithelial (BPH-1) cells upon stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Results show that this integrated device can be potentially utilized to continuously monitor cell-released metabolites autonomously without constant human supervision during the process. Furthermore, this can be achieved without interfering with the cell culture conditions, as only a very small volume of conditioned media (less than 0.4 μL), and not the cells, is required.""","""['Esma Dervisevic', 'Nicolas H Voelcker', 'Gail Risbridger', 'Kellie L Tuck', 'Victor J Cadarso']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['A nanostructured microfluidic device for plasmon-assisted electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide released from cancer cells.', 'A simple colorimetric method for the measurement of hydrogen peroxide produced by cells in culture.', 'Simple paper-based colorimetric and fluorescent glucose sensor using N-doped carbon dots and metal oxide hybrid structures.', 'Non-invasive continuous monitoring of pro-oxidant effects of engineered nanoparticles on aquatic microorganisms.', 'Solid State Sensors for Hydrogen Peroxide Detection.', 'A Background-Free SERS Strategy for Sensitive Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide.']"""

Methods:   A total of 101 prostate cancer regions extracted from the MR images of 44 patients were identified and divided into training (n = 31 with 72 cancer regions) and test datasets (n = 13 with 29 cancer regions). Each dataset included low-grade tumors (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] GG ≤ 2) and high-grade tumors (ISUP GG ≥ 3).

Joint histogram features can visualize temporally changing perfusion patterns in prostate cancer based on the joint histograms between different phases or subtraction phases of DCE images. Nine signatures (a set of significant features related to GGs) were determined using the best combinations of features selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Further, support vector machine models with the nine signatures were built based on a leave-one-out cross-validation for the training dataset and evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.  Results:   The signature showing the best performance was constructed using six features derived from the joint histograms, DCE original images, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps.

Using laser-capture microscopy in combination with gene expression analysis, we also determined the expression patterns of Wnt signaling components in stromal and cancer cells in advanced human prostate cancer specimens. To investigate how the stroma-derived Wnt ligands affect prostate development and homeostasis, we used a Col1a2-CreERT2 mouse model to disrupt the Wnt transporter Wntless specifically in prostate stromal cells.  Results:   We showed that the prostate stromal cells are a major source of several Wnt ligands. Visium spatial gene expression analysis revealed a distinct spatial distribution of Wnt ligands in the prostatic glands. We also showed that Wnt signaling components are highly expressed in the stromal compartment of primary and advanced human prostate cancer.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of hormone-sensitive OMPC patients treated initially with curative-intent radical prostatectomy followed by disease recurrence and metastasis-directed stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) at our institution. Prostate bed recurrence rates were compared between patients who had PBRT at any point (i.e., before oligometastatic diagnosis or concurrently with MDT) versus those with no history of PBRT.  Results:   Seventy-seven patients were included, and 68.8% had received PBRT. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between those who had received and had not received PBRT. There were five prostate bed recurrences following MDT, specifically with a 24-month cumulative incidence of 30.4% in patients who did not have PBRT and 2.4% in those who did (p = 0.03). Three of the five recurrences were isolated to the prostate bed at time of recurrence.  Conclusions:   Relapsed oligometastatic prostate cancer patients who have not received maximal local consolidative therapy to the prostate bed may have higher rates of local failure.

The present study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of the prostate cancer‑associated transcript 1 (PCAT1)/miR‑134‑3p/pituitary homeobox 2 (PITX2) in BC. Reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR was performed to examine the expression of miR‑134‑3p.

Knockdown of PCAT1 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but promoted apoptosis in human BC cell lines. The results of the dual‑luciferase assay showed that PCAT1 targeted miR‑134‑3p, and PITX2 was a potential target of miR‑134‑3p. Western blotting results demonstrated that PCAT1 knockdown significantly reduced the protein expression levels of anti‑apoptotic protein Bcl‑2, and significantly upregulated the protein expression levels of proapoptotic proteins, Bax, cleaved caspase‑3 and cleaved caspase‑9. Furthermore, the effect of a miR‑134‑3p inhibitor on BC progression was rescued by the knockdown of PITX2 in cells transfected with short hairpin RNA‑lncRNA PCAT1.

Menin, which is encoded by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), serves as a direct link between AR and the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) complex in PCa development by activating AR target genes through histone H3 lysine 4 methylation. Although menin is a critical component of AR signaling, its tumorigenic role in AR-independent PCa cells remains unknown. Here, we compared the role of menin in AR-positive and AR-negative PCa cells via RNAi-mediated or pharmacological inhibition of menin. We demonstrated that menin was involved in tumor cell growth and metastasis in PCa cells with low or deficient levels of AR. The inhibition of menin significantly diminished the growth of PCa cells and induced apoptosis, regardless of the presence of AR. Additionally, transcriptome analysis showed that the expression of many metastasis-associated genes was perturbed by menin inhibition in AR-negative DU145 cells. Furthermore, wound-healing assay results showed that menin promoted cell migration in AR-independent cellular contexts.

Methods:   HBCRs capture, in a given institution, every single patient with a confirmed malignancy. In this study, all cases evaluated between 2014 and 2018 were included in the HBCR. In compliance with the International Agency for Research on Cancer recommendations, cases were classified as analytic or non-analytic. Data derived from an exhaustive selection of patients was stored in a computing platform owned by the institution, meeting the 2016 Facility Oncology Registry Data Standards recommendations. Quality control was performed by evaluating comparability, timeliness, validity, and completeness.  Results:   A total of 24,405 new cases were registered between 2014 and 2018, from which 4253 (17.4%) died. Among all cases, based on the anatomic location, most common malignancies were breast (n = 1554), thyroid (n = 1346), hematolymphoid (n = 1251), prostatic (n = 805), and colorectal (n = 624). The behavior of the new cases was consistent with an incremental trend.  Conclusion:   Upon implementing the HBCR, major challenges were identified (i.e., a precise definition of cases, the development of processes for capturing new cases, a standardized data collection strategy, and carrying-out an appropriate patient follow-up). Based on our experience, the success of an HBCR largely relies on the interest from the institution, the engagement of stakeholders and financial support, that is, it depends on the adequate access over time to funding, technological, and staffing resources.""","""['Luis G Parra-Lara', 'Diana M Mendoza-Urbano', 'Ángela R Zambrano', 'Andrea Valencia-Orozco', 'Juan C Bravo-Ocaña', 'Luis E Bravo-Ocaña', 'Fernando Rosso']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Resource requirements for cancer registration in areas with limited resources: Analysis of cost data from four low- and middle-income countries.', 'The role of hospital-based cancer registries in low and middle income countries-The Nigerian Case Study.', 'Evaluation of institutional cancer registries in Colombia.', 'Trauma registry implementation in low- and middle-income countries: challenges and opportunities.', 'Tuberculosis.', 'Gastric adenocarcinoma burden, trends and survival in Cali, Colombia: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Clinical outcomes in patients with solid tumors living in rural and urban areas followed via telemedicine: experience in a highly complex latin american hospital.']"""

In archival tumor samples, prostate tumors showed comparatively low expression of key immune biomarkers. DNA damage-response alterations, phosphatase and tensin homolog status and PD-L1 expression levels were similar between hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancers. In planned biomarker analysis, longer progression-free survival was seen with atezolizumab in patients with high PD-L1 IC2/3, CD8 expression and established immune gene signatures. Exploratory analysis linked progression-free survival in the atezolizumab arm with immune genes such as CXCL9 and TAP1, together with other potentially relevant biomarkers including phosphatase and tensin homolog alterations.

However, combining ICT with anti-PI3K inhibitors have been challenging because the multifaceted effects of PI3K on both cancer cells and immune cells within the tumor microenvironment.

Mechanistically, BAY1082439 converts cancer cell-intrinsic immune-suppression to immune-stimulation by promoting IFNα/IFNγ pathway activation, β2-microglubin expression and CXCL10/CCL5 secretion. With its preferential regulatory T cell inhibition activity, BAY1082439 promotes clonal expansion of tumor-associated CD8+ T cells, most likely via tertiary lymphoid structures.

The programmed cell death after detachment is known as anoikis, acting as a metastasis barrier. However, the most aggressive cancer cells escape anoikis and other cell death patterns to initiate the metastatic cascade. This study revealed the role of cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) in autophagy modulation and anoikis resistance during ECM detachment. CEMIP amplification during ECM detachment resulted in protective autophagy induction via a mechanism dependent on the dissociation of the B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Beclin1 complex. Additional investigation revealed that acting transcription factor 4 (ATF4) triggered CEMIP transcription and enhanced protein kinase C alpha (PKCα) membrane translocation, which regulated the serine70 phosphorylation of Bcl-2, while the subsequent dissociation of the Bcl-2/Beclin1 complex led to autophagy. Therefore, CEMIP antagonization attenuated metastasis formation in vivo. In conclusion, inhibiting CEMIP-mediated protective autophagy may provide a therapeutic strategy for metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). This study delineates a novel role of CEMIP in anoikis resistance and provides new insight into seeking therapeutic strategies for metastatic PCa.""","""['Ying Yu#', 'Bing Liu#', 'Xuexiang Li#', 'Dingheng Lu', 'Likun Yang', 'Liang Chen', 'Yunxue Li', 'Lulin Cheng', 'Fang Lv', 'Pu Zhang', 'Yarong Song', 'Yifei Xing']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['AMPK/GSK3β/β-catenin cascade-triggered overexpression of CEMIP promotes migration and invasion in anoikis-resistant prostate cancer cells by enhancing metabolic reprogramming.', 'CircCEMIP promotes anoikis-resistance by enhancing protective autophagy in prostate cancer cells.', 'CEMIP promotes extracellular matrix-detached prostate cancer cell survival by inhibiting ferroptosis.', 'Targeting anoikis resistance in prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Phyto-targeting the CEMIP Expression as a Strategy to Prevent Pancreatic Cancer Metastasis.', 'The new insights into autophagy in thyroid cancer progression.', 'MST4 promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of gastric cancer by enhancing autophagy.', 'EBNA2 mediates lipid metabolism and tumorigenesis through activation of ATF4 pathway.', ""Novel Functionalized Spiro Indoline-3,5'-pyrroline-2,2'dione Derivatives: Synthesis, Characterization, Drug-Likeness, ADME, and Anticancer Potential."", 'Anoikis in phenotypic reprogramming of the prostate tumor microenvironment.']"""

Materials and methods:   A 12-question survey assessing knowledge of genetics PCA risk and FH was administered December 2017 to March 2018 in the Philadelphia area and at the Mid-Atlantic AUA meeting (March 2018). Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and urologists across practice settings from March-October 2020 as part of a larger study based on the Tailored Implementation in Chronic Diseases framework. Helix was then developed followed by user testing.  Results:   Fifty-six providers (50% urologists) responded to the survey. Multiple FH and genetic knowledge gaps were identified: only 66% collected maternal FH and 43% correctly identified BRCA2 and association to aggressive PCA. Genetic counseling gaps included low rates of discussing genetic discrimination laws (45%). Provider interviews (n = 14) identified barriers to FH intake including access to details and time needed. In user testing (n = 10), providers found Helix helpful for FH collection. All providers found Helix easy to use, suggesting expanded clinical use.

It is unclear whether associations for specific inflammatory biomarkers are causal or due to bias. In order to examine whether altered genetically predicted concentration of circulating cytokines are associated with cancer development, we performed a two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis.  Methods:   Up to 31,112 individuals of European descent were included in genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of 47 circulating cytokines. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) robustly associated with the cytokines, located in or close to their coding gene (cis), were used as instrumental variables. Inverse-variance weighted MR was used as the primary analysis, and the MR assumptions were evaluated in sensitivity and colocalization analyses and a false discovery rate (FDR) correction for multiple comparisons was applied. Corresponding germline GWAS summary data for five cancer outcomes (breast, endometrial, lung, ovarian, and prostate), and their subtypes were selected from the largest cancer-specific GWASs available (cases ranging from 12,906 for endometrial to 133,384 for breast cancer).  Results:   There was evidence of inverse associations of macrophage migration inhibitory factor with breast cancer (OR per SD = 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist with endometrial cancer (0.86, 0.80 to 0.93), interleukin-18 with lung cancer (0.87, 0.81 to 0.93), and beta-chemokine-RANTES with ovarian cancer (0.70, 0.57 to 0.85) and positive associations of monokine induced by gamma interferon with endometrial cancer (3.73, 1.86 to 7.47) and cutaneous T-cell attracting chemokine with lung cancer (1.51, 1.22 to 1.87). These associations were similar in sensitivity analyses and supported in colocalization analyses.  Conclusions:   Our study adds to current knowledge on the role of specific inflammatory biomarker pathways in cancer aetiology.

Quercetin (QRT), a naturally occurring flavonoid, has wide biological effects including antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antiviral activities. The anticancer activity is considered the most valuable effect of QRT against several types of cancer, including prostate, liver, lung, colon, and breast cancer. Scorpion venom peptides (SV) has been found to induce apoptosis and aggravate cancer cells, making it a promising anticancer agent. QRT, SV, and Phospholipon® 90H (PL) were incorporated in a nano-based delivery platform to assess QRT's cellular uptake and antiproliferative efficacy against a lung cancer cell line derived from human breast cancer cells MCF-7. Several nanovesicles were prepared and optimized, using four-factor Box-Behnken, in an experimental design. The optimized phytosomes showed vesicle size and zeta potential values of 116.9 nm and 31.5 mV, respectively. The IC50 values revealed that MCF-7 cells were significantly more sensitive to the optimized QRT formula than the plain formula and raw QRT. Cell cycle analysis revealed that optimized QRT formula treatment resulted in significant cell cycle arrest at the S phase. The results also indicated that treatment with QRT formula significantly increased caspase-9, Bax, Bcl-2, and p53 mRNA expression, compared with the plain formula and QRT. In terms of the inflammatory markers, the QRT formula significantly reduced the activity of TNF-α and NF-κB, in comparison with the plain formula and QRT only.

The percentage of bacterial strains showing multidrug resistance (MDR) to commonly used antibiotics is growing rapidly. Therefore, the search for alternative solutions to antibiotic therapy has become critical to combat this phenomenon. It is especially important as frequent and recurring infections can cause cancer. One example of this phenomenon is urinary tract infections that can contribute to the development of human urinary bladder carcinoma. This tumor is one of the most common malignant neoplasms in humans. It occurs almost three times more often in men than in women, and in terms of the number of cases, it is the fifth malignant neoplasm after prostate, lung, colon, and stomach cancer. The risk of developing the disease increases with age. Despite the improvement of its treatment methods, the current outcome in the advanced stages of this tumor is not satisfactory. Hence, there is an urgent need to introduce innovative solutions that will prove effective even in the advanced stage of the disease. In our study, a nanosystem based on ionic silver (Ag+) bound to a carrier-Titan yellow (TY) was analyzed. The possibility of binding the thus formed TY-Ag system to Congo red (CR) and albumin (BSA) was determined. TY-Ag binding to CR provides for better nanosystem solubility and enables its targeted intracellular transport and binding to immune complexes. The binding of TY-Ag or CR-TY-Ag to albumin also protects the system against the uncontrolled release of silver ions. It will also allow the delivery of silver in a targeted manner directly to the desired site in the case of intravenous administration of such a system. In this study, the MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) and MBC (Minimum Bactericidal Concentration) values of the TY-Ag or BSA-TY-Ag systems were determined in two reference strains (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus). The paper presents nanosystems with a size of about 40-50 nm, with an intense antibacterial effect obtained at concentrations of 0.019 mM. We have also discovered that TY-Ag free or complexed with BSA (with a minimal Ag+ dose of 15-20 μM) inhibited cancer cells proliferation. TY-Ag complex diminished migration and effectively inhibited the T24 cell viability and induced apoptosis. On the basis of the obtained results, it has been shown that the presented systems may have anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties at the same time. TY-Ag or BSA-TY-Ag are new potential drugs and may become in future important therapeutic compounds in human urinary bladder carcinoma treatment and/or potent antimicrobial factors as an alternative to antibiotics.""","""['Anna Jagusiak', 'Tomasz Gosiewski', 'Dorota Romaniszyn', 'Małgorzata Lasota', 'Anna Wiśniewska', 'Katarzyna Chłopaś', 'Barbara Ostrowska', 'Izabela Kościk', 'Małgorzata Bulanda']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Antimicrobial potency of differently coated 10 and 50\u202fnm silver nanoparticles against clinically relevant bacteria Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus.', 'Gelatin-based films containing clinoptilolite-Ag for application as wound dressing.', 'Antibacterial activity and mechanism of Ag-ZnO nanocomposite on S. aureus and GFP-expressing antibiotic resistant E. coli.', 'Nanotechnology as a therapeutic tool to combat microbial resistance.', 'Silver Nanoparticles and Their Antibacterial Applications.']"""

In this study, we investigated whether lucanthone could enhance tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis in various cancer cells. Combined treatment with lucanthone and TRAIL significantly induced apoptosis in human renal carcinoma (Caki and ACHN), prostate carcinoma (PC3), and lung carcinoma (A549) cells. However, combined treatment did not induce apoptosis in normal mouse kidney cells (TCMK-1) and normal human skin fibroblast (HSF). Lucanthone downregulated protein expression of deubiquitinase DUB3, and a decreased expression level of DUB3 markedly led to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Ectopic expression of DUB3 inhibited combined treatment with lucanthone and TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Moreover, lucanthone increased expression level of DR5 mRNA via downregulation of miR-216a-5p. Transfection of miR-216a-5p mimics suppressed the lucanthone-induced DR5 upregulation.

In this contribution, we explore the effect of tissue culture surface chemistry (standard tissue culture plastic (TCP) and a fluoroalkylsilica (FS) culture surface with inherently low surface energy) on the phenotype and adherent capacity of mesenchymal and epithelial cell populations. We demonstrate that OPCT-1 cells adherent to FS surfaces comprise both epithelial- and mesenchymal-like populations; a mesenchymal subpopulation derived from OPCT1 (P4B6B) poorly adheres to FS and formed spheroids, whereas an epithelial subpopulation derived from OPCT1 (P5B3) forms an adherent monolayer. In contrast, P4B6B cells do adhere to FS when cocultured with P5B3 cells. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that EMT/cell differentiation status dictates cell adhesive capacity and provide a novel insight into the relationship between epithelial and mesenchymal cell populations in metastasis. Importantly, the differences in adherence capacity between P4B6B and P5B3 are not apparent using standard TCP-based culture, thereby highlighting the value of using alternative culture surfaces for studying cell surface interaction/adhesion phenomena and interrogating mechanisms involved in adhesion and detachment of metastatic tumor cells.""","""['Matthew Nicklin', 'Graham J Hickman', 'A Graham Pockley', 'Carole C Perry']""","""[]""","""2020""","""None""","""ACS Appl Bio Mater""","""['A novel spontaneous model of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) using a primary prostate cancer derived cell line demonstrating distinct stem-like characteristics.', 'Stem-Like Cancer Cells in a Dynamic 3D Culture System: A Model to Study Metastatic Cell Adhesion and Anti-Cancer Drugs.', 'SLUG/SNAI2 and tumor necrosis factor generate breast cells with CD44+/CD24- phenotype.', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Prostate Cancer.', 'Epithelial mesenchymal transition traits in human breast cancer cell lines parallel the CD44(hi/)CD24 (lo/-) stem cell phenotype in human breast cancer.']"""

Augmented reality smart glasses have emerged as novel technology to support image-guided interventions. We aimed to investigate its usage while prostate biopsy.  Methods:   MRI with PIRADS-lesions ≥3 was uploaded to smart glasses (Vuzix BladeR ) and augmented reality smart glasses-assisted targeted biopsy (SMART-TB) of the prostate was performed using cognitive fusion technology at the point of care. Detection rates were compared to systematic biopsy. Feasibility for SMART-TB was assessed (10 domains from bad [1] to excellent [10]).  Results:   SMART-TB was performed for four patients. Prostate cancer detection was more likely for SMART-TB (46%; 13/28) than for systematic biopsy (27%; 13/48). Feasibility scores were high [8-10] for practicality, multitasking, execution speed, comfort and device weight and low [1-4] for handling, battery and image quality.

However, the poor CBCT image quality prevents its further clinical use. Thus, it is important to improve the HU accuracy and structure preservation of CBCT images.  Methods:   In this study, we proposed a novel method to generate synthetic CT (sCT) images from CBCT images. A multiresolution residual deep neural network (RDNN) was adopted for image regression from CBCT images to planning CT (pCT) images. At the coarse level, RDNN was first trained with a large amount of lower resolution images, which can make the network focus on coarse information and prevent overfitting problems. More fine information was obtained gradually by fine-tuning the coarse model using fewer number of higher resolution images. Our model was optimized by using aligned pCT and CBCT image pairs of a particular body region of 153 prostate cancer patients treated in our hospital (120 for training and 33 for testing). Five-fold cross-validation was used to tune the hyperparameters and the testing data were used to evaluate the performance of the final models.  Results:   The mean absolute error (MAE) between CBCT and pCT on the testing data was 352.56 HU, while the MAE between the sCT and pCT images was 52.18 HU for our proposed multiresolution RDNN model, which reduced the MAE by 85.20% (p < 0.01). In addition, the average structural similarity index measure between the sCT and CBCT was 19.64% (p = 0.01) higher than that of pCT and CBCT.  Conclusions:   The sCT images generated using our proposed multiresolution RDNN have higher HU accuracy and structural fidelity, which may promote the further applications of CBCT images in the clinic for structure segmentation, dose calculation, and adaptive radiotherapy planning.""","""['Wangjiang Wu', 'Junda Qu', 'Jing Cai', 'Ruijie Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.', 'Streaking artifact reduction for CBCT-based synthetic CT generation in adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Generating synthetic CT from low-dose cone-beam CT by using generative adversarial networks for adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Improving CBCT image quality to the CT level using RegGAN in esophageal cancer adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Etiology of Tinnitus on CT and CBCT: A Narrative Review.', 'Multi-planar 2.5D U-Net for image quality enhancement of dental cone-beam CT.', 'Deep learning methods for enhancing cone-beam CT image quality toward adaptive radiation therapy: A systematic review.']"""

Methods:   We used data from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and included 101,901 men (26,363 military and 75,538 civilian men) in the analysis conducted in 2021. We conducted binomial logistic regression analyses to determine covariate-adjusted associations between military status and receiving a PSA test in the last 2 years. We then added patient reports of SDM to the model. Finally, we looked at the joint effects of military status and SDM on the receipt of a PSA test in the last 2 years.  Results:   Military men had 1.1 times the odds of PSA testing compared to civilian men (95% CI 1.1, 1.2) after adjusting for SDM and sociodemographic and health covariates. When examining the joint effect of military status and SDM, military and civilian men had over three times the odds of receiving a PSA test in the last 2 years if they had reported SDM (OR 3.5 and OR 3.4, respectively) compared to civilian men who did not experience SDM.  Conclusion:   Military men are slightly more likely to report receiving a PSA test in the last 2 years compared to civilian men. Additionally, results show SDM plays a role in the receipt of a PSA test in both populations. These findings can serve as a foundation for tailored interventions to promote appropriate SDM for PSA screening in civilian, active duty, and veteran healthcare systems.""","""['Susan S Hoffman', 'Ashley W Smith', 'Erin E Kent', 'V Paul Doria-Rose', 'Sarah C Kobrin', 'Michelle A Mollica']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Causes Control""","""['Impact of health literacy on shared decision making for prostate-specific antigen screening in the United States.', 'Prostate cancer screening decision-making in three states: 2013 behavioral risk factor surveillance system analysis.', 'Disparities Associated with Shared Decision-making in Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'PSA-based prostate cancer screening: the role of active surveillance and informed and shared decision making.', 'Shared decision-making for prostate cancer screening and treatment: a systematic review of randomised controlled trials.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Monitoring Using Nano Zinc(II) Metal-Organic Framework-Based Optical Biosensor.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients with non-metastatic cancer, treated with non-palliative external beam radiation (RT) 2004-2016, were identified in the National Cancer Database for 11 cancer types: breast, prostate, non-prostate genitourinary, bone/soft tissue, gynecological, head/neck, lymphoma, gastrointestinal (GI), small cell lung, non-small cell lung, and central nervous system (CNS). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify predictors of peri-RT mortality controlled for 17 covariates, including patient, tumor, and treatment factors.  Results:   Approximately 1.53 million patients were identified. Peri-RT mortality was 2.46% overall, spanning two orders of magnitude from 0.14% for breast to 8.52% for CNS. Peri-RT mortality steadily improved from 3.13% in 2004 to 1.78% in 2016 (P < .0001). Major predictors of peri-RT mortality included age, baseline comorbidity, male sex, and stage (P < .0001). Conversely, higher patient volume at the treating facility and use of more conformal RT planning techniques were moderately protective (P < .0001). Racial disparities varied based on disease site, as Black patients had increased peri-RT mortality for breast, lymphoma, and GI cancers, but not for other cancer types. Lack of private insurance was associated with substantially increased peri-RT mortality regardless of cancer type.  Conclusion:   Peri-RT mortality varied considerably according to multiple factors. Sociodemographic differences highlight areas of health disparities and opportunities for quality improvement.

The aim of this study was to exploit IVD-based ST to perform 3D dose reconstruction for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy and to evaluate the robustness of the treatments against observed geometric variations.  Materials and methods:   Twenty-three fractions of high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy were analysed. The treatment planning was based on MRI. Time-resolved IVD was performed using a fibre-coupled scintillator. ST was retrospectively performed using the IVD measurements. The ST identified 2D positional shifts of each treatment catheter and thereby inferred updated source positions. For each fraction, the dose was recalculated based on the source-tracked catheter positions and compared with the original plan dose using differences in dose volume histogram indices.  Results:   Of 352 treatment catheters, 344 had shifts of less than 5 mm. Shifts between 5 and 10 mm were observed for 3 catheters, and shifts greater than 10 mm for 2 catheters. The ST failed for 3 catheters. The maximum relative difference in clinical target volume (prostate + 3 mm isotropic margin) D90% was 5%. In one fraction, the bladder D2cm3 dose increased by 18% (1.4 Gy) due to a single source position being inside the bladder rather than nearby as planned. The max increase in urethra dose was 1.5 Gy (15%).  Conclusion:   IVD-based 3D dose reconstruction for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy is feasible. The dosimetric impact of the observed catheter shifts was limited.

The aim of this study was to identify radiomic prognostic features derived from routine anatomic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences that can predict the response of the prostate cancer to nADT.  Materials and methods:   Patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (with one of clinical stage ≥ T2c, Gleason score ≥7 or presenting prostate-specific antigen ≥10) who received 3 months of ADT prior to radical external beam radiotherapy were enrolled into this study. The relative blood volume and the relative blood flow were used as dynamic MRI kinetic parameters to quantify vascular changes as responses to nADT. For all pre- and post-nADT data sets, a combination of T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted anatomic images were used to define regions of interest (ROI) as the dominant malignant nodules (DMNs) and the benign prostate (the entire prostate with the summed DMNs being subtracted). MRI textural radiomic features associated with prostate cancer response in the literature of energy and homogeneity were selected. Pyradiomics was used to extract textural features of the ROIs. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was carried out to investigate if there were statistically significant differences in values of radiomic features between: (i) benign prostate ROI and DMN pre-nADT; (ii) pre- and post-nADT of benign prostate ROI; (iii) pre- and post-nADT of DMN. Changes in radiomic features and dynamic MRI kinetic parameters were correlated using the Spearman correlation test.  Results:   Twenty prostate cancer patients were recruited into the study. The median time between the first baseline scan and the first on-treatment scan was 91.5 days (range 82-105). One patient had no discernible tumour visible, leaving 19 patients with evaluable data for the analysis. Baseline homogeneity and energy values differed significantly between benign and malignant tissue (P < 0.01). In response to nADT, homogeneity and energy showed reciprocal changes, significantly increased in benign prostate while decreasing in the DMN. The reduction in tumour homogeneity and energy feature values showed a positive association with the decline in tumour blood flow and tumour blood volume induced by androgen deprivation as derived from dynamic MRI parameters.  Conclusion:   Energy and homogeneity radiomic features derived from MRI of benign and malignant prostate showed significant reciprocal changes in response to nADT. This study confirms the potential of these radiomic features to act as surrogate markers of tumour androgen sensitivity due to their strong association with ADT-induced physiological effects in prostate tumours.""","""['H Tharmalingam', 'Y M Tsang', 'R Alonzi', 'W Beasley', 'N J Taylor', 'A McWilliam', 'A Padhani', 'A Choudhury', 'P J Hoskin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['The Effect of Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Tumor Hypoxia in High-Grade Prostate Cancer: An 18F-MISO PET-MRI Study.', 'Short-term neoadjuvant androgen deprivation and radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer: 10-year data from the TROG 96.01 randomised trial.', 'Prostate Cancer: assessing the effects of androgen-deprivation therapy using quantitative diffusion-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.', 'Dose escalated external beam radiotherapy versus neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and conventional dose external beam radiotherapy for clinically localized prostate cancer: do we need both?', 'Variation in the Prescription of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radiotherapy in the Netherlands, and Adherence to European Association of Urology Guidelines: A Population-based Study.', 'The Impact of Image Acquisition Parameters and ComBat Harmonization on the Predictive Performance of Radiomics: A Renal Cell Carcinoma Model.', 'CT Reconstruction Kernels and the Effect of Pre- and Post-Processing on the Reproducibility of Handcrafted Radiomic Features.']"""

Tumor-targeted delivery and controlled release of antitumor drug are key-elements of any combined therapy. Considering these important elements, we designed and constructed tumor microenvironment (TME)-activated nanoprobes (PGP/CaCO3@IR820/DTX-HA). The CaCO3 shell could efficiently entrap the photosensitizer IR820 and the chemotherapeutic docetaxel (DTX) on the surface of pentagonal gold prisms (PGPs) to prevent elimination from the circulation, and it could act as a TME-trigger to achieve TME-responsive drug release. After modification with hyaluronic acid, PGP/CaCO3@IR820/DTX-HA was capable of synergistic TME-triggered PTT/PDT/CT and tumor-targeted delivery. Our in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that PGP/CaCO3@IR820/DTX-HA could achieve synergistic antitumor effects following near-infrared (NIR)-light irradiation. In addition, using the NIR fluorescence signal from IR820 and the photoacoustic (PA) signal from PGPs, i.e., through multimodal fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging, we could monitor the in vivo distribution and excretion of PGP/CaCO3@IR820/DTX-HA. Therefore, it can be concluded that PGP/CaCO3@IR820/DTX-HA shows promising clinical translational potential as a treatment for CRPC. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Utilizing pentagonal gold prisms (PGPs), we constructed a multifunctional nanoplatform (PGP/CaCO3@IR820/DTX-HA) for effectively delivering agents into the tumor microenvironment (TME) for the diagnosis and therapy of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The synthetic nanoplatform can satisfy TME-activated synergistic photothermal therapy (PTT)/photodynamic therapy (PDT)/chemical therapy (CT) and NIR fluorescence imaging/photoacoustic (PA) imaging. Hyaluronic acid (HA) on the surface of nanoplatform allowed the specific tumor-targeting capacity and biocompatibility.

A low tissue level of the metabolite citrate has additionally been connected to aggressive disease and recurrence in this patient group. However, for radiotherapy prostate cancer patients, few prognostic biomarkers have been suggested. The main aim of this study was to use an integrated tissue analysis to evaluate metabolites and expression of TOP2A and EZH2 as predictors for recurrence among radiotherapy patients.

Metabolic profiles were acquired from fresh frozen TRUS biopsies using high resolution-magic angle spinning MRS.

Eleven radical prostatectomy cohorts of a total of 2059 patients were used for validation in a meta-analysis.  Results:   Among radiotherapy patients with up to 11 years of follow-up, a low level of citrate was found to predict recurrence, p = 0.001 (C-index = 0.74). Citrate had a higher predictive ability compared with individual clinical variables, highlighting its strength as a potential biomarker for recurrence. The dual upregulation of TOP2A and EZH2 was suggested as a biomarker for recurrence, particularly for patients not receiving neoadjuvant hormonal treatment, p = 0.001 (C-index = 0.84). While citrate was a statistically significant biomarker independent of hormonal treatment status, the current study indicated a potential of glutamine, glutamate and choline as biomarkers for recurrence among patients receiving neoadjuvant hormonal treatment, and glucose among patients not receiving neoadjuvant hormonal treatment.  Conclusion:   Using an integrated approach, our study shows the potential of citrate and the dual upregulation of TOP2A and EZH2 as biomarkers for recurrence among radiotherapy patients.""","""['Ailin Falkmo Hansen', 'Therese Stork Høiem', 'Kirsten Margrete Selnaes', 'Anna Mary Bofin', 'Øystein Størkersen', 'Helena Bertilsson', 'Alan J Wright', 'Guro Fanneløb Giskeødegård', 'Tone Frost Bathen', 'Morten Beck Rye', 'May-Britt Tessem']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""NMR Biomed""","""['TOP2A and EZH2 Provide Early Detection of an Aggressive Prostate Cancer Subgroup.', 'Increased EZH2 expression in prostate cancer is associated with metastatic recurrence following external beam radiotherapy.', 'Multiplex biomarker approach for determining risk of prostate-specific antigen-defined recurrence of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'TOP2A correlates with poor prognosis and affects radioresistance of medulloblastoma.']"""

The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and clinical significance of PTI and the associated management strategies since the implementation of the PSMA PET/CT scan.  Methods:   This study involves a retrospective cohort study of 61 PTI cases depicted on PSMA PET/CT scans performed between January 2016 and July 2021, almost exclusively for (re)staging prostate cancer. The medical records of the included cases were retrospectively reviewed and data of the PSMA PET/CT scans, primary malignancy, thyroid diagnostics, treatment, and follow-up were collected.  Results:   PTI was reported in 1.1% of the patients who underwent oncologic PSMA PET/CT scans included in this study. Two PTI cases had a histologically proven thyroid cancer: one a benign thyroid lesion and one a metastasis of a renal cell carcinoma. In none of the cases in whom any form of further thyroid workup was withheld, the PTI became clinically relevant during follow-up (median 1.8 years (1.1-3.3)). Six patients (10%) died due to their primary cancer.  Conclusion:   The incidence of thyroid incidentalomas on PSMA PET/CT was low (1.1%) in this large, two-center experience. Less than half of the PTI cases were analyzed and the risk of malignancy, despite being low, was not negligible. The clinical outcome was good using a standard diagnostic workup for PTI, while the prognosis of the patient was determined by the primary malignancy. The consideration to analyze and treat PTI cases should be part of the shared decision-making in cancer patients.""","""['Marceline W Piek', 'Lisa H de Vries', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Bart de Keizer', 'Jan Paul de Boer', 'Lutske Lodewijk', 'Rachel S van Leeuwaarde', 'Menno R Vriens', 'Koen J Hartemink', 'Iris M C van der Ploeg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Incidence of PSMA PET thyroid incidentaloma depends on analysis method and tracer.', 'The frequency of thyroid incidental findings and risk of malignancy detected by 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen PET/CT in prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

We have previously reported that EZH2 can act as a transcriptional activator in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Now we show that EZH2 inhibitors can also block the transactivation activity of EZH2 and inhibit the growth of CRPC cells. Gene expression and epigenomics profiling of cells treated with EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated that in addition to derepressing gene expression, these compounds also robustly down-regulate a set of DNA damage repair (DDR) genes, especially those involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Methylation of the pioneer factor FOXA1 by EZH2 contributes to the activation of these genes, and interaction with the transcriptional coactivator P300 via the transactivation domain on EZH2 directly turns on the transcription. In addition, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout screens in the presence of EZH2 inhibitors identified these BER genes as the determinants that underlie the growth-inhibitory effect of EZH2 inhibitors. Interrogation of public data from diverse types of solid tumors expressing wild-type EZH2 demonstrated that expression of DDR genes is significantly correlated with EZH2 dependency and cellular sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors. Consistent with these findings, treatment of CRPC cells with EZH2 inhibitors dramatically enhances their sensitivity to genotoxic stress. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism of action of EZH2 inhibitors and provide a mechanistic basis for potential combination cancer therapies.""","""['Yiji Liao', 'Chen-Hao Chen', 'Tengfei Xiao', 'Bárbara de la Peña Avalos', 'Eloise V Dray', 'Changmeng Cai', 'Shuai Gao', 'Neel Shah', 'Zhao Zhang', 'Avery Feit', 'Pengya Xue', 'Zhijie Liu', 'Mei Yang', 'Ji Hoon Lee', 'Han Xu', 'Wei Li', 'Shenglin Mei', 'Roodolph S Pierre', 'Shaokun Shu', 'Teng Fei', 'Melissa Duarte', 'Jin Zhao', 'James E Bradner', 'Kornelia Polyak', 'Philip W Kantoff', 'Henry Long', 'Steven P Balk', 'X Shirley Liu', 'Myles Brown', 'Kexin Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""[""A cryptic transactivation domain of EZH2 binds AR and AR's splice variant, promoting oncogene activation and tumorous transformation."", 'Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 antagonizes EZH2-mediated CDKN2A repression in carcinogenesis.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'EZH2-Targeted Therapies in Cancer: Hype or a Reality.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Prediction of hub genes and key pathways associated with the radiation response of human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells using integrated bioinformatics methods.', 'Combating castration-resistant prostate cancer by co-targeting the epigenetic regulators EZH2 and HDAC.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.', 'Simultaneous administration of EZH2 and BET inhibitors inhibits proliferation and clonogenic ability of metastatic prostate cancer cells.']"""

The mechanisms of As3+-induced carcinogenesis had been extensively studied, and different mechanisms might be involved in different types of cancer (Wei et al., 2019). Recent studies showed that exposure to a high dose of arsenic is able to induce lung cancer. Meanwhile, prolonged exposure to a low concentration of arsenic can increase the risk of lung cancer also (Liao et al., 2009; Fernández et al., 2012). Emerging evidence indicated that prolonged exposure to arsenic promotes malignant transformation and some of the transformed cells have cancer-stem-like properties (Ngalame et al., 2014). In the present report, we revealed that exposure to As3+ for short time period inhibited tyrosine-705 phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pSTAT3Y705) and induced Src homology region 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) in bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B. In addition, we found that long term exposure of the cells to As3+ activates phosphorylation of STAT3 at serine 727 (pSTAT3S727) as well as pSTAT3Y705. Moreover, As3+ is able to induce the expression of miRNA-21 (miR-21) and decrease the expression of PDCD4. Taken together, our data suggest that activation of STAT3 and induction of miR-21 are important contributing factors to the reduced expression of PDCD4, which may play significant role in As3+-induced transformation of BEAS-2B cells.""","""['Bandar Almutairy', 'Yao Fu', 'Zhuoyue Bi', 'Wenxuan Zhang', 'Priya Wadgaonkar', 'Yiran Qiu', 'Chitra Thakur', 'Fei Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Hexavalent chromium induces malignant transformation of human lung bronchial epithelial cells via ROS-dependent activation of miR-21-PDCD4 signaling.', 'Oncogenic transformation of human lung bronchial epithelial cells induced by arsenic involves ROS-dependent activation of STAT3-miR-21-PDCD4 mechanism.', 'Malignant Transformation of Human Bronchial Epithelial Cells Induced by Arsenic through STAT3/miR-301a/SMAD4 Loop.', 'Arsenic-Induced Carcinogenesis: The Impact of miRNA Dysregulation.', 'Cooperation between NRF2-mediated transcription and MDIG-dependent epigenetic modifications in arsenic-induced carcinogenesis and cancer stem cells.', 'miRNAs and arsenic-induced carcinogenesis.']"""

Main methods:   Prostatic lobes samples from genetic engineered mouse model Ptenf/f and Pb-Cre4/Ptenf/f were submitted for histopathological analysis and tissue expression of AR, the proliferation marker Ki67, alpha-smooth muscle actin, and laminin. RNAseq data of prostatic lobes samples were analyzed searching for MM gene expression patterns. We also investigated gene and protein expression related to MM in human PCa public databases.  Key findings:   All knockout animals analyzed showed at least one area of stroma-invading MM, which was absent in the control animals. The tumoral regions of MM showed a proliferative index 5 times higher than other tumoral areas and low expression of the AR (less than 20% of the cells were AR-positive). Disrupted basement membrane areas were observed in MM. The mouse and human PCa transcriptomes exhibited increased expression of the MM markers such as MUC1, MUC19, MUC4, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and TFF3.

Given the role of HOXB13 germline variation in prostate cancer, we investigated the association between HOXB13 X285K and prostate cancer risk in a large sample of 22 361 African ancestry men, including 11 688 prostate cancer cases. The risk allele was present only in men of West African ancestry, with an allele frequency in men that ranged from 0.40% in Ghana and 0.31% in Nigeria to 0% in Uganda and South Africa, with a range of frequencies in men with admixed African ancestry from North America and Europe (0-0.26%). HOXB13 X285K was associated with 2.4-fold increased odds of prostate cancer (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-3.9, p = 2 × 10-4), with greater risk observed for more aggressive and advanced disease (Gleason ≥8: odds ratio [OR] = 4.7, 95% CI = 2.3-9.5, p = 2 × 10-5; stage T3/T4: OR = 4.5, 95% CI = 2.0-10.0, p = 2 × 10-4; metastatic disease: OR = 5.1, 95% CI = 1.9-13.7, p = 0.001). We estimated that the allele arose in West Africa 1500-4600 yr ago. Further analysis is needed to understand how the HOXB13 X285K variant impacts the HOXB13 protein and function in the prostate. Understanding who carries this mutation may inform prostate cancer screening in men of West African ancestry.

These include distinctive tumors that arise from the specialized prostatic stroma and site-agnostic neoplasms such as smooth muscle tumors, fibrous or myofibroblastic neoplasms, neurogenic tumors, vascular tumors, and a plethora of sarcomas. Select tumors show classic sites of origin within the prostate. While stromal tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMPs) commonly involve the peripheral zone at the prostate base, leiomyomas typically originate from the central prostate toward the apex. Some ""prostatic"" neoplasms such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, solitary fibrous tumor (SFT), paragangliomas, and neurogenic tumors arise primarily from periprostatic soft tissues. Most mesenchymal tumors of the prostate and seminal vesicles manifest as large tumors that cause nonspecific symptoms; prostate-specific antigen level is not typically elevated. Diverse mesenchymal neoplasms demonstrate characteristic histopathologic and immunocytochemical features and variable cross-sectional imaging findings. While leiomyoma and SFT typically display low signal intensity on T2-weighted images, synovial sarcomas commonly show hemorrhage. Diagnosis is difficult because of the rarity and lack of awareness of the tumors and the significant overlap in histopathologic features. Select tumors show characteristic genetic abnormalities that allow the diagnosis to be established. For example, more than 90% of SFTs are characterized by a unique NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion, and more than 95% of synovial sarcomas are associated with a distinctive SYT-SSX chimeric transcript. Accurate diagnosis is imperative for optimal management owing to markedly different tumor biology as well as attendant therapeutic and prognostic implications. While STUMPs commonly recur, sarcomas typically charter an aggressive course with poor prognosis.

Here, we developed three new photosensitizer-based dual-labeled PSMA ligands by crucial modification of existing PSMA ligand backbone structures (PSMA-1007/PSMA-617) for multimodal imaging and targeted PDT of PCa.  Methods:   Various new PSMA ligands were synthesized using solid-phase chemistry and provided with a DOTA chelator for 111In labeling and the fluorophore/photosensitizer IRDye700DX. The performance of three new dual-labeled ligands was compared with a previously published first-generation ligand (PSMA-N064) and a control ligand with an incomplete PSMA-binding motif. PSMA specificity, affinity, and PDT efficacy of these ligands were determined in LS174T-PSMA cells and control LS174T wildtype cells. Tumor targeting properties were evaluated in BALB/c nude mice with subcutaneous LS174T-PSMA and LS174T wildtype tumors using µSPECT/CT imaging, fluorescence imaging, and biodistribution studies after dissection.  Results:   In order to synthesize the new dual-labeled ligands, we modified the PSMA peptide linker by substitution of a glutamic acid into a lysine residue, providing a handle for conjugation of multiple functional moieties. Ligand optimization showed that the new backbone structure leads to high-affinity PSMA ligands (all IC50 < 50 nM). Moreover, ligand-mediated PDT led to a PSMA-specific decrease in cell viability in vitro (P < 0.001). Linker modification significantly improved tumor targeting compared to the previously developed PSMA-N064 ligand (≥ 20 ± 3%ID/g vs 14 ± 2%ID/g, P < 0.01) and enabled specific visualization of PMSA-positive tumors using both radionuclide and fluorescence imaging in mice.

Cancer screening disparities among Muslim Americans are also understudied.  Methods:   To examine differences in cancer screening behaviors based on Muslim affiliation, we analyzed data from a longitudinal cohort study examining lifestyle, healthcare access, environmental, and genetic factors on the health of Chicagoans.  Results:   Of 7552 participants, 132 (1.7%) were Muslim. Between Muslim and non-Muslims, there were no significant differences in prostate, cervical, and breast cancer screening rates, but Muslims were less likely to undergo colorectal cancer screening. When differences in obesity and insurance status were accounted for in a multivariate regression model, religious affiliation was no longer significantly associated with screening rates.  Discussion:   Religious values can influence cancer screening behaviors; hence, tracking cancer screening along religious lines may illuminate previously unknown disparities.

Methods:   Single-center, retrospective cohort study, including 499 biopsy-naïve men at risk for PCa. All men underwent PI-RADS-compliant prostate MRI, transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided targeted (TBx), and systematic biopsy (SBx). Five diagnostic pathways were retrospectively evaluated and compared for. Outcome measures were biopsy avoidance, combined with missed csPCa and detected cisPCa. csPCa and cisPCa were defined as ISUP grade group ≥ 2 and grade = 1, respectively. Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Decision curve analyses were used to compare the benefits of the pathways across a range of biopsy thresholds.  Results:   The prevalence (detection-focused [reference] pathway) of csPCa and cisPCa was 52.9% (264/499) and 23.0% (115/499). MRI-focused pathway (no biopsy in PI-RADS 1-2 men) did not significantly reduce ISUP ≥ 2 cancer detection (52.1% (260/499); p = 0.13), but significantly reduced ISUP 1 cancers diagnosed (20.6% (103/499); p < 0.01), and biopsy avoidance was 11.8% (59/499). The risk-based MRI-directed pathway (no biopsy in low-risk PI-RADS 1-3 men) resulted in a small reduction of ISUP ≥ 2 diagnosed (51.7% (258/499); p = 0.04), however non-significant when compared to MRI-focused pathway (p = 0.625). Moreover, the risk-based pathway further reduced detection of ISUP 1 (18.6% (93/499); p < 0.01), and biopsy avoidance was 19.2% (96/499). Decision curve analysis showed maximized net benefit of the risk-based pathway, for the range of threshold probabilities between 6.25 and 65%.  Conclusion:   The risk-based MRI-directed pathway for prostate cancer diagnosis was optimal in balancing accurate diagnosis, reducing overdiagnosis, and maximizing biopsy avoidance. This substantial evidence should inform guideline recommendations towards using ""risk-based"" MRI-directed biopsy decisions in biopsy-naïve men at risk of significant prostate cancer.  Key points:   • Our study recognizes the added value of prostate MRI and MR-targeted biopsies in order to propose clinical diagnostic pathways for prostate cancer, towards maximizing the potential avoidance of unnecessary biopsies, while maintaining optimal detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer. • The risk-based MRI-directed pathway incorporates risk factors such as PSA density, digital rectal examination, and family history to further refine the initial stratification of patients based on PI-RADS scores. • In this study, the risk-based pathway had the most optimal performance in terms of combination of outcomes, with the highest rate of biopsy avoidance (19.2%), while keeping a high detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer (51.7%), when compared to the reference standard (52.9%).""","""['Leonardo Kayat Bittencourt', 'Karolina Guricova', 'Isaac Zucker', 'Jared C Durieux', 'Ivo G Schoots']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Incorporation of trans-rectal color doppler flow imaging and risk-stratification nomogram reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies in suspected prostate cancer patients: a bi-centered retrospective validation study.', 'Prostate biopsy in the era of MRI-targeting: towards a judicious use of additional systematic biopsy.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Radiotherapy is a potentially curative treatment for localized prostate cancer, and failure to control localized disease contributes to the majority of prostate cancer deaths. Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer, a process by which prostate adenocarcinoma cells transdifferentiate into neuroendocrine-like (NE-like) cells, is an emerging mechanism of resistance to cancer therapies and contributes to disease progression. NED also occurs in response to treatment to promote the development of treatment-induced neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC), a highly aggressive and terminal stage disease. We previously demonstrated that by mimicking clinical radiotherapy protocol, fractionated ionizing radiation (FIR) induces prostate cancer cells to undergo NED in vitro and in vivo. Here, we performed transcriptomic analysis and confirmed that FIR-induced NE-like cells share some features of clinical NEPC, suggesting that FIR-induced NED represents a clinically relevant model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), a master epigenetic regulator of the DNA damage response and a putative oncogene in prostate cancer, along with its cofactors pICln and MEP50, mediate FIR-induced NED. Knockdown of PRMT5, pICln, or MEP50 during FIR-induced NED and sensitized prostate cancer cells to radiation. Significantly, PRMT5 knockdown in prostate cancer xenograft tumors in mice during FIR prevented NED, enhanced tumor killing, significantly reduced and delayed tumor recurrence, and prolonged overall survival. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PRMT5 promotes FIR-induced NED and suggests that targeting PRMT5 may be a novel and effective radiosensitization approach for prostate cancer radiotherapy.""","""['Jake L Owens', 'Elena Beketova#', 'Sheng Liu#', 'Qi Shen', 'Jogendra Singh Pawar', 'Andrew M Asberry', 'Jie Yang', 'Xuehong Deng', 'Bennett D Elzey', 'Timothy L Ratliff', 'Liang Cheng', 'Richard Choo', 'Deborah E Citrin', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Bangchen Wang', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Chenglong Li', 'Jun Wan', 'Chang-Deng Hu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['JNJ-64619178 radiosensitizes and suppresses fractionated ionizing radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting CREB inhibits radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation and increases radiation-induced cell death in prostate cancer cells.', 'Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 Promotes pICln-Dependent Androgen Receptor Transcription in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Neuroendocrine differentiation in prostate cancer: a mechanism of radioresistance and treatment failure.', 'PRMT5: a putative oncogene and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'FOXD1 is associated with poor outcome and maintains tumor-promoting enhancer-gene programs in basal-like breast cancer.', 'Radiogenomic profiling of prostate tumors prior to external beam radiotherapy converges on a transcriptomic signature of TGF-β activity driving tumor recurrence.', 'JNJ-64619178 radiosensitizes and suppresses fractionated ionizing radiation-induced neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) in prostate cancer.', 'SRSF3 and HNRNPH1 Regulate Radiation-Induced Alternative Splicing of Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 5 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Reprogramming landscape highlighted by dynamic transcriptomes in therapy-induced neuroendocrine differentiation.']"""

Methods: Peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis and labeled with 177Lu. Lipophilicity was determined at pH 7.4 (logD 7.4). Receptor-mediated internalization was investigated on PC-3 cells (37°C, 60 min), whereas GRPR affinity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) was determined on both PC-3 and T-47D cells.

Among them, 293 patients were diagnosed with single positive core PCa on biopsy, and the clinical parameters and pathological findings of their radical prostatectomy specimens were analyzed.  Results:   Of the 293 patients, 108 (36.9%) had undergraded Gleason Scores (GS) based on the biopsy. Positive surgical margins (PSMs), perineural invasion (PNI), extracapsular extension (ECE, pT3a) and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI, pT3b) were found in 16.4%, 15.0%, 3.4% and 2.4% of patients, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, we found that preoperative PSA level predict a significant increased risk of upgraded GS and PSMs, and biopsy GS was is a strong predictor of PNI, upgraded GS, tumor stage pT3 at radical prostatectomy.

However, associations between individual-level socio-economic circumstances and cancer survival are relatively poorly understood. Moreover, few studies have addressed contextual effects, where associations between individual-level socio-economic status and cancer survival vary depending on area-based deprivation.  Methods:   Using 9276 individual-level observations from a longitudinal study in England and Wales, we examined the association with cancer survival of area-level deprivation and individual-level occupation, education, and income, for colorectal, prostate and breast cancer patients aged 20-99 at diagnosis. With flexible parametric excess hazard models, we estimated excess mortality across individual-level and area-level socio-economic variables and investigated contextual effects.  Results:   For colorectal cancers, we found evidence of an association between education and cancer survival in men with Excess Hazard Ratio (EHR) = 0.80, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 0.60;1.08 comparing ""degree-level qualification and higher"" to ""no qualification"" and EHR = 0.74 [0.56;0.97] comparing ""apprenticeships and vocational qualification"" to ""no qualification"", adjusted on occupation and income; and between occupation and cancer survival for women with EHR = 0.77 [0.54;1.10] comparing ""managerial/professional occupations"" to ""manual/technical,"" and EHR = 0.81 [0.63;1.06] comparing ""intermediate"" to ""manual/technical"", adjusted on education and income. For breast cancer in women, we found evidence of an association with income (EHR = 0.52 [0.29;0.95] for the highest income quintile compared to the lowest, adjusted on education and occupation), while for prostate cancer, all three individual-level socio-economic variables were associated to some extent with cancer survival. We found contextual effects of area-level deprivation on survival inequalities between occupation types for breast and prostate cancers, suggesting wider individual-level inequalities in more deprived areas compared to least deprived areas. Individual-level income inequalities for breast cancer were more evident than an area-level differential, suggesting that area-level deprivation might not be the most effective measure of inequality for this cancer. For colorectal cancer in both sexes, we found evidence suggesting area- and individual-level inequalities, but no evidence of contextual effects.  Conclusions:   Findings highlight that both individual and contextual effects contribute to inequalities in cancer outcomes.

Consistent and high quality data on the morbidity and mortality impact of a disease represent the key element for this assessment. Being increasingly used in global and national burden of diseases (BoD) studies, the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is an indicator that combines healthy life years lost due to living with disease (Years Lived with Disability; YLD) and due to dying prematurely (Years of Life Lost; YLL). As a step towards a comprehensive national burden of disease study, this study aims to estimate the non-fatal burden of cancer in Belgium using national data.  Methods:   We estimated the Belgian cancer burden from 2004 to 2019 in terms of YLD, using national population-based cancer registry data and international disease models. We developed a microsimulation model to translate incidence- into prevalence-based estimates, and used expert elicitation to integrate the long-term impact of increased disability due to surgical treatment.  Results:   The age-standardized non-fatal burden of cancer increased from 2004 to 2019 by 6 and 3% respectively for incidence- and prevalence-based YLDs. In 2019, in Belgium, breast cancer had the highest morbidity impact among women, followed by colorectal and non-melanoma skin cancer. Among men, prostate cancer had the highest morbidity impact, followed by colorectal and non-melanoma skin cancer. Between 2004 and 2019, non-melanoma skin cancer significantly increased for both sexes in terms of age-standardized incidence-based YLD per 100,000, from 49 to 111 for men and from 15 to 44 for women. Important decreases were seen for colorectal cancer for both sexes in terms of age-standardized incidence-based YLD per 100,000, from 105 to 84 for men and from 66 to 58 for women.  Conclusions:   Breast and prostate cancers represent the greatest proportion of cancer morbidity, while for both sexes the morbidity burden of skin cancer has shown an important increase from 2004 onwards.

Early diagnosis can lead to early treatment and long-term survival. The addition of the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in combination with ultrasound (mpMRI-U/S fusion) biopsy to the existing diagnostic tools improved prostate cancer detection. Use of both tools gradually increases in every day urological practice. Furthermore, advances in the area of information technology and artificial intelligence have led to the development of software platforms able to support clinical diagnosis and decision-making using patient data from personalized medicine.  Methods:   We investigated the current aspects of implementation, architecture, and design of a health care information system able to handle and store a large number of clinical examination data along with medical images, and produce a risk calculator in a seamless and secure manner complying with data security/accuracy and personal data protection directives and standards simultaneously. Furthermore, we took into account interoperability support and connectivity to legacy and other information management systems. The platform was implemented using open source, modern frameworks, and development tools.  Results:   The application showed that software platforms supporting patient follow-up monitoring can be effective, productive, and of extreme value, while at the same time, aiding toward the betterment medicine clinical workflows. Furthermore, it removes access barriers and restrictions to specialized care, especially for rural areas, providing the exchange of medical images and patient data, among hospitals and physicians.  Conclusion:   This platform handles data to estimate the risk of prostate cancer detection using current state-of-the-art in eHealth systems and services while fusing emerging multidisciplinary and intersectoral approaches.

Methods:   Twenty-three patients with prostate cancer were included. A treatment plan with 63 Gy (relative biological effectiveness (RBE)) in 21 fractions was generated using treatment planning computed tomography (CT) images assuming that all patients had high-risk prostate cancer for which the clinical target volume (CTV) needs to include prostate and the seminal vesicle (SV) in our treatment protocol. Twenty-one adaptive treatment plans for each patient (total 483 data sets) were generated using daily CT images, and dose distributions were calculated. Using a 3 mm set-up uncertainty in the robust optimization, the doses to the CTV, prostate, SV, rectum, and bladder were compared.  Results:   Estimated accumulated doses of NART and DART in the 23 patients were 60.81 ± 3.47 Gy (RBE) and 63.24 ± 1.04 Gy (RBE) for CTV D99 (p < 0.01), 62.99 ± 1.28 Gy (RBE) and 63.43 ± 1.33 Gy (RBE) for the prostate D99 (p = 0.2529), and 59.07 ± 5.19 Gy (RBE) and 63.17 ± 1.04 Gy (RBE) for SV D99 (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between NART and DART in the estimated accumulated dose for the rectum and bladder.

High-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE) is a promising alternative ablation modality that utilizes bursts of pulsed electric fields (PEFs) to destroy aberrant cells via targeted membrane damage. Due to its nonthermal mechanism, H-FIRE offers several advantages over state-of-the-art treatments, but waveforms have not been optimized for treatment of PCa. In this study, we characterize lethal electric field thresholds (EFTs) for H-FIRE waveforms with three different pulse widths as well as three interpulse delays in vitro and compare them to conventional irreversible electroporation (IRE). Experiments were performed in non-neoplastic and malignant prostate cells to determine the effect of waveforms on both targeted (malignant) and adjacent (non-neoplastic) tissue. A numerical modeling approach was developed to estimate the clinical effects of each waveform including extent of nonthermal ablation, undesired thermal damage, and nerve excitation. Our findings indicate that H-FIRE waveforms with pulse durations of 5 and 10 μs provide large ablations comparable to IRE with tolerable levels of thermal damage and minimized muscle contractions. Lower duration (2 μs) H-FIRE waveforms exhibit the least amount of muscle contractions but require increased voltages which may be accompanied by unwanted thermal damage.""","""['Kenneth N Aycock#', 'Ram Anand Vadlamani#', 'Edward J Jacobs', 'Khan Mohammad Imran', 'Scott S Verbridge', 'Irving C Allen', 'Navid Manuchehrabadi', 'Rafael V Davalos']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biomech Eng""","""['Asymmetric Waveforms Decrease Lethal Thresholds in High Frequency Irreversible Electroporation Therapies.', 'A Theoretical Argument for Extended Interpulse Delays in Therapeutic High-Frequency Irreversible Electroporation Treatments.', 'High-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE) for non-thermal ablation without muscle contraction.', 'Maximizing Local Access to Therapeutic Deliveries in Glioblastoma.

The resultant data set of NOC-I-RNA fold interactions was mapped to the human transcriptome to define potential bioactive interactions. Interestingly, one of NOC-I's most preferred RNA folds is present in the nuclease processing site in the oncogenic, noncoding microRNA-18a, which NOC-I binds with low micromolar affinity. This affinity for the RNA translates into the selective inhibition of its nuclease processing in vitro and in prostate cancer cells, in which NOC-I also triggers apoptosis.

Procedure:   Prospective cohort of all BP-RMS patients between 2014 and 2019 receiving HDR-BT (iridium-192, 27.5 Gy in five fractions) with/without percutaneous endoscopic polypectomy (PEP) or partial cystectomy (PC). Functional assessment included frequency-volume chart, voided volumes, post-void residual, flow studies, continence status and ultrasound scanning; abnormalities triggered video urodynamics.  Results:   Thirteen patients (10 male), aged 9 months to 4 years (median 23 months), presented with localised fusion-negative embryonal BP-RMS measuring 23-140 mm (median 43 mm) in cranio-caudal extent. After induction chemotherapy, local treatment consisted of PC+BT in three, PEP+BT in four and BT alone in six. At a median 3.5 years (range 21 months to 7 years) follow-up, all were alive without relapse. At a median age of 6 years (4-9 years), the median bladder capacity was 86% (47%-144%) of that expected for age, including 75% (74%-114%) after PC.

A majority of the diagnosed cases does not lead to a lethal disease, and hence biological markers that can distinguish between indolent and fatal forms of the disease are of great importance for guiding treatment decisions. Although over 300 genetic variants are known to be associated with prostate cancer risk, few have been associated with the risk of an aggressive disease. One such variant is rs77559646 located in ANO7. This variant has a dual function. It constitutes a missense mutation in the short isoform of ANO7 and a splice region mutation in full-length ANO7. In this study, we have analyzed the impact of the variant allele of rs77559646 on ANO7 mRNA splicing using a minigene splicing assay and by performing splicing analysis with the tools IRFinder (intron retention finder), rMATS (replicate multivariate analysis of transcript splicing) and LeafCutter on RNA sequencing data from prostate tissue of six rs77559646 variant allele carriers and 43 non-carriers. The results revealed a severe disruption of ANO7 mRNA splicing in rs77559646 variant allele carriers. Immunohistochemical analysis of prostate samples from patients homozygous for the rs77559646 variant allele demonstrated a loss of apically localized ANO7 protein. Our study is the first to provide a mechanistic explanation for the impact of a prostate cancer risk SNP on ANO7 protein production. Furthermore, the rs77559646 variant is the first known germline loss-of-function mutation described for ANO7.

Ageing greatly contributes to sarcopenia as may many other factors such as cancer or androgen deprivation therapies (ADT). This cohort study aims to evaluate (1) the prevalence of muscle disorders and sarcopenia in older patients before initiation of intermediate to high risk prostate cancer treatment with ADT and radiotherapy, and (2) the occurrence and/or aggravation of muscle disorders and sarcopenia at the end of cancer treatment.  Methods:   This cohort study is monocentric and prospective. The primary objectives are to determine the risk factor of sarcopenia prevalence and to study the relationship between ADT and sarcopenia incidence, in patients 70 years and older with histologically proven localized or locally advanced prostate cancer, addressed to a geriatrician (G8 score ≤14) for comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) in Marseille University Hospital. Secondary objectives encompass, measurement of sarcopenia clinical criteria along prostate oncological treatment; evaluation of the quality of life of patients with sarcopenia; evaluation of the impact of socio-behavioral and anthropological factors on sarcopenia evolution and incidence; finally the evaluation of the impact of ADT exposure on sarcopenia. Sarcopenia prevalence was estimated to be between 20 and 30%, therefore the study will enroll 200 patients.  Discussion:   The current guidelines for older patients with prostate cancer recommend a pelvic radiotherapy treatment associated to variable duration (6 to 36 months) of ADT. However ADT impacts muscle mass and could exacerbate the risks of sarcopenia. Our study intends to assess the specific effect of ADT on sarcopenia incidence and/or worsening as well as to estimate sarcopenia prevalence in this population. The results of this cohort trial will lead to a better understanding of sarcopenia prevalence and incidence necessary to further elaborate a prevention plan.

However, its potential tumorigenic mechanism, clinicopathological features, and prognostic outcome have not been systematically described. To determine the pathogenic mechanism, we detected distributions of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), programmed death 1 (PD-1), and cellular components in the tumor microenvironment, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (CD4 and CD8), tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs; CD163 and CD68), and tumor-associated fibroblasts (vimentin and alpha-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA]), in tumor tissues from four patients with primary prostatic SRCC compared with corresponding adjacent tissues and tumor tissues from 30 patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa) by immunohistochemical staining. We found higher expression of PD-L1, CD163, and CD68 in primary SRCC specimens than that in both corresponding adjacent nontumor specimens and PCa specimens with different Gleason scores, indicating that TAMs may participate in the malignant biological behavior of primary SRCC of the prostate. For further analysis, we searched electronic journal databases and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) to identify 200 eligible patients including our four cases. According to Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, patients <68 years old, with radical prostatectomy (RP), Gleason score of 7-8, and lower clinical stage had longer overall survival (OS). Moreover, Cox multivariate analysis indicated that race (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.422), surgical approach (HR = 1.654), and Gleason score (HR = 2.162) were independent prognostic factors for OS.

In total and high metastatic volume groups, hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase were significant factors for predicting overall survival, but both Gleason pattern 5 and primary Gleason pattern 5 did not show a statistically significant difference. In the low-volume metastatic group, the median overall survival in patients with or without primary Gleason pattern 5 was 40 and 78 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, only primary Gleason pattern 5 was an independent predictive factor for overall survival in the low-volume metastatic group (hazard ratio 2.76, 95% confidence interval 1.88-8.67; P = 0.0026).  Conclusion:   The presence of Gleason pattern 5 was not associated with overall survival in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with a Gleason score ≥8. In low-metastatic volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, primary Gleason pattern 5 was a poor prognostic factor, which might show a separate treatment option for this group.""","""['Kento Morozumi', 'Koji Mitsuzuka', 'Shintaro Narita', 'Masahiro Takahashi', 'Sadafumi Kawamura', 'Tatsuo Tochigi', 'Yoichi Arai', 'Senji Hoshi', 'Jiro Shimoda', 'Shigeto Ishidoya', 'Teppei Okamoto', 'Shingo Hatakeyama', 'Toshihiko Sakurai', 'Norihiko Tsuchiya', 'Chikara Ohyama', 'Tomonori Habuchi', 'Akihiro Ito']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Prognostic model with alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and presence of Gleason pattern 5 for worse overall survival in low-risk metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic impact of sarcopenia in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Novel metastatic burden-stratified risk model in de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Contemporary grading for prostate cancer: implications for patient care.']"""

We present world-standardized incidence (WSI) and mortality (WSM) rates for urological cancers for French overseas territories.  Materials and methods:   Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) were calculated for 2008-2014, 2007-2014 and 2010-2014 in Guadeloupe, Martinique and French Guiana.  Results:   For prostate cancer, in Guadeloupe and Martinique, the WSI rates are among the highest in the world (173.0 and 164.5 per 100,000 person-years) and 94.4 in French Guiana. Mortality remains more than twice that observed in mainland France, at 23.0 in Guadeloupe and Martinique, and 16.9 in French Guiana. For bladder cancer, WSI rates were 5.9, 4.9 and 4.1 in men, and 1.9, 1.4 and 1.3 in women, in French Guiana, Guadeloupe and Martinique. WSM rates from bladder varied from 1.5 in French Guiana to 1.8 in Guadeloupe and 2.0 in Martinique in men. In women, it ranges from 0.2 in French Guiana to 0.5 in Guadeloupe and 1.1 in Martinique. Regarding kidney, WSI rates in men are 4.3 in Martinique, 5.2 in Guadeloupe and 6.1 in French Guiana, and 2.3, 2.5 and 3.4, respectively, in women. Mortality rates in men were 1.7 in Guadeloupe, 1.4 in Martinique, and 1.5 in French Guiana, while in women, rates were 0.8 in Guadeloupe and Martinique and 0.6 in French Guiana.

The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Hospital Administration health care system offers a setting of relatively equal access to care in which to assess racial and ethnic disparities in self-identified African American (or Black) veterans and White veterans.  Objective:   To determine the extent of racial and ethnic disparities in the incidence of PCa, clinical stage, and outcomes between African American patients and White patients who received a diagnosis or were treated at a VA hospital.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study included 7 889 984 veterans undergoing routine care in VA hospitals nationwide from 2005 through 2019 (incidence cohort). The age-adjusted incidence of localized and de novo metastatic PCa was estimated. Treatment response was evaluated, and PCa-specific outcomes were compared between African American veterans and White veterans. Residual disparity in PCa outcome, defined as the leftover racial and ethnic disparity in the outcomes despite equal response to treatment, was estimated.  Exposures:   Self-identified African American (or Black) and White race and ethnicity.  Main outcomes and measures:   Time to distant metastasis following PCa diagnosis was the primary outcome. Descriptive analyses were used to compare baseline demographics and clinic characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate race and ethnicity association with pretreatment clinical variables. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate the risk of metastasis.  Results:   Data from 7 889 984 veterans from the incidence cohort were used to estimate incidence, whereas data from 92 269 veterans with localized PCa were used to assess treatment response. Among 92 269 veterans, African American men (n = 28 802 [31%]) were younger (median [IQR], 63 [58-68] vs 65 [62-71] years) and had higher prostate-specific antigen levels (>20 ng/mL) at the time of diagnosis compared with White men (n = 63 467; [69%]). Consistent with US population-level data, African American veterans displayed a nearly 2-fold greater incidence of localized and de novo metastatic PCa compared with White men across VA centers nationwide. Among veterans screened for PCa, African American men had a 29% increased risk of PCa detection on a diagnostic prostate biopsy compared with White (hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.27-1.31; P < .001). African American men who received definitive primary treatment of PCa experienced a lower risk of metastasis (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.95; P < .001). However, African American men who received nondefinitive treatment classified as “other” were more likely to develop metastasis (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.42; P < .001). Using the actual rate of metastasis from veterans who received definitive primary treatment, a persistent residual metastatic burden for African American men was observed across all National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk groups (low risk, 4 vs 2 per 100 000; intermediate risk, 13 vs 6 per 100 000; high risk, 19 vs 9 per 100 000).  Conclusions and relevance:   This cohort analysis found significant disparities in the incidence of localized and metastatic PCa between African American veterans and White veterans. This increased incidence is a major factor associated with the residual disparity in PCa metastasis observed in African American veterans compared with White veterans despite their nearly equal response to treatment.""","""['Kosj Yamoah', 'Kyung Min Lee', 'Shivanshu Awasthi', 'Patrick R Alba', 'Cristina Perez', 'Tori R Anglin-Foote', 'Brian Robison', 'Anthony Gao', 'Scott L DuVall', 'Evangelia Katsoulakis', 'Yu-Ning Wong', 'Sarah C Markt', 'Brent S Rose', 'Ryan Burri', 'Carrie Wang', 'Okoduwa Aboiralor', 'Angelina K Fink', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Julie A Lynch', 'Isla P Garraway']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Errors in Abstract and Results.', 'Comparison by Race of Conservative Management for Low-Risk and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancers in Veterans From 2004 to 2018.', 'Do racial disparities exist in the use of prostate cancer screening and detection tools in veterans?', 'Association of Prostate-Specific Antigen Velocity With Clinical Progression Among African American and Non-Hispanic White Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', 'Mortality Disparities in Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups in the Veterans Health Administration: An Evidence Review and Map.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.', 'Regional disparities of prostate cancer mortality in Ecuador: an examination of trends and correlates from 2004 to 2019.', 'Association of TP53 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with Prostate Cancer in a Racially Diverse Cohort of Men.', 'Complex implementation factors demonstrated when evaluating cost-effectiveness and monitoring racial disparities associated with 18FDCFPyL PET/CT in prostate cancer men.', 'American Indian/Alaska Native men are less likely to receive prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal exams from primary care providers than White men: a secondary analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012-2018.', 'Actionable Genomic Alterations in Prostate Cancer Among Black and White United States Veterans.']"""

The compounds were designed by the amalgamation of structural features of PAC-1 (the first procaspase-3 activator) and oncrasin-1, one potential anticancer agent.  Methods:   The target acetohydrazides (5a-m) were prepared via the Niementowski condensation of anthranilic acid (1a) or 5-substituted-2-aminobenzoic acid (1b-m) and formamide. The compound libraries were evaluated for their cytotoxicity, caspase-3 activation, cell cycle analysis, and apoptosis. In addition, computational chemistry is also performed.  Results:   A biological evaluation revealed that all thirteen compounds designed and synthesized showed strong cytotoxicity against three human cancer cell lines (SW620, colon cancer; PC-3, prostate cancer; NCI-H23, lung cancer) with eight compounds (5a, 5c-i, 5k), which were clearly more potent than both PAC-1 and oncrasin-1. In this series, four compounds, including 5c, 5e, 5f, and 5h, were the most potent members with approximately 4- to 5-fold stronger than the reference compounds PAC-1 and oncrasin-1 in terms of IC50. In comparison to 5-FU, these compounds were even 18- to 29-fold more potent in terms of cytotoxicity in three human cell lines tested. In the caspase activation assay, the caspase activity was activated to 285% by compound 5e compared to PAC-1, the first procaspase activating compound, which was used as a control. Our docking simulation revealed that compound 5e was a potent allosteric inhibitor of procaspase-3 through chelation of inhibitory zinc ion. Physicochemical and ADMET calculations for 5e provided useful information of its suitable absorption profile and some toxicological effects that need further optimization to be developed as a promising anticancer agent.  Conclusion:   Compound 5e has emerged as a potential hit for further design and development of caspases activators and anticancer agents.""","""['Do Thi Mai Dung', 'Eun Jae Park', 'Duong Tien Anh', 'Pham-The Hai', 'Le Quang Bao', 'A Young Ji', 'Jong Soon Kang', 'Truong Thanh Tung', 'Sang-Bae Han', 'Nguyen-Hai Nam']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""[""Design, synthesis, and evaluation of novel (E)-N'-(3-allyl-2-hydroxy)benzylidene-2-(4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)acetohydrazides as antitumor agents."", 'Novel 3,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinazoline-based acetohydrazides: Design, synthesis and evaluation of antitumor cytotoxicity and caspase activation activity.', ""(E)-N'-Arylidene-2-(4-oxoquinazolin-4(3H)-yl) acetohydrazides: Synthesis and evaluation of antitumor cytotoxicity and caspase activation activity."", 'New Acetohydrazides Incorporating 2-Oxoindoline and 4-Oxoquinazoline: Synthesis and Evaluation of Cytotoxicity and Caspase Activation Activity.', ""N'-(E)-Arylidene-2-(2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-4H-1,4-benzoxazin-4-yl)-acetohydrazides: Synthesis and Evaluation of Caspase Activation Activity and Cytotoxicity.""]"""

Amongst potential molecular biomarkers, microRNAs (miRs) have attracted particular interest because of their high stability in body fluids and fixed tissues. These small non-coding RNAs modulate several physiological and pathological processes, including cancer progression. Herein we explore the prognostic potential and the functional role of miRs in localised PCa and their relation to nodal metastasis. We define a 7-miR signature that is associated with poor survival independently of age, Gleason score, pathological T state, N stage and surgical margin status and that is also prognostic for disease-free survival in patients with intermediate-risk localised disease. Within our 7-miR signature, we show that miR-378a-3p (hereafter miR-378a) levels are low in primary tumours compared to benign prostate tissue, and also lower in Gleason score 8-9 compared to Gleason 6-7 PCa. We demonstrate that miR-378a impairs glucose metabolism and reduces proliferation in PCa cells through independent mechanisms, and we identify glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) messenger RNA as a direct target of miR-378a. We show that GLUT1 inhibition hampers glycolysis, leading to cell death. Our data provides a rational for a new PCa stratification strategy based on miR expression, and it reveals that miR-378a and GLUT1 are potential therapeutic targets in highly aggressive glycolytic PCa.""","""['A Cannistraci#', 'P Hascoet#', 'A Ali', 'P Mundra', 'N W Clarke', 'V Pavet', 'R Marais']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Depicting the Implication of miR-378a in Cancers.', 'Circle RNA hsa_circRNA_100290 serves as a ceRNA for miR-378a to regulate oral squamous cell carcinoma cells growth via Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1) and glycolysis.', 'Tumor-derived miR-378a-3p-containing extracellular vesicles promote osteolysis by activating the Dyrk1a/Nfatc1/Angptl2 axis for bone metastasis.', 'Circular RNA_PDHX Promotes the Proliferation and Invasion of Prostate Cancer by Sponging MiR-378a-3p.', 'miR-378a: a new emerging microRNA in metabolism.', 'Metabolic reprogramming and epigenetic modifications in cancer: from the impacts and mechanisms to the treatment potential.', 'MiR-122-5p regulates the mevalonate pathway by targeting p53 in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Metabolic reprogramming by miRNAs in the tumor microenvironment: Focused on immunometabolism.', 'Depicting the Implication of miR-378a in Cancers.']"""

The aims were (1) to establish whether toxicity rates differed from those of a control group with normal hips, (2) to develop a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) approach for patients with prostheses and (3) to compare doses to bladder and rectum for the control group, prostheses group and VMAT replans for the prostheses group.  Methods:   Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was scored using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0. The incidence of grade 2 or worse (G2+) toxicity was compared using Fisher's exact test. Dose volume histograms (DVHs) and mean doses to organs at risk (OARs) were compared using signed rank tests.  Results:   There were 17 patients in the prostheses group and 50 in the control group. Acute and late GU toxicity was similar. G2+ late GI toxicity incidence was 31% for the prostheses group and 14% for the control group (p = 0.14). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were seen between the OAR DVHs of the prostheses group who had IMRT and the control group for a range of intermediate doses. The rectum mean dose was significantly different (p < 0.001), but no difference was seen for the bladder mean dose (p = 0.08).

Methods:   Patients with a previously treated PC who underwent rectal resection from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively included. Outcomes were compared between patients who underwent rectal resection with anastomosis (restorative surgery, RS+ group) and those with a definitive stoma (RS- group). In the RS+ group, anastomotic leak (AL) rates were assessed according to the type of reconstruction.  Results:   A total of 126 patients underwent rectal surgery for mid-low RC after a previous PC treated by radiotherapy (RT) and/or radical prostatectomy. Overall, 80 patients (63%) underwent a RS and 46 patients (37%) underwent rectal surgery with a definitive stoma. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in terms of intraoperative data, except for the type of resection with more multivisceral resection in the RS- group (p < 0.01). In the RS+group, a diverting stoma was performed in 74% of cases. No difference between the two groups in terms of overall morbidity was found. In the RS+group (n = 80), 17 patients (21%) experienced AL. Of these, none was observed when delayed coloanal anastomosis was performed (p = 0.16). Long-term permanent stoma in the RS+ group was 16% (n = 13).

Purpose:   To evaluate the value of T2 mapping to detect prostate cancer (PCa) and to differentiate PCa aggressiveness.  Study type:   Retrospective single center cohort study.  Population:   Forty-four consecutive patients (mean age 67 years; median PSA 7.9 ng/mL) with mpMRI and verified PCa by subsequent targeted plus systematic MR/ultrasound (US)-fusion biopsy from February 2019 to December 2019.  Field strength/sequence:   Standardized mpMRI at 3 T with an additionally acquired T2 mapping sequence.  Assessment:   Primary endpoint was the analysis of quantitative T2 values and contrast differences/ratios (CD/CR) between PCa and benign tissue. Secondary objectives were the correlation between T2 values, ISUP grade, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, and PI-RADS, and the evaluation of thresholds for differentiating PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa).  Statistical tests:   Mann-Whitney test, Spearman's rank (rs ) correlation, receiver operating curves, Youden's index (J), and AUC were performed. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05.  Results:   Median quantitative T2 values were significantly lower for PCa in PZ (85 msec) and PCa in TZ (75 msec) compared to benign PZ (141 msec) or TZ (97 msec) (P < 0.001). CD/CR between PCa and benign PZ (51.2/1.77), respectively TZ (19.8/1.29), differed significantly (P < 0.001). The best T2 -mapping threshold for PCa/csPCa detection was for TZ 81/86 msec (J = 0.929/1.0), and for PZ 110 msec (J = 0.834/0.905). Quantitative T2 values of PCa did not correlate significantly with the ISUP grade (rs = 0.186; P = 0.226), ADC value (rs = 0.138; P = 0.372), or PI-RADS (rs = 0.132; P = 0.392).  Data conclusion:   Quantitative T2 values could differentiate PCa in TZ and PZ and might support standardization of mpMRI of the prostate. Different thresholds seem to apply for PZ and TZ lesions.

In this study, we demonstrated a novel strategy to construct negatively charged and ultrasound (US)-responsive O-carboxymethyl chitosan (O-CMS) NDs as a siRNA targeted delivery system through three-way junction of bacteriophage phi29 DNA packaging motor (3WJ-pRNA) nanotechnology. 39nt A10-3.2 aptamer targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and 21nt siRNA against cationic amino acid transporter 1 (siCAT-1) were annealed to 3WJ-pRNA scaffold via complementation with an extended sequence. The cholesterol molecule attached to one branch facilitates the 3WJ-pRNA nanoparticles anchoring onto NDs. The desired O-CMS NDs with siRNA-loading and RNA-aptamer modification (A10-3.2/siCAT-1/3WJ-NDs) were successfully prepared, which were with spherical shapes, core-shell structures and uniform in sizes (198 nm with PDI 0.3).

Abiraterone, an inhibitor of the steroidogenic enzyme CYP17A1, has been demonstrated to reduce adrenal androgen synthesis and prolong CRPC patient survival. To study mechanisms of resistance to castration and abiraterone, we created coculture models using human prostate and adrenal tumours.  Materials and methods:   Castration-naïve and CRPC clones of VCaP were incubated with steroid substrates or cocultured with human adrenal cells (H295R) and treated with abiraterone or the antiandrogen enzalutamide. Male mice bearing VCaP xenografts with and without concurrent H295R xenografts were castrated and treated with placebo or abiraterone. Response was assessed by tumour growth and PSA release. Plasma and tumour steroid levels were assessed by LC/MS-MS. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined steroidogenic enzyme, nuclear receptor and AR target gene expression.  Results:   In vitro, adrenal androgens induced castration-naïve and CRPC cell growth, while precursors steroids for de novo synthesis did not. In a coculture system, abiraterone blocked H295R-induced growth of VCaP cells. In vivo, H295R promoted castration-resistant VCaP growth. Abiraterone only inhibited VCaP growth or PSA production in the presence of H295R. Plasma steroid levels demonstrated CYP17A1 inhibition by abiraterone, whilst CRPC tumour tissue steroid levels showed no evidence of de novo intratumoural androgen production. Castration-resistant and abiraterone-resistant VCaP tumours had increased levels of AR, AR variants and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) resulting in equal AR target gene expression levels compared to noncastrate tumours.  Conclusions:   In our model, ligand-dependent AR-regulated regrowth of CRPC was predominantly supported via adrenal androgen precursor production while there was no evidence for intratumoural androgen synthesis.

We propose a site-agnostic, three-dimensional dose distribution prediction model using deep learning that can leverage data from any treatment site, thus increasing the total data available to train the model. Applying our proposed model to a new target treatment site requires only a brief fine-tuning of the model to the new data and involves no modifications to the model input channels or its parameters. Thus, it can be efficiently adapted to a different treatment site, even with a small training dataset.  Methods:   This study uses two separate datasets/treatment sites: data from patients with prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (source data), and data from patients with head-and-neck cancer treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy (target data). We first developed a source model with 3D UNet architecture, trained from random initial weights on the source data. We evaluated the performance of this model on the source data. We then studied the generalizability of the model to the new target dataset via transfer learning. To do this, we built three more models, all with the same 3D UNet architecture: target model, adapted model, and combined model. The source and target models were trained on the source and target data from random initial weights, respectively. The adapted model fine-tuned the source model to the target domain by using the target data. Finally, the combined model was trained from random initial weights on a combined data pool consisting of both target and source datasets. We tested all four models on the target dataset and evaluated quantitative dose-volume histogram metrics for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs).  Results:   When tested on the source treatment site, the source model accurately predicted the dose distributions with average (mean, max) absolute dose errors of (0.32%±0.14, 2.37%±0.93) (PTV) relative to the prescription dose, and highest mean dose error of 1.68%±0.76, and highest max dose error of 5.47%± 3.31 for femoral head right. The error in PTV dose coverage prediction is 3.21%±1.51 for D98 , 3.04%±1.69 for D95 , and 1.83%±1.01 for D02 . Averaging across all OARs, the source model predicted the OAR mean dose within 1.38% and the OAR max dose within 3.64%. For the target treatment site, the target model average (mean, max) absolute dose errors relative to the prescription dose for the PTV were (1.08%±0.95, 2.90%±1.35). Left cochlea had the highest mean and max dose errors of 5.37%±5.82 and 8.33%±8.88, respectively. The errors in PTV dose coverage prediction for D98 and D95 were 2.88%±1.59 and 2.55%±1.28, respectively.

Patients and methods:   From November 2012 to September 2021, a total of 237 patients underwent RP at our institution. Blood samples from all patients were collected within 1 week before surgery. Preoperative clinical characteristics include age, serum IL-6 and TNF-α, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein, the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, systemic immune-inflammation index, the prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score, prostate-specific antigen, and biopsy GS were assessed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyzes were used to determine the risk factors of GS changes after RP. The efficiency of this prediction model was identified with the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve.  Results:   Seventy-three patients (30.8%) had GS upgraded in the overall cohort, and 55 patients (23.2%) had GS downgraded. In comparing PCa patients with and without GS upgraded, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum TNF-α (odds ratio [OR]: 2.518, p = 0.019) and IL-6 (OR: 0.478, p = 0.023) were independent factors predicting the occurrence of GS upgrade. We also compared the characteristics of patients with GS upgraded and GS downgraded; multivariate logistic regression analysis also demonstrated significant differences in serum IL-6 and TNF-α between these two groups (all p < 0.05). In addition, we found that low prostate volume and biopsy GS ≥ 7 were significantly associated with higher PI-RADS sores in multivariate analysis.  Conclusion:   The high expression of serum TNF-α level is positively correlated with GS upgraded in PCa patients. High expression of serum IL-6 level is negatively correlated with GS upgraded in PCa patients and positively related with GS downgraded.""","""['Jiatong Zhou', 'Haojie Chen', 'Yanyuan Wu', 'Bowen Shi', 'Jie Ding', 'Jun Qi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Analysis of risk factors for Gleason score upgrading after radical prostatectomy in a Chinese cohort.', 'Role of PI-RADS Version 2 for Prediction of Upgrading in Biopsy-Proven Prostate Cancer With Gleason Score 6.', 'Upgrading and downgrading of prostate cancer from biopsy to radical prostatectomy: incidence and predictive factors using the modified Gleason grading system and factoring in tertiary grades.', 'Role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to predict postoperative Gleason score upgrading in prostate cancer with Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Improving Whole Tomato Transformation for Prostate Health: Benign Prostate Hypertrophy as an Exploratory Model.', 'The tumor innate immune microenvironment in prostate cancer: an overview of soluble factors and cellular effectors.', 'Serum multi-cytokines screening identifies TRAIL and IL-10 as probable new biomarkers for prostate health index diagnostic utility adjustment in grey zone aggressive prostate cancer detection: A single-center data in China.']"""

Methods:   A search was conducted of the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science databases identifying studies reporting on the risk of rectal cancer following prostatic radiotherapy. Studies must have included an appropriate control group of non-irradiated prostate cancer patients. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the risk of prostatic radiotherapy on subsequent rectal cancer diagnosis.  Results:   In total, 4757 articles were screened with eight studies meeting the predetermined criteria. A total of 796,386 patients were included in this meta-analysis which showed an increased odds ratio (OR) for subsequent rectal cancer in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy compared to those treated by non-radiotherapy means (OR 1.45, 1.07-1.97, p = 0.02).  Conclusion:   These findings confirm that prostate radiotherapy significantly increases the risk of subsequent rectal cancer.

Methods:   A total of 314 FPB were prospectively collected from two different centers. All patients were biopsy naïve and all mpMRI reported a single suspicious area. Overall, 211 PB were performed using a RF system and 103 using an EF software. The two groups were compared for the main clinical features. A 1:1 PSM analysis was employed to reduce covariate imbalance to < 10%. Detection rate (DR) for any prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant (cs) PCa were compared and stratified for PI-RADS Score. A per target univariable and multivariable regression analyses were applied to identity predictors of anyPCa and csPCa.  Results:   After applying the PSM, two cohorts of 83 cases were selected. DR of any PCa cancer and csPCa were comparable between the two cohorts (all p > 0.077) as well as DR of csPCa for every PIRADS score. At univariable regression analysis lesion size, PI-RADS Score, PSA Density and EF system were predictors of any PCa (all p < 0.001); however, at multivariable analysis only PI-RADS Score was independent predictor of any PCa (p = 0.027).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to appraise the detailed expression profile of CASC5 in patients with UBC. The mRNA over expression of CASC5 was detected in testis tissue and relatively high frequency 59.2% (45 of 76) of CASC5 mRNA was detected in UBC tissues. CASC5 mRNA relative mean fold expression was also significantly (p < 0.01) higher in the muscle-invasive tumor tissues compared to non-muscle-invasive tumor tissues (12.26 ± 9.53 vs. 4.64 ± 2.50, p = 0.005). Heterogeneous staining pattern of CASC5 protein was exclusively detected using IHC. The frequency of CASC5 protein over expression was detected in 67.7% (44 of 65) UBC patients and negative in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

Short-term exercise during ADT has proven to be safe and effective in exhibiting a positive impact on body composition, sexual dysfunction and fatigue. However, there are only three randomized controlled trials that investigate one-year supervised impact exercise interventions, none of which examined follow-up effects after the intervention. Therefore, this study will conduct a one-year impact exercise intervention and assess follow-up effects up to one year later.  Material and methods:   The aim of the randomized, controlled Burgdorf study is to assess the effects of a supervised 12-month intensive multimodal exercise intervention in comparison to a moderate aerobic exercise intervention, on muscle strength in prostate cancer patients receiving ADT. Additionally, quality of life, fatigue, body composition, erectile dysfunction, bone pain, physical activity level, endurance capacity, body-mass-index, waist and hip circumference and prostate-specific antigen- and testosterone levels will be assessed up to one year later.  Discussion:   The Burgdorf study is the first study to conduct two different one-year supervised exercise interventions, and follow-up with patients for up to one year after the intervention.

Here, with the hypothesis that 6-, 7- and 8-geranyloxycarbostyril (GQ) have inhibitory properties on 15-LOX-1, their effects were assessed on PCa cells. Their cytotoxic effects were evaluated by MTT assay and mechanism of cell death was investigated using annexin V/PI staining. Finally, the anti-tumor properties of 8-GQ were assessed in immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice bearing human PCa cells. Accordingly, these compounds could effectively inhibit 15-LOX activity in PCa cells. MTT and flow cytometry tests confirmed their toxic effects on PCa cells, with no significant toxicity on normal cells, and apoptosis was the main mechanism of cell death. In vivo results indicated that use of 8-GQ at 50 mg/kg had stronger anti-tumor effects than 5 mg/kg cisplatin, with fewer side effects on normal tissues.

To address this, uEV excretion was measured before and after human kidney donor nephrectomy and rat nephrectomy. In male and female donors, uEVs were quantified in cell-free spot and 24-h urine samples using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), EVQuant, and CD9-time-resolved fluorescence immunoassay. Female donors had significantly lower total kidney volume (TKV) and excreted 49% fewer uEVs than male donors. uEV excretion correlated positively with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), creatinine clearance, and TKV (R's between 0.6 and 0.7). uEV excretion rate could also be predicted from spot urines after multiplying spot uEV/creatinine by 24-h urine creatinine. Donor nephrectomy reduced eGFR by 36% ± 10%, but the excretion of uEVs by only 16% (CD9+ uEVs -37%, CD9- uEVs no decrease). Donor nephrectomy increased the podocyte marker WT-1 and the proximal tubule markers NHE3, NaPi-IIa, and cubilin in uEVs two- to four-fold when correcting for the nephrectomy. In rats, the changes in GFR and kidney weight correlated with the changes in uEV excretion rate (R = 0.46 and 0.60, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the estimated degree of hypertrophy matched the change in uEV excretion rate (1.4- to 1.5-fold after uninephrectomy and four-fold after 5/6th nephrectomy). Taken together, our data show that uEV excretion depends on nephron mass, and that nephrectomy reduces uEV excretion less than expected based on nephron loss due to compensatory hypertrophy.

We identified a novel interaction between two kinases: tousled-like kinase 1 (TLK1) and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 5 (MK5) that promotes PCa spread. In PCa progression, TLK1-MK5 signalling appears to increase following antiandrogen treatment and in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Determinations of motility rates (2D and 3D) of different TLK1- and MK5-perturbed cells, including knockout (KO) and knockdown (KD), as well as the use of specific inhibitors, showed the importance of these two proteins for in vitro dissemination. We established that TLK1 phosphorylates MK5 on three residues (S160, S354 and S386), resulting in MK5 activation, and additionally, mobility shifts of MK5 also supported its phosphorylation by TLK1 in transfected HEK 293 cells. Expression of MK5-S354A or kinase-dead MK5 in MK5-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells failed to restore their motility compared with that of wild-type (WT) MK5-rescued MK5-/- MEF cells. A pMK5-S354 antiserum was used to establish this site as an authentic TLK1 target in androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) cells, and was used in immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies of age-related PCa sections from TRAMP (transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate) mice and to probe a human tissue microarray (TMA), which revealed pMK5-S354 level is correlated with disease progression (Gleason score and nodal metastases). In addition, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analyses of PCa expression and genome-wide association study (GWAS) relations identify TLK1 and MK5 as potential drivers of advanced PCa and as markers of mCRPC. Our work suggests that TLK1-MK5 signalling is functionally involved in driving PCa cell motility and clinical features of aggressiveness; hence, disruption of this axis may inhibit the metastatic spread of PCa.""","""['Md Imtiaz Khalil', 'Vibha Singh', 'Judy King', 'Arrigo De Benedetti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Oncol""","""['The TLK1-MK5 Axis Regulates Motility, Invasion, and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Tousled-like kinase 1: a novel factor with multifaceted role in mCRPC progression and development of therapy resistance.', 'The TLK1-Nek1 axis promotes prostate cancer progression.', 'MK5 haplodeficiency decreases collagen deposition and scar size during post-myocardial infarction wound repair.', 'New insights into the activation, interaction partners and possible functions of MK5/PRAK.', 'Targeting TLK2 inhibits the progression of gastric cancer by reprogramming amino acid metabolism through the mTOR/ASNS axis.', ""Targeting Prostate Cancer, the 'Tousled Way'."", 'NEK1-Mediated Phosphorylation of YAP1 Is Key to Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'The TLK1-MK5 Axis Regulates Motility, Invasion, and Metastasis of Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Here we explored how sleep hygiene behaviours and psychological symptoms are associated with insomnia symptoms in PCa patients.  Methods:   An online survey was posted on social media and sent to mailing lists of PCa and general cancer organisations. The survey collected information on demographic, sleep hygiene, and psychological symptoms using validated questionnaires.  Results:   Data from 142 participants were compared based on the absence (age = 68.3 ± 8.9 years) and presence (age = 66.6 ± 9.0 years) of insomnia symptoms. Participants with insomnia symptoms had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleepiness as well as poorer sleep hygiene than those without insomnia symptoms. Control variables (age, number of comorbidities, and BMI) accounted for 11.9% of the variance in insomnia symptoms. Including treatment history contributed to an additional 1.6% of the variance in insomnia symptoms. Adding sleepiness, fatigue, anxiety, and depressive symptoms to the model explained an additional 44.6% of the variance in insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, including the sleep hygiene item 'I think, plan, or worry when I am in bed' and 'I sleep in an uncomfortable bedroom' explained an additional 3.6% of the variance in insomnia symptoms.

Evidence shows that genetic and environmental factors both contribute to the development of prostate cancer. It is well known that melatonin plays a protective role in prostate cancer. Melatonin receptor 1B gene (MTNR1B) rs10830963 influences the dynamics of melatonin secretion, and night shift work, which disrupts our internal circadian rhythms, also dysregulates the production of melatonin. Therefore, we aimed to examine the interaction between night shift work and rs10830963 polymorphism on prostate cancer.  Methods:   This is a prospective cohort study based on UK Biobank that included 133,416 employed male participants. Exposures included night shift work and rs10830963 polymorphism. The primary outcome was the incidence of prostate cancer. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate the association of night shift work and MTNR1B rs10830963 with prostate cancer.  Results:   A significant interaction was found between night shift work and MTNR1B rs10830963 on the incidence of prostate cancer (P = 0.009). Among non-night shift workers, rs10830963 polymorphism was not significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer. Among night shift workers, compared with CC carriers, GC carriers had a significantly lower risk of prostate cancer [HR: 0.69; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.93], and similar associations were more evident for GG carriers (HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.15-0.75).  Conclusions:   Compared with MTNR1B rs10830963 CC, carrying allele G may reduce the risk of prostate cancer when exposed to night shift work.

Most CAP proteins are secreted glycoproteins and share a unique conserved αβα sandwich fold. The precise mode of action of this class of proteins, however, has remained elusive. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three CAP family members, termed pathogen related in yeast (Pry). We have previously shown that Pry1 and Pry2 export sterols in vivo and that they bind sterols in vitro. This sterol binding and export function of yeast Pry proteins is conserved in the mammalian CRISP proteins and other CAP superfamily members. CRISP3 is an abundant protein of the human seminal plasma and interacts with prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP94), another major protein component in the seminal plasma. Here we examine whether the interaction between CRISP proteins and PSP94 affects the sterol binding function of CAP family members. We show that coexpression of PSP94 with CAP proteins in yeast abolished their sterol export function and the interaction between PSP94 and CAP proteins inhibits sterol binding in vitro. In addition, mutations that affect the formation of the PSP94-CRISP2 heteromeric complex restore sterol binding. Of interest, we found the interaction of PSP94 with CRISP2 is sensitive to high calcium concentrations. The observation that PSP94 modulates the sterol binding function of CRISP2 in a calcium-dependent manner has potential implications for the role of PSP94 and CRISP2 in prostate physiology and progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Ola El Atab', 'Aslihan Ekim Kocabey', 'Oluwatoyin A Asojo', 'Roger Schneiter']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['The CAP protein superfamily: function in sterol export and fungal virulence.', 'Pathogen-Related Yeast (PRY) proteins and members of the CAP superfamily are secreted sterol-binding proteins.', 'The pathogen-related yeast protein Pry1, a member of the CAP protein superfamily, is a fatty acid-binding protein.', 'The function of yeast CAP family proteins in lipid export, mating, and pathogen defense.', 'Structural and molecular biology of PSP94: Its significance in prostate pathophysiology.', 'Peptidase inhibitor (PI16) impairs bladder cancer metastasis by inhibiting NF-κB activation via disrupting multiple-site ubiquitination of NEMO.', 'The function of plant PR1 and other members of the CAP protein superfamily in plant-pathogen interactions.']"""

Outcome analysis revealed a significant difference in the risk of biochemical recurrence after RP between cases with and without PNI on T-Bx (P = 0.021). Next, in the 135 B-Bx cases, PNI was found on S-Bx only (n = 31), T-Bx only (n = 15), or B-Bx (n = 16). Compared with PNI on S-Bx, B-Bx PNI was associated with higher preoperative prostate-specific antigen, higher biopsy GG, higher pT stage, and larger tumor volume. There were no significant differences in any of the clinicopathologic features examined between cases with PNI on T-Bx only vs. B-Bx. Moreover, in this subgroup of patients, PNI on B-Bx was associated with significantly higher risks of biochemical recurrence, compared with PNI on S-Bx only (P = 0.024) or T-Bx only (P = 0.033). In multivariate analysis, PNI on B-Bx showed significance for recurrence (hazard ratio = 2.787, P = 0.034).

Methods:   This is a planned exploratory analysis of 130 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer grade group 2 or greater enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (NCT02333435) testing the effects of LCω3, on prostate cancer biological and pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy as main outcomes. The LCω3 intervention (MAG-EPA 3 g daily) or equivalent placebo was given 4-10 weeks prior to radical prostatectomy. An intention-to-treat analysis approach was used with bi-variate statistical testing of bleeding and complications outcomes. We also estimated the difference between groups using linear regression and non-parametric quantile regression models. All models were adjusted for confounding variables selected on clinical relevance.  Results:   We found no clinically significant effect of LCω3 versus placebo on perioperative bleeding, laboratory tests or postoperative complications. In contrast, as expected, we found a significant increase in perioperative bleeding in open retropubic radical prostatectomy compared to robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (adjusted difference 115.8 mL, p = 0.04).

In this study, we present a microfluidic system and the associated equivalent circuit models for real-time measurements of cell membrane capacitance and cytoplasm resistance in physiological buffers with 10 s increments. The current device captures several hundreds of biological cells in individual microwells through gravitational settling and measures the system's impedance using microelectrodes covered with dendritic gold nanostructures. Using PC-3 cells (a highly metastatic prostate cancer cell line) suspended in cell growth media (CGM), we demonstrate stable measurements of cell membrane capacitance and cytoplasm resistance in the device for over 15 min. We also describe a consistent application of the equivalent circuit model, starting from the reference measurements used to determine the system parameters. The circuit model is tested using devices with varying dimensions, and the obtained cell parameters between different devices are nearly identical. Further analyses of the impedance data have shown that accurate cell membrane capacitance and cytoplasm resistance can be extracted using a limited number of measurements in the 5 MHz to 10 MHz range. This will potentially reduce the timescale required for real-time DS measurements below 1 s.

Sex hormones have been implicated in relation to chronotype and the development of both cancers. This study aimed to assess whether sex hormones confound or mediate the effect of chronotype on breast and prostate cancer using a Mendelian Randomization (MR) framework. Genetic variants associated with chronotype and sex hormones (total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, and oestradiol) (p<5×10-8) were obtained from published genome-wide association studies (n≤244,207 females and n≤205,527 males). These variants were used to investigate causal relationships with breast (nCases/nControls = 133,384/113,789) and prostate (nCases/nControls = 79,148/61,106) cancer using univariable, bidirectional and multivariable MR. In females, we found evidence for: I) Reduced risk of breast cancer per category increase in morning-preference (OR = 0.93, 95% CI:0. 88, 1.00); II) Increased risk of breast cancer per SD increase in bioavailable testosterone (OR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.19) and total testosterone (OR = 1.15, 95% CI:1.07, 1.23); III) Bidirectional effects between morning-preference and both bioavailable and total testosterone (e.g. mean SD difference in bioavailable testosterone = -0.08, 95% CI:-0.12, -0.05 per category increase in morning-preference vs difference in morning-preference category = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.08, 0.00 per SD increase in bioavailable testosterone). In males, we found evidence for: I) Reduced risk of prostate cancer per category increase in morning-preference (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.97) and II) Increased risk of prostate cancer per SD increase in bioavailable testosterone (OR = 1.22, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.37). No bidirectional effects were found between morning-preference and testosterone in males.

Based on the predictions, an MCO problem is subsequently constructed using previously developed dose mimicking functions, designed in such a way that its Pareto surface spans the range of clinically acceptable yet realistically achievable plans as exactly as possible.

To gain insights into potential biological mechanisms we explored differences in serum concentrations of sex hormones and IGFs across the trajectory from normoglycemia to prediabetes to poorly controlled diabetes.  Methods:   Using cross-sectional data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III we examined differences in levels of circulating sex hormones, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), IGF-1, and IFG-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), according to diabetes status: no diabetes [n = 648], prediabetes [n = 578], undiagnosed diabetes [n = 106], well-controlled diabetes [n = 42], and poorly controlled diabetes [n = 56]. Adjusted geometric mean concentrations were derived using multivariable linear regression, adjusted for age, race, and other lifestyle factors.  Results:   Total testosterone concentrations were lower among prediabetics (4.89 ng/mL, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.95-5.21) than men without prediabetes/diabetes (5.29 ng/mL, 95% CI 5.06-5.53) but did not reduce further across diabetes groups. Concentrations of estradiol, estimated free testosterone, SHGB, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 did not differ. While the ratio of IGF-1 to IGFBP-3 was lower among men with prediabetics and undiagnosed diabetes than men without prediabetes/diabetes, there was no trend across groups. A positive trend for the ratio of estradiol-to-testosterone levels was observed across groups (p trend = 0.045).

Additionally, exosomes (EVs) isolated from PC3 cells have no effect on PC3 cells. This is also true for exosomes (EVs) isolated from H2O2-induced senescent human lung cancer cells (A549). Analysis of exosome (EVs) content by western blotting reveals the presence of PTEN in the exosome (EVs) of lung cancer cells. Functional analysis of PTEN pathways in PC3 cells indicates the inactivation of Akt in exosome (EV)-treated cells.

AR is presently the main target for treating prostate cancer. Clinically approved AR antagonists compete with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of AR, and patients eventually develop resistance to these treatments. One approach to overcoming resistance is to discover compounds that inhibit AR in alternative ways. Our lab previously identified a small molecule, JJ-450, that is capable of inhibiting AR lacking LBD. To optimize the efficacy of this class of inhibitors, we developed structural analogues of JJ-450 and identified (+)-JJ-74-138 as a promising candidate. Here, we show that (+)-JJ-74-138 is more potent than JJ-450 in the inhibition of androgen-independent AR activity in enzalutamide-resistant LN95 cells. Further studies showed (+)-JJ-74-138 inhibition of castration-resistant PSA expression in all tested castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. (+)-JJ-74-138 inhibited mRNA expression of AR and ARv7 target genes and reduced AR level in the nucleus in the absence of androgens. Also, this analogue noncompetitively inhibited androgen-stimulated AR activity in C4-2, LN95, and 22Rv1 CRPC cells. At low dosages, (+)-JJ-74-138 inhibited the proliferation of enzalutamide-resistant AR-positive LN95 and 22Rv1 cells, but not AR-negative PC3 and DU145 cells.

Methods:   This phase I/II study enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The primary objectives of phase I were to investigate the safety and tolerability of isatuximab (anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody)+cemiplimab (anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, Isa+Cemi) in patients with mCRPC (naïve to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy) or NSCLC (progressed on anti-PD-1/PD-L1-containing therapy). Phase II used Simon's two-stage design with response rate as the primary endpoint. An interim analysis was planned after the first 24 (mCRPC) and 20 (NSCLC) patients receiving Isa+Cemi were enrolled in phase II. Safety, immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity were assessed, including CD38, PD-L1, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and peripheral immune cell phenotyping.  Results:   Isa+Cemi demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no new safety signals. All patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent adverse event. Grade≥3 events occurred in 13 (54.2%) patients with mCRPC and 12 (60.0%) patients with NSCLC. Based on PCWG3 criteria, assessment of best overall response with Isa+Cemi in mCRPC revealed no complete responses (CRs), one (4.2%) unconfirmed partial response (PR), and five (20.8%) patients with stable disease (SD). Per RECIST V.1.1, patients with NSCLC receiving Isa+Cemi achieved no CR or PR, and 13 (65%) achieved SD. In post-therapy biopsies obtained from patients with mCRPC or NSCLC, Isa+Cemi treatment resulted in a reduction in median CD38+ tumor-infiltrating immune cells from 40% to 3%, with no consistent modulation of PD-L1 on tumor cells or T regulatory cells in the TME. The combination triggered a significant increase in peripheral activated and cytolytic T cells but, interestingly, decreased natural killer cells.  Conclusions:   The present study suggests that CD38 and PD-1 modulation by Isa+Cemi has a manageable safety profile, reduces CD38+ immune cells in the TME, and activates peripheral T cells; however, such CD38 inhibition was not associated with significant antitumor activity. A lack of efficacy was observed in these small cohorts of patients with mCRPC or NSCLC.

We assessed the management impact of 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET/CT in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) and report early biochemical response in patients who underwent radiation treatment. Methods: One hundred patients were enrolled into a prospective study, with a prior RP for prostate cancer, a PSA of 0.2-2.0 ng/mL, and no prior treatment. All patients underwent diagnostic CT and PSMA PET/CT, and management intent was completed at 3 time points (original, post-CT, and post-PSMA) and compared. Patients who underwent radiotherapy with 6-mo PSA response data are presented. Results: Ninety-eight patients are reported, with a median PSA of 0.32 ng/mL (95% CI, 0.28-0.36), pT3a/b disease in 71.4%, and an International Society of Urological Pathology grade group of at least 3 in 59.2%. PSMA PET/CT detected disease in 46.9% of patients, compared with 15.5% using diagnostic CT (PSMA PET, 29.2% local recurrence and 29.6% pelvic nodal disease). A major change in management intent was higher after PSMA than after CT (12.5% vs. 3.2%, P = 0.010), as was a moderate change in intent (31.3% vs. 13.7%, P = 0.001). The most common change was an increase in the recommendation for elective pelvic radiation (from 15.6% to 33.3%), nodal boost (from 0% to 22.9%), and use of concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) (from 22.9% to 41.7%) from original to post-PSMA intent because of detection of nodal disease. Eighty-six patients underwent 18F-DCFPyL-guided radiotherapy. Fifty-five of 86 patients either did not receive ADT or recovered after ADT, with an 18-mo PSA response from 0.32 to 0.02 ng/mL; 94.5% of patients had a PSA of no more than 0.20 ng/mL, and 74.5% had a PSA of no more than 0.03 ng/mL. Conclusion: 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT has a significant impact on management intent in patients being considered for salvage radiotherapy after RP with PSA recurrence.

Objective:   To understand the mechanisms by which subclones within early PCa develop into CRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   We isolated epithelial cells from fresh human PCa cases, including primary adenocarcinoma, locally recurrent CRPC, and metastatic CRPC, and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing to identify subpopulations destined to become either CRPC-adeno or small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SCNC).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We revealed dynamic transcriptional reprogramming that promotes disease progression among 23226 epithelial cells using single-cell RNA sequencing, and validated subset-specific progression using immunohistochemistry and large cohorts of publically available genomic data.  Results and limitations:   We identified a small fraction of highly plastic CRPC-like cells in hormone-naïve early PCa and demonstrated its correlation with biochemical recurrence and distant metastasis, independent of clinical characteristics. We show that progression toward castration resistance was initiated from subtype-specific lineage plasticity and clonal expansion of pre-existing neuroendocrine and CRPC-like cells in early PCa.  Conclusions:   CRPC-like cells are present early in the development of PCa and are not exclusively the result of acquired evolutionary selection during androgen deprivation therapy. The lethal CRPC and SCNC phenotypes should be targeted earlier in the disease course of patients with PCa.  Patient summary:   Here, we report the presence of pre-existing castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-like cells in primary prostate cancer, which represents a novel castration-resistant mechanism different from the adaptation mechanism after androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients whose tumors harbor increased pre-existing neuroendocrine and CRPC-like cells may become rapidly resistant to ADT and may require aggressive early intervention.""","""['Qing Cheng', 'William Butler', 'Yinglu Zhou', 'Hong Zhang', 'Lu Tang', 'Kathryn Perkinson', 'Xufeng Chen', 'Xiaoyin Sara Jiang', 'Shannon J McCall', 'Brant A Inman', 'Jiaoti Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Erratum to ""Pre-existing Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer-like Cells in Primary Prostate Cancer Promote Resistance to Hormonal Therapy"" Eur Urol 2022;81(5):446-55.', 'The Needle in the Haystack: The Presence of Castrate-resistant Prostate Cancer Cells in Hormone-naïve Prostate Cancer.', 'Re: Qing Cheng, William Butler, Yinglu Zhou, et al.

The AuCu NPs were formed by the cysteine-induced co-reduction reaction, which displayed bright PL with an emission peak at 560 nm. Meanwhile, the Cu(I) doping caused a maximum 25-fold enhancement of quantum yield (QY), compared with the native Au(I) complexes, i.e., from 0.85 to 21.5%. By integrating the AuCu NPs with p-phenylenediamine (PPD) oxidation reaction, an IFE-based sensor for sarcosine detection was constructed. In this method, sarcosine is oxidized under the catalysis of sarcosine oxidase (SOx) to yield H2O2. The latter further oxidizes PPD to form 2,5-diamino-N,N'-bis(p-aminophenyl)-l,4-benzoquinone di-imine (PPDox) in the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The UV-vis absorption spectrum of the PPDox can overlap well with the excitation and emission spectra of the AuCu NPs, resulting in the efficient quenching of the AuCu NPs via the IFE effect. Therefore, this IFE-based AuCu NPs/SOx/PPD/HRP sensing platform can be used for highly sensitive and specific sensing of sarcosine. The sensing platform showed two linear regions of the PL intensity of the AuCu NPs versus the concentration of sarcosine in the range of 0.5-5 μM and 5-100 μM with a detection limit (LOD) of 0.12 μM (S/N = 3). Furthermore, this IFE-based sensing platform could be developed into a paper-based biosensor for simple, instrument-free, and visual detection of sarcosine.""","""['Xiangfang Lin', 'Meng Tian', 'Chengcheng Cao', 'Tong Shu', 'Yongqiang Wen', 'Lei Su', 'Xueji Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['A Rapid Method for the Detection of Sarcosine Using SPIONs/Au/CS/SOX/NPs for Prostate Cancer Sensing.', 'Organic polymer dot-based fluorometric determination of the activity of horseradish peroxidase and of the concentrations of glucose and the insecticidal protein toxin Cry1Ab/Ac.', 'Highly branched gold-copper nanostructures for non-enzymatic specific detection of glucose and hydrogen peroxide.', 'Fluorescence sensing platform for sarcosine analysis based on nitrogen-doping copper nanosheets and gold nanoclusters.', 'Strongly phosphorescent and water-soluble gold(I)-silver(I)-cysteine nanoplatelets via versatile small biomolecule cysteine-assisted synthesis for intracellular hypochlorite detection.']"""

The time-course of in vitro drug release from NPs revealed a substantial drug retention profile compared to the unencapsulated drug. These NPs were selectively internalized into target PC cells overexpressing PSMA, and displayed a dose-dependent growth inhibition compared to cells devoid of the PSMA receptor.

For each suicide, sex, age, country of origin, body area affected by cancer, further pathological history, medications, previous suicide attempts and suicidal communications, as well as the place where the suicide occurred, were assessed. Furthermore, from a forensic point of view, we considered the chosen suicide method and any involved means. The majority of cases were male older adults affected by lung, colon and prostate cancer.

We investigated, using targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), a 59-year-old Caucasian man who developed synchronous breast and prostate cancers. This genetic investigation allowed to identify an intragenic germline heterozygous duplication in PALB2, implicating intronic repetitive sequences spanning exon 11.

RT-PCR using mRNA extracted from lymphocytes and followed by Sanger sequencing revealed a tandem duplication r.3114_3201dup; p.(Gly1068Glufs * 14).

We investigated the functions and regulatory mechanisms of CAPE in relation to MALT1 in prostate carcinoma cells. In p53- and androgen receptor (AR)-positive prostate carcinoma cells, CAPE downregulated AR and MALT1 expression but enhanced that of p53, thus decreasing androgen-induced activation of MALT1 and prostate-specific antigen expressions. p53 downregulated the expression of MALT in prostate carcinoma cells through the putative consensus and nonconsensus p53 response elements. CAPE downregulated MALT1 expression and thus inhibited NF-κB activity in p53- and AR-negative prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells, eventually reducing cell proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. CAPE induced the ERK/JNK/p38/AMPKα1/2 signaling pathways; however, pretreatment with the corresponding inhibitors of MAPK or AMPK1/2 did not inhibit the CAPE effect on MALT1 blocking in PC-3 cells.

Through immunohistochemistry on human tissue microarrays, we showed that NLGN1 is expressed by prostatic and pancreatic cancer tissues in discrete stages and tumor districts. Next, we performed in vitro and in vivo assays, demonstrating that NLGN1 promotes cancer cell invasion and migration along nerves. Because of the established role of the neurotrophic factor glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in tumor-nerve interactions, we assessed a potential NLGN1-GDNF cooperation. We found that blocking GDNF activity with a specific antibody completely inhibited NLGN1-induced in vitro cancer cell invasion of nerves. Finally, we demonstrated that, in the presence of NLGN1, GDNF markedly activates cofilin, a cytoskeletal regulatory protein, altering filopodia dynamics.

Since the precise role of LCN2 in prostate cancer (PCa) is poorly understood, we aimed to elucidate its functions in PCa in vitro. For this purpose, LCN2 was transiently suppressed or permanently depleted in human PC-3 cells using siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout. Effects of LCN2 suppression on expression of different tumorigenic markers were investigated by Western blot analysis and RT-qPCR. LCN2 knockout cells were analyzed for cellular changes and their ability to cope endoplasmic stress compared to parenteral PC-3 cells. Reduced LCN2 was accompanied by decreased expression of IL-1β and Cx43. In PC-3 cells, LCN2 deficiency leads to reduced proliferation, diminished expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lower adhesion, and disrupted F-actin distribution. In addition, IL-1β expression strongly correlated with LCN2 levels. LCN2 knockout cells showed enhanced and sustained activation of unfolded protein response proteins when treated with tunicamycin or cultured under glucose deprivation. Interestingly, an inverse correlation between phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α subunit (p-eIF2α) and LCN2 expression was observed suggesting that LCN2 triggers protein synthesis under stress conditions.

This individual patient data meta-analysis of relevant randomised trials aimed to quantify the benefit of these interventions in aggregate and in clinically relevant subgroups.  Methods:   For this meta-analysis, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries, the Web of Science, Scopus, and conference proceedings to identify trials with results published in English between Jan 1, 1962, and Dec 30, 2020. Multicentre randomised trials were eligible if they evaluated the use or prolongation of ADT (or both) in men with localised prostate cancer receiving definitive radiotherapy, reported or collected distant metastasis and survival data, and used ADT for a protocol-defined finite duration. The Meta-Analysis of Randomized trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium was accessed to obtain individual patient data from randomised trials. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained through stratified Cox models for ADT use (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus ADT), neoadjuvant ADT extension (ie, extension of total ADT duration in the neoadjuvant setting from 3-4 months to 6-9 months), and adjuvant ADT prolongation (ie, prolongation of total ADT duration in the adjuvant setting from 4-6 months to 18-36 months). Formal interaction tests between interventions and metastasis-free survival were done for prespecified subgroups defined by age, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, and radiotherapy dose. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021236855.  Findings:   Our search returned 12 eligible trials that provided individual patient data (10 853 patients) with a median follow-up of 11·4 years (IQR 9·0-15·0). The addition of ADT to radiotherapy significantly improved metastasis-free survival (HR 0·83 [95% CI 0·77-0·89], p<0·0001), as did adjuvant ADT prolongation (0·84 [0·78-0·91], p<0·0001), but neoadjuvant ADT extension did not (0·95 [0·83-1·09], p=0·50). Treatment effects were similar irrespective of radiotherapy dose, patient age, or NCCN risk group.  Interpretation:   Our findings provide the strongest level of evidence so far to the magnitude of the benefit of ADT treatment intensification with radiotherapy for men with localised prostate cancer. Adding ADT and prolonging the portion of ADT that follows radiotherapy is associated with improved metastasis-free survival in men, regardless of risk group, age, and radiotherapy dose delivered; however, the magnitude of the benefit could vary and shared decision making with patients is recommended.

We utilized dual ERG/SPINK1 immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm ERG rearrangements and characterize PTEN deletion, as well as high-resolution melting curve analysis and Sanger sequencing to determine SPOP mutation status.RESULTSBased on index focus alone, ERG, SPINK1, PTEN, and SPOP alterations were identified in 47.5%, 10.8%, 14.3%, and 5.1% of RP specimens, respectively. In 233 multifocal RPs with ERG/SPINK1 status in all foci, 139 (59.7%) had discordant molecular alterations between foci.

We present this phenomenon as a model for the intrafocal heterogeneity observed in previous studies and propose that future genomic studies screen for collision tumors to better characterize molecular heterogeneity.FUNDINGEarly Detection Research Network US National Cancer Institute (NCI) 5U01 CA111275-09, Center for Translational Pathology at Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, US NCI (WCM SPORE in Prostate Cancer, P50CA211024-01), R37CA215040, Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation, US MetLife Foundation Family Clinical Investigator Award, Norwegian Cancer Society (grant 208197), and South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority (grant 2019016 and 2020063).""","""['Jacqueline Fontugne', 'Peter Y Cai', 'Hussein Alnajar', 'Bhavneet Bhinder', 'Kyung Park', 'Huihui Ye', 'Shaham Beg', 'Verena Sailer', 'Javed Siddiqui', 'Mirjam Blattner-Johnson', 'Jaclyn A Croyle', 'Zohal Noorzad', 'Carla Calagua', 'Theresa Y MacDonald', 'Ulrika Axcrona', 'Mari Bogaard', 'Karol Axcrona', 'Douglas S Scherr', 'Martin G Sanda', 'Bjarne Johannessen', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Olivier Elemento', 'Rolf I Skotheim', 'Mark A Rubin', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Juan Miguel Mosquera']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JCI Insight""","""['Evidence for molecular differences in prostate cancer between African American and Caucasian men.', 'Clonal evaluation of early onset prostate cancer by expression profiling of ERG, SPINK1, ETV1, and ETV4 on whole-mount radical prostatectomy tissue.', 'Novel dual-color immunohistochemical methods for detecting ERG-PTEN and ERG-SPINK1 status in prostate carcinoma.', 'Molecular Underpinnings Governing Genetic Complexity of ETS-Fusion-Negative Prostate Cancer.', 'The emerging role of speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) in cancer development.', 'Characterization of Immune-Based Molecular Subtypes and Prognostic Model in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'In\u2009situ expression of ERG protein in the context of tumor heterogeneity identifies prostate cancer patients with inferior prognosis.']"""

The effect of testosterone on the tumor genome is not explored. We sought to explore the correlation between perioperative testosterone level and genomic risk score in a cohort of men who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   We included patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (2013-2018) and had adverse pathological features in their final surgical specimens (positive margin, and/or pT3a or higher). The outcome of interest was the genomic risk score: low (<0.45), intermediate (0.45-0.6) and high (>0.6). The associations between serum testosterone level and 188 gene expression-based signatures were examined. Secondary outcomes of interest included biochemical recurrence and receipt of secondary treatment.  Results:   The median genomic risk score was lower in the low testosterone group compared to the intermediate and normal testosterone groups (0.38 vs 0.52 vs 0.53, respectively; p=0.049). There was no difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival between the 3 testosterone groups (p=0.9). Patients with low testosterone levels had higher odds of receiving secondary treatment (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.14-4.50; p=0.02) than those with normal levels. A total of 43 (of 188) gene expression signatures were associated with testosterone level (p <0.05). In total, 33 signatures were positively associated with serum testosterone levels, including 12 signatures involved in DNA repair pathways.  Conclusions:   This is the first study to assess the correlation of preoperative testosterone level on the tumor transcriptome and showed no clinical correlation between pre-defined genomic risk score groups and testosterone groups. This study adds to the notion of the limited role of endogenous testosterone on the development of de novo high-risk localized prostate cancer.""","""['Mohammed Shahait', 'Joseph G Cheaib', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Yang Liu', 'Ibrahim Abu Ghaida', 'Ryan W Dobbs', 'Mohamed Alshalalfa', 'Priti Lal', 'Daniel J Lee', 'David I Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['A 17-Gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Adverse Pathology in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Pathological and 3 Tesla Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Correlation with Whole Mount Histopathology.', 'Validation of a genomic classifier that predicts metastasis following radical prostatectomy in an at risk patient population.', 'Prostate-specific antigen level, stage or Gleason score: which is best for predicting outcomes after radical prostatectomy, and does it vary by the outcome being measured?

However, the effects of APOBEC-induced protein changes have not been systematically assessed. Here, we describe the effects of APOBEC on the coding sequence in primary and metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC).  Methods:   We determined the enrichment of amino acid (AA) changes resulting from APOBEC mutagenesis in 323 primary BC tumors and 424 metastatic breast cancer (mBC) lesions via comparison with a simulated mutational genomic landscape not under selection pressure. We subsequently explored genes with recurrent APOBEC-associated AA changes and investigated the clonality of individual APOBEC-associated mutations. Using public sequencing data from an independent primary BC and mBC cohort, we further confirm our findings by reporting genes having these enriched AA changes in an APOBEC context.  Results:   Our analysis demonstrated that several APOBEC-derived AA changes are significantly enriched compared with a simulated AA change distribution drawn at random. Among the enriched AA changes, Glutamate(E)>Lysine(K) and Glutamate(E)>Glutamine(Q) were mostly found at hotspots in oncogenes, whereas termination codons (Glutamine[Q]>STOP[X] and Serine[S]>STOP[X]) occurred in tumor suppressor genes and, mostly, not at hotspot locations. These mutations are found in genes contributing to BC initiation, eg, introduction of termination codons in TP53, MAP3K1, and CDH1 (in lobular BC) and two oncogenic hotspots in PIK3CA (p.E542K and p.E545K). In endocrine-resistant BC, we observed APOBEC-induced termination codons at ER-modulating genes, KMT2C, ARID1A, NF1, and ZFHX3. Finally, in mBC, compared with single PIK3CA mutations, dual PIK3CA mutations occurred more frequently in an APOBEC context (Fisher's exact P < .001).  Conclusion:   Our results show that APOBEC mutagenesis recurrently targets various known drivers of BC initiation, progression, and endocrine resistance.""","""['Manouk K Bos', 'Marcel Smid', 'Stefan Sleijfer', 'John W M Martens']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['APOBEC Mutational Signatures in Hormone Receptor-Positive Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Negative Breast Cancers Are Associated With Poor Outcomes on CDK4/6 Inhibitors and Endocrine Therapy.', 'Targeted sequencing reveals the somatic mutation landscape in a Swedish breast cancer cohort.', 'Genomic Landscape and Endocrine-Resistant Subgroup in Estrogen Receptor-Positive, Progesterone Receptor-Negative, and HER2-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Human Papillomavirus Carcinogenesis Mediated by APOBEC Mutagenesis.', 'Sequencing Endocrine Therapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer: What Do We Do After Disease Progression on a CDK4/6 Inhibitor?', 'Involvement of APOBEC3A/B Deletion in Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV)-like Positive Human Breast Cancer.', 'Clinical Implications of APOBEC3-Mediated Mutagenesis in Breast Cancer.', 'Epigenetics and environment in breast cancer: New paradigms for anti-cancer therapies.', 'Bioinformatics Method Was Used to Analyze the Highly Expressed Gene FAM83A of Breast Cancer in Young Women.']"""

We performed a consecutive cohort study of patients treated with PPRT at our institution to characterize this complication including impact on patient-reported quality of life.  Materials and methods:   Patients with potential followup ≥4 years following PPRT were identified. Freedom from ≥grade 2 hematuria (FFG2H; macroscopic blood) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Predictors of ≥grade 2 hematuria (G2H) were assessed via log-rank tests and the Cox model. Urinary patient-reported quality of life by EPIC-26 (26-question Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) was compared for patients with/without hematuria using mixed-effects regression.  Results:   A total of 216 men received PPRT (median 68.4 Gy, IQR 68.0-68.4) from 2007 to 2016 at a median of 20 months (IQR 9-45) after prostatectomy. Median followup was 72 months (IQR 54-99). A total of 85 men developed hematuria, of whom 49 (58%) underwent cystoscopy, 13 (15%) required intervention and 26 (31%) experienced recurrent hematuria. Eight-year FFG2H was 55%. G2H was highest in men treated with anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy (HR 3.24, p <0.001), men with bladder V65 Gy ≥43% (HR 1.97, p=0.004) and men with medication allergies (HR 1.73, p=0.049).

However, we hypothesize that Cloquet's node is not part of lymphatic metastatic spread of prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Between September 2016 and June 2019, 105 consecutive patients with high-risk prostate cancer (cT3a or Grade Group 4/5, or prostate specific antigen >20 ng/ml) underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. First, Cloquet's node was identified, retrieved and submitted separately to pathology as right and left Cloquet's node. Next, a pelvic lymph node dissection was completed including the external iliac, obturator fossa and hypogastric nodal packets. Each lymph node was cut into 3 mm slices which were separately embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically.  Results:   The final analysis included 95 patients. In this high-risk population, the median number of nodes removed was 22 (IQR 18-29); 39/95 patients (41%) had lymph node metastasis. The median number of Cloquet's nodes removed was 2 (IQR 2-3). Cloquet's node was negative in all but 1 patient (1.1%), who had very high-risk features and high metastatic burden in the lymph nodes.

However, the interplay between radiotherapy dose and the required minimum duration of ADT is uncertain.  Objective:   To determine the specific ADT duration threshold that provides a distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) benefit in patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or EBRT with a brachytherapy boost (EBRT+BT).  Design, settings, and participants:   This was a cohort study of 3 cohorts assembled from a multicenter retrospective study (2000-2013); a post hoc analysis of the Randomized Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy 03/04 (RADAR; 2003-2007) randomized clinical trial (RCT); and a cross-trial comparison of the RADAR vs the Deprivación Androgénica y Radio Terapía (Androgen Deprivation and Radiation Therapy; DART) 01/05 RCT (2005-2010). In all, the study analyzed 1827 patients treated with EBRT and 1108 patients treated with EBRT+BT from the retrospective cohort; 181 treated with EBRT and 203 with EBRT+BT from RADAR; and 91 patients treated with EBRT from DART. The study was conducted from October 15, 2020, to July 1, 2021, and the data analyses, from January 5 to June 15, 2021.  Exposures:   High-dose EBRT or EBRT+BT for an ADT duration determined by patient-physician choice (retrospective) or by randomization (RCTs).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was DMFS; secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum thresholds (months).  Results:   This cohort study of 3 studies totaling 3410 men (mean age [SD], 68 [62-74] years; race and ethnicity not collected) with high-risk prostate cancer found a significant interaction between the treatment type (EBRT vs EBRT+BT) and ADT duration (binned to <6, 6 to <18, and ≥18 months). Natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum duration thresholds of 26.3 months (95% CI, 25.4-36.0 months) for EBRT and 12 months (95% CI, 4.9-36.0 months) for EBRT+BT for optimal effect on DMFS. In RADAR, the prolongation of ADT for patients receiving only EBRT was not associated with significant improvements in DMFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65-1.57); however, for patients receiving EBRT+BT, a longer duration was associated with improved DMFS (DMFS HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.87; P = .01). For patients receiving EBRT alone (DART), 28 months of ADT was associated with improved DMFS compared with 18 months (RADAR HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.80; P = .01).  Conclusions and relevance:   These cohort study findings suggest that the optimal minimum ADT duration for treatment with high-dose EBRT alone is more than 18 months; and for EBRT+BT, it is 18 months or possibly less.

This study aimed to compare the effects of these two distinct fractionations on patient-reported quality of life (PRQOL) and tolerability.  Methods:   In this prospective phase II study, patients with low- and intermediate-risk localized PC were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the SBRT (36.25 Gy/5 fractions/2 weeks) or CFRT (76 Gy/38 fractions/7.5 weeks) treatment groups. The primary endpoint of variation in PRQOL at 1 year was assessed by changes in the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire scores and analysed by z-tests and t-tests.  Results:   Sixty-four eligible Chinese men were treated (SBRT, n = 31; CFRT, n = 33) with a median follow-up of 2.3 years. At 1 year, 40.0%/46.9% of SBRT/CFRT patients had a >5-point decrease in bowel score (p = 0.08/0.28), respectively, and 53.3%/46.9% had a >2-point decrease in urinary score (p = 0.21/0.07). There were no significant differences in EPIC score changes between the arms at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, but SBRT was associated with significantly fewer grade ≥ 1 acute and 1-year late gastrointestinal toxicities (acute: 35% vs. 87%, p < 0.0001; 1-year late: 64% vs. 84%, p = 0.03), and grade ≥ 2 acute genitourinary toxicities (3% vs. 24%, p = 0.04) compared with CFRT.

The anticancer efficacy of the ethanolic extract from the pericarps of Garcinia mangostana was investigated in human prostate cancer cells (PC3), melanoma cells (B16F10), breast cancer cells (MCF7), and glioblastoma (U87) cell lines.  Methods:   3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure cell viability. Propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis on a flow cytometer were used to identify apoptosis. Action on cell migration was evaluated by scratch assay and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured. Moreover, we investigated the synergistic efficacy with several combinations of Garcinia mangostana extract (GME) with doxorubicin.  Results:   GME reduced cell viability in malignant cell dose time-dependently. GME-induced sub- G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells control representing apoptotic cell death is involved in GME toxicity. Furthermore, GME exhibited inhibitory effects on the migration ability of U87 cells, which was accompanied by inhibition in the activity and expression of MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2). Besides, GSH level and SOD activity were significantly reduced while there was an increase in ROS and MDA concentration following 24 hr of GME treatment. Moreover, a combination of GME (1.5-25 μg/mL) with Dox (6 μg/mL) displayed synergistic efficacy and cell growth inhibition.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, GME could cause cell death in PC3, MCF7, U87, and B16F10 cell lines, in which apoptosis plays an imperative role. Plant extract decreased the migration ability of the cells by inhibiting the activity and expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a long-studied yet vexing drug target that has recently re-emerged as a potential druggable driver of many solid tumor types including breast and prostate cancer, and several antagonists are currently in early phase clinical trials. Since GR is also ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, understanding antagonist/GR interactions in normal tissues and tumor is crucial to defining a therapeutic index. Herein, we demonstrate that the GR radioligand 18F-YJH08 can map drug/GR engagement in vivo. Profiling target engagement in vivo showed that the GR antagonists RU486 (mifepristone) and CORT125281 engaged GR in fewer normal tissues compared to ORIC-101 or the agonist dexamethasone. Furthermore, 18F-YJH08 detected GR in human prostate cancer tumor models and measured receptor binding by RU486. In summary, these data show for the first time that antagonist/GR interactions can be measured in vivo with 18F-YJH08, a finding with clinical relevance as GR antagonists and 11C-YJH08 are currently in clinical trials.""","""['Hyunjung Kim', 'Yangjie Huang', 'Ning Zhao', 'Yung-Hua Wang', 'Sasank Sakhamuri', 'Shalini Chopra', 'Nima Hooshdaran', 'Renuka Sriram', 'Rahul Aggarwal', 'Michael J Evans']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['A Novel Radioligand Reveals Tissue Specific Pharmacological Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor Expression with Positron Emission Tomography.', 'The Synthesis and Structural Requirements for Measuring Glucocorticoid Receptor Expression In Vivo with (±)-11C-YJH08 PET.', 'Allosteric effects of dexamethasone and RU486 on glucocorticoid receptor-DNA interactions.', 'The selective glucocorticoid receptor antagonist CORT125281 has tissue-specific activity.', 'New lead compounds in the search for pure antiglucocorticoids and the dissociation of antiglucocorticoid effects.', 'Nuclear Receptor Imaging In Vivo-Clinical and Research Advances.']"""

One salient modification is the loss of the ability of prostate epithelial cells to accumulate high concentrations of zinc; however, molecular alterations associated with loss of zinc accumulating capability in malignant prostate cells remain poorly understood. Herein, we assessed the stage-specific expression of zinc transporters (ZNTs) belonging to the ZNT (SLC30A) and Zrt- and Irt-like protein (ZIP) (SLC39A) solute-carrier family in the prostate tissues of different genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) of PCa (TMPRSS2-ERG.Ptenflox/flox , Hi-Myc+/- , and transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate), their age-matched wild-type controls, and 104 prostate core biopsies from human patients with different pathological lesions. Employing immunohistochemistry, differences in the levels of protein expression and spatial distribution of ZNT were evaluated as a function of the tumor stage. Results indicated that the expression of zinc importers (ZIP1, ZIP2, and ZIP3), which function to sequester zinc from circulation and prostatic fluid, was low to negligible in the membranes of the malignant prostate cells in both GEMM and human prostate tissues. Regarding zinc exporters (ZNT1, ZNT2, ZNT9, and ZNT10) that export excess zinc into the extracellular spaces or intracellular organelles, their expression was low in normal prostate glands of mice and humans; however, it was significantly upregulated in prostate adenocarcinoma lesions in GEMM and PCa patients. Together, our findings provide new insights into altered expression of ZNTs during the progression of PCa and indicate that changes in zinc homeostasis could possibly be an early-initiation event during prostate tumorigenesis and a likely prevention/intervention target.""","""['Ram R Prasad', 'Komal Raina', 'Neha Mishra', 'Munendra S Tomar', 'Robin Kumar', 'Amy E Palmer', 'Paul Maroni', 'Rajesh Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Carcinog""","""['hZip2 and hZip3 zinc transporters are down regulated in human prostate adenocarcinomatous glands.', 'Characterization of stage-specific tumor progression in TMPRSS2-ERG (fusion)-driven and non-fusion-driven prostate cancer in GEM models.', 'Increased expression of zinc transporter ZIP4, ZIP11, ZnT1, and ZnT6 predicts poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.', 'Zinc fluxes and zinc transporter genes in chronic diseases.', 'Understanding the Contribution of Zinc Transporters in the Function of the Early Secretory Pathway.']"""

It is most commonly seen in mixed tumors together with conventional acinar adenocarcinoma (AA). The genetic profile of DA and its clonal origin is not fully characterized.  Objective:   To investigate whether DA represents a distinct genetic subtype and to investigate the somatic relationship between the ductal and acinar components of mixed cancers.  Design, setting, and participants:   In 17 radical prostatectomy specimens ductal and acinar tumor components from the same tumor foci were dissected. DNA was extracted and genomic sequencing performed. After exclusion of two cases with low cell yield, 15 paired samples remained for analysis.  Results:   In 12 of 15 cases a common somatic denominator was identified, while three cases had clonally separate components. In DA, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions were detected in 47% (7/15), clonal FOXA1 alterations in 33% (5/15) and SPOP alterations in 27% (4/15) of cases. In one case KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified. Genome doubling events, resulting in an increased ploidy, were identified in the DA in 53% (8/15) of cases, but not seen in any AA. PTEN and CTNNB1 alterations were enriched in DA (6/15) but not seen in any AA. No cancers showed microsatellite instability or high tumor mutation burden.

Methods:   Based on the AdC6 vector, the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter was used to drive the expression of E1A, the adenovirus replication-related gene, and the recombinant oncolytic virus AdC6-htertΔE1A-ΔE3 was thus obtained. The oncolytic virus AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) expressing granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF/CSF 2) and replication-deficient adenovirus AdC6-ΔE1-ΔE3 were constructed by homologous recombination, respectively. The recombinant adenovirus was packaged in HEK293 cells, purified and then identified with restriction enzyme digestion. Different types of tumor cells, including RD, SW-620, HeLa, Huh7, RM-1 and MC-38 were infected with the three adenoviruses. Twenty-four hours after infection, Western blot was used to determine the expression of CSF 2 24 hours after infection. CCK8 assay was used to determine the survival rate of tumor cells 72 hours after infection. HeLa cells were infected with the three adenoviruses, and the expression levels of apoptosis signaling pathway proteins were examined with Western blot at 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h. C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously injected with cell suspension containing 1×10 6 MC38 murine colon cancer cells and RM-1 murine prostate cancer cells to construct two tumor-bearing mice models. The tumor-bearing mice were divided into 4 groups, receiving intratumoral injection of 50 μL of PBS, AdC6-ΔE1-ΔE3 (1×10 8 PFU), AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (1×10 8PFU), and AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) (1×10 8 PFU), respectively. When the tumor size of PBS group reached 2 500 mm 3, all the mice were sacrificed and the tumor tissue was collected for TUNEL staining. Then, apoptosis-positive cells were observed and counted under a microscope.  Results:   Restriction digestion revealed that the oncolytic viruses AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3, AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) and AdC6-ΔE1-ΔE3 were successfully constructed. Western blot confirmed that AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) could infect different tumor cells and stably express CSF 2, the exogenous gene. CCK8 results showed that AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 and AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) had obvious killing effects on RD, SW-620, HeLa, Huh7, RM-1and MC-38. Compared with the replication-deficient adenovirus AdC6-ΔE1-ΔE3, AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 and AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) at a multiplicity of infection of 100 MOI had extremely obvious killing effects on tumor cells ( P<0.05). Western blot showed that AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 and AdC6-htertE1A-ΔE3 (CSF 2) induced tumor cell apoptosis by activating the P53-dependent pathway. Injection of oncolytic virus in tumor-bearing mouse models of prostate cancer and colorectal cancer could significantly inhibit the tumor growth and even clear the tumor.

Methods:   We created a database of all US counties by linking prostate cancer clinical trial data with county-level socioeconomic, demographic, and health-care facility data derived from several external data sources. Using this data linkage, we examined 2 potential access barriers. We investigated the relationship between the proportion of African Americans and access to cancer facilities, adjusting for county population size and other characteristics. Additionally, among counties with cancer facilities, we investigated the relationship between the proportion of African Americans and number of available prostate cancer trials per capita per year. We addressed these questions using logistic and negative binomial regression, respectively.  Results:   Between 2008 and 2015, 613 prostate cancer trial sites were found among 3145 US counties. Counties with a higher proportion of African Americans were less likely to have cancer facilities (adjusted odds ratio = 0.85, 95% confidence interval = 0.78 to 0.92).

These mutations confer ligand promiscuity, but the affinity for many steroid hormone pathway intermediates is unknown. In this study, we investigated the stimulation of clinically relevant AR-LBD mutants by endogenous and exogenous steroid hormones present in CRPC patients to unravel their potential contribution to AR pathway reactivation.  Methods:   A meta-analysis of studies reporting untargeted analysis of AR mutants was performed to identify clinically relevant AR-LBD mutations. Using luciferase reporter and quantitative fluorescent microscopy, these AR mutants were screened for sensitivity for various endogenous steroids and synthetic glucocorticoids used in the treatment of CRPC.  Results:   The meta-analysis revealed that ARL702H (3.4%), ARH875Y (4.9%), and ART878A (4.4%) were the most prevalent AR-LBD mutations across 1614 CRPC patients from 21 unique studies. Testosterone (EC50: 0.22 nmol/L) and 11-ketotestosterone (11KT, EC50: 0.74 nmol/L) displayed subnanomolar affinity for ARWT. The p.H875Y mutation selectively increased sensitivity of the AR for 11KT (EC50: 0.15 nmol/L, p < 0.05 vs ARWT), whereas p.L702H decreased sensitivity for 11KT by almost 50-fold.

We examined this relationship using laboratory, administrative and survey data.  Design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Setting:   All care settings within Calgary, Alberta, Canada and surrounding rural communities.  Participants:   Patients tested for serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D from 2009 to 2013 without a past cancer diagnosis but with an ECG and body mass index ±3 months from testing were included. Age, sex, mean hours of daylight during month of testing were linked to census dissemination area-level indicators of socioeconomic status measured in 2011.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Hospital discharge diagnoses for any cancer, major cancer (colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, skin) and other cancers >3 months from testing from 2009 to 2016. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine associations with incident cancer after adjusting for potential confounders. Interactions were tested using multiplicative terms.  Results:   Among 72 171 patients, there were 3439 cancer diagnoses over a median of 5.9 years. After adjustment, increasing quartile of serum 25-OH vitamin D was significantly associated with an increased risk of any cancer and major cancer, however this was completely driven by an increased risk of skin cancer (Q4 vs Q1: HR=2.56, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.86, p for linear trend <0.01). This association was strengthened among individuals residing in communities with higher proportions of non-citizens, recent immigrants, visible (non-white) minorities and those not speaking an official Canadian language (English or French) at home.  Conclusions:   Higher vitamin D status was associated with a greater risk of skin cancer in a large community population under investigation for cardiovascular disease.

Inter- and intratumor heterogeneity in signaling within various tumor compartments and its impact on therapy are not well characterized due to the limited sensitivity of single-cell proteomic approaches. To overcome this barrier, we applied single-cell mass cytometry with a customized 26-antibody panel to PTEN-deleted orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft models to measure the evolution of kinase activities in different tumor compartments during metastasis or drug treatment. Compared with primary tumors and circulating tumor cells (CTC), bone metastases, but not lung and liver metastases, exhibited elevated PI3K/mTOR signaling and overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) including c-MET protein. Suppression of c-MET impaired tumor growth in the bone. Intratumoral heterogeneity within tumor compartments also arose from highly proliferative EpCAM-high epithelial cells with increased PI3K and mTOR kinase activities coexisting with poorly proliferating EpCAM-low mesenchymal populations with reduced kinase activities; these findings were recapitulated in epithelial and mesenchymal CTC populations in patients with metastatic prostate and breast cancer. Increased kinase activity in EpCAM-high cells rendered them more sensitive to PI3K/mTOR inhibition, and drug-resistant EpCAM-low populations with reduced kinase activity emerged over time. Taken together, single-cell proteomics indicate that microenvironment- and cell state-dependent activation of kinase networks create heterogeneity and differential drug sensitivity among and within tumor populations across different sites, defining a new paradigm of drug responses to kinase inhibitors.  Significance:   Single-cell mass cytometry analyses provide insights into the differences in kinase activities across tumor compartments and cell states, which contribute to heterogeneous responses to targeted therapies.""","""['Nezihi Murat Karabacak#', 'Yu Zheng#', 'Taronish D Dubash', 'Risa Burr', 'Douglas S Micalizzi', 'Ben S Wittner', 'Maoxuan Lin', 'Devon F Wiley', 'Valentine Comaills', 'Erin Emmons', 'Kira L Niederhoffer', 'Uyen Ho', 'Jacob Ukleja', 'Dante Che', 'Hannah Stowe', 'Linda T Nieman', 'Wilhelm Haas', 'Shannon L Stott', 'Michael S Lawrence', 'David T Ting', 'David T Miyamoto', 'Daniel A Haber', 'Mehmet Toner', 'Shyamala Maheswaran']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is associated with prostate cancer metastasis and chemo/radioresistance via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'High Sensitivity of Circulating Tumor Cells Derived from a Colorectal Cancer Patient for Dual Inhibition with AKT and mTOR Inhibitors.', 'Deglycosylated EpCAM regulates proliferation by enhancing autophagy of breast cancer cells via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Usefulness of on-site cytology of liver tumor biopsy in specimen sampling for cancer genomic profiling test.']"""

The purpose of this study was to analyze how the Opioid Safety Initiative (OSI) implemented at the Veterans Health Administration affected opioid prescribing patterns and opioid-related toxicity.  Methods:   We performed an interrupted time series analysis of 42 064 opioid-naïve patients treated at the Veterans Health Administration for prostate, lung, breast, and colorectal cancer from 2011 to 2016. Segmented regression was used to evaluate the impact of the OSI on the incidence of any new opioid prescriptions, high-risk prescriptions, persistent use, and pain-related emergency department (ED) visits. We compared the cumulative incidence of adverse opioid events including an opioid-related admission or diagnosis of misuse before and after the OSI. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   The incidence of new opioid prescriptions was 26.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 25.0% to 28.4%) in 2011 and increased to 50.6% (95% CI = 48.3% to 53.0%) by 2013 before OSI implementation (monthly rate of change: +3.3%, 95% CI = 1.3% to 4.2%, P < .001). After the OSI, there was a decrease in the monthly rate of change for new prescriptions (-3.4%, 95% CI = -3.9 to -2.9%, P < .001). The implementation of the OSI was associated with a decrease in the monthly rate of change of concomitant benzodiazepines and opioid prescriptions (-2.5%, 95% CI = -3.2% to -1.8%, P < .001), no statistically significant change in high-dose opioids (-1.2%, 95% CI = -3.2% to 0.9%, P = .26), a decrease in persistent opioid use (-5.7%, 95% CI = -6.8% to -4.7%, P < .001), and an increase in pain-related ED visits (+3.0%, 95% CI = 1.0% to 5.0%, P = .003). The OSI was associated with a decreased incidence of opioid-related admissions (3-year cumulative incidence: 0.9% [95% CI = 0.7% to 1.0%] vs 0.5% [95% CI = 0.4% to 0.6%], P < .001) and no statistically significant change in the incidence of opioid misuse (3-year cumulative incidence: 1.2% [95% CI = 1.0% to 1.3%] vs 1.2% [95% CI = 1.1% to 1.4%], P = .77).  Conclusions:   The OSI was associated with a relative decline in the rate of new, persistent, and certain high-risk opioid prescribing as well as a slight increase in the rate of pain-related ED visits.

We tested the hypothesis that patients taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) have a reduced risk of late hematuria. We additionally tested genetically-defined hypertension.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer patients undergoing potentially-curative radiotherapy were enrolled onto two multi-center observational studies, URWCI (N = 256) and REQUITE (N = 1,437). Patients were assessed pre-radiotherapy and followed prospectively for development of toxicity for up to four years. The cumulative probability of hematuria was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariable grouped relative risk models assessed the effect of ACEi on time to hematuria adjusting for clinical factors and stratified by enrollment site. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for blood pressure was tested for association with hematuria in REQUITE and our Radiogenomics Consortium GWAS.  Results:   Patients taking ACEi during radiotherapy had a reduced risk of hematuria (HR 0.51, 95%CI 0.28 to 0.94, p = 0.030) after adjusting for prior transurethral prostate and/or bladder resection, heart disease, pelvic node radiotherapy, and bladder volume receiving 70 Gy, which are associated with hematuria. A blood pressure PRS was associated with hypertension (odds ratio per standard deviation 1.38, 95%CI 1.31 to 1.46, n = 5,288, p < 0.001) but not hematuria (HR per standard deviation 0.96, 95%CI 0.87 to 1.06, n = 5,126, p = 0.41).

The underlying concept of our project was the improvement of the lipophilic ligand efficiency of previously synthesized potent σ1 ligands. The key steps of the synthesis comprise the conjugate addition of phenylboronic acid at dihydropyridin-4(1H)-ones 7, homologation of the ketones 8 and introduction of diverse amino moieties and piperidine N-substituents. 1-Methylpiperidines showed particular high σ1 receptor affinity and selectivity over the σ2 subtype, whilst piperidines with a proton, a tosyl moiety or an ethyl moiety exhibited considerably lower σ1 affinity. Molecular dynamics simulations with per-residue binding free energy deconvolution demonstrated that different interactions of the basic piperidine-N-atom and its substituents (or the cyclohexane ring) with the lipophilic binding pocket consisting of Leu105, Thr181, Leu182, Ala185, Leu186, Thr202 and Tyr206 are responsible for the different σ1 receptor affinities. Recorded logD7.4 and calculated clogP values of 4a and 18a indicate low lipophilicity and thus high lipophilic ligand efficiency.

Results: BRCA1 PVs were associated with risks of male breast (RR = 4.30; 95% CI, 1.09 to 16.96), pancreatic (RR = 2.36; 95% CI, 1.51 to 3.68), and stomach (RR = 2.17; 95% CI, 1.25 to 3.77) cancers. Associations with colorectal and gallbladder cancers were also suggested. BRCA2 PVs were associated with risks of male breast (RR = 44.0; 95% CI, 21.3 to 90.9), stomach (RR = 3.69; 95% CI, 2.40 to 5.67), pancreatic (RR = 3.34; 95% CI, 2.21 to 5.06), and prostate (RR = 2.22; 95% CI, 1.63 to 3.03) cancers. The stomach cancer RR was higher for females than males (6.89 v 2.76; P = .04). The absolute risks to age 80 years ranged from 0.4% for male breast cancer to approximately 2.5% for pancreatic cancer for BRCA1 carriers and from approximately 2.5% for pancreatic cancer to 27% for prostate cancer for BRCA2 carriers.  Conclusion:   In addition to female breast and ovarian cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2 PVs are associated with increased risks of male breast, pancreatic, stomach, and prostate (only BRCA2 PVs) cancers, but not with the risks of other previously suggested cancers.

In order to more effectively conquer bone metastases and alleviate SREs, herein, we constructed biomineralized metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles carrying protein toxins with both bone-seeking and CD44-receptor-targeting abilities. More importantly, through combination with Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-κ B Ligand (RANKL) antibody, in vivo results demonstrated that these two protein agents not only enhanced the detraction effects of protein toxin agents as ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP) on bone metastatic tumor cells but also exhibited synergistic intervention of the crosstalk between bone cells and tumor cells and reduced SREs such as bone loss. Collectively, we expect that this strategy can provide an effective and safe option in regulating bone-tumor microenvironments to overcome bone metastasis and SREs.""","""['Yimin Niu', 'Hongbin Yang', 'Zhenyan Yu', 'Cuicui Gao', 'Shuaishuai Ji', 'Jie Yan', 'Lei Han', 'Qiang Huo', 'Ming Xu', 'Yang Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""['Roles of the RANKL-RANK Axis in Immunity-Implications for Pathogenesis and Treatment of Bone Metastasis.', 'Heterogeneity of tumor cells in the bone microenvironment: Mechanisms and therapeutic targets for bone metastasis of prostate or breast cancer.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.', 'DU145 human prostate cancer cells express functional receptor activator of NFkappaB: new insights in the prostate cancer bone metastasis process.', 'RANKL inhibition combined with tamoxifen treatment increases anti-tumor efficacy and prevents tumor-induced bone destruction in an estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer bone metastasis model.', 'Potential biomarkers for the early detection of bone metastases.', 'The RANK/RANKL/OPG system and tumor bone metastasis: Potential mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.', 'Osteoporosis in Patients With Respiratory Diseases.']"""

PSA tests are used to classify participants into a low (<1.5 ng/mL), intermediate (1.5-2.99 ng/mL) or high (≥3 ng/mL) risk group. In cases of confirmed PSA values ≥3 ng/mL participants are recommended a prostate biopsy with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Half of the participants (N = 23 341) were offered PSA screening immediately at age 45; the other half (N = 23 301) were offered digital rectal examination (DRE) with delayed PSA screening at age 50. Of 23 301 participants who accepted baseline PSA testing in the immediate screening arm, 89.2% fell into the low, 9.3% into intermediate, and 1.5% (N = 344) into the high risk group. Repeat PSA measurement confirmed high-risk status for 186 men (0.8%), of whom 120 (64.5%) underwent a biopsy. A total of 48 PCas was detected (overall prevalence 0.2%), of which 15 had International Society of Uropathology (ISUP) grade 1, 29 had ISUP 2 and only 4 had ISUP ≥3 cancers. In the delayed screening arm, 23 194 participants were enrolled and 6537 underwent a DRE with 57 suspicious findings, two of which showed PCa (both ISUP 1; detection rate 0.03%).

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 378 patients who underwent RARP with LND at our hospital between October 2010 and June 2019. The BCR-free survival rate was determined using Kaplan-Meier analysis, and Cox regression analysis was used to investigate BCR prognostic factors. The total score calculated from the D'Amico risk classification and the percentage of positive biopsy cores were used for analysis. Patients were classified into 3 BCR risk groups (low risk: 0-3 points, intermediate risk: 4-5 points, and high risk: 6-8 points).  Results:   Limited LND was performed in 161 patients (42.6%), extended LND in 217 patients (57.4%), and BCR was confirmed in 66 patients (17.5%) after RARP. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed no significant difference in the association between the extent of LND and BCR. The Kaplan-Meier curve for BCR generated using our risk classification for patients with PCa without LNI showed no significant association between the extent of LND and BCR in the low-risk group (p = 0.790). A significantly improved BCR-free survival was observed in the extended LND group among patients with PCa at intermediate risk or higher (p < 0.05).

Objective:   To compare the clinical consequences of incident severe CKD and the first diagnosis with a malignant tumor, focusing on the 10 leading causes of cancer in men and women residing in Canada.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study enrolled individuals aged 19 years and older with severe CKD or certain types of cancer between 2004 and 2015 in Alberta, Canada. Data were analyzed in November 2021.  Exposures:   Individuals were categorized as having severe CKD (based on estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or nephrotic albuminuria without dialysis or kidney transplantation) or nonmetastatic or metastatic cancer (defined by a diagnosis of lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, bladder, thyroid, kidney or renal pelvis, uterus, pancreas, or oral cancer).  Main outcomes and measures:   All-cause mortality, number of hospitalizations, total number of hospital days, and placement into long-term care were calculated after diagnosis.  Results:   Of 200 494 individuals in the cohort (104 559 women [52.2%]; median [IQR] age, 66.8 [55.9-77.7] years), 51 159 (25.5%) had incident severe CKD, 115 504 (57.6%) had nonmetastatic cancer, and 33 831 (16.9%) had metastatic cancer. Kaplan-Meier 1-year survival was 83.3% (95% CI, 83.0%-83.6%) for patients with CKD, 91.2% (95% CI, 91.0%-91.4%) for patients with nonmetastatic cancer, and 52.8% (95% CI, 52.2%-53.3%) for patients with metastatic cancer. Kaplan-Meier 5-year survival was 54.6% (95% CI, 54.2%-55.1%) for patients with CKD, 76.6% (95% CI, 76.3%-76.8%) for patients with nonmetastatic cancer, and 33.9% (95% CI, 33.3%-34.4%) for patients with metastatic cancer. Compared with nonmetastatic cancer, the age-, sex-, and comorbidity-adjusted relative rate of death was similar for CKD (adjusted relative rate, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.97-1.03; P = .92) during the first year of follow-up and was higher for CKD at years 1 to 5 (adjusted relative rate 1.23; 95% CI, 1.19-1.26). During the first year of follow-up, for patients with CKD, adjusted rates of placement in long-term care (adjusted relative rate, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82-0.94) and hospitalization (adjusted relative rate, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.64-0.66) were lower than rates for patients with nonmetastatic cancer; however, those rates were higher for the CKD group than for the nonmetastatic cancer group during years 1 to 5 (long-term care placement, adjusted relative rate, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.29-1.43; hospitalization, adjusted relative rate, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.52-1.58). As expected, adjusted rates of long-term care placement and hospitalization were higher for patients with metastatic cancer than for the other 2 groups.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, mortality, hospitalization, and likelihood of placement into long-term care were similar for CKD and nonmetastatic cancer.

Purpose To develop multiparametric MRI criteria to define DAC and to assess their diagnostic performance in differentiating DAC from prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma (PAC). Materials and Methods Men with histologically proven DAC who had multiparametric MRI before radical prostatectomy were retrospectively identified from January 2011 through November 2018. MRI features were predefined using a subset of nine DACs and then compared for men with peripheral-zone DACs 1 cm or greater in size and men with matched biopsy-confirmed International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 4-5 PAC, by four independent radiologists blinded to the pathologic diagnosis. Diagnostic performance was determined by consensus read. Patient and tumor characteristics were compared by using the Fisher test, t-tests, and Mann-Whitney U test. Agreement (Cohen κ) and sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results There were 59 men with DAC (median age, 63 years [interquartile range, 56, 67 years]) and 59 men with PAC (median age, 64 years [interquartile range, 59, 69 years]). Predefined MRI features, including intermediate T2 signal, well-defined margin, lobulation, and hypointense rim, were detected in a higher proportion of DACs than PACs (76% [45 of 59] vs 5% [three of 59]; P < .001). On consensus reading, the presence of three or more features demonstrated 76% sensitivity, 94% specificity, 94% positive predictive value [PPV], and 80% negative predictive value [NPV] for all DACs and 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, 81% PPV, and 100% NPV for pure DACs. The DACs and PACs showed no difference in contrast enhancement (100% vs 100%; P >.99, median T2 signal intensity (254 vs 230; P = .99), or apparent diffusion coefficient (median, 677 10-6 mm2/sec vs 685 10-6 mm2/sec; P = .73). Conclusion The presence of intermediate T2 signal, well-defined margin, lobulation, and/or hypointense rim, together with restricted diffusion and contrast enhancement at multiparametric MRI of the prostate, suggests prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma rather than prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.""","""['Weranja K B Ranasinghe', 'Patricia Troncoso', 'Devaki Shilpa Surasi', 'Juan José Ibarra Rovira', 'Priya Bhosale', 'Janio Szklaruk', 'Andrea Kokorovic', 'Xuemei Wang', 'Mohamed Elsheshtawi', 'Miao Zhang', 'Ana Aparicio', 'Brian F Chapin', 'Tharakeswara K Bathala']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Diagnostic Accuracy and Observer Agreement of the MRI Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting Assessment Score.', 'Diagnostic Performance of 68Ga Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET/MRI Compared with Multiparametric MRI for Detecting Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'The predictive value of endorectal 3 Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for extraprostatic extension in patients with low, intermediate and high risk prostate cancer.', 'Optimizing the diagnosis and management of ductal prostate cancer.', 'Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate: A systematic review and meta-analysis of incidence, presentation, prognosis, and management.', 'Nomogram Models for Distinguishing Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate From Prostatic Acinar Adenocarcinoma Based on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.']"""

Purpose To assess the disease detection rate of PSMA-based PET/CT with fluorine 18-DCFPyL as a radiotracer and the PET-directed management change in men with suspected limited recurrent prostate cancer. Materials and Methods This prospective multicenter registry (Ontario PSMA-PET Registry for Recurrent Prostate Cancer, or PREP) enrolled men with BCF after primary therapy (radical prostatectomy plus or minus salvage radiation therapy or primary radiation therapy) and zero to four disease sites at conventional imaging (CT and bone scintigraphy). The positivity rate of PSMA PET according to serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level; frequency of local-egional, oligometastatic, and extensive metastatic recurrence; and rate of change in management after PET findings were recorded. The nonparametric Mood median test was used to assess the association between serum PSA level and change in management. Results A total of 1289 men (median age, 71 years [interquartile range, 65-75 years]) were evaluated. PSMA PET helped detect disease in 841 of 1289 men (65%) and in 615 of 999 men (62%) with negative conventional imaging. The recurrence detection rates according to serum PSA level at enrollment were 38% (160 of 424 men), 63% (107 of 171 men), and 83% (573 of 692 men) for PSA under 0.5 ng/mL, 0.5-1.0 ng/mL, and above 1.0 ng/mL, respectively. At PSMA PET, 399 of 1289 men (31%) had local-regional recurrence, 314 (24%) had oligometastatic disease, and 128 (10%) had extensive metastases. Following PET examination, a change in planned management was recorded in 748 of 1289 men (58%), and in 371 of 1250 men (30%), there was a change in management intent, more commonly from palliative to potentially curative intent (255 of 1289 men [20%]). Conclusion Prostate-specific membrane antigen PET helped detect additional sites of disease compared with conventional imaging in approximately 60% of men with biochemical failure and suspected low-volume metastatic disease, resulting in frequent change in management, including a change from palliative to curative or radical intent therapy in 20% of men.

Many questions remain as to the origin, development, and function of TAMs within the prostate TME. Evaluation of TAMs in prostate cancer (PCa) patients identified the immunosuppressive TAM marker CD163 in adjacent normal epithelium as an independent predictor of metastases or PCa death. Flow cytometry analyses identified prostate TAMs as frequently expressing both proinflammatory M1 (CCR7+) and immunosuppressive M2 (CD163+) markers. In vitro, we demonstrate PCa cells similarly subvert human M1 macrophages toward a mixed M1/M2 macrophage phenotype favoring tumor growth. Further the cytokine milieu-induced transition between immunosuppressive M2 to proinflammatory M1 (M2→M1) macrophages is abrogated by the presence of PCa cells. RNA sequencing suggests alterations in chemokine expression in prostate TAMs due to the presence of PCa cells. Together, our results suggest that prostate TAMs originate from inflammatory infiltrating macrophages, which are then reprogrammed mainly by PCa cells, but also the cytokine milieu.

Novel biomarkers for detection and prognosis are needed to improve the survival of distant and advanced stage prostate cancer patients. The tumor microenvironment is an important driving factor for tumor biological functions. To investigate RNA prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer in the tumor microenvironment, we obtained relevant data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We used the bioinformatics tools Estimation of Stromal and Immune cells in Malignant Tumor tissues using Expression data (ESTIMATE) algorithm and weighted coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to construct tumor microenvironment stromal-immune score-based competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. Then, the Cox regression model was performed to screen RNAs associated with prostate cancer survival. The differentially expressed gene profile in tumor stroma was significantly enriched in microenvironment functions, like immune response, cancer-related pathways, and cell adhesion-related pathways. Based on these differentially expressed genes, we constructed three ceRNA networks with 152 RNAs associated with the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment. Cox regression analysis screened 31 RNAs as the potential prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer. The most interesting 8 prognostic biomarkers for prostate cancer included lncRNA LINC01082, miRNA hsa-miR-133a-3p, and genes TTLL12, PTGDS, GAS6, CYP27A1, PKP3, and ZG16B. In this systematic study for ceRNA networks in the tumor environment, we screened out potential biomarkers to predict prognosis for prostate cancer.

Using an orthotopic tumor model and an ex-vivo model of bone marrow derived M2-like macrophages, we sought to determine if ω-3 FAs inhibit angiogenesis and activate T-cells, and if these effects are dependent on GPR120.  Methods:   Gausia luciferase labeled MycCaP prostate cancer cells (MycCaP-Gluc) were injected into the anterior prostate lobe of FVB mice. After established tumors were confirmed by blood luminescence, mice were fed an ω-3 or ω-6 diet. Five weeks after tumor injection, tumor weight, immune cell infiltration and markers of angiogenesis were determined. An ex-vivo co-culture model of bone marrow derived M2-like macrophages from wild-type or GPR120 knockout mice with MycCap prostate cancer cells was used to determine if docosahexanoic acid (DHA, ω-3 FA) inhibition of angiogenesis and T-cell activation is dependent on macrophage GPR120.  Results:   Feeding an ω-3 diet significantly reduced orthotopic MycCaP-Gluc tumor growth relative to an ω-6 diet. Tumors from the ω-3 group had decreased M2-like macrophage infiltration and decreased expression of angiogenesis factors. DHA significantly inhibited M2 macrophage-induced endothelial tube formation and reversed M2 macrophage-induced T-cell suppression, and these DHA effects were mediated, in part, by M2 macrophage GPR120.  Conclusion:   Omega-3 FAs delayed orthotopic tumor growth, inhibited M2-like macrophage tumor infiltration, and inhibited M2-like macrophage-induced angiogenesis and T-cell suppression. Given the central role of M2-like macrophages in prostate cancer progression, GPR120-dependent ω-3 FA inhibition of M2-like macrophages may play an important role in prostate cancer therapeutics.""","""['Pei Liang', 'Susanne M Henning', 'Tristan Grogan', 'David Elashoff', 'Huihui Ye', 'Pinchas Cohen', 'William J Aronson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Role of Host GPR120 in Mediating Dietary Omega-3 Fatty Acid Inhibition of Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of dietary omega-3 fatty acids on castrate-resistant prostate cancer and tumor-associated macrophages.', 'GPR120 is an omega-3 fatty acid receptor mediating potent anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing effects.', 'Functions of omega-3 fatty acids and FFA4 (GPR120) in macrophages.', 'Omega 3 fatty acids and GPR120.', 'A necroptosis gene signature predicts prostate cancer recurrence, and is linked to somatic mutation, therapeutic landscape, and immune infiltration.', 'Signaling pathways in cancer metabolism: mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'A healthy diet, a healthy prostate?

We aimed to evaluate the association between metabolic syndrome and its pharmacologic treatment with time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   We identified 409 men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer receiving first line ADT from 1996 to 2014 at our institution. Information concerning metabolic syndrome, statin use, aspirin use, and metformin use at initiation of ADT was collected from medical records. Time to CRPC was defined as the duration between initiating ADT and diagnosis of CRPC based on the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 definition. Flexible parametric survival models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR, and 95% confidence intervals, CI) of the association between metabolic conditions and time from ADT initiation to CRPC.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 59 months, 87% (N = 356) men progressed to CRPC. Median time to CRPC was 19 months. Fifty-six percent of men met the definition of metabolic syndrome. Controlling for demographic and prostate cancer-specific variables, metabolic syndrome was associated with shorter time to CRPC (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09-1.81). Importantly, in men with metabolic syndrome, statin use was associated with a slower progression to CRPC (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.49-0.98).

Therefore, inhibition of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 (17βHSD3), which catalyzes the carbonyl reduction of androstenedione to testosterone, represents an expedient therapeutic drug target. Among the compounds targeting 17βHSD3, tetrahydrodibenzazocines have been reported to be highly potent inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesized that structural analogs to the tetrahydrodibenzazocine scaffold, namely diazocines, which contain an azo group instead of the ethylene moiety, are also able to inhibit 17βHSD3. Diazocines consist of a photoresponsive core and can be isomerized from Z into E configuration by irradiation with a specific wavelength. In the present study, 17βHSD3 inhibition by diazocine photoisomers was examined in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK-293) and isolated microsomes. For this purpose, cells or microsomes were treated with androstenedione and incubated for 2 or 24 h in the presence or absence of irradiated and non-irradiated diazocines. Testosterone formation was determined by uHPLC. We report a weak inhibition of 17βHSD3 activity by diazocines in HEK-293 cells and microsomes. Furthermore, we found no significant difference between samples treated with irradiated and non-irradiated diazocines in terms of inhibition. However, we detected a new compound by HPLC analysis, which only appeared in light-treated samples, indicating a chemical modification of the photoswitched diazocines, presumably rendering them ineffective. Further investigations revealed that this modification occurs in the presence of reducing agents like dithiothreitol and glutathione. A preliminary mass-spectrometric analysis suggests that the N-N double bond is reduced, resulting in a dianiline derivative. Nevertheless, optimized photoswitchable diazocine derivatives, which are stable in a cellular environment, might serve as potent 17βHSD3 inhibitors, effective only in irradiated tissue.""","""['F Wages', 'P Lentes', 'T Griebenow', 'R Herges', 'C Peifer', 'E Maser']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Nitrogen Bridged Diazocines: Photochromes Switching within the Near-Infrared Region with High Quantum Yields in Organic Solvents and in Water.', 'Photoswitchable Azo- and Diazocine-Functionalized Derivatives of the VEGFR-2 Inhibitor Axitinib.', 'Synthesis of mono-functionalized S-diazocines via intramolecular Baeyer-Mills reactions.', 'Clinical, endocrine, and molecular findings in 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency.', 'The 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 3 deficiency: a case report of an 18-year patient and review of the literature.']"""

Objective:   To compare the oncological outcome of a patient cohort that underwent PSMA-PET imaging prior to SRT with that of a patient cohort that did not have PSMA-PET imaging before SRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 610 patients who underwent SRT, of whom 298 underwent PSMA-PET/CT prior to SRT and 312 did not. No additional hormonal therapy was prescribed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   To compare both cohorts, case-control matching was performed, using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value at the initiation of SRT, pathological grade group, pathological T stage, surgical margin status, and biochemical persistence after RARP as matching variables. The outcome variable was biochemical progression at 1 yr after SRT, defined as either a rise of PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml above the nadir after SRT or the start of additional treatment.  Results and limitations:   After case-control matching, 216 patients were matched in both cohorts (108 patients per cohort).

The RMnMels could promote M2-to-M1 macrophage repolarization via scavenging multiple reactive oxygen species and remodeling the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Following near-infrared light irradiation, RMnMels-mediated thermal ablation not only could destroy tumor cells directly, but also elicit the release of damage associated molecular patterns and tumor-associated antigens, provoking robust tumor immunogenicity and strong antitumor immune responses. The results showed that RMnMels could effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species and promote M2-to-M1 macrophage repolarization both in vitro and in vivo. Synergistically enhanced anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy was achieved following single administration of RMnMels plus single round of laser irradiation, evidenced by decreased primary tumor sizes and decreased number of distant liver metastatic nodules.

Results:   Significantly better SNR and relative CR in the prostate, rectum, bowel, penis, and penile bulb, while significantly worse in the cauda equina, were observed on the planning MRI. Significantly better ratings of image quality and artifacts were given to the planning MRI, with much less Gibbs ringing and reconstruction artifacts. Significantly better delineation value rating was achieved on the planning MRI in the prostate, seminal vesicle, rectum, penis, penile bulb, and testes, while significantly worse in the cauda equina. A strong to almost perfect interobserver rating agreement was obtained.  Conclusion:   This study suggested that CS acceleration is applicable and valuable in prostate RTP-MRI.

Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can identify groups of biologically related proteins using only protein intensity values by constructing protein correlation networks. However, WGCNA is not widespread in proteomic analyses due to challenges in implementing workflows. To facilitate the adoption of WGCNA by the proteomics field, we created MetaNetwork, an open-source, R-based application to perform sophisticated WGCNA workflows with no coding skill requirements for the end user. We demonstrate MetaNetwork's utility by employing it to identify groups of proteins associated with prostate cancer from a proteomic analysis of tumor and adjacent normal tissue samples. We found a decrease in cytoskeleton-related protein expression, a known hallmark of prostate tumors. We further identified changes in module eigenproteins indicative of dysregulation in protein translation and trafficking pathways.

Herein, we describe the synthetic access to a cohort of nine conjugated products of LAS, in which the ionophore biomolecule was successfully combined via covalent bonds with selected anticancer therapeutics or other anticancer active components. The in vitro screening of a series of cancer cell lines allowed us to identify three products with improved anticancer activity profiles compared to those of the starting materials.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is an age-dependent medical condition caused by increased activity of 5α-reductase enzyme (5α-R). Medical treatment by finasteride is considered during treatment, but it has unavoidable side effects. Hence, there is an increasing need to use natural ingredients for BPH treatment. Gingerol oil (ginger extract) is transferred by heating into zingerone. Recent studies reported the effect of zingerone on prostate cancer cells.  Aims and objectives:   The aim of the present research is to investigate the protective effect of zingerone against BPH.  Materials and methods:   Sixty male Albino Wistar rats were divided into three groups: control group, prostatic hyperplasia group treated with saline, and prostatic hyperplasia group treated with zingerone (PH-Z-G). At day 28, all rats were sacrificed, epididymis and prostate samples were collected for histopathological examination and Western blotting for androgen receptors (ARs) proteins and steroid 5 alpha-reductase 1 (SRD5A1). Human RWPE-1 prostatic cell line was assessed for viability and cycle after treated with zingerone 500 μg/day for 10 days.  Results:   PH-S group showed significant (P < 0.05) thickening of connective tissue septa associated with narrowing of acinar lumen. PH-Z group showed regain of the normal histological feature. SRD5A1 and AR expression was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in PH-Z group in comparison with PH-S group. Cell line proliferation was significantly reduced after application of zingerone with G2/M cell cycle arrest.

Methods:   Three hundred and four patients undergoing radical surgery for prostate cancer at Huadong Hospital affiliated to Fudan University between 2009 and 2020 for preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before biopsy with suspicious prostate cancer lesions. Each case was followed by a 10 + x needle combination of targeted biopsy (intentional or robotic fusion) with systematic biopsy. Prostate-specific antigen levels were measured at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively, followed by reexamination every 6 months. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method, univariate and multivariate analysis by Cox, and Logistic risk regression models.  Results:   Higher Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS) scores (p < 0.001), suspicious extracapsular invasion (p < 0.001), and seminal vesicle invasion (p < 0.001) on MRI, the largest lesion diameter on MRI (p = 0.006), higher biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group (p < 0.001) related to higher biochemical recurrence rates, higher pathological staging (p < 0.001), and a greater probability of local lymph node metastasis (p < 0.001).

Confirmation of a true-positive PSMA-avid lesion was defined as positive by histopathology, fall in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (> 50%) after targeted therapy or confirmatory further CT, MRI, PET/CT, or bone scan imaging. Regions where additional imaging was able to confirm the absence of suspicious PC lesions or regions outside exclusively targeted RT with serum PSA decline (> 50%) were counted as true-negative regions.

Methods:   The goal of this descriptive cross-sectional study was to investigate cancer patients' perceptions of COVID vaccination. Over 18 years of age who have not yet been vaccinated for COVID-19 and who agreed to participate were included in the study. We applied three questionnaires between May and June 2021, one of them was prepared by us; the other two questionnaires were The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) form and Anxiety Sensitivity index to a total of 497 participants. Chi-square, Spearmen correlation test, and multivariable multinomial logistic regression tests were used when comparing.  Results:   Our participants' ages were between 21 and 88, with a mean age of 61.38 (SD = 11.68), 48.6% (n = 251) of the participants were female. We discovered that 79.1% (n = 408) of respondents were not afraid of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. 27.7% (n = 143) of these patients were concerned about the COVID-19 vaccine's adverse effects, and 24.2% (n = 125) were afraid of its side effects with their treatments. 91.1% (n = 470) of the patients did not know which vaccine they would have and the type of the vaccine. Since the anxiety level is generally higher in women, anxiety scores were also higher in cancers seen in women, such as breast and ovarian cancer. Of course, in parallel with this, anxiety scores were lower in prostate cancers. Special patient groups should not be neglected during this vaccine season, and their concerns should be addressed.

One potential clinical target is the stem cell transcription factor SOX2, which has a critical role in prostate development and cancer. We thus investigated the impact of SOX2 expression on patient outcomes and its function within prostate cancer cells. Analyses of SOX2 expression among a case-control cohort of 1028 annotated tumor specimens demonstrated that SOX2 expression confers a more rapid time to metastasis and decreased patient survival after biochemical recurrence. SOX2 ChIP-Seq analyses revealed SOX2-binding sites within prostate cancer cells which differ significantly from canonical embryonic SOX2 gene targets, and prostate-specific SOX2 gene targets are associated with multiple oncogenic pathways. Interestingly, phenotypic and gene expression analyses after CRISPR-mediated deletion of SOX2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells, as well as ectopic SOX2 expression in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells, demonstrated that SOX2 promotes changes in multiple metabolic pathways and metabolites. SOX2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines confers increased glycolysis and glycolytic capacity, as well as increased basal and maximal oxidative respiration and increased spare respiratory capacity. Further, SOX2 expression was associated with increased quantities of mitochondria, and metabolomic analyses revealed SOX2-associated changes in the metabolism of purines, pyrimidines, amino acids and sugars, and the pentose phosphate pathway.

We therefore developed and evaluated a simple decision support scheme for optimizing prostate biopsy based on multiparametric (mp) MRI assessment.  Methods:   Total 229 patients with suspicion of PCa underwent mpMRI before combined TBx/SBx were retrospectively included. Impacts of MRI characteristics such as Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, lesion size, zonal origination, and location on biopsy performance were evaluated. A clinically available decision support scheme relying on mpMRI assessment was subsequently developed as a triage test to optimize prostate biopsy process. Cost (downgrade, upgrade, and biopsy core)-to-Effectiveness (detection rate) was systemically compared.  Results:   TBx achieved comparable detection rate to combined TBx/SBx in diagnosis of PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) (PCa, 59% [135/229] vs 60.7% [139/229]; csPCa, 45.9% [105/229] vs 47.2% [108/229]; p-values > 0.05) and outperformed SBx (PCa, 42.4% [97/229]; csPCa, 28.4% [65/229]; p-values < 0.001). Specially, in personalized decision support scheme, TBx accurately detected all PCa (72.5% [74/102]) in PI-RADS 5 and larger (≥1 cm) PI-RADS 3-4 observations, adding SBx to TBx only resulted in 1.4% (1/74) upgrading csPCa. For smaller (<1 cm) PI-RADS 3-4 lesions, combined TBx/SBx resulted in relatively higher detection rate (51.2% [65/127] vs 48.0% [61/127]) and lower upgrading rate (30.6% [15/49] vs 36.7% [18/49]) than TBx.  Conclusions:   The benefit of SBx added to TBx was largely restricted to smaller PI-RADS score 3-4 lesions. Using our personalized strategy of solo TBx for PI-RADS 5 and larger (≥1 cm) PI-RADS score 3-4 lesions would avoid excess SBx in 44.5% (102/229) of all biopsy-naïve patients without compromising detection rate.""","""['Ying Hou', 'Ke-Wen Jiang', 'Jing Zhang', 'Mei-Ling Bao', 'Hai-Bin Shi', 'Jin-Rong Qu#', 'Gong Cheng#', 'Yu-Dong Zhang#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Using Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Scores to Select an Optimal Prostate Biopsy Method: A Secondary Analysis of the Trio Study.', 'Accuracy of elastic fusion biopsy: Comparing prostate cancer detection between targeted and systematic biopsy.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Follow-up of negative MRI-targeted prostate biopsies: when are we missing cancer?', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Predictive Models in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Objective:   To identify factors associated with disparity in detection of prostate cancer between systematic and targeted biopsies in magnetic resonance imaging positive zones.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively analyzed 171 men receiving initial MR/US fusion biopsy at our institution from 2015 to 2018.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Disparity was defined as positive targeted but negative systematic biopsy within an magnetic resonance imaging-positive zone (PIRADS 3+), or vice versa. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with disparity in detection of cancer on a per lesion basis.  Results and limitation:   Three hundred and fifty-five lesions were targeted. For any cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), 37 (10%) and 24 (7%) lesions were target positive/systematic negative, respectively, while 30 (8%) and 23 (6%) lesions were target negative/systematic positive. In multivariable analysis, anterior location (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.5-11.4, P = 0.007) was associated with csPCa target positive/systematic negative disparity, while higher prostate volume (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.0-1.29, P = 0.04) was associated with csPCa target negative/systematic positive disparity. Shorter distance from apex (OR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01-1.04, P = 0.02) was associated with target positive/systematic negative disparity for any cancer. Limitations included relatively limited sample size and lack of prostatectomy specimen as a gold standard.

Optimizing the transperineal prostate biopsy template""","""Introduction and objective:   Most urologists use a 10-12 core template during transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy (TRUS-B). A similar consensus template does not exist for transperineal prostate biopsy (TP-B) including the optimal number and location of biopsy cores. We examined our institutional cohort to develop an optimal systematic template for TP-B.  Methods:   We prospectively monitored our first 200 consecutive free-hand TP-B. These included men who were biopsy naïve (n = 117), had elevated PSA with prior negative biopsy (n = 18), and men on active surveillance (n = 65). All men underwent a 20 core TP-B with each core placed in a separate specimen container. This allowed the 20-core TP-B to be easily broken down as though fewer cores had been taken in each patient. Ten, 12, and 16 core templates were designed a priori and compared within each patient to the 20 core template. The highest Grade Group (GG) at pathologic analysis was assigned to each biopsy. Primary outcome was detection of clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as ≥GG2. Secondary outcome was detection of GG1 prostate cancer. We performed sub-group analyses of biopsy naïve men and biopsy naïve men stratified by PSA density (<0.15 vs. ≥0.15 ng/mL/cc). An historic institutional cohort of 10-12 core TRUS-B (n = 170) was used to compare prostate cancer detection between techniques. P value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Clinically significant cancers were detected in 98 men (49%) using a 20 core TP-B technique. Had we sampled fewer cores we would have identified clinically significant cancers in 93 (47%, 16 core), 91 (46%, 12 core), and 82 (41%, 10 core) men. More clinically significant cancers were detected by the 20 core template compared to the 10 core template for both the whole cohort (49% vs. 41%, P = 0.02) and the biopsy naïve subset (48% vs. 40%, P = 0.05). Additional cores did not result in an increased detection of GG1 cancers (20-core: 35% vs. 10-core: 44%, P = 0.09). Less than one quarter of biopsy naïve men with a PSA density <0.15 were found to have clinically significant cancers. More clinically significant cancers were detected in the 12-core TP-B cohort compared to the 12-core TRUS-B series (46% vs. 38%, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   A 20 core TP-B systematic biopsy template detected a greater number of clinically significant prostate cancers compared to a 10 core TP template. Cancer detection was similar for 12, 16, and 20 core templates. Higher core numbers did not result in greater detection of GG1 tumors reflecting increased detection of concomitant ≥GG2 with greater sampling.

Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted in two oncology centers in Oman. Omani hospitalized patients with breast, thyroid, colorectal, stomach, and prostate cancer were recruited using convenience sampling. Participants completed Arabic versions of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to measure sleep quality, Brief Fatigue Inventory scales to measure fatigue, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy to measure HRQoL. Descriptive and inferential statistics were performed. T-test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analysis were utilized to determine predictors of HRQOL.

Results:   Among patients who underwent AS, cancer was the most common underlying disease (n = 2704, 41.3% of all AS cases). The most common cancer types were lung (14.0% of cancer-related AS cases), breast (11.0%) and prostate (10.1%). There was a slight preponderance of men compared with women (51.5% versus 48.5%). The proportion of AS cases within cancer types did not change over time. The ratio of cancer-related AS cases in relationship with all cancer-related deaths increased from 0.3% at the beginning of the study period (1999-2003) to 2.1% from 2014 to 2016 (change of age-standardized rates for men: +488%; for women: +417%).

Individuals who underwent AS because of cancer were considerably younger than those who choose AS on account of other diseases (73 years versus 80 years). The median age of people with cancer-related AS was similar to that of all cancer-related deaths (74 years): for women, the median age of cancer-related AS was 72, whereas for men it was 75.

Therefore, the aim of the present study was establishing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) threshold nomogram to predict pathologically advanced prostate cancer using the novel method of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve boosting (AUCBoost).  Methods:   The medical records of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were retrospectively reviewed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical covariates significantly associated with pathological tumor stage ≥3a. The best combination of the variables was determined by validated values of the area under the curve (AUC). The optimal individualized PSA threshold values were developed using AUCBoost.  Results:   In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, PSA, prostate volume, clinical tumor stage, Gleason Grade Group, the number of positive cores, and the percentage of positive cores were independent predictive factors for pathological tumor stage ≥3a. A combination model comprising PSA, prostate volume, clinical tumor stage, percent positive core, and Gleason Grade Group produced the highest AUC for predicting pathological tumor stage ≥3a (AUC = 0.777). The PSA threshold values for detecting pathological tumor stage ≥3a were calculated and a table of individualized PSA threshold nomogram was developed using AUCBoost.

In this paper, the authors show the reproducibility of the method on a set of prostate patients, quantifying the dependencies of the achievable benefit with respect to conventional and hypofractionated schemes and the sensitivity of the method to setup errors and range uncertainty.Approach.On a cohort of 9 patients, non-uniform IMPT plans were optimised and compared to conventional and hypofractionated schedules. For each patient, the comparison of the three strategies has been based on the output of the cost function used to optimise the treatments. The analysis has been repeated considering differentα/βratios for the tumour, namely 1.5, 3 and 4.5 Gy. For a single patient, setup errors and beam range uncertainty have been analysed: the plans, for each optimisation strategy, have been iteratively forward planned 500 times with randomly varying the patient position in each fraction, and 200 times for systematic range shift.Main results.An average 10% benefit has been shown for the lowestα/βratio considered for the tumour, where the non-uniform schedule generally converges to hypofractionation; the benefit decreases to 5%-7% for higherα/βratios, for which the non-uniform schedule always showed better outcomes with respect to the other fractionation schedules. An increased sensitivity to uncertainty, especially for setup errors, has been shown, which can be associated to the spatial non-uniformity of the dose distributions peculiar of the spatiotemporal plans.Significance.This work represents the first investigation of spatiotemporal fractionation for prostate cancer and the beginning of further investigations before clinical implementation can be considered.""","""['L Manganaro', 'A Attili', 'T Bortfeld', 'H Paganetti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological impact of intensity modulated proton therapy and RapidArc planning for high-risk prostate cancer with seminal vesicles.', 'Comparison of linear and nonlinear programming approaches for ""worst case dose"" and ""minmax"" robust optimization of intensity-modulated proton therapy dose distributions.', 'Robust radiotherapy planning.', 'Empowering Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy Through Physics and Technology: An Overview.']"""

However, characterizing prostate lesions aggressiveness in mp-MRI sequences is impossible in clinical practice, and biopsy remains the reference to determine the Gleason score (GS). In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end multi-class network that jointly segments the prostate gland and cancer lesions with GS group grading. After encoding the information on a latent space, the network is separated in two branches: 1) the first branch performs prostate segmentation 2) the second branch uses this zonal prior as an attention gate for the detection and grading of prostate lesions. The model was trained and validated with a 5-fold cross-validation on a heterogeneous series of 219 MRI exams acquired on three different scanners prior prostatectomy. In the free-response receiver operating characteristics (FROC) analysis for clinically significant lesions (defined as GS >6) detection, our model achieves 69.0%±14.5% sensitivity at 2.9 false positive per patient on the whole prostate and 70.8%±14.4% sensitivity at 1.5 false positive when considering the peripheral zone (PZ) only. Regarding the automatic GS group grading, Cohen's quadratic weighted kappa coefficient (κ) is 0.418±0.138, which is the best reported lesion-wise kappa for GS segmentation to our knowledge. The model has encouraging generalization capacities with κ=0.120±0.092 on the PROSTATEx-2 public dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance for the segmentation of the whole prostate gland with a Dice of 0.875±0.013.

Here, we find that NCAPD3 is high-expression and up-regulates the levels of EZH2 and MALAT1 in PCa. In detail, high expression of NCAPD3 increases the levels of transcription factor STAT3 and E2F1 and recruits more STAT3 and E2F1 to the promoter of EZH2 gene and more STAT3 to the promoter of MALAT1 gene, and then results in the increasing expression of both EZH2 and MALAT1 in PCa cells. In vitro and in vivo functional characterization reveals that overexpression of NCAPD3 enhances the growth of PCa cells, while knockdown of NCAPD3 impairs the growth of PCa cells. Together, our data demonstrate that NCAPD3 is a tumor-promoting factor which enhances the progression of PCa by up-regulating EZH2 and MALAT1.""","""['Zuolei Jing', 'Qianmei Liu', 'Wanlin Xie', 'Yong Wei', 'Jiale Liu', 'Yi Zhang', 'Wenren Zuo', 'Shan Lu', 'Qingyi Zhu', 'Ping Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['NCAPD3 enhances Warburg effect through c-myc and E2F1 and promotes the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer.', 'Regulatory mechanism of androgen receptor on NCAPD3 gene expression in prostate cancer.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA MALAT1 enhances oncogenic activities of EZH2 in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Methylation-dependent and -independent roles of EZH2 synergize in CDCA8 activation in prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial DNA methylation is a predictor of immunotherapy response and prognosis in breast cancer: scRNA-seq and bulk-seq data insights.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.', 'NCAPD3 enhances Warburg effect through c-myc and E2F1 and promotes the occurrence and progression of colorectal cancer.']"""

The ongoing research has mainly involved observational studies, which are often prone to confounding. This study aimed to identify the relationship between genetically predicted blood lipid concentrations and PCa.  Methods and findings:   Data for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A (apoA) and B (apoB), lipoprotein A (Lp(a)), and PCa were acquired from genome-wide association studies in UK Biobank and the PRACTICAL consortium, respectively. We used a two-sample summary-level Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach with both univariable and multivariable (MVMR) models and utilised a variety of robust methods and sensitivity analyses to assess the possibility of MR assumptions violation. No association was observed between genetically predicted concentrations of HDL, TG, apoA and apoB, and PCa risk. Genetically predicted LDL concentration was positively associated with total PCa in the univariable analysis, but adjustment for HDL, TG, and Lp(a) led to a null association. Genetically predicted concentration of Lp(a) was associated with higher total PCa risk in the univariable (ORweighted median per standard deviation (SD) = 1.091; 95% CI 1.028 to 1.157; P = 0.004) and MVMR analyses after adjustment for the other lipid traits (ORIVW per SD = 1.068; 95% CI 1.005 to 1.134; P = 0.034). Genetically predicted Lp(a) was also associated with advanced (MVMR ORIVW per SD = 1.078; 95% CI 0.999 to 1.163; P = 0.055) and early age onset PCa (MVMR ORIVW per SD = 1.150; 95% CI 1.015,1.303; P = 0.028). Although multiple estimation methods were utilised to minimise the effect of pleiotropy, the presence of any unmeasured pleiotropy cannot be excluded and may limit our findings.  Conclusions:   We observed that genetically predicted Lp(a) concentrations were associated with an increased PCa risk. Future studies are required to understand the underlying biological pathways of this finding, as it may inform PCa prevention through Lp(a)-lowering strategies.""","""['Anna Ioannidou', 'Eleanor L Watts', 'Aurora Perez-Cornago', 'Elizabeth A Platz', 'Ian G Mills', 'Timothy J Key', 'Ruth C Travis;PRACTICAL consortium', ' CRUK', ' BPC', ' CAPS', ' PEGASUS;Konstantinos K Tsilidis', 'Verena Zuber']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['The causal effects of lipid traits on kidney function in Africans: bidirectional and multivariable Mendelian-randomization study.', 'Evaluating the relationship between circulating lipoprotein lipids and apolipoproteins with risk of coronary heart disease: A multivariable Mendelian randomisation analysis.', 'The Relationship between Blood Lipids and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation: Univariable and Multivariable Mendelian Randomization Analysis.', 'Genetic Association of Lipids and Lipid Drug Targets With Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Meta-analysis.', 'Mendelian randomization to assess causal effects of blood lipids on coronary heart disease: lessons from the past and applications to the future.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Irritability and risk of lung cancer: a Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis.', 'Ten interleukins and risk of prostate cancer.', 'Association between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and prostate cancer risk: A Mendelian randomisation study.', 'Can Diet Prevent Urological Cancers?

Treatment is frequently intensified by electively treating the pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) with whole pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT), but practice patterns and the benefits of WPRT are not well defined. We hypothesized that men treated with WPRT would have improved overall survival (OS) relative to men treated with prostate-only radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   National Cancer Database records of men diagnosed between 2008-2015 with UIR-PCa or HR-PCa and treated with prostate EBRT±androgen deprivation therapy (72-86.4 Gy) with (15,175) or without (13,549) WPRT were reviewed. Risk of LN involvement was calculated using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center nomogram. Measured confounders were balanced with inverse probability of treatment weighting and OS hazard ratios (HRs) were generated using multivariable Cox regression.  Results:   Of the men, 53% received WPRT. Every 1% increase in risk of LN involvement correlated with a 1% increase in risk of death (p <0.001). WPRT trended toward improved OS in all men with UIR-PCa and HR-PCa (HR: 0.95 [95% CI: 0.90-1.006], p=0.055). WPRT correlated with improved OS in men with Gleason 9 and 10 disease (HR: 0.87 [0.78-0.98], p=0.02) or risk of LN involvement ≥10% (HR: 0.93 [0.87-0.99], p=0.03).  Conclusions:   Men with higher LN risk scores and Gleason grade benefited from WPRT. These results complement the recent POP-RT randomized trial in mostly positron emission tomography/computerized tomography-staged patients, demonstrating that a more heterogeneous population of men staged without functional imaging benefits from WPRT.""","""['Neal Andruska', 'Benjamin W Fischer-Valuck', 'Michael Waters', 'Elizabeth Juarez Diaz', 'Temitope Agabalogun', 'Eric H Kim', 'Zachary L Smith', 'Randall J Brenneman', 'Hiram A Gay', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Brian C Baumann']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Assessing the impact of brachytherapy boost and androgen deprivation therapy on survival outcomes for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Prostate-only Versus Whole-pelvis Radiation with or Without a Brachytherapy Boost for Gleason Grade Group 5 Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Analysis.', 'Survival Outcomes of Whole-Pelvic Versus Prostate-Only Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients With Use of the National Cancer Data Base.', 'Variation in the Prescription of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radiotherapy in the Netherlands, and Adherence to European Association of Urology Guidelines: A Population-based Study.', 'Long-Term Outcomes of Patients on a Phase II Prospective Trial of Oligometastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen Deprivation and External Beam Radiation.']"""

Nevertheless, direct quantification of exosomes in biological fluid, especially in point-of-care tests (POCTs), remains extremely challenging. Herein, we developed a sensitive and portable electrochemical biosensor in combination with smartphones for quantitative analysis of exosomes. The improved double-antibody sandwich method-based poly-enzyme signal amplification was adopted to detect exosomes. We could detect as low as 7.23 ng of CD63-positive exosomes in 5 μL of serum within 2 h. Importantly, we demonstrated that the biosensor worked well with microliter-level serum and cell culture supernatant. The biosensor holds great potential for the detection of CD-63-expressing exosomes in early diagnosis of prostate disease because CD63-positive exosomes were less detected from the prostate patient serum. Also, the biosensor was used to monitor the secretion of exosomes with the drug therapy, showing a close relationship between the secretion of exosomes and the concentration of cisplatin.

Methods:   This prospective observational cohort study was performed in a PACU at a high-volume prostate cancer center. We used a convenience sample of patients > 60 years undergoing elective radical prostatectomy. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular or neurodegenerative disease were excluded. Fifteen, 30, 45, and 60 following extubation, patients were screened for signs of delirium with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Three months after surgery self-reported cognitive function was assessed with the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, and health status was evaluated with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).  Results:   Signs of PACU delirium were present in 32.4% (n = 72/222) of patients, and 80.2% (n = 178/222) completed the 3-month follow-up.

We compared pre-biopsy urine scores with ERSPC and PCPT multivariate risk calculator scores for men with GG1 at biopsy to post-RP pathology.  Results:   Urine EPI scores were significantly lower in men with GG1 at biopsy than in men with > GG1 (p = 0.04), while there were no differences in multivariate risk scores used in standard clinical practice (p > 0.05).

Results:   Among the 105 patients included in the analysis (65 [6.19%] women; median age, 59 [range, 31-81] years), the primary end point was met within a noninferiority margin of 0.65 days, with a mean difference of 0.52 days (98.52% CI, 0.40-0.65 days). Grade 4 neutropenia frequency in cycle 1 was not significantly different. Plinabulin had earlier onset of action with less grade 4 neutropenia in week 1 of cycle 1. Plinabulin had fewer adverse clinical consequences with rates of febrile neutropenia (0 of 52 vs 1 of 53 [1.9%]), infections (4 of 52 [7.7%] vs 8 of 53 [15.1%]), chemotherapy dose delay of more than 7 days (2 of 52 [3.8%] vs 3 of 53 [5.7%]), and permanent chemotherapy discontinuation (7 of 52 [13.5%] vs 14 of 53 [26.4%]). Patients receiving plinabulin had significantly less bone pain (difference, -0.67 [95% CI, -1.17 to -0.16]; P = .01) and a better immunosuppressive profile (NLR >5 at day 8, 2 of 52 [3.8%] vs 24 of 51 [46.0%]; P < .001). Plinabulin was well tolerated, with comparable safety to pegfilgrastim.  Conclusions and relevance:   Plinabulin has comparable efficacy to pegfilgrastim for the prevention of CIN, with better safety and a better immunosuppressive profile. Plinabulin's same-day dosing compared with pegfilgrastim's next-day dosing offers distinct advantages, including reducing use of health care services.

The primary purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of Varian Ethos IOE for auto-planning and intercompare different treatment modalities within the Ethos treatment planning system (TPS). A total of 36 retrospective prostate and proximal seminal vesicles cases were selected for this study. The prescription dose was 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions to the proximal seminal vesicles, with a simultaneous integrated boost of 70 Gy to the prostate gland. Based on RT intent, three treatment plans were auto-generated in the Ethos TPS and were exported to the Eclipse TPS for intercomparison with the Eclipse treatment plan. When normalized for the same planning target volume (PTV) coverage, Ethos plans Dmax% were 108.1 ± 1.2%, 108.4 ± 1.6%, and 109.6 ± 2.0%, for the 9-field IMRT, 12-field IMRT, and 2-full arc VMAT plans, respectively. This compared well with Eclipse plan Dmax% values, which was 108.8 ± 1.4%. OAR indices were also evaluated for Ethos plans using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group report 0415 as a guide and were found to be comparable to each other and the Eclipse plans. While all Ethos plans were comparable, we found that, in general, the Ethos 12-field IMRT plans met most of the dosimetric goals for treatment. Also, Ethos IOE consistently generated dosimetrically hotter VMAT plans versus IMRT plans. On average, Ethos TPS took 13 min to generate 2-full arc VMAT plans, compared to 5 min for 12-field IMRT plans. Varian Ethos TPS can generate multiple treatment plans in an efficient time frame and the quality of the plans could be deemed clinically acceptable when compared to manually generated treatment plans.""","""['Shyam Pokharel', 'Abilio Pacheco', 'Suzanne Tanner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Assessment of semi-automated stereotactic treatment planning for online adaptive radiotherapy in ethos.', 'A treatment planning study comparing Elekta VMAT and fixed field IMRT using the varian treatment planning system eclipse.', 'Evaluation of an automated template-based treatment planning system for radiotherapy of anal, rectal and prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric comparison of two treatment planning systems for spine SBRT.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy vs. c-IMRT in esophageal cancer: a treatment planning comparison.', 'Prospective In Silico Evaluation of Cone-Beam Computed Tomography-Guided StereoTactic Adaptive Radiation Therapy (CT-STAR) for the Ablative Treatment of Ultracentral Thoracic Disease.', 'A roadmap for implementation of kV-CBCT online adaptive radiation therapy and initial first year experiences.', 'The first reported case of a patient with pancreatic cancer treated with cone beam computed tomography-guided stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (CT-STAR).']"""

For example, targeted sequencing provides a flexible, rapid, and cost-effective method for genomic assessment of patient-derived cell lines to evaluate fidelity to initial patient tumor samples.  Methods:   We developed a prostate cancer-specific targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel to detect alterations in 62 prostate cancer-associated genes as well as recurring gene fusions with ETS family members, representing the majority of common alterations in prostate cancer. We tested this panel on primary prostate cancer tissues and blood biopsies from patients with metastatic prostate cancer. We generated patient-derived cell lines from primary prostate cancers using conditional reprogramming methods and applied targeted sequencing to evaluate the fidelity of these cell lines to the original patient tumors.  Results:   The prostate cancer-specific panel identified biologically and clinically relevant alterations, including point mutations in driver oncogenes and ETS family fusion genes, in tumor tissues from 29 radical prostatectomy samples. The targeted panel also identified genomic alterations in cell-free DNA and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with metastatic prostate cancer, and in standard prostate cancer cell lines. We used the targeted panel to sequence our set of patient-derived cell lines; however, no prostate cancer-specific mutations were identified in the tumor-derived cell lines, suggesting preferential outgrowth of normal prostate epithelial cells.  Conclusions:   We evaluated a prostate cancer-specific targeted NGS panel to detect common and clinically relevant alterations (including ETS family gene fusions) in prostate cancer. The panel detected driver mutations in a diverse set of clinical samples of prostate cancer, including fresh-frozen tumors, cell-free DNA, CTCs, and cell lines. Targeted sequencing of patient-derived cell lines highlights the challenge of deriving cell lines from primary prostate cancers and the importance of genomic characterization to credential candidate cell lines.

Limited literature exists studying this topic. Our aim was to identify whether full-length femur radiographs are of diagnostic and therapeutic value in this demographic.  Methods:   A retrospective observational analysis of the patients admitted with a neck of femur fracture over a 5-year period (2015-2020) using the National Hip Fracture Database was performed at a major trauma centre. Electronic patient records were accessed to screen the NOF patients who had co-existing malignancy and subsequently underwent a full-length femur radiograph. In addition to patient demographics, we also identified the plan and whether it was affected by findings of the full-length radiograph, the operation performed, any additional investigations undertaken for malignancy, the type of cancer, complications and 1-year mortality.  Results:   Of the 2416 patients screened, 18% had a co-existing malignancy (n = 431). Of the 431 with underlying malignancy, 424 patients underwent a full-length femur radiograph while only seven of these radiographs identified lesions. From the seven patients with findings of metastatic deposits on full-length radiographs, none required an alternative operation to that which they normally would undergo. Furthermore, no patients required a longer stem arthroplasty or longer internal fixation. One in four fractures was associated with co-existing breast malignancy (26.5%, n = 114), followed by prostate cancer (14.8%, n = 64). Colorectal, lung, bladder and skin (squamous cell carcinoma) contributed 6-10% (n = 44, 40, 33, 29, respectively). Other malignancies contributed to the rest of the 25%.

Targeted PCa screening may decrease PCa-specific mortality. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is the most reliable and widely accepted tumor biomarker for screening and monitoring PCa status. However, in many settings, quantification of serum PSA requires access to centralized laboratories. In this study, we describe a proof-of-concept rapid test combined with a highly portable Cube™ reader for quantification of total PSA from a drop of serum within 20 min. We demonstrated the application of gold nanoshells as a label for lateral flow assay with significant increase in the measured colorimetric signal intensity to achieve five times lower detection limit when compared to the traditionally used 40 nm gold nanosphere labels, without a need for any additional signal amplification steps. We first optimized and evaluated the performance of the assay with commercially available total PSA calibrators. For initial validation with commercially available ACCESS Hybritech PSA calibrator, a detection range of 0.5-150 ng/mL was achieved. We compared the performance of our total PSA test with IMMULITE analyzer for quantification of total PSA in archived human serum samples. On preliminary testing with archived serums samples and comparison with IMMULITE total PSA assay, a correlation of 0.95 (p < .0001) was observed. The highly portable quantitative screening test for PSA described in this study has the potential to make PCa screening more accessible where diagnostic labs and automated immunoassay systems are not available, to reduce therapeutic turnaround time, to streamline clinical care, and to direct patient care for both initial screening and for post-treatment monitoring of patients.""","""['Balaji Srinivasan', 'David M Nanus', 'David Erickson', 'Saurabh Mehta']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Curr Res Biotechnol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'An Ultra-Rapid Biosensory Point-of-Care (POC) Assay for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Detection in Human Serum.', 'A novel carboxyl polymer-modified upconversion luminescent nanoprobe for detection of prostate-specific antigen in the clinical gray zonebase by flow immunoassay strip.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Dormant cancer cells are treatment-resistant and responsible for cancer recurrence and metastasis. Prostate cancer treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) often enters a dormant state. ADT-induced prostate cancer dormancy remains poorly understood due to the challenge in acquiring clinical dormant prostate cancer cells and the lack of representative models. In this study, we aimed to develop clinically relevant models for studying ADT-induced prostate cancer dormancy. Dormant prostate cancer models were established by castrating mice bearing patient-derived xenografts (PDX) of hormonal naïve or sensitive prostate cancer. Dormancy status and tumor relapse were monitored and evaluated. Paired pre- and postcastration (dormant) PDX tissues were subjected to morphologic and transcriptome profiling analyses. As a result, we established eleven ADT-induced dormant prostate cancer models that closely mimicked the clinical courses of ADT-treated prostate cancer. We identified two ADT-induced dormancy subtypes that differed in morphology, gene expression, and relapse rates. We discovered transcriptomic differences in precastration PDXs that predisposed the dormancy response to ADT. We further developed a dormancy subtype-based, predisposed gene signature that was significantly associated with ADT response in hormonal naïve prostate cancer and clinical outcome in castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with ADT or androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors.

Despite this main field of application, prostate MRI can be utilized to obtain information in a variety of benign disorders of the prostate.  Methods:   Systematic bibliographical research with extraction of studies, national (German) as well as international guidelines (EAU, AUA), and consensus reports on MRI of benign disorders of the prostate was performed. Indications and imaging findings of prostate MRI were identified for a) imaging the enlarged prostate, b) prostate MRI in prostatic artery embolization, c) imaging in prostatitis and d) imaging in congenital anomalies.  Results and conclusions:   Different phenotypes of the enlarged prostate that partly correlate with severity of symptoms are discussed. We provide an overview of the different types of prostatitis and possible imaging findings, highlighting abscesses as a severe complication. The most common congenital anomalies of the prostate are utricular cysts, whereas anomalies like aplasia, hypoplasia, and ectopia are rare disorders. Knowledge of indications for imaging and imaging appearance of these conditions may improve patient care and enhance differential diagnosis.  Key points:   · Current guidelines do not implement indications for mpMRI apart from prostate carcinoma.. · MRI can distinguish different anatomical phenotypes of prostatic enlargement.. · Prostatic artery embolization represents a valuable treatment option in cases of symptomatic benign prostatic enlargement.. · Different forms of prostatitis exist and may mimic prostate carcinoma in MRI.. · MRI can be used to evaluate anatomical prostate anomalies..

Materials and methods:   Density measurements included the ratio of endogenous testosterone (ET), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and percentage of biopsy positive cores (BPC) on prostate volume (ETD, PSAD, and BPCD, respectively). The ratio of percentage of cancer invading the gland (tumor load, TL) on prostate weight (TLD) was also calculated. Unfavorable disease (UD) was defined as tumor upgrading (ISUP >3) and/or upstaging (pT >2) and/or lymph node invasion (LNI). Associations of ETD with features of aggressive PCa, including UD and TLD, were evaluated by logistic and linear regression models.  Results:   Evaluated cases were 338. Subjects with upgrading, upstaging, and LNI were 61/338 (18%), 73/338 (21%), and 25/338 (7.4%), respectively. TLD correlated with UD (Pearson's correlation coefficient, r = 0.204; p < 0.0001), PSAD (r = 0.342; p < 0.0001), BPCD (r = 0.364; p < 0.0001), and ETD (r = 0.214; p < 0.0001), which also correlated with BMI (r = -0.223; p < 0.0001), PSAD (r = 0.391; p < 0.0001), and BPCD (r = 0.407; p < 0.0001). TLD was the strongest independent predictor of UD (OR = 2.244; 95% CI = 1.146-4.395; p = 0.018). In the multivariate linear regression model predicting BPCD, ETD was an independent predictor (linear regression coefficient, b = 0.026; 95% CI: 0.016-0.036; p < 0.0001) together with PSAD (b = 1.599; 95% CI: 0.863-2.334; p < 0.0001) and TLD (b = 0.489; 95% CI: 0.274-0.706; p < 0.0001). According to models, TLD increased as ETD increased accordingly, but mean ET levels were significantly lower for patients with UD.  Conclusions:   As ETD measurements incremented, the risk of large tumors extending beyond the prostate increased accordingly, and patients with lower ET levels were more likely to occult UD.

Evidence in support of a role for nonselective β-blockers (nsBBs) in cancer treatment is increasing, and counteracting cancer recurrence associated with perioperative stress and catecholamine is one of the suggested mechanisms of action.  Objective:   To explore whether use of nsBBs at the time of radical prostatectomy is associated with a lower rate of treatment for prostate cancer recurrence.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study analyzed prospectively collected data from the Cancer Registry of Norway, Norwegian Patient Registry, Norwegian Prescription Database, and Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. Of 12 298 eligible patients, this study included 11 117 treatment-naive patients with prostate cancer (ie, no prior hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy) who underwent radical prostatectomy in Norway from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2015, with a minimum progression-free follow-up of 6 months. Data analysis was performed from April 20, 2020, to April 30, 2021.  Exposures:   Use of nsBBs and selective β-blockers (sBBs) at time of radical prostatectomy.  Main outcomes and measures:   Treatment for cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy (defined as initiation of hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy) or, if no treatment was identified, cancer-specific mortality.  Results:   The study included 11 117 men with prostate cancer (median [IQR] age at radical prostatectomy, 64.8 [60.4-68.3] years). Of these, 1622 (14.6%) later received treatment for cancer recurrence during a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR, 2.4-6.3 years). Use of nsBBs at time of surgery among 209 patients was significantly associated with a lower risk of treatment for cancer recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42-0.96; P = .03). No such association was observed for use of sBBs (aHR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84-1.11; P = .62). Subanalyses with (1) relaxed inclusion criteria allowing for inclusion also of patients with early progression (within 6 months) and (2) only the healthiest patients (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0) supported the main findings.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, use of nsBB but not sBBs at the time of radical prostatectomy was associated with less treatment initiation for cancer recurrence. This finding, together with accumulated preclinical and clinical evidence, provides a foundation for initiation of an interventional study.""","""['Shivanthe Sivanesan', 'Kristin Austlid Taskén', 'Helene Hartvedt Grytli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Use of statins and prostate cancer recurrence among patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Association between use of β-blockers and prostate cancer-specific survival: a cohort study of 3561 prostate cancer patients with high-risk or metastatic disease.', 'Prostate cancer-specific survival following salvage radiotherapy vs observation in men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and salvage radiotherapy.', 'Perioperative biobehavioral interventions to prevent cancer recurrence through combined inhibition of β-adrenergic and cyclooxygenase 2 signaling.', 'Pan-Cancer Characterization of Intratumoral Autonomic Innervation in 32 Cancer Types in the Cancer Genome Atlas.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 538 consecutive men who underwent MRI-TRUS fusion TB and concomitant systematic biopsy were evaluated. IPP on MRI was independently measured by 4 blinded reviewers. The primary outcome was per-lesion detection of csPCa on TB. We assessed the association between IPP and csPCa detection on TB, controlling for age, prostate specific antigen, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System® (PI-RADS®) score, prostate volume, targeted cores sampled and previous biopsy experience.  Results:   A total of 847 PI-RADS 3 or greater lesions were targeted across 570 biopsies. Intra- and interrater reliability for measuring IPP was strong. A total of 81 (14.2%), 127 (22.3%), 237 (41.6%) and 125 (21.9%) men had 0, small, medium and large IPP, respectively. A total of 230, 392 and 196 lesions were PI-RADS 3, 4 and 5, respectively. Of the lesions 198 (34.7%) had csPCa on TB. The overall relationship between IPP size and csPCa found on TB was not significant; however, large IPP is associated with a significantly lower rate of csPCa detection than 0 IPP (p=0.007). Every mm increase in IPP is associated with a 5.6% decrease in the odds of csPCa detection on TB (p=0.004) and a 66.5% decrease in odds of detection in large IPP compared to 0 IPP (p=0.003).  Conclusions:   As the size of the IPP and volume increase, there is a decrease in the detection rate of csPCa on MRI-guided TB.

Methods:   Diagnostic and treatment activity between 23 March (start of first national lockdown in England) and 31 December 2020 was compared with the same calendar period in 2019. Patients newly diagnosed with PCa were identified from national rapid cancer registration data linked to other electronic healthcare datasets.  Results:   There was a 30.8% reduction (22 419 vs 32 409) in the number of men with newly diagnosed PCa in 2020 after the start of the first lockdown, compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Men diagnosed in 2020 were typically at a more advanced stage (Stage IV: 21.2% vs 17.4%) and slightly older (57.9% vs 55.9% ≥ 70 years; P < 0.001). Prostate biopsies in 2020 were more often performed using transperineal (TP) routes (64.0% vs 38.2%). The number of radical prostatectomies in 2020 was reduced by 26.9% (3896 vs 5331) and the number treated by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) by 14.1% (9719 vs 11 309). Other changes included an increased use of EBRT with hypofractionation and reduced use of docetaxel chemotherapy in men with hormone-sensitive metastatic PCa (413 vs 1519) with related increase in the use of enzalutamide.  Conclusion:   We found substantial deficits in the number of diagnostic and treatment procedures for men with newly diagnosed PCa after the start of the first lockdown in 2020. The number of men diagnosed with PCa decreased by about one-third and those diagnosed had more advanced disease. Treatment patterns shifted towards those that limit the risk of COVID-19 exposure including increased use of TP biopsy, hypofractionated radiation, and enzalutamide.

High-burden disease was defined as the presence of four or more bone metastases and/or visceral metastasis.  Results:   Of 2048 patients, 702 (34.3%) and 1346 (65.7%) patients were classified as the low- and high-burden groups, respectively. In each group, >80% of the patients were treated with combined androgen blockade. Although there was no significant between-group difference in the overall survival according to the androgen deprivation therapy method, in the high-burden group the progression-free survival of the combined androgen blockade-treated patients was significantly better than that of patients treated with castration monotherapy: inverse probability of treatment weighting method, hazard ratio 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.71; instrumental variables method, hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.60-0.98.  Conclusion:   In the high-burden group, combined androgen blockade with a first-generation anti-androgen resulted in superior progression-free survival compared with castration monotherapy. For well-selected metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients, the use of combined androgen blockade might still have some suitable scenarios.""","""['Yoshiyuki Nagumo', 'Mizuki Onozawa', 'Takahiro Kojima', 'Naoki Terada', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Koji Mitsuzuka', 'Hiroaki Yasumoto', 'Hiroaki Matsumoto', 'Hideki Enokida', 'Takayuki Sugiyama', 'Kentaro Kuroiwa', 'Toshihiro Saito', 'Akira Yokomizo', 'Naoki Kohei', 'Ken-Ichi Tabata', 'Atsushi Takahashi', 'Mikio Sugimoto', 'Hiroshi Kitamura', 'Toshiyuki Kamoto', 'Hiroyuki Nishiyama;Japanese Urological Oncology Group (JUOG)']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Japan Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment for combined androgen blockade including bicalutamide: clinical application and validation.', 'Prognostic Factors in Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients Treated With Combined Androgen Blockade: A Consecutive 15-year Study at a Single Japanese Institute.', 'Variations in circulating sex steroid levels in metastatic prostate cancer patients with combined androgen blockade: observation and implication.', 'Advantages of total androgen blockade in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Humoral response after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination in patients with prostate cancer using steroids.']"""

The research of miRNAs can promote the prevention and drug research of specific diseases. However, there are still many undiscovered links between miRNAs and diseases, which greatly limits the research of miRNAs. Therefore, for exploring the unknown miRNA-disease associations, we combine the graph random propagation network based on DropFeature with attention network to propose a novel deep learning model to predict the miRNA-disease associations (GRPAMDA). Specifically, we firstly construct the miRNA-disease heterogeneous graph based on miRNA-disease association information. Secondly, we adopt DropFeature to randomly delete the features of nodes in the graph and then perform propagation operations to enhance the features of miRNA and disease nodes. Thirdly, we employ the attention mechanism to fuse the features of random propagation by aggregating the enhanced neighbor features of miRNA and disease nodes. Finally, miRNA-disease association scores are generated by a fully connected layer. The average area under the curve of GRPAMDA model based on 5-fold cross-validation is 93.46% on HMDD v2.0. Case studies of esophageal tumors, lymphomas and prostate tumors show that 48, 47 and 46 of the top 50 miRNAs associated with these diseases are confirmed by dbDEMC and miR2Disease database, respectively. In short, the GRPAMDA model can be used as a valuable method to study miRNA-disease associations.""","""['Tangbo Zhong', 'Zhengwei Li', 'Zhu-Hong You', 'Ru Nie', 'Huan Zhao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Brief Bioinform""","""['MDHGI: Matrix Decomposition and Heterogeneous Graph Inference for miRNA-disease association prediction.', 'Predicting miRNA-disease associations based on PPMI and attention network.', 'GIMDA: Graphlet interaction-based MiRNA-disease association prediction.', 'FCGCNMDA: predicting miRNA-disease associations by applying fully connected graph convolutional networks.', 'MicroRNAs and complex diseases: from experimental results to computational models.', 'Dihydroartemisinin inhibits the activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells by regulating miR‑29b‑3p.', 'miRdisNET: Discovering microRNA biomarkers that are associated with diseases utilizing biological knowledge-based machine learning.', 'RLFDDA: a meta-path based graph representation learning model for drug-disease association prediction.', 'SVMMDR: Prediction of miRNAs-drug resistance using support vector machines based on heterogeneous network.']"""

Because common mechanisms for aggressive disease are expected, we explored a large panel of DDR genes and pathways to demonstrate that DDR alterations contribute to development of aggressive prostate cancer in both African American and European American men.  Methods:   We performed a case-case study of 764 African American and European American men with lethal or indolent prostate cancer treated at 4 US hospitals. We calculated carrier frequencies of germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic sequence variants within 306 DDR genes, summarized by DDR pathway, and compared lethal cases against indolent cases using 2-sided Fisher's exact tests. Secondary analysis examined if carrier frequencies differed by ancestry.  Results:   Lethal cases were more likely to carry a pathogenic sequence variant in a DDR gene compared with indolent cases (18.5% vs 9.6%, P = 4.30 × 10-4), even after excluding BRCA2 (14.6% vs 9.6%, P = .04). The carrier frequency was similar among lethal cases of African (16.7% including and 15.8% excluding BRCA2) and lethal cases of European (19.3% including and 14.2% excluding BRCA2) ancestry. Three DDR pathways were statistically significantly associated with lethal disease: homologous recombination (P = .003), Fanconi anemia (P = .002), and checkpoint factor (P = .02).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that altered DDR is an important mechanism for aggressive prostate cancer not only in men of European but also of African ancestry.

Moreover, the limited survival benefit observed in only a proportion of patients receiving novel therapeutics including immune checkpoint blockade and PARP inhibitors suggests the biological heterogeneity of mCRPCs.  Methods:   To understand the heterogeneity of mCRPC, we analyzed the transcriptome of 231 mCRPCs and identified four disparate biological subtypes (Basal, Homologous Recombination Repair (HRR), Neuroendocrine and Luminal). The package ""randomForest"" was used to construct a Random Forest model. Circular plots were used for visualization of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in each subtype.  Results:   The Luminal subtype of mCRPCs has higher Androgen Receptor (AR) expression and copy number alterations as compared with the other subtypes. Genes in HRR pathway are relatively downregulated in most subtypes regardless of the genetic alterations, except for the HRR and NE subtypes, suggesting potential resistance of the HRR and NE mCRPCs to PARP inhibitor treatment. The HRR subtype has relatively more immune cell infiltration and higher expression of immune checkpoints, highlighting that the efficacy of immunotherapy should be evaluated in this particular subtype. TMPRSS2-ERG fusion is the most frequent gene fusion in all mCRPCs, and the Basal subtype has a higher frequency of this fusion than the other subtypes.  Conclusions:   Our results reveal that the stratification of mCRPC according to transcriptome is informative of personalized therapeutics in the treatment of mCRPCs.

Retrospective studies have shown that metformin use is associated with decreased incidence of prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Preclinical studies suggesting additive anticancer effects of combining metformin and bicalutamide prompted this clinical trial (NCT02614859).  Methods:   This open-label, randomized, phase 2 trial enrolled non-diabetic patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer, a PSADT of 3-9 months, BMI > 25 and normal testosterone. Patients were randomized 1:2 to observation for an initial 8 weeks (Arm A) or metformin 1000 mg twice daily (Arm B). Bicalutamide 50 mg/day was added after 8 weeks to both arms. The primary objective was to evaluate the number of patients with undetectable PSA ( < 0.2 ng/mL) at the end of 32 weeks. Immune correlatives were assessed as exploratory endpoints.  Results:   A total of 29 patients were enrolled from March 2015 to January 2020. No difference was seen between the 2 arms in the proportion of patients with undetectable PSA. Modest PSA decrease ranging from 4% to 24% were seen in 40.0% (95% CI: 19.1-64.0%) of patients with metformin monotherapy, compared to 11.1% (95% CI: 0.3-48.3%) in the observation arm. Metformin monotherapy reduced PD-1+ NK cells, and increased NKG2D+ NK cells. The combination of metformin and bicalutamide led to greater reductions in PD-1 expressing NK, CD4+ T, and CD8+ T-cell subsets compared to bicalutamide alone. The trial was stopped early due to predicted inability to achieve its primary endpoint.  Conclusions:   Although metformin plus bicalutamide was well tolerated, there was no improvement in rates of achieving undetectable PSA at 32 weeks. Metformin monotherapy induced modest PSA declines in 40% of patients after 8 weeks.

DNA-PK is deregulated in multiple tumor types, including prostate cancer, and is associated with poor outcomes. DNA-PK was previously nominated as a therapeutic target and DNA-PK inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical investigation. Although DNA-PK is well studied in DNA repair and transcriptional regulation, much remains to be understood about the way by which DNA-PK drives aggressive disease phenotypes.  Experimental design:   Here, unbiased proteomic and metabolomic approaches in clinically relevant tumor models uncovered a novel role of DNA-PK in metabolic regulation of cancer progression. DNA-PK regulation of metabolism was interrogated using pharmacologic and genetic perturbation using in vitro cell models, in vivo xenografts, and ex vivo in patient-derived explants (PDE).  Results:   Key findings reveal: (i) the first-in-field DNA-PK protein interactome; (ii) numerous DNA-PK novel partners involved in glycolysis; (iii) DNA-PK interacts with, phosphorylates (in vitro), and increases the enzymatic activity of glycolytic enzymes ALDOA and PKM2; (iv) DNA-PK drives synthesis of glucose-derived pyruvate and lactate; (v) DNA-PK regulates glycolysis in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo; and (vi) combination of DNA-PK inhibitor with glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose leads to additive anti-proliferative effects in aggressive disease.  Conclusions:   Findings herein unveil novel DNA-PK partners, substrates, and function in prostate cancer. DNA-PK impacts glycolysis through direct interaction with glycolytic enzymes and modulation of enzymatic activity. These events support energy production that may contribute to generation and/or maintenance of DNA-PK-mediated aggressive disease phenotypes.""","""['Emanuela Dylgjeri', 'Vishal Kothari', 'Ayesha A Shafi', 'Galina Semenova', 'Peter T Gallagher', 'Yi F Guan', 'Angel Pang', 'Jonathan F Goodwin', 'Swati Irani', 'Jennifer J McCann', 'Amy C Mandigo', 'Saswati Chand', 'Christopher M McNair', 'Irina Vasilevskaya', 'Matthew J Schiewer', 'Costas D Lallas', 'Peter A McCue', 'Leonard G Gomella', 'Erin L Seifert', 'Jason S Carroll', 'Lisa M Butler', 'Jeff Holst', 'William K Kelly', 'Karen E Knudsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Non-canonical role for DNA-PK in CRPC.', 'Pleiotropic Impact of DNA-PK in Cancer and Implications for Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Pyruvate kinase expression (PKM1 and PKM2) in cancer-associated fibroblasts drives stromal nutrient production and tumor growth.', 'Potential role for pyruvate kinase M2 in the regulation of murine cardiac glycolytic flux during in vivo chronic hypoxia.', 'Pyruvate kinase type M2: a key regulator within the tumour metabolome and a tool for metabolic profiling of tumours.', 'Pyruvate kinase type M2: a key regulator of the metabolic budget system in tumor cells.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.', 'Drug Discovery Targeting Post-Translational Modifications in Response to DNA Damages Induced by Space Radiation.', 'DNA-Dependent Protein Kinase Catalytic Subunit (DNA-PKcs): Beyond the DNA Double-Strand Break Repair.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Increased Resection at DSBs in G2-Phase Is a Unique Phenotype Associated with DNA-PKcs Defects That Is Not Shared by Other Factors of c-NHEJ.']"""

While cancer in general is considered a disease of the human genome, there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that changes to the healthy microbiota could play a vital role in cancer development, progression, and/or treatment outcome.  Methods:   Using a metatranscriptomic approach, we annotated the microbial reads obtained from total RNA sequencing of 106 prostate tissue samples from 94 PCa patients (discovery cohort). We investigated microbial dysbiosis associated with PCa by systematically comparing the microbiomes between benign and malignant tissue samples, between less vs. more-aggressive PCa, and between patients who had biochemical recurrence as opposed to those who did not. We further performed differential gene expression and cell type enrichment analysis to explore the host transcriptomic and cellular responses to selected microbial genera. A public dataset (GSE115414) of total RNA sequencing reads from 24 prostate tissue samples (8 benign and 16 malignant) served as the validation cohort.  Results:   We observed decreased species diversity and significant under-representation of Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus, as well as significant over-abundance of Shewanella in malignant as compared to benign prostate tissue samples in both the discovery (p < 0.01) and validation (p < 0.05) cohorts. In addition, we identified Microbacterium species (p < 0.01) to be significantly over-abundant in pathologically advanced T3 tumors compared to T2 in the discovery cohort. Malignant samples having high vs. low Shewanella counts were associated with downregulated Toll-like receptor signaling pathways and decreased enrichment of dendritic cells. Malignant samples having low vs. high V. parahaemolyticus counts were enriched for olfactory transduction and drug metabolism pathways. Finally, malignant samples were enriched for M1 and M2 macrophages as compared to benign tissue samples.  Conclusions:   The results from this exploratory study support the existence of an important biological link between the prostate microbiota and PCa development/progression. Our results highlight Shewanella, V. parahaemolyticus, and Microbacterium sp. as interesting candidates for further investigation of their association with PCa.""","""['Paul Vinu Salachan', 'Martin Rasmussen', 'Jacob Fredsøe', 'Benedicte Ulhøi', 'Michael Borre', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of human prostate microbiota from patients with prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Integrated analysis of the prostate cancer small-nucleolar transcriptome reveals SNORA55 as a driver of prostate cancer progression.', 'Microbiome and Prostate Cancer: A Novel Target for Prevention and Treatment.', 'The Microbiome and Prostate Cancer Risk.', 'Insights into the Human Microbiome and Its Connections with Prostate Cancer.', 'Awareness of intratumoral bacteria and their potential application in cancer treatment.', 'The human microbiome links to prostate cancer risk and treatment (Review).', 'Intratumor microbiota as a novel potential prognostic indicator in mesothelioma.', 'Microbiota of Urine, Glans and Prostate Biopsies in Patients with Prostate Cancer Reveals a Dysbiosis in the Genitourinary System.']"""

Methods:   We profiled the transcriptomic landscape of circRNAs in PC by total RNA sequencing of 31 adjacent-normal and 143 tumor samples from localized (radical prostatectomy (RP)) and metastatic PC patients (cohort 1, training). Diagnostic and prognostic potential was evaluated in cohort 1, and 39 top circRNA candidates were selected for validation in two additional PC cohorts (cohort 2, n = 111; RP cohort 3, n = 191) by NanoString-based expression analysis.

The circRNA candidates were further detected in extracellular vesicle (EV)-enriched plasma samples from PC patients and controls (cohort 4, n = 54).  Results:   Expression of circABCC4, circFAT3, circATRNL1, and circITGA7 was highly cancer-specific (area under the curve 0.71-0.86), while low circITGA7 expression was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with BCR in univariate analysis in two RP cohorts.

When metastasis is detected in the left supraclavicular node in patients with head and neck carcinoma, locating the primary cancer remains a difficult and time-consuming challenge despite the dramatic development of screening technologies and treatment methods.  Case presentation:   We report three cases of malignant infradiaphragmatic tumor diagnosed following an initial finding of left supraclavicular node metastasis after surgery for tongue squamous cell carcinoma (follow-up period, range 18-62 months). In these cases, adenocarcinoma was diagnosed based on left supraclavicular node biopsies, and a second primary tumor was found, in a 78-year-old Japanese woman with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, a 64-year-old Japanese man with a diagnosis of bladder carcinoma, and a 61-year-old Japanese man with a diagnosis of prostate carcinoma. In the cholangiocarcinoma case, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 and alpha-fetoprotein levels helped to diagnose cholangiocarcinoma. Palliative care only was given, with survival for 11 months after diagnosis of lymph node metastasis. In the bladder carcinoma case, pathological analysis of fine-needle aspiration biopsy specimen of the metastatic cervical lymph node showed atypical cells with slight squamous differentiation. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the bladder lesion did not identify a clear glandular or squamous component, and we could not make a definitive diagnosis of whether the lesion was poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or high-grade urothelial carcinoma. GATA3 staining aided in the diagnosis of urothelial bladder cancer with left supraclavicular node metastasis. He survived for 2 months after diagnosis of left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis. In the prostate carcinoma case, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was weak. Prostate-specific antigen levels and magnetic resonance imaging findings aided the diagnostic process. This patient underwent bilateral orchiectomy and adjuvant hormonal therapy and survived for 47 months after diagnosis of left supraclavicular node metastasis.

Between 25 and 39% of TNBCs are claudin-low, a poorly differentiated subtype enriched for mesenchymal, stem cell and mitogen-activated signaling pathways. We investigated the role of the cell-surface co-receptor NRP1 in the biology of claudin-low TNBC.  Methods:   The clinical prognostic value of NRP1 was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. GSVA analysis of METABRIC and Oslo2 transcriptomics datasets was used to correlate NRP1 expression with claudin-low gene signature scores. NRP1 siRNA knockdown was performed in MDA-MB-231, BT-549, SUM159 and Hs578T claudin-low cells and proliferation and viability measured by live cell imaging and DNA quantification. In SUM159 orthotopic xenograft models using NSG mice, NRP1 was suppressed by shRNA knockdown or systemic treatment with the NRP1-targeted monoclonal antibody Vesencumab. NRP1-mediated signaling pathways were interrogated by protein array and Western blotting.  Results:   High NRP1 expression was associated with shorter relapse- and metastasis-free survival specifically in ER-negative BrCa cohorts. NRP1 was over-expressed specifically in claudin-low clinical samples and cell lines, and NRP1 knockdown reduced proliferation of claudin-low cells and prolonged survival in a claudin-low orthotopic xenograft model.

Methods:   MRI scans from two institutions, were used for algorithm training, validation, testing. MRI-visible lesions were contoured by an experienced radiologist. All lesions were biopsied using MRI-TRUS-guidance. Lesions masks, histopathological results were used as ground truth labels to train UNet, AH-Net architectures for prostate cancer lesion detection, segmentation. Algorithm was trained to detect any prostate cancer ≥ ISUP1. Detection sensitivity, positive predictive values, mean number of false positive lesions per patient were used as performance metrics.

We hypothesize that the outcomes of retrospective comparative effectiveness research studies can be heavily influenced by biostatistical analytic choices, thereby leading to inconsistent conclusions. We selected a clinical scenario currently under investigation: survival in metastatic prostate, breast or lung cancer after systemic vs systemic + definitive local therapy. We ran >300 000 regression models (each representing a publishable study). Each model had various forms of analytic choices (to account for bias): propensity score matching, left truncation adjustment, landmark analysis and covariate combinations. There were 72 549 lung, 14 904 prostate and 13 857 breast cancer patients included. In the most basic analysis, which omitted propensity score matching, left truncation adjustment and landmark analysis, all of the HRs were <1 (generally, 0.60-0.95, favoring addition of local therapy), with all P-values <.001. Left truncation adjustment landmark analysis produced results with nonsignificant P-values. The combination of propensity score matching, left truncation adjustment, landmark analysis and covariate combinations generally produced P-values that were >.05 and/or HRs that were >1 (favoring systemic therapy alone). The use of more statistical methods to reduce the selection bias caused reported HR ranges to approach 1.0.

However, the optimal treatment strategy following progression through standard treatment with docetaxel, androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) and cabazitaxel, remains unclear. We aimed to describe treatment patterns in men with mCRPC following progression on standard treatments and determine whether subsequent treatment choice impacts overall survival.  Methods:   Clinicopathologic and treatment data were extracted from the electronic CRPC Australian Database (ePAD) for patients who had received docetaxel, ARSIs and cabazitaxel in any order. Data were analyzed to compare groups that did versus did not receive subsequent systemic therapy. Treatment sequences, median duration of treatment, and median overall survival (mOS) were reported for each treatment group.  Results:   Ninety-eight eligible patients were identified, with 51 receiving subsequent systemic therapy. Those who received further treatment were younger (68 vs. 71 years, p < .01) but did not have any other differences in clinicopathologic features compared to those who received no further treatment. Patients who received upfront docetaxel were more likely to proceed to subsequent treatment (p = .02). Subsequent systemic therapies varied, the most common being carboplatin-based regimens (n = 13, 25.5%) and many patients were rechallenged with ARSI (n = 10, 19.6%) or docetaxel (n = 6, 11.8%). There was no difference in mOS according to subsequent systemic therapy (p = .09).  Conclusion:   This retrospective multicenter analysis demonstrates the variation in treatment sequences used for mCRPC in the real-world setting.

Previously, we have designed an AON system to correct splicing of the androgen receptor (AR) pre-mRNA, thereby preventing the generation of the splice variant AR-V7 mRNA. AON-mediated knockdown of AR-V7 resulted in inhibition of androgen-independent cell proliferation. In this study, we evaluated the CPP-mediated delivery of this AON into castration-resistant prostate cancer cell line models 22Rv1, DuCaP (dura mater cancer of the prostate), and VCaP (vertebral cancer of the prostate).  Methods:   Nanoparticles (polyplexes) of AONs and CPPs were formed through rapid mixing. The impact of the peptide carrier, the formulation parameters, and cell incubation conditions on cellular uptake of fluorescently labeled AONs were assessed through flow cytometry. The cytotoxic activity of these formulations was measured using the CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay. The effectivity of CPP-mediated delivery of the splice-correcting AON-intronic splicing enhancer (ISE) targeting the ISE in the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-derived 22Rv1, DuCaP, and VCaP cells was determined by measuring levels of AR-V7 mRNA normalized to those of the human heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3 (HP1BP3). Western blot analysis was used to confirm AR-V7 downregulation at a protein level. The cellular distribution of fluorescently labeled AON delivered by a CPP or a transfection reagent was determined through confocal laser scanning microscopy.  Results:   The amphipathic and stearylated CPP PepFect 14 (PF14) showed higher uptake efficiency than arginine-rich CPPs. Through adjustment of formulation parameters, concentration and incubation time, an optimal balance between carrier-associated toxicity and delivery efficiency was found with a formulation consisting of an amino/phosphate ratio of 3, 0.35 μM AON concentration and 30 min incubation time of the cells with polyplexes. Cellular delivery of AON-ISE directed against AR pre-mRNA achieved significant downregulation of AR-V7 by 50%, 37%, and 59% for 22Rv1, DuCaP, and VCaP cells, respectively, and reduced androgen-independent cell proliferation of DuCaP and VCaP cells.

Molecular signatures of aggressive disease could help men overcome this major clinical challenge by reducing unnecessary treatment and allowing more appropriate treatment of aggressive disease.  Methods:   We performed a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of normal and malignant prostate tissues from 22 men who underwent surgery for prostate cancer. Prostate cancer samples included Grade Groups (3-5), with 8 patients experiencing recurrence and 14 without evidence of recurrence with a mean of 6.8 years of follow-up. To better understand the biological pathways underlying prostate cancer aggressiveness, we performed a systems biology analysis and gene enrichment analysis. Proteins that distinguished recurrent from nonrecurrent cancer were chosen for validation by immunohistochemical analysis on tissue microarrays containing samples from a larger cohort of patients with recurrent and nonrecurrent prostate cancer.  Results:   In all, 24,037 unique peptides (false discovery rate < 1%) corresponding to 3,313 distinct proteins were identified with absolute abundance ranges spanning seven orders of magnitude. Of these proteins, 115 showed significantly (p < 0.01) different levels in tissues from recurrent versus nonrecurrent cancers. Analysis of all differentially expressed proteins in recurrent and nonrecurrent cases identified several protein networks, most prominently one in which approximately 24% of the proteins in the network were regulated by the YY1 transcription factor (adjusted p < 0.001). Strong immunohistochemical staining levels of three differentially expressed proteins, POSTN, CALR, and CTSD, on a tissue microarray validated their association with shorter patient survival.

This study attempted to develop a clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) risk nomogram including Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score and other clinical indexes for initial prostate biopsy in light of the different prostate regions, and internal validation was further conducted.  Patients and methods:   A retrospective study was performed including 688 patients who underwent ultrasound-guided transperineal magnetic resonance imaging fusion prostate biopsy from December 2016 to July 2019. We constructed nomograms combining PI-RADS score and clinical variables (prostate-specific antigen [PSA], prostate volume (PV), age, free/total PSA, and PSA density) through univariate and multivariate logistic regression to identify patients eligible for biopsy. The performance of the predictive model was evaluated by bootstrap resampling. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was appointed to quantify the accuracy of the primary nomogram model for csPCa. Calibration curves were used to assess the agreement between the biopsy specimen and the predicted probability of the new nomogram. The χ2 test was also applied to evaluate the heterogeneity between fusion biopsy and systematic biopsy based on different PI-RADS scores and prostate regions.  Results:   A total of 320 of 688 included patients were diagnosed with csPCa. csPCa was defined as Gleason score ≥7. The ROC and concordance-index both presented good performance. The nomogram reached an AUC of 0.867 for predicting csPCa at the peripheral zone; meanwhile, AUC for transitional and apex zones were 0.889 and 0.757, respectively. Statistical significance was detected between fusion biopsy and systematic biopsy for PI-RADS score >3 lesions and lesions at the peripheral and transitional zones.  Conclusion:   We produced a novel nomogram predicting csPCa in patients with suspected imaging according to different locations. Our results indicated that PI-RADS score combined with other clinical parameters showed a robust predictive capacity for csPCa before prostate biopsy. The new nomogram, which incorporates prebiopsy data including PSA, PV, age, and PI-RADS score, can be helpful for clinical decision-making to avoid unnecessary biopsy.""","""['Zhien Zhou', 'Zhen Liang', 'Yuzhi Zuo', 'Yi Zhou', 'Weigang Yan', 'Xingcheng Wu', 'Zhigang Ji', 'Hanzhong Li', 'Mengyao Hu', 'Lin Ma']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-naïve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009≤\u20093?', 'The potential of a nomogram combined PI-RADS v2.1 and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to reduce unnecessary biopsies in prostate cancer diagnostics.', 'A 4K score/MRI-based nomogram for predicting prostate cancer, clinically significant prostate cancer, and unfavorable prostate cancer.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Patients With ""Gray Zone"" PSA Levels: Application of Prostate MRI and MRS in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.', 'Prevalence and grade of malignancy differences with respect to the area of involvement in multiparametric resonance imaging of the prostate in the diagnosis of prostate cancer using the PI-RADS version 2 classification.', 'Pilot study for generating and assessing nomograms and decision curves analysis to predict clinically significant prostate cancer using only spatially registered multi-parametric MRI.']"""

Decreased ITGA2 promoter methylation is implicated as a driver of increased gene expression in aggressive prostate and pancreatic tumours, however the contribution of altered methylation to ITGA2 expression changes in breast tumours has not been examined.  Methods:   ITGA2 gene methylation and gene expression was examined in publicly available breast cancer datasets, and ITGA2 promoter methylation was mapped by targeted bisulphite sequencing analysis in breast tumour cell lines. The expression of a putative regulatory long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) was examined by qPCR and its' functionality was investigated using gene knockdown (antisense oligonucleotides) and over expression in breast cancer cell lines.  Results:   In breast tumours and breast cancer cell lines the ITGA2 promoter is largely unmethylated, with gene expression variable in tumour subtypes, irrespective of promoter methylation. A novel lncRNA (AC025180.1;ENSG00000249899), named herein I2ALR, was identified at the ITGA2 gene locus, and was variably expressed in breast tumours and breast cancer cell subtypes. I2LAR knockdown resulted in upregulation of ITGA2 gene expression, whilst over-expression of I2ALR resulted in downregulation of ITGA2 mRNA. Further, examination of two downstream targets of ITGA2 associated with breast tumor stemness and metastasis (CCND1 and ACLY), revealed concomitant gene expression changes in response to I2ALR modulation.

We previously showed that estrogenic effects contribute to CRPC progression and are primarily caused by the increased endogenous estradiol produced via highly expressed aromatase. However, the mechanism of aromatase upregulation and its role in CRPC are poorly described. In this study, we report that HeyL is aberrantly upregulated in CRPC tissues, and its expression is positively correlated with aromatase levels. HeyL overexpression increased endogenous estradiol levels and estrogen receptor-α (ERα) transcriptional activity by upregulating CYP19A1 expression, which encodes aromatase, enhancing prostate cancer stem cell (PCSC) properties in PC3 cells. Mechanistically, HeyL bound to the CYP19A1 promoter and activated its transcription. HeyL overexpression significantly promoted bicalutamide resistance in LNCaP cells, which was reversed by the aromatase inhibitor letrozole. In PC3 cells, the HeyL-aromatase axis promoted the PCSC phenotype by upregulating autophagy-related genes, while the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) suppressed the aromatase-induced PCSC phenotype. The activated HeyL-aromatase axis promoted PCSC autophagy via ERα-mediated estrogenic effects. Taken together, our results indicated that the HeyL-aromatase axis could increase endogenous estradiol levels and activate ERα to suppress PCSC apoptosis by promoting autophagy, which enhances the understanding of how endogenous estrogenic effects influence CRPC development.""","""['Qimei Lin', 'Jiasong Cao', 'Xiaoling Du', 'Kuo Yang', 'Yongmei Shen', 'Weishu Wang', 'Helmut Klocker', 'Jiandang Shi', 'Ju Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Aromatase-induced endogenous estrogen promotes tumour metastasis through estrogen receptor-α/matrix metalloproteinase 12 axis activation in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'CYP1B1-catalyzed 4-OHE2 promotes the castration resistance of prostate cancer stem cells by estrogen receptor α-mediated IL6 activation.', 'NPRL2 enhances autophagy and the resistance to Everolimus in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Hypoxia induced cancer stem cell enrichment promotes resistance to androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen metabolites and breast cancer.', 'Prostate cancer induced bone pain: pathobiology, current treatments and pain responses from recent clinical trials.']"""

Despite evidence suggesting that surgical experience correlates with perioperative and oncologic outcomes of robot-assisted RC (RARC), validated tools to assess its quality objectively are lacking. We aimed to evaluate the impact of RC-Pentafecta (absence of early major complications, absence of urinary diversion related sequelae at ≤12 months, absence of soft tissue surgical margins, ≥16 lymph nodes at final pathology and absence of clinical recurrence at ≤12 months) on oncological outcomes and the role of surgical experience on its achievement.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 366 patients undergoing RARC with intracorporeal urinary diversion in a single tertiary centre with a minimum of 1 year follow-up. Surgeries were performed using the DaVinci Xi system according to a previously described technique. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to investigate 5-years overall survival and cancer specific mortality-free survival (CSS) according to RC-Pentafecta achievement. Multivariable Cox's regressions were performed to evaluate the impact of RC-Pentafecta on overall mortality. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to explore the effect of surgical experience on RC-pentafecta achievement. Locally weighted scatterplot smoother function was used to graphically explore this relationship.  Results:   Patients achieving RC-Pentafecta showed higher 5-year overall survival (71.8% vs. 59.6%, P < 0.001) and CSS (84% vs. 71%, P < 0.001) when compared with patients not achieving it. At multivariable Cox's regression, RC-Pentafecta achievement (HR 0.57, P = 0.03), positive surgical margins (HR 2.48, P = 0.002), pN+ (HR 2.23, P = 0.002), pT≥3 (HR 1.71, P = 0.04) and current smoking status (HR 2.4, P = 0.006) were significant predictors of overall mortality. At multivariable logistic regression surgical experience (OR 1.2, P < 0.001), age (OR 0.93, P = 0.04), previous prostate surgery (OR 0.7, P = 0.02) and pT≥3 (OR 0.8, P = 0.03) were independent predictors of RC-Pentafecta achievement. A linear relationship between surgical experience and RC-Pentafecta achievement, without reaching a plateau, was observed.  Conclusions:   RC-Pentafecta is a valuable tool to assess surgical quality of RARC and the experience of the center where the surgery is performed and may be used to identify ""referral"" centers for treatment of high-risk bladder cancer.""","""['Pietro Piazza', 'Carlo Andrea Bravi', 'Stefano Puliatti', 'Giovanni Enrico Cacciamani', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Marco Amato', ""Paolo Dell'Oglio"", 'Elio Mazzone', 'Giuseppe Rosiello', 'Rui Farinha', 'Luca Sarchi', 'Simone Scarcella', 'Pawel Wisz', 'Riccardo Schiavina', 'Dries Develtere', 'Pieter De Backer', 'Ruben De Groote', ""Frederiek D'Hondt"", 'Alexandre Mottrie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['External validation of Pentafecta in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical cystectomy: results from a high-volume center.', 'Multicenter external validation of the radical cystectomy pentafecta in a European cohort of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion for bladder cancer.', 'Radical cystectomy pentafecta: a proposal for standardisation of outcomes reporting following robot-assisted radical cystectomy.', 'Systematic review and cumulative analysis of oncologic and functional outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy.', 'Utility of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'External validation of Pentafecta in patients undergoing laparoscopic radical cystectomy: results from a high-volume center.']"""

The STHLM3-MRI study (NCT03377881) found that the Stockholm3 test with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and combined targeted and systematic biopsies maintained the sensitivity for clinically significant cancers, and reduced the number of benign biopsies and clinically insignificant cancers.  Objective:   To assess the cost-effectiveness of MRI-based screening for prostate cancer using either Stockholm3 as a reflex test or PSA alone.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cost-utility analysis was performed from a lifetime societal perspective using a microsimulation model for men aged 55-69 yr in Sweden. Test characteristics were estimated from the STHLM3-MRI study.  Intervention:   No screening and three quadrennial screening strategies, including either PSA ≥3 ng/ml or Stockholm3 with reflex test thresholds of PSA ≥1.5 or 2 ng/ml as criteria for referral to MRI, were performed, and those who were MRI positive had combined targeted and systematic biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Predictions included the number of tests, cancer incidence and mortality, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years. Uncertainties in key parameters were assessed using sensitivity analyses.  Results and limitations:   Compared with no screening, the screening strategies were predicted to reduce prostate cancer deaths by 7-9% across a lifetime. The use of Stockholm3 with PSA ≥2 ng/ml resulted in a 60% reduction in MRI compared with screening using PSA. This Stockholm3 strategy was cost-effective with a probability of 70% at a cost-effectiveness threshold of €47 218 (500 000 Swedish Kronor). As a potential limitation, the economic perspective was specific to Sweden.  Conclusions:   Screening with the Stockholm3 test at a reflex threshold of PSA ≥2 ng/ml and MRI was predicted to be cost-effective in Sweden.  Patient summary:   The Stockholm3 test with image-based screening may reduce screening-related harms and costs, while maintaining the health benefits from early detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Shuang Hao', 'Emelie Heintz', 'Ellinor Östensson', 'Andrea Discacciati', 'Fredrik Jäderling', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Martin Eklund', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Mark S Clements']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Corrigendum to ""Cost-Effectiveness of the Stockholm3 Test and Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Prostate Cancer Screening: A Microsimulation Study"" Eur Urol 2022.', 'Improved Harm/Benefit Ratio and Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening Using New Technologies.', 'Prostate cancer screening using a combination of risk-prediction, MRI, and targeted prostate biopsies (STHLM3-MRI): a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.', 'The cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening using the Stockholm3 test.', 'Prostate Cancer Diagnostics Using a Combination of the Stockholm3 Blood Test and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Prostate cancer screening-stepping forward with MRI.', 'Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Screening Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Standard Biopsy Based on the STHLM3-MRI Study.']"""

PI-RADSv2 guidelines recommend that important clinical information including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, examination findings, and biopsy information should be included in mpMRI requests. PIRADS score and PSA density (PSAD) are both independent predictors for the presence of a clinically significant prostate cancer.  Aims:   This study aims to evaluate the quality of mpMRI requests and reports at our institution in accordance with these parameters.  Methods:   All prostate mpMRIs performed by radiology services in Galway University Hospital between 1st September 2019 and 1st March 2020 were reviewed. Exclusion criteria were applied. Requests and reports were analysed for the presence of the following parameters: PSA-results, examination findings, biopsy information, PI-RADS score, prostate volume, and PSAD.  Results:   A total of 586 mpMRIs were performed, and of these, 546 were included. PSA value was provided in 497 (91%) of requests, exam findings in 355 (65%), and biopsy information in 452 (82%). PIRADS score was included in 224 (41%) of reports, prostate volume in 178 (32.6%), and PSAD in 106 (19%).  Conclusions:   Great variation in the quality of information contained in both requests and reports for prostate mpMRIs exists within our service.

Although cancer-related CDCA8 hyperactivation has been widely observed, its molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we report that CDCA8 overexpression maintains tumorigenicity and is associated with poor clinical outcome in patients with prostate cancer (PCa). Notably, enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is identified to be responsible for CDCA8 activation in PCa. Genome-wide assays revealed that EZH2-induced H3K27 trimethylation represses let-7b expression and thus protects the let-7b-targeting CDCA8 transcripts. More importantly, EZH2 facilitates the self-activation of E2F1 by recruiting E2F1 to its own promoter region in a methylation-independent manner. The high level of E2F1 further promotes transcription of CDCA8 along with the other CPC subunits. Taken together, our study suggests that EZH2-mediated cell cycle regulation in PCa relies on both its methyltransferase and non-methyltransferase activities.""","""['Yang Yi#', 'Yanqiang Li#', 'Chao Li#', 'Longxiang Wu', 'Dongyu Zhao', 'Fuxi Li', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Rui Wang', 'Long Wang', 'Xuesen Dong', 'Wei Zhao', 'Kaifu Chen', 'Qi Cao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Unveiling the non-canonical functions of EZH2 in prostate cancer.', 'NCAPD3 promotes prostate cancer progression by up-regulating EZH2 and MALAT1 through STAT3 and E2F1.', 'BRCA1 and EZH2 cooperate in regulation of prostate cancer stem cell phenotype.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Functional and therapeutic significance of EZH2 in urological cancers.', 'The m6A methylation landscape, molecular characterization and clinical relevance in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Unveiling the non-canonical functions of EZH2 in prostate cancer.', 'Integrative Bioinformatics Analysis Reveals CHEK1 and UBE2C as Luminal A Breast Cancer Subtype Biomarkers.']"""

While a few legacy PFASs have been voluntarily phased out, over 5000 PFASs have been produced as replacements for their predecessors. The potential endocrine disrupting hazards of most emerging PFASs have not been comprehensively investigated. In silico molecular docking to the human androgen receptor (hAR) combined with machine learning techniques were previously applied to 5206 PFASs and predicted 23 PFASs bind the hAR. Herein, the in silico results were validated in vitro for the five candidate AR ligands that were commercially available. Three manufactured PFASs namely (9-(nonafluorobutyl)- 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1 H,5 H,11 H-pyrano[2,3-f]pyrido[3,2,1-ij]quinolin-11-one (NON), 2-(heptafluoropropyl)- 3-phenylquinoxaline (HEP), and 2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5-nonafluoro-N-(4-nitrophenyl)pentanamide (NNN) elicited significant antiandrogenic effects at relatively low concentrations. We further investigated the mechanism of AR inhibition and found that all three PFASs inhibited AR transactivation induced by testosterone through a competitive binding mechanism. We then examined the antiandrogenic effects of these PFASs on AR expression and its responsive genes. Consistently, these PFASs significantly decreased the expression of PSA and FKBP5 and increased the expression of AR, similar to the effects elicited by a known competitive AR inhibitor, hydroxyflutamide. This suggests they are competitive antagonists of AR activity and western blot analysis revealed these PFASs decreased intracellular AR protein in androgen sensitive human prostate cancer cells. Hence, the findings presented here corroborate our published in silico approach and indicate these emerging PFASs may adversely affect the human endocrine system.""","""['Phum Tachachartvanich', 'Ettayapuram Ramaprasad Azhagiya Singam', 'Kathleen A Durkin', 'J David Furlow', 'Martyn T Smith', 'Michele A La Merrill']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Hazard Mater""","""['Structure-based discovery of the endocrine disrupting effects of hydraulic fracturing chemicals as novel androgen receptor antagonists.', 'Prediction of the endocrine-disrupting ability of 49 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances: In silico and epidemiological evidence.', 'Structure-based virtual screening of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) as endocrine disruptors of androgen receptor activity using molecular docking and machine learning.', 'Endocrine Disruptor Potential of Short- and Long-Chain Perfluoroalkyl Substances (PFASs)-A Synthesis of Current Knowledge with Proposal of Molecular Mechanism.', 'An Overview of Next-Generation Androgen Receptor-Targeted Therapeutics in Development for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'ChemMaps.com v2.0: exploring the environmental chemical universe.', 'In Utero Exposure to a Mixture of the Perfluoroalkyl-Isopropyl Pesticide Pyrifluquinazon With Dibutyl Phthalate Cumulatively Disrupts Male Rat Reproductive Development via Different Mechanisms of Action.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective pilot study included 43 prostate cancer (PCa) patients referred to our radiation oncologist department, from the urology department, for radiation therapy. 18F-PSMA-PET/CT was ordered by the radiation oncologists mainly due to the lack of resent image staging. The patients were divided into three different groups according to their initially planned treatments: radical radiation therapy (RT) (newly diagnosed PCa patients), salvage RT (patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy), or oligometastatic RT (oligometastatic PCa patients with good response after systemic treatment).  Results:   Following PSMA-PET/CT, the initially planned RT was changed for 60.5% of the patients due to new findings (metastases and/or recurrent disease). The final treatment choice was effected by PSMA-PET/CT outcome in 60.5% (26/43) of the patients, and in 50% (16/32) of patients, the radiation treatment plan changed following PSMA-PET/CT.

Second, when the large-scale data under analysis include binary predictors with near-zero variance (e.g., only 0.6% of patients in our SEER prostate cancer data had tumors regional to the lymph nodes), existing methods suffer from numerical instability due to ill-conditioned second-order information. The estimation accuracy deteriorates further with multiple competing risks. To address these issues, we propose a proximal Newton algorithm with a shared-memory parallelization scheme and tests of significance and nonproportionality for the time-varying effects. A simulation study shows that our scalable approach reduces the time and memory costs by orders of magnitude and enjoys improved estimation accuracy compared with alternative approaches. Applications to the SEER cancer data demonstrate the real-world performance of the proximal Newton algorithm.""","""['Wenbo Wu', 'Jeremy M G Taylor', 'Andrew F Brouwer', 'Lingfeng Luo', 'Jian Kang', 'Hui Jiang', 'Kevin He']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Lifetime Data Anal""","""['Improving five-year survival prediction via multitask learning across HPV-related cancers.', 'On the analysis of discrete time competing risks data.', 'Descriptive characteristics of prostate cancer in patients with a history of primary male breast cancer - a SEER analysis.', 'Spatially varying effects of predictors for the survival prediction of nonmetastatic colorectal Cancer.', 'Cancers of the prostate, penis, and testicles: epidemiology, prevention, and treatment.']"""

We aimed to evaluate the correlation between RhoA and YAP expression in the stroma cells obtained from prostate and ovarian cancer tissues.  Methods:   We analyzed two microarray datasets obtained from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO). The sample type of two datasets was RNA, which is displaying the transcriptome profiling. The tumor stroma of patients with invasive prostate cancer and high-grade serous ovarian cancer were obtained from datasets Independent t-test was used to analyze the differentially expressed YAP between normal stroma and cancer stroma. In addition, Pearson's correlation was run to analyze the correlation between YAP and RhoA expressions.  Results:   In comparison with normal stroma tissues, YAP1 was overexpressed in prostate and ovarian cancer stroma tissues (prostate cancer stroma, p <0.05; ovarian cancer stroma, p < 0.001). Furthermore, a positive correlation was detected between YAP and RhoA expressions in stroma of both tumor types. This correlation was positively strong in prostate cancer stroma (R=0.607) and positively weak in ovarian cancer stroma (R=0.248).  Conclusion:   We found that YAP was overexpressed in prostate and ovarian cancer stroma. Furthermore, the correlation between RhoA and YAP expression suggested that RhoA-YAP signals could physiologically be involved in tumor stroma. Thus, targeting RhoA-YAP may be an intriguing avenue for cancer therapeutics in neoplastic epithelial cells as well as tumor stroma.""","""['Myung-Jin Lee', 'Dokyeong Kim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['LncRNA PCGEM1 Induces Ovarian Carcinoma Tumorigenesis and Progression Through RhoA Pathway.', 'Cytoskeletal alteration modulates cancer cell invasion through RhoA-YAP signaling in stromal fibroblasts.', 'Systematic Identification of Druggable Epithelial-Stromal Crosstalk Signaling Networks in Ovarian Cancer.', 'Cellular Constituents of the Prostate Stroma: Key Contributors to Prostate Cancer Progression and Therapy Resistance.', 'Regulation of heterogeneous cancer-associated fibroblasts: the molecular pathology of activated signaling pathways.']"""

Eighty-eight BPH patients were recruited based on clinical and ultrasound findings. MMP-9 and its inhibitor (TIMP-1), interleukin-23 and pentraxin-3 were estimated in all the subjects.

TIMP-1 was significantly correlated with MMP-9 (p = 0.006) and prostate size (p = 0.016). Pentraxin-3 was positively correlated with PSQI score (p = 0.047). Multivariate analysis shows that interleukin -23 (p = 0.006) predicts prostate enlargement in BPH patients.

An academic-community partnership redesigned its community-based screening program to ensure access to services for African American men, incorporating a session with a trained clinical educator in community settings, designed to increase knowledge and promote informed decision-making regarding PSA testing. This study evaluated effects of the intervention on decision-making outcomes.  Methods:   To evaluate program efficacy, 88 men completed pre- and post-test surveys assessing outcomes of interest.  Results:   Participants' knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, anxiety levels, and self-efficacy all improved from pre- to post-test at a statistically significant level. Most notably participants' awareness that PCa is often not life-threatening, and watchful waiting is a reasonable treatment option increased after the encounter. More than half of the study sample felt they had received enough knowledge to make an informed decision about whether the PSA test was right for them.

The NEAR trial is a single-arm, phase II investigation of neoadjuvant apalutamide monotherapy and radical prostatectomy (RP) in the treatment of D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (NCT03124433).  Materials and methods:   Patients with histologically-proven, D'Amico intermediate- to high-risk prostate adenocarcinoma received apalutamide 240 mg once-daily for 12 weeks followed by RP + /-lymphadenectomy. Primary outcome was pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Secondary outcomes included rate of biochemical response (defined by PSA < 0.03 ng/mL at week 24 from starting apalutamide without subsequent PSA relapse), treatment-related adverse events, and RP complication rates. Correlative biomarker analyses were performed to examine for molecular predictors of treatment responses.  Results:   From 2017 to 2019, 30 patients were recruited, of which 20 and 10 were high and intermediate risk, respectively; 25 completed treatment as per-protocol. We did not observe any pCR on trial; median reduction of cancer burden was 41.7% (IQR: 33.3%-60.0%). 18 out of 25 patients were classified as having a biochemical response (4 did not achieve PSA of <0.03 ng/mL at week 24 and 3 developed PSA relapse subsequently).

Herein we synthesized single-atom platinum-anchored Zn0.5Cd0.5S nanostructures to construct an innovative photoelectrochemical (PEC) immunosensor for photocurrent determination of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Improvement of the photocurrent on the sensing interface derived from the ion-exchange reaction between cupric oxide nanoparticle (CuO NP)-labeled secondary antibody and single-atom platinum-anchored Zn0.5Cd0.5S. The experimental results showed that the doping of zinc ions and atomically dispersed platinum into CdS could significantly enhance the photocurrent, which further improved the sensitivity of immunoassay. Specifically, upon sensing the target PSA, a CuO-labeled detection antibody was introduced by sandwich immunoreaction and numerous copper ions (Cu2+) were released from CuO by acid to participate in the ion-exchange reaction. Thereafter, the ion-exchange reaction between Cu2+ ions and single-atom platinum-anchored Zn0.5Cd0.5S resulted in the quenching of the photocurrent from single-atom platinum-anchored Zn0.5Cd0.5S owing to weak photoactive material CuxS formation. Under optimized conditions, single-atom platinum-anchored Zn0.5Cd0.5S-based photoelectrochemical immunoassay gave good PEC signals toward PSA from 1.0 to 10000 pg/mL with a limit of detection of 0.22 pg/mL. Additionally, good repeatability, intermediate precision, strong anti-interference and high accuracy (relative to commercialized ELISA kit) for the measurement of human serum specimens were acquired.

Results:   In the EU, we predict 1 269 200 cancer deaths in 2022; corresponding age-standardized rates (world) fall 6% to 126.9 deaths/100 000 in men and 4% to 80.2/100 000 women since 2017. Male lung cancer is expected to fall 10% reaching 30.9/100 000. The rise in female lung cancer mortality slowed (+2% to 13.8/100 000). We estimated 369 000 (23%) avoided deaths in 2022 alone and a total of 5 394 000 (12%) deaths since the peak rate in 1988. Stomach, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers showed substantial declines, between 5% and 16% over the past 5 years.

The fall in uterine cancers slowed down (-4%) to 4.7/100 000. Bladder cancer fell 9% in men, but was stable in women. Leukaemias fell more than 10%. Ovarian cancer mortality declined over the past decade in all considered countries.

The activated CRISPR-Cas system will then mediate trans-ssDNA cleavage of neighboring linker DNA, which unlocks the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) signal probes and gives a distance-dependent colorimetric readout. This assay could detect PSA in aqueous buffer sensitively and selectively with a limit of detection (LOD) down to 0.030 ng mL-1. Importantly, this assay was successfully applied for discriminating four blood samples from prostate cancer patients among thirteen blood samples from normal individuals/cancer patients accurately. This work will open an avenue for the development of SDA-CRISPR-AuNPs hybrid sensing systems, offering great potential for the development of non-invasive point-of-care diagnostic tools for prostate cancer.""","""['Wanhe Wang', 'Jianhua Liu', 'Li-An Wu', 'Chung-Nga Ko', 'Xueliang Wang', 'Chuankai Lin', 'Jingqi Liu', 'Liansheng Ling', 'Jing Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['A novel colorimetric aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of aflatoxin M1 based on the combination of CRISPR-Cas12a, rolling circle amplification and catalytic activity of gold nanoparticles.', 'Nano-immunosorbent assay based on Cas12a/crRNA for ultra-sensitive protein detection.', 'Reverse Transcription Recombinase Polymerase Amplification Coupled with CRISPR-Cas12a for Facile and Highly Sensitive Colorimetric SARS-CoV-2 Detection.', 'M-CDC: Magnetic pull-down-assisted colorimetric method based on the CRISPR/Cas12a system.', 'CRISPR/Cas-powered nanobiosensors for diagnostics.', 'Aptamer-based CRISPR-Cas powered diagnostics of diverse biomarkers and small molecule targets.', 'Gold Nanoparticles as a Biosensor for Cancer Biomarker Determination.', 'Recent Advances in CRISPR/Cas-Based Biosensors for Protein Detection.', 'Types and Applications of Nicking Enzyme-Combined Isothermal Amplification.']"""

However, as it includes exposure of a large volume of healthy tissue to unwanted doses, there is a strong concern about the complications of the treatment, especially for the children. To estimate the risk of second cancers and other unwanted effects, out-of-field dose assessment is necessary. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare out-of-field doses in pediatric CSI treatment using conventional and advanced photon radiotherapy (RT) and advanced proton therapy. To our knowledge, it is the first such comparison based on in-phantom measurements. Additionally, for out-of-field doses during photon RT in this and other studies, comparisons were made using analytical modeling.  Methods:   In order to describe the out-of-field doses absorbed in a pediatric patient during actual clinical treatment, an anthropomorphic phantom, which mimics the 10-year-old child, was used. Photon 3D-conformal RT (3D-CRT) and two advanced, highly conformal techniques: photon volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and active pencil beam scanning (PBS) proton RT were used for CSI treatment. Radiophotoluminescent and poly-allyl-diglycol-carbonate nuclear track detectors were used for photon and neutron dosimetry in the phantom, respectively. Out-of-field doses from neutrons were expressed in terms of dose equivalent. A two-Gaussian model was implemented for out-of-field doses during photon RT.  Results:   The mean VMAT photon doses per target dose to all organs in this study were under 50% of the target dose (i.e., <500 mGy/Gy), while the mean 3D-CRT photon dose to oesophagus, gall bladder, and thyroid, exceeded that value. However, for 3D-CRT, better sparing was achieved for eyes and lungs. The mean PBS photon doses for all organs were up to three orders of magnitude lower compared to VMAT and 3D-CRT and exceeded 10 mGy/Gy only for the oesophagus, intestine, and lungs. The mean neutron dose equivalent during PBS for eight organs of interest (thyroid, breasts, lungs, liver, stomach, gall bladder, bladder, prostate) ranged from 1.2 mSv/Gy for bladder to 23.1 mSv/Gy for breasts. Comparison of out-of-field doses in this and other phantom studies found in the literature showed that a simple and fast two-Gaussian model for out-of-field doses as a function of distance from the field edge can be applied in a CSI using photon RT techniques.  Conclusions:   PBS is the most promising technique for out-of-field dose reduction in comparison to photon techniques. Among photon techniques, VMAT is a preferred choice for most of out-of-field organs and especially for the thyroid, while doses for eyes, breasts, and lungs are lower for 3D-CRT. For organs outside the field edge, a simple analytical model can be helpful for clinicians involved in treatment planning using photon RT but also for retrospective data analysis for cancer risk estimates and epidemiology in general.""","""['Marija Majer', 'Iva Ambrožová', 'Marie Davídková', 'Marijke De Saint-Hubert', 'Mladen Kasabašić', 'Željka Knežević', 'Renata Kopeć', 'Dawid Krzempek', 'Katarzyna Krzempek', 'Saveta Miljanić', 'Natalia Mojżeszek', 'Ivan Veršić', 'Liliana Stolarczyk', 'Roger M Harrison', 'Paweł Olko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Out-of-field doses from pediatric craniospinal irradiations using 3D-CRT, IMRT, helical tomotherapy and electron-based therapy.', 'Treatment planning with protons for pediatric retinoblastoma, medulloblastoma, and pelvic sarcoma: how do protons compare with other conformal techniques?', 'Pediatric craniospinal irradiation with a short partial-arc VMAT technique for medulloblastoma tumors in dosimetric comparison.', 'A review of dosimetric and toxicity modeling of proton versus photon craniospinal irradiation for pediatrics medulloblastoma.', 'High dose craniospinal irradiation as independent risk factor of permanent alopecia in childhood medulloblastoma survivors: cohort study and literature review.', 'Comparison of 3DCRT and IMRT out-of-field doses in pediatric patients using Monte Carlo simulations with treatment planning system calculations and measurements.', 'Out-of-Field Doses Produced by a Proton Scanning Beam Inside Pediatric Anthropomorphic Phantoms and Their Comparison With Different Photon Modalities.', 'Neutron Radiation Dose Measurements in a Scanning Proton Therapy Room: Can Parents Remain Near Their Children During Treatment?', 'Experimental Validation of an Analytical Program and a Monte Carlo Simulation for the Computation of the Far Out-of-Field Dose in External Beam Photon Therapy Applied to Pediatric Patients.', 'Determining Out-of-Field Doses and Second Cancer Risk From Proton Therapy in Young Patients-An Overview.']"""

Transcription factor 6 α (ATF6α), an effector of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that modulates the cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, has been linked to tumor development, metastasis, and relapse. However, the role of ATF6α in CRPC remains unclear.  Methods:   The effect of ATF6α on the CRPC-like phenotype in PCa cells was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carb-Oxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (MTS), 5-Bromo-2-deoxyUridine (BrdU) incorporation analysis, and cell death assay. Mechanistically, bioinformatic analysis was utilized to evaluate the potential of PLA2G4A as the target of ATF6α. Moreover, Western blot analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, chromatin immunoprecipitation, arachidonic acid (AA), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assays were performed to identify the regulatory effect of ATF6α on PLA2G4A.  Results:   In this study, we found that the increase of ATF6α expression in response to androgen deprivation generates PCa cells with a CRPC-like phenotype. PCa cells with high levels of ATF6α expression are resistant to ferroptosis, and genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ATF6α could, therefore, promote the ferroptotic death of tumor cells and delay PCa progression. Molecular analyses linked ATF6α regulation of ferroptosis to the PLA2G4A-mediated release of AA and the resulting increase in PGE2 production, the latter of which acts as an antiferroptotic factor.  Conclusions:   This study defines ATF6α as a novel antiferroptotic regulator that exacerbates PCa progression. In addition, our data establish ATF6α-PLA2G4A signaling as an important pathological pathway in PCa, and targeting this pathway may be a novel treatment strategy.""","""['Ru Zhao', 'Ye Lv', 'Tingting Feng', 'Ruojia Zhang', 'Luna Ge', 'Jihong Pan', 'Bo Han', 'Guanhua Song', 'Lin Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The functional implication of ATF6α in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'MYBL2 disrupts the Hippo-YAP pathway and confers castration resistance and metastatic potential in prostate cancer.', 'Estrogen induces androgen-repressed SOX4 expression to promote progression of prostate cancer cells.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Untargeted lipidomic analysis and network pharmacology for parthenolide treated papillary thyroid carcinoma cells.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'Autophagy, molecular chaperones, and unfolded protein response as promoters of tumor recurrence.', 'Induction mechanism of ferroptosis: A novel therapeutic target in lung disease.', 'Progression of prostate cancer reprograms MYC-mediated lipid metabolism via lysine methyltransferase 2A.']"""

Propensity score (PS) matching was performed and 71 patients were selected from a cohort of 875 who underwent RARP with the Xi robot in the same period. We divided the total expense per surgery into the cost of disposable materials, robotic instruments (initial purchasing cost divided by the number of ""lives""), and operative room costs. Only variable costs are included in this study, as fixed costs do not vary between procedures and are the same for both cohorts. Fixed costs include anesthesia, pathology, surgeon, and hospitalization fees. The median total cost for SP-RARP was $5586 ($5360-$5982) USD and $4875 ($4661-$5093) USD with the XI for a median cost difference of $707 ($584-$832) (P < 0.001).

Non-disposable instruments cost per case (fixed cost) was $1610 and $1270 USD for the SP and Xi, respectively. The cost of radical prostatectomy in the SP cohort is higher than the Xi cohort. The greater price was primarily due to the increased cost of instruments and disposable materials.

Patients were classified into four clusters, which were associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Moreover, 200 prognostic-related genes were selected using the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis and univariable Cox regression. The prognostic CCRG risk score was constructed using random forest survival and multivariate regression Cox methods, and their efficiency was validated in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and GSE70770. We identified nine survival-related genes: CCNL2, CDCA5, KAT2A, CHTF18, SPC24, EME2, CDK5RAP3, CDC20, and PTTG1. Based on the median risk score, the patients were divided into two groups. Then the functional enrichment analyses, mutational profiles, immune components, estimated half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50), and candidate drugs were screened of these two groups. In addition, the characteristics of nine hub CCRGs were explored in Oncomine, cBioPortal, and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) datasets. Finally, the expression profiles of these hub CCRGs were validated in RWPE-1 and three PRAD cell lines (PC-3, C4-2, and DU-145).

Two techniques of rotational IMRT are commonly used in this indication: Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and helical tomotherapy (HT). To the best of our knowledge, no study has compared their related costs and clinical effectiveness and/or toxicity in prostate cancer. We aimed to assess differences in costs and toxicity between VMAT and HT in patients with high-risk prostate cancer with pelvic irradiation.  Material and methods:   We used data from the ""RCMI pelvis"" prospective multicenter study (NCT01325961) including 155 patients. We used a micro-costing methodology to identify cost differences between VMAT and HT. To assess the effects of the two techniques on total actual costs per patient and on toxicity we used stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting.  Results:   The mean total cost for HT, €2019 3,069 (95% CI, 2,885-3,285) was significantly higher than the mean cost for VMAT €2019 2,544 (95% CI, 2,443-2,651) (p <.0001). The mean ± SD labor and accelerator cost for HT was €2880 (± 583) and €1978 (± 475) for VMAT, with 81 and 76% for accelerator, respectively. Acute GI and GU toxicity were more frequent in VMAT than in HT (p = .021 and p = .042, respectively). Late toxicity no longer differed between the two groups up to 24 months after completion of treatment.  Conclusion:   Use of VMAT was associated with lower costs for IMRT planning and treatment than HT.

After initial treatment with androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSi), reactivation of AR signaling leads to resistance. Alternative splicing of AR mRNA yields the AR-V7 splice variant, which is currently an undruggable mechanism of ARSi resistance: AR-V7 lacks a ligand binding domain, where hormones and anti-androgen antagonists act, but still activates AR signaling. We reveal PKCβ as a druggable regulator of transcription and splicing at the AR genomic locus. We identify a clinical PKCβ inhibitor in combination with an FDA-approved anti-androgen as an approach for repressing AR genomic locus expression, including expression of AR-V7, while antagonizing full-length AR. PKCβ inhibition reduces total AR gene expression, thus reducing AR-V7 protein levels and sensitizing prostate cancer cells to current anti-androgen therapies.

The anti-tumor effect of perforin was analyzed using prostate cancer (PC) PC-3 cells in which perforin expression was controlled by Tet-on system (PC-3PRF cells). Liposomes encapsulating PSA promoter-driven perforin expression vector (pLipo) were constructed for its specific expression in PC. The anti-tumor effect of pLipo was evaluated in vitro using docetaxel-resistant PC 22Rv1 PC cell line, 22Rv1DR, and PC-3 cells in the presence of human peripheral blood mono nuclear cells (PBMCs) and also in vivo using male nude mice bearing 22Rv1DR cell-derived tumor xenograft. Induction of perforin significantly inhibited growth of PC-3PRF cells. Treatment with pLipo induced perforin expression in 22Rv1DR cells expressing PSA but not in PC-3 cells lacking it. Treatment with pLipo at a low concentration was prone to inhibit growth of both cell lines and significantly inhibited growth of 22Rv1DR cells when co-incubated with PBMCs. The combined use of pLipo at a high concentration with PBMCs showed nearly complete inhibition of 22Rv1DR cell growth.

Despite this advance, questions remain regarding the use of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) for the treatment of this disease, including (i) how specifically do PARPi-sensitive tumor cells respond to treatment, and (ii) how does PARPi resistance develop? To address these questions, we characterized response to olaparib in sensitive LNCaP and C4-2B cells and developed two olaparib-resistant derivative cell line models from each, termed LN-OlapR and 2B-OlapR, respectively. OlapR cells possess distinct morphology from parental cells and display robust resistance to olaparib and other clinically relevant PARPis, including rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib. In LNCaP and C4-2B cells, we found that olaparib induces massive DNA damage, leading to activation of the G2-M checkpoint, activation of p53, and cell-cycle arrest. Furthermore, our data suggest that G2-M checkpoint activation leads to both cell death and senescence associated with p21 activity. In contrast, both LN-OlapR and 2B-OlapR cells do not arrest at G2-M and display a markedly blunted response to olaparib treatment. Interestingly, both OlapR cell lines harbor increased DNA damage relative to parental cells, suggesting that OlapR cells accumulate and manage persistent DNA damage during acquisition of resistance, likely through augmenting DNA repair capacity. Further impairing DNA repair through CDK1 inhibition enhances DNA damage, induces cell death, and sensitizes OlapR cells to olaparib treatment. Our data together further our understanding of PARPi treatment and provide a cellular platform system for the study of response and resistance to PARP inhibition.""","""['Alan P Lombard', 'Cameron M Armstrong', ""Leandro S D'Abronzo"", 'Shu Ning', 'Amy R Leslie', 'Masuda Sharifi', 'Wei Lou', 'Christopher P Evans', ""Marc Dall'Era"", 'Hong-Wu Chen', 'Xinbin Chen', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Activation of Wnt signaling promotes olaparib resistant ovarian cancer.', 'Targeting Plk1 to Enhance Efficacy of Olaparib in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'PARP-1 activity (PAR) determines the sensitivity of cervical cancer to olaparib.', 'PARP Inhibitors in Ovarian Cancer.', 'The promising PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancer therapy: From Olaparib to others.', 'Targeting senescence as an anticancer therapy.']"""

Genetic alteration of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is one of the key events in tumor development and progression in prostate cancer, with inactivation of the PTEN tumor suppressor being very common in this cancer type. Extensive evaluation has been performed on the therapeutic potential of PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and the resistance mechanisms arising in patients with PTEN-mutant background. However, in patients with a PTEN wild-type phenotype, PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors have not demonstrated efficacy, and this remains an area of clinical unmet need. In this study, we have investigated the response of PTEN wild-type prostate cancer cell lines to the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor DS-7423 alone or in combination with HER2 inhibitors or mGluR1 inhibitors. Upon treatment with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor DS-7423, PTEN wild-type prostate cancer CWR22/22RV1 cells upregulate expression of the proteins PSMA, mGluR1, and the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2, while PTEN-mutant LNCaP cells upregulate androgen receptor and HER3. PSMA, mGluR1, and HER2 exert control over one another in a positive feedback loop that allows cells to overcome treatment with DS-7423.

In comparison to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T, application of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 resulted in a significantly improved tumor dose but also higher kidney accumulation. Although rhPSMA-7.3 has been initially selected as the lead compound for diagnostic application based on the characterization of its gallium complex, a systematic comparison of the most promising 177Lu-labeled rhPSMA ligands is still missing. Thus, this study aimed to identify the rhPSMA ligand with the most favorable pharmacokinetics for 177Lu-radioligand therapy. Methods: The 4 isomers of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7 (namely [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7.1, -7.2, -7.3, and -7.4), along with the novel radiohybrid ligands [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 and -10.2, were compared with the state-of-the-art compounds [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. The comparative evaluation comprised affinity studies (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) and internalization experiments on LNCaP cells, as well as lipophilicity measurements. In addition, we determined the apparent molecular weight (AMW) of each tracer as a parameter for human serum albumin (HSA) binding. Biodistribution studies and small-animal SPECT imaging were performed on LNCaP-tumor bearing mice at 24 h after injection. Results: 177Lu labeling of the radiohybrids was performed according to the established procedures for the currently established PSMA-targeted ligands. All ligands showed potent binding to PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells, with affinities in the low nanomolar range and high internalization rates. Surprisingly, the most pronounced differences regarded the HSA-related AMW. Although [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7 isomers demonstrated the highest AMW and thus strongest HSA interactions, [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 showed an AMW lower than for [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 but higher than for the 177Lu-labeled references PSMA I&T and PSMA-617. In biodistribution studies, [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 exhibited the lowest kidney uptake and fastest excretion from the blood pool of all rhPSMA ligands while preserving a high tumor accumulation. Conclusion: Clinical investigation of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 is highly warranted to determine whether the favorable pharmacokinetics observed in mice will also result in high tumor uptake and decreased absorbed dose to kidneys and other nontarget tissues in patients.""","""['Alexander Wurzer', 'Jan-Philip Kunert', 'Sebastian Fischer', 'Veronika Felber', 'Roswitha Beck', 'Francesco de Rose', ""Calogero D'Alessandria"", 'Wolfgang Weber', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Comparative Preclinical Biodistribution, Dosimetry, and Endoradiotherapy in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using 19F/177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T.', 'Radiohybrid Ligands: A Novel Tracer Concept Exemplified by 18F- or 68Ga-Labeled rhPSMA Inhibitors.', 'Pretherapeutic Comparative Dosimetry of 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical comparison of four 18F, natGarhPSMA-7 isomers: influence of the stereoconfiguration on pharmacokinetics.', 'What a difference a methylene makes: replacing Glu with Asp or Aad in the Lys-urea-Glu pharmacophore of PSMA-targeting radioligands to reduce kidney and salivary gland uptake.', 'Investigation of the structure-activity relationship at the N-terminal part of minigastrin analogs.', 'Development of the First 18F-Labeled Radiohybrid-Based Minigastrin Derivative with High Target Affinity and Tumor Accumulation by Substitution of the Chelating Moiety.', '177 Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 Induces Tumor Response in a Patient With mCRPC After PSMA-Directed Radioligand Therapy With 177 Lu-PSMA-I&T.', 'Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligands for radioguided surgery of prostate cancer.', 'Introduction of a SiFA Moiety into the D-Glutamate Chain of DOTA-PP-F11N Results in Radiohybrid-Based CCK-2R-Targeted Compounds with Improved Pharmacokinetics In Vivo.']"""

SBRT has not been widely adopted but may have radiobiologic advantages over CFRT/MFRT. We hypothesized that SBRT would be associated with improved overall survival (OS) versus CFRT or MFRT ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for unfavorable-intermediate-risk prostate cancer (UIR-PCa).  Methods:   Men with UIR-PCa treated with SBRT (35-40Gy in ≤5 fractions) or biologically equivalent doses of CFRT (72-86.4Gy in 1.8-2.0Gy/fraction) or MRFT (≥60Gy in 2.4-3.2Gy/fraction; biologically effective doses ≥120) were identified in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Unweighted and propensity-weighted multivariable Cox analysis (MVA) was used to compare OS hazard ratios.  Results:   Of 28,028 men with UIR-PCa who received CFRT with (n = 12,872) or without ADT (n = 12,984); MFRT with (n = 251) or without ADT (n = 281); and SBRT with (n = 212) or without ADT (n = 1,428) were identified. Relative to CFRT without ADT, CFRT+ ADT (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.97, P = .002) and SBRT without ADT (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.89, P = .002) were both associated with improved OS on MVA. Relative to CFRT+ADT, SBRT without ADT correlated with improved OS on MVA (HR:0.81, 95% CI 0.67-0.99, P = .04). Propensity-weighted MVA demonstrated that SBRT (HR:0.80, 95% CI 0.65-0.98, P = .036) and ADT (HR:0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.97, P = .002) correlated with improved OS. SBRT was not associated with improved OS versus MFRT.  Conclusion:   SBRT, which offers a cheaper and shorter treatment course that mitigates COVID-19 exposure, was associated with improved OS versus CFRT for UIR-PCa. These results confirm guideline-based recommendations that SBRT is a viable option for UIR prostate cancer. The results from this large retrospective study require further validation in clinical trials.""","""['Neal Andruska', 'Benjamin W Fischer-Valuck', 'Temitope Agabalogun', 'Ruben Carmona', 'Randall J Brenneman', 'Yi Huang', 'Hiram A Gay', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Brian C Baumann']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Stereotactic body radiotherapy versus conventional/moderate fractionated radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy for unfavorable risk prostate cancer.', 'Assessing the impact of brachytherapy boost and androgen deprivation therapy on survival outcomes for patients with unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy.', 'Assessing the role of external beam radiation therapy in combination with brachytherapy versus brachytherapy alone for unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer-a review.']"""
