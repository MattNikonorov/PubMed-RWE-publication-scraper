Current clinical indicators are insufficient to accurately assess disease risk and radiotherapy response, emphasizing the urgent need for additional molecular prognostic markers.  Methods:   In order to investigate CAF-related genes associated with radiotherapy and construct prognostic CAF-related gene signatures for prostate cancer, we firstly established a radio-resistant prostate CAF cell subline (referred to as CAFR) from Mus-CAF (referred to as CAF) through fractionated irradiation using X-rays. Transcriptome sequencing for CAF and CAFR was conducted, and 2626 CAF-related differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with radiotherapy were identified. Human homologous genes of mouse CAF-related DEGs were then obtained.  Results:   Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these CAF-related DEGs were significantly enriched ECM- and immune-related functions and pathways. Based on GSE116918 dataset, 186 CAF-related DEGs were correlated with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) of prostate cancer patients, 16 of which were selected to construct a BCRFS-related CAF signature, such as ACPP, THBS2, and KCTD14; 142 CAF-related DEGs were correlated with metastasis-free survival (MFS), 16 of which were used to construct a MFS-related CAF signature, such as HOPX, TMEM132A, and ZNF467. Both Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets confirmed that the two CAF signatures accurately predicted BCRFS and MFS of prostate cancer patients. The risk scores were higher in patients with higher gleason grades and higher clinical T stages. Moreover, the BCRFS-related CAF signature was an independent prognostic factor and a nomogram consisting of BCRFS-related CAF signature and various clinical factors accurately predicted 2-, 3-, and 5-year survival time of prostate cancer patients. Furthermore, the risk score was positively correlated with multiple immune checkpoints.  Conclusions:   Our established CAF signatures could accurately predict BCRFS and MFS in prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy.""","""['Ran Zhang', 'Feng Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Gene signatures predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in primary prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'Characterization of cancer-related fibroblasts (CAF) in hepatocellular carcinoma and construction of CAF-based risk signature based on single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq data.', 'A fibroblast-associated signature predicts prognosis and immunotherapy in esophageal squamous cell cancer.', 'Novel Therapeutic Targets and Biomarkers Associated with Prostate Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs).', 'Fibroblast heterogeneity in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Comprehensive Analysis for Anti-Cancer Target-Indication Prioritization of Placental Growth Factor Inhibitor (PGF) by Use of Omics and Patient Survival Data.', 'LINC00963-FOSB-mediated transcription activation of UBE3C enhances radioresistance of breast cancer cells by inducing ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation of TP73.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts in radiotherapy: Bystanders or protagonists?']"""

Accumulating evidence has supported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in multiple biological processes. Nevertheless, the functions of most lncRNAs in PCa malignant progression remain largely unclear. Our current study is to elucidate the influence of lncRNA lncNAP1L6 on PCa malignant progression and uncover the possible regulatory mechanism. Firstly, RT-qPCR analysis was to detect lncNAP1L6 expression and suggested that lncNAP1L6 was markedly upregulated in PCa cells. Functional assays manifested that silencing of lncNAP1L6 hampered cell migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) while overexpression of lncNAP1L6 exacerbated cell migration, invasion and EMT. In addition, mechanism assays were to determine the latent regulatory mechanism of lncNAP1L6. It turned out that METTL14/METTL3 complex mediated m6A methylation of NAP1L2 mRNA. Besides, lncNAP1L6 recruited HNRNPC to m6A-modified NAP1L2, leading to stabilization of NAP1L2 mRNA. Moreover, NAP1L6 interacted with YY1 to promote the transcription of MMP2 and MMP9 and activate MMP signaling pathway. In summary, lncNAP1L6 was identified as an oncogene in PCa, which revealed that lncNAP1L6 might be used as potential therapeutic target in PCa.""","""['Yuxiao Zheng#', 'Feng Qi#', 'Lu Li#', 'Bin Yu#', 'Yifei Cheng', 'Minghui Ge', 'Chao Qin', 'Xiao Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""['m6 A modification of lncRNA PCAT6 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer through IGF2BP2-mediated IGF1R mRNA stabilization.', 'Knockdown of LncRNA SNHG7 inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer though miR-324-3p/WNT2B axis in vitro.', 'Silencing of METTL3 effectively hinders invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Long non-coding RNA VIM-AS1 promotes prostate cancer growth and invasion by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in pancreatic cancer progression.', 'Methyltransferase-like proteins in cancer biology and potential therapeutic targeting.', 'Long non-coding RNAs in bone metastasis: progresses and perspectives as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.', 'The m6A methylation landscape, molecular characterization and clinical relevance in prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Clinicians scored eleven radiotherapy-related toxicities (and baseline symptoms) with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. HRQoL was assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core HRQoL questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30). Statistical analyses used the mixed-model method; statistical significance was set at p = 0.01. Analyses were performed for baseline and subsequent time points up to 2 years after radiotherapy and per treatment modality, radiotherapy technique and disease stage.  Results:   Data of 435 patients were analysed. Pre-treatment, overall symptoms, dyspnea, chest wall pain, dysphagia and cough impacted overall HRQoL and specific domains. At subsequent time points, cough and dysphagia were overtaken by pericarditis in affecting HRQoL. Toxicities during concurrent chemo-radiotherapy and 3-dimensional radiotherapy had the most impact on HRQoL. Conversely, toxicities in sequential chemo-radiotherapy and SBRT had limited impact on patients' HRQoL. Stage impacts the correlations: LA-NSCLC patients are more adversely affected by toxicity than ES-NSCLC patients, mimicking the results of radiotherapy technique and treatment modality.  Conclusion:   Pre-treatment symptoms and acute/late toxicities variously impact HRQoL of ES- and LA-NSCLC patients undergoing different treatment approaches and radiotherapy techniques. Throughout the disease, dyspnea seems crucial in this association, highlighting the additional effect of co-existing comorbidities.

Methods:   Medical records of 592 patients who underwent bpMRI between August 2017 and March 2020 were examined for follow-up clinical activities. These include prostate biopsy, radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis, PET/CT, MRI Pelvis, and Nuclear Medicine Bone Scans. The charges for each clinical activity were derived from the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule to conservatively estimate revenues. This patient population was further divided into four groups: Group A, patients who demonstrated an MRI lesion and underwent prostatectomy; Group B, patients who did not demonstrate lesion but underwent prostatectomy; Group C, patients who demonstrated lesion but did not undergo prostatectomy; and Group D, patients who neither demonstrated lesion nor underwent prostatectomy. Revenues for each group were categorized by Urology, Radiation Oncology and Radiology subspecialties.  Results:   Conservative estimates yielded $520 of downstream revenue per patient who underwent bpMRI. Group A patients yielded 47% of total revenue ($1974 per patient). Group B patients, the smallest group, yielded $1828 per patient. Group C patients made up the largest group and grossed $398 per patient. Group D demonstrated the lowest per patient revenue of $179.

The diagnosis of prostate MRI often relies on accurate prostate zonal segmentation. However, state-of-the-art automatic segmentation methods often fail to produce well-contained volumetric segmentation of the prostate zones since certain slices of prostate MRI, such as base and apex slices, are harder to segment than other slices. This difficulty can be overcome by leveraging important multi-scale image-based information from adjacent slices, but current methods do not fully learn and exploit such cross-slice information. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-slice attention mechanism, which we use in a Transformer module to systematically learn cross-slice information at multiple scales. The module can be utilized in any existing deep-learning-based segmentation framework with skip connections. Experiments show that our cross-slice attention is able to capture cross-slice information significant for prostate zonal segmentation in order to improve the performance of current state-of-the-art methods. Cross-slice attention improves segmentation accuracy in the peripheral zones, such that segmentation results are consistent across all the prostate slices (apex, mid-gland, and base).

We have previously demonstrated that the cyclical administration of supraphysiological androgen (SPA), termed bipolar androgen therapy (BAT), can result in tumor regression and clinical benefit for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. However, predictors and mechanisms of response and resistance have been ill defined. Here, we show that growth inhibition of prostate cancer models by SPA required high androgen receptor (AR) activity and were driven in part by downregulation of MYC. Using matched sequential patient biopsies, we show that high pretreatment AR activity predicted downregulation of MYC, improved clinical response, and prolonged progression-free and overall survival for patients on BAT. BAT induced strong downregulation of AR in all patients, which is shown to be a primary mechanism of acquired resistance to SPA. Acquired resistance was overcome by alternating SPA with the AR inhibitor enzalutamide, which induced adaptive upregulation of AR and resensitized prostate cancer to SPA.

The high-lipid nutritional environment from intrauterine and throughout life favors the development of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and aggravated degenerative alterations in the gland.  Abstract:   Maternal obesity and high-fat diet (HFD) affect permanently prostate histophysiology in adulthood, but the consequences during aging are unknown. Here, we evaluated the prostate alterations in middle-aged rats subjected to a high-lipid nutritional environment (HLE) in different ontogenetic periods. Wistar rats (56 weeks of age) were assigned into groups exposed to standard nutrition (C) or HLE during gestation (G), gestation and lactation (GL), from lactation onward (L), from weaning onward (W) and from gestation onward (AL). HLE in the periods after weaning consisted of HFD (20% fat), and during gestation and lactation it also included previous maternal obesity induced by the HFD. HLE increased total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in all groups and led to insulin resistance in GL and AL and obesity in L. Serum testosterone levels decreased ~67% in GL, ~146% in L and W, and ~233% in AL. Histological and stereological analysis revealed an increment of the stromal compartment and collagen fibers in the prostates of all HLE groups, as well as degenerative lesions, such as cell vacuolation and prostate concretions. HLE aggravated acinar atrophy in G, GL, and L, and in AL it reached more than 50% of the prostate area for most animals. The foci of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia increased in AL. Tissue expression of androgen receptor did not vary among groups, except for a higher stromal expression for G and GL. Even when restricted to gestation and lactation, HLE induces diffuse acinar atrophy in the aging prostate and worsens degenerative and premalignant lesions when it continues throughout life.""","""['Tatiane Pereira Scarpelli', 'Eloisa Zanin Pytlowanciv', 'Maria Etelvina Pinto-Fochi', 'Sebasti√£o Roberto Taboga', 'Rejane Maira G√≥es']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Reproduction""","""['Differential ontogenetic exposure to obesogenic environment induces hyperproliferative status and nuclear receptors imbalance in the rat prostate at adulthood.', 'High-fat diet obesity associated with insulin resistance increases cell proliferation, estrogen receptor, and PI3K proteins in rat ventral prostate.', 'Fetal programming by high-fat diet promoted the decreased of the prostate in adult Wistar albino rats.', 'Maternal obesity accelerates rat offspring metabolic ageing in a sex-dependent manner.', 'Pre-Weaning Exposure to Maternal High-Fat Diet Is a Critical Developmental Window for Programming the Metabolic System of Offspring in Mice.']"""

Although regulations mandate that billing for urethral suspension is only acceptable for preexisting urinary incontinence, reductions in reimbursement may incentivize billing for the use of this procedure in other scenarios.  Objective:   To assess trends and geographic variations in payments for urethral suspension with robotic prostatectomy in the context of Medicare payment policy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This US population-based retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental Database for men with employer-based insurance (primary commercial or Medicare supplemental coverage) who underwent robotic prostatectomy (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] code 55866) between 2009 and 2019.  Exposures:   Time period and metropolitan statistical area of patient residence.  Main outcomes and measures:   Payment for urethral suspension (CPT code 51990) with robotic prostatectomy.  Results:   We identified 87 774 men with prostate cancer treated with robotic prostatectomy; 3352 (3.8%) had undergone urethral suspension. The mean (SD) patient age was 59.7 (6.5) years; 16 870 patients (19.2%) had Medicare supplemental coverage. From 2015 to 2016, median payments for robotic prostatectomy changed by -$358 (-17.0%) for Medicare beneficiaries vs -$9 (0%) for commercially insured patients. With urethral suspension vs without, median (IQR) episode payments for robotic prostatectomy were higher for commercially insured men ($3678 [$3090-$4503] vs $3322 [$2601-$4306]) and Medicare beneficiaries ($2927 [$2450-$3909] vs $2379 [$2014-$3512]). Compared with men treated between 2013 and 2015, those treated between 2016 and 2017 were twice as likely to undergo urethral suspension (8.5% vs 4.1%; odds ratio, 2.17 [95% CI, 1.96-2.38]). The proportion of patients who underwent urethral suspension was stable for 2018 to 2019 and 2016 to 2017 (8.5% vs 9.0%; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.96-1.18]). From 2015 to 2019, the proportion of patients who underwent urethral suspension was highest in Charleston, South Carolina (92.0%), Knoxville, Tennessee (66.0%), and Columbia, South Carolina (58.0%). These regions neighbored high-volume areas without patients who underwent prostatectomy with urethral suspension (eg, 146 patients in Greenville, South Carolina, and 173 in Nashville, Tennessee).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, urethral suspension was associated with increased costs for patients with both commercial insurance and Medicare. Patients treated between 2016 and 2017 were more likely than those treated between 2013 and 2015 to undergo this procedure. Geographic variation in use exceeded what was expected for the preexisting condition for which billing is permitted for Medicare beneficiaries.

To produce [18F]PARPi, [18F]FBA was radiosynthesized and purified using a cation-exchange cartridge, and then trapped by an anion-exchange resin cartridge, on which the solid-phase radiosynthesis was carried out to produce the desired product. [18F]PARPi was evaluated in vivo in breast and prostate xenograft tumor models by microPET imaging, biodistribution and autoradiography.  Results:   The best derivatives of olaparib were identified as compound 4, 7 and 8. [18F]4 ([18F]PARPi) was radiosynthesized in high radiochemical yield, high molar activity and high radiochemical purity using this SPS strategy. The in vivo evaluation of [18F]PARPi demonstrates the PARP-1 specific uptake of [18F]PARPi in the animal models.  Conclusions:   This method is simple and efficient, having great potential for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals starting from [18F]FBA or other radiolabeled aromatic acids. Using [18F]PARPi prepared by this method, we demonstrated the promise of [18F]PARPi in the nuclear imaging of PARP-1 expression.""","""['Jinbin Xu', 'Huaping Chen', 'Buck E Rogers', 'John A Katzenellenbogen', 'Dong Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Preliminary evaluation of a novel 18F-labeled PARP-1 ligand for PET imaging of PARP-1 expression in prostate cancer.', 'Positron-Emission Tomographic Imaging of a Fluorine 18-Radiolabeled Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 Inhibitor Monitors the Therapeutic Efficacy of Talazoparib in SCLC Patient-Derived Xenografts.', 'A one-pot radiosynthesis of 18 FPARPi.', 'The Development of 18F Fluorthanatrace: A PET Radiotracer for Imaging Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1.', 'Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1 Inhibitors Drug Discovery, Design, and Development as Anticancer Agents from Past to Present: A Mini-Review.']"""

However, the relationship between PCGEM1 and colorectal cancer is still unclear yet. This study is aimed at identifying the role of PCGEM1 in colorectal cancer. qRT-PCR was used to examine the expressions of the expression of lncRNA PCGEM1 and SOX4 in CRC tissues and cell lines. The biological functions of lncRNA PCGEM1 and SOX4 were examined by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assay, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, RNA interference, and gene overexpression techniques. Bioinformatics analysis was used to find the potential downstream molecule of PCGEM1 and miR-129-5p. The relationship between PCGEM1, miR-129-5p, and SOX4 was assessed by dual luciferase activity assay. We found that PCGEM1 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells and tissues, while miR-129-5p is underexpressed. SOX4 is overexpressed in colorectal cancer cells and tissues. Functionally, PCGEM1 silencing can significantly inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of colorectal cancer cells. Mechanically, PCGEM1 acted as a sponge for miR-129-5p and absorbed its expression, and miR-129-5p was found to target SOX4, constructing the axis of PCGEM1/miR-129-5p/SOX4 in colorectal cancer.

Patients undergoing robotic prostatectomy may have bullae, which may rupture leading to pneumothorax. We evaluated the incidence of pneumothorax due to preoperative bullae rupture in robotic prostatectomy.  Methods:   A large retrospective study of patients who underwent robotic prostatectomy between 2009 and 2021 was conducted. Bullae were detected using chest computed tomography. Pneumothorax was detected using a chest X-ray. The primary outcome was the incidence of pneumothorax due to bullae rupture. Secondary outcomes were the prevalence of preoperative bullae and the evaluation of postoperative outcomes, including length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission rate, and prolonged intensive care unit stay (> 2 days).  Results:   A total of 6605 patients were included. The prevalence of preoperative bullae was 3.0% (196/6,605). There was no incidence of pneumothorax due to bullae rupture. No significant difference in the incidences of pneumothorax between patients with and without bullae (0/196 vs. 2/6,409, P > 0.999) was observed. In addition, length of hospital stay, intensive care unit admission rate, and prolonged intensive care unit stay were not significantly different between the two groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that there was no significant difference in lengths of hospital stay between the two groups (log-rank test, P > 0.999).  Conclusion:   In our cohort, there was no incidence of pneumothorax following robotic prostatectomy in patients with preoperative bullae.

Met1-linked ubiquitination (M1-Ubi) is also involved in cancer progression, but the mechanism is poorly defined. Here we find that HOIP, one important component of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), promotes prostate cancer (PCa) progression by enhancing AKT signaling in a PTEN-dependent manner. Mechanistically, PTEN is modified by M1-Ubi at two sites K144 and K197, which significantly inhibits PTEN phosphatase activity and thus accelerates PCa progression. More importantly, we identify that the high-frequency mutants PTENR173H and PTENR173C in PCa patients showed the enhanced level of M1-Ubi, which impairs PTEN function in inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and cell growth. We also find that HOIP depletion sensitizes PCa cells to therapeutic agents BKM120 and Enzalutamide. Furthermore, the clinical data analyses confirm that HOIP is upregulated and positively correlated with AKT activation in PCa patient specimen, which may promote PCa progression and increase the risk of PCa biochemical relapse. Together, our study reveals a key role of PTEN M1-Ubi in regulation of AKT activation and PCa progression, which may propose a new strategy for PCa therapy.""","""['Yanmin Guo#', 'Jianfeng He#', 'Hailong Zhang#', 'Ran Chen#', 'Lian Li', 'Xiaojia Liu', 'Caihu Huang', 'Zhe Qiang', 'Zihan Zhou', 'Yanli Wang', 'Jian Huang', 'Xian Zhao', 'Junke Zheng', 'Guo-Qiang Chen', 'Jianxiu Yu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['Muscleblind-like 1 antisense RNA 1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer by sponging miR-181a-5p and regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'Molecular aspects of gefitinib antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in PTEN-positive and PTEN-negative prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Depletion of SAG/RBX2 E3 ubiquitin ligase suppresses prostate tumorigenesis via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Semisynthetic Approach to the Analysis of Tumor Suppressor PTEN Ubiquitination.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Functional analysis of PTEN variants of unknown significance from PHTS patients unveils complex patterns of PTEN biological activity in disease.']"""

Aim:   To determine the prevalence and predictors of early erectile function recovery post-RP and of worsening erectile function after initial erectile function recovery.  Methods:   We retrospectively queried our institutional database. Men who underwent RP during 2008-2017 and who completed the International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain both pre-RP and serially post-RP, constituted the population. Functional erections were defined as International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-6 erectile function domain scores ‚â•24. We analyzed factors predicting functional erections at 3 months post-RP as well as factors predicting a decrease in functional erections between 3 and 6 months, defined as ‚â•2-point drop in the erectile function domain. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of early erectile function recovery and also of subsequent decline.  Outcomes:   Erectile function recovery rates at 3 months post-RP and predictive factors; rates of erectile function decline between 3-6 months and associated predictors.  Results:   Eligible patients comprised 1,655 men with median age of 62 (IQR 57, 67) years. Bilateral nerve-sparing (NS) surgery was performed in 71% of men, unilateral NS in 19%, and no NS in 10%. Of this population, 224 men (14%; 95% CI 12%, 15%) had functional erections at 3 months post-RP. On multivariable analysis, significant predictors of early erectile function recovery included: younger age (OR 0.93, P < .001), higher baseline erectile function domain score (OR 1.14, P < .001) and bilateral NS (OR 3.81, P = .002). The presence of diabetes (OR 0.43, P = .028) and a former smoking history (OR 0.63, P = .008; reference group: never smoker) was associated with the erectile dysfunction at 3 months post-RP. Of the men with early functional erections, 41% (95% CI 33%, 48%) had a ‚â• 2-point decline in erectile function between 3 and 6 months. No factors were identified as predictors for this decline.  Clinical implications:   Only a small proportion of men have functional erections at 3 months post-RP and a notable number of them will experience a decline in erectile function between 3 and 6 months.  Strengths and limitations:   Strengths: large patient population and the use of validated questionnaire.  Limitations:   single-center retrospective study.  Conclusion:   A minority of men had functional erections 3 months post-RP, about half of whom had a decline in erectile function by month 6. We recommend appropriately counseling post-RP patients on the risk of such a decline in erectile function. Salter CA, Tin AL, Bernie HL, et al.

We aimed to test the benefit of RC in SBC, and to perform a direct comparison vs urothelial bladder cancer (UCB).  Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER 2001-2018) all non-metastatic SBC and UBC patients were identified. Endpoint of interest was CSM. Propensity score matching (PSM), cumulative incidence plots, competing risks regression (CRR) analyses, three-months landmark analyses, and sensitivity analyses were performed. All results were stratified according to organ-confined (OC: T2N0M0) vs non-organ-confined (NOC: T3-4N0M0 or TanyN1-3M0) stages.  Results:   Of 554 SBC patients, 49 vs 51% harbored OC vs NOC stages.

We investigated whether the commonly used vaccine adjuvant, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) could augment the ISV regimen consisting of combination RT and ICI.  Materials/methods:   We used syngeneic murine models of melanoma (B78) and prostate cancer (Myc-CaP). Tumor-bearing mice received either RT (12 Gy, day 1), RT+anti-CTLA-4 (C4, day 3, 6, 9), MPL (20 ¬µg IT injection days 5, 7, 9), RT+C4+MPL, or PBS control. To evaluate the effect of MPL on the irradiated tumor microenvironment, primary tumor with tumor draining lymph nodes were harvested for immune cell infiltration analysis and cytokine profiling, and serum was collected for analysis of antitumor antibody populations.  Results:   Combination RT+C4+MPL significantly reduced tumor growth, increased survival and complete response rate compared with RT+C4 in both B78 and Myc-CaP models. MPL favorably reprogrammed the irradiated tumor-immune microenvironment toward M1 macrophage and Th1 TBET+CD4+ T cell polarization. Furthermore, MPL significantly increased intratumoral expression of several Th1-associated and M1-associated proinflammatory cytokines. In co-culture models, MPL-stimulated macrophages directly activated CD8 T cells and polarized CD4 cells toward Th1 phenotype. MPL treatment significantly increased production of Th1-associated, IgG2c antitumor antibodies, which were required for and predictive of antitumor response to RT+C4+MPL, and enabled macrophage-mediated antibody-dependent direct tumor cell killing by MPL-stimulated macrophages. Macrophage-mediated tumor cell killing was dependent on FcŒ≥R expression. In metastatic models, RT and MPL generated a systemic antitumor immune response that augmented response to ICIs. This was dependent on macrophages and CD4+ but not CD8+T cells.  Conclusions:   We report the potential for MPL to augment the ISV effect of combination RT+C4 through FcŒ≥R, macrophage, and TBET+CD4+ Th1 cell dependent mechanisms. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing generation of a CD8+ T cell-independent, Th1 polarized, systemic antitumor immune response with subsequent generation of immunologic memory.

However, specific delivery of siRNAs to tumors remains a major challenge. The recent success of siRNA delivery to the liver has incentivized the development of biomaterials for siRNA delivery into tumors. Here, we report a new class of amino acid-modified lipids for siRNA delivery to cancer cells. Eight lipids were developed by headgroup modification with histidine and lysine. The lipids were screened in PC3-luciferase stable cells for gene silencing and cellular cytotoxicity study. The best lipid LHHK shows a pKa of 6.08, which is within the optimal pKa range of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for siRNA delivery. The LHHK LNP protects siRNA from serum degradation for up to 24 h and shows higher endosomal release and better cellular uptake compared to other lysine-modified lipids in PC3 cells. The LHHK LNP exhibits significant silencing activity of IKKŒ± and IKBKE in prostate cancer and pancreatic cancer, respectively. Moreover, the LHHK LNP encapsulating IKBKE siRNA inhibits cell proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells and suppresses the tumor progression in a pancreatic cancer mouse model. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) is a promising platform for siRNA delivery. However, LNP is generally associated with high systemic toxicity. As a result, efficient and biodegradable lipids are highly needed for siRNA-based cancer therapy. Herein, we develop amino acid-modified biodegradable lipids. These lipids show very low cellular toxicity and high transfection efficiency. The best lipid LHHK shows a pKa of 6.08, which is within the optimal pKa range of LNPs for siRNA delivery.

Chemotherapy is a common treatment for PCa but the development of resistance is often a problem during therapy. NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) is one of the major transcription factors regulating antioxidant enzymes and is also involved with drug efflux and detoxification. Cancer cells submitted to chemotherapy often promote NRF2 activation to benefit themselves with the cytoprotective response. Here, we found that DU145 and PC3 PCa cell lines have different responses regarding NRF2 activation, when subjected to arsenite-induced stress, even in the presence of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. We also observed that only in PC3 cells treated with arsenite, NRF2 was able to translocate to the nucleus. To better understand the role of NRF2 in promoting chemoresistance, we performed CRISPR knockout of NRF2 (NKO) in DU145 and PC3 cells. The effectiveness of the knockout was confirmed through the downregulation of NRF2 targets (p < 0.0001). PC3 NKO cells exhibited higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to wild-type cells (p < 0.0001), while this alteration was not observed in DU145 NKO cells. Despite no modulation in ROS content, a lower IC50 value (p < 0.05) for cisplatin was observed in DU145 NKO cells, suggesting that the knockout sensitized the cells to the treatment. Besides, the treatment of DU145 NKO with cisplatin led cells to apoptosis as observed by the increased levels of PARP1 cleavage (p < 0.05), possibly triggered by increased DNA damage. Reduced levels of KU70 and phospho-CHK2 (p < 0.05) were also detected. The data presented here support that NRF2 is a mediator of oncogenesis and could be a potential target to sensitize PCa cells to chemotherapy, reinforcing the importance of knowing the specific genetic and biochemical characteristics of the cancer cells for a more effective approach against cancer.""","""['Mariana C S Mancini', 'Ana P Morelli', 'Matheus B Severino', 'Isadora C B Pavan', '√ârika P Zambalde', 'Mariana M G√≥is', 'Luiz G S da Silva', 'Nathalia Quintero-Ruiz', 'Caio F Romeiro', 'Daniel F G Dos Santos', 'Ros√¢ngela M N Bezerra', 'Fernando M Simabuco']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 activity controls 4-hydroxynonenal metabolism and activity in prostate cancer cells.', 'Differential response of DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells to ionizing radiation: role of reactive oxygen species, GSH and Nrf2 in radiosensitivity.', 'Nrf2 sensitizes prostate cancer cells to radiation via decreasing basal ROS levels.', 'Nrf2 signaling pathway in cisplatin chemotherapy: Potential involvement in organ protection and chemoresistance.', 'NRF2 modulation in TRAMP mice: an in vivo model of prostate cancer.', 'Temozolomide Resistance in Glioblastoma by NRF2: Protecting the Evil.', 'Health Benefits of Coffee Consumption for Cancer and Other Diseases and Mechanisms of Action.']"""

In men with biopsy GG2 without CR/IDC (n = 196), clinicopathologic features were compared between those with GG1 or GG2 without CR/IDC on RP (GG ‚â§ 2-) and those with GG2 with CR/IDC or any GG > 2 (GG ‚â• 2+).

Identification of diagnostic biomarkers for early detection of BC is one of the most effective ways to reduce the mortality. Methods: Plasma samples from BC patients (n = 120) and normal controls (n = 50) were collected to determine the differentially expressed circulating miRNAs in BC patients. Binary logistic regression was applied to develop miRNA diagnostic models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to calculate the area under the curve (AUC). MMTV-PYMT mammary tumor mice were used to validate the expression change of those circulating miRNAs. Plasma samples from patients with other tumor types were collected to determine the specificity of the model in diagnosis of BC. Results: In the screening phase, 5 circulating miRNAs (miR-16, miR-17, miR-19b, miR-27a, and miR-106a) were identified as the most significantly upregulated miRNAs in plasma of BC patients. In consistence, the 5 miRNAs showed upregulation in the circulation of additional 80 BC patients in a tumor stage-dependent manner. Application of a tumor-burden mice model further confirmed upregulation of the 5 miRNAs in circulation. Based on these data, five models with diagnostic potential of BC were developed. Among the 5 miRNAs, miR-19b ranked at the top position with the highest specificity and the biggest contribution. In combination with miR-16 and miR-106a, a miR-19b-based 3-circulating miRNA model was selected as the best for further validation. Taken the samples together, the model showed 92% of sensitivity and 90% of specificity in diagnosis of BC. In addition, three other tumor types including prostate cancer, thyroid cancer and colorectal cancer further verified the specificity of the BC diagnostic model.

Human six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate (STEAP) proteins have been recognized and utilized as promising targets for cell- and antibody-based immunotherapy. One STEAP family member, STEAP4, is expected to be an attractive biomarker for the immunotherapy of prostate and breast cancer. However, the immunotherapeutic role of STEAP4 for colorectal carcinomas has not been demonstrated.  Aim:   To explore the expression pattern of STEAPs in CRC and their relationship with immune infiltration, and investigate the potential utilization of STEAPs as novel prognostic indicators in colorectal carcinomas.  Methods:   The expression level of STEAPs in CRC was evaluated using various open-resource databases and online tools to explore the expression characteristics and prognostic significance of STEAPs, as well as their correlation with immune-related biomarkers, such as immune infiltration. Immunohistochemical (IHC) experiments were subsequently performed to verify the database conclusions.  Results:   The levels of STEAPs in CRC were inconsistent. The expression of STEAPs 1-3 in CRC was not significantly different from that in normal tissues. However, STEAP4 mRNA levels were significantly lower in CRC than in normal tissue and were positively correlated with immune-related biomarkers, such as immune cell infiltration, immune stimulation, major histocompatibility complex levels, and chemokines. Interestingly, the expression of STEAP4 in microsatellite instability-high CRC subtype was higher than that in microsatellite stability subtype. IHC staining was performed on colon cancer tissue samples and showed that high expression of STEAP4 in adjacent tissues positively correlated with immune-related biomarkers, including MLH1, MLH6, and PMS2, but negatively correlated with programmed death ligand 1, to varying degrees.  Conclusion:   Our results provide an analysis of the expression of STEAP family members in CRC. Among different STEAP family members, STEAP4 plays a different role in CRC compared to STEAPs 1-3. In CRC, STEAP4 expression is not only lower than that in normal tissues, but it is also positively correlated with immune infiltration and immune-related biomarkers.

The reason for this differential response is not clear.

In a large dataset of 7,707 men with advanced prostate cancer undergoing comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) of cell-free DNA (cfDNA), 614 men harbored BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 alterations. Differences in the genomic landscape of co-segregating genes was investigated by Fisher's exact test and probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Results demonstrated that BRCA1 was significantly associated with six other genes, while BRCA2 was not significantly associated with any gene. These findings suggest BRCA2 may be the main driver mutation, while BRCA1 mutations tend to co-segregate with mutations in other molecular pathways contributing to prostate cancer progression.

Methods:   We compared the sequence of PSMA with the entire human proteome to identify proteins closely related to the target.

The affinity of compound 1 for PSMA, GCPIII, NAALADL-1, and TfR1 was measured by fluorescence polarization. The expression of the putative anti-target GCPIII was assessed by immunofluorescence on human salivary glands and kidney, using commercially available antibodies.  Results:   A fluorescent derivative of Pluvicto‚Ñ¢ (compound 1) bound tightly to PSMA and to GCPIII in fluorescence polarization experiments, while no interaction was observed with NAALADL-1 and TfR1. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed abundant expression of GCPIII both in healthy human kidney and salivary glands.

Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 548 patients underwent TBx + SBx of the prostate and then RP, with pathology revealing Gleason score 3 + 4, 4 + 3, or 4 + 4 disease.  Intervention:   TBx + SBx of the prostate followed by RP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   GP 4 fraction thresholds of ‚â§5%, ‚â§10%, ‚â§15%, ‚â§20%, and ‚â§25% were compared between the TBx + SBx and RP specimens.

For high-risk communities to better understand the usefulness of basic research about PCa, a strategy of social appropriation of knowledge (SAK) in science and cancer was designed and implemented. A pedagogical activity and two tests (a pre-test and a post-test) were applied to middle education students in four schools in three Colombian cities to identify previous knowledge of biology concepts and cancer perceptions. As for biology concepts, there was a statistically significant increase (p < 0.01) in the total results of all questions in the post-test, especially in items related to the structure of DNA, differences between RNA and DNA, and codon. Similarly, better success rates were observed in questions about replication and mutation, and a statistically significant improvement related to the definition of cancer, cancer prevention, and its association with culture or ethnicity (p < 0.01). The results of the open question show what students learned about or were interested in the most, as evidence of the exchange of knowledge in those cities and the social appropriation of knowledge about PCa in Colombia. These findings show that this type of intervention, in diverse social contexts, is essential to improve understanding and perceptions that link school and scientific knowledge to a real problem, such as health and, in this case, cancer.""","""['Paula Daniela Morales-Su√°rez', 'Wendy Johana Montero-Ovalle', 'Paula Juliana Pardo-Sanabria', 'Juan Camilo Cuestas-Casta√±eda', 'Yenifer Yamile Segura-Moreno', 'Marcela Nu√±ez-Lemus', 'Mar√≠a Carolina Sanabria-Salas', 'Rodolfo Varela-Ram√≠rez', 'Martha Luc√≠a Serrano']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Educ""","""['Health literacy on HIV infection among adolescents in the Czech Republic: a case study of two Czech cities Plze&#328; and &#268;esk√© Bud&#283;jovice.', 'Medical student researchers in Colombia and associated factors with publication: a cross-sectional study.', '""Cancer--Educate to Prevent""--high-school teachers, the new promoters of cancer prevention education campaigns.', 'Student and educator experiences of maternal-child simulation-based learning: a systematic review of qualitative evidence protocol.', 'School-based education programmes for the prevention of unintentional injuries in children and young people.']"""

Better treatment of metastasis, the main cause of cancer deaths, is therefore urgently required. Several of these tumours have been shown to have an abnormally high concentration of Na+ ([Na+ ]) and emerging evidence points to this accumulation being due to elevated intracellular [Na+ ]. This poses intriguing questions about the cellular mechanisms underlying Na+ dysregulation in cancer, and its pathophysiological significance. Elevated intracellular [Na+ ] may be due to alterations in activity of the Na+ /K+ -ATPase, and/or increased influx via Na+ channels and Na+ -linked transporters. Maintenance of the electrochemical Na+ gradient across the plasma membrane is vital to power many cellular processes that are highly active in cancer cells, including glucose and glutamine import. Na+ channels are also upregulated in cancer cells, which in turn promotes tumour growth and metastasis. For example, ENaC and ASICs are overexpressed in cancers, increasing invasion and proliferation. In addition, voltage-gated Na+ channels are also upregulated in a range of tumour types, where they promote metastatic cell behaviours via various mechanisms, including membrane potential depolarisation and altered pH regulation. Together, recent findings relating to elevated Na+ in the tumour microenvironment and how this may be regulated by several classes of Na+ channels provide a link between altered Na+ handling and poor clinical outcome. There are new opportunities to leverage this altered Na+ microenvironment for therapeutic benefit, as exemplified by several ongoing clinical trials.""","""['Theresa K Leslie', 'William J Brackenbury']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Physiol""","""['Sodium homeostasis in the tumour microenvironment.', 'Functional expression of voltage-gated sodium channels in primary cultures of human cervical cancer.', 'Overexpression of NaV 1.6 channels is associated with the invasion capacity of human cervical cancer.', 'Therapeutic potential for phenytoin: targeting Na(v)1.5 sodium channels to reduce migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer.', 'Voltage-Gated K+/Na+ Channels and Scorpion Venom Toxins in Cancer.', 'Role of epithelial sodium channel-related inflammation in human diseases.', 'The Yin and Yang of Breast Cancer: Ion Channels as Determinants of Left-Right Functional Differences.', 'SCN5A channelopathy: arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, epilepsy and beyond.', 'Adhesion to the Brain Endothelium Selects Breast Cancer Cells with Brain Metastasis Potential.']"""

Our aim was to describe the complete care pathways of all cancer decedents in Norway during the last six months of life.  Methods:   We used six national registries linked at patient level and including all cancer decedents in Norway between 2009-2013 to describe patient use of secondary, primary-, and home- and community-based care. We described patient's car pathway, including patients living situation, healthcare utilization, and costs. We then estimated how cancer type, individual and sociodemographic characteristics, and access to informal care influenced the care pathways. Regression models were used depending on the outcome, i.e., negative binomial (for healthcare utilization) and generalized linear models (for healthcare costs).  Results:   In total, 52,926 patients were included who died of lung (16%), colorectal (12%), prostate (9%), breast (6%), cervical (1%) or other (56%) cancers. On average, patients spent 123 days at home, 24 days in hospital, 16 days in short-term care and 24 days in long-term care during their last 6 months of life. Healthcare utilization increased towards end-of-life. Total costs were high (on average, NOK 379,801). 60% of the total costs were in the secondary care setting, 3% in the primary care setting, and 37% in the home- and community-based care setting. Age (total cost-range NOK 361,363-418,618) and marital status (total cost-range NOK354,100-411,047) were stronger determining factors of care pathway than cancer type (total cost-range NOK341,318- 392,655). When patients died of cancer types requiring higher amounts of secondary care (e.g., cervical cancer), there was a corresponding lower utilization of primary, and home- and community-based care, and vice versa.  Conclusion:   Cancer patient's care pathways at end-of-life are more strongly associated with age and access to informal care than underlying type of cancer. More care in one care setting (e.g., the secondary care) is associated with less care in other settings (primary- and home- and community based care setting) as demonstrated by the substitution between the different levels of care in this study. Care at end-of-life should therefore not be evaluated in one healthcare level alone since this might bias results and lead to suboptimal priorities.""","""['Gudrun Bj√∏rnelv', 'Terje P Hagen', 'Leena Forma', 'Eline Aas']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Till death do us part: the effect of marital status on health care utilization and costs at end-of-life.

We also report dosimetry data of 177Lu-PSMA-TO1/-617 in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   First, PET images of 68Ga-PSMA-TO-1/-617/-11 were acquired on consecutive days in three mice bearing subcutaneous C4-2 xenografts. Second, 50 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice received either 30 MBq of 177Lu-PSMA-617 or 177Lu-PSMA-TO-1 and were sacrificed at 1, 4, 24, 48 and 168 h for ex vivo gamma counting and biodistribution. Third, mice bearing disseminated lesions via intracardiac inoculation were treated with either 40 kBq of 225Ac-PSMA-617, 225Ac-PSMA-TO-1, or remained untreated and followed for survival. Additionally, 3 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients received 500 MBq of 177Lu-PSMA-TO-1 under compassionate use for dosimetry purposes. Planar images with an additional SPECT/CT acquisition were acquired for dosimetry calculations.  Results:   Tumor uptake measured by PET imaging of 68Ga-labeled agents in mice was highest using PSMA-617, followed by PSMA-TO-1 and PSMA-11. 177Lu-PSMA tumor uptake measured by ex vivo gamma counting at subsequent time points tended to be greater for PSMA-TO-1 up to 1 week following treatment (p > 0.13 at all time points). This was, however, accompanied by increased kidney uptake and a 26-fold higher kidney dose of PSMA-TO-1 compared with PSMA-617 in mice. Mice treated with a single-cycle 225Ac-PSMA-TO-1 survived longer than those treated with 225Ac-PSMA-617 and untreated mice, respectively (17.8, 14.5 and 7.7 weeks, respectively; p < 0.0001). Kidney, salivary gland, bone marrow and mean ¬± SD tumor dose coefficients (Gy/GBq) for 177Lu-PSMA-TO-1 in patients #01/#02/#03 were 2.5/2.4/3.0, 1.0/2.5/2.3, 0.14/0.11/0.10 and 0.42 ¬± 0.03/4.45 ¬± 0.07/1.8 ¬± 0.57, respectively.  Conclusions:   PSMA-TO-1 tumor uptake tended to be greater than that of PSMA-617 in both preclinical and clinical settings. Mice treated with 225Ac-PSMA-TO-1 conferred a significant survival benefit compared to 225Ac-PSMA-617 despite the accompanying increased kidney uptake. In humans, PSMA-TO-1 dosimetry estimates suggest increased tumor absorbed doses; however, the kidneys, salivary glands and bone marrow are also exposed to higher radiation doses.

KiSS1 was originally identified as a metastasis suppressor gene in metastatic melanoma and breast cancer, but its role in prostate cancer has been contradictory. This study was therefore undertaken to investigate the effects of KiSS1 overexpression on the growth and migration of human metastatic prostate cancer cells. We first tested the effect of KiSS1 overexpression on the growth and migration of DU145 human metastatic prostate cancer cells in vitro. DU145 cells were infected with the culture medium of 293T cells, which produce lentivirus particles containing KiSS1. A 2.5-fold increase in proliferation of KiSS1-overexpressing cancer cells was observed, and these cells formed tumor spheroids about 3 times larger than the vector control group. qPCR and immunoblotting revealed the association between increased cell growth and regulation of the PI3K/Akt and cell cycle genes, and also that increases in Œ≤-catenin and CD133 contribute to tumor aggregation. KiSS1 overexpression resulted in upregulation of the Œ≤-arrestin1/2 and Raf-MEK-ERK-NF-Œ∫B pathways via KiSS1R. Moreover, the migration and invasion of KiSS1-overexpressing cells were determined to be faster than the control group, along with 1.6-fold increased metastatic colonization of the KiSS1-overexpressing cancer cells. These were associated to the regulation of EMT gene expressions, such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin, and the upregulation of MMP9. In a xenograft mouse model inoculated with DU145 cells infected GFP or KiSS1 via a lentiviral vector, KiSS1 statistically significantly increased the tumor growth, with upregulation of PCNA and Ki-67 in the tumor tissues. In addition, KiSS1 increased the angiogenic capacity by upregulating VEGF-A and CD31, both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results indicate that KiSS1 not only induces prostate cancer proliferation, but also promotes metastasis by increasing the migration, invasion, and angiogenesis of malignant cells.""","""['Cho-Won Kim', 'Hong Kyu Lee', 'Min-Woo Nam', 'Gabsang Lee', 'Kyung-Chul Choi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Overexpression of KiSS1 Induces the Proliferation of Hepatocarcinoma and Increases Metastatic Potential by Increasing Migratory Ability and Angiogenic Capacity.', 'KiSS1 suppresses TNFalpha-induced breast cancer cell invasion via an inhibition of RhoA-mediated NF-kappaB activation.', 'KISS1/KISS1R mediates Sertoli cell apoptosis via the\xa0PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in a high‚Äëglucose environment.', 'KISS1 in breast cancer progression and autophagy.', 'The Kiss-1/Kiss-1R complex as a negative regulator of cell motility and cancer metastasis (Review).', 'KISS1 metastasis suppressor in tumor dormancy: a potential therapeutic target for metastatic cancers?']"""

Up to now, it is the single tool predicting either the side and the amount of ECE. The model has a free user-friendly interface and is made up from simple and available covariates, namely age, PSA, cT, GS and percent of positive core, the latter topographically distributed within the prostate gland. Despite the successful performance at internal validation, the model is still lacking an external validation (EV). The aim of the paper is to externally validate the PRECE model on an Italian cohort of patients elected to RARP.  Methods:   269 prostatic lobes from 141 patients represented the validation dataset. The EV was performed with the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and calibration, to address the ability of PRECE to discriminate between patients with or without ECE.  Results:   Overall, an ECE was found in 91 out of the 269 prostatic lobes (34%). Twenty-five patients out of pT3 had a bilateral ECE. The ROC curve showed an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.74-0.85). Sensitivity and specificity were 77% and 69%, respectively. The model showed an acceptable calibration with tendency towards overestimation.

Knockdown of TMEM147-AS1 or ZNF587 within prostate cancer cells significantly restrained cell viability, invasion and aerobic glycolysis in vitro and suppressed the neoplasia of prostatic carcinoma in vivo. miR-133b was directly targeted in both TMEM147-AS1 and ZNF587. Overexpression of miR-133b restrained prostate cancer cell viability, invasion and aerobic glycolysis. TMEM147-AS1 competitively targeted miR-133b, therefore counteracting miR-133b-mediated repression on ZNF587.  Conclusions:   TMEM147-AS1 plays a tumor-promoting action in prostatic carcinoma aerobic glycolysis via affecting the miR-133b/ZNF587 axis, therefore regulating prostatic carcinoma cells invasion and proliferation. These outcomes implied that TMEM147-AS1 could be an effective treatment strategy for further study of prostatic carcinoma.""","""['Tao Wu', 'Niwei Han', 'Changyong Zhao', 'Xiang Huang', 'Peng Su', 'Xiaoguang Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Gene Med""","""['Long non-coding RNA NCK1-AS1 functions as a ceRNA to regulate cell viability and invasion in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma via microRNA-133b/ENPEP axis.', 'Long noncoding RNA HOXD-AS1 promotes non-small cell lung cancer migration and invasion through regulating miR-133b/MMP9 axis.', 'SQLE facilitates the pancreatic cancer progression via the lncRNA-TTN-AS1/miR-133b/SQLE axis.', 'Downregulation of lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 Represses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through Mediating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling by miR-342-3p/CUL4B Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Long non-coding RNA TP73-AS1 sponges miR-194 to promote colorectal cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion via up-regulating TGFŒ±.', 'MicroRNAs and Gene Regulatory Networks Related to Cleft Lip and Palate.']"""

Tumor cells with DNA damage response and repair (DDR) gene loss-of-function mutation is sensitivity to poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and platinum chemotherapy in ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancers. There is a case report demonstrated the efficacy of PARP inhibitor for BRCA2 mutation that belongs to DDR gene in HCC, which suggested the potential role of PARP inhibitor for HCC with DDR gene mutation.  Patient concerns:   We reported a 44-year-old woman with non-viral HCC who was refractory to multiple treatment including target therapy, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy. The tumor tissue was submitted to next-generation sequencing using the commercially available ACTOnco¬Æ+ (ACT Genomics, Taiwan) assay that interrogates 440 and 31 cancer-related genes and fusion genes, respectively.  Diagnosis:   A truncating mutation FANCA p.Q1307fs was also observed. The tumor was microsatellite stable and had low tumor mutational burden of 4.5 muts/Mb.  Interventions and outcomes:   Given FANCA belongs to DDR genes, the inactivation evoked the idea of using PARP inhibitor and cisplatin. Therefore, the patient started to use olaparib combined with low-dose cisplatin (30 mg/m2, every 4 weeks) therapy in December 2019. Significant reduction in the tumor marker level in 1 month (PIVKA-II from 17,395 to 411 ng/dL) and follow-up CT scan showed stable disease. Her tumor did not progress until December 2020 with a progression-free survival of 12 months.  Lessons:   We report the first case of FANCA-mutated HCC that responded well to olaparib and low-dose cisplatin. This addressed the potential therapeutic role of DDR gene mutation in HCC and the possible synergistic effect of PARP inhibitor and cisplatin. These findings highlight areas where further investigation and effort are needed.""","""['Yi-Hsuan Lai', 'Kai-Che Tung', 'San-Chi Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Response to olaparib in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with germline BRCA2 mutation: a case report.', 'Baseline clinical predictors of antitumor response to the PARP inhibitor olaparib in germline BRCA1/2 mutated patients with advanced ovarian cancer.', 'Response to olaparib in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with germline BRCA2 mutation: a case report.', 'Clinical Application of Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.', 'Olaparib for the treatment of BRCA-mutated advanced ovarian cancer.']"""

Herewith we present further outcomes with a minimum of 5 years post-implant follow-up.  Methods and materials:   Outcomes of 30 HG implants and 362 whole-gland (WG) brachytherapy controls were monitored with IPSS, urinary Quality-of-Life (QoLU), GI component of EORTC-PR25 (QoLB), and IIEF-5 instruments, and PSA values. The median (range) follow-up for HG and WG cases was 72 (60-96) months and 84 (24-144) months respectively.  Results:   The IPSS was significantly reduced in HG relative to WG patients and trends indicating improved bowel QoL and erectile function were observed. The mean of change in PSA from baseline to last follow-up was -5.6 and -6.5 in HG and WG respectively (p = 0.1). The mean time to nadir was 4.2 and 4.8 years in HG and WG respectively (p = 0.06). Over time PSA in HG patients mirrored the sustained decline observed in WG cases but levels were higher by an average 0.5 ng/ml over WG controls (p < 0.001).

Materials and methods:   Oligometastatic cancer patients bearing up to five synchronous metastases (visceral or bone, including vertebral ones) and candidates for surgery or radiosurgery were considered for inclusion. 25 Gy was delivered in 10 daily fractions (2 weeks) to the metastatic lesion, affected vertebrae and adjacent ones (one cranial and one caudal vertebra). Sequentially, the dose to spinal metastases was progressively increased (8 Gy, 10 Gy, 12 Gy) in the patient cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicities were defined as any treatment-related non-hematologic acute adverse effects rated as grade ‚â•3 or any acute haematological toxicity rated as ‚â• 4 by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale.  Results:   Fifty-two lesions accounting for 40 consecutive patients (male/female: 29/11; median age: 71 years; range 40-85) were treated from April 2011 to September 2020.

Recently, a promising technique, proton-acoustic (PA) imaging, has been developed to provide real-timein vivo3D dose verification. However, its dosimetry accuracy is limited due to the limited-angle view of the ultrasound transducer. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based method to address the limited-view issue in the PA reconstruction. A deep cascaded convolutional neural network (DC-CNN) was proposed to reconstruct 3D high-quality radiation-induced pressures using PA signals detected by a matrix array, and then derive precise 3D dosimetry from pressures for dose verification in proton therapy. To validate its performance, we collected 81 prostate cancer patients' proton therapy treatment plans. Dose was calculated using the commercial software RayStation and was normalized to the maximum dose. The PA simulation was performed using the open-source k-wave package. A matrix ultrasound array with 64 √ó 64 sensors and 500 kHz central frequency was simulated near the perineum to acquire radiofrequency (RF) signals during dose delivery. For realistic acoustic simulations, tissue heterogeneity and attenuation were considered, and Gaussian white noise was added to the acquired RF signals. The proposed DC-CNN was trained on 204 samples from 69 patients and tested on 26 samples from 12 other patients. Predicted 3D pressures and dose maps were compared against the ground truth qualitatively and quantitatively using root-mean-squared-error (RMSE), gamma-index (GI), and dice coefficient of isodose lines. Results demonstrated that the proposed method considerably improved the limited-view PA image quality, reconstructing pressures with clear and accurate structures and deriving doses with a high agreement with the ground truth. Quantitatively, the pressure accuracy achieved an RMSE of 0.061, and the dose accuracy achieved an RMSE of 0.044, GI (3%/3 mm) of 93.71%, and 90%-isodose line dice of 0.922. The proposed method demonstrates the feasibility of achieving high-quality quantitative 3D dosimetry in PA imaging using a matrix array, which potentially enables the online 3D dose verification for prostate proton therapy.""","""['Zhuoran Jiang', 'Leshan Sun', 'Weiguang Yao', 'Q Jackie Wu', 'Liangzhong Xiang', 'Lei Ren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A feasibility study of enhanced prompt gamma imaging for range verification in proton therapy using deep learning.', 'Two-stage ionoacoustic range verification leveraging Monte Carlo and acoustic simulations to stably account for tissue inhomogeneity and accelerator-specific time structure - A simulation study.', 'Theoretical detection threshold of the proton-acoustic range verification technique.', 'Simulation of x-ray-induced acoustic imaging for absolute dosimetry: Accuracy of image reconstruction methods.', 'Ionizing radiation-induced acoustics for radiotherapy and diagnostic radiology applications.', 'Emerging technologies for cancer therapy using accelerated particles.']"""

Materials and methods:   We identified 9,249 potentially eligible PEH cared for at a large metropolitan hospital system from an institutional registry of all patients who presented to the health care system as homeless from 2014 to 2021. Homelessness was defined by the presence of the Z-code for homelessness (Z59), the listed address matching to the address of a homeless shelter or other transitional housing or a positive screen for homelessness.

Results:   A total of 1,605 PEH and 3,413 non-PEH were eligible for PSA screening within the study timeframe. Half of PEH were Black (50%). Medicaid was the most common insurance (51%), followed by Medicare (18%). PEH were less likely to have a PCP (58% v 81%, P < .001) and had a significantly lower PSA testing rate (13% v 34%, P < .001) compared with non-PEH. Univariate analysis revealed that PSA testing was more common in PEH who were employed (P < .001), had private insurance or Medicare (P < .001), or had an established primary care provider (PCP; P < .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed that having a PCP (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.62 to 4.00; P < .001) significantly increased the likelihood of PSA testing in PEH.

Objective:   The objective of this study is to explore the effect and underlying mechanism of SQS in the treatment of prostate cancer (PC).  Materials and methods:   PC cell lines (22Rv1 and PC-3) were treated with SQS (0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 ŒºM) for 12 or 24 h. The viability of cells was evaluated, while the mRNA and protein levels of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes in PC cell lines were measured (Groups: Control, TGF-Œ≤1, TNF-Œ±, TGF-Œ≤1 + TNF-Œ±, and TGF-Œ≤1 + TNF-Œ± + SQS). The migration and invasion abilities of PC cell lines were evaluated (Groups: Control, SQS). Finally, the antitumour effect of SQS (25, 50,100, and 200 mg/kg) in BALB/c nude mice (6 weeks, 18-20 g) was evaluated (Groups: Control, Vehicle, 25, 50,100, and 200 mg/kg SQS). The study duration was 1 month.  Results:   SQS inhibited the viability and the number of colonies of 22Rv1 or PC-3 cells. The IC50 of SQS of 12 and 24 h in these two cells was 3.25, 1.82, 4.76, and 4.70 ŒºM, respectively. SQS inhibited the adhesion, migration, and invasion of PC cells. It also inhibited the expression of EMT-related markers of PC cells. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Smad2/3 signalling pathways were activated in the process of EMT, and SQS could significantly reduce the activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Smad2/3 pathways. Finally, SQS inhibited the growth of xenograft tumours in vivo.

The GENCOV study aims to look at the relationship between genetic, serological, and biochemical factors and variability of SARS-CoV-2 symptom severity, and to evaluate the utility of returning genome screening results to study participants. Study participants select which results they wish to receive with a decision aid. Medically actionable information for diagnosis, disease risk estimation, disease prevention, and patient management are provided in a comprehensive genome report. Using a combination of bioinformatics software and custom tools, this article describes a pipeline for the analysis and reporting of genetic results to individuals with COVID-19, including HLA genotyping, large-scale continental ancestry estimation, and pharmacogenomic analysis to determine metabolizer status and drug response. In addition, this pipeline includes reporting of medically actionable conditions from comprehensive gene panels for Cardiology, Neurology, Metabolism, Hereditary Cancer, and Hereditary Kidney, and carrier screening for reproductive planning. Incorporated into the genome report are polygenic risk scores for six diseases-coronary artery disease; atrial fibrillation; type-2 diabetes; and breast, prostate, and colon cancer-as well as blood group genotyping analysis for ABO and Rh blood types and genotyping for other antigens of clinical relevance. The genome report summarizes the findings of these analyses in a way that extensively communicates clinically relevant results to patients and their physicians. ¬© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Materials and methods:   Data of 1,479 robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients between 2006-2021 reporting no financial toxicity in preoperative assessments were included retrospectively. Financial toxicity was measured with financial impact of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-quality of life questionnaire-C30. Financial impact scores were collected preoperatively, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.  Results:   The frequency of financial toxicity was 8.3% (122/1379; 95% CI 7.0-9.8) at any point in time throughout 2 years of follow-up. Patients reporting financial toxicity (63 [58-68]) were significantly younger than patients who had no financial toxicity (65 [61-69]; P = .001). There was no statistically significant difference between financial toxicity+ and financial toxicity- groups in terms of salvage radiotherapy (P = .8) and positive surgical margin (P = .2) rates. In functional assessments, clinically significant International Prostate Symptom Score and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form score increase of financial toxicity+ patients (34% and 62%) were more frequent than financial toxicity- patients (23% and 47%; P = .004 and P = .002, respectively). In multivariable analysis, age at robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, International Prostate Symptom Score, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form, and quality of life scores were associated with financial toxicity (P < .001, OR 0.95 [95% CI 0.92-0.98]; P = .015, OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.2-4.7]; P = .032, OR 1.5 [95% CI 1.2-2.5]; P = .01, OR 0.09 [95% CI 0.01-0.57], respectively). Patients who underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy before retirement (‚â§65 years) had a 1.6-fold increased financial toxicity risk (P = .003, 95% CI 1.1-2.3).  Conclusions:   Financial toxicity after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is low in mid-term follow-up. Patients who report urological symptoms after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy should also be evaluated for financial toxicity. Required measures against financial toxicity should be taken especially in the follow-up of younger cancer survivors.""","""['Oktay √ñzman', 'Corinne N Tillier', 'Erik van Muilekom', 'Lonneke V van de Poll-Franse', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'The preoperative pad test as a predictor of urinary incontinence and quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a prospective, observational, clinical study.', 'The EORTC quality of life questionnaire predicts early and long-term incontinence in patients treated with robotic assisted radical prostatectomy: Analysis of a large single center cohort.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Open Radical Prostatectomy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Dysfunction of cuproptosis induces cytotoxicity and influences the proliferation of multiple tumors. However, the direct prognostic effect of cuproptosis related genes and corresponding regulating mechanisms amid prostate cancer remains unknown. A multi-omics analysis strategy was adopted to explore the role of ten cuproptosis related genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas- Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD). Firstly, mRNA expression, Copy Number Variance (CNV), mutation, DNA methylation and prognostic power of the ten genes were illustrated. Based on transcriptomic data, we developed a novel prognostic model named the Cuproptosis-related gene score (CRGScore), Their biological functions were then detected by enrichment analysis and unsupervised cluster analysis. Following that, their correlation with Tumor Immune Microenvironment (TIME), immunotherapy, Biochemical Recurrence (BCR) and chemotherapeutic resistance were elaborated by relevant bioinformatics algorithms. Ten cuproptosis related genes exhibited extensive alteration of CNV and DNA methylation and showed significant influence on the prognosis of prostate cancer patients. These genes mainly enriched in E2F and G2M targets and mitosis pathways, Samples with high CRGScore showed enhancement resulting in the increased infiltration of T cell, B cell, NK cells. They also demonstrated close correlations with the BCR status, expression of eight immune checkpoints and chemotherapeutic resistances in prostate cancer. Our comprehensive analysis of CRGScore revealed an extensive regulatory mechanism by which they affect the tumor-immune-stromal microenvironment, clinicopathological features, and prognosis. We also determined the therapeutic liability of CRGScore in targeted therapy and immunotherapy. These findings highlight the crucial clinical implications of CRGScore and provide new ideas for guiding personalized immunotherapy strategies for patients with Pca.""","""['Liang Jin', 'Wangli Mei', 'Xiang Liu', 'Xianchao Sun', 'Shiyong Xin', 'Zhen Zhou', 'Jiaxin Zhang', 'Bihui Zhang', 'Ping Chen', 'Ming Cai', 'Lin Ye']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Identification of cuproptosis-related subtypes, construction of a prognosis model, and tumor microenvironment landscape in gastric cancer.', 'Cuproptosis illustrates tumor micro-environment features and predicts prostate cancer therapeutic sensitivity and prognosis.', 'Comprehensive analysis of cuproptosis-related genes and tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization in breast cancer.', 'Identification of a novel cuproptosis-related gene signature and integrative analyses in patients with lower-grade gliomas.', 'The implications and prospect of cuproptosis-related genes and copper transporters in cancer progression.', 'A novel model based on disulfidptosis-related genes to predict prognosis and therapy of bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'Cuproptosis: mechanisms and links with cancers.', 'Expression Profiles of Cuproptosis-Related Genes Determine Distinct Subtypes of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'Cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature for prognostic prediction in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.', 'Identification and validation of a novel cuproptosis-related lncRNA gene signature to predict prognosis and immune response in bladder cancer.']"""

After comparison of wild-type AZIN1 (wtAZIN1) and edited AZIN1 (edAZIN1, which contains a Ser367Gly substitution), we report differential binding of edAZIN1 to a small set of proteins; specifically, edAZIN1 binds to alpha-smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), gamma actin 1 (ACTG1), and myosin9, whereas wtAZIN1 does not. This binding enables nuclear translocation of edAZIN1. In contrast to overexpression of edAZIN1 and, to a lesser extent, (editable) wtAZIN1, overexpression of an uneditable AZIN1 allele does not promote a cellular phenotype associated with increased tumorigenicity. In patients, both editing and nuclear localization of AZIN1 are common and are associated with tumor aggressiveness, i.e., a higher Gleason score, higher genomic instability, and a shorter progression-free survival time.

Aim:   Our objective was to perform a qualitative study to identify unmet sexual needs of patients and female partners after PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   We conducted a qualitative study of posts to the Inspire Us TOO Prostate Cancer Online Support and Discussion Community. Overall, 6,193 posts were identified in the Sexual Health & Intimacy forum of the community, of which 661 posts were from female authors. A random sample of 10% (n = 66) of posts from female partners and an equal number of randomly selected posts from male patients were analyzed.  Outcomes:   We assessed sexual health themes among patients and female partners.  Results:   Multiple themes emerged that were unique to female partners of PCa survivors. These included expanding the sexual repertoire, feeling invisible, contextualizing sexual intimacy within the broader picture of survival, and addressing relationship concerns. Patients and their partners also shared common sexual health themes, including coming to terms with changes in sexual function and frustration with clinicians. Both patients and their partners use online health communities to get support and share their experiences with sexual recovery and use of sexual aids. Psychosocial treatments were infrequently mentioned, and may be particularly helpful to address partner concerns.  Clinical implications:   A common concern for couples was not receiving sufficient information from healthcare providers regarding sexual side effects from PCa and its treatment.  Strengths and limitations:   Strengths of the study include leveraging a unique data source to address an understudied topic of sexual health concerns among partners after PCa diagnosis. However, members of an online community may not be representative of all couples facing PCa. Also, this analysis is limited to female partners of patients with PCa, and further study is underway to examine the sexual health needs among gay and bisexual couples.  Conclusion:   Both patients and female partners have many unmet sexual health needs during PCa survivorship, and designing interventions to incorporate partner perspectives may improve the management of sexual side effects of PCa for couples.

This study aims to describe the contribution of GPR75, 20-HETE membrane receptor, in 20-HETE-mediated expression and transcriptional activity of AR in PCa. In LNCaP cells, 20-HETE increased AR expression, nuclear localization, and its transcriptional activity. Also, 20-HETE enhanced dihydrotestosterone (DHT) induced effects. All was abrogated by chemical antagonism of GPR75 (19-HEDE) or its transient knockdown. In human PCa, the expression of AR-driven genes correlated with GPR75. In LNCaP xenografts, tumors from castrated animals expressed higher levels of AR, this was impaired by inhibition of 20-HETE synthesis.

AroCell has developed a dual monoclonal antibody ELISA for determination of TK1 protein in clinical samples. The purpose of the study is to validate the ELISA analytically in relation to the gold standard, [3H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation assay for TK1 activity using sera from patients with different malignancies. The colorimetric TK 210 ELISA was validated analytically by assessment of precision, linearity, interfering substances, and stability. For the clinical validation, serum samples from patients with hematological malignancies (n = 100), breast cancer (n = 56), prostate cancer (n = 70) and blood donors (n = 159) were analyzed using TK 210 ELISA and TK1 activity by [3H]-deoxythymidine (dThd) phosphorylation assay. The sandwich TK 210 ELISA was highly specific for TK1 protein having a detection limit of 0.12 ng/mL, with a functional sensitivity of 0.25 ng/mL. Within-run CVs ranged from 5.5% to 10% and between-run CVs ranged from 5% to 15%. The ratio of observed to expected dilutional parallelism of 5 serum samples was in the range of 80-120%. Samples exhibited stability through four freeze/thaw cycles and 5 days at 4¬∞C. Further, the ROC curve analysis showed that TK 210 ELISA and [3H]-dThd phosphorylation assay had similar sensitivity (62% vs 59%) in hematological malignancies. However, in the case of breast and prostate cancer sera, TK 210 ELISA had higher sensitivity (59% and 44%) compared to [3H]-dThd phosphorylation assay (47% and 25%) at a specificity of 98%.

Recent studies have showed that peri-urethral tissue fibrosis is an untreated pathobiology contributing to LUTS. Fibrosis results from excessive extracellular matrix deposition which increases transition zone and peri-urethral tissue stiffness and compromises prostatic urethral flexibility and compliance, producing urinary obstructive symptoms. Inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and T-lymphocytes, secrete a medley of pro-fibrotic proteins into the prostatic microenvironment, including IFNŒ≥, TNFŒ±, CXC-type chemokines, and interleukins, all of which have been implicated in inflammation-mediated fibrosis. Among these, IL-4 and IL-13 are of particular interest because they share a common signaling axis that, as shown here for the first time, promotes the expression and maintenance of IL-4, IL-13, their cognate receptors, and ECM components by prostate fibroblasts, even in the absence of immune cells. Based on studies presented here, we hypothesize that the IL-4/IL-13 axis promotes prostate fibroblast activation to ECM-secreting cells.  Methods:   N1 or SFT1 immortalized prostate stromal fibroblasts were cultured and treated, short- or long-term, with pro-fibrotic proteins including IL-4, IL-13, TGF-Œ≤, TNF-Œ±, IFNŒ≥, with or without prior pre-treatment with antagonists or inhibitors. Protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, ELISA, immunoblot, or Sircoll assays. Transcript expression levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Intact cells were counted using WST assays.  Results:   IL-4RŒ±, IL-13RŒ±1, and collagen are concurrently up-regulated in human peri-urethral prostate tissues from men with LUTS. IL-4 and IL-13 induce their own expression as well as that of their cognate receptors, IL-4RŒ± and IL-13RŒ±1. Low concentrations of IL-4 or IL-13 act as cytokines to promote prostate fibroblast proliferation, but higher (>40ng/ml) concentrations repress cellular proliferation. Both IL-4 and IL-13 robustly and specifically promote collagen transcript and protein expression by prostate stromal fibroblasts in a JAK/STAT-dependent manner. Moreover, IL-4 and IL-13-mediated JAK/STAT signaling is coupled to activation of the IL-4RŒ± receptor.  Conclusions:   Taken together, these studies show that IL-4 and IL-13 signal through the IL-4RŒ± receptor to activate JAK/STAT signaling, thereby promoting their own expression, that of their cognate receptors, and collagens. These finding suggest that the IL-4/IL-13 signaling axis is a powerful, but therapeutically targetable, pro-fibrotic mechanism in the lower urinary tract.""","""[""Quentin D'Arcy"", 'Mehrnaz Gharaee-Kermani', 'Alisa Zhilin-Roth', 'Jill A Macoska']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['CXC-type chemokines promote myofibroblast phenoconversion and prostatic fibrosis.', 'Endogenously expressed IL-13RŒ±2 attenuates IL-13-mediated responses but does not activate signaling in human lung fibroblasts.', 'CXCL12/CXCR4 Axis Activation Mediates Prostate Myofibroblast Phenoconversion through Non-Canonical EGFR/MEK/ERK Signaling.', 'Chemokines and BPH/LUTS.', 'The role of prostate inflammation and fibrosis in lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'The Role of IL-13 and IL-4 in Adipose Tissue Fibrosis.', 'Current research and future directions in non-malignant urologic research - proceedings of the annual CAIRIBU meeting.']"""

Results:   A significant increase in maximum flow rate (MFR) and decreases in voided volume (VV) and post-void residual urine (PVR) were seen. In multivariate analysis, age was a negative predictor of MFR increase, while prostate volume was a positive predictor of PVR decrease and MFR increase. VV decrease led to worse incontinence symptoms, while PVR decrease and MFR increase led to improvement in voiding symptoms such as slow stream and straining. Continence recovery curves showed that VV decrease were associated with a delay in continence recovery.

Prostate-specific antigen-based screening can reduce prostate cancer-specific mortality, but there are concerns about overdiagnosis, overtreatment and economic value. The aim was therefore to assess the cost effectiveness of eight potential screening strategies in the UK.  Methods:   We used a cost-utility analysis with an individual-based simulation model. The model was calibrated to data from the 10-year follow-up of the Cluster Randomised Trial of PSA Testing for Prostate Cancer (CAP). Treatment effects were modelled using data from the Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment (ProtecT) trial. The participants were a hypothetical population of 10 million men in the UK followed from age 30 years to death. The strategies were: no screening; five age-based screening strategies; adaptive screening, where men with an initial prostate-specific antigen level of < 1.5 ng/mL are screened every 6 years and those above this level are screened every 4 years; and two polygenic risk-stratified screening strategies. We assumed the use of pre-biopsy multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging for men with prostate-specific antigen ‚â• 3 ng/mL and combined transrectal ultrasound-guided and targeted biopsies. The main outcome measures were projected lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years from a National Health Service perspective.  Results:   All screening strategies increased costs compared with no screening, with the majority also increasing quality-adjusted life-years. At willingness-to-pay thresholds of ¬£20,000 or ¬£30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, a once-off screening at age 50 years was optimal, although this was sensitive to the utility estimates used. Although the polygenic risk-stratified screening strategies were not on the cost-effectiveness frontier, there was evidence to suggest that they were less cost ineffective than the alternative age-based strategies.  Conclusions:   Of the prostate-specific antigen-based strategies compared, only a once-off screening at age 50 years was potentially cost effective at current UK willingness-to-pay thresholds. An additional follow-up of CAP to 15 years may reduce uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of the screening strategies.""","""['Edna Keeney', 'Sabina Sanghera#', 'Richard M Martin#', 'Roman Gulati', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Eleanor I Walsh', 'Jenny L Donovan', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'David E Neal', 'J Athene Lane', 'Emma L Turner#', 'Howard Thom#', 'Mark S Clements']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pharmacoeconomics""","""['Benefit, Harm, and Cost-effectiveness Associated With Magnetic Resonance Imaging Before Biopsy in Age-based and Risk-stratified Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Polygenic risk-tailored screening for prostate cancer: A benefit-harm and cost-effectiveness modelling study.', 'Cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: a simulation study based on ERSPC data.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

Recent findings suggest that physiological adaptations to acute exercise comprise potential anticancer effects, but these remain poorly explored in clinical settings. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of a single exercise bout on tumor oxygenation and immune cell infiltration in patients with prostate cancer. Thirty patients with localized prostate cancer were randomized (2:1) to either one high-intensity interval training bout or no exercise on the day before radical prostatectomy. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on prostatic tissue from surgery and assessed for tumor hypoxia, natural killer (NK) cell infiltration, and microvessel density (MVD). Acute systemic response in blood lymphocytes, epinephrine, norepinephrine, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor, cortisol, lactate, and glucose was also evaluated. We did not find between-group differences in tumor hypoxia (Mann-Whitney U test, U = 83.5, p = 0.604) or NK cell infiltration (U = 77.0, p = 0.328). Also, no significant correlation was found between MVD and tumor hypoxia or NK cell infiltration. One exercise bout is likely insufficient to modulate tumor hypoxia or NK cell infiltration. Future studies may elucidate if an accumulation of several exercise bouts can impact these outcomes (NCT03675529, www.clinicaltrials.gov).""","""['Sissal Sigmundsd√≥ttir Djurhuus', 'Tim Schauer', 'Casper Simonsen', 'Birgitte Gr√∏nkaer Toft', 'Adina Ruth Deborah Jensen', 'Janine Terra Erler', 'Martin Andreas R√∏der', 'Pernille Hojman', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Jesper Frank Christensen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Physiol Rep""","""['Exercise training to increase tumour natural killer-cell infiltration in men with localised prostate cancer: a randomised controlled trial.', 'The effects of acute exercise and inflammation on immune function in early-stage prostate cancer.', 'High Intensity Aerobic exercise training and Immune cell Mobilization in patients with lung cancer (HI AIM)-a randomized controlled trial.', 'Exercise training, circulating cytokine levels and immune function in cancer survivors: A meta-analysis.', 'Stress hormones and the immunological responses to heat and exercise.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Acute exercise induces distinct quantitative and phenotypical T cell profiles in men with prostate cancer.']"""

Aim:   To determine the clonal origin of heterogeneity in PCa and its association with disease progression, SPOP, ERG(+), EZH2, NKX3.1, and SPINK-1 subtypes were analyzed.  Methods:   A total of 103 samples from 20 PCa patients were analyzed; foci of adjacent non-tumor prostate tissue, HGPIN, GL3, GL4, GL5, and LN were examined to determine the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion and ERG, EZH2, NKX3.1, and SPINK-1 expression levels, using RT-PCR. Mutations in exons 6 and 7 of the SPOP gene were determined by sequencing. The presence of subtypes and molecular patterns were identified by combining all subtypes analyzed. To establish the clonal origin of multifocal PCa, molecular concordance between different foci of the same patient was determined. Association of these subtypes with histopathological groups and time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) was assessed.  Results:   No mutation was found in SPOP in any sample. The ERG(+) subtype was the most frequent. The molecular pattern containing all four PCa subtypes was only detected in 3 samples (4%), all LN, but it was the most frequent (40%) in patients. Molecular discordance was the predominant status (55%) when all analyzed molecular characteristics were considered. It was possible to find all subtypes, starting as a preneoplastic lesion, and all but one LN molecular subtype were ERG(+) and NKX3.1 subtypes. Only the expression of the NKX3.1 gene was significantly different among the histopathological groups. No association was found between BCR time in patients and molecular subtypes or molecular concordance or between clinicopathological characteristics and molecular subtypes of ERG, EZH2, and SPINK-1.  Conclusion:   The predominance of molecular discordance in prostatic foci per patient, which reflects the multifocal origin of PCa foci, highlights the importance of analyzing multiple samples to establish the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of molecular subtypes in a patient. All the subtypes analyzed here are of early onset, starting from preneoplastic lesions.

The purpose of this study was to assess intertumoral heterogeneity in terms of radio resistance using an ex-vivo Œ≥H2AX assay after irradiation of prostate biopsy cores and to investigate its correlation with clinical features of respective patients as well as imaging and genomic features of tumor areas.  Methods:   Twenty one patients with histologically-proven PCa and pre-therapeutic multiparametric resonance imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography were included in the study. Biopsy cores were collected from 26 PCa foci. Residual Œ≥H2AX foci were counted 24 h after ex-vivo irradiation (with 0 and 4 Gy) of biopsy specimen and served as a surrogate for radio resistance. Clinical, genomic (next generation sequencing) and imaging features were collected and their association with the radio resistance was studied.  Results:   In total 18 PCa lesions from 16 patients were included in the final analysis. The median Œ≥H2AX foci value per PCa lesion was 3.12. According to this, the patients were divided into two groups (radio sensitive vs. radio resistant) with significant differences in foci number (p < 0.0001). The patients in the radio sensitive group had significantly higher prostate specific antigen serum concentration (p = 0.015), tumor areas in the radio sensitive group had higher SUV (standardized uptake values in PSMA PET)-max and -mean values (p = 0.0037, p = 0.028) and lower ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient-mean values, p = 0.049). All later parameters had significant (p < 0.05) correlations in Pearson's test. One patient in the radio sensitive group displayed a previously not reported loss of function frameshift mutation in the NBN gene (c.654_658delAAAAC) that introduces a premature termination codon and results in a truncated protein.

However, these findings were uncertain because of survivor bias and a lack of stratification by cancer types. This current cohort study used data from the UK Biobank to explore these associations.  Methods:   Multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to examine the association of cancer status and the risk of dementia with its subtypes after adjusting for age and sex. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as a measure of relative risk by comparing observed dementia incidence among cancer patients.  Results:   We included 263,151 participants in the observational analysis. During a median follow-up of 9.18 years, dementia was diagnosed in 472 individuals with cancer and 3685 individuals without cancer, respectively. Cancer patients had lower risks of dementia (hazard ratio: 0.89, confidence interval: 0.81-0.98) and its subtypes (Alzheimer's disease [AD]: 0.85 [0.74-0.98]; vascular dementia [VD]: 0.81 [0.66-0.99]) in the Cox regression adjusted for age and sex. Individuals with cancers in the male genital system had substantially reduced risks of dementia (0.66 [0.46-0.93]) and AD (0.53 [0.29-0.97]) than those with cancers in other systems. Moreover, non-melanoma skin cancer and prostate cancer were associated with a reduced risk of dementia (0.79 [0.62-0.99]; 0.69 [0.49-0.97]), but not with AD or VD (P>0.05).

The objective of this study was to identify multilevel determinants of imaging for prostate cancer (PCa) and asymptomatic microhematuria (AMH), two common urologic conditions that have contributed substantially to the annual spending on unnecessary imaging in the US.  Methods:   We used a convergent mixed-methods approach involving survey and interview data. Using a survey, we asked 33 clinicians (55% response-rate) to indicate their imaging approach to 8 clinical vignettes designed to elicit responses that would demonstrate guideline-concordant/discordant imaging practices for patients with PCa or AMH. A subset of survey respondents (N = 7) participated in semi-structured interviews guided by a combination of two frameworks that offered a comprehensive understanding of multilevel determinants. We analyzed the interviews using a directed content analysis approach and identified subthemes to better understand the differences and similarities in the imaging determinants across two clinical conditions.  Results:   Survey results showed that the majority of clinicians chose guideline-concordant imaging behaviors for PCa; guideline-concordant imaging intentions were more varied for AMH. Interview results informed what influenced imaging decisions and provided additional context to the varying intentions for AMH. Five subthemes touching on multiple levels were identified from the interviews: National Guidelines, Supporting Evidence and Information Exchange, Organization of the Imaging Pathways, Patients' Clinical and Other Risk Factors, and Clinicians' Beliefs and Experiences Regarding Imaging. Imaging decisions for both PCa and AMH were often driven by national guidelines from major professional societies. However, when clinicians felt guidelines were inadequate, they reported that their decision-making was influenced by their knowledge of recent scientific evidence, past clinical experiences, and the anticipated benefits of imaging (or not imaging) to both the patient and the clinician. In particular, clinicians referred to patients' anxiety and uncertainty or patients' clinical factors. For AMH patients, clinicians additionally expressed concerns regarding legal liability risk.  Conclusion:   Our study identified comprehensive multilevel determinants of imaging to inform development of de-implementation interventions to reduce low-value imaging, which we found useful for identifying determinants of de-implementation.

Methods:   Tandem mass tag (TMT)-based proteomics and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis were used to screen the differential proteins and further validated in other independent studies (n = 539). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC), decision curves and nomograms were applied to assess the diagnostic accuracy of biomarkers.  Results:   Three candidate proteins (DBP, LCAT and ORM2) were preliminarily screened. Subsequent validation studies revealed significant upregulation of ORM2 in PCa patients across other independent cohorts. ORM2 yielded excellent discriminative power for PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients (AUC = 0.861 and 0.814 in validation phases 2a and 2b, respectively). Importantly, the combination of ORM2 and PSA gave better predictive accuracy than PSA alone. We incorporated age, PSA and ORM2 into a nomogram, which yielded C-index of 0.883 in validation phase 2a.

The development of androgen axis-targeted therapies such as abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide and darolutamide can prolong survival in mCPRC; however, resistance remains a barrier to prolonged response, necessitating exploration into resistance mechanisms and locoregional therapies. Here, we describe a patient with mCRPC that was progressing on abiraterone acetate. He was also found to have primary hyperaldosteronism from a functional adrenal adenoma, and thus he had a partial adrenalectomy to remove this tumour. Pathology confirmed an aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma. After his adrenalectomy, he had a sharp decline in both his PSA (prostate specific antigen) and testosterone levels, and he enjoyed a year-long period of remission after his adrenalectomy.

Results From a Medically Underserved Center""","""Background:   Disparities among patients with cancer are well documented. Recent studies suggest these disparities also affect patients undergoing metastatic spinal tumor surgery. However, it is unclear whether social factors are associated with ambulatory outcomes or overall survival.  Questions/purposes:   In patients undergoing metastatic spinal tumor surgery, (1) Are race, Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) score, or insurance status associated with a lower likelihood of postoperative ambulation? (2) Are race, SVI score, or insurance status associated with shorter overall survival?  Methods:   Between April 2012 and June 2021, we surgically treated 148 patients for metastatic cord compression or spinal mechanical instability because of cancer. Inclusion criteria were patients with complete demographic, social, oncologic, and follow-up data and patients who were followed until death or for at least 3 months postoperatively. Based on these criteria, 12% (18 of 148) were excluded because they had incomplete data and another 7% (11 of 148) were excluded because they were lost before the minimum study follow-up interval, leaving 80% (119) for analysis. Collected social data included self-reported race (White, Black, Hispanic or Latino, or other), SVI score, and primary insurance (Medicare, Medicaid, or private). The median age of the group was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] 53 to 70 years), and 58% of patients were men (69 of 119). The race distribution was 45% Black (54 of 119), 32% Hispanic or Latino (38 of 119), 16% White (19 of 119), and 7% other (eight of 119). The median SVI score was 89.8 (IQR 73.8 to 98.5), and 74% of patients (88) were categorized as having high vulnerability. The insurance distribution was as follows: Medicare: 43%, Medicaid: 36%, and private insurance: 21%. The primary outcome variable was complete inability to ambulate postoperatively and the secondary outcome was median overall survival. Exploratory data analysis, univariate and multivariate logistic regression, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed.  Results:   After controlling for race, SVI score, insurance status, primary cancer, and modified Bauer score, the only factor independently associated with postoperative nonambulation was preoperative nonambulatory status (odds ratio 59.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 13.2 to 266.1]; p < 0.001). After controlling for variables such as performance status, BMI, primary cancer, modified Bauer score, and insurance status, factors independently associated with survival included Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4 [95% CI 1.1 to 2.0]; p = 0.03), prostate cancer (HR 0.4 [95% CI 0.1 to 0.9]; p = 0.03), and hematologic cancer (HR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1 to 0.8]; p = 0.02). Race, SVI score, and insurance status were not associated with overall survival.  Conclusion:   In this study, we found no difference in ambulatory outcome for patients based on their race, SVI score, or insurance status. Likewise, no differences in postoperative survival were found. These findings suggest that despite differences in presentation or short-term outcome reported in other investigations, the social factors we explored were not associated with the likelihood of a patient being nonambulatory postoperatively or shorter survival after spinal tumor surgery. Research studies that analyze race as a covariate of interest should take care to explore metrics of socioeconomic deprivation (such as the SVI score) to avoid drawing misleading conclusions.

However, continued administration of AR antagonists often results in the development of resistance, known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Despite castration, it has been demonstrated that AR signalling continues to be fundamental to tumour growth. In this regard, a series of readily synthesizable 4,4-dimethylimidazolidine-2-one pharmacophore-based AR antagonists (FAR01-FAR11) were designed and synthesized. Androgen-dependent LNCaP PC cell line was used to test the AR-antagonist activity of these compounds in vitro and compared with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved second-generation enzalutamide. In our previous work, rigid thiohydantoin pharmacophore in enzalutamide is replaced by the flexible 4,4-dimethylimidazolidin-2-one. In order to improve the flexibility further, one methylene group is introduced between the pharmacophore and one of the aromatic ring.

Methods:   A cross-sectional study was performed using the population-based database BDCAP (Base de Datos Cl√≠nicos de Atenci√≥n Primaria, primary care clinical database) to analyze the relative risk of cancer in Spanish population with hypothyroidism.  Results:   In a total of 2,414,165 patients diagnosed with hypothyroidism in BDCAP in 2019, the relative risk (OR) of cancer, compared to the non-hypothyroid population, was 1.73 (1.72-1.74) (P<0.0001). The higher risk was observed in both men (OR 2.15 [2.13-2.17]; P<0.0001) and women (OR 1.67 [1.636-1.68]; P<0.0001). However, hypothyroid persons aged 65 years or older had a reduced risk of cancer (OR 0.98 [0.97-0.98]; P<0.0001). In addition, hypothyroid patients aged 65 or over showed a decreased risk of cancers of the bladder, colorectal, gastric, pancreatic and prostate. Socioeconomic characteristics such as income level, municipality size, country of birth and employment situation had limited influence on the association between hypothyroidism and cancer. However, hypothyroid patients receiving replacement therapy exhibited higher cancer risk compared with patients without treatment (OR 1.30 [1.28-1.31]; P<0.0001).  Conclusion:   Spanish hypothyroid patients of both genders have a risk of overall cancer higher than that found in non-hypothyroid population.

Hyperglycemia is an on-target effect of ipatasertib. An open-label, single-arm, single-sequence, signal-seeking study (n = 25 mCRPC patients) was conducted to evaluate the glucose changes across four different treatment periods: ipatasertib alone, ipatasertib-prednisone combination, ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination (morning dose), and ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination (evening dose). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was used in this study to compare the dynamic glucose changes across the different treatment periods. Four key parameters: average glucose, peak glucose and % time in range (70-180 and >180 mg/dl) were evaluated for this comparison. Ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination when administered in the morning after an overnight fast significantly increased average glucose, peak glucose and % time in range >180 mg/dl compared to ipatasertib monotherapy. Ipatasertib, when co-administered with abiraterone, increased ipatasertib and M1 (G-037720) metabolite exposures by approximately 1.5- and 2.2-fold, respectively. Exposure-response analysis results show that increased exposures of ipatasertib in combination with abiraterone are associated with increased glucose levels. When ipatasertib-prednisone-abiraterone combination was administered as an evening dose compared to a morning dose, lowered peak glucose and improved % time in range was observed.

As compared with the general population, male police officers had a 7% (95% CI: 4-9%) excess cancer risk, with elevated SIRs for various cancer sites, including prostate (SIR 1.19, 1.14-1.25), breast (SIR 1.77, 1.05-2.80), colon (SIR 1.22, 1.12-1.32) and skin melanoma (SIR 1.44, 1.28-1.60). Conversely, male police officers had a lower risk of lung cancer than the general population (SIR 0.72, 0.66-0.77). In female police officers, the SIR for cancer overall was 1.15 (0.98-1.34), and there was a slight excess of cancers of the breast (SIR 1.25, 0.97-1.59) and colon (SIR 1.21, 0.55-2.30). In conclusion, cancer incidence among the police officers was slightly higher than in the general population. Notably, SIRs were elevated for cancer sites potentially related to night shift work, namely colon, breast and prostate cancer.""","""['Sanna Heikkinen', 'Paul A Demers', 'Johnni Hansen', 'Jarle Jakobsen', 'Kristina Kjaerheim', 'Elsebeth Lynge', 'Jan Ivar Martinsen', 'Ingrid Sivesind Mehlum', 'Janne Pitk√§niemi', 'Jenny Selander', 'J√≥hanna Torfad√≥ttir', 'Elisabete Weiderpass', 'Eero Pukkala']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Occupation and cancer - follow-up of 15 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'Occupational variation in the risk of female breast cancer in the Nordic countries.', 'Occupation and cutaneous melanoma: a 45-year historical cohort study of 14¬∑9 million people in five Nordic countries.', 'Work-related cancer in the Nordic countries.', 'The epidemiology of cancer among police officers.']"""

We sought to determine the frequency of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning in patients commencing adjuvant ADT for treatment of high-risk prostate cancer at a large integrated regional cancer centre.  Material and methods:   The electronic medical records (EMR) of all patients with high-risk prostate carcinoma commenced on adjuvant ADT between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 at the Mid-North Coast Cancer Institute, Coffs Harbour, Australia were reviewed. Patients commenced on neoadjuvant ADT and long-term suppressive ADT for metastatic disease were excluded. The following data were obtained: socio-demographic information, prostate cancer data, ADT details and DXA results.  Results:   188 men (mean age ¬± SD, 75.4 ¬± 7 years) were commenced on adjuvant ADT for a total duration (mean ¬± SD) of 23.4 ¬± 7 months. Most (n = 155/188, 82%) were commenced on leuprorelin acetate. While only 26/188 (14%) had a DXA scan performed prior to ADT, another 133 (71%) had a DXA scan at a median of 20 days (interquartile range 7-98), later. Of the 159 men with DXA readings, 76 (48%) were osteopaenic and 38 (24%) were osteoporotic by DXA criteria.  Conclusion:   A high level (85%) of DXA scanning in men commencing ADT for prostate cancer can be achieved at a regional centre. The high prevalence (72%) of low bone mass in our unselected cohort underscores the importance of routine DXA scanning to guide bone health management during ADT.""","""['Belinda Pan', 'Noel J Aherne', 'Thomas P Shakespeare', 'Mathis Grossmann', 'Peter K K Wong']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Rep Pract Oncol Radiother""","""['Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry assessment of bone health in Australian men with prostate cancer commencing androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Association of Bone Mineral Density Testing With Risk of Major Osteoporotic Fractures Among Older Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Treat Localized or Regional Prostate Cancer.', 'Osteoporosis and prostate cancer: a cross-sectional study of Danish men with prostate cancer before androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.', 'The clinical importance of quantifying body fat distribution during androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Although it is known to cause cumulative dose-related cardiotoxicity, the underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood. This study aims to compare the cardiotoxicity of MTX and its' pharmacologically active metabolite naphthoquinoxaline (NAPHT) in an in vitro cardiac model, human-differentiated AC16 cells, and determine the role of metabolism in the cardiotoxic effects. Concentration-dependent cytotoxicity was observed after MTX exposure, affecting mitochondrial function and lysosome uptake. On the other hand, the metabolite NAPHT only caused concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in the MTT reduction assay. When assessing the effect of different inhibitors/inducers of metabolism, it was observed that metyrapone (a cytochrome P450 inhibitor) and phenobarbital (a cytochrome P450 inducer) slightly increased MTX cytotoxicity, while 1-aminobenzotriazole (a suicide cytochrome P450 inhibitor) decreased fairly the MTX-triggered cytotoxicity in differentiated AC16 cells. When focusing in autophagy, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine exacerbated the cytotoxicity caused by MTX and NAPHT, while the autophagy blocker, chloroquine, partially reduced the cytotoxicity of MTX. In addition, we observed a decrease in p62, beclin-1, and ATG5 levels and an increase in LC3-II levels in MTX-incubated cells. In conclusion, in our in vitro model, neither metabolism nor exogenously given NAPHT are major contributors to MTX toxicity as seen by the residual influence of metabolism modulators used on the observed cytotoxicity and by NAPHT's low cytotoxicity profile. Conversely, autophagy is involved in MTX-induced cytotoxicity and MTX seems to act as an autophagy inducer, possibly through p62/LC3-II involvement.""","""['Ana Reis-Mendes', 'F√©lix Carvalho', 'Fernando Remi√£o', 'Em√≠lia Sousa', 'Maria de Lourdes Bastos', 'Vera Marisa Costa']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Arch Toxicol""","""['Naphthoquinoxaline metabolite of mitoxantrone is less cardiotoxic than the parent compound and it can be a more cardiosafe drug in anticancer therapy.', 'The metabolic profile of mitoxantrone and its relation with mitoxantrone-induced cardiotoxicity.', 'Mitoxantrone impairs proteasome activity and prompts early energetic and proteomic changes in HL-1 cardiomyocytes at clinically relevant concentrations.', 'Pathways of cardiac toxicity: comparison between chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and mitoxantrone.', 'Mitoxantrone: a review of its use in multiple sclerosis.', 'Cardiac Molecular Remodeling by Anticancer Drugs: Doxorubicin Affects More Metabolism While Mitoxantrone Impacts More Autophagy in Adult CD-1 Male Mice.']"""

Neoadjuvant systemic therapy before definitive local therapy may improve oncological outcomes by targeting the primary tumor and micrometastatic disease.  Objective:   To evaluate whether a lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand (LuPSMA) can be safely administered to patients with HRLPC before robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to describe immediate oncological outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was an open-label, single-arm clinical trial. Patients with HRLPC and elevated radioligand uptake on PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography were enrolled. Two or three LuPSMA radioligand doses (7.4 GBq) were given at 2-wk intervals. RARP with lymph node dissection was performed 4 wk after the last LuPSMA dose.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The rate of surgical complications, operative parameters, changes in functional and quality-of-life measures, and immediate oncological outcomes (histological findings and biochemical response) were measured. Data were analyzed descriptively.  Results and limitations:   Fourteen patients participated (median age 67 yr). Prostate-specific antigen decreased by 17% (interquartile range [IQR] 9-50%) after two LuPSMA doses and 34% (IQR 11-60%) after three doses. Thirteen patients underwent RARP with no identifiable anatomical changes or intraoperative complications. Four patients (30%) had postoperative complications (pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, urinary leak with urinary tract infection). At 3 mo postoperatively, 12 patients (92%) required one pad or less. Final whole-mount pathology showed positive surgical margins (PSMs) in seven patients (53%) and downgrading to International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 3 in three patients (23%). Treatment-related effects included a clear vacuolated cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei.  Conclusions:   LuPSMA followed by RARP appears to be surgically safe. While oncological outcomes are pending, continence recovery seems to be unaffected by LuPSMA treatment.

The present study evaluated the COVID-19 pandemic impact on radiotherapy activity in Brazil.  Methods:   A national-level study was performed to evaluate the RT utilization for prostate, breast, head & neck (HN), Gynecology (GYN), Gastrointestinal (GI), lung cancers, and bone/brain metastases. The data on the RT executed was extracted from the Brazilian Ministry of Health database. The NON-COVID period was considered the control group, and the comparison groups were COVID-2020 (without vaccine) and COVID-2021 (with vaccine).  Results:   We collected the data of 238,355 procedures executed on three periods. Significant difference in the RT utilization between NON-COVID and COVID-2020 were observed for prostate cancer, bone and brain metastases (-12.3 %, p = 0.02, +24 %, p = 0.02 and +14 %, p = 0.04, respectively). Comparing 2 equivalents months from NON-COVID-2019 (ref), COVID-2020, and COVID-2021, a significant increase was identified for bone and brain metastases (2020 +21 %, and 2021 +32 %), and (2020 +20 %, and 2021 +14 %). A stable drop occurred for prostate cancer (2020 -11 % and 2021 -10 %), and a variation was observed for breast (2020 +8 %, and 2021 -1 %) and lung cancer (2020 +10 %, and 2021 -3 %). For other cancers, non-significant changes were observed when comparing 2020 and 2021.  Conclusion:   The RT activity was heterogeneously affected with a substantial increase for bone and brain metastases and a meaningful decline for prostate cancer.  Policy summary:   With a significant increase in the use of palliative radiotherapy for bone and brain metastases and a meaningful reduction in curative radiotherapy for prostate cancer, we hope these findings can help governments, RT services, medical communities, and other stakeholders develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the present and future pandemics.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recognize prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT for use in initial staging of high-risk primary prostate cancer. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) is a neuropeptide receptor overexpressed by low-risk prostate cancer cells. We aimed to perform the first (to our knowledge) prospective head-to-head comparison of PSMA- and GRP-R-targeted imaging at initial staging to understand how PSMA PET and GRP-R PET can be used or combined in clinical practice. Methods: This was a prospective, single-center, diagnostic cross-sectional imaging study using anonymized, masked, and independent interpretations of paired PET/CT studies in 22 patients with 68Ga-PSMA-617 (a radiolabeled PSMA inhibitor) and 68Ga-RM2 (68Ga-DOTA-4-amino-1-carboxymethylpiperidine-d-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2, a radiolabeled GRP-R antagonist). We enrolled patients with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven prostate cancer. None had received neoadjuvant hormone therapy or chemotherapy, and all underwent extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Histologic findings served as a reference. Results: On a lesion-based analysis (including lesions < 0.1 cm3), 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT detected 74.3% (26/35) of all tumor lesions and 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT detected 78.1% (25/32; 1 patient could not be offered 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT). Paired examinations showed positive uptake of the 2 tracers in 21 of 32 lesions (65.6%), negative uptake in 5 of 32 lesions (15.6%), and discordant uptake in 6 of 32 lesions (18.8%). Uptake of 68Ga-PSMA-617 was higher when the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) score was at least 4 versus at least 1 (P < 0.0001) or 2 (P = 0.0002). There were no significant differences in uptake between ISUP scores for 68Ga-RM2. Median 68Ga-RM2 SUVmax was significantly higher than median 68Ga-PSMA-617 SUVmax in the ISUP-2 subgroup (P = 0.01). Conclusion: 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT is useful to depict higher, more clinically significant ISUP score lesions, and 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT has a higher detection rate for low-ISUP tumors.

Methods: One hundred twenty-seven men with progressive mCRPC previously treated with androgen-signaling inhibition (99%) and chemotherapy (71%) received a median of 3 (interquartile range [IQR], 2-5) 8-GBq (IQR, 8-8.5 GBq) doses of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T. Imaging included 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (SUVmax > 15 at a single site and > 10 at all sites > 2 cm), diagnostic CT, and 177Lu SPECT/CT from vertex to mid thigh (24 h after treatment). 177Lu SPECT/CT quantitative analysis was undertaken at cycles 1 (baseline) and 2 (week 6) of treatment. Clinical and biochemical results were assessed to evaluate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: A PSA reduction of more than 50% was seen in 58% (74/127). The median PSA PFS was 6.1 mo (95% CI, 5.5-6.7), and OS was 16.8 mo (95% CI, 13.5-20.1). At the time of analysis, 41% (52/127) were deceased. At baseline and week 6, 76% (96/127) had analyzable serial 177Lu SPECT/CT imaging. SPECT total tumor volume (TTV) was reduced between baseline and week 6 in 74% (71/96; median, -193; IQR, -486 to -41). Any increase in SPECT TTV between baseline and week 6 was associated with significantly shorter PSA PFS (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2; P = 0.0008) but not OS. Median PSA PFS in those with an increase in SPECT TTV was 3.7 mo (95% CI, 2.8-6.8), compared with 6.7 mo (95% CI, 5.8-10.6) in those with no increase in SPECT TTV. An increase in SPECT TTV greater than 20% was also associated with PSA PFS (hazard ratio, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0; P = 0.008) but less significantly than any change in SPECT TTV. There was a significant difference in PSA PFS between patients with both increased PSA and SPECT TTV and patients with reduced SPECT TTV and PSA (median, 2.8 vs. 9.0 mo; P < 0.0001).

When exposed to low doses of X-ray radiation, AO increases the production of reactive radicals (radiodynamic therapy (AO-RDT)). We elucidated the efficacy of AO-RDT in breast and prostate cancer cell lines, which are likely to develop bone metastases.  Methods:   We used the mouse osteosarcoma cell line LM8, the human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, and the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Cultured cells were exposed to AO and radiation at various concentrations followed by various doses of irradiation. The cell viability was then measured. In vivo, each cell was inoculated subcutaneously into the backs of mice. In the AO-RDT group, AO (1.0 Œºg) was locally administered subcutaneously around the tumour followed by 5 Gy of irradiation. In the radiation group, 5 Gy of irradiation alone was administered after macroscopic tumour formation. The mice were killed on the 14th day after treatment. The change in tumour volume by AO-RDT was primarily evaluated.  Results:   The viability of LM8, MDA-MB-231, and PC-3 cells strongly decreased at AO concentration of 1.0 Œºg/ml and a radiation dose of 5 Gy. In xenograft mouse model, the AO-RDT also showed a strong cytocidal effect on tumour at the backside in osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. AO-RDT treatment was more effective for tumour control than radiotherapy in breast cancer.  Conclusion:   AO-RDT was effective in preventing the proliferation of osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. The reduction in tumour volume by AO-RDT was also confirmed in vivo.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2022;11(10):685-692.""","""['Yumi Matsuyama', 'Tomoki Nakamura', 'Keisuke Yoshida', 'Tomohito Hagi', 'Takahiro Iino', 'Kunihiro Asanuma', 'Akihiro Sudo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bone Joint Res""","""['Radiodynamic Therapy with Acridine Orange Is an Effective Treatment for Bone Metastases.', 'Methylene blue in place of acridine orange as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy of osteosarcoma.', 'Review.

Objective:   A series of new sulfonamide drugs are synthesized by reacting aldehydes thio-semi-carbazones derivatives with benzene sulphonyl chloride to form benzylidene-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide derivatives. Studying the anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines and the antioxidant activities of these newly synthesized compounds.  Methods:   Studying the anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines and the antioxidant activities of these newly synthesized compounds. To study the anti-breast cancer activity of the newly synthesized compounds, a molecular docking study is used to analyze the binding energy for the nonbonding interactions between the ligands (studied compounds) and receptor (4PYP (pdb code: 4FA2)) against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. The bioavailability of all studied compounds is confirmed by pharmacological investigations using Mol inspiration and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity online servers.  Results:   The two derivatives, 2-(4- methoxy benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4c) and 2-(4-dimethylamino) benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4e) show the most potent anticancer effects against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines. Meanwhile, these two derivatives show the lowest antioxidant activities.  Conclusion:   The different spectral techniques were used to confirm the structure of the novel synthesized compounds. Further, 2-(4-(dimethyl amino) benzylidene)-N- (phenylsulfonyl)hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4e) and 2-(4- methoxy benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1 carbothioamide (4c) were the most potent anticancer derivatives against MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, they exhibited the most potent antioxidant activities. Meanwhile, the 2-benzylidene-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4a) and 2-(4-chloro benzylidene)-N-(phenylsulfonyl) hydrazine-1-carbothioamide (4d) had the lowest antioxidant potentials. The estimated binding energies, inhibition constant, intermolecular energies, and reference RMSD produced from docking for all studied compounds were reported. These values showed that all studied compounds formed stable complexes with the receptor with high binding affinity. It was further noted from the ADMET analysis that compounds 4c, 4d, and 4e have good absorption, low toxicity in the human liver, and medium BBB penetration. Hence, these studied compounds (4c-4e) may be suggested as potential compounds against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.""","""['Hussein S Mohamed', 'Mohamed A Abdelgawad', 'Momtaz Hegab', 'Zeinab S Hamza', 'Amany M Nagdy', 'Sayed A Ahmed', 'Osama M Ahmed', 'Mohammed M Ghoneim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Curr Org Synth""","""['Molecular Dynamics and Biological Evaluation of 2-chloro-7-cyclopentyl- 7H-pyrrolo2,3-dpyrimidine Derivatives Against Breast Cancer.', 'Dexibuprofen amide derivatives as potential anticancer agents: synthesis, in silico docking, bioevaluation, and molecular dynamic simulation.', 'Design, synthesis, molecular docking, in silico ADMET profile and anticancer evaluations of sulfonamide endowed with hydrazone-coupled derivatives as VEGFR-2 inhibitors.', 'Camphor and Menthol as Anticancer Agents: Synthesis, Structure-Activity Relationship and Interaction with Cancer Cell Lines.', 'A review of synthetic strategy, SAR, docking, simulation studies, and mechanism of action of isoxazole derivatives as anticancer agents.']"""

Although mounting evidence supports a vital role for FDX1 in tumorigenesis of some cancers, no pan-cancer analysis of FDX1 has been reported. Therefore, we aimed to explore the prognostic value of FDX1 in pan-cancer and investigate its potential immune function. Based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Genotype Tissue-Expression, Human Protein Atlas, and Gene Set Cancer Analysis, we used a range of bioinformatics approaches to explore the potential carcinogenic role of FDX1, including analyzing the relationship between FDX1 expression and prognosis, DNA methylation, RNA methylation-related genes, mismatch repair (MMR) gene, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor microenvironment (TME), immune-related genes, and drug sensitivity in different tumors. The results show that FDX1 was lowly expressed in most cancers but higher in glioblastoma multiforme, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma. Moreover, FDX1 expression was positively or negatively associated with prognosis in different cancers. FDX1 expression was significantly associated with DNA methylation in 6 cancers, while there was a correlation between FDX1 expression and RNA methylation-related genes and MMR gene in most cancers. Furthermore, FDX1 expression was significantly associated with MSI in 8 cancers and TMB in 10 cancers. In addition, FDX1 expression was also significantly correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune-related genes, TME, and drug resistance in various cancers. An experiment in vitro showed FDX1 is downregulated by elesclomol, resulting in inhibiting cell viability of bladder cancer, clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and prostate cancer cells. Our study reveals that FDX1 can serve as a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker for various malignancies due to its vital role in tumorigenesis and tumor immunity.""","""['Longfei Yang', 'Yuwei Zhang', 'Yang Wang', 'Peng Jiang', 'Fengping Liu', 'Ninghan Feng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Pan-cancer integrated bioinformatics analysis reveals cuproptosis related gene FDX1 is a potential prognostic and immunotherapeutic biomarker for lower-grade gliomas.', 'Multi-omics pan-cancer study of cuproptosis core gene FDX1 and its role in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma.', 'Characterization of the functional effects of ferredoxin 1 as a cuproptosis biomarker in cancer.', 'A Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals the Prognostic and Immunotherapeutic Value of Stanniocalcin-2 (STC2).', 'Cuproptosis, the novel therapeutic mechanism for heart failure: a narrative review.', 'Cuproptosis-a potential target for the treatment of osteoporosis.', 'Prognostic and immunological role of FDX1 in pan-cancer: an in-silico analysis.', 'Regulatory roles of copper metabolism and cuproptosis in human cancers.', 'Cuproptosis: mechanisms and links with cancers.', 'Cuproptosis-Related MiR-21-5p/FDX1 Axis in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma and Its Potential Impact on Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

Previous studies showed a benefit of different therapies, including immune-based therapy, for Black men with metastatic prostate cancer. We sought to explore the efficacy of the PD-L1 inhibitor avelumab in Black men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) progressing after abiraterone or enzalutamide.  Methods:   This pilot phase II study enrolled self-identified Black patients who developed mCRPC on next-generation hormonal therapies (NHTs) abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (NCT03770455). Enrolled patients received avelumab 10mg/kg IV every 2 weeks while remaining on the same NHTs. The primary endpoint of our study was ‚â• 50% reduction in prostate specific antigen (PSA) at ‚â•8 weeks.  Results:   A total of eight patients were enrolled. The median duration on NHTs prior to enrollment was 364 days (95% CI, 260.9-467.1). The median time to initiate avelumab was 8 days (3-14). With a median follow-up of 196 days, no patients achieved the primary endpoint. The median time to PSA progression was 35 days (95 CI%, 0-94.8) and the median time to radiographic and/or clinical progression was 44 days (95 CI%, 0-118.5). The study was closed prematurely due to safety concerns related to the rapid clinical progression observed in the patients enrolled on study.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, the addition of avelumab to NHT did not demonstrate clinical activity in Black men with new mCRPC.

We aimed to test these models in a set of 1062 low-risk and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients diagnosed by multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and MRI-targeted biopsy. We hypothesized that the inclusion of radiological features into a novel model would improve patient selection. Performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Available models were characterized by poor discrimination (areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUCs] of 59% and 60%), underestimation of predicted risk on calibration plots, and a small amount of net benefit against a probability threshold of 40-50% at the DCA. The development of a novel model slightly improved discrimination (AUC of 63% vs 59%, p = 0.001, and 63% vs 60%, p = 0.07) and net benefit against threshold probabilities of ‚â•30%. This first multicenter study demonstrated the poor performance of models predicting adverse pathology and that implementation of MRI and MRI-targeted biopsy in this setting was not associated with a clear improvement in patient selection. Patients harboring low-risk or favorable intermediate-risk PCa and candidates for RP cannot be referred accurately to an AS program without a non-negligible risk of misclassification.

However, PCa is resistant to multi-kinase inhibitors-based anti-angiogenic therapies, and the mechanism and effective targeting thereof remains unclear. In this study, single-cell and bulk-transcriptomic datasets analysis revealed that KIAA1199, a hyaluronic acid (HA) binding protein, was involved in glycolysis, hypoxia and angiogenesis pathways. Moreover, boosted KIAA1199 expression in PCa tissues was positively correlated with tumor stage, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1Œ± overexpression, as well as angiogenesis markers. Tube formation, Western blot, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and in vivo tumorigenesis results demonstrated that KIAA1199 silencing significantly inhibited angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM), both in vitro and in vivo, by increasing semaphoring 3A (sema3A) expression while decreasing expressions of VEGFA, VE-cadherin, phosphorylated EphA2, and depolymerized HA levels. KIAA1199 overexpression was also found to promote angiogenesis and VM via increasing secretory VEGFA, however, this activity could be reversed by the HA biosynthesis inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU). Furthermore, dual-luciferase and ChIP-PCR revealed that HIF1Œ± is the transcriptional enhancer of KIAA1199, while lactate imported to PCa cells by monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) stabilizes HIF1Œ± under normoxia via HIF1Œ± lactylation.

While the molecular underpinnings and down-stream effects of these intercellular communications in excitable cells have been well appreciated, little is known about whether and how non-excitable cancer cells spontaneously initiate and transmit long-distance intercellular signals. Here we report that non-excitable human colon and prostate cancer cells spontaneously initiate and spread intercellular calcium waves, in vitro and ex vivo. Xenograft model studies suggest that these calcium signals promote the growth rate of tumors in mice. Pharmacological studies elucidated that the inositol-trisphosphate-receptor (IP3R)-regulated calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is activated by the Gq-PLC-IP3R pathway, is a major cause for the initiation of spontaneous calcium transients. Further, the spatial-temporal characteristics of calcium dynamics can be tuned by the culture substrates of different mechanical stiffnesses.

Methods:   806 patients with nmCRPC randomized to apalutamide in SPARTAN and treated with apalutamide in addition to ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were included in this post-hoc analysis investigating clinical variables associated with a subsequent fall. Time to a fall was assessed with Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for baseline characteristics and time-varying factors. Statistical inference was based on final multivariable models.  Results:   Falls were reported for 125/803 (15.6%) patients treated with apalutamide and ADT. Most falls were grade 1 or 2 and did not require hospitalization.

Targeting the TME using colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibition is a promising therapy for CRPC. However, the therapeutic response to sustained CSF1R inhibition (CSF1Ri) is limited as a monotherapy. We hypothesized that one of the underlying causes for the reduced efficacy of CSF1Ri and increased oxidation in CRPC is the upregulation and uncoupling of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3). Here we show that in high-grade PCa human specimens, NOS3 abundance positively correlates with CSF1-CSF1R signaling and remains uncoupled. The uncoupling diminishes NOS3 generation of sufficient nitric oxide (NO) required for S-nitrosylation of CSF1R at specific cysteine sites (Cys 224, Cys 278, and Cys 830). Exogenous S-nitrosothiol administration (with S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO)) induces S-nitrosylation of CSF1R and rescues the excess oxidation in tumor regions, in turn suppressing the tumor-promoting cytokines which are ineffectively suppressed by CSF1R blockade. Together these results suggest that NO administration could act as an effective combinatorial partner with CSF1R blockade against CRPC. In this context, we further show that exogenous NO treatment with GSNOR successfully augments the anti-tumor ability of CSF1Ri to effectively reduce the overall tumor burden, decreases the intratumoral percentage of anti-inflammatory macrophages, myeloid-derived progenitor cells and increases the percentage of pro-inflammatory macrophages, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and effector T cells, respectively. Together, these findings support the concept that the NO-CSF1Ri combination has the potential to act as a therapeutic agent that restores control over TME, which in turn could improve the outcomes of PCa patients.""","""['Fakiha Firdaus#', 'Manish Kuchakulla#', 'Rehana Qureshi#', 'Raul Ariel Dulce', 'Yash Soni', 'Derek J Van Booven', 'Khushi Shah', 'Thomas Masterson', 'Omar Joel Rosete', 'Sanoj Punnen', 'Joshua M Hare', 'Ranjith Ramasamy', 'Himanshu Arora']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Targeting the CSF1/CSF1R axis is a potential treatment strategy for malignant meningiomas.', 'CSF1/CSF1R Signaling Inhibitor Pexidartinib (PLX3397) Reprograms Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Stimulates T-cell Infiltration in the Sarcoma Microenvironment.', 'Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitors in cancer therapy.', 'Alterations of tumor microenvironment by nitric oxide impedes castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.', 'CSF1R inhibitors are emerging immunotherapeutic drugs for cancer treatment.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.']"""

Since the beginning of the 20th century, the Haifa bay area (HBA) has a major IC area with petrochemical industry complex and many other industries. The objectives of the current study were to estimate the association between IC residence and cancer incidence and to evaluate the effect of the residence duration.  Methods:   This study is a registry-based cohort (N = 1,022,637) with a follow-up of 21 years. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations (hazards ratios (HR) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) between HBA residence and incidence of all cancer sites (n = 62,049) and for site-specific cancer types including: lung cancer (n = 5398), bladder cancer (n = 3790), breast cancer (n = 11,310), prostate cancer (n = 6389) skin cancer (n = 4651), pancreatic cancer (n = 2144) and colorectal cancer (n = 8675). We evaluated the effect of the duration of exposure as categories of 7 years for those with 15 years of follow-up.  Results:   IC residence was associated with higher risk for all cancer sites (HR:1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12), for site-specific cancer incidence including: lung cancer (HR:1.14, 95% CI: 1.04-1.23), bladder cancer (HR:1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.23), breast cancer (HR:1.04, 95% CI: 0.98-1.10), prostate cancer (HR:1.07, 95% CI: 0.99-1.16), skin cancer (HR:1.22, 95% CI: 1.12-1.33) and colorectal cancer (HR:1.10, 95%CI: 1.03-1.17). Similar risk was also observed among young adults (HR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00-1.20).

Beyond tumor profiling, ctDNA analysis also can enable calculation of circulating tumor fraction (TF), which has previously been found to be prognostic. While most prognostic models in metastatic cancer are tumor type specific and require significant patient-level data, quantification of TF in ctDNA has the potential to serve as a pragmatic, tumor-agnostic prognostic tool.  Patients and methods:   This study utilized a cohort of patients in a nationwide de-identified clinico-genomic database with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), metastatic breast cancer (mBC), advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), or metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) undergoing liquid biopsy testing as part of routine care. TF was calculated based on single-nucleotide polymorphism aneuploidy across the genome. Clinical, disease, laboratory, and treatment data were captured from the electronic health record. Overall survival (OS) was evaluated by TF level while controlling for relevant covariables.  Results:   A total of 1725 patients were included: 198 mCRPC, 402 mBC, 902 aNSCLC, and 223 mCRC. TF ‚â•10% was highly correlated with OS in univariable analyses for all cancer types: mCRPC [hazard ratio (HR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.04-5.34, P < 0.001], mBC (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.71-3.37, P < 0.001), aNSCLC (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.34-2.1, P < 0.001), and mCRC (HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.39-3.2, P < 0.001). Multivariable assessments of TF had similar point estimates and CIs, suggesting a consistent and independent association with survival. Exploratory analysis showed that TF remained consistently prognostic across a wide range of cutpoints.  Conclusions:   Plasma ctDNA TF is a pragmatic, independent prognostic biomarker across four advanced cancers with potential to guide clinical conversations around expected treatment outcomes.

Currently, transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TPPB) is one of the most commonly used measures to help diagnose prostate cancer. However, whether the retention of catheterization before transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy is associated with the reduced risk of urethrorrhagia remains uncertain.  Methods:   A cohort study was conducted in our hospital from January 2021 to September 2021. This study included 93 patients who participated in transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy. We compared the risk of urethrorrhagia in patients who underwent indwelling catheterization before biopsy and those who did that after biopsy, and performed an unadjusted analysis. We also analyzed the use of related confounding factors to limit the cohort of men, and applied propensity-score adjustment to control potential confounders. Analyses that restricted the cohort men with the related confounding factors and that used propensity-score adjustment to control for potential confounders.  Results:   A total of 93 men were recruited in the cohort study, and the numbers of patients in group 1 and group 2 were 64 and 29, respectively. There were 34 patients (53.1%) of urethrorrhagia in group 1, and 22 patients (75.8%) of urethrorrhagia in group 2. This was a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .008). After adjusting for correlative factors, the preoperative catheterization is still a protective factor for postoperative urethrorrhagia through multivariate multiple piecewise linear regression analysis.  Conclusion:   The result of this cohort study suggested that preoperative catheterization can significantly reduce the risk of urethrorrhagia.""","""['He-Qian Liu', 'Wei Ding', 'Ling-Song Tao', 'Xu-Dong Shen', 'Jia-Wei Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urology""","""['A Single Center Evaluation of the Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging against Transperineal Prostate Mapping Biopsy: An Analysis of Men with Benign Histology and Insignificant Cancer following Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy.', 'Critical evaluation of magnetic resonance imaging targeted, transrectal ultrasound guided transperineal fusion biopsy for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Risk factors for infection complications after transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal prostate biopsy.', 'Recent Advances and Current Role of Transperineal Prostate Biopsy.', 'Complications After Systematic, Random, and Image-guided Prostate Biopsy.']"""

Although recent studies deemed that PCa tends to rely on lipid fuel in comparison with aerobic glycolysis, the relationship between lipid metabolism and cancer growth remains unknown. We demonstrated that wogonin, a naturally occurring mono-flavonoid, could induce apoptosis of PCa cells in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, 100 ŒºM wogonin significantly increased the expression of proteins related to the fatty acid synthesis and accumulation as a result of stimulation of AKT phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). The wogonin-induced up-regulation of fatty acid synthase (FASN) promoted fatty acid synthesis and storage, while increased oxidation in mitochondria driven by carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1A (CPT1A) resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, ultimately inducing apoptosis in DU145 and 22Rv1 cells. In vivo, 100 mg/kg of wogonin (i.v.) significantly repressed tumor growth without any obvious toxicity in the PCa xenograft model. In short, we proved that wogonin regulated the fatty acid metabolism and induced apoptosis by activating the AKT-SREBP1-FASN signaling network in human PCa cells, and it exhibited potent anti-tumor effects both in vivo and vitro. Thus it might be a promising candidate for the development of anti-cancer drugs.""","""['Yuening Sun', 'Wenjing Guo', 'Yongjian Guo', 'Zhangxing Lin', 'Dechao Wang', 'Qinglong Guo', 'Yuxin Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Food Chem Toxicol""","""['Docosahexaenoic acid reduces sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 and fatty acid synthase expression and inhibits cell proliferation by inhibiting pAkt signaling in a human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line.', 'BNIP3 induction by hypoxia stimulates FASN-dependent free fatty acid production enhancing therapeutic potential of umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells.', 'CD147 reprograms fatty acid metabolism in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through Akt/mTOR/SREBP1c and P38/PPARŒ± pathways.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Alteration of Lipid Metabolism in Prostate Cancer: Multifaceted Oncologic Implications.']"""

In such applications, analysts may be faced with censored outcomes and/or studies which institute enrollment criterion leading to left truncation. Censored outcomes arise when the event of interest is not observed but rather is known relevant to an observation time(s). Left truncated data occur in studies that exclude participants who have experienced the event prior to being enrolled in the study. If not accounted for, both of these features can lead to inaccurate inferences about the population under study. Thus, to overcome this challenge, herein we propose a novel unified PH model that can be used to accommodate both of these features. In particular, our approach can seamlessly analyze exactly observed failure times along with interval-censored observations, while aptly accounting for left truncation. To facilitate model fitting, an expectation-maximization algorithm is developed through the introduction of carefully structured latent random variables. To provide modeling flexibility, a monotone spline representation is used to approximate the cumulative baseline hazard function.

However, when considering linear energy transfer (LET) and RBE effects, alternative beam arrangements should be investigated.  Purpose:   To investigate the dose and dose averaged LET (LETd ) impact of using new beam arrangements rotating beams 5¬∞-15¬∞ posteriorly to the laterals in prostate cancer treated with pencil-beam-scanning (PBS) proton therapy.  Methods:   Twenty patients with localized prostate cancer were included in this study. Four proton treatment plans for each patient were generated utilizing 0¬∞, 5¬∞, 10¬∞, and 15¬∞ posterior oblique beam pairs relative to parallel-opposed lateral beams. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) from posterior oblique beams were analyzed. Dose-LETd -volume histogram (DLVH) was employed to study the difference in dose and LETd with each beam arrangement. DLVH indices, V ( d , l ) $V( {d,l} )$ , defined as the cumulative absolute volume that has a dose of at least d (Gy[RBE]) and a LETd of at least l (keV/¬µm), were calculated for both the rectum and bladder to the whole group of patients and two-sub groups with and without hydrogel spacer. These metrics were tested using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.  Results:   Rotating beam angles from laterals to slightly posterior by 5¬∞-15¬∞ reduced high LETd volumes while it increased the dose volume in the rectum and increased LETd in bladders. Beam angles rotated five degrees posteriorly from laterals (i.e., gantry in 95¬∞ and 265¬∞) are proposed since they achieved the optimal balance of better LETd sparing and minimal dose increase in the rectum. A reduction of V(50 Gy[RBE], 2.6 keV/¬µm) from 7.41 to 3.96 cc (p < 0.01), and a slight increase of V(50 Gy[RBE], 0 keV/¬µm) from 20.1 to 21.6 cc (p < 0.01) were observed for the group without hydrogel spacer. The LETd sparing was less effective for the group with hydrogel spacer, which achieved the reduction of V(50 Gy[RBE], 2.6 keV/¬µm) from 4.28 to 2.10 cc (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Posterior oblique angle plans improved LETd sparing of the rectum while sacrificing LETd sparing in the bladder in the treatment of prostate cancer with PBS. Beam angle modification from laterals to slightly posterior may be a strategy to redistribute LETd and perhaps reduce rectal toxicity risks in prostate cancer patients treated with PBS.

The clinicopathologic features, laboratory and imaging findings were analyzed and scored according to the 2019 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for IgG4-RD. Results: The 11 patients (male:female is 9‚à∂2; mean age 59 years, range from 44 to 83 years) were initially admitted to the Deparment of Urology/Kidney Transplantation (10 cases) and the Department of Oncology (1 case). All patients had urogenital disorders or imaging abnormalities. Three of the 11 patients had a history of IgG4-RD such as lacrimal gland engorgement, salivary gland engorgement and IgG4-associated pancreatitis. Abnormal retroperitoneal soft tissue and hydronephrosis were found in eight cases, while epididymal and spermatic cord masses were found in one case, simple renal mass in one case, and""benign prostatic hyperplasia""in one case. In the 10 patients tested for serum IgG4, the serum IgG4 level was 0.8-14.4 g/L. Histologically, all cases showed significant lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and storiform fibrosis, and some were accompanied by obliterative phlebitis. The number of IgG4 positive plasma cells was 12-155 per high-power field, and the IgG4/IgG ratio was 15%-77%. According to the 2019 ACR/EULAR IgG4-RD classification standard 11 cases scored 20-48 points, all of which met the diagnostic criteria of IgG4-RUMR. Therapeutically, the patient with a simple renal mass underwent partial nephrectomy. The patient with prostate lesion underwent transurethral resection of prostate and was initially diagnosed as nonspecific chronic prostatitis. Later, the patient was admitted again because of salivary gland swelling, and the pathologic diagnosis was amended. The patient with epididymal and spermatic cord masses participated in a clinical trial about retroperitoneal fibrosis. The remaining eight patients received symptomatic treatment such as adhesiolysis and stent placement. All the patients were subsequently treated with glucocorticoid/immunosuppressant and symptoms relieved. Conclusions: IgG4-RUMR is uncommon. In clinical practice, information from clinical, serologic, radiologic and pathologic evaluations must be integrated.

Data from the initial visit were abstracted from the medical record and questionnaires for analysis.  Results:   Thirty-five individuals with increased PCa risk were followed by the PCRC with a median age of 47 years of age. Twenty individuals (57%) had a family history of PCa, and 34 (97%) had a germline PV associated with an increased risk for developing PCa.

Methods:   Between December 2015 and March 2018, 196 patients undergoing initial transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided PBs were retrospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to the training or validation cohort at a ratio of 7:3. A total of 1044 radiomics features were extracted from grayscale US images of each prostate nodule. After feature selection through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, the radiomics score was developed from the training cohort. The prediction nomograms were developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis based on the radiomics score and clinical risk factors. The performance of the nomograms was assessed and compared in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness.  Results:   The radiomics score consisted of five selected features. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the radiomics score, age, total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), and prostate volume were independent factors for prediction of PCa (all p < 0.05). The integrated nomogram incorporating the radiomics score and three clinical risk factors reached an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.835 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.729-0.941), thereby outperforming the clinical nomogram which based on only clinical factors and yielded an AUC of 0.752 (95% CI, 0.618-0.886) (p = 0.04). Both nomograms showed good calibration. Decision curve analysis indicated that using the integrated nomogram would add more benefit than using the clinical nomogram.

Here we show that ligand-activated AR can form transcriptionally active condensates. Both structured and unstructured regions of AR contribute to the effective phase separation of AR and disordered N-terminal domain plays a predominant role. AR liquid-liquid phase separation behaviors faithfully report transcriptional activity and antiandrogen efficacy.

PC that relapsed after hormonal therapy, referred to as castration-resistant PC (CRPC), often presents with metastasis (mCRPC) and is the major cause of disease lethality. The few available therapies for mCRPC include the Taxanes Docetaxel (DTX) and Cabazitaxel (CBZ). Alas, clinical success of Taxanes in mCRPC is limited by high intrinsic and acquired resistance. Therefore, it remains essential to develop rationally designed treatments for managing therapy-resistant mCRPC disease. The major effect of Taxanes on microtubule hyper-polymerization is a prolonged mitotic block due to activation of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC). Taxane-sensitive cells eventually inactivate SAC and exit mitosis by mitotic catastrophe, resulting in genome instability and blockade of proliferation. Resistant cells remain in mitotic block, and, upon drug decay, resume mitosis and proliferation, underlying one resistance mechanism. In our study we explored the possibility of forced mitotic exit to elevate Taxane efficacy. Inactivation of the SAC component, mitotic checkpoint kinase Mps1/TTK with a small molecule inhibitor (Msp1i), potentiated efficacy of Taxanes treatment in both 2D cell culture and 3D prostasphere settings. Mechanistically, Mps1 inhibition forced mitotic catastrophe in cells blocked in mitosis by Taxanes. Androgen receptor (AR), the main driver of PC, is often mutated or truncated in mCRPC. Remarkably, Mps1i significantly potentiated CBZ cytotoxicity regardless of AR status, in both AR-WT and in AR-truncated CRPC cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that forced mitotic exit by Mps1 inhibition potentiates Taxanes efficacy. Given that several Mps1i's are currently in different stages of clinical trials, our results point to Mps1 as a new therapeutic target to potentiate efficacy of Taxanes in mCRPC patients.""","""['Sadia Sarwar#', 'Viacheslav M Morozov#', 'Hamsa Purayil', 'Yehia Daaka', 'Alexander M Ishov']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cross-resistance between taxanes and new hormonal agents abiraterone and enzalutamide may affect drug sequence choices in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Collateral resistance to taxanes in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer through aberrant androgen receptor and its variants.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.']"""

The resultant hematuria may be severe and refractory to conservative measures. Our objective was to describe the pattern of inpatient treatments among a cohort of patients with radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis requiring pharmacological management.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective case series to identify all inpatient admissions at a single institution during which patients with radiation cystitis underwent pharmacological intervention for refractory hematuria between 2004 and 2019. Patient demographics, medical history, details of radiation therapy, and relevant admission data were collected. Details of treatment, including the use of pharmacotherapy and surgical treatment, were reviewed and summarized.  Results:   We identified 21 patients who were treated during 26 admissions. Most were male (91%) with a history of external beam radiation therapy (86%), primarily for prostate cancer (85%), and a median age of 73 (IQR: 67-85). Most patients received continuous bladder irrigation as the first intervention during their admission (65%), for a median duration of 40 hours (IQR: 25-59). Eleven separate pharmacologic agents were used, with variations in initial pharmacotherapy utilization over time. Most patients were treated with a combination of surgical and pharmacological interventions (85%). The median length of stay was 9 days (IQR: 5-17) and the 90-day readmission rate was 35%.

SALL4 is a new, precise biomarker for testicular germ cell cancers that was just introduced. The whole isoform of SALL4 is called SALL4-A. Regarding the lack of antibody against human SALL4 isoforms, the pattern of expression, the role of each isoform remain unknown. Furthermore, in isoform specific evaluations, we aimed, for the first time, to produce and characterize mAb against human SALL4-A. Immunization of mice were performed with a selected 33-mer synthetic peptide of SALL4-A conjugated with KLH. Hybridoma cells were screened by ELISA for positive reactivity with SALL4-A peptide. From the ascites fluid of mice that had been injected with hybridoma cells, anti-SALL4-A mAbs were isolated using a protein G column. Reactivity of the mAbs was evaluated using the peptide and SALL4-A recombinant protein by ELISA and IHC on testicular cancer tissue as positive control, and normal kidney, stomach and prostate tissues as negative control. The produced mAb could well detect SALL4-A in testicular cancer tissues using IHC, while the reactivity was negative in normal kidney, stomach and prostate tissues. Using ELISA, the mAb affinity for the peptide and SALL4-A recombinant protein was assessed, and it was shown to be reasonably high. The mAb detected SALL4-A in nucleus and cytoplasm of several cancer cells and spermatogonia in testicular cancer tissue. In addition, it could recognize SALL4-A recombinant protein.

PTK6 and SRC kinase are distantly related, share many substrates, and often regulate the same signaling pathways, but whether they interact to regulate signaling is not well understood. We characterized crosstalk between PTK6 and SRC and show that PTK6 can directly phosphorylate SRC to promote its activation. Stable knockdown of PTK6 in multiple cancer cell lines leads to decreased activating phosphorylation of SRC. We show that coexpression of kinase-dead SRC and active PTK6 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn results in activating phosphorylation of SRC. However, there is no reciprocal effect, because active SRC does not promote activating phosphorylation of PTK6. Overexpression of active PTK6 maintained activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), AKT, and FAK, but not SHP2 and ERK1/2 in cells with knockdown of SRC. Both PTK6 and SRC are regulated by EGFR, and its inhibition with erlotinib downregulated PTK6 and to a lesser degree SRC activation in LNCaP cells that overexpress active PTK6. Erlotinib treatment also led to AKT inhibition, but overexpression of active PTK6 prevented this. Our data demonstrate overlapping and unique functions for PTK6 and SRC. Finally, we show that PTK6 and SRC are coexpressed in subsets of human prostate and breast cancer cells, and active PTK6 and active SRC colocalize in prostate cancer, supporting a role for PTK6 in promoting SRC activity in cancer.""","""['Wanian M Alwanian', 'Katarina Vlajic', 'Wenjun Bie', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Angela L Tyner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Protein tyrosine kinase 6 protects cells from anoikis by directly phosphorylating focal adhesion kinase and activating AKT.', 'Protein tyrosine kinase 6 directly phosphorylates AKT and promotes AKT activation in response to epidermal growth factor.', 'Mammary gland specific expression of Brk/PTK6 promotes delayed involution and tumor formation associated with activation of p38 MAPK.', 'Context-specific protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) signalling in prostate cancer.', 'Protein tyrosine kinase 6 signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Protein Tyrosine Kinase 6 in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Appearance of tuft cells during prostate cancer progression.']"""

Since 2015, the addition of docetaxel, abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide or darolutamide with docetaxel to ADT has been shown to improve overall survival (OS) of patients starting ADT for metastatic disease. Castration resistance occurs when disease progresses despite testosterone in the castrate range most commonly with or, more rarely, without detectable metastases. The addition of next-generation antiandrogens to ADT has been shown to improve OS in patients with high-risk nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) identified by a PSA doubling time (DT) ? 10 months. Apalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen agent that binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor without agonist activity. When added to ADT apalutamide has been shown to improve OS by 35 % in patients starting ADT for metastatic prostate cancer both in patients with upfront metastatic disease or after previous treatment with curative intent. Similarly apalutamide has been shown to provide a 14-month OS improvement in patients with nmCRPC and short PSA DT. These OS benefits were obtained at no cost in terms of quality of life.

However, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), a central effector of TLR signaling, has been shown to be responsible for resistance to radiation-induced tumor cell death. In order to better understand the function and epigenetic regulation of IRAK1 in PCa, we performed in vitro cell culture experiments together with integrative bioinformatic studies using the latest single-cell RNA-sequencing data of human PCa and normal prostate (NOR), and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We focused on key effectors of TLR signaling, the Myddosome-complex components IRAK1, IRAK4 and MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response 88), and TRAF6 (tumor-necrosis-factor receptor associated factor 6). In PCa, IRAK1-mRNA was specifically enriched in luminal epithelial cells, representing 57% of all cells, whereas IRAK4 and MYD88 were predominantly expressed in leukocytes, and TRAF6, in endothelial cells. Compared to NOR, only IRAK1 was significantly overexpressed in PCa (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p<2x10-8), whereas the expression of IRAK4, MYD88, and TRAF6 was unchanged in PCa, and IRAK1-expression was inversely correlated with a specific differentially methylated region (IRAK1-DMR) within a predicted promoter region enriched for H3K27ac (Spearman correlation r<-0.36; Fisher's test, p<10-10). Transcription factors with high binding affinities in IRAK1-DMR were significantly enriched for canonical pathways associated with viral infection and carcinogenic transformation in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes analysis. DU145 cells, exhibiting hypermethylated IRAK1-DMR and low IRAK1-expression, reacted with 4-fold increased IRAK1-expression upon combined treatment with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and were unresponsive to infection with the uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain UTI89. In contrast, PC3 and LNCaP cells, exhibiting hypomethylated IRAK1-DMR and high endogenous IRAK1-mRNA levels, responded with strong activation of IRAK1-expression to UTI89 infection. In summary, exclusive overexpression of IRAK1 was observed in luminal epithelial cells in PCa, suggesting it has a role in addition to Myddosome-dependent TLR signaling.

Targeting of the culprits of disease progression is an unmet need. Interleukin (IL)-30 promotes PC onset and development, but whether it can be a suitable therapeutic target remains to be investigated. Here, we shed light on the relationship between IL30 and canonical PC driver genes and explored the anti-tumor potential of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of IL30.  Methods:   PC cell production of, and response to, IL30 was tested by flow cytometry, immunoelectron microscopy, invasion and migration assays and PCR arrays. Syngeneic and xenograft models were used to investigate the effects of IL30, and its deletion by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, on tumor growth. Bioinformatics of transcriptional data and immunopathology of PC samples were used to assess the translational value of the experimental findings.  Results:   Human membrane-bound IL30 promoted PC cell proliferation, invasion and migration in association with STAT1/STAT3 phosphorylation, similarly to its murine, but secreted, counterpart. Both human and murine IL30 regulated PC driver and immunity genes and shared the upregulation of oncogenes, BCL2 and NFKB1, immunoregulatory mediators, IL1A, TNF, TLR4, PTGS2, PD-L1, STAT3, and chemokine receptors, CCR2, CCR4, CXCR5. In human PC cells, IL30 improved the release of IGF1 and CXCL5, which mediated, via autocrine loops, its potent proliferative effect. Deletion of IL30 dramatically downregulated BCL2, NFKB1, STAT3, IGF1 and CXCL5, whereas tumor suppressors, primarily SOCS3, were upregulated. Syngeneic and xenograft PC models demonstrated IL30's ability to boost cancer proliferation, vascularization and myeloid-derived cell infiltration, which were hindered, along with tumor growth and metastasis, by IL30 deletion, with improved host survival. RNA-Seq data from the PanCancer collection and immunohistochemistry of high-grade locally advanced PCs demonstrated an inverse association (chi-squared test, p = 0.0242) between IL30 and SOCS3 expression and a longer progression-free survival of patients with IL30NegSOCS3PosPC, when compared to patients with IL30PosSOCS3NegPC.  Conclusions:   Membrane-anchored IL30 expressed by human PC cells shares a tumor progression programs with its murine homolog and, via juxtacrine signals, steers a complex network of PC driver and immunity genes promoting prostate oncogenesis. The efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of IL30 in curbing PC progression paves the way for its clinical use.""","""['Carlo Sorrentino#', ""Luigi D'Antonio#"", 'Stefania Livia Ciummo', 'Cristiano Fieni', 'Lorena Landuzzi', 'Francesca Ruzzi', 'Simone Vespa', 'Paola Lanuti', 'Lavinia Vittoria Lotti', 'Pier Luigi Lollini', 'Emma Di Carlo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Hematol Oncol""","""['Inactivation of interleukin-30 in colon cancer stem cells via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing inhibits their oncogenicity and improves host survival.', 'Interleukin-30/IL27p28 Shapes Prostate Cancer Stem-like Cell Behavior and Is Critical for Tumor Onset and Metastasization.', 'Interleukin-30 feeds breast cancer stem cells via CXCL10 and IL23 autocrine loops and shapes immune contexture and host outcome.', 'Effect of CRISPR/Cas9-Edited PD-1/PD-L1 on Tumor Immunity and Immunotherapy.', 'The nerve growth factor-delivered signals in prostate cancer and its associated microenvironment: when the dialogue replaces the monologue.', 'CXCL5 promotes tumorigenesis and angiogenesis of glioblastoma via JAK-STAT/NF-Œ∫b signaling pathways.']"""

Here, we for the first time studied the effects of urinary EVs from PC patients and healthy males on the transcriptional landscape of prostate CAFs and normal foreskin fibroblasts.  Methods:   Patient-derived prostate fibroblast primary cultures PCF-54 and PCF-55 were established from two specimens of PC tissues. EVs were isolated from urine samples of 3 patients with PC and 2 healthy males and used for the treatment of prostate fibroblast primary cultures and normal foreskin fibroblasts. The EV-treated fibroblasts were subjected to RNA sequencing analysis.  Results:   RNA sequencing analysis showed that the fibroblast cultures differed significantly in their response to urinary EVs. The transcriptional response of foreskin fibroblasts to the urinary EVs isolated from PC patients and healthy controls was very similar and mostly related to the normal functions of fibroblasts. On the contrary, PCF-54 cells responded very differently - EVs from PC patients elicited transcriptional changes related to the regulation of the cell division and chromosome segregation, whereas EVs from healthy males affected mitochondrial respiration. In PCF-55 cells, EVs from both, PC-patients and controls induced the expression of a number of chemokines such as CCL2, CCL13, CXCL1, CXCL8, whereas pathways related to regulation of apoptotic signaling and production of cell adhesion molecules were triggered specifically by EVs from PC patients.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates that urinary EVs from PC patients and healthy controls elicit distinct transcriptional responses in prostate CAFs and supports the idea that EVs contribute to the generation of functional heterogeneity of CAFs. Moreover, this study suggests that the changes in the gene expression pattern in EV recipient cells might serve as a novel type of functional cancer biomarkers.""","""['Lilite Sadovska', 'Pawel Zayakin', 'Cristina Bajo-Santos', 'Edgars Endzeli≈Ü≈°', 'JƒÅnis Auders', 'Laura Kei≈°a', 'Juris Jansons', 'Vilnis Lietuvietis', 'Aija Linƒì']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Extracellular vesicles of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts creates a pre-metastatic niche in the lung through activating fibroblasts.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts derived extracellular vesicles promote angiogenesis of colorectal adenocarcinoma cells through miR-135b-5p/FOXO1 axis.', 'Distinct prostate cancer-related mRNA cargo in extracellular vesicle subsets from prostate cell lines.', 'The Role of Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts and Extracellular Vesicles in Tumorigenesis.', 'Circulating RNAs in prostate cancer patients.', 'Tumor-derived extracellular vesicle nucleic acids as promising diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast Heterogeneity, Activation and Function: Implications for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   CRPC-patients in the CAPRI-registry between 2010 and 2016 were included in the analyses and followed till 2017. Outcomes were proportion of patients radiologically screened for VMs and proportion of patients with VMs at CRPC-diagnosis and at the start of every treatment line. Groups have been created based on location of VMs (lung, liver, or both) at date of first VM diagnosis. The outcome for these groups was overall survival (OS). Statistics included descriptive analyses, Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazard regression analysis for survival analyses.  Results:   Of 3602 patients from the CAPRI registry, 457 patients (12.7%) were diagnosed with VMs during follow-up: 230 patients with liver, 161 with lung, and 66 with both liver and lung metastases. The proportion of patients radiologically screened for VMs increased per treatment line as did the occurrence rate of VMs. However, 80% of patients at CRPC diagnosis to 40% in the 6th line were not screened for VMs at the start of a systemic treatment. Median OS was 8.6 months for patients with liver, 18.3 with lung and 10.9 with both liver and lung metastases (p < 0.001) from date of first VM diagnosis. After correction for prognostic factors patients with lung metastases had significantly better OS than patients with liver metastases (HR 0.650, p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   This real-world analysis showed that despite the increased rate of radiological staging during follow-up, still 80% to 40% of the patients (CRPC diagnosis to 6th treatment line respectively) were not screened for VMs at the start of a systemic treatment. VMs and location of VMs are key prognostic patient characteristics, impacts survival and have implications for treatment decisions, so routine staging of CRPC-patients is warranted.

Among the many genes implicated, ANXA2, a calcium-dependent phospholipid binding protein, has been found to have a critical role in the progression of PCa into more invasive metastatic phenotype. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the absence of ANXA2 in early PCa and its recurrence in advanced stage are yet unknown. Moreover, recent studies have observed the deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the development and progression of PCa. In this study, we found the down-regulation of miR-936 in metastatic PCa wherein its target ANXA2 was overexpressed. Subsequently, it has been shown that the downregulation of miRNA biogenesis by siRNA treatment in ANXA2-null LNCaP cells could induce the expression of ANXA2, indicating the miRNA mediated regulation of ANXA2 expression. Additionally, we demonstrate that miR-936 regulates ANXA2 expression by direct interaction at coding as well as 3'UTR region of ANXA2 mRNA by luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-936 suppresses the cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration, and invasion abilities of metastatic PCa PC-3 cells in vitro and tumor forming ability in vivo. These results indicate that miR-936 have tumor suppressor properties by regulating the over expression of ANXA2 in hormone-independent metastatic PCa.

MicroRNA (miR)-lethal 7c (let-7c) was implied to be a tumor suppressor in PCa, and treatment with exogenous let-7c targets both cancer cells and their associated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to prevent CRPC progression and metastasis. Exosomes are nanometer-sized membrane-bound vesicles which have an absolute predominance in biocompatibility for drug delivery and gene therapy by mediating cell-to-cell communication. By utilizing the intrinsic tumor-targeting property of MSCs, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of MSC-derived exosomes as an exogenous miR delivery system to target CRPC, using miR let-7c as an example.  Methods:   Bioinformatics analysis was performed to observe miR-let-7c expression in clinical samples by utilizing the GEO database. MSC-derived exosomes were collected from a human bone marrow-derived MSC cell line after cell transfection with either a pre-miR negative control or pre-miR-let-7c, and further characterized through nanoparticle tracking analysis and Western blotting. miR-let-7c expression was determined using RT-qPCR, and the phenotypic effects of both naked and MSC-exosome-encapsulated let-7c on CRPC cells (PC3 and CWR22Rv1) were determined by WST-1 cell proliferation assay and wound healing migration assay.  Results:   miR-let-7c was downregulated in metastatic PCa and high grade group patients. miR-let-7c expression was confirmed to be downregulated in PCa cell lines, with massively decreased in most metastatic CRPC-like cells. Exogenous miR-let-7c can be successfully packaged into MSC exosomes. Treatment with either naked or MSC-exosome-encapsulated miR-let-7c resulted in significant reductions in cell proliferation and migration in CRPC-like PC3 and CWR22Rv1 cells.

Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become an important tool for the detection of prostate cancer in the past two decades. Despite the high sensitivity of MRI for tissue characterization, it often suffers from a lack of specificity. Several well-established pre-processing tools are publicly available for improving image quality and removing both intra- and inter-patient variability in order to increase the diagnostic accuracy of MRI. To date, most of these pre-processing tools have largely been assessed individually. In this study we present a systematic evaluation of a multi-step mpMRI pre-processing pipeline to automate tumor localization within the prostate using a previously trained model.Approach. The study was conducted on 31 treatment-na√Øve prostate cancer patients with a PI-RADS-v2 compliant mpMRI examination. Multiple methods were compared for each pre-processing step: (1) bias field correction, (2) normalization, and (3) deformable multi-modal registration. Optimal parameter values were estimated for each step on the basis of relevant individual metrics. Tumor localization was then carried out via a model-based approach that takes both mpMRI and prior clinical knowledge features as input. A sequential optimization approach was adopted for determining the optimal parameters and techniques in each step of the pipeline.Main results. The application of bias field correction alone increased the accuracy of tumor localization (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.77;p-value = 0.004) over unprocessed data (AUC = 0.74). Adding normalization to the pre-processing pipeline further improved diagnostic accuracy of the model to an AUC of 0.85 (p-value = 0.000 12). Multi-modal registration of apparent diffusion coefficient images to T2-weighted images improved the alignment of tumor locations in all but one patient, resulting in a slight decrease in accuracy (AUC = 0.84;p-value = 0.30).Significance. Overall, our findings suggest that the combined effect of multiple pre-processing steps with optimal values has the ability to improve the quantitative classification of prostate cancer using mpMRI.

It is known to have dual role in cancer as a tumor promoter and tumor suppressor. AJUBA has a key role in systemic malignancies like esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, colorectal cancer, cervical, breast, prostate cancer, etc. But there is very sparse literature available regarding its expression profile in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and moreover its expression has not been observed in normal oral mucosa (NOM). Thus, the aim of this research is to explore the expression profile of AJUBA by immunohistochemical method in NOM and OSCC. Furthermore, we also evaluated the association of AJUBA expression with clinicopathologic parameters. A total of 84 samples of formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue blocks comprising of 42 cases each of NOM and OSCC were subjected to detect immunoexpression of AJUBA. We found enhanced intense immune-expression of AJUBA in OSCC cases than compared with NOM and found to be statistically significant. The parameters specific to histologic tumor grade and inflammatory response in OSCC also found to have statistically significant with AJUBA expression. Our study is first of its kind to reveal AJUBA expression in basal and suprabasal layer of NOM suggestive of its definitive role in differentiation and stratification process.

We studied the associations between residential green spaces and site-specific cancer mortality in urban Belgium.  Methodology:   We linked the 2001 Belgian census, register mortality data for 2001-2014, and environmental information (green spaces and air pollution) at baseline residence (2001). We included residents from the largest Belgian urban areas aged ‚â• 30 years at baseline. Exposure to residential green spaces was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Urban Atlas, and perceived neighbourhood greenness (from the census). We used Cox proportional hazards models to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and their 95 % confidence intervals (95 %CI) of the mortality risk from lung, colorectal, breast (in women) and prostate cancer (in men) per interquartile range increment in residential green spaces. We further analyzed the role of outdoor air pollution and effect modification by age and socioeconomic position (SEP) in main associations.  Results:   2,441,566 individuals were included at baseline. During follow-up, 1.2 % died from lung cancer, 0.6 % from colorectal cancer, 0.8 % from breast cancer, and 0.6 % from prostate cancer. After adjustment, higher exposure to green spaces was associated with a reduced mortality risk from lung cancer and breast cancer [e.g., for NDVI within 300 m, HR:0.946 (95 %CI:0.924,0.970), and HR:0.927 (95 %CI:0.892,0.963), respectively], but not with colorectal or prostate cancer mortality. For the latter, a suggestive hazardous effect of green spaces was found. Air pollution seemed to have only a marginal role. Beneficial effects of greenspace were generally stronger in < 65-year-old, but no clear trend by SEP was found.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that residing in green areas could decrease mortality risk from lung and breast cancer, potentially independent from air pollution.

To address this challenge, we developed a cell line model mimicking luminal prostate epithelial cells by modifying the immortalized prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1 to constitutively express the androgen receptor (AR). RWPE-1-AR cells express known AR target genes, and exhibit coexpression of luminal and basal markers characteristic of transient amplifying cells, and an RNA signature resembling prostate luminal progenitor cells. Under unstimulated conditions, constitutive AR expression does not have a biologically significant effect on the proliferation of RWPE-1 cells, but when stimulated by androgens, growth is retarded. The transcriptional response of RWPE-1-AR cells to androgen stimulation involves suppression of the growth-related KRAS pathway and is thus markedly different from that of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP and its derivative AR-overexpressing LNCaP-ARhi cells, in which growth- and cancer-related pathways are upregulated. Hence, the nonmalignant AR-positive RWPE-1-AR cell line model could be used to study the transformation of the prostate epithelium.""","""['Konsta Kukkonen', 'Bryn Autio-Kimura', 'Hanna Rauhala', 'Juha Kesseli', 'Matti Nykter', 'Leena Latonen', 'Tapio Visakorpi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Androgen responsive adult human prostatic epithelial cell lines immortalized by human papillomavirus 18.', 'Acquisition of androgen independence by human prostate epithelial cells during arsenic-induced malignant transformation.', 'Increased expression of androgen receptor sensitizes prostate cancer cells to low levels of androgens.', 'Differential androgen receptor signals in different cells explain why androgen-deprivation therapy of prostate cancer fails.', 'Stromal androgen receptor in prostate development and cancer.']"""

Resistance to these inhibitors in prostate cancer frequently involves AR-dependent mechanisms resulting in a retained AR dependence of the tumor. More effective or alternative AR inhibitors are therefore required to limit progression in these resistant stages. Here, we applied the structural information of the ligand-binding domain (LBD) dimerization interface to screen in silico for inhibitors. A completely new binding site, the Dimerisation Inhibiting Molecules (DIM) pocket, was identified at the LBD dimerization interface. Selection of compounds that fit the DIM pocket via virtual screening identified the DIM20 family of compounds which inhibit AR transactivation and dimerization of the full-length AR as well as the isolated LBDs. Via biolayer interferometry, reversible dose-dependent binding to the LBD was confirmed. While DIM20 does not compete with 3H-DHT for binding in the LBP, it limits the maximal activity of the AR indicative of a noncompetitive binding to the LBD. DIM20 and DIM20.39 specifically inhibit proliferation of AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines, with only marginal effects on AR-negative cell lines such as HEK 293 and PC3.

Results:   A total of 1575 men were included in the analysis. PCa was diagnosed in 63.2% (996/1575) of men and csPCa in 41.7% (656/1575) of men. Use of the RPCRC-3/4 could have prevented 37.3% (587/1575) of all MRIs within this cohort, thereby missing 18.3% (120/656) of csPCa diagnoses. After recalibration and adjustment of risk thresholds to 20% for PCa and 10% for csPCa, use of the recalibrated RPCRC-3/4 could have prevented 15.1% (238/1575) of all MRIs, resulting in 5.3% (35/656) of csPCa diagnoses being missed. The performance of the RPCRC-MRI was good; use of this risk calculator could have prevented 10.7% (169/1575) of all biopsies, resulting in 1.2% (8/656) of csPCa diagnoses being missed.  Conclusion:   The RPCRC-3/4 underestimates the probability of having csPCa within this Dutch clinical cohort, resulting in significant numbers of csPCa diagnoses being missed. For optimal performance of a risk calculator in a specific cohort, evaluation of its performance within the population under study is essential.""","""['Marinus J Hagens', 'Piter J Stelwagen', 'Hans Veerman', 'Sybren P Rynja', 'Martijn Smeenge', 'Vincent van der Noort', 'Ton A Roeleveld', 'Jolien van Kesteren', 'Sebastiaan Remmers', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Reducing Biopsies and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans During the Diagnostic Pathway of Prostate Cancer: Applying the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator to the PRECISION Trial Data.', 'External Validation of the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Risk Calculator and the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in a Swedish Population-based Screening Cohort.', 'Risk-based Patient Selection for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy after Negative Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Random Biopsy Avoids Unnecessary Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-na√Øve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.']"""

However, the efficacy of Cabazitaxel (CAB) in fourth and later lines of therapy is rarely investigated.  Material and methods:   Fifty three patients with mCRPC treated with CAB in fourth line or later were included in our retrospective study, which involved eight uro-oncology centers in Germany. Clinical and tumor characteristics, as well as PSA-response rates were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier plots addressed overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Logistic regression models predicted risk factors of overall mortality (OM).  Results:   Of 53 patients, 79% (n=42), 19% (n=10) and 2% (n=1) received CAB in fourth, fifth and sixth line. A median of 4 cycles of CAB were administered. Median PSA at start of CAB was 199ng/ml (interquartile range (IQR) 70-869). In total, 89% had bone and 40% visceral metastases prior to the start of CAB. Moreover, 30% of patients received Docetaxel in first line therapy for mCRPC. Most frequent sequence of therapy was abiraterone followed by docetaxel and followed by enzalutamide. Overall, median PSA-response rate was -20% (IQR -80 to +10%). Patients with docetaxel in first line had a significantly better median PSA-response on CAB (-80 vs. 20%, P=0.03). Median OS, radiographic PFS and overall PFS were 14.8 (Confidence interval (CI): 11.0-20.8), 3.0 (CI: 2.9-4.0) and 2.9 (CI: 2.0-3.3) months, respectively. In multivariable analyses, visceral metastases, PSA >100ng/ml, ISUP4+5 and later administration of Docetaxel were predictors of OM.

A total of 146 metastatic PCs including 134 (92%) PC without neuroendocrine differentiation-prostatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) and 12 (8%) with neuroendocrine differentiation (PC-NED) were retrieved. Triplicate tissue microarrays (TMA) of 54 surgically excised PCs were constructed for immunostains. Most cases showed Gleason 4 or 5 patterns. Nine percent of cases did not have a prior history of PC and 7% had 2 or more primary malignancies. PAC metastasized more commonly to lymph nodes (49%), and PC-NED metastasized more commonly to liver (58%). Cytologically, metastatic PCs show acini, cribriform, nest, and solid clusters. Most PACs showed conspicuous or prominent nucleoli. PC-NEDs showed typical cytologic features of low-grade or high-grade neuroendocrine neoplasm, or small cell carcinoma features. PACs could be immunoreactive to CDX2 (25%), CK20 (11%), NKX3.1 (99%), PSA (88%), PSAP (78%), and PSMA (92%). PC-NEDs were immunoreactive to neuroendocrine immunomarkers (CD56 [100%], chromogranin [67%], and synaptophysin [100%]) and p63 (25%), and lost expression of prostate-specific markers (NKX3.1, PSA, PSAP, and PSMA). Both PACs and PC-NEDs might be immunoreactive to CK7 (18% versus 33%), GATA3 (4% versus 0%), PAX8 (2% versus 50%, P < .05), and TTF1 (3% versus 57%, P < .05).

Methods:   The detailed data of patients with primary malignant brain tumors following an initial malignant tumor outside the central nervous system were extracted from SEER. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze patient demographic and clinical characteristics. We also extracted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) stratified by age, race, sex, history of radiation or chemotherapy, histology findings, and primary cancer site.  Results:   We identified 5,212 patients diagnosed with primary malignant brain tumors following systemic malignancies. Most patients had prostate cancer, breast cancer, and skin melanoma as the primary cancer. The median duration between the first diagnosis of cancer and that of the subsequent malignant brain tumor was 53 months. Glioblastoma was the most common subsequent malignant brain tumor type. The prognosis after subsequent malignant brain tumor diagnosis was poor. The SIRs differed most by race, cancer site, and cancer type. Patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia had the highest risk of developing primary malignant brain tumors.  Conclusion:   Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of clinical data and the SIRs of patients with primary malignant brain tumors afterward other systemic malignancies.

This study aimed to determine how exposure to paclitaxel affects the intracellular stiffness of human oesophageal cancer of South African origin in vitro. A human oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line WHCO1 was cultured on glass substrates (2D) and in collagen gels (3D) and exposed to paclitaxel for up to 48 h. Cellular morphology and stiffness were assessed with confocal microscopy, visually aided morpho-phenotyping image recognition and mitochondrial particle tracking microrheology at 24 and 48 h. In the 2D environment, the intracellular stiffness was higher for the paclitaxel-treated than for untreated cells at 24 and 48 h. In the 3D environment, the paclitaxel-treated cells were stiffer than the untreated cells at 24 h, but no statistically significant differences in stiffness were observed at 48 h. In 2D, paclitaxel-treated cells were significantly larger at 24 and 48 h and more circular at 24 but not at 48 h than the untreated controls. In 3D, there were no significant morphological differences between treated and untreated cells.

The sense-oriented paRNA (S-paRNA) includes a functional C/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs16260). The A-allele leads to decreased transcriptional activity and increased prostate cancer risk. The polymorphic site is known to affect binding of a microRNA-guided Argonaute 1 (AGO1) complex and recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes to silence the promoter. Yet the SNP is distant from the microRNA-AGO1 binding domain in both primary sequence and secondary structure, raising the question of how regulation occurs. Here we report the 3D NMR structure of the 104-nucleotide domain of the S-paRNA that encompasses the SNP and the microRNA-binding site.

Methods:   Homology between published TAAs and non-self HIV-derived epitopes have been assessed by BLAST homology. Structural analyses have been performed by bioinformatics tools. Immunological validation of CD8+ T cell cross-reactivity has been evaluated ex vivo by tetramer staining.  Findings:   Sequence homologies between multiple TAAs and HIV epitopes have been found. High structural similarities between the paired TAAs and HIV epitopes as well as comparable patterns of contact with HLA and TCR Œ± and Œ≤ chains have been observed. Furthermore, cross-reacting CD8+ T cells have been identified.  Interpretation:   This is the first study showing a molecular mimicry between HIV antigens an TAAs identified in breast, prostate and colon cancers. Therefore, it is highly reasonable that memory CD8+ T cells elicited during the HIV infection may play a key role in controlling development and progression of such cancers in the PLWHA lifetime.

BRCA reversion mutations are a known mechanism of acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors in multiple cancer types, although their impact and prevalence in mCRPC remain unknown.  Objective:   To examine the prevalence of BRCA reversion mutations in the plasma of patients with BRCA+ mCRPC after progression on rucaparib.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with BRCA+ mCRPC enrolled in Trial of Rucaparib in Prostate Indications 2 (TRITON2) were treated with rucaparib after progressing on one to two lines of androgen receptor-directed and one taxane-based therapy. Cell-free DNA from the plasma of 100 patients, collected at the end of treatment after confirmed progression before May 5, 2020, was queried for BRCA reversion mutations using next-generation sequencing (NGS).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The association of clinical efficacy and postprogression genomics was measured in 100 patients with BRCA+ mCRPC treated with rucaparib.  Results and limitations:   No baseline BRCA reversion mutations were observed in 100 BRCA+ patients. NGS identified somatic BRCA reversion mutations in 39% (39/100) of patients after progression. Reversion rates were similar for BRCA2 and BRCA1, irrespective of germline or somatic status, but higher in samples with a high tumor DNA fraction. Most patients with reversions (74%, 29/39) had two or more reversion mutations occurring subclonally at lower allele frequencies than the original BRCA mutations. The incidence of BRCA reversion mutations increased with the duration of rucaparib treatment. The frequency of reversion mutations was higher in patients with an objective (58%) or a prostate-specific antigen (69%) response compared with those without either (39% and 29%, respectively).  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that BRCA reversion mutations are a significant mechanism of acquired resistance to rucaparib in patients with BRCA+ mCRPC, with evidence of subclonal convergence promoting systemic resistance.  Patient summary:   Men with BRCA mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer enrolled in TRITON2 were treated with rucaparib after progressing on one to two lines of androgen receptor-directed and one taxane-based therapy.

Labeling PSMA, it showed to be effective in the treatment of prostate cancer and research is undergoing in order to improve its production capacity. Currently, there are still few data published concerning operational radiation protection in its use, both in clinics and in radiopharmacy, and even some basic data are not readily available. This papers aims to estimate the emission gamma-ray constant of 225Ac when at equilibrium with its descendants, and the transmission factors for a broad beam of the gamma-rays emitted by 225Ac and its descendants.  Materials & methods:   Monte Carlo simulations were performed using FLUKA 4.2, considering firstly the source in air, in absence of any shielding, and secondly by adding an increasing thicknesses of Lead, Concrete or Tungsten. In order to obtain statistically meaningful results, high-statistics simulations were performed by sampling up to 1010 primary decay events. As the shielding thickness increased, an appropriate variance reduction technique (importance biasing) was applied.  Results:   The specific gamma ray emission constant for 225Ac at equilibrium with descendants resulted (3.26 ¬± 0.03) √ó 10-5 mSv/h per 1 MBq at a distance of 100 cm. The transmission factors are presented in detail and data have been appropriately interpolated and fitting parameters are reported.  Conclusions:   The attenuation curves show a clear bi-exponential trend: performing shielding calculations by adopting a simple approach based on a single value of Half Value Layer (HVL) or Tenth Value Layer (TVL) cannot provide adequate results. In conclusion, our results may be useful in the design of shielded hot cells or accessories necessary for operational radiation protection.""","""['Mario Marengo', 'Angelo Infantino']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Tenth value layers for 60Co gamma rays and for 4, 6, 10, 15, and 18 MV x rays in concrete for beams of cone angles between 0 degrees and 14 degrees calculated by Monte Carlo simulation.', 'Brachytherapy structural shielding calculations using Monte Carlo generated, monoenergetic data.', 'Radiation transmission data for radionuclides and materials relevant to brachytherapy facility shielding.', 'Monte Carlo simulation of photon buildup factors for shielding materials in diagnostic x-ray facilities.', 'Monte Carlo simulation of photon buildup factors for shielding materials in radiotherapy x-ray facilities.']"""

Further, MAO A/Pten double knockout (DKO) mice were generated and demonstrated that the deletion of MAO A delayed prostate tumor development in the Pten knockout mouse model of prostate adenocarcinoma. Here, we investigated its effect on immune cells in the tumor microenvironment in MAO A/Pten DKO mouse model. Our results shows that Paraffin embedded prostate tissues from MAO A/Pten DKO mice had elevated markers of immune stimulation (CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, granzyme B, and IFNŒ≥) and decreased expression of markers of immune suppression (FoxP3, CD11b, HIF-1-alpha, and arginase 1) compared to parental Pten knockouts (MAO A wildtype). CD11b+ myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) were the primary immunosuppressive cell types in these tumors. The data suggest that deletion of MAO A reduces immune suppression in prostate tumors to enhance antitumor immunity in prostate cancer. Thus, MAO A inhibitor may alleviate immune suppression, increase the antitumor immune response and be used for cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Jessica A Lapierre', 'Lauren A Geary', 'Julie K Jang', 'Alan L Epstein', 'Frank Hong', 'Jean C Shih']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Loss of MAOA in epithelia inhibits adenocarcinoma development, cell proliferation and cancer stem cells in prostate.', 'Pten null prostate epithelium promotes localized myeloid-derived suppressor cell expansion and immune suppression during tumor initiation and progression.', 'Targeting monoamine oxidase A for T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.', 'Monoamine oxidase isoenzymes: genes, functions and targets for behavior and cancer therapy.', 'Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA): A promising target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Design, synthesis, and biological activity of dual monoamine oxidase A and heat shock protein 90 inhibitors, N-Methylpropargylamine-conjugated 4-isopropylresorcinol for glioblastoma.', 'Breast cancer and neurotransmitters: emerging insights on mechanisms and therapeutic directions.']"""

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, incidence, and treatment patterns in mHSPC in Spain.  Patients and methods:   Multicenter, observational, longitudinal, retrospective study in routine clinical practice of patients diagnosed with mHSPC treated in Spanish hospitals between 2015 and 2019 (ECHOS study). Electronic medical records were extracted from BIG-PAC database, which contains geographically representative Spanish centers.  Results:   Data from 379 men with mHSPC were included. The prevalence of mHSPC ranged between 12.2-14.6% per year, representing from 671 to 824 annual cases with an increasing trend. The mean incidence along the 4-year period was 2.5%, with annual incidence ranging 2.2-3.0%. New annual cases of de novo and recurrent disease ranged between 7-11 and 77-104, respectively, with no trend being observed. These patients were mostly recurrent (91%) with high-volume disease (68.6%). The most common first-line therapy was ADT combined with docetaxel (53%), followed by ADT alone (23.8%), combination of ADT and abiraterone (11.2%), and radiotherapy (8.6%). In the last 12 months before diagnosis of metastasis, most men had been submitted to radical prostatectomy (84.9%). The remaining patients had received radiotherapy (12%) or no treatment at all (3.8%).

Electronic-patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice (eRAPID) is a secure online system for patients to self-report symptoms, generating immediate advice for hospital contact or self-management. This pilot study aimed to establish feasibility and acceptability of the system.  Methods and materials:   In a prospective 2-center randomized parallel-group pilot study, patients undergoing radical pelvic RT for prostate cancer (prostateRT) or chemoRT for lower gastrointestinal and gynecological cancers were randomized to usual care (UC) or eRAPID (weekly online symptom reporting for 12, 18, and 24 weeks). Primary outcomes were recruitment/attrition, study completion, and patient adherence. Secondary outcomes were effect on hospital services and performance of patient outcome measures. Missing data, floor/ceiling effects, and mean change scores were examined for Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, Quality of Life (EORTC QLQ C-30), self-efficacy, and EuroQol (EQ5D).  Results:   From 228 patients approached, 167 (73.2%) were consented and randomized (83, eRAPID; 84, UC; 87, prostateRT; 80, chemoRT); 150 of 167 completed 24 study weeks. Only 16 patients (9.6%) withdrew (10, eRAPID; 6, UC). In the eRAPID arm, completion rates were higher in patients treated with prostateRT compared with chemoRT (week 1, 93% vs 69%; week 2, 93% vs 68%; week 12, 69% vs 55%). Overall, over 50% of online reports triggered self-management advice for milder adverse events. Unscheduled hospital contact was low, with no difference between eRAPID and UC. Return rates for outcome measures were excellent in prostateRT (97%-91%; 6-24 weeks) but lower in chemoRT (95%-55%; 6-24 weeks). Missing data were low (1%-4.1%), ceiling effects were evident in EQ5D-5L, self-efficacy-scale, and FACT-Physical Wellbeing. At 6 weeks, the chemoRT-eRAPID group showed less deterioration in FACT-G, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EQ5D-Visual Analogue Scale than UC, after baseline adjustment.  Conclusions:   eRAPID was successfully added to UC at 2 cancer centers in different patient populations. Acceptability and feasibility were confirmed with excellent adherence by prostate patients, but lower by those undergoing chemoRT for gynecological cancers.""","""['Patricia Holch', 'Kate L Absolom', 'Ann M Henry', 'Katrina Walker', 'Andrea Gibson', 'Eleanor Hudson', 'Zoe Rogers', 'Marie Holmes', 'Rosemary Peacock', 'Simon Pini', 'Alexandra Gilbert', 'Susan Davidson', 'Jacqueline Routledge', 'Anthony Murphy', 'Kevin Franks', 'Claire Hulme', 'Jenny Hewison', 'Carolyn Morris', 'Lucy McParland', 'Julia Brown', 'Galina Velikova']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Electronic self-reporting of adverse events for patients undergoing cancer treatment: the eRAPID research programme including two RCTs.', 'eRAPID electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice: a pilot study protocol in pelvic radiotherapy.', 'Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial of eRAPID: eHealth Intervention During Chemotherapy.', 'Electronic patient self-Reporting of Adverse-events: Patient Information and aDvice (eRAPID): a randomised controlled trial in systemic cancer treatment.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.']"""

Methods:   Data from 283 consecutive patients complaining of a single episode/recurrent haemospermia were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were stratified into low vs high-risk according to EAU guidelines, whose diagnostic performance was then validated. We identified a new risk stratification model based on clinical factors associated with (i) positive semen culture and (ii) prostate cancer (PCa) and bladder cancer (BC). Diagnostic accuracy of the two predictive models (EAU vs New) was assessed and decision curve analyses (DCA) tested their clinical benefit.  Results:   Overall, 259 (91.5%) were high-risk and 24 (8.5%) low risk according to the EAU guidelines. Recurrent haemospermia was reported by 134 (47.4%) patients. 126 (44.5%) had baseline CCI score ‚â• 1.

A Case Study of Abiraterone for Metastatic Prostate Cancer""","""Background:   Two pivotal randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrate that abiraterone acetate + prednisone (AAP) combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) significantly extends the survival of men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) compared with ADT alone. Their subgroup analyses indicate that the survival benefit is significant for younger men but not older men. We aimed to assess whether publication of the RCTs was associated with differential real-world AAP utilization by age groups.  Methods:   Using TriNetX electronic medical records data collected from 43 healthcare organizations across the United States, we performed a difference-in-differences event study among men with newly diagnosed mHSPC observed from June 2014 to June 2019. Eligible subjects were identified based on a comprehensive published algorithm. We analyzed the change in utilization rate of AAP before versus after publication of the RCTs among men aged &lt;70 years versus ‚â•70 years, adjusting for demographic factors and clinical conditions.  Results:   Our study included 6,888 men with newly diagnosed mHSPC with 12,738 observations, of whom 46% were aged &lt;70 years. The prepublication trends of AAP utilization were similar between the age groups, whereas publication of the RCTs was associated with a 3.5% higher adjusted uptake rate of AAP among younger men (95% CI, 1.2%-5.8%) relative to older men. This estimate reflects an uptake rate nearly 3 times higher than would have been expected had younger men followed the same utilization trends as older men. The estimates remained consistent throughout the postpublication period.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that publication of the RCTs was associated with faster uptake of AAP among younger versus older men with newly diagnosed mHSPC, despite the absence of clinical guidance for differential treatment selection. This finding highlights the importance of confirmatory studies among older men, considering the uncertainties of subgroup analyses in RCTs.""","""['Boshen Jiao', 'Yaw A Nyame', 'Josh J Carlson', 'Louis P Garrison', 'Anirban Basu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Treatment of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in Belgium: a real world data analysis.', 'Hormone na√Øve metastatic prostate cancer: How to treat it?', 'Patient-reported outcomes following abiraterone acetate plus prednisone added to androgen deprivation therapy in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic castration-naive prostate cancer (LATITUDE): an international, randomised phase 3 trial.']"""

Each patient underwent PET/CT with 68 Ga-PSMA-11 and 18 F-PSMA-1007 (within 2 weeks). Assessment of both set of images included delineating number and characteristics of lesions, measurement of tracer uptake (SUV max ), miPSMA scoring, and PET-based stage categorization.  Results:   Intraprostatic lesions were detected in all patients by both tracers with concordant PET-based T stage. Median SUV max of the dominant PSMA-positive prostatic lesions was not significantly different with 18 F-PSMA-1007 and 68 Ga-PSMA-11 (19.9 vs 19.4, P = 0.127, n = 40).

Few additional PET-positive regional lymph nodes (n = 3) were exclusively detected by 18 F-PSMA in 2 patients without altering PET-based N stage. Extraregional lymph nodes (n = 123 in 17/40 patients) and visceral metastatic lesions (n = 18 in 3/40 patients) were detected concordantly by both tracers. PET-positive marrow based and skeletal metastases (n = 71) were detected in 14/40 (35%) patients by both tracers.

The underlying etiology of prostate cancer is not well understood. Chronic inflammation plays a significant role in carcinogenesis overall and may be involved in the development of PCa, but immune-related biomarker studies in prostate cancer are limited.  Methods:   The associations of serum concentrations of cytokines, systemic immune biomarkers, with risk of PCa were assessed in a randomly selected sub-cohort (n = 798, mean age = 73 years) of the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study, a prospective cohort of older men. At baseline, we measured serum interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFŒ±), soluble receptors (SR) of IL-6 (IL-6SR) and TNF (TNFŒ±SR1 and TNFŒ±SR2), and IL-10. The risk of PCa was calculated for higher tertile levels of measured individual cytokines relative to the lowest tertile using Cox proportional hazards regression models.  Results:   After an average 6 years of follow-up, 59 men developed incident PCa. Men in the middle or highest tertile of IL-10 had a statistically significant 50% lower risk of PCa compared to the lowest tertile (hazard ratio = 0.50, 95% confidence interval = 0.30-0.84). There was no significant association between any of the other cytokines measured and PCa risk.  Conclusion:   IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was associated with lower risk of PCa.

We addressed this uncertainty within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER 2000-2018) database.  Material and methods:   We identified lymph node negative SCCP patients who either underwent ILND (pN0) or clinical examination only (cN0). We tested for the effect of ILND vs no ILND on cancer-specific mortality (CSM) in Kaplan-Meier plots, univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses, in a pT stage-specific fashion, before and after 1:3 propensity score matching (PSM). Sensitivity analyses were conducted according to historical and contemporary treatment periods as well as geographic regions.  Results:   Of 2520 SCCP patients, 369 (15%) underwent ILND (pN0) vs 2151 (85%) did not (cN0). The pN0 vs cN0 distribution according to pT stages was as follows: 80 (7%) vs 1092 (93%) in pT1b, and 289 (21%) vs 1059 (79%) in pT2-3. At 36 months, CSM-free survival in pT2-3 stage was 89% in ILND vs 74% in no ILND patients (multivariable hazard ratio: 0.42, CI 0.30-0.60, p < 0.001). This result was confirmed in sensitivity analyses, and after 1:3 PSM. The same analyses could not be completed in pT1b stage due to insufficient number of observations and events.

However, regulation of FBP1 protein expression and its exact role in prostate cancer (PCa) is largely unclear. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is one of the most frequently deleted tumor suppressor genes in human PCa. However, the role of PTEN loss in aberrant Warburg effect in cancer remains poorly understood.  Methods:   Expression of PTEN and FBP1 was analyzed in several PCa cell lines and prostate tumor tissues in mice. Western blot (WB) and RT-PCR approaches were used to examine how PTEN regulates FBP1 expression. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and in vivo ubiquitination assays were used to define the regulatory mechanisms. A PCa xenograft model was employed to determine the impact of PTEN regulation of FBP1 on PCa growth in vivo.  Result:   We demonstrated that in a manner dependent of PI3K/AKT signal pathway PTEN regulated FBP1 expression in various PCa cell lines and tumors in mice. We confirmed that this regulation took place at the protein level and was mediated by SKP2 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Mechanistically, we showed that serine 271 phosphorylation of FBP1 by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) was essential for SKP2-mediated degradation of FBP1 protein induced by PTEN loss. Most importantly, we further showed that loss of PTEN expression enhanced Warburg effect and PCa growth in mice in a manner dependent, at least partially on FBP1 protein degradation.  Conclusions:   Our results reveal a novel tumor-suppressive feature of PTEN in restraining FBP1 degradation and the Warburg effect. These results also suggest that prohibiting FBP1 protein degradation could be a viable therapeutic strategy for PTEN-deficient PCa.""","""['Changze Song', 'Jianong Zhang', 'Xiao Liu', 'Meilu Li', 'Dejie Wang', 'Zhijian Kang', 'Jiaao Yu', 'Jiuwei Chen', 'Hongxin Pan', 'Honglei Wang', 'Guangbin Li', 'Haojie Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase loss modulates STAT3-dependent expression of PD-L1 and cancer immunity.', 'SKP2 loss destabilizes EZH2 by promoting TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination to suppress prostate cancer.', 'Skp2 regulates androgen receptor through ubiquitin-mediated degradation independent of Akt/mTOR pathways in prostate cancer.', 'RUNX2 overexpression and PTEN haploinsufficiency cooperate to promote CXCR7 expression and cellular trafficking, AKT hyperactivation and prostate tumorigenesis.', 'Role of Ubiquitination in PTEN Cellular Homeostasis and Its Implications in GB Drug Resistance.', 'Roles of protein post-translational modifications in glucose and lipid metabolism: mechanisms and perspectives.', 'GBE1 Promotes Glioma Progression by Enhancing Aerobic Glycolysis through Inhibition of FBP1.']"""

Bmal1 KO resulted in significantly decreased ventral and dorsolateral lobes with less Ki-67-positive epithelial cells than the controls. Next, the cap analysis of gene expression revealed that genes associated with cell cycles were differentially expressed in the pBmal1 KO prostate. Cdkn1a (coding p21) was diurnally expressed in the control mouse prostate, a rhythm which was disturbed in pBmal1 KO. Meanwhile, the knockdown of BMAL1 in epithelial RWPE-1 and stromal WPMY-1 cell lines decreased proliferation. Furthermore, RWPE-1 BMAL1 knockdown increased G0/G1-phase cell numbers but reduced S-phase numbers.

In this study, MTT and transwell assays were used to study the cytotoxicities of 13 major tryptophan metabolites on PCa and normal prostate epithelial cell lines. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) was used to analyze metabolic changes in cells treated with tryptamine. Flow cytometry, confocal imaging, and Western blot were used to test the apoptosis induced by tryptamine. It was shown that tryptamine had obvious inhibitory effects on PCa cell lines PC-3 and LNCaP, stronger than those on the normal prostate cell line RWPE-1. Tryptamine was further shown to induce apoptosis and inhibit PC-3 cell migration. Metabolic changes including amino acid metabolism related to cell proliferation and metastasis were found in PC-3 cells treated with tryptamine. Furthermore, a PC-3 xenograft mouse model was used to study the effect of tryptamine in vivo. The intratumoral injection of tryptamine was demonstrated to significantly reduce the tumor growth and tumor sizes in vivo; however, intraperitoneal treatment resulted in increased tumor growth.

However, PSA is not specific for PCa stage confirmation, leading in false positive result and involving PCa over-diagnosis and over-treatment. HSP27 and Menin have been found to be overexpressed in a wide range of human cancers. Recent studies showed how HSP27 interacts with and stabilizes Menin to lead PCa progression and treatment resistance. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the correlation of HSP27 and Menin molecular expression, and their prognosis value in PCa with respect to clinicopathological features. Elisa was employed to measure serum HSP27 and Menin concentrations in 73 PCa patients and 80 healthy individuals. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to determine HSP27 and Menin tissue expression in 57 tumors and 4 Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) tissues. Serum HSP27 expression correlated with its tissue expression in all PCa patients, whereas serum Menin expression correlated only with tissue expression in aggressive PCa patients. Moreover, the results showed a positive correlation between HSP27 and Menin either in serum (r = 0.269; p = 0.021) or in tissue (r = 0.561; p < 0.0001). In aggressive PCa, serum expression of HSP27 and Menin was positively correlated (r = 0.664; R = 0.441; p = 0.001). The correlation between HSP27 and Menin expression in tissue was found only in patients with aggressive PCa (r = 0.606; R = 0.367; p = 0.004). Statistical analysis showed that the expression of both biomarkers was positively correlated with the hormone resistance or sensitivity, tumor aggressiveness, metastasis, Gleason Score, death and did not significantly correlate with age and PSA. Survival was illustrated by Kaplan‚àíMeier curves; increased HSP27 and Menin expression correlated with shorter survival of PCa patients (p = 0.001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Accuracy in predicting aggressiveness was quantified by the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). We demonstrated that the combination of HSP27/Menin was statistically greater than PSA; it achieved an AUC of 0.824 (95% CI, 0.730‚àí0.918; p < 0.0001). However, HSP27/Menin/PSA combination decreased the diagnostic value with an AUC of 0.569 (95% CI, 0.428‚àí0.710; p = 0.645).

Although the specific downstream signaling events post the ErbB receptor and AKT co-targeting varied between the PC3- and DU145-lineage cells, synergistic anti-proliferative and enhanced pro-apoptotic responses occurred across the wild-type and the taxane-resistant cells, independent of their basal AKT activation state, their degree of paclitaxel- or docetaxel-resistance, or whether this resistance was mediated by the ATP Binding Cassette transport proteins. Dual targeting also led to enhanced anti-tumor responses in vivo, although there was pharmacodynamic discordance between the PCa cells in culture versus the tumor xenografts in terms of the relative activation and inhibition states of AKT and ERK under basal conditions and upon AKT and/or ErbB targeting. The consistent inhibition, particularly of AKT, occurred both in vitro and in vivo, independent of the underlying PTEN status.

Abiraterone is an irreversible inhibitor of CYP17, and CYP17 inhibition is a required step in testosterone biosynthesis. Previous studies have shown that abiraterone trough levels are predictive of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). It has not been demonstrated if this association exists for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). In this study, we aimed to explore the correlation and association between abiraterone trough levels and PSA levels in patients with mHSPC. MATERIAL AND METHODS This was a single-center, prospective, observational study of patients with mHSPC being treated with abiraterone acetate (AA) 1000 mg once daily. Abiraterone trough levels (22-26 h after drug administration) were drawn at 1, 3, and 7 months after treatment initiation. RESULTS Thirteen patients with mHSPC were enrolled, and complete pharmacokinetic data were available for 8 patients. The mean trough levels at 1 month, 3 months, and 7 months were 34.49 ng/mL (3.36-240.46), 13.82 ng/mL (2.91-29.96), and 15.7 ng/mL (3.58-26.86), respectively. The correlation between the 1-month abiraterone trough level and 1-month PSA level was 0.29 (P=0.38), between 3-month abiraterone trough and 3-month PSA was -0.61 (P=0.08), and between 7-month abiraterone trough and 7-month PSA was -0.31 (P=0.54). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated a trend toward a negative correlation between 3-month abiraterone trough levels and PSA levels, but the correlation was not statistically significant.

Understanding how novel therapies are working across the different stages of the disease is critical for their proper positioning in the spectrum of PCa treatments. The targeting of proprotein convertase PACE4 (Paired basic Amino Acid-Cleaving Enzyme 4) has been proposed as a novel approach to treat PCa. Animal studies performed on LNCaP xenografts, an androgen-dependent model, already yielded positive results. In this study, we tested PACE4 inhibition on JHU-LNCaP-SM, a newly described androgen-independent model, in cell-based and xenograft assays. Like LNCaP, JHU-LNCaP-SM cells express PACE4 and its oncogenic isoform PACE4-altCT. Using isoform-specific siRNAs, downregulation of PACE4-altCT resulted in JHU-LNCaP-SM growth inhibition. Furthermore, JHU-LNCaP-SM responded to the PACE4 pharmacological inhibitor known as C23 in cell-based assays as well as in athymic nude mice xenografts. These data support the efficacy of PACE4 inhibitors against androgen independent PCa thereby demonstrating that PACE4 is a key target in PCa. The JHU-LNCaP-SM cell line represents a model featuring important aspects of androgen-independent PCa, but it also represents a very convenient model as opposed to LNCaP cells for in vivo studies, as it allows rapid screening due to its high implantation rate and growth characteristics as xenografts.""","""['Nawel Mekdad', 'Thi Minh Hue Tran', 'Roxane Desjardins', 'Anna Kwiatkowska', 'Fr√©d√©ric Couture', 'Robert Day']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['PACE4-altCT isoform of proprotein convertase PACE4 as tissue and plasmatic biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of a novel metastatic prostate cancer cell line of LNCaP origin.', 'PACE4-based molecular targeting of prostate cancer using an engineered ‚Å∂‚Å¥Cu-radiolabeled peptide inhibitor.', 'Role of proprotein convertases in prostate cancer progression.', 'The proprotein convertases furin and PACE4 play a significant role in tumor progression.']"""

Methods:   TheraP was a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 2 trial that recruited men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after treatment with docetaxel who were suitable for cabazitaxel from 11 hospitals in Australia. Participants were required to be 18 years old or older; have adequate haematological, renal, and liver function; and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using a centralised system using minimisation with a random component and that stratified patients by disease burden, previous treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone, and study site. Patients were either given cabazitaxel (20 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks for up to ten cycles) or [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (6¬∑0-8¬∑5 GBq intravenously every 6 weeks for up to six cycles). The primary study endpoint, analysed previously, was PSA response rate. The prespecified tertiary study endpoint was association between total tumour quantitative parameters on PSMA-PET, FDG-PET, and baseline characteristics with clinical outcomes. A SUVmean of 10 or higher on PSMA-PET was evaluated as a predictive biomarker for response to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel.

The median follow-up at data cutoff of July 20, 2020, was 18¬∑4 months (IQR 12¬∑8-21¬∑8). 35 (35%) of 99 men who were assigned [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and 30 (30%) of 101 men who were assigned cabazitaxel had high PSMA uptake (SUVmean of ‚â•10). Odds of PSA response to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel were significantly higher for men with SUVmean of 10 or higher compared with those with SUVmean of less than 10 (odds ratio [OR] 12¬∑19 [95% CI 3¬∑42-58¬∑76] vs 2¬∑22 [1¬∑11-4¬∑51]; padj=0¬∑039 for treatment-by-SUVmean interaction). PSA response rate for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 compared with cabazitaxel was 32 (91% [95% CI 76-98]) of 35 men versus 14 (47% [29-65]) of 30 men in patients with SUVmean of 10 or higher, and 33 (52% [39-64]) of 64 men versus 23 (32% [22-45]) of 71 men in those with SUVmean of less than 10. High-volume disease on FDG-PET (MTV ‚â•200 mL) was seen in 30 (30%) of 99 men who were assigned [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and 30 (30%) of 101 men who were assigned cabazitaxel. PSA response rate for both treatment groups combined for FDG-PET MTV of 200 mL or higher versus FDG-PET MTV of less than 200 mL was 23 (38% [95% CI 26-52]) of 60 men versus 79 (56% [48-65]) of 140 men (OR 0¬∑44, 95% CI 0¬∑23-0¬∑84; padj=0¬∑035).  Interpretation:   In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, PSMA-PET SUVmean was predictive of higher likelihood of favourable response to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 than cabazitaxel, which provides guidance for optimal [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 use. High FDG-PET MTV was associated with lower responses regardless of randomly assigned treatment, warranting further research for treatment intensification. A strength of this analysis is the validation of pre-specified cutpoints within a multicentre, randomised, controlled trial. Quantitative PET parameters used, however, require specialised software and are not yet routinely available in most clinics.

We therefore wanted to compare rates of invasive treatment and 30-day mortality between AMIs in patients with PCa and AMIs in the general Norwegian male population.  Methods:   Norwegian population-based registry data from 2013 to 2019 were used in this cohort study to identify AMIs in patients with a preceding PCa diagnosis. We compared invasive treatment rates and 30-day mortality in AMI patients with PCa to the same outcomes in all male AMI patients in Norway. Invasive treatment was defined as performed angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Standardized mortality (SMR) and incidence ratios, and logistic regression were used to evaluate the association between PCa risk groups and invasive treatment.  Results:   In 1,018 patients with PCa of all risk groups, the total rates of invasive treatment for AMIs were similar to the rates in the general AMI population. In patients with ST-segment elevation AMIs, rates were lower in metastatic PCa compared to localized PCa (OR 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.49). For non-ST-segment elevation AMIs, there were no differences between PCa risk groups. The 30-day mortality after AMI was lower in PCa patients than in the total population of similarly aged AMI patients (SMR 0.77, 95% CI: 0.61-0.97).  Conclusion:   Except for patients with metastatic PCa experiencing an ST-segment elevation AMI, PCa patients were treated as frequent with invasive treatment for their AMI as the general AMI population. 30-day all-cause mortality was lower after AMI in PCa patients compared to the general AMI population.""","""['Rachel Bedenis Forster', 'Camilla Kjellstadli', 'Tor √Öge Myklebust', 'Grace Egeland', 'Gerhard Sulo', 'Tone Bj√∏rge', 'Kaare Harald B√∏naa', 'Petur Benedikt Juliusson', 'Rune Kv√•le']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cardiology""","""['Predictors of non-invasive therapy and 28-day-case fatality in elderly compared to younger patients with acute myocardial infarction: an observational study from the MONICA/KORA Myocardial Infarction Registry.', 'Acute myocardial infarction in the elderly: Treatment strategies and 28-day-case fatality from the MONICA/KORA myocardial infarction registry.', 'Correlation of Admission Heart Rate With Angiographic and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Right Coronary Artery ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: HORIZONS-AMI (The Harmonizing Outcomes With Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction) Trial.', 'Incidence, treatment, and outcomes of acute myocardial infarction following transcatheter or surgical aortic valve replacement.', 'Current characteristics and management of ST elevation and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction in the Tokyo metropolitan area: from the Tokyo CCU network registered cohort.', 'Approaches to Prevent and Manage Cardiovascular Disease in Patients Receiving Therapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Metformin, a first-line therapy for treating T2DM, is increasingly being used for its anticancer effects; however, the literature is limited on the effect of metformin dose on overall survival in patients with stage IV cancer. Overall survival was defined as the time interval from the date of diagnosis to the last known follow-up or death from any cause. Subjects who were alive on December 31, 2016 were censored. In this cohort study we examined the relationship between metformin dose and overall survival in persons with both T2DM and stage IV lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, or pancreas cancers. We used a retrospective study design with Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of the 2007-2016 of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare (SEER) dataset.

Thus, we sought to identify the intrinsic molecular subtypes of mCRPC and assess molecular and clinical correlates in the largest combined cohort of mCRPC samples with gene expression data available to date.  Experimental design:   We combined and batch-effect corrected gene expression data from four mCRPC cohorts from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (N = 157), a small-cell neuroendocrine (NE) prostate cancer (SCNC)-enriched cohort from Weill Cornell Medicine (N = 49), and cohorts from the Stand Up 2 Cancer/Prostate Cancer Foundation East Coast Dream Team (N = 266) and the West Coast Dream Team (N = 162).  Results:   Hierarchical clustering of RNA-sequencing data from these 634 mCRPC samples identified two distinct adenocarcinoma subtypes, one of which (adeno-immune) was characterized by higher gene expression of immune pathways, higher CIBERSORTx immune scores, diminished ASI benefit, and non-lymph node metastasis tropism compared with an adeno-classic subtype. We also identified two distinct subtypes with enrichment for an NE phenotype, including an NE-liver subgroup characterized by liver metastasis tropism, PTEN loss, and APC and SPOP mutations compared with an NE-classic subgroup.

Thus, we chose to further investigate the functional role of AR-mediated alternative RNA splicing in PCa disease progression. We selected two AR-interacting RNA splicing factors, Src associated in mitosis of 68 kDa (SAM68) and DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box helicase 5 (DDX5) to examine their associative roles in AR-dependent alternative RNA splicing. To assess the true physiological role of AR in alternative RNA splicing, we assessed splicing profiles of LNCaP PCa cells using exon microarrays and correlated the results to PCa clinical datasets. As a result, we were able to highlight alternative splicing events of clinical significance. Initial use of exon-mini gene cassettes illustrated hormone-dependent AR-mediated exon-inclusion splicing events with SAM68 or exon-exclusion splicing events with DDX5 overexpression. The physiological significance in PCa was investigated through the application of clinical exon array analysis, where we identified exon-gene sets that were able to delineate aggressive disease progression profiles and predict patient disease-free outcomes independently of pathological clinical criteria. Using a clinical dataset with patients categorized as prostate cancer-specific death (PCSD), these exon gene sets further identified a select group of patients with extremely poor disease-free outcomes. Overall, these results strongly suggest a nonclassical role of AR in mediating robust alternative RNA splicing in PCa. Moreover, AR-mediated alternative spicing contributes to aggressive PCa progression, where we identified a new subtype of lethal PCa defined by AR-dependent alternative splicing.""","""['Sean Seltzer', 'Paresa N Giannopoulos', 'Tarek A Bismar', 'Mark Trifiro', 'Miltiadis Paliouras']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['The RNA helicase p68 is a novel androgen receptor coactivator involved in splicing and is overexpressed in prostate cancer.', 'The RNA-binding and adaptor protein Sam68 modulates signal-dependent splicing and transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor.', 'p68/DdX5 supports Œ≤-catenin & RNAP II during androgen receptor mediated transcription in prostate cancer.', 'Splicing Factors Have an Essential Role in Prostate Cancer Progression and Androgen Receptor Signaling.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Daily MR imaging followed by organ and target segmentation adjustments allow to capture anatomical changes, improve target volume coverage, and reduce the risk of side effects. The introduction of automatic segmentation techniques could help to further improve the online adaptive workflow by shortening the re-contouring time and reducing intra- and inter-observer variability. In fractionated RT, prior knowledge, such as planning images and manual expert contours, is usually available before irradiation, but not used by current artificial intelligence-based autocontouring approaches.  Purpose:   The goal of this study was to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for automatic segmentation of bladder, rectum (organs at risk, OARs), and clinical target volume (CTV) for prostate cancer patients treated at 0.35 T MR-Linacs. Furthermore, we tested the CNNs generalization on data from independent facilities and compared them with the MR-Linac treatment planning system (TPS) propagated structures currently used in clinics. Finally, expert planning delineations were utilized for patient- (PS) and facility-specific (FS) transfer learning to improve auto-segmentation of CTV and OARs on fraction images.  Methods:   In this study, data from fractionated treatments at 0.35 T MR-Linacs were leveraged to develop a 3D U-Net-based automatic segmentation. Cohort C1 had 73 planning images and cohort C2 had 19 planning and 240 fraction images. The baseline models (BMs) were trained solely on C1 planning data using 53 MRIs for training and 10 for validation. To assess their accuracy, the models were tested on three data subsets: (i) 10 C1 planning images not used for training, (ii) 19 C2 planning, and (iii) 240 C2 fraction images. BMs also served as a starting point for FS and PS transfer learning, where the planning images from C2 were used for network parameter fine tuning. The segmentation output of the different trained models was compared against expert ground truth by means of geometric metrics. Moreover, a trained physician graded the network segmentations as well as the segmentations propagated by the clinical TPS.  Results:   The BMs showed dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of 0.88(4) and 0.93(3) for the rectum and the bladder, respectively, independent of the facility. CTV segmentation with the BM was the best for intermediate- and high-risk cancer patients from C1 with DSC=0.84(5) and worst for C2 with DSC=0.74(7). The PS transfer learning brought a significant improvement in the CTV segmentation, yielding DSC=0.72(4) for post-prostatectomy and low-risk patients and DSC=0.88(5) for intermediate- and high-risk patients. The FS training did not improve the segmentation accuracy considerably. The physician's assessment of the TPS-propagated versus network-generated structures showed a clear advantage of the latter.  Conclusions:   The obtained results showed that the presented segmentation technique has potential to improve automatic segmentation for MR-guided RT.""","""['Maria Kawula', 'Indrawati Hadi', 'Lukas Nierer', 'Marica Vagni', 'Davide Cusumano', 'Luca Boldrini', 'Lorenzo Placidi', 'Stefanie Corradini', 'Claus Belka', 'Guillaume Landry', 'Christopher Kurz']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Automatic segmentation of the clinical target volume and organs at risk in the planning CT for rectal cancer using deep dilated convolutional neural networks.', 'Clinical implementation of MRI-based organs-at-risk auto-segmentation with convolutional networks for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Automatic AI-based contouring of prostate MRI for online adaptive radiotherapy.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'A Review of the Metrics Used to Assess Auto-Contouring Systems in Radiotherapy.']"""

Aim of the study is to evaluate the added value of SBx in addition to TBx in terms of prostate cancer (PCa) detection rates (CDR), and to test the concordance between multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) findings and fusion biopsy results in terms of cancer location.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective, multicentric study that gathered data on 1992 consecutive patients who underwent elastic fusion biopsy between 2011 and 2020. A standardized approach was used, with TBx (2-4 cores per target) followed by SBx (12-14 cores). We assessed CDR of TBx, of SBx, and TBx+SBx for all cancers and clinically significant PCa (csPCa), defined as ISUP score ‚â•2. CDR was evaluated according to radiological and clinical parameters, with a particular focus on PI-RADS 3 lesions. In a subgroup of 1254 patients we tested the discordance between mpMRI findings and fusion biopsy results in terms of cancer location. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of CDR.  Results:   CDR of TBx+SBx was 63.0% for all cancers and 38.8% of csPCa. Per-patient analysis showed that SBx in addition to TBx improved CDR by 4.5% for all cancers and 3.4% for csPCa. Patients with lesions scored as PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 were diagnosed with PCa in 27.9%, 72.8%, and 92.3%, and csPCa in 10.7%, 43.6%, and 69.3%, respectively. When positive, PI-RADS 3 lesions were ISUP grade 1 in 61.1% of cases. Per-lesion analysis showed that discordance between mpMRI and biopsy was found in 56.6% of cases, with 710 patients having positive SBx outside mpMRI targets, of which 414 (58.0%) were clinically significant. PSA density ‚â•0.15 was a strong predictor of CDR.  Conclusions:   The addition of systematic mapping to TBx contributes to a minority of per-patient diagnoses but detects a high number of PCa foci outside mpMRI targets, increasing biopsy accuracy for the assessment of cancer burden within the prostate. High PSA-density significantly increases the risk of PCa, both in the whole cohort and in PI-RADS 3 cases.""","""['Marco Oderda', 'Simone Albisinni', 'Daniel Benamran', 'Giorgio Calleris', 'Mauro Ciccariello', 'Alessandro Dematteis', 'Romain Diamand', 'Jean-Luc Descotes', 'Gaelle Fiard', 'Valerio Forte', 'Alessandro Giacobbe', 'Alessandro Marquis', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Aurel Messas', 'Giovanni Muto', 'Alexandre Peltier', 'Leire Rius', 'Giuseppe Simone', 'Thierry Roumeguere', 'Riccardo Faletti', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'A clinical available decision support scheme for optimizing prostate biopsy based on mpMRI.', 'A cohort of transperineal electromagnetically tracked magnetic resonance imaging/ultrasonography fusion-guided biopsy: assessing the impact of inter-reader variability on cancer detection.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Follow-up of negative MRI-targeted prostate biopsies: when are we missing cancer?', 'Predictors of Prostate Cancer at Fusion Biopsy: The Role of Positive Family History, Hypertension, Diabetes, and Body Mass Index.']"""

Methods:   Data of consecutive mCRPC patients from 2017 to 2021 who were treated with PSMA-RLT and underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) were collected and analyzed for response and survival outcomes.

The median progression-free survival (PFS) of this cohort was 3 months (95% confidence interval: 1.6-4.4 months). On NGS, 21 genetic alterations were reported in 10/15 (67%) patients, of which 13 were DDR-associated alterations involving the genes: ATM (n = 3), BRCA2 (n = 3), TP53 (n = 2), PTEN (n = 2), FANCD2 (n = 1), FANCM (n = 1), and NBN (n = 1).

EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling plays an important role in the development of radioresistance. Herein, we have assessed the modulatory effects of silibinin on radiation-induced resistance via DNA repair pathways in EGFR-knockdown DU145 cells. shRNA-based silencing of EGFR was done in radioresistant human PCa DU145 cells and effects of ionizing radiation (IR) and silibinin were assessed using clonogenic and trypan blue assays. Furthermore, radiosensitizing effects of silibinin on PCa in context with EGFR were analyzed using flow cytometry, comet assay, and immunoblotting. Silibinin decreased the colony formation ability with an increased death of DU145 cells exposed to IR (5 Gray), with a concomitant decrease in Rad51 protein expression. Silibinin (25 ŒºM) augmented the IR-induced cytotoxic effect in EGFR-knockdown PCa cells, along with induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Further, we studied homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways in silibinin-induced DNA double-strand breaks in EGFR-knockdown DU145 cells. Silibinin down-regulated the expression of Rad51 and DNA-dependent protein kinase proteins without any considerable effect on Ku70 and Ku80 in IR-exposed EGFR-knockdown PCa cells.

Methods:   From November 2019 to September 2021, biopsy-na√Øve patients underwent mpMRI-TRUS fusion imaging combined with mpUS-guided targeted biopsies (TB) and systematic biopsies (SB). To further evaluate the additional diagnostic value of mpUS, the imaging features of 202 focus obtained from fusion imaging were assessed. The diagnostic accuracies of mpMRI-TRUS fusion imaging and the combination of mpMRI-TRUS fusion imaging with mpUS for csPCa were comparatively evaluated.  Results:   A total of 202 prostate lesions (160 patients) were included in the final analysis, of which 105 were csPCa, 16 were ciPCa, and 81 were noncancerous. The median patient age was 69 (65-73) years and the median tPSA was 22.07 (11.22-62.80) ng/mL. For csPCa, the detection rate of TB was higher than that of SB (50.0% vs. 45.5%, p < 0.05). The imaging characteristics of mpUS in the PCa and non-PCa groups were significantly different (p < 0.001). When compared with mpMRI-TRUS fusion imaging, the positive predictive value, false positive rate, and area under the curve (AUC) of csPCa diagnosis by mpMRI-TRUS fusion imaging combined with mpUS increased by 11.30%, decreased by 19.58%, and increased from 0.719 to 0.770 (p < 0.05), respectively.  Conclusion:   TB can improve the detection rate of csPCa and hence can be effectively used in the diagnosis and risk assessment of csPCa.

PCa inevitably progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after androgen deprivation therapy treatment, and castration-resistant state means a shorter survival time than other causes. Here we aimed to define castration-dependent and -independent diver genes and molecular pathways in CRPC which are responsible for such lethal metastatic events.  Methods:   By employing digital gene expression (DGE) profiling, the alterations of the epididymal gene expression profile in the mature and bilateral castrated rat were explored. Then we detect and characterize the castration-dependent and -independent genes and pathways with two data set of CPRC-associated gene expression profiles publicly available on the NCBI.  Results:   We identified 1,632 up-regulated and 816 down-regulated genes in rat's epididymis after bilateral castration. Differential expression analysis of CRPC samples compared with the primary PCa samples was also done. In contrast to castration, we identified 97 up-regulated genes and 128 down-regulated genes that changed in both GEO dataset and DGE profile, and 120 up-regulated genes and 136 down-regulated genes changed only in CRPC, considered as CRPC-specific genes independent of castration. CRPC-specific DEGs were mainly enriched in cell proliferation, while CRPC-castration genes were associated with prostate gland development. NUSAP1 and NCAPG were identified as key genes, which might be promising biomarkers of the diagnosis and prognosis of CRPC.

Clarifying the genes related to BCR and its possible pathways is vital for providing diagnosis and treatment methods to delay the progress of BCR. An analysis of data concerning PCa from previous datasets of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) was performed. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were used to evaluate the expression of SLC14A1 in prostate tissues. Kaplan-Meier analysis, Pearson correlation, and single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (ssGSEA) were used to identify the potential pathway and molecular mechanism of the function of SLC14A1 in BCR of PCa. The expression of SLC14A1 is significantly reduced in prostate cancer cells and tissue comparing to normal prostate epithelial cell and para-cancerous tissue. As indicated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, High expression of SLC14A1 could increase the BCR-free survival time of PCa patients. This effect might be related to the interaction with miRNAs (has-miR-508, has-mir-514a2, and has-mir-449a) and the infiltration of B cells.

Although the processes regulating MSC function are incompletely understood, it has been shown that stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can alter MSC activity. More specifically, it has been reported that human bone marrow-derived MSCs can be ""polarized"" by TLR priming into contrasting immunomodulatory functions, with opposite (supportive or suppressive) roles in tumor progression and inflammation. Adipose-derived MSCs (ASCs) represent a promising alternative MSC subpopulation for therapeutic development because of their relative ease of isolation and higher abundance compared with their bone marrow-derived counterparts; however, the polarization of ASCs remains unreported.  Methods:   In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic and functional consequences of short-term, low-level stimulation of ASCs with TLR3 and TLR4 agonists.  Results:   In these assays, we identified transient gene expression changes resembling the reported pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory MSC phenotypes. Furthermore, these priming strategies led to changes in the functional properties of ASCs, affecting their ability to migrate and modulate immune-mediated responses to prostate cancer cells in vitro.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been done on the pathological grading of prostate cancer from single ultrasound images. In this work, a novel Automatic Region-based Gleason Grading (ARGG) network for prostate cancer based on deep learning is proposed. ARGG consists of two stages: (1) a region labeling object detection (RLOD) network is designed to label the prostate cancer lesion region; (2) a Gleason grading network (GNet) is proposed for pathological grading of prostate ultrasound images. In RLOD, a new feature fusion structure Skip-connected Feature Pyramid Network (CFPN) is proposed as an auxiliary branch for extracting features and enhancing the fusion of high-level features and low-level features, which helps to detect the small lesion and extract the image detail information. In GNet, we designed a synchronized pulse enhancement module (SPEM) based on pulse-coupled neural networks for enhancing the results of RLOD detection and used as training samples, and then fed the enhanced results and the original ones into the channel attention classification network (CACN), which introduces an attention mechanism to benefit the prediction of cancer grading. Experimental performance on the dataset of prostate ultrasound images collected from hospitals shows that the proposed Gleason grading model outperforms the manual diagnosis by physicians with a precision of 0.830.

In this paper, we describe the frequency of multimorbid chronic diseases, HIV and depression among men in Soweto, South Africa (SA) with and without prostate cancer and determine whether the presence of multimorbid diseases is associated with metastatic and high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   A population-based case-control study on prostate cancer was conducted among black men in Soweto. All participants completed a baseline survey on sociodemographics, lifestyle, and comorbid medical conditions. All participants completed a depression screening survey and HIV testing at enrolment. Blood pressure measurements and blood testing for fasting glucose, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein were performed on a subset of randomly selected cases and controls. For men with prostate cancer, clinical T staging was assessed with the digital rectal examination, the diagnosis was confirmed with a biopsy and PSA levels were assessed at presentation. The metastatic staging was assessed by bone scans, and this was confirmed with PSMA PET scans, CT scans and X-rays, standard for our resource-constrained setting. Normal PSA scores were used as an inclusion criterion for controls.  Results:   Of the 2136 men (1095 with prostate cancer and 1041 controls) included in the analysis, 43.0% reported at least one chronic metabolic disease; 24.1% reported two metabolic diseases; 5.3% reported three metabolic diseases; and 0.3% reported four metabolic diseases. Men with prostate cancer were more likely to report a multimorbid chronic metabolic disease compared to controls (p<0.001) and more likely to test positive for HIV (p = 0.05). The majority of men (66.2%) reported at least one metabolic disease, tested negative for HIV and had a negative depression screen. The clinical characteristics of men with prostate cancer, were as follows: 396 (36.2%) had a Gleason score of 8 and above; 552 (51.3%) had a PSA score of >20ng/ml; 233 (21.7%) had confirmed metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis. Older age was associated with metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 1.043 95% CI:1.02-1.07) and NCCN defined high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer (OR = 1.03 95% CI:1.01-1.05), whilst being hypertensive was protective (OR = 0.63 95% CI:0.47-0.84 and OR = 0.55 95% CI:0.37-0.83) respectively for metastatic and high-risk, non-metastatic prostate cancer.

For example, laser thinning of the overlying bone can improve optical access, enabling deeper imaging into the BM as well as enhancing optical resolution by reducing scattering and aberration. Laser micromachining can also be used to provide physical access into the BM by creating access ports for micropipette insertion and delivery of cells to precise locations in the BM, as well as for the extraction of BM cells and interstitial fluid, all under image guidance. This chapter provides a detailed protocol for installing a laser-micromachining capability for users with an existing multiphoton microscope. Additionally, we briefly outline how such a system improves the optical resolution during imaging as well as its potential use to study injury response.""","""['Christa Haase', 'Dmitry Richter', 'Charles P Lin']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Methods Mol Biol""","""['Characterization of multiphoton microscopy in the bone marrow following intravital laser osteotomy.', 'Intravital Microscopy for Hematopoietic Studies.', 'In vivo flow cytometry combined with intravital microscopy to monitor kinetics of transplanted bone marrow mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow.', 'Analyzing hematopoietic stem cell homing, lodgment, and engraftment to better understand the bone marrow niche.', 'The Therapeutic Potential of Hematopoietic Stem Cells in Bone Regeneration.']"""

At present, there are relatively few studies on the role of this protein in tumors. This study aimed to explore the relationship between COMP and pan-cancer, and analyzed its diagnostic and prognostic value.  Methods:   The Cancer Genome Atlas database, the Genotype-Tissue Expression database and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia database was used for gene expression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess the diagnostic value of COMP in pan-cancer. Kaplan-Meier plots were used to assess the relationship between COMP expression and prognosis of cancers. R software v4.1.1 was used for statistical analysis, and the ggplot2 package was used for visualization.  Results:   COMP was significantly overexpressed in 15 human cancers and showed significantly difference in 12 molecular subtypes and 16 immune subtypes. In addition, the expression of COMP is associated with tumor immune evasion. The ROC curve showed that the expression of COMP could predict the occurrence of 16 kinds of tumors with relative accuracy, including adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) (AUC = 0.737), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) (AUC = 0.896), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) (AUC = 0.760), colon adenocarcinoma/rectum adenocarcinoma esophageal carcinoma (COADREAD) (AUC = 0.775), lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBC) (AUC = 0.875), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) (AUC = 0.773), kidney chromophobe (KICH) (AUC = 0.809), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) (AUC = 0.906), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) (AUC = 0.721), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) (AUC = 0.944), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) (AUC = 0.792), skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (AUC = 0.746), stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) (AUC = 0.711), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) (AUC = 0.823), thymoma (THYM) (AUC = 0.777) and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS) (AUC = 0.769). Furthermore, COMP expression was correlated with overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and progression-free interval (PFI) in ACC (OS, HR = 4.95, DSS, HR = 5.55, PFI, HR = 2.79), BLCA (OS, HR = 1.59, DSS, HR = 1.72, PFI, HR = 1.36), KIRC (OS, HR = 1.36, DSS, HR = 1.94, PFI, HR = 1.57) and COADREAD (OS, HR = 1.46, DSS, HR = 1.98, PFI, HR = 1.43). We selected previously unreported bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA) for further study and found that COMP could be an independent risk factor for OS, DSS and PFI. Moreover, we found differentially expressed genes of COMP in BLCA and obtained top 10 hub genes, including LGR4, LGR5, RSPO2, RSPO1, RSPO3, RNF43, ZNRF3, FYN, LYN and SYK. Finally, we verified the function of COMP at the cellular level by using J82 and T24 cells and found that knockdown of COMP could significantly inhibit migration and invasion. This finding supports that COMP could be a potential biomarker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis encompassing tumor microenvironment, disease stage and prognosis.  Conclusion:   This finding supports that COMP could be a potential biomarker for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis encompassing tumor microenvironment, disease stage and prognosis.""","""['Bingjie Guo#', 'Yajing Wang#', 'Wenyu Liu', 'Sailong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Transl Oncol""","""['Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'Identifies microtubule-binding protein CSPP1 as a novel cancer biomarker associated with ferroptosis and tumor microenvironment.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of PARP1 Alterations as Biomarkers in the Prediction of Immunotherapeutic Effects and the Association of Its Expression Levels and Immunotherapy Signatures.', 'The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.', 'Integrative data mining and meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic role of microRNA-200 family in various human malignant neoplasms: A consideration on heterogeneity.', 'Identification of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA Regulatory Network in Pterygium-Associated Conjunctival Epithelium.']"""

Therefore, new molecular targets and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. In many cases, some reports show increased levels of endocannabinoids and their receptors in cancer, a condition often associated with tumour aggressiveness. Recent studies have suggested that cannabinoid-1/2 receptors contribute to tumour growth in a variety of cancers, including pancreatic, colon, prostate, and breast cancer. Understanding how cannabinoids can regulate key cellular processes involved in tumorigenesis, such as: cell proliferation and cell death, is crucial to improving existing and new therapeutic approaches for the cancer patients. The present study was aimed to characterize the in-vitro effect of L-759633 (a selective CB2 receptor agonist), ACPA (a selective CB1 receptor agonist) and ACEA (a selective CB1 receptor agonist) on the cell proliferation, clonogenicity, and apoptosis in pancreatic (PANC1) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells.  Methods:   The viability and/or proliferation of cells were detected by MTS assay. A clonogenic survival assay was used to detect the ability of a single cell to grow into a colony. Apoptosis was determined with Annexin V staining (Annexin V-FITC/PI test) and by analyzing the expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2).  Results:   We found that selective CB1/2 agonists suppressed cell proliferation, clonogenicity and induced proapoptotic function in human PANC1 pancreatic and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Based on our findings, these agonists led to the inhibition of both cell viability and clonogenic growth in a dose dependent manner. CB1/2 agonists were observed to induce intrinsic apoptotic pathway by upregulating Bax, while downregulating Bcl-2 expression levels.  Conclusion:   Our data suggests that CB1/2 agonists have the therapeutic potential through the inhibition of survival of human PANC1 pancreatic and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and also might be linked with further cellular mechanisms for the prevention (Fig. 5, Ref. 49).""","""['Nergiz Hacer Turgut', 'Guliz Armagan', 'Gozde Kasapligil', 'Mumin Alper Erdogan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bratisl Lek Listy""","""['Involvement of the CB2 cannabinoid receptor in cell growth inhibition and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest via the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists inhibit tumor growth and metastasis of breast cancer.', 'Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors differentially regulate TNF-Œ±-induced apoptosis and LPA1-mediated pro-survival signaling in HT22 hippocampal cells.', 'Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptor ligand specificity and the development of CB2-selective agonists.', 'Cannabinoids and omega-3/6 endocannabinoids as cell death and anticancer modulators.']"""

Androgen-receptor (AR) inhibitors, including enzalutamide (ENZ), are used for the treatment of mCRPC; however, most patients develop resistance to ENZ. Herein, we propose that the repression of SLC22A3 by AR-V7/YAP1/TAZ conferred ENZ resistance in mCRPC. SLC22A3 expression is specifically downregulated in the ENZ-resistant C4-2B MDVR cells, and when YAP1/TAZ is hyperactivated by AR full-length or AR-V7, these proteins interact with DNMT1 to repress SLC22A3 expression. We observed low SLC22A3 expression and high levels of TAZ or YAP1 in mCRPC patient tissues harbouring AR-V7 and the opposite expression patterns in normal patient tissues. Our findings suggest a mechanism underlying ENZ resistance by providing evidence that the AR-V7/YAP1/TAZ axis represses SLC22A3, which could be a potential treatment target in prostate cancer.""","""['Eunjeong Seo', 'Byula Jee', 'Jae Hoon Chung', 'Wan Song', 'Hyun Hwan Sung', 'Hwang Gyun Jeon', 'Byong Chang Jeong', 'Seong Il Seo', 'Seong Soo Jeon', 'Hyun Moo Lee', 'Minyong Kang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9¬Æ to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'The evolving role of enzalutamide on the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic Significance of Chromogranin A Expression in the Initial and Second Biopsies in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Cardiac safety profile of type II kinase inhibitors: Analysis of post-marketing reports from databases of European Medicine Agency & World Health Organization.']"""

This longitudinal study investigates course and predictors of PC-related anxiety in long-term PC survivors treated by radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   Two thousand nine hundred and three survivors from the multicenter German Familial PC Database completed the Memorial Anxiety Scale for PC on average 11 years after RP at the initial assessment in 2015 and then 5 years later. Hierarchical multiple linear regression was used to assess predictors of PC-related anxiety at follow-up.  Results:   PC-related anxiety remained stable over the 5 years. In hierarchical multiple linear regression, longitudinal predictors of PC-related anxiety 5 years later included a lower level of education (beta: -0.035, p = 0.019), biochemical recurrence (BCR; beta: 0.054, p = 0.002), late BCR (beta: 0.054, p < 0.001), PC anxiety at initial assessment (beta: 0.556, p < 0.001), HRQoL (beta: -0.076, p < 0.001), depression and anxiety symptoms (beta: 0.072, p = 0.001; beta: 0.165, p < 0.001).

To test this, we built gene expression signatures in tissue samples for specific mutations and found that phenocopy signatures broadly increased accuracy of drug response predictions in-vitro compared to DNA mutation alone, and identified additional cancer cell lines that respond well with a positive/negative predictive value on par or better than DNA mutations.

Testosterone deficiency increases oxidative stress in the penile tissue that contributes to endothelial dysfunction and subsequent erectile dysfunction. Current therapies do not ameliorate oxidative stress so targeting oxidative stress may improve erectile dysfunction. Resveratrol and MitoQ are two prospective drugs that have antioxidant-like properties and may be useful to improve erectile dysfunction induced by androgen deprivation.  Materials and methods:   We castrated 12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice and performed an eight-week intervention with oral delivery of resveratrol or MitoQ at low and high doses. We assessed vascular reactivity of the corpus cavernosum and internal pudendal arteries (IPA) through dose-dependent responses to vasodilatory, vasocontractile, and neurogenic stimuli in a myograph system. We performed qRT-PCR to measure expression changes of 18 antioxidant genes in the corpus cavernosum.  Key findings:   Castration significantly impaired erectile function via impaired endothelial-dependent and-independent relaxation, and increased constriction of the corpus cavernosum, and induced severe endothelial dysfunction of the IPA. Castration decreased expression of 8 of the antioxidant genes investigated. Resveratrol and MitoQ were ineffective in reversing the effects of androgen deprivation on vascular reactivity, however high-dose resveratrol treatment upregulated several key antioxidant genes, including Cat, Sod1, Gstm1, and Prdx3.  Significance:   Our findings suggest that oral resveratrol and MitoQ treatment may provide protection to the corpus cavernosum under androgen deprived conditions by stimulating endogenous antioxidant systems. However, they may need to be paired with vasoactive drugs to reverse erectile dysfunction under androgen deprived conditions.""","""['Clifford J Pierre', 'Tooyib A Azeez', 'Michael L Rossetti', 'Bradley S Gordon', 'Justin D La Favor']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Functional and structural changes in internal pudendal arteries underlie erectile dysfunction induced by androgen deprivation.', 'Castration impairs erectile organ structure and function by inhibiting autophagy and promoting apoptosis of corpus cavernosum smooth muscle cells in rats.', 'Low androgen status inhibits erectile function by upregulating the expression of proteins of mitochondria-associated membranes in rat corpus cavernosum.', 'The physiological role of androgens in penile erection: regulation of corpus cavernosum structure and function.', 'Weapons of penile smooth muscle destruction: androgen deficiency promotes accumulation of adipocytes in the corpus cavernosum.', 'Erectile Dysfunction: Treatments, Advances and New Therapeutic Strategies.', 'Uncovering the genetic links of diabetic erectile dysfunction and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome.']"""

Androgen deprivation therapy is initially effective in most instances of AR-positive advanced or metastatic PCa. However, patients inevitably develop lethal castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), which is also resistant to the next-generation AR signaling inhibitors. Most CRPCs maintain AR expression, and blocking AR signaling remains a main therapeutic approach. GATA2 is a pioneer transcription factor emerging as a key therapeutic target for PCa because it promotes AR expression and activation. While directly inhibiting GATA2 transcriptional activity remains challenging, enhancing GATA2 degradation is a plausible therapeutic strategy. How GATA2 protein stability is regulated in PCa remains unknown. Here, we show that constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, drives GATA2 ubiquitination at K419/K424 for degradation. GATA2 lacks a conserved [D/E](x)xxVP[D/E] degron but uses alternate BR1/BR2 motifs to bind COP1. By promoting GATA2 degradation, COP1 inhibits AR expression and activation and represses PCa cell and xenograft growth and castration resistance. Accordingly, GATA2 overexpression or COP1 mutations that disrupt COP1-GATA2 binding block COP1 tumor-suppressing activities. We conclude that GATA2 is a major COP1 substrate in PCa and that COP1 promotion of GATA2 degradation is a direct mechanism for regulating AR expression and activation, PCa growth, and castration resistance.""","""['Tao Shen', 'Bingning Dong', 'Yanling Meng', 'David D Moore', 'Feng Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['MAPK4 promotes prostate cancer by concerted activation of androgen receptor and AKT.', 'Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'LINC00675 activates androgen receptor axis signaling pathway to promote castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.', 'Shaping Chromatin States in Prostate Cancer by Pioneer Transcription Factors.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cooperative activation of PDK1 and AKT by MAPK4 enhances cancer growth and resistance to therapy.', 'A GATA2-CDC6 axis modulates androgen receptor blockade-induced senescence in prostate cancer.', 'Integrative analysis of the ST6GALNAC family identifies GATA2-upregulated ST6GALNAC5 as an adverse prognostic biomarker promoting prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Role of B7 family members in glioma: Promising new targets for tumor immunotherapy.']"""

Here we perform the first study integrating whole-genome 5hmC with DNA, 5mC, and transcriptome sequencing in clinical samples of benign, localized, and advanced prostate cancer. 5hmC is shown to mark activation of cancer drivers and downstream targets. Furthermore, 5hmC sequencing revealed profoundly altered cell states throughout the disease course, characterized by increased proliferation, oncogenic signaling, dedifferentiation, and lineage plasticity to neuroendocrine and gastrointestinal lineages. Finally, 5hmC sequencing of cell-free DNA from patients with metastatic disease proved useful as a prognostic biomarker able to identify an aggressive subtype of prostate cancer using the genes TOP2A and EZH2, previously only detectable by transcriptomic analysis of solid tumor biopsies. Overall, these findings reveal that 5hmC marks epigenomic activation in prostate cancer and identify hallmarks of prostate cancer progression with potential as biomarkers of aggressive disease.

This study attempts to propose a methodological approach using reliable change index (RCI), a statistical metric to determine the reliability of quantitative biomarker changes by accounting for the baseline measurement standard error, in delta-radiomics. The use of RCI was demonstrated with the MRI data acquired from a group of prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated by 1.5 T MRI-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT).  Methods:   Fifty consecutive PCa patients who underwent five-fractionated MRgRT were retrospectively included, and 1023 radiomics features were extracted from the clinical target volume (CTV) and planning target volume (PTV). The two MRI datasets acquired at the first fraction (MRI11 and MRI21) were used to calculate the baseline feature reliability against image acquisition using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The RCI was constructed based on the baseline feature measurement standard deviation, ICC, and feature value differences at two time points between the fifth (MRI51) and the first fraction MRI (MRI11). The reliable change of features was determined in each patient only if the calculated RCI was over 1.96 or smaller than -1.96. The feature changes between MRI51 and MRI11 were correlated to two patient-reported quality-of-life clinical endpoints of urinary domain summary score (UDSS) and bowel domain summary score (BDSS) in 35 patients using the Spearman correlation test. Only the significant correlations between a feature that was reliably changed in ‚â•7 patients (20%) by RCI and an endpoint were considered as true significant correlations.  Results:   The 352 (34.4%) and 386 (37.7%) features among all 1023 features were determined by RCI to be reliably changed in more than five (10%) patients in the CTV and PTV, respectively. Nineteen features were found reliably changed in the CTV and 31 features in the PTV, respectively, in 10 (20%) or more patients. These features were not necessarily associated with significantly different longitudinal feature values (group p-value < 0.05). Most reliably changed features in more than 10 patients had excellent or good baseline test-retest reliability ICC, while none showed poor reliability. The RCI method ruled out the features to be reliably changed when substantial feature measurement bias was presented. After applying the RCI criterion, only four and five true significant correlations were confirmed with UDSS and BDSS in the CTV, respectively, with low true significance correlation rates of 10.8% (4/37) and 17.9% (5/28). No true significant correlations were found in the PTV.  Conclusions:   The RCI method was proposed for delta-radiomics and demonstrated using PCa MRgRT data. The RCI has advantages over some other statistical metrics commonly used in the previous delta-radiomics studies, and is useful to reliably identify the longitudinal radiomics feature change on an individual basis. This proposed RCI method should be helpful for the development of essential feature selection methodology in delta-radiomics.""","""['Cindy Xue', 'Winnie C W Chu', 'Jing Yuan', 'Darren M C Poon', 'Bin Yang', 'Yihang Zhou', 'Siu Ki Yu', 'Kin Yin Cheung']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Reliability of MRI radiomics features in MR-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer: Repeatability, reproducibility, and within-subject agreement.', 'A pilot study of MRI radiomics for high-risk prostate cancer stratification in 1.5 T MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Longitudinal acquisition repeatability of MRI radiomics features: An ACR MRI phantom study on two MRI scanners using a 3D T1W TSE sequence.', 'Radiomics feature reliability assessed by intraclass correlation coefficient: a systematic review.', 'Beyond diagnosis: is there a role for radiomics in prostate cancer management?']"""

Prior research demonstrates U.S. immigrants have low rates of guideline-concordant breast and colorectal screening, but prostate cancer screening has not previously been evaluated. We sought to characterize screening behaviors among U.S. immigrants and to consider possible mechanisms to enhance PSA-based screening for this population.  Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from the 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2018 National Health Interview Survey reports, which were the recent survey years that included questions about PSA testing. Complex samples logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between immigrant-specific characteristics including region of birth, citizenship status, length of residence within the U.S., English language proficiency, and history of PSA testing.  Results:   There were 22,997 survey respondents; 3,257 were foreign-born and 19,740 were U.S.-born. Rates of PSA testing were much lower among the foreign-born population compared to the U.S.-born population (43% vs 60%). Citizenship status, length of residence in the U.S. for more than 15 years, and English proficiency were directly linked to increased rates of PSA testing. There was significant variability in PSA testing among immigrant subgroups and Asian immigrants had the lowest rate of PSA testing. Annual physician visits and English language proficiency were associated with increased PSA testing among the U.S. immigrant population.  Conclusions:   Immigrants have relatively low rates of PSA testing. Improving health care utilization and language services may help to narrow the gap in guideline-concordant prostate cancer screening between immigrants and nonimmigrants.""","""['Nathaniel F Hansen', 'Joshua A Linscott', 'Matthew H Hayn', 'Stephen T Ryan', 'Jesse D Sammon']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'PSA Testing in U.S. Immigrants.', 'Citizenship, length of stay, and screening for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in women, 2000-2010.', 'Associations of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Testing in the US Population: Results from a National Cross-Sectional Survey.', 'Low-Value Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Males.', 'Benefits and Harms of Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence Update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: an evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.']"""

The androgen receptor (AR) pathway is essential for PCa tumorigenesis and inflammatory response. However, little is known about the AR-regulated NACHT, LRR, and PYD domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway in human PCa. In this study, we explored the expression of inflammatory cytokine and AR in high-grade PCa and observed that NLRP3 inflammasome-associated genes were upregulated in high-grade PCa compared with that in low-grade PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia and were associated with AR expression. In addition, we identified circAR-3-a circRNA derived from the AR gene-which is involved in the AR-regulated inflammatory response and cell proliferation by activating the NLRP3 inflammatory pathway. While circAR-3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and the inflammatory response, its depletion induced opposite effects. Mechanistically, we noted that circAR-3 mediated the acetylation modification of NLRP3 by KAT2B and then promoted NLRP3 inflammasome complex subcellular distribution and assembly. Disturbing NLRP3 acetylation or blocking inflammasome assembly with an inhibitor suppressed the progression of PCa xenograft tumors.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression profiles and biofunctions of CLCs genes, and construct a novel risk signature to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa patients. We identified five differentially expressed CLCs genes in our cohort and then constructed a signature composed of CLCN2 and CLCN6 through Lasso-Cox regression analysis in the training cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The testing and entire cohorts from TCGA and the GSE21034 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were used as internal and independent external validation datasets. This signature could divide PCa patients into the high and low risk groups with different prognoses, was apparently correlated with clinical features, and was an independent excellent prognostic indicator. Enrichment analysis indicated our signature was primarily concentrated in cellular process and metabolic process. The expression patterns of CLCN2 and CLCN6 were detected in our own cohort based immunohistochemistry staining, and we found CLCN2 and CLCN6 were highly expressed in PCa tissues compared with benign tissues and positively associated with higher Gleason score and shorter BCR-free time. Functional experiments revealed that CLCN2 and CLCN6 downregulation inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion, and migration, but prolonged cell cycle and promoted apoptosis. Furthermore, Seahorse assay showed that silencing CLCN2 or CLCN6 exerted potential inhibitory effects on energy metabolism in PCa. Collectively, our signature could provide a novel and robust strategy for the prognostic evaluation and improve treatment decision making for PCa patients.""","""['Yong Luo', 'Xiaopeng Liu', 'Xiaoxiao Li', 'Weide Zhong', 'Jingbo Lin', 'Qingbiao Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['Construction and Validation of a Robust Cancer Stem Cell-Associated Gene Set-Based Signature to Predict Early Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and validation of novel inflammatory response-related gene signature to predict prostate cancer recurrence and response to immune checkpoint therapy.', 'Epigenetic signature of Gleason score and prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'A potential panel of four-long noncoding RNA signature in prostate cancer predicts biochemical recurrence-free survival and disease-free survival.', 'A novel 13 RNA binding proteins (RBPs) signature could predict prostate cancer biochemical recurrence.']"""

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been the biomarker of choice for screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, inefficiencies exist with its diagnostic capabilities. This study thus evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic potential of urinary PCA3 as an alternative biomarker for prostate cancer in the Ghanaian population.  Methods:   A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at the Urology Department of the 37 Military Hospital, Accra, Ghana. A total of 237 participants aged 40 years and above with any form of suspected prostate disorder were recruited into the study after written informed consent was obtained. Total serum PSA levels was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method and transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic core needle biopsies were obtained from each study participant. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracies of serum PSA, DRE, and PCA3 as diagnostic tools for prostate cancer. These three diagnostic tools were also evaluated in various combinations to ascertain the combinations with the best diagnostic accuracy.  Results:   Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 26.6% of the participants. Benign prostate hyperplasia and prostatitis were diagnosed in 48.5% and 24.9% participants, respectively. DRE had a sensitivity of 93.7% and a specificity of 12.1%. PSA had a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 16.1%. PCA3 had a sensitivity of 57.1% and a specificity of 85.6% and showed a better accuracy (AUC = 83.0) compared to PSA (AUC = 60.0) and DRE (AUC = 65.0) as individual diagnostic tools. The combination of DRE+PCA3 score had the best diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.80) with a sensitivity and specificity of 60.3% and 80.5%, respectively.  Conclusion:   The urinary PCA3 assay showed a better diagnostic performance compared to serum PSA and DRE. PCA3 as a stand-alone and in combination with DRE could be a suitable complimentary marker in diagnosis and management of prostate cancer.""","""['Bismark Opoku Mensah', 'Linda Ahenkorah Fondjo', 'W K B A Owiredu', 'Ben Adusei']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['The added value of percentage of free to total prostate-specific antigen, PCA3, and a kallikrein panel to the ERSPC risk calculator for prostate cancer in prescreened men.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate can improve the predictive value of the urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 test in patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and a previous negative biopsy.', 'A comparative performance analysis of total prostate-specific antigen, percentage free prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific antigen velocity and urinary prostate cancer gene 3 in the first, second and third repeat prostate biopsy.', 'Urinary Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 as a Tumour Marker: Biochemical and Clinical Aspects.', 'The novel prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) biomarker.']"""

Calcium signaling is implicated in the progression of prostate cancer and plays a critical role in immune cell function. However, whether specific calcium channel-related genes play a crucial role in the immune cell infiltration levels of prostate cancer requires further research. In this study, we performed an integrated analysis of transcriptional, clinical, and somatic mutation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and identified the hub calcium channel-related gene P2RX2 to be associated with the prognosis and immune infiltration of prostate cancer. P2RX2 expression was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration levels and the expression of immune checkpoint genes, and downregulation of P2RX2 led to poor survival in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, we validated the molecular and clinical characteristics of P2RX2 by using multiple databases and conducting in-vitro experiments. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis revealed that patients with low P2RX2 expression were sensitive to docetaxel and Bicalutamide.

Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in PCa. The traditional early detection and prediction approaches cannot differentiate between the different stages of PCa. Therefore, new biomarkers are necessary for early detection and clear differentiation of PCa stages to provide precise therapeutic intervention.  Methods:   The objective of the study was to find significant differences in genes and combine the three GEO datasets with TCGA-PRAD datasets (DEG). Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) determined the gene set and PCa clinical feature correlation module utilizing the TGGA-PRAD clinical feature data. The correlation module genes were rescreened using the biological information analysis tools, with the three hub genes (TOP2A, NCAPG, and BUB1B) for proper verification. Finally, internal (TCGA) and external (GSE32571, GSE70770) validation datasets were used to validate and predict the value of last hub genes.  Results:   The hub gene was abnormally upregulated in PCa samples during verification. The expression of each gene was favorably connected with the Gleason score and TN tumor grade in clinical samples but negatively correlated with the overall survival rate. The expression of these genes was linked to CD8 naive cells and macrophages, among other cells. Antitumor immune cells like NK and NKT were favorably and adversely correlated with infiltrating cells, respectively. Simultaneously, the GSCV and GSEA indicated that the hub gene is connected with cell proliferation, death, and androgen receptor, among other signaling pathways. Therefore, these genes could influence the incidence and progression of PCa by participating in or modulating various signaling pathways. Furthermore, using the online tool of CMap, we examined the individual medications for Hughes and determined that tipifarnib could be useful for the clinical therapy of PCa.  Conclusion:   TOP2A, NCAPG, and BUB1B are important genes intimately linked to the clinical prognosis of PCa and can be employed as reliable biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis. Moreover, these genes can provide a theoretical basis for precision differentiation and treatment of PCa.""","""['Wenxuan Wang', 'Qinghui Wu', 'Ali Mohyeddin', 'Yousheng Liu', 'Zhitao Liu', 'Jianqiang Ge', 'Bao Zhang', 'Gan Shi', 'Weifu Wang', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Fei Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Math Methods Med""","""['Environmental Phenol and Paraben Exposure Risks and Their Potential Influence on the Gene Expression Involved in the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of UBE2C as hub gene in driving prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified hub genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Random forest-based modelling to detect biomarkers for prostate cancer progression.', 'Identification of hub genes in prostate cancer using robust rank aggregation and weighted gene co-expression network analysis.']"""

However, further work is needed to better define those patients that are at an elevated risk of such metastasis.  Methods:   SEER and TCGA databases were searched to develop a nomogram for predicting prostate cancer bone metastasis.  Results:   Herein, we leveraged the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to construct a predictive nomogram capable of readily and accurately predicted the odds of bone metastasis in prostate cancer patients. This nomogram was utilized to assign patients with prostate cancer included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to cohorts at a high or low risk of bone metastasis (HRBM and LRBM, respectively). Comparisons of these LRBM and HRBM cohorts revealed marked differences in mutational landscapes between these patient cohorts, with increased frequencies of gene fusions, somatic copy number variations (CNVs), and single nucleotide variations (SNVs), particularly in the P53 gene, being evident in the HRBM cohort. We additionally identified lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs that were differentially expressed between these two patient cohorts and used them to construct a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. Moreover, three weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) modules were constructed from the results of these analyses, with KIF14, MYH7, and COL10A1 being identified as hub genes within these modules. We further found immune response activity levels in the HRBM cohort to be elevated relative to that in the LRBM cohort, with single sample gene enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) scores for the immune checkpoint signature being increased in HRBM patient samples relative to those from LRBM patients.

Methods:   Aged human prostate peripheral zone (PZ) and transitional zone (TZ) tissues were used for single-cell RNA-sequencing. Results were validated by immunofluorescence staining.  Results:   We found that club/hillock epithelial cells, compared with other epithelial cells, had significantly higher NOTCH signaling activity and expressed higher levels of neuro-stems but lower androgen-related genes. These cells were primarily found in the TZ and provided a stem-like niche around the proximal prostate ducts. Significant heterogeneity was observed in the aged luminal population. A novel TFF3+ luminal subtype with elevated MYC and E2F pathway activities was observed, primarily in the PZ. Further analysis revealed that epithelial cells in the TZ had higher levels of stem- and inflammation-related pathway activities but lower androgen/lineage-related pathway activities than those in the PZ. Notably, the activation of MYC, E2F and DNA repair pathways significantly increased in PZ luminal cells. In the immune landscape, we found that the immune microenvironment in the TZ is more complex and disordered with more infiltration of NK and Treg cells. CD8 T cell and macrophage in the TZ exhibit both inflammation activation and suppression phenotypes. In the stroma, the TZ had a higher fibroblast density, and fibroblasts in the TZ exhibited stronger transcriptome activity in immunity and proliferation. Ligand-receptor interaction analysis revealed that fibroblasts could contribute to a NOTCH signaling niche for club/hillock cells in the TZ and balance the prostate immune microenvironment. The activation of stem properties, inflammatory infiltration and loss of androgen/lineage activity are prominent features distinguishing the TZ from PZ.

The relationship between CD276 and miR-187 in prostate cancer was evaluated. Following miR-187 mimic/inhibitor or CD276 overexpression transfection, their actions in prostate cancer cell biological processes were analyzed. Prostate cancer cells were then exposed to BMSC-exos that were treated with either miR-187 mimic/inhibitor or CD276 overexpression for pinpointing the in vitro and in vivo effects of exosomal miR-187. miR-187 was poorly expressed while CD276 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer. Additionally, restoring miR-187 inhibited the prostate cancer cell malignant properties by targeting CD276. Upregulation of miR-187 led to declines in CD276 expression and the JAK3-STAT3-Slug signaling pathway. Next, BMSC-exos carrying miR-187 contributed to repressed cell malignant features as well as limited tumorigenicity and tumor metastasis.

Objective This study was aimed to find role of real time transrectal elastography of prostate for detection of prostate cancer. Method Study was conducted in 66 patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer, who were sent for ultrasound guided prostate biopsy. Transrectal ultrasound with real time elastography was performed in all the patients prior to the biopsy and looked for hard areas within the prostate. Then six-core tru-cut biopsy were taken in six zones of prostate, including the hard areas detected in the elastography. The histopathology report were correlated with the elastography findings. Result Median prostate specific antigen of the patients was 11.5 ng/ml with interquartile range of 8 to 23.5 ng/ml. Digital rectal examination showed hard nodular findings in 35 patients.

We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using conditional logistic regression models stratified by 5-year age groups and study, adjusting for potential confounders. Potential interactions with exposure to other occupational agents were also explored.  Results:   Overall, we found no association for ever occupational heat exposure (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.87, 1.09), nor in the highest categories of lifetime cumulative exposure (OR 1.04; 95% CI 0.89, 1.23) or duration (OR 1.03; 95% CI 0.88, 1.22). When using only the Spanish case-control study and a Spanish Job Exposure Matrix (JEM), some weakly elevated ORs were observed.  Conclusions:   Findings from this study provide no clear evidence for an association between occupational heat exposure and prostate cancer risk.""","""['Alice Hinchliffe', 'Juan Alguacil', 'Wendy Bijoux', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Florence Menegaux', 'Marie-Elise Parent', 'Beatriz P√©rez Gomez', 'Sanni Uuksulainen', 'Michelle C Turner']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Association of occupational heat exposure and colorectal cancer in the MCC-Spain study.', 'Occupational Heat Exposure and Breast Cancer Risk in the MCC-Spain Study.', 'Occupational exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and the risk of prostate cancer.', 'Occupational exposure to lead and lung cancer: results from two case-control studies in Montreal, Canada.', 'Use of the Finnish Information System on Occupational Exposure (FINJEM) in epidemiologic, surveillance, and other applications.']"""

The second aim was to compare the optimized Pix2Pix model with five other architectures (bulk-density, atlas-based, patch-based, U-Net, and GAN).  Methods:   For 39 patients treated by VMAT for prostate cancer, T2-weighted MRI images were acquired in addition to CT images for treatment planning. sCT images were generated using the Pix2Pix model. The generator, loss function, and hyper-parameters were tuned to improve sCT image generation (in terms of imaging endpoints). The final evaluation was performed by 3-fold cross-validation. This method was compared to five other methods using the following imaging endpoints: the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error (ME) between sCT and reference CT images (rCT) of the whole pelvis, bones, prostate, bladder, and rectum. For dose planning analysis, the dose-volume histogram metric differences and 3D gamma analysis (local, 1 %/1 mm) were calculated using the sCT and reference CT images.  Results:   Compared with the other architectures, Pix2Pix with Perceptual loss function and generator ResNet 9 blocks showed the lowest MAE (29.5, 107.7, 16.0, 13.4, and 49.1 HU for the whole pelvis, bones, prostate, bladder, and rectum, respectively) and the highest gamma passing rates (99.4 %, using the 1 %/1mm and 10 % dose threshold criterion). Concerning the DVH points, the mean errors were -0.2% for the planning target volume V95%, 0.1 % for the rectum V70Gy, and -0.1 % for the bladder V50Gy.

The aim of this study was to determine the blood serum concentration of collagen IV, laminin-5 and fibronectin in bladder cancer patients. Quantification of their concentrations and correlation with various clinicopathological parameters may be useful for making more accurate predictions and identifying high-risk patients. The study included 96 patients with bladder cancer confirmed by transurethral resection or cystectomy and 26 patients with diagnosed cystitis chronica or BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia). Collagen IV, laminin-5 and fibronectin were detected using Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging biosensors. Significant differences in blood serum concentrations of the studied biomarkers were observed between the control group and bladder cancer patients, as well as between nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive groups. ROC analysis gave satisfactory results for differentiation between the control group and bladder cancer group (AUC 0.92-0.99), with lower values only for collagen IV between nonmuscle-invasive and muscle-invasive patients (AUC 0.71), and a statistically insignificant difference for laminin-5. Laminin-5 concentration was more closely correlated to tumour grade, size and recurrence rate; fibronectin to tumour stage, size and morphology; and collagen IV to tumour stage, grade and recurrence rate.

Arglabin, a sesquiterpene lactone isolated from Artemisia glabella was cytotoxic to different human cancer cell lines including those derived from advanced triple-negative breast, lung, androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate carcinomas. Noteworthy, arglabin was less toxic to non-neoplastic prostate epithelial cells indicating selectivity for cancer cells. At the molecular level, prior to any biochemical signs of cellular toxicity, arglabin reduced levels of cell-surface sulphanyl groups and inhibited phosphorylation of the redox-sensitive receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR, the only active RTK in PC-3 prostate cancer cells among 49 TRKs analyzed by the assay. Henceforth, arglabin inhibited the EGFR downstream signaling pathways mTORC1 and mTORC2. Accordingly, arglabin induced autophagosome formation and autophagic flux, inhibited phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K1) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), and impeded cell cycle progression and proliferation of PC-3 cells. In agreement with inhibition of the mTORC2 pathway, arglabin induced sustained actin polymerization, inhibited cell migration, and triggered apoptosis in vitro in 2D cell culture and colony formation assay and in vivo in prostate cancer xenografts grown on chick chorioallantoic membranes. Under physiological conditions, arglabin rapidly formed adducts with reduced glutathione (GSH). Moreover, thiol-based antioxidants GSH and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol abolished arglabin-induced cancer cell toxicity, whereas the non-thiol antioxidant trolox was ineffective pointing to a crucial role of interaction with cell-surface sulphanyl groups for arglabin cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.""","""['Menna El Gaafary', 'Samy A F Morad', 'Michael Schmiech', 'Tatiana Syrovets', 'Thomas Simmet']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Combination of mTOR and EGFR kinase inhibitors blocks mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activity and suppresses the progression of colorectal carcinoma.', 'Regulation of androgen receptor transcriptional activity by rapamycin in prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival.', 'MP470, a novel receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in combination with Erlotinib inhibits the HER family/PI3K/Akt pathway and tumor growth in prostate cancer.', 'Diverse signaling mechanisms of mTOR complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2 in forming a formidable relationship.', 'Discrete signaling mechanisms of mTORC1 and mTORC2: Connected yet apart in cellular and molecular aspects.']"""

They are secreted in various biological fluids, including airway nasal mucus. The goal of this work was to understand the role of sEVs present in the mucus (mu-sEVs) produced by human nasal epithelial cells (HNECs) in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that uninfected HNECs produce mu-sEVs containing SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 and activated protease TMPRSS2. mu-sEVs cleave prefusion viral Spike proteins at the S1/S2 boundary, resulting in higher proportions of prefusion S proteins exposing their receptor binding domain in an 'open' conformation, thereby facilitating receptor binding at the cell surface. We show that the role of nasal mu-sEVs is to complete prefusion Spike priming performed by intracellular furin during viral egress from infected cells. This effect is mediated by vesicular TMPRSS2 activity, rendering SARS-CoV-2 virions prone to entry into target cells using the 'early', TMPRSS2-dependent pathway instead of the 'late', cathepsin-dependent route. These results indicate that prefusion Spike priming by mu-sEVs in the nasal cavity plays a role in viral tropism.

Results:   In PCSs, a lower most-recent level of prostate-specific antigen and higher cancer-specific self-efficacy were associated with better psychological resilience. Further, fewer hormonal, bowel and urinary symptoms and bother; higher cancer-specific self-efficacy; and better psychological resilience were associated with less demoralisation. Cancer-specific self-efficacy was a mediator for the relationship between urinary symptoms and bother and demoralisation, while psychological resilience mediated the relationship between cancer-specific self-efficacy and demoralisation.

Results:   Seven patients already had metastatic cancer at the time of diagnosis, and all 12 patients had Gleason grade ‚â• 4. Most cases of biallelic loss or potentially biallelic loss were metastatic cancers at the initial staging, and all these cases were categorized into Gleason grade 5. Two of the 12 patients had BRCA2/RB1 co-loss, and the other two had whole genome duplication. Five patients had a long-term survival of > 6 years, but two patients died within 4 years of diagnosis.

We were unable to find any study that explicitly examined the properties of this threshold compared with others.  Objective:   To investigate whether the 0.15 cutoff is justified for selecting patients at risk of harboring high-grade cancer (Gleason score ‚â•3 + 4) despite negative MRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort of 8974 prostate biopsies provided by the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group (PBCG) was included in the study.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing was used to investigate whether there was a change in the risk of high-grade cancer around this value. We examined whether the use of this cutoff in patients with negative MRI corresponds to a reasonable threshold probability for a biopsy (defined as a 10% risk of high-grade disease). To do so, we applied the negative likelihood ratio of MRI, calculated from eight studies on prostate MRI, to the risk curve derived from the PBCG.  Results and limitations:   There was no discontinuity in the risk of high-grade prostate cancer at a PSAd cutoff of 0.15. This cutoff corresponded to a probability of high-grade disease ranging from 2.6% to 10%, depending on MRI accuracy. Using 10% as threshold probability, the corresponding PSAd cutoff varied between 0.15 and 0.38, with the threshold increasing for greater MRI accuracy. Possible limitations include difference between studies on MRI and the use of ultrasound to measure prostate volume.  Conclusions:   The 0.15 cutoff to recommend prostate biopsies in patients with negative MRI is justified only under an extreme scenario of poor MRI properties. We recommend a value of at least ‚â•0.20. Our results suggest the need for future studies to look at how to best identify patients who need prostate biopsies despite negative MRI, likely by using individualized risk prediction.  Patient summary:   In this study, we investigated whether the commonly used prostate-specific antigen density cutoff of 0.15 is justified to identify patients with negative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who should proceed to a prostate biopsy. We found that this cutoff is appropriate only in case of very poor MRI quality, and a higher cutoff (‚â•0.20) should be used for the average MRI.""","""['Francesco Pellegrino', 'Amy L Tin', 'Alberto Martini', 'Emily A Vertosick', 'Shaun P Porwal', 'Armando Stabile', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'James A Eastham', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Andrew J Vickers']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Prebiopsy Biparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Combined with Prostate-specific Antigen Density in Detecting and Ruling out Gleason 7-10 Prostate Cancer in Biopsy-na√Øve Men.', 'How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-na√Øve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009‚â§\u20093?', 'Prediction of High-grade Prostate Cancer Following Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Improving the Rotterdam European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer Risk Calculators.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Developing a predictive model for clinically significant prostate cancer by combining age, PSA density, and mpMRI.']"""

Herein, we investigate the impact of ADT sequencing for men receiving ADT with prostate-only RT (PORT) or whole-pelvis RT (WPRT).  Materials and methods:   Individual patient data from 12 randomized trials that included patients receiving neoadjuvant/concurrent or concurrent/adjuvant short-term ADT (4-6 months) with RT for localized disease were obtained from the Meta-Analysis of Randomized trials in Cancer of the Prostate consortium. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was performed with propensity scores derived from age, initial prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, T stage, RT dose, and mid-trial enrollment year. Metastasis-free survival (primary end point) and overall survival (OS) were assessed by IPTW-adjusted Cox regression models, analyzed independently for men receiving PORT versus WPRT. IPTW-adjusted Fine and Gray competing risk models were built to evaluate distant metastasis (DM) and prostate cancer-specific mortality.

With PORT (n = 4,355), compared with neoadjuvant/concurrent ADT, concurrent/adjuvant ADT was associated with improved metastasis-free survival (10-year benefit 8.0%, hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.79; P < .0001), DM (subdistribution HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.82; P = .0046), prostate cancer-specific mortality (subdistribution HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.54; P < .0001), and OS (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.83; P = .0001). However, in patients receiving WPRT (n = 3,049), no significant difference in any end point was observed in regard to ADT sequencing except for worse DM (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.05; P = .0009) with concurrent/adjuvant ADT.  Conclusion:   ADT sequencing exhibits a significant impact on clinical outcomes with a significant interaction with field size. Concurrent/adjuvant ADT should be the standard of care where short-term ADT is indicated in combination with PORT.""","""['Ting Martin Ma', 'Yilun Sun', 'Shawn Malone', 'Mack Roach rd', 'David Dearnaley', 'Thomas M Pisansky', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Howard M Sandler', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Isabel Syndikus', 'Emma C Hall', 'Alison C Tree', 'Matthew R Sydes', 'Claire Cruickshank', 'Soumyajit Roy', 'Michel Bolla', 'Philippe Maingon', 'Theo De Reijke', 'Abdenour Nabid', 'Nathalie Carrier', 'Luis Souhami', 'Almudena Zapatero', 'Araceli Guerrero', 'Ana Alvarez', 'Carmen Gonzalez San-Segundo', 'Xavier Maldonado', 'Tahmineh Romero', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Luca F Valle', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Jonathan E Shoag', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Nicholas G Zaorsky', 'Angela Y Jia', 'Jorge A Garcia', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Amar U Kishan;Meta-Analysis of Randomized Trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium Investigators']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Regarding Sequencing of Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'Prostate Radiotherapy With Adjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) Improves Metastasis-Free Survival Compared to Neoadjuvant ADT: An Individual Patient Meta-Analysis.', 'The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Effect of whole pelvic radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors in Addition to Docetaxel with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Designing, analyzing, and interpreting observational studies of physical activity and cancer outcomes from a clinical oncology perspective.', 'Using a Further Planning MRI after Neoadjuvant Androgen Deprivation Therapy Significantly Reduces the Radiation Exposure of Organs at Risk in External Beam Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Forty-five high-risk prostate cancer patients with bone metastases were enrolled prospectively and underwent whole-body MRI sequences, which included the following: pre- and post-contrast CSI-T1W-Dixon and conventional multi-planar T1-Weighted Dixon (CMP-T1W-Dixon) (coronal, sagittal, and axial scans), short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and DWI. Comparison between the CMP-T1W-Dixon and CSI-T1W-Dixon images was done for the subjective image quality, the quantitative contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Furthermore, the diagnostic performance based on per-lesion and per-patient basis utilizing non-contrast T1-weighted (T1)/T1+ contrasted T1-weighted (T1C)/T1 + T1C + STIR + DWI sequences was compared between the CSI-T1W-Dixon and CMP-T1W-Dixon methods using reference standards (combining biopsy data and 6-month imaging follow-up).  Result:   The CSI-T1W-Dixon images produced fewer image artifacts in the axial and coronal planes compared to the CMP-T1W-Dixon images. Also, the CSI-T1W-Dixon images provided better a CNR in fat-only images of all three planes and water-only images of the axial plane (p < 0.05). The CSI-T1W-Dixon showed a higher sensitivity than the CMP-T1W-Dixon techniques in analyzing T1-only images on a per-lesion basis (82.7% vs. 53.8% for sensitivity, p = 0.03). On a per-patient basis, no difference was found in the diagnostic capacity between the CSI-T1W-Dixon and CMP-T1W-Dixon sequences either alone or in combinations (p = 0.57-1).  Conclusion:   High-resolution CSI-T1W-Dixon with higher image quality and diagnostic capacity can replace the CMP-T1W-Dixon method in evaluating bone metastasis in clinical practice.  Key points:   ‚Ä¢ Compressed sensing isotropic acquisition for 3D T1-weighted Dixon images can improve the image quality with fewer artifacts compared to the anisotropic multiplanar acquisition. ‚Ä¢ Compressed sensing isotropic acquisition can save 67% of scanning time compared to anisotropic multiplanar acquisition. ‚Ä¢ Compressed sensing isotropic 3D T1-weighted Dixon images can offer better diagnostic performance with higher sensitivity compared to anisotropic multiplanar images.""","""['Zhenhong Liao', 'Gaoyuan Liu', 'Bing Ming', 'Chun Ma', 'Xigang Fan', 'Xiaoyong Zhang', 'Wei Peng', 'Chen Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Whole-body 3D T1-weighted MR imaging in patients with prostate cancer: feasibility and evaluation in screening for metastatic disease.', 'Whole-body MRI in oncology: can a single anatomic T2 Dixon sequence replace the combination of T1 and STIR sequences to detect skeletal metastasis and myeloma?', 'Comparing T1-weighted and T2-weighted three-point Dixon technique with conventional T1-weighted fat-saturation and short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) techniques for the study of the lumbar spine in a short-bore MRI machine.', 'Whole-body MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for patients with recurring prostate cancer: technical feasibility and assessment of lesion conspicuity in DWI.', 'Fast magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in children: the sub-10-min unenhanced scan.']"""

The viable anti-cancer strategies are based on developing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins inhibitors, BH3 mimetics. Our focus in past years has been on the investigating a new potential BH3 mimetic, Hypericin (Hyp). Hyp is a naturally occurring photosensitive compound used in photodynamic therapy and diagnosis. We have demonstrated that Hyp can cause substantial effects in cellular ultrastructure, mitochondria function and metabolism, and distribution of Bcl2 proteins in malignant and non-malignant cells. One of the possible mechanisms of Hyp action could be the direct interactions between Bcl-2 proteins and Hyp. We investigated this assumption by in silico computer modelling and in vitro fluorescent spectroscopy experiments with the small Bcl2 peptide segments designed to correspond to Bcl2 BH3 and BH1 domains. We show here that Hyp interacts with BH3 and BH1 peptides in concentration dependent manner, and shows the stronger interactions than known BH3 mimetics, Gossypol (Goss) and ABT-263. In addition, interactions of Hyp, Goss and ABT263, with whole purified proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 by fluorescence spectroscopy show that Hyp interacts stronger with the Bcl-2 and less with Mcl-1 protein than Goss or ABT-263. This suggest that Hyp is comparable to other BH3 mimetics and could be explore as such. Hyp cytotoxicity was low in human U87 MG glioma, similar to that of ABT263, where Goss exerted sufficient cytotoxicity, suggesting that Hyp acts primarily on Bcl-2, but not on Mcl-1 protein. In combination therapy, low doses of Hyp with Goss effectively decreased U87 MG viability, suggesting a possible synergy effect. Overall, we can conclude that Hyp as BH3 mimetic acts primarily on Bcl-2 protein and can be explored to target cells with Bcl-2 over-expression, or in combination with other BH3 mimetics, that target Mcl-1 or Bcl-XL proteins, in dual therapy.""","""['Anastasia Doroshenko', 'Silvia Tomkova', 'Tibor Kozar', 'Katarina Stroffekova']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Importance of Hypericin-Bcl2 interactions for biological effects at subcellular levels.', 'Binding affinity of pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides for the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 and A1 proteins: Molecular dynamics simulations of Mcl-1 and A1 in complex with six different BH3 peptides.', 'Impact of elevated anti-apoptotic MCL-1 and BCL-2 on the development and treatment of MLL-AF9 AML in mice.', 'The first MCL-1-selective BH3 mimetics have therapeutic potential for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.', 'Recent Advances in Cancer Drug Development: Targeting Induced Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) Differentiation Protein.']"""

Methods:   A total of 284 urine samples were collected from patients after the digital rectal examination (DRE). Urinary exosomes were extracted using commercial kits, and urine-derived exosomal PSMA was determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of PSMA was performed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA), and waterfall plots.  Results:   We found that urine-derived exosomal PSMA was significantly higher in PCa and csPCa than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and BPH + non-aggressive prostate cancer (naPCa) groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the urine-derived exosome PSMA yielded area under the ROC curve (AUC) values of 0.876 and 0.826 for detecting PCa and csPCa, respectively, suggesting better performance than traditional clinical biomarkers. Besides, when the cutoff value used corresponded to a sensitivity of 95%, urine-derived exosomal PSMA could avoid unnecessary biopsies in 41.2% of cases and missed only 0.7% of csPCa cases.

Methods:   A panel of 51 invited medical oncologists and urologists convened in May of 2021 with the aim of discussing and providing recommendations regarding the most relevant issues concerning staging methods, antineoplastic therapy, osteoclast-targeted therapy, and patient follow-up in nmCRPC.

Results:   Key recommendations and findings include the reliance on prostate-specific antigen doubling time for treatment decisions, the absence of a clear preference between conventional and novel (i.e., positron-emission tomography-based) imaging techniques, the increasing role of ARSis in various settings, the general view that ARSis have similar efficacy. Panelists highlighted the slight preference for darolutamide, when safety is of greater concern, and a continued need to develop high-level evidence to guide the intensity of follow-up in this subset of prostate cancer.

This study aimed to define variables that predict whether such lesions are likely malignant or benign using features on PSMA PET/CT. Methods: 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging was performed on 243 consecutive patients with high-risk primary or biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. IBLs identified on PSMA PET/CT could not definitively be interpreted as benign or malignant. Medical records of patients with IBLs were reviewed to determine the ultimate status of each lesion. IBLs were deemed malignant or benign on the basis of evidence of progression or stability at follow-up, respectively, or by biopsy results; IBLs were deemed equivocal when insufficient or unclear evidence existed. Post hoc patient, lesion, and scan variables accounting for clustered data were evaluated using Wilcoxon rank-sum and œá2 tests to determine features that favored benign or malignant interpretation. Results: Overall, 98 IBLs within 267 bone lesions (36.7%) were identified in 48 of 243 patients (19.8%). Thirty-seven of 98 IBLs were deemed benign, and 42 were deemed malignant, of which 8 had histologic verification; 19 remained equivocal. Location and SUVmax categorical variables were predictive of IBL interpretation (P = 0.0201 and P = 0.0230, respectively). For IBLs with new interpretations, 34 of 37 (91.9%) considered benign showed an SUVmax of less than 5 or exhibited focal uptake without coexisting bone metastases; 37 of 42 (88.1%) deemed malignant demonstrated an SUVmax of at least 5 or were present with coexisting bone metastases. Logistic regression predicted IBLs with a high SUVmax (univariable: odds ratio [OR], 9.29 [P = 0.0016]; multivariable: OR, 13.87 [P = 0.0089]) or present with other bone metastases (univariable: OR, 9.87 [P = 0.0112]; multivariable: OR, 11.35 [P = 0.003]) to be malignant. Conclusion: IBLs on PSMA PET/CT are concerning; however, characterizing their location, SUV, and additional scan findings can aid interpretation. IBLs displaying an SUVmax of at least 5 or present with other bone metastases favor malignancy. IBLs without accompanying bone metastases that exhibit an SUVmax of less than 5 and are observed only in atypical locations favor benign processes.

To develop effective treatments toward CR PCa, we investigated reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling pathway for its role involving in CR PCa progression. ROS can regulate both cell growth and apoptosis: a moderate increase of ROS promotes proliferation; its substantial rise results in cell death. p66Shc protein can increase oxidant species production and its elevated level is associated with the androgen-independent (AI) phenotype of CR PCa cells; while heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an antioxidant enzyme and elevated in a sub-group of metastatic PCa cells. In this study, our data revealed that HO-1 and p66Shc protein levels are co-elevated in various AI PCa cell lines as well as p66Shc cDNA-transfected cells. Knockdown and/or inhibition of either p66Shc or HO-1 protein leads to reduced tumorigenicity as well as a reduction of counterpart protein. Knockdown of HO-1 alone results in increased ROS levels, nucleotide and protein oxidation and induction of cell death. Together, our data indicate that elevated HO-1 protein levels protect PCa cells from otherwise apoptotic conditions induced by aberrant p66Shc/ROS production, which thereby promotes PCa progression to the CR phenotype. p66Shc and HO-1 can serve as functional targets for treating CR PCa.""","""['Dannah R Miller', 'Matthew A Ingersoll', 'Yu-Wei Chou', 'Elizabeth A Kosmacek', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan', 'Ming-Fong Lin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Free Radic Biol Med""","""['p66Shc protein through a redox mechanism enhances the progression of prostate cancer cells towards castration-resistance.', 'Reactive oxygen species induced by p66Shc longevity protein mediate nongenomic androgen action via tyrosine phosphorylation signaling to enhance tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells.', 'p66Shc regulates migration of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'p66Shc in Cardiovascular Pathology.', 'p66Shc--a longevity redox protein in human prostate cancer progression and metastasis : p66Shc in cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Pharmacological Significance of Heme Oxygenase 1 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   PRESIDE was a two-period, multinational, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 3b study done at 123 sites in Europe (in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, and the UK). Patients were eligible for period 1 (P1) of the study if they had histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma without neuroendocrine differentiation or small-cell features, serum testosterone concentrations of 1¬∑73 nmol/L or less, and had progressed during androgen deprivation therapy with a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist or after bilateral orchiectomy. In P1, patients received open-label enzalutamide 160 mg per day orally. At week 13, patients were assessed for either radiographic or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression (25% or more increase and 2 ng/mL or more above nadir). Patients who showed any decline in PSA at week 13 and subsequently progressed (radiographic progression, PSA progression, or both) were screened and enrolled in period 2 (P2), during which eligible patients were treated with up to ten cycles of intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks and oral prednisolone 10 mg/day, and randomly assigned (1:1) to oral enzalutamide 160 mg/day or oral placebo. Patients were stratified by type of disease progression. The block size was four and the overall number of blocks was 400. Patients, investigators, and study organisers were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed in all patients in P2. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02288247, and is no longer recruiting.  Findings:   Between Dec 1, 2014, and Feb 15, 2016, 816 patients were screened for P1 of the study. 688 patients were enrolled in P1 and 687 received open-label enzalutamide. In P2, 271 patients were randomly assigned at 73 sites to receive enzalutamide (n=136) or placebo (n=135). The data cutoff for analysis was April 30, 2020. Median progression-free survival with enzalutamide was 9¬∑5 months (95% CI 8¬∑3-10¬∑9) versus 8¬∑3 months (6¬∑3-8¬∑7) with placebo (hazard ratio 0¬∑72 [95% CI 0¬∑53-0¬∑96]; p=0¬∑027).

The most common grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse event in P2 was neutropenia (23 [17%] of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group vs 28 [21%] of 135 patients in the placebo group). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 67 (49%) of 136 patients in the enzalutamide group and 52 (39%) of 135 patients in the placebo group.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is used to treat early stage PC can lead to the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is highly associated with androgen receptor (AR) mutations. Nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1 (NOLC1) is a chaperone that shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Studies suggest that NOLC1 regulates PC progression; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we showed that NOLC1 knockdown suppresses PC cell proliferation by altering the signaling pathways and the expression of various proteins involved in DNA replication, amino acid metabolism, and RNA processing. Mechanistically, NOLC1 knockdown suppressed cell cycle progression by inhibiting AKT phosphorylation and Œ≤-catenin accumulation. Finally, we showed that NOLC1 expression is higher in human PC than in human hyperplastic prostate tissues. Altogether, we demonstrated that NOLC1 knockdown suppresses the progression of both AR-positive and AR-negative PC cells by inducing changes in the expression of several genes leading to cell cycle arrest. Thus, NOLC1 might be a novel and promising therapeutic target for PC.""","""['Wansoo Kim', 'Dong-Yeop Yeo', 'Seong-Kyoon Choi', 'Hee-Yeon Kim', 'Seoung-Woo Lee', 'Janbolat Ashim', 'Jee Eun Han', 'Wookyung Yu', 'Hyohoon Jeong', 'Jin-Kyu Park', 'Song Park']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Increased Akt signaling resulting from the loss of androgen responsiveness in prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the MIF/CXCR7/AKT Signaling Pathway in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Resveratrol inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1Œ±-mediated androgen receptor signaling and represses tumor progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Roles of NOLC1 in cancers and viral infection.']"""

We describe the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative's experience with the use of active surveillance and the short-term oncologic outcomes for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.Materials and Methods:We reviewed the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative registry for men diagnosed with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 2012-2020. The proportion of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer managed with active surveillance was calculated by year of diagnosis. For men selecting active surveillance, the Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate treatment-free survival. To assess for the oncologic safety of active surveillance, we compared the proportion of patients with adverse pathology and biochemical recurrence-free survival between men undergoing delayed radical prostatectomy after a period of active surveillance with men undergoing immediate radical prostatectomy.  Results:   Of the 4,275 men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer, 1,321 (31%) were managed with active surveillance, increasing from 13% in 2012 to 45% in 2020. The 5-year treatment-free probability for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance was 73% for Gleason Grade Group 1 and 57% for Grade Group 2 disease. More men undergoing a delayed radical prostatectomy had adverse pathology (46%) compared with immediate radical prostatectomy (32%, P < .001), yet short-term biochemical recurrence was similar between groups (log-rank test, P = .131).  Conclusions:   The use of active surveillance for men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer has increased markedly. Over half of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance remained free of treatment 5 years after diagnosis. Most men on active surveillance will not lose their window of cure and have similar short-term oncologic outcomes as men undergoing up-front treatment. Active surveillance is an oncologically safe option for appropriately selected men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer.""","""['Roshan Paudel', 'Raghav Madan', 'Ji Qi', 'Stephanie Ferrante', 'Michael L Cher', 'Brian R Lane', 'Arvin K George', 'Alice Semerjian', 'Kevin B Ginsburg']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Does Time Spent on Active Surveillance Adversely Affect the Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Delayed Radical Prostatectomy?', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network¬Æ Favorable Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer-Is Active Surveillance Appropriate?', 'Comparison of Pathological and Oncologic Outcomes of Favorable Risk Gleason Score 3 + 4 and Low Risk Gleason Score 6 Prostate Cancer: Considerations for Active Surveillance.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.']"""

We compared the treatment efficacy of abiraterone with that of combined androgen blockade (CAB) therapy and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone in men with high-risk mHNPC.  Methods:   In total, 146 Japanese men with high-risk mHNPC were retrospectively analyzed.

Patient navigators are trained non-medical personnel who assist patients and caregivers to overcome barriers to accessing health services through care coordination. This trial aims to determine the effectiveness of a patient navigator program in children with CKD.  Methods:   The NAVKIDS2 trial is a multi-center, waitlisted, randomized controlled trial of patient navigators in children with CKD conducted at five sites across Australia. Children (0-16 years) with CKD from low socioeconomic status rural or remote areas were randomized to an intervention group or a waitlisted control group (to receive intervention after 6 months). The study primary and secondary endpoints include the self-rated health (SRH) (primary), and utility-based quality of life, progression of kidney dysfunction of the child, SRH, and satisfaction with healthcare of the caregiver at 6 months post-randomization.  Results:   The trial completed recruitment in October 2021 with expected completion of follow-up by October 2022. There were 162 patients enrolled with 80 and 82 patients randomized to the immediate intervention and waitlisted groups, respectively. Fifty-eight (36%) participants were from regional/remote areas, with a median (IQR) age of 9.5 (5.0, 13.0) years, 46% were of European Australian ethnicity, and 65% were male. A total of 109 children (67%) had CKD stages 1-5, 42 (26%) were transplant recipients, and 11 (7%) were receiving dialysis.

Objective:   To explore the effect of indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) on the proliferation and invasion of PCa cells and the potential mechanism.  Methods:   PCa tissues and normal adjacent tissues were collected from 43 PCa patients. The expression of IDO in PCa tissues and cell lines were detected. The String website was used to search for IDO-related proteins. The GEPIA website was used to analyze the relationship between KYNU and the prognosis of PCa. Cells models of IDO overexpression and/or KYNU silencing were constructed to verify the role of KYNU in regulating PCa. The cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion ability of PCa cells were detected by CCK-8 assay, Flow cytometry and Transwell assay.  Results:   The IDO levels in PCa tissues and cells were higher than those in normal tissues and cells, which promoted the proliferation and invasion of LNCaP cells, and inhibited apoptosis. Silencing IDO inhibited the cells proliferation and invasion activities, and promoted the cell apoptosis. The high expression of KYNU was related to the poor disease free survival of PCa patients. Inhibiting KYUN significantly inhibited the promotion of PCa induced by IDO.

This methodology integrates many of the advantages of global lipid analysis with those of targeted approaches. Having used the method as an initial ""wide class"" screen, it can then be easily adapted for a more targeted analysis and quantification of key, dysregulated lipids. Robustness was assessed using 1550 continuous injections of plasma extracts onto a single column and via the evaluation of columns from 5 different batches of stationary phase. Initial screens in positive (239 lipids, 431 MRM transitions) and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode (232 lipids, 446 MRM transitions) were assessed for reproducibility, sensitivity, and dynamic range using analysis times of 8 min. The total number of lipids monitored using these screening methods was 433 with an overlap of 38 lipids in both modes. A polarity switching method for accurate quantification, using the same LC conditions, was assessed for intra- and interday reproducibility, accuracy, dynamic range, stability, carryover, dilution integrity, and matrix interferences and found to be acceptable.

Hence, this study measured the therapeutic effects of 17Œ≤-oestradiol (E2) and/or progesterone (P4) against azoxymethane-induced CRC in male mice that were divided into (n = 10 mice/group): negative (NC) and positive (PC) controls, E2 (580 ¬µg/Kg/day; five times/week) and P4 (2.9 mg/Kg/day; five times/week) monotherapies, and concurrent (EP) and sequential (E/P) co-therapy groups. Both hormones were injected intraperitoneally to the designated groups for four consecutive weeks. Similar treatment protocols with E2 (10 nM) and/or P4 (20 nM) were also used in the SW480 and SW620 human male CRC cell lines. The PC group showed abundant colonic tumours alongside increased colonic tissue testosterone levels and androgen (AR) and oestrogen (ERŒ±) receptors, whereas E2 and P4 levels with ERŒ≤ and progesterone receptor (PGR) decreased significantly compared with the NC group. E2 and P4 monotherapies equally increased ERŒ≤/PGR with p21/Cytochrome-C/Caspase-3, reduced testosterone levels, inhibited ERŒ±/AR and CCND1/survivin and promoted apoptosis relative to the PC group. Both co-therapy protocols also revealed better anti-cancer effects with enhanced modulation of colonic sex steroid hormones and their receptors, with E/P the most prominent protocol. In vitro, E/P regimen showed the highest increases in the numbers of SW480 (2.1-fold) and SW620 (3.5-fold) cells in Sub-G1 phase of cell cycle. The E/P co-therapy also disclosed the lowest percentages of viable SW480 cells (2.8-fold), whilst both co-therapy protocols equally showed the greatest SW620 apoptotic cell numbers (5.2-fold) relative to untreated cells. Moreover, both co-therapy regimens revealed maximal inhibitions of cell cycle inducers, cell survival markers, and AR/ERŒ± alongside the highest expression of cell cycle suppressors, pro-apoptotic molecules, and ERŒ≤/PGR in both cell lines. In conclusion, CRC was associated with abnormal levels of colonic sex steroid hormones alongside aberrant protein expression of their receptors.

However, it is really challenging to directly analyse these tissues because of a lot of data. Data mining techniques can get around this issue. In order to diagnose prostate cancer via PA spectrum assessment, this work describes the machine learning (ML) technique implementation, such as supervised classification and unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The collected PA signals were preprocessed using Pwelch method, and the features are extracted using two methods such as hierarchical cluster and correlation assessment. The extracted features are classified using four ML-methods, namely, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), decision tree C4.5, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Furthermore, as these components alter throughout the progression of prostate cancer, this study focuses on the composition and distribution of collagen, lipids, and haemoglobin. In diseased tissues compared to normal tissues, there is a stronger correlation between the various chemical components ultrasonic power spectra, suggesting that the microstructural dispersion in tumour tissues has been more uniform. The accuracy of several classifiers used in cancer tissue diagnosis was greater than 94% for all four methods, which is effective than that of benchmark medical methods. Thus, the method shows significant promise for the noninvasive, early detection of severe prostate cancer.""","""['G Ramkumar', 'P Bhuvaneswari', 'R Radhika', 'S Saranya', 'S Vijayalakshmi', 'M Karpagam', 'Florin Wilfred']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Contrast Media Mol Imaging""","""['Prostate cancer identification via photoacoustic spectroscopy and machine learning.', 'Soft Clustering for Enhancing the Diagnosis of Chronic Diseases over Machine Learning Algorithms.', 'Evaluation of supervised machine-learning algorithms to distinguish between inflammatory bowel disease and alimentary lymphoma in cats.', 'A Review on Machine Learning for EEG Signal Processing in Bioengineering.', 'Application of Machine Learning Approaches for the Design and Study of Anticancer Drugs.']"""

Methods:   After IRB approval, we queried the electronic medical records (EMR) to identify patients (ages 18-89) with prostate cancer who were referred for or offered germline testing for prostate cancer from May 1, 2019 to February 24, 2021 through either telephone referral, EMR referral or in-office testing. The 3 cohorts were compared on receipt of testing and time to testing. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox regression evaluated the influence of referral cohort and reason for testing on receipt of testing and time to testing, respectively.  Results:   A total of 184 patients met study inclusion criteria; 47 were referred for germline testing via telephone, 70 were referred through the EMR and 67 were offered testing in the office. No significant demographic or clinical differences were observed. Telephone referral yielded the lowest response (17%; P < 0.001) with the longest time interval between referral and testing (103 days; P < 0.001); in-office testing yielded the highest response (66%). More patients were referred because of both family history and high risk characteristics in the EMR and in-office testing cohorts (21.4% and 25.4% respectively). Referral method was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with receipt of test, while reason for testing was not.

Materials and methods:   Retrospective analysis was performed on a prospectively maintained multicenter PAE database on all patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (January 2014 to July 2016). International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) scores were collected at baseline and within 12 months after the procedure. A logistic regression and nearest neighbor propensity-matched analysis (matched for age, baseline IIEF-5 scores, and use of 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors) and paired t test were used to evaluate for differential impact on IIEF-5 scores between the group of patients who underwent (unilateral) penile collateral coil embolization and a matched control group of patients who did not.  Results:   Of a total of 216 patients, 26 underwent coil protection of an accessory pudendal vessel/penile collateral. After exclusions, 22 propensity-matched pairs were identified. The mean IIEF-5 score at baseline for the coil-embolized group was 14.8 ¬± 8.3 (out of a possible score of 30) and that for the matched control group was 14.0 ¬± 7.8. At the 12-month follow-up after the procedure, the mean follow-up IIEF-5 score was 15.5 ¬± 8.0 for the coil-embolized group and 14.2 ¬± 8.2 for the matched control group. The change in IIEF-5 scores after PAE was not significantly different between the 2 groups (0.66 ¬± 3.8 vs 0.20 ¬± 2.0; P = .64; 95% CI, -1.53 to 2.44).

However, more detailed knowledge on mitochondrial metabolism and metabolic pathways in cancers is still lacking. In this study we expand our previously developed method for analyzing functional homologous proteins (FunHoP), which can provide a more detailed view of metabolic pathways. FunHoP uses results from differential expression analysis of RNA-Seq data to improve pathway analysis. By adding information on subcellular localization based on experimental data and computational predictions we can use FunHoP to differentiate between mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial processes in cancerous and normal prostate cell lines.

Metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells is emerging as an exciting field for cancer therapy. Although the Warburg effect is a common feature of glucose metabolism in many cancers, PC cells have a unique metabolic phenotype. Non-neoplastic prostate cells show reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) because large, accumulated zinc inhibits citrate oxidation. During transformation, there are low levels of zinc in PC cells, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is reactivated. However, metastatic PC exhibits the Warburg effect. Due to metabolic differences in prostate tissue, targeting metabolic alterations in PC cells is an attractive therapeutic strategy. In this study, we investigated the effect of juglone on energy metabolism in PC cells. We found that juglone inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that juglone suppressed OXPHOS and glycolysis due to its inhibition of hexokinase (HK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity. Furthermore, downregulation of PFK and PK, but not HK contributed to the inhibition of these enzyme activities.

Methods:   We examined the serum metabolome in relation to prostate cancer survival in a cohort of 1812 cases in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Using an ultrahigh-performance LC-MS/MS platform, we identified 961 known metabolites in prospectively collected serum. Median survival time from diagnosis to prostate cancer-specific death (N=472) was 6.6 years (interquartile range=2.9-11.1 years). Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of the associations between the serum metabolites (in quartiles) and prostate cancer death, adjusted for age at baseline and diagnosis, disease stage, and Gleason sum. In order to calculate risk scores, we first randomly divided the metabolomic data into a discovery set (70%) and validated in a replication set (30%).  Results:   Overall, 49 metabolites were associated with prostate cancer survival after Bonferroni correction. Notably, higher levels of the phospholipid choline, amino acid glutamate, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n6) arachidonate (20:4n6), and glutamyl amino acids gamma-glutamylglutamate, gamma-glutamylglycine, and gamma-glutamylleucine were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (fourth versus first quartile HRs=2.07-2.14; P-values <5.2√ó10-5). By contrast, the ascorbate/aldarate metabolite oxalate, xenobiotics S-carboxymethyl-L-cysteine, fibrinogen cleavage peptides ADpSGEGDFXAEGGGVR and fibrinopeptide B (1-12) were related to reduced disease-specific mortality (fourth versus first quartile HRs=0.82-0.84; P-value <5.2√ó10-5). Further adjustment for years from blood collection to cancer diagnosis, body mass index, smoking intensity and duration, and serum total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not alter the results. Participants with a higher metabolic score based on the discovery set had an elevated risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality in the replication set (fourth versus first quartile, HR=3.9, P-value for trend<0.0001).

By utilizing the large-scale Electronic Health Record data found in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States, we have developed an automated, personalized risk prediction model to support the clinical decision-making process for localized prostate cancer patients. This method combines the representative power of deep learning and the analytical interpretability of parametric regression models and can implement both time-dependent and static input data. To collect a comprehensive evaluation of model performances, we calculate time-dependent C-statistics [Formula: see text] over 2-, 5-, and 10-year time horizons using either a composite outcome or prostate cancer mortality as the target event. The composite outcome combines the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) test, metastasis, and prostate cancer mortality. Our longitudinal model Recurrent Deep Survival Machine (RDSM) achieved [Formula: see text] 0.85 (0.83), 0.80 (0.83), and 0.76 (0.81), while the cross-sectional model Deep Survival Machine (DSM) attained [Formula: see text] 0.85 (0.82), 0.80 (0.82), and 0.76 (0.79) for the 2-, 5-, and 10-year composite (mortality) outcomes, respectively. In addition to estimating the survival probability, our method can quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction. The uncertainty scores show a consistent correlation with the prediction accuracy. We find PSA and prostate cancer stage information are the most important indicators in risk prediction.

Taking new data from the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) era into account, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 2009 contouring guideline for the pelvic LNs from 2009 was updated by the NRG Oncology group in 2020 (NRG 2020).  Objective:   To evaluate and validate the updated NRG 2020 guideline with our established LN atlas.  Design, setting, and participants:   We screened 1653 PSMA PET/computed tomography (CT) data sets for patients with biochemical relapse who underwent a PET scan between November 2012 and November 2017. After screening, we developed an LN atlas using data from 233 patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated LN overlap (OL) with the RTOG 2009 and NRG 2020 contouring guidelines. OL was defined as within (>90%), partly within (10-90%), or outside (<10%).  Results and limitations:   In comparison to the RTOG 2009 guideline, 403 (52%), 134 (17%), and 241 (31%) of the LNs were not, were partly, or were fully covered within the overall group, respectively. By contrast, using the NRG 2020 guideline, 302 (39%), 190 (24%), and 286 (37%) of the LNs were not, were partly, or were fully covered, respectively (p < 0.001). Limitations include the retrospective design with missing data and no histopathological confirmation of the PET results.  Conclusions:   The updated NRG 2020 contouring guideline improves coverage of the pelvic LNs in patients undergoing salvage radiation therapy. However, PET/CT should be considered whenever possible to ensure coverage of untypical LN spread.  Patient summary:   We compared the 2009 and 2020 guidelines on the radiation area for the pelvis for patients with recurrent prostate cancer that has spread to lymph nodes. The newer guideline provides better coverage of pelvic lymph nodes than the older one and is useful in planning radiation therapy. However, a scan of the pelvis using the newest technique should be considered for individual patients to ensure coverage of untypical lymph nodes.""","""['Marco M E Vogel', 'Mathias D√ºsberg', 'Lucia St√∂hrer', 'Sabrina Dewes', 'Eva K Sage', 'Kai J Borm', 'J√ºrgen E Gschwend', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Stephanie E Combs', 'Kilian Schiller']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['PSMA-PET/CT-based Lymph Node Atlas for Prostate Cancer Patients Recurring After Primary Treatment: Clinical Implications for Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'An Analysis of the Distribution of PSMA PET/CT-Positive Lymph Nodes and Their Coverage by Different Elective Nodal Radiation Volumes in Postoperative Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'How accurate is 68Gallium-prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography / computed tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) on primary lymph node staging before radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer?

This issue is increasingly controversial as multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become the most influential diagnostic tool for local staging of PCa over the past two decades.  Objective:   To compare various models of T category based on DRE or mpMRI to predict early biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted between 2014 and 2021. A total of 1436 patients were recruited across eight referral centers in France, Italy, Switzerland, and Belgium.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   BCR was defined as two prostate-specific antigen values of ‚â•0.2 ng/ml during follow-up. Harrell's concordance index (C index) was used to compare the discrimination of four models of T staging based on DRE (model 1: cT1 vs cT2 vs cT3) or mpMRI (model 2: organ-confined disease vs extracapsular extension [iECE] vs seminal vesicle invasion [iSVI]; model 3: Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS] ‚â§3 vs PI-RADS 4 vs PI-RADS 5; and model 4: iT2a [PI-RADS ‚â§3] vs iT2b [PI-RADS 4] vs iT2c [PI-RADS 5 excluding ECE or SVI] vs iT3a [ECE] vs iT3b [SVI]) to predict BCR.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 74 (5%), 845 (59%), 482 (34%), and 35 (2%) patients had low-, intermediate-, high-, and very high-risk PCa, respectively, according to the Mazzone risk classification. After median follow-up of 16 mo, 113 patients experienced BCR. Although the new five-group mpMRI-based T classification system (model 4) had the highest prognostic discrimination (C index 0.694) for predicting early BCR on multivariable analysis, there was overlap between the 95% confidence intervals of the models. On sensitivity analysis, the new mpMRI-based T staging still had a higher C index than DRE for predicting BCR when excluding cN1 patients and comparing it with a five-group DRE-based T classification (cT1c vs cT2a vs cT2b vs cT2c vs cT3), but the overlap between the 95% confidence intervals of the models remained. The main limitation is the short follow-up.  Conclusions:   We described an alternative mpMRI-based T staging for prediction of early BCR after RP for PCa. Our results need to be validated externally before they can be applied in clinical practice.

Our objective is to study the morbidity and mortality of RP in Spain from 2011 to 2015 and to evaluate the geographic variation.  Material and methods:   We designed a retrospective observational study of all patients submitted to RP in Spain during five consecutive years (2011-2015). The data was extracted from the ¬´Conjunto M√≠nimo B√°sico de Datos¬ª (CMBD). We have evaluated geographic variations in terms of morbidity and hospital stay, and the impact of the mean annual surgical volume for each center on these variables.  Results:   Between 2011-2015, a total of 37,725 RPs were performed in 221 Spanish public hospitals. The mean age of the series was 63.9¬±3.23 years. Of all RPs, 50% were performed through an open approach, and 43.4% have been operated on in hospitals with <500 beds. We observed an important variability in the distribution of the cases operated on in the different regions. The regions that perform more RPs are Andalusia, Catalonia, Galicia, and Madrid. Our study shows a complication rate of 8.6%, with hemorrhage and the need for transfusion being the most frequent (5.3 and 4%, respectively). There are significant differences in bleeding rates and hospital stay among regions, which are maintained after adjusting for patient characteristics and type of hospital. When studying the annual surgical volume of each hospital, we find that the impact on the rate of hemorrhage or transfusion is linear; however, hospital stay remains stable at around 5 days from 60 RPs/year.  Conclusions:   In national terms, morbidity and mortality rates after RP are comparable to those described in the literature. This study reveals a clear dispersion in the hospitals that carry out this intervention, showing clear differences in terms of morbidity and hospital stay between the different regions.""","""['A Guijarro', 'A Castro', 'V Hern√°ndez', 'E de la Pe√±a', 'L S√°nchez-Rosendo', 'E Jim√©nez', 'E P√©rez-F√©rnandez', 'C Llorente']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Variability in complications and operative mortality after radical cystectomy in Spain.', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'The epidemiology of hospital admissions due to leishmaniasis in Spain (1999-2003).', 'A Systematic Review of the Impact of Surgeon and Hospital Caseload Volume on Oncological and Nononcological Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Open and robot-assisted radical retropubic prostatectomy in men receiving ongoing low-dose aspirin medication: revisiting an old paradigm?']"""

Prostate-specific antigen screening rates have decreased since 2008 in the US, and the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer has increased. However, there is no direct epidemiologic evidence of a correlation between population PSA screening rates and subsequent metastatic prostate cancer rates.  Objective:   To assess whether facility-level variation in PSA screening rates is associated with subsequent facility-level metastatic prostate cancer incidence.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort used data for all men aged 40 years or older with an encounter at 128 facilities in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2019.  Exposures:   Yearly facility-level PSA screening rates, defined as the proportion of men aged 40 years or older with a PSA test in each year, and long-term nonscreening rates, defined as the proportion of men aged 40 years or older without a PSA test in the prior 3 years, from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2014.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcomes were facility-level yearly counts of incident metastatic prostate cancer diagnoses and age-adjusted yearly metastatic prostate cancer incidence rates (per 100 000 men) 5 years after each PSA screening exposure year.  Results:   The cohort included 4 678 412 men in 2005 and 5 371 701 men in 2019. Prostate-specific antigen screening rates decreased from 47.2% in 2005 to 37.0% in 2019, and metastatic prostate cancer incidence increased from 5.2 per 100 000 men in 2005 to 7.9 per 100 000 men in 2019. Higher facility-level PSA screening rates were associated with lower metastatic prostate cancer incidence 5 years later (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.91 per 10% increase in PSA screening rate; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96; P < .001). Higher long-term nonscreening rates were associated with higher metastatic prostate cancer incidence 5 years later (IRR, 1.11 per 10% increase in long-term nonscreening rate; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19; P = .01).  Conclusions and relevance:   From 2005 to 2019, PSA screening rates decreased in the national VHA system.

Methods: CDCP1 mRNA expression was evaluated using large transcriptomic datasets of normal/tumor samples for 23 types of cancer and 15 other normal organs, and CDCP1 protein expression was examined in 34 normal tissues, >300 samples from six types of cancer, and in 49 cancer cell lines. A recombinant human/mouse chimeric anti-CDCP1 antibody (ch10D7) was labelled with 89Zirconium or monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and tested in multiple pre-clinical cancer models including 36 cancer cell lines and three mouse xenograft models. Results: Analysis of CDCP1 expression indicates elevated CDCP1 expression in the majority of the cancers and restricted expression in normal human tissues. Antibody ch10D7 demonstrates a high affinity and specificity for CDCP1 inducing cell signalling via Src accompanied by rapid internalization of ch10D7/CDCP1 complexes in cancer cells. 89Zirconium-labelled ch10D7 accumulates in CDCP1 expressing cells enabling detection of pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice by PET imaging. Cytotoxicity of MMAE-labelled ch10D7 against kidney, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer cells in vitro, correlates with the level of CDCP1 on the plasma membrane. ch10D7-MMAE displays robust anti-tumor effects against mouse xenograft models of pancreatic, colorectal and ovarian cancer.

Altered telomere length among cancer cells combined with shorter telomere length in cancer-associated stromal cells, strongly implicated with progression to prostate cancer metastasis and cancer death and providing a novel target for therapeutics. Transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) signaling pathways are well-recognized for their role in stromal-epithelial interactions responsible for prostate androgen responsiveness, promoting tumorigenesis. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We sought to establish a role for TGF-Œ≤ in the regulation of telomere length in mouse and human prostate fibroblast. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based telomere length measuring methods are widely used due to their repeatability and reproducibility. Using real-time RT-PCR-based telomere length measuring method, we identified that TGF-beta regulates telomere length via increased expression of histone methyltransferase, Suv39h1, which in turn affected histone methylation levels at the telomeric ends. Moreover, treatment of DAPT and non-steroidal antiandrogen bicalutamide demonstrated that notch and androgen signaling co-operated with TGF-√ü in regulating stromal telomere length. Telomere variation in tumor cells and non-tumor cells within the tumor microenvironment greatly facilitates the clinical assessment of prostate cancer; therefore, understanding stromal telomere length regulation mechanism will hold significant prospects for cancer treatment, diagnosis, and prognosis.

This model has been applied in patients with genitourinary cancers and proved to be effective and efficient. Our study demonstrated that more patients benefited from this model during the pandemic of COVID-19, especially in those affected heavily by COVID-19. These results suggested that it can also give insight into the management of other cancer survivors in China.

All inorganic compounds have been studied by X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetry, vibrational and EPR spectroscopy as well as theoretical methods. The geometry of the complexes 1, 3 and 4 adopts nearly perfect geometry close to square planar (1, 4) or square pyramid (3) stereochemistry, respectively. The distortion of five coordinated copper(ii) ions in complex 2 indicates intermediate geometry between square pyramidal and trigonal pyramidal geometry. Further, the magnetic measurements have shown antiferromagnetic behaviour of the prepared complexes in a wide range of temperatures. The antiferromagnetic behaviour of 2 should originate from the superexchange interactions between each copper(ii) ion by the mixed chloride and Œº4-O ion pathways. Besides, the weak antiferromagnetic character of 2 can be also attributed to the presence of intrachain exchange between dimeric units through double oxide ion. In complex 3, strong antiferromagnetic coupling between Cu(ii) centres in the Cu2O2Cl2 moiety is found. The cytotoxicity of all compounds was tested in vitro against various cancer cell lines: human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF7), human prostate carcinoma; derived from metastatic site: brain (DU-145) and two normal cell lines: human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and human keratinocyte (HaCat). Furthermore, Pluronic P-123 micelles loaded with selected complexes (1 and 3) were proposed to overcome low solubility and to minimize systemic side effects.

Methods:   Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) were used to analyze the multiomic roles of AATF in 33 tumor types, including gene and protein expression, survival prognosis, gene mutation, DNA methylation, protein phosphorylation, AATF coexpressed genes and their enrichment analysis, and immunological analysis.  Results:   In TCGA and GTEx databases, 31 tumors and their corresponding normal tissues had AATF expression data, and it was differentially expressed in 29 of them. AATF was elevated in 27 tumors, decreased in 2 tumors, and was a risk factor for overall survival (OS) in 8 tumors and a risk factor for disease-free survival (DFS) in 4 tumors. AATF expression levels in various cancer types were significantly correlated with the infiltration levels of cancer-associated fibroblasts, endothelial cells, CD4+ T cells, B cells, myeloid dendritic cells, eosinophils, and macrophages. The immune checkpoints PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA4 were positively correlated with AATF expression in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney chromophobe (KICH), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD).

However, efforts to deploy clinical strategies for VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cell cancer therapy are hampered by insufficient potency. We are pursuing an alternate strategy of modifying tumors to increase the capacity for VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cell activation, as a means for strengthening the anti-tumor response by resident or ex vivo manufactured VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells. VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells are activated in vitro by non-peptidic antigens including isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), a substrate of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) in the pathway for biosynthesis of isoprenoids. In an effort to improve in vivo potency of VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells, we reduced FDPS expression in tumor cells using a lentivirus vector encoding a short-hairpin RNA that targets FDPS mRNA (LV-shFDPS). Prostate (PC3) or hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh-7) cells transduced with LV-shFDPS induced VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cell stimulation in vitro, resulting in increased cytokine expression and tumor cell cytotoxicity. Immune deficient mice implanted with LV-shFDPS transduced tumor cells showed dramatic responses to intraperitoneal injection of VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells with strong suppression of tumor growth. In vivo potency was increased by transducing tumor cells with a vector expressing both shFDPS and human IL-2. Tumor suppression by VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells was dose-dependent with greater effects observed in mice injected with 100% LV-shFDPS transduced cells compared to mice injected with a mixture of 50% LV-shFDPS transduced cells and 50% control (no vector) tumor cells. Delivery of LV-shFDPS by intratumoral injection was insufficient to knockdown FDPS in the majority of tumor cells, resulting in insignificant tumor suppression by VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells. Thus, VŒ≥9VŒ¥2 T cells efficiently targeted and suppressed tumors expressing shFDPS in mouse xenotransplant models.

Hypomethylation and resultant overexpression of PARM1 was found in DLBCL. The high-level expression of PARM1 was related to the poor outcome of DLBCL patients. PARM1 participated in DNA repair, cell cycle, and cellular response to stress. PARM1 was also associated with autophagy, apoptosis, Ras pathway, and MAPK cascade. Significant kinase targets of PARM1 included ATM, CDK1, and CDK2. Significant transcription factor targets of PARM1 involved ELK1, MYC and so on. Significant miRNA targets of PARM1 included miR21, miR202, miR323, and miR345. Further analysis suggested that the PARM1 regulated autophagy through the PI3K-Akt signaling.

A recent study evaluated the prognostic value of whole-body tumor volume using a semiautomatic method relying on a 50% threshold of lesion SUVmax (PSMATV50). In the present study, we analyzed the suitability of this approach comparing 18F-PSMA-1007 with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans and the potential of PSMATV50 for the prediction of overall survival (OS) in patients before 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT). Moreover, PSMATV50 was integrated into the PSMA PET/CT consensus statement as well as RECIP 1.0, and the prognostic value of these response classification systems was compared. Methods: This retrospective study included 70 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer undergoing PSMA RLT. Thirty-three patients were monitored by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and 37 patients by 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. PET/CT scans before (baseline) and at the end of PSMA RLT after 2-4 cycles (follow-up) were separately analyzed by 2 readers. PSMATV50 at baseline and its change at the time of follow-up (ŒîPSMATV50, expressed as a ratio) were correlated with OS using Cox proportional-hazards regression. The results of both subgroups were compared. The integration of ŒîPSMATV50 in existing response classification systems was evaluated. To assess and compare the discriminatory strength of these classification systems, G√∂nen and Heller concordance probability estimates were calculated. Results: PSMATV50 determination was technically feasible in all examinations. A higher PSMATV50 at baseline and a higher ŒîPSMATV50 were strongly associated with a shorter OS for both 68Ga-PSMA-11 (PSMATV50: hazard ratio [HR] of 1.29 [95% CI, 1.05-1.55], P = 0.009; ŒîPSMATV50: HR of 1.83 [95% CI, 1.08-3.09], P = 0.024) and 18F-PSMA-1007 (PSMATV50: HR of 1.84 [95% CI, 1.13-2.99], P = 0.014; ŒîPSMATV50: HR of 1.23 [95% CI, 1.04-1.51], P = 0.03). Response assessment provided high discriminatory power for OS for the PSMA PET/CT consensus statement (concordance probability estimate, 0.73) as well as RECIP 1.0 (concordance probability estimate, 0.74). Conclusion: PSMATV50 and ŒîPSMATV50 proved to be predictive of OS not only for 68Ga-PSMA-11 but also for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scans.

We aimed to determine whether an equivalent ratio is suitable for a SPECT tracer, 99mTc-MIP-1404, and to compare lesion and lesion-to-normal-organ ratios between the 2 radiotracers. Methods: Two cohorts of patients with mCRPC matched for age, prostate-specific antigen level, and total Gleason score, with either 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT/CT (n = 25) or 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (n = 25) scans, were included for analysis. Up to 3 lesions in each site (prostate/prostate bed, lymph nodes, bone and soft-tissue metastases) as well as normal liver, parotid gland, spleen, and mediastinal blood-pool SUVmax were measured. Results: 99mTc-MIP-1404 SPECT lesion SUVmax was not significantly different from 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (median, 18.2 vs. 17.3; P = 0.93). However, 99mTc-MIP-1404 liver SUVmax was higher (median, 8.5 vs. 5.8; P = 0.002) and lesion-to-liver ratios were lower (median, 2.7 vs. 3.5; P = 0.009).

Methods:   Data on new cancer diagnoses during 2001-2018 were obtained from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries' Cancer in North America Incidence file, which is comprised of data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded and National Cancer Institute-funded, population-based cancer registry programs. Data on cancer deaths during 2001-2019 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital Statistics System. Five-year average incidence and death rates along with trends for all cancers combined and for the leading cancer types are reported by sex, racial/ethnic group, and age.  Results:   Overall cancer incidence rates were 497 per 100,000 among males (ranging from 306 among Asian/Pacific Islander males to 544 among Black males) and 431 per 100,000 among females (ranging from 309 among Asian/Pacific Islander females to 473 among American Indian/Alaska Native females) during 2014-2018. The trend during the corresponding period was stable among males and increased 0.2% on average per year among females, with differing trends by sex, racial/ethnic group, and cancer type. Among males, incidence rates increased for three cancers (including pancreas and kidney), were stable for seven cancers (including prostate), and decreased for eight (including lung and larynx) of the 18 most common cancers considered in this analysis. Among females, incidence rates increased for seven cancers (including melanoma, liver, and breast), were stable for four cancers (including uterus), and decreased for seven (including thyroid and ovary) of the 18 most common cancers. Overall cancer death rates decreased by 2.3% per year among males and by 1.9% per year among females during 2015-2019, with the sex-specific declining trend reflected in every major racial/ethnic group. During 2015-2019, death rates decreased for 11 of the 19 most common cancers among males and for 14 of the 20 most common cancers among females, with the steepest declines (>4% per year) reported for lung cancer and melanoma. Five-year survival for adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer improved between 2001 and 2018; however, overall incidence (2001-2018) and mortality (2001-2019) continued to increase for this site. Among children (younger than 15 years), recent trends were stable for incidence and decreased for mortality; and among, adolescents and young adults (aged 15-39 years), recent trends increased for incidence and declined for mortality.  Conclusions:   Cancer death rates continued to decline overall, for children, and for adolescents and young adults, and treatment advances have led to accelerated declines in death rates for several sites, such as lung and melanoma. The increases in incidence rates for several common cancers in part reflect changes in risk factors, screening test use, and diagnostic practice.

In addition, the 2.5 MV beam has an energy bridging the gap between kilo-voltage (kV) and mega-voltage (MV) beams for applications of dose enhancement with high atomic number (Z) nanoparticles.  Methods:   We have commissioned and utilized a MATLAB-based, open-source treatment planning software (TPS), matRad, for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose calculations. Treatment plans for prostate, liver, and head and neck (H&N), nasal cavity, two orbit cases, and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were performed and compared to a conventional 6 MV beam. Additional Monte Carlo calculations were also used for benchmarking the central axis dose.  Results:   Both beams had similar planning target volume (PTV) dose coverage for all cases. However, the 2.5 MV beam deposited 6%-19% less integral doses to the nasal cavity, orbit, and GBM cases than 6 MV photons. The mean dose to the heart in the liver plan was 10.5% lower for 2.5 MV beam. The difference between the doses to OARs of H&N for two beams was under 3%. Brain mean dose, brainstem, and optic chiasm max doses were, respectively, 7.5%-14.9%, 2.2%-8.1%, and 2.5%-19.0% lower for the 2.5 MV beam in the nasal cavity, orbit, and GBM plans.  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that the 2.5 MV beam can produce clinically relevant treatment plans, motivating future efforts for design of single-energy LINACs.

The dosimetric impact of contour variability on inverse planning has been rarely reported. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether automatically generated organs-at-risk (OARs) could be used in inverse prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) planning and whether the dosimetric parameters are still clinically acceptable after radiation oncologists modify the OARs.  Methods and materials:   Planning computed tomography images from 10 patients treated with SBRT for prostate cancer were selected and automatically segmented by commercially available atlas-based software. The automatically generated OAR contours were compared with the manually drawn contours. Two volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, autoRec-VMAT (where only automatically generated rectums were used in optimization) and autoAll-VMAT (where automatically generated OARs were used in inverse optimization) were generated. Dosimetric parameters based on the manually drawn PTV and OARs were compared with the clinically approved plans.  Results:   The DCs for the rectum contours varied from 0.55 to 0.74 with a mean value of 0.665. Differences of D95 of the PTV between autoRec-VMAT and manu-VMAT plans varied from 0.03% to -2.85% with a mean value of -0.64%. Differences of D0.03cc of manual rectum between the two plans varied from -0.86% to 9.94% with a mean value of 2.71%. D95 of PTV between autoAll-VMAT and manu-VMAT plans varied from 0.28% to -2.9% with a mean value -0.83%. Differences of D0.03cc of manual rectum between the two plans varied from -0.76% to 6.72% with a mean value of 2.62%.  Conclusion:   Our study implies that it is possible to use unedited automatically generated OARs to perform initial inverse prostate SBRT planning.

To sustain prostate tumorigenicity, EZH2 establishes non-canonical biochemical interaction with AR for mediating oncogene activation, in addition to its canonical role as a transcriptional repressor and enzymatic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). However, the molecular basis underlying non-canonical activities of EZH2 in prostate cancer remains elusive, and a therapeutic strategy for targeting EZH2:AR-mediated oncogene activation is also lacking. Here, we report that a cryptic transactivation domain of EZH2 (EZH2TAD) binds both AR and AR spliced variant 7 (AR-V7), a constitutively active AR variant enriched in CRPC, mediating assembly and/or recruitment of transactivation-related machineries at genomic sites that lack PRC2 binding. Such non-canonical targets of EZH2:AR/AR-V7:(co-)activators are enriched for the clinically relevant oncogenes. We also show that EZH2TAD is required for the chromatin recruitment of EZH2 to oncogenes, for EZH2-mediated oncogene activation and for CRPC growth in vitro and in vivo. To completely block EZH2's multifaceted oncogenic activities in prostate cancer, we employed MS177, a recently developed proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) of EZH2. Strikingly, MS177 achieved on-target depletion of both EZH2's canonical (EZH2:PRC2) and non-canonical (EZH2TAD:AR/AR-V7:co-activators) complexes in prostate cancer cells, eliciting far more potent antitumor effects than the catalytic inhibitors of EZH2. Overall, this study reports a previously unappreciated requirement for EZH2TAD for mediating EZH2's non-canonical (co-)activator recruitment and gene activation functions in prostate cancer and suggests EZH2-targeting PROTACs as a potentially attractive therapeutic for the treatment of aggressive prostate cancer that rely on the circuits wired by EZH2 and AR.""","""['Jun Wang', 'Kwang-Su Park', 'Xufen Yu', 'Weida Gong', 'H Shelton Earp', 'Gang Greg Wang', 'Jian Jin', 'Ling Cai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Dissecting and targeting noncanonical functions of EZH2 in multiple myeloma via an EZH2 degrader.', 'EZH2 noncanonically binds cMyc and p300 through a cryptic transactivation domain to mediate gene activation and promote oncogenesis.', 'Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Beyond Expression: Role of Phosphorylated Residues of EZH2 in Lineage Plasticity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Going beyond Polycomb: EZH2 functions in prostate cancer.', 'An EZH2-NF-Œ∫B regulatory axis drives expression of pro-oncogenic gene signatures in triple negative breast cancer.', 'PROTACs: A novel strategy for cancer drug discovery and development.', 'Dual inhibition of EZH2 and G9A/GLP histone methyltransferases by HKMTI-1-005 promotes differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells.', 'Dissecting and targeting noncanonical functions of EZH2 in multiple myeloma via an EZH2 degrader.']"""

Previous reports have explicitly outlined various biological activities of Cucurbitaceae family members, including the anticancer activity of Cur-B. In the present study, we tried to elucidate the anticancer efficacy of Cur-B against prostate cancer PC3 cells. PC3 cells were exposed to purified Cur-B at 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 ¬µM for 24. Cur-B exposure reduced cell viability of PC3 cells at 5 ¬µM (p < 0.05), with further reduction with increased Cur-B concentration (15 ¬µM, p < 0.01 and 25 ¬µM, p < 0.001). Cur-B also succeeded in instigating nuclear fragmentation and condensation, followed by activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 proportionally with increasing concentrations of Cur-B. Treatment with Cur-B also instigated ROS-mediated oxidative stress both qualitatively and quantitatively at 5 ¬µM, p < 0.05; 15 ¬µM, p < 0.01 and 25 ¬µM, p < 0.001. Increased ROS after Cur-B treatment also led to dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby resulting in considerable apoptosis (p < 0.001), which, again, was proportionally dependent on Cur-B concentration. Cur-B exposure to PC3 cells was concomitantly followed by reduced cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) expression and augmented mRNA expression of CDK inhibitor p21Cip1. Intriguingly, Cur-B exposure also led to considerable downregulation of the JAK/STAT signaling cascade, which may be the reason behind Cur-B-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest within PC3 cells.

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used as control cell lines to represent blood-vessel cells that suffer from the systemic toxicity of Doxorubicin. In the presence of an external magnetic field that is 300√ó times lower than an MRI field, we successfully nanoporated the cancer cells, then triggered the release of 500 nM of doxorubicin from Dox-MagSiNs to successfully kill >50% PC3, >50% A2780 cells, and killed 125% more MDAMB231 cells than free Dox.HCl. In control HUVECs, the Dox-MagSiNs did not nanoporate into the HUVECS and did not exhibited any cytotoxicity at all when there was no triggered release of Dox.HCl. Currently, the major advantages of our approach are, (i) the MagSiNs are biocompatible in vitro and in vivo; (ii) the label-free nanoporation of Dox-MagSiNs into cancer cells and not the model blood vessel cell line; (iii) the complete cancellation of the cytotoxicity of Doxorubicin in the Dox-MagSiNs form; (iv) the clinical impact of such a nanocarrier will be that it will be possible to increase the current upper limit for cumulative-dosages of anthracyclines through multiple dosing, which in turn will improve the anti-cancer efficacy of anthracyclines.""","""['Margo Waters', 'Juliane Hopf', 'Emma Tam', 'Stephanie Wallace', 'Jordan Chang', 'Zach Bennett', 'Hadrian Aquino', 'Ryan K Roeder', 'Paul Helquist', 'M Sharon Stack', 'Prakash D Nallathamby']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pharmaceuticals (Basel)""","""['Increased Toxicity of Doxorubicin Encapsulated into pH-Responsive Poly(Œ≤-Amino Ester)-Functionalized MCM-41 Silica Nanoparticles.', 'Hybrid silica-coated Gd-Zn-Cu-In-S/ZnS bimodal quantum dots as an epithelial cell adhesion molecule targeted drug delivery and imaging system.', 'Optically traceable PLGA-silica nanoparticles for cell-triggered doxorubicin delivery.', 'Characterization and Evaluation of Bone-Derived Nanoparticles as a Novel pH-Responsive Carrier for Delivery of Doxorubicin into Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Quantum dot-A10 RNA aptamer-doxorubicin conjugate.', 'Iron Oxide@Mesoporous Silica Core-Shell Nanoparticles as Multimodal Platforms for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Magnetic Hyperthermia, Near-Infrared Light Photothermia, and Drug Delivery.', 'Magnetic Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery through Tapered Stenosed Artery with Blood Based Non-Newtonian Fluid.']"""

Results from the Zurich Cancer Registry""","""In Switzerland, there is a large seasonal variation in sunlight, and vitamin D deficiency is relatively common during winter. The season of diagnosis may be linked to cancer survival via vitamin D status. Using data from the Cancer Registry of Zurich, Zug, Schaffhausen, and Schwyz with more than 171,000 cancer cases registered since 1980, we examined the association of the season of diagnosis with survival for cancers including prostate (ICD10 code C61; International Categorization of Diseases, version 10), breast (C50), colorectal (C18-21), lung (C34), melanoma (C43), and all sites combined. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the differences in the all-cause mortality by the season of the diagnosis. Winter was used as the reference season. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for all the cancers combined (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and for prostate (in men), breast (in women), colorectal, lung cancer, and melanomas, separately. A diagnosis in summer and/or autumn was associated with improved survival in all the sites combined for both sexes (men: HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.96-0.99]; women: HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.94-0.99]) and in colorectal (HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.84-0.99]), melanoma (HR 0.81 [95% CI 0.65-1.00]), and breast cancer (HR 0.91 [95% CI 0.94-0.99]) in women. Our study results suggest that a cancer diagnosis in summer and/or autumn is associated with a better prognosis. The improved seasonal survival coincides with the seasonal variation of sun-induced vitamin D, and vitamin D may play a protective and beneficial role in cancer survival.""","""['Ola Hysaj', 'Nena Karavasiloglou', 'Manuela Limam', 'Miriam Wanner', 'Dimitri Korol', 'Sabine Rohrmann']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Seasonal and geographical variations in lung cancer prognosis in Norway.

The treatment of advanced cases is based on chemotherapy, which lacks specificity and efficacy, due to severe side effects and resistance to the traditional drugs. Copper complexes have shown antitumoral efficacy and low toxicity, being considered a promising class of metal-based drugs for the treatment of malignant neoplasms. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the cellular effects of a copper(II) complex with 4-fluorophenoxyacetic acid hydrazide and 1,10-phenanthroline (1) on PCa cell lines, as well as the mutagenic/recombinogenic and anticarcinogenic potential of 1 in Drosophila melanogaster. PNT-2 (non-tumorigenic), LNCaP (hormone-responsive PCa) and PC-3 (androgen-independent PCa) cells were cultured, and cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay. The expression levels of the proliferation markers Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 were analyzed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) and the Epithelial Tumor Test (ETT) were performed. Complex 1 was selective to LNCaP cells, significantly reducing Ki-67 and Cyclin D1 expression levels. Sub-toxic concentrations of complex 1 were defined by the toxicity test in D. melanogaster, and no mutagenic/recombinogenic/carcinogenic effects were observed. Anticarcinogenic potential was observed in D. melanogaster, suggesting modulating activity of the complex 1 against Doxorubicin, a drug used as control by its carcinogenic properties.

A 78-year-old male patient with a pacemaker due to sick sinus syndrome and syncope was scheduled for IRE prostate ablation surgery under general anesthesia. He had a history of recovering from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after having been vaccinated against it and recovered without sequalae. Pacemaker interrogation and reprogramming to asynchronous AOO mode was carried out before surgery, however, sinus pause occurred repeatedly during ablation pulse delivery. After the first sinus pause of 2.25 s there was a decrease in continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP). During the delivery of the second and third pulses, identical sinus pauses were observed due to failure to capture. However, the atrial-paced rhythm recovered instantly, and vital signs became acceptable. Although sinus pause recovered gradually, the duration thereof was increased by the delivery of more IRE pulses, with a subsequent abrupt decrease seen in blood pressure. The pacemaker was urgently reprogrammed to DOO mode, after which there were no further pacing failures and no hemodynamic adverse events. For patients with pacemakers, close cardiac monitoring in addition to the interrogation of the pacemaker during the electromagnetic interference (EMI) procedure is recommended, especially in the case of having a disease that may aggravate cardiac vulnerability, such as COVID-19.""","""['Min Suk Chae', 'Nuri Lee', 'Hyun Jung Koh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Investigation of safety for electrochemotherapy and irreversible electroporation ablation therapies in patients with cardiac pacemakers.', 'The safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation for the ablation of prostate cancer: a multicentre prospective human in vivo pilot study protocol.', 'Percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) of prostate cancer: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) findings during follow\xa0up.', 'Why we should not routinely apply irreversible electroporation as an alternative curative treatment modality for localized prostate cancer at this stage.', 'Focal Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using Irreversible Electroporation.']"""

The 5-year bRFS was 82.9% in the BT group versus 80.1% in the RP group (p = 0.570). The 5-year CSS was 96.4% in the BT group versus 96.8% in the RP group (p = 0.967). Based on multivariate Cox regression analysis, Gleason score ‚â• 8 was the main independent prognostic factor for bRFS. Regarding the HRQoL, compared with the baseline, both treatments produced a significant decrease in different aspects of HRQoL at 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Patients in the BT group had lower HRQoL with regard to urinary irritation/obstruction and bowel function or bother, while patients in the RP group had lower HRQoL concerning urinary incontinence and sexual function or bother. There was no significant difference in HRQoL aspects between the two groups after follow-up for 2 years compared with the baseline. Conclusions: BT provides equivalent oncological control outcomes in terms of bRFS and CSS for patients with localized PCa compared with RP.

Interestingly, it occurs in several hereditary syndromes, including breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome (LS). Several gene mutations related to these syndromes have been identified as biomarkers in HPCa. The goal of this study was to screen for germline mutations in susceptibility genes by using a multigene panel, and to subsequently correlate the results with clinical and laboratory parameters. This was undertaken in 180 HBOC families, which included 217 males with prostate cancer (PCa). Mutational analysis was further extended to 104 family members of mutated patients. Screening of HBOC families revealed that 30.5% harbored germline mutations in susceptibility genes, with 21.6% harboring pathogenic variants (PVs) and 8.9% having variants of uncertain significance (VUS). We found PVs at similar frequency in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (8.8% and 9.4%, respectively), while 0.56% of PVs were present in well-established susceptibility genes PALB2, TP53 and RAD51C. Moreover, 0.56% of monoallelic PVs were present in MUTYH, a gene whose function in tumorigenesis in the context of PCa is still unclear. Finally, we reported double heterozygosity (DH) in BRCA1/2 genes in a single family, and found double mutation (DM) present in BRCA2 in a separate family. There was no significant difference between the mean age of onset of PCa in HBOC families with or without germline mutations in susceptibility genes, while the mean survival was highest in mutated patients compared to wild type.

Methods:   OCR was assessed using the Seahorse XF96 technology and EPR respirometry in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Mitochondrial superoxide production was measured by EPR with mitoTEMPO-H as a sensing probe. Tumor pO2 was measured in vivo using low-frequency EPR oximetry to define the optimal window of reoxygenation, the time at which tumors were irradiated with a single 6 Gy dose with a Cesium-137 irradiator.  Results:   24-h exposure to simvastatin and fluvastatin significantly decreased the OCR of PC-3 cancer cells. An increase in mitochondrial superoxide levels was also observed after fluvastatin exposure. The PC-3 prostate cancer model was found highly hypoxic at the basal level. When mice were treated with simvastatin or fluvastatin (daily injection of 20 mg/kg), tumor oxygenation increased 48 and 72 h after initiation of the treatment. However, despite reoxygenation, simvastatin did not sensitize the PC-3 tumor model to RT.

Discrimination according to risk stratification of AS duration and GSU was tested by Kaplan-Meier analysis and competing risk regression models. The proportion of patients who chose AS was the highest among LR PCa (3434, 12.1%), while the proportion in UIR PCa was the lowest (887, 7.3%). The AS duration was only associated with GSU in LR PCa, with a high Gleason score (GS) at diagnosis being a strong predictor of GSU for FIR and UIR PCa. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that long-term surveillance only made a significant difference in prognosis in UIR PCa.

However, initiating treatment immediately after recurrence may negatively impact quality of life without any survival gains. Therefore, we consider sustained strategies for initiating treatment based on specific characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which can indicate disease progression. We define the protocol for a target trial comparing treatment strategies based on PSA doubling time, in which androgen deprivation therapy is initiated only after doubling time decreases below a certain threshold. Such a treatment strategy means the timing of treatment initiation (if ever) is not known at baseline, and the target trial protocol must explicitly specify the frequency of PSA monitoring until the threshold is met, as well as the duration of treatment. We describe these and other components of a target trial that need to be specified in order for such a trial to be emulated in observational data. We then use the parametric g-formula and inverse-probability weighted dynamic marginal structural models to emulate our target trial in a cohort of prostate cancer patients from clinics across the United States.""","""['Louisa H Smith', 'Xabier Garc√≠a-Alb√©niz', 'June M Chan', 'Shoujun Zhao', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Jeanette M Broering', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Miguel A Hern√°n']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Epidemiol""","""['Immediate versus deferred initiation of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients with PSA-only relapse.

Significant uncorrected interfractional 6-Dimensional setup errors could impact the delivered dose. The aim of this study was to assess the dosimetric impact of 6D interfractional setup errors in hypofractionated prostate cancer using daily kilovoltage cone-beam computed tomography (kV-CBCT).  Methods:   This retrospective study comprised twenty prostate cancer patients treated with hypofractionated IMRT (8) and VMAT (12) with daily kV-CBCT image guidance. Interfraction 6D setup errors along lateral, longitudinal, vertical, pitch, roll, and yaw axes were evaluated for 400 CBCTs. For targets and organs at risk (OARs), the dosimetric impact of rotational error (RError), translational error (TError), and translational plus rotational error (T+RError) were evaluated on kV-CBCT images.  Results:   The single fraction maximum TError ranged from 12-20 mm, and the RError ranged from 2.80-3.00. The maximum mean absolute dose variation ŒîD in D98% (dose to 98% volume) of CTV-55 and PTV-55 was -0.66¬±0.82 and -5.94¬±3.8 Gy, respectively, in the T+RError. The maximum ŒîD (%) for D98% and D0.035cc in CTV-55 was -4.29% and 2.49%, respectively, while in PTV-55 it was -24.9% and 2.36%. The mean dose reduction for D98% in CTV-55 and D98% and D95% in PTV-55 was statistically significant (p<0.05) for TError and T+RError. The mean dose variation for Dmean and D50% in the rectum was statistically significant (p<0.05) for TError and T+RError.

However, there are several other genes in the region with potential importance in tumorigenesis. We, therefore, aimed to analyze in silico the potential prognostic significance of alterations in copy number and expression of genes present in the chr9p22.1-21.3 locus in 33 TCGA datasets (approximately 10,000 patients).  Materials and methods:   We analyzed which of the 27 genes are expressed in the datasets. Additionally, we associated the deletion of the locus with survival (log rank analysis) and hazard ratio (HR) (univariate cox regression). Finally, we performed univariate, multivariate, and overall survival analyses in 13 datasets considering the expression of 10 genes present in the locus.  Results:   We identified 10 genes of the chr9p22.1-21.3 locus expressed in the datasets (MLLT3, FOCAD, PTPLAD2, KLHL9, IFNE, MTAP, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, DMRTA1 and ELAVL2). Moreover, we found that deletion in at least 1 of these genes was associated with poor survival and increased HR in 13 datasets: adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), glioblastoma (GBM), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), low-grade glioma (LGG), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), mesothelioma (MESO), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), rectum adenocarcinoma (READ), sarcoma (SARC) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Finally, we found an association of survival/HR and altered expression of MLLT3 in the MESO dataset, of FOCAD in the READ dataset, of PTPLAD2 in the KIRP dataset, of KLHL9 in the LGG and UCEC datasets, of IFNE in ACC, GBM, KIRC and LUAD datasets, of MTAP in LGG, LUAD and MESO datasets, of CDKN2A in the HNSC, KIRC and MESO datasets, of CDKN2B in the LGG and READ datasets, of DMRTA1 in SARC datasets and of ELAVL2 in the LGG dataset (p<0.01 for all associations).

Materials and methods:   Five institutions created the first KBP model before April 2017 and subsequently devised a new model (second model) based on feedback from the first KBP and the efforts of planners after April 2019. The dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were validated for two prostate cancer cases between the first and second KBPs. Plan complexity metrics, of the modulation complexity score for VMAT (MCSv), closed leaf score (CLS), small aperture score (SAS), and leaf travel (LT), were compared. The delivery accuracy metrics of Œ≥ pass rate and point dose discrepancy (plan vs. measurement) at isocenter were also compared.  Results:   There were no significant differences in DVH parameters between the KBPs.

The purpose of this method is to quickly and accurately locate and identify abnormal cells, so as to improve the efficiency of prostate precancerous screening and promote the application and popularization of prostate cancer cell assisted screening technology.  Method:   The method includes two stages: preliminary screening of abnormal cell images and accurate identification of abnormal cells. In the preliminary screening stage of abnormal cell images, ResNet50 model is used as the image classification network to judge whether the local area contains cell clusters. In the another stage, YoloV5 model is used as the target detection network to locate and recognize abnormal cells in the image containing cell clusters.  Results:   This detection method aims at the pathological cell images obtained by the membrane method. And the double stage models proposed in this paper are compared with the single stage model method using only the target detection model. The results show that through the image classification network based on deep learning, we can first judge whether there are abnormal cells in the local area. If there are abnormal cells, we can further use the target detection method based on candidate box for analysis, which can reduce the reasoning time by 50% and improve the efficiency of abnormal cell detection under the condition of losing a small amount of accuracy and slightly increasing the complexity of the model.

Despite the development of the antiandrogens enzalutamide and abiraterone for CRPC, which target the androgen receptor (AR), drug resistance usually develops within 6 months and metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) leads to lethality. EZH2, found with SUZ12, EED, and RbAP48 in Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), has emerged as an alternative target for the treatment of deadly mCRPC. Unfortunately, drugs targeting EZH2 have shown limited efficacy in mCRPC. To address these failures, we have developed novel, dual-acting peptide inhibitors of PRC2 that uniquely target the SUZ12 protein component, resulting in the inhibition of both PRC2 canonical and noncanonical functions in prostate cancer. These peptides were found to inhibit not only the EZH2 methylation activity, but also block its positive effect on AR gene expression in prostate cancer cells. Since the peptide effect on AR levels is transcriptional, the inhibitory peptides can block the expression of both full-length AR and its splicing variants including AR-V7, which plays a significant role in the development of drug resistance. This dual-mode action provides the peptides with the capability to kill enzalutamide-resistant CRPC cells. These peptides are also more cytotoxic to prostate cancer cells than the combination of enzalutamide and an EZH2 inhibitory drug, which was recently suggested to be an effective treatment of mCRPC disease. Our data show that such a dual-acting therapeutic approach can be more effective than the existing front-line drug therapies for treating deadly mCRPC.""","""['Zhengyang Han', 'Ujjwal Rimal', 'Prabesh Khatiwada', 'Jacob Brandman', 'Jun Zhou', 'Muhammad Hussain', 'Ronald E Viola', 'Lirim Shemshedini']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""['Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Dual targeting of EZH2 and androgen receptor as a novel therapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.']"""

Hence, combination therapies have become the new standard of care (SOC) in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). However, head-to-head trails comparing different therapies as well as treatment-guiding biomarkers are still lacking. Thus, the aim of the present study was to compare clinical outcomes of Docetaxel versus NHT therapy in the real-world setting as well as to elaborate biomarkers predicting clinical outcome.  Methods:   We retrospectively assessed overall-survival (OS), progression-free survival 1 and 2 (PFS1/2) and time to progression (TTP) in 42 patients treated by either ADT + NHT or ADT + Docetaxel. In addition, we investigated clinical prognostic biomarkers.  Results:   Our survival analysis revealed 3-year OS of 89.4% in the NHT group compared to 82.4% in the Docetaxel group. 3-year PFS1 was 59.6% in the NHT group compared to 32.2% in the Docetaxel group and the TTP was 53.8% vs 32.2% (pOS = 0.189; pPFS1 = 0.082; pTTP = 0.055). In addition, castration-resistance occurred more often in the Docetaxel group (78.6% vs 25%, p = 0.004). Interestingly, a PSA-Nadir ‚â§ 0.05 ng/ml during therapy was associated with increased survival rates (p < 0.001) while PSA levels at primary diagnosis had no influence on therapy outcome. Furthermore, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increase during therapy was associated with improved clinical outcome (p = 0.06).  Conclusion:   We observed a trend towards a higher benefit of NHT as first-line treatment compared to Docetaxel in men with mHSPC. Of note, a PSA-Nadir ‚â§ 0.05 ng/ml or a TSH-increase during therapy were predictors for therapy response.""","""['Mona Kafka#', 'Thomas Burtscher#', 'Josef Fritz', 'Maximilian Schmitz', 'Jasmin Bektic', 'Michael Ladurner', 'Wolfgang Horninger', 'Isabel Heidegger']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Recently, we reported the first data on its activity in human cancer cells lines in vitro. Here, we investigated the activity, selectivity, and mechanism of action of NB in human prostate cancer cell lines, including drug-resistant subtypes. NB did not reveal cross-resistance to docetaxel in the PC3-DR cell line model and was highly active in hormone-independent 22Rv1 cells. NB-induced cell death was stipulated by externalization of phosphatidylserine and activation of caspase-3. Moreover, inhibition of caspase activity by z-VAD(OMe)-fmk did not affect NB cytotoxicity, suggesting a caspase-independent cell death induced by NB. The compound has a moderate p-glycoprotein (p-gp) substrate-like affinity and can simultaneously inhibit p-gp at nanomolar concentrations. Therefore, NB resensitized p-gp-overexpressing PC3-DR cells to docetaxel. A kinome profiling of the NB-treated cells revealed, among other things, an induction of mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK1/2 and p38. Further functional analysis confirmed an activation of both kinases and indicated a prosurvival role of this biological event in the cellular response to the treatment. Overall, NB holds promising anticancer potential and further structure-activity relationship studies and structural optimization are needed in order to improve its biological properties.""","""['Sergey A Dyshlovoy', 'Tobias Busenbender', 'Jessica Hauschild', 'Elena V Girich', 'Malte Kriegs', 'Konstantin Hoffer', 'Markus Graefen', 'Anton N Yurchenko', 'Carsten Bokemeyer', 'Gunhild von Amsberg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mar Drugs""","""['New diterpenes from the marine sponge Spongionella sp. overcome drug resistance in prostate cancer by inhibition of P-glycoprotein.', 'Cabazitaxel is more active than first-generation taxanes in ABCB1(+) cell lines due to its reduced affinity for P-glycoprotein.', 'FG020326 sensitized multidrug resistant cancer cells to docetaxel-mediated apoptosis via enhancement of caspases activation.', 'Chemical molecular-based approach to overcome multidrug resistance in cancer by targeting P-glycoprotein (P-gp).', 'Therapeutic strategies to overcome taxane resistance in cancer.', 'The Risk of Breast Cancer between Western and Mediterranean Dietary Patterns.', 'Marine Compounds and Cancer: Updates 2022.']"""

Results:   276 upregulated and 1,861 downregulated DEGs were analyzed from GSE30994 gene expression profiles. Through enrichment analysis, it was found that upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in nitric oxide-mediated signal transduction, insulin signaling pathway, etc. Through PPI networks, ARRB2 was determined as the hub gene that was highly expressed in pan cancers, including PRAD, and contributed to poor prognosis of PRAD patients. Immunoassay showed that ARRB2 was associated with B cells, NK cells, endothelial cells, etc. and also connected with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Next, the signature model analysis revealed that ARRB2 had a clinical value in predicting PRAD prognosis.

Results:   CMG2 was found to be inversely correlated with sex hormone receptors in breast and prostate cancer. Lower expression of CMG2 was associated with a poor prognosis in ER (+) breast cancer but not ER (-) tumours. Both ER (+) breast cancer cell lines and AR (+) prostate cancer cell lines presented lower expression of CMG2, which was increased following sex hormone deprivation.

Therefore, small molecules, which are able to image this KCa 3.1 channel in vitro and in vivo represent valuable diagnostic and prognostic tool compounds.

The novel senicapoc BODIPY conjugates with two F-atoms (9 a) and with a F-atom and a methoxy moiety (9 b) at the B-atom led to the characteristic punctate staining pattern resulting from labeling of single KCa 3.1 channels in A549-3R cells. This punctate pattern was completely removed by preincubation with an excess of senicapoc confirming the high specificity of KCa 3.1 labeling.

Purpose:   To validate a signal simulation framework for the use of sequence parameter optimization. To demonstrate the feasibility of ME-bSSFP for HP 13 C-MRI in patients. To evaluate the metabolism in PCa measured by ME-bSSFP.  Study type:   Retrospective single-center cohort study.  Phantoms/population:   Phantoms containing aqueous solutions of [1-13 C] lactate (2.3 M) and [13 C] urea (8 M). Eight patients (mean age 67 ¬± 6 years) with biopsy-confirmed Gleason 3 + 4 (n = 7) and 4 + 3 (n = 1) PCa. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCES: 1 H MRI at 3 T with T2 -weighted turbo spin-echo sequence used for spatial localization and spoiled dual gradient-echo sequence used for B0 -field measurement. ME-bSSFP sequence for 13 C MR spectroscopic imaging with retrospective multipoint IDEAL metabolite separation.  Assessment:   The primary endpoint was the analysis of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion in PCa and healthy prostate regions of interest (ROIs) using model-free area under the curve (AUC) ratios and a one-directional kinetic model (kP ). The secondary objectives were to investigate the correlation between simulated and experimental ME-bSSFP metabolite signals for HP 13 C-MRI parameter optimization.  Statistical tests:   Pearson correlation coefficients with 95% confidence intervals and paired t-tests. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.  Results:   Strong correlations between simulated and empirical ME-bSSFP signals were found (r > 0.96). Therefore, the simulation framework was used for sequence optimization.

Inorganic MCM-41 silica nanoparticles were synthesized, functionalized with phenylboronic acid groups (MCM-B), and capped with dextran (MCM-B-D). The nanoparticles were then characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis, nitrogen sorption, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis, before exploring their potential for drug loading and controlled drug release. This was done using a model prostate cancer drug, DOX, and a targeted prostate cancer drug, Œ±-Methyl Acyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) antibody-conjugated DOX, which attaches specifically to AMACR proteins that are overexpressed on the surfaces of prostate cancer cells. The kinetics of sustained drug release over 30 days was then studied using zeroth order, first order, second order, Higuchi, and the Korsmeyer-Peppas models, while the thermodynamics of drug release was elucidated by determining the entropy and enthalpy changes. The flux of the released DOX was also simulated using the COMSOL Multiphysics software package. Generally, the AMACR antibody-conjugated DOX drug-loaded nanoparticles were more effective than the free DOX drug-loaded formulations in inhibiting the growth of prostate cancer cells in vitro over a 96 h period. The implications of the results are then discussed for the development of drug-eluting structures for the localized and targeted treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Toyin Aina', 'Ali A Salifu', 'Sonu Kizhakkepura', 'Yiporo Danyuo', 'John D Obayemi', 'Josephine C Oparah', 'Theresa C Ezenwafor', 'Killian C Onwudiwe', 'Chukwuemeka J Ani', 'Suchi S Biswas', 'Chinyerem Onyekanne', 'Olushola S Odusanya', 'Jonathan Madukwe', 'Winston O Soboyejo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biomed Mater Res B Appl Biomater""","""['Decapeptide functionalized targeted mesoporous silica nanoparticles with doxorubicin exhibit enhanced apoptotic effect in breast and prostate cancer cells.', 'Increased Toxicity of Doxorubicin Encapsulated into pH-Responsive Poly(Œ≤-Amino Ester)-Functionalized MCM-41 Silica Nanoparticles.', 'Mesoporous silica nanoparticles combining Au particles as glutathione and pH dual-sensitive nanocarriers for doxorubicin.', 'Novel 2-arylthiopropanoyl-CoA inhibitors of Œ±-methylacyl-CoA racemase 1A (AMACR; P504S) as potential anti-prostate cancer agents.', 'Œ±-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR): metabolic enzyme, drug metabolizer and cancer marker P504S.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 35 patients with nonmetastatic CRPC and 72 patients with treatment-na√Øve metastatic castration-sensitive PC (mCSPC) who were treated with apalutamide.

Results:   Of the 107 patients, 65 (60.7%) and 42 (39.3%) were treated with full and reduced doses of apalutamide, respectively. The skin-related AE rate was not significantly different between the groups (55% vs. 43%, p = 0.761).

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 348 prostate cancer (PCa) patients who underwent RP in our center between May 2018 and June 2021. We divided them into non-LVI and LVI groups based on LVI status, and compared clinicopathological characteristics between non-LVI and LVI groups. Clinicopathological parameters including age, body mass index (BMI), history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NHT), pathological stage T (pT) and lymph node status (pN), ISUP (international society of urological pathology) grade, positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, and hematological parameters containing prostate-specific antigen (PSA), whole blood parameters and inflammatory indexes were collected. The association between the clinicopathological parameters and the presence of LVI was identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The pathological results of the RP specimen consisted of 53 (15.2%) patients with LVI and 295 (84.8%) cases without LVI. The level of PSA, percentages of advanced pT and grade, pN1, and PSM were significantly higher in the LVI group when compared with the non-LVI counterpart (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.007, respectively).

Toxicity, lack of clinical efficacy, and development of resistance phenotypes are the main challenges in the control of prostate malignancies. Notably, castration-resistance prostate cancer (CRPCa) is a highly aggressive and metastatic phenotype of the disease with a poor prognosis and very limited therapeutic options. Herein, we report the isolation and genotypic identification of a soil-derived fungus Aspergillus neoniveus using the PCR-based internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification approach. HPLC/MS investigation of the metabolic profile of the ethyl acetate extract from the fungal biomass revealed tentative identification of forty-five compounds belonging to various chemical classes including Œ≥-butyrolactones, alkaloids, phenolics, and quinoids. Furthermore, the chromatographic purification of microbial extract enabled the identification of nervonic acid methyl ester (1) for the first time from endophytic fungi, as well as acetyl aszonalenin (2), and butyrolactone II (3) for the first time from A. neoniveus. The chemical frameworks of the isolated compounds were identified via extensive spectral analysis including 1 and 2D NMR and MS. The X-ray crystal structure and absolute configuration of acetyl aszonalenin (2) were also determined. Additionally, screening of in vitro anticancer activity of the fungal extract revealed its potential antiproliferative and anti-migratory activities against five different prostate cancer cells (PC3, PC-3M, DU-145, CWR-R1ca, and 22Rv1), including different cells with the castration-resistance phenotype. Moreover, the isolated metabolites significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and colonization of human prostate cancer cells at low micromolar levels, thus providing credence for future investigation of these metabolites in relevant anti-prostate cancer animal models. Furthermore, computational target prediction tools identified the cannabinoid G-protein coupled receptors type 1 (CB1) as a potential biological target mediating, at least in part, the anticancer effects of acetylaszonalenin (2). Moreover, molecular modeling and docking studies revealed a favorable binding pose at the CB1 receptor orthosteric ligand pocket aided by multiple polar and hydrophobic interactions with critical amino acids. In conclusion, the Aspergillus neoniveus-derived prenylated indole alkaloid acetylaszonalenin has promising anticancer activity and is amenable to further hit-to-lead optimization for the control of prostate malignancies via modulating CB1 receptors.""","""['Menna Fayek', 'Hassan Y Ebrahim', 'Heba E Elsayed', 'Mohamed S Abdel-Aziz', 'Benson M Kariuki', 'Fatma A Moharram']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Isolation of anticancer and anti-trypanosome secondary metabolites from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus flocculus via bioactivity guided isolation and MS based metabolomics.', 'HPLC-DAD-Directed Isolation of Linearly Fused Prenylated Indole Alkaloids from a Soil-Derived Aspergillus versicolor.', 'Antiproliferative Activity and Characterization of Metabolites of Aspergillus nidulans: An Endophytic Fungus from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn.

The most likely cause for the inconsistence appears due to the fact that basic scientific studies are traditionally conducted on the cell lines and animal models, where it is impossible to completely reflect or replicate the in vivo status. Thus, we would like to propose the human prostate basal cell layer (PBCL) as ""the most effective target for the early detection and intervention of prostate cancer"".

The weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) was used to analyze the obtained key modules and genes, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. The phenotype and mechanism were verified in vitro.  Results:   A total of 18 genes were obtained by LASSO regression, and an RFS model was established and verified (TCGA, AUC: 0.774; GSE70768, AUC: 0.759). Three key genes were obtained using multivariate Cox regression. WGCNA analysis obtained the blue module closely related to the Gleason score (cor = -0.22, P = 3.3e - 05) and the unique gene glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2). Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the expression of GPX2 was significantly higher in patients with PCa than in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (P < 0.05), but there was no significant correlation with the Gleason score (GSE46602 and GSE6919 verified), which was also verified in the GSE46602 and GSE6919 datasets. The GSEA results showed that GPX2 expression was mainly related to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Wnt pathways. Additionally, GPX2 expression significantly correlated with eight kinds of immune cells. In human PCa cell lines LNCaP and 22RV1, si-GPX2 inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced apoptosis when compared with si-NC.

Joinpoint regression and average annual percentage change (AAPC) are common approaches for cancer projection, while time series models, traditional ways of trend analysis in statistics, were considered less popular. This study aims to compare these projection methods on seven types of cancers in 31 geographical jurisdictions.  Methods:   Using data from 66 cancer registries in the World Health Organization, projection models by joinpoint regression, AAPC, and autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) were constructed based on 20 years of cancer incidences. The rest of the data upon 20-years of record were used to validate the primary outcomes, namely, 3, 5, and 10-year projections. Weighted averages of mean-square-errors and of percentage errors on predictions were used to quantify the accuracy of the projection results.  Results:   Among 66 jurisdictions and seven selected cancers, ARIMAX gave the best 5 and 10-year projections for most of the scenarios. When the ten-year projection was concerned, ARIMAX resulted in a mean-square-error (or percentage error) of 2.7% (or 7.2%), compared with 3.3% (or 15.2%) by joinpoint regression and 7.8% (or 15.0%) by AAPC. All the three methods were unable to give reasonable projections for prostate cancer incidence in the US.  Conclusion:   ARIMAX outperformed the joinpoint regression and AAPC approaches by showing promising accuracy and robustness in projecting cancer incidence rates.

A unique aspect of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is its stroma; rich in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and a dense CAF-generated extracellular matrix (ECM). These pathogenic stroma CAF/ECM units cause the collapse of local blood vessels rendering the tumor microenvironment nutrient-poor. PDAC cells are able to survive this state of nutrient stress via support from CAF-secreted material, which includes small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The tumor-supportive CAFs possess a distinct phenotypic profile, compared to normal-like fibroblasts, expressing NetrinG1 (NetG1) at the plasma membrane, and active Integrin Œ±5Œ≤1 localized to the multivesicular bodies; traits indicative of poor patient survival. We herein report that NetG1+ CAFs secrete sEVs that stimulate Akt-mediated survival in nutrient-deprived PDAC cells, protecting them from undergoing apoptosis. Further, we show that NetG1 expression in CAFs is required for the pro-survival properties of sEVs.

Materials and Methods: Men ‚â•45 years of age with biopsy-confirmed unilateral Gleason grade group 2 (GGG2) adenocarcinoma of the prostate, prostate volume of 20-80 cc, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ‚â§15 ng/mL were enrolled. Cystoscopy and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance were used to deliver ‚àº103¬∞C water vapor to prostate zones for unilateral hemigland ablation, including destruction of cancers detected by multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and confirmed by biopsy. The primary outcomes were device-related serious adverse events (SAEs). At 7 days and 6 months postprocedure, the ablation extent was assessed by mpMRI; MRI/TRUS fusion biopsies were completed at 6 months. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed with validated questionnaires. Results: All subjects underwent a single hemigland TUVA procedure. No SAEs occurred. Grade 2 procedure-related AEs included transient urinary retention (n = 4) and erectile (n = 1) or ejaculatory dysfunction (n = 1). At 7 days, mpMRI revealed complete ablation of 14/17 (82%) visible lesions. At 6 months, biopsies showed no Gleason pattern ‚â•4 or ‚â•GGG2 cancer on the treated side of prostates in 13/15 (87%) subjects. Ten of 15 (67%) subjects were biopsy negative. Of the 5 biopsy-negative subjects, 2 had one core each of 3 + 4 disease and 3 had one core each of 3 + 3 disease with ‚â§5% involvement. Median prostate volume was reduced by 40.7% and PSA by 58%. Extensive QOL assessments showed, on average, no appreciable negative effects of treatment. Conclusions: Initial evidence suggests that TUVA is safe in men with intermediate-risk PCa.

This study aims to construct a classification and regression tree (CART) model (i.e., risk stratification algorithm) using multivariable approach to select Vietnamese men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) for PCa biopsy.  Methods:   We conducted a case-control study on 260 men aged ‚â• 50 years who visited MEDIC Medical Center, Vietnam in 2017-2018 with self-reported LUTS. The case group included patients with a positive biopsy and the control group included patients with a negative biopsy diagnosis of PCa. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was used for selecting the most parsimonious prediction model. Then the CART with 5-fold cross-validation was constructed for selecting men who can benefit from PCa biopsy in steps by steps and intuitive way.  Results:   BMA suggested five potential prediction models, in which the most parsimonious model including PSA, I-PSS, and age. CART advised the following cut-off points in the marked screening sequence: 18 < PSA < 33.5 ng/mL, I-PSS ‚â• 19, and age ‚â• 71. Patients with PSA ‚â• 33.5 ng/mL have a PCa risk was 91.2%; patients with PSA < 18 ng/mL and I-PSS < 19 have a PCa risk was 7.1%. Patient with 18 ‚â§ PSA < 33.5ng/mL and I-PSS < 19 have a PCa risk is 70% if age ‚â• 71; and is 16% if age < 71. In overall, CART reached high predictive value with AUC = 0.915. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of CART at the 20% diagnosis probability threshold were 91.5%, 86.2%, 86.9%, 91.2%, and 88.9% respectively; at 80% diagnosis probability threshold were 79.2%, 92.3%, 91.2%, 81.6%, and 85.8% respectively.

Mast cell density (MCD) may vary depending on its location in the tumor and tumor vascularity. MCD may influence the tumor aggressiveness.  Aims:   This study evaluates MCD and tumor vascularity in different histopathological grades of adenocarcinoma prostate.  Settings and design:   Descriptive study with purposive sampling.  Methods and material:   The subjects of study were 42 adenocarcinoma patients. 20 cases were of intermediate grade (Gleason score 2-7) and 22 were of high-grade (Gleason score 8-10). Histological diagnosis was made by examining sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Additional sections from the same block were stained for mast cells using Giemsa stains as per standard protocol. Mast cell count was done in minimum six random high-power microscopy fields in four different regions- intratumoral, peritumoral, stromal and perivascular regions.  Statistical analysis used:   SSPS software version 13.0. Descriptive statistics, Student's t test and ANOVA test.  Results:   In high-grade adenocarcinoma, mast cell counts were higher in perilesional, stromal and perivascular regions, whereas it was lower in intralesional areas as compared to the intermediate grade. However, statistical significance was observed only for the perivascular region. There was significantly higher number of blood vessels in high-grade adenocarcinoma as compared to intermediate grade adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   In this study, perilesional mast cells and vascularity increased with increased severity of adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest a possible influence of mast cells on the tumor microenvironment such as vessel density and aggressiveness of tumor. However, further studies are required to substantiate results of this study.""","""['Bismay Das', 'Susan M Mendonca']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Indian J Pathol Microbiol""","""['Immunohistological analysis of mast cell numbers in the intratumoral and peritumoral regions of prostate carcinoma compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Relationship of mast cell density with lymphangiogenesis and prognostic parameters in breast carcinoma.', 'The distribution of mast cells in benign and malignant prostate lesions and its biologic significance.', 'Histopathology of Prostate Cancer.', 'Best practices recommendations in the application of immunohistochemistry in the prostate: report from the International Society of Urologic Pathology consensus conference.']"""

Methods:   SEER-Medicare combines cancer registry data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programme with Medicare claims. Our population-based case-control study included incident cancer cases diagnosed between 1992-2015: prostate (n = 130,713), lung (n = 105,466), colorectal (n = 56,433), bladder (n = 38,873), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 17,854), melanoma (n = 14,241), and oesophageal (n = 9116). We selected 100,000 controls from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries and used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   TT was associated with lower risk of distant-stage prostate cancer (injection/implantation OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.86; topical OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.24-1.03).

Risks of distant-stage colorectal and prostate cancers decreased with time after initiating TT by injection/implantation. By contrast, TT was positively associated with distant-stage melanoma (injection/implantation OR = 1.70, 95% CI: 1.37-2.11). TT was not associated with bladder cancer, oesophageal cancer, lung cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.  Conclusion:   TT was inversely associated with distant-stage prostate and colorectal cancers but was positively associated with distant-stage melanoma.

Assessing the effects of national efforts may help guide future initiatives in curtailing low-value care. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the Choosing Wisely campaign on imaging utilization among men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results - Medicare data were used to complete a longitudinal population-based study of men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2007 to 2015. An interrupted time series analysis evaluated the impact of the Choosing Wisely campaign on trends of imaging utilization.  Results:   From 2007 to 2015 imaging utilization in low-risk patients decreased, with computed tomography (CT) usage declining from 45.0% to 34.4% (P<0.001) and nuclear medicine bone scan (NMBS) from 27.8% to 11.7% (P<0.001). Choosing Wisely likely contributed to an absolute reduction of 2.9% (P=0.03) in utilization of NMBS in the low-risk population. Imaging usage for all modalities increased in the high-risk population, but with 32.8% continuing to not receive guideline-supported imaging.  Conclusions:   In 2012, the Choosing Wisely campaign sought to decrease inappropriate staging imaging for men with low-risk prostate cancer and encourage stewardship of medical resources. Overall decreases in staging imaging trends suggest a move towards higher value care. However, this study found that the Choosing Wisely recommendations had a modest impact on utilization of NMBS, but not CT or PET scans. These results may help inform future efforts to promote guideline concordant imaging.""","""['Suzanne M Lange', 'Mouneeb M Choudry', 'Trevor C Hunt', 'Jacob P Ambrose', 'Benjamin A Haaland', 'William T Lowrance', 'Heidi A Hanson', ""Brock B O'Neil""]""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Regional-Level Correlations in Inappropriate Imaging Rates for Prostate and Breast Cancers: Potential Implications for the Choosing Wisely Campaign.', 'Five-year trends of bone scan and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography utilization in prostate cancer: A retrospective review in a private centre.', 'Clinical Impact of ASCO Choosing Wisely Guidelines on Staging Imaging for Early-Stage Breast Cancers: A Time Series Analysis Using SEER-Medicare Data.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Primary Staging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Health disparities and inequities in the utilization of diagnostic imaging for prostate cancer.']"""

However, it has yet to be tested in men undergoing external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), for whom assessing PCa progression risk could inform decisions on treatment intensity. We analyzed whether GPS results are associated with time to biochemical failure (BCF), DM, and PCD after EBRT in men with localized PCa and whether the association is modified by race.  Methods and materials:   We conducted a retrospective study of men with localized PCa treated with EBRT at the VA Health Care System in Durham, NC from 2000 to 2016. Study endpoints were time to BCF per the Phoenix criteria, DM, and PCD. The association of GPS results, per 20-unit increase or dichotomous variable (0-40 vs 41-100), was evaluated with each endpoint using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Results were then stratified by race.  Results:   A total of 238 patients (69% Black) met the eligibility criteria. Median follow-up for patients who did not experience BCF was 7.6 years. GPS results per 20-unit increase were significantly associated with BCF (hazard ratio [HR], 3.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.59-5.02), DM (HR, 4.48; 95% CI, 2.75-7.38), and PCD (HR, 5.36; 95% CI, 3.06-9.76) in univariable analysis. GPS results remained significant in multivariable models adjusted for baseline clinical and pathological factors, with HRs being similar to the univariable analysis. There was no significant interaction between the GPS assay and race (P = .923). HRs for BCF were similar in Black men (HR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.40-6.24) versus non-Black men (HR, 4.01; 95% CI, 2.42-6.45).

Methods:   The retrospective study included 121 patients with negative mpMRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2.1 category<3) performed at our institution between 2012 and 2017 without known biopsy proven PCa. Clinical and pathological data were collated including post-MRI prostatic tissue diagnoses with highest Grade Group and most recent prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels up to any definitive prostate cancer treatment. Mean PSA velocities between patients with and without a subsequent diagnosis of Grade Group 2 or higher (GG2+) PCa were compared, and an optimal threshold value was calculated.  Results:   Outcome data available included PSA values in 117 patients and prostate tissue sampling in 52 patients. Over a median follow up interval of 49.8 months, only 11 of 121 patients (9.1%) were diagnosed with GG2+ PCa, 10 patients (8.3%) with GG1 PCa, and 31 patients (25.6%) had negative prostate tissue samples.

These hypotheses rely on the sensitivity and specificity of screening tests, but they have not been verified.  Methods:   We performed a cross-sectional analysis of outpatients age ‚â• 70 years with prostate, breast, colorectal, or lung cancer included in the ELCAPA cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02884375) between February 2007 and December 2019. The diagnostic accuracy of the G8 Geriatric Screening Tool (G8) and modified G8 scores for identifying unfit patients was determined on the basis of GA results. We used decision curve analysis to calculate the benefit of frailty screening for detecting unfit patients and avoiding unnecessary GA in fit patients across different threshold probabilities.  Results:   We included 1,648 patients (median age, 81 years), and 1,428 (87%) were unfit. The sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 85% (95% CI, 84 to 87) and 59% (95% CI, 57 to 61) for G8, and 86% (95% CI, 84 to 87) and 60% (95% CI, 58 to 63) for the modified G8 score. For decision curve analysis, the net benefit (NB) for identifying unfit patients were 0.72 for G8, 0.72 for the modified G8, and 0.82 for GA at a threshold probability of 0.25. At a threshold probability of 0.33, the NBs were 0.71, 0.72, and 0.80, respectively. At a threshold probability of 0.5, the NBs were 0.68, 0.69, and 0.73, respectively. No screening tool reduced unnecessary GA in fit patients at predefined threshold probabilities.

Postoperatively, urologists perform cystography before removing urinary catheters due to concerns about the integrity of the vesicourethral anastomosis. This study aims to evaluate the safety of waiving cystography before early catheter removal after RARP.  Methods:   A total of 514 patients from two tertiary referral centers who underwent RARP were retrospectively included. Patients received postoperative urinary drainage by transurethral (TUC) or suprapubic catheter (SPC). During the first year, both centers performed routine cystography before removing TUC or SPC on postoperative day 5. In the following year, management changed and catheters were removed without cystography unless indicated by the surgeon. Demographic and perioperative data were analyzed. Postoperative complications and readmission rates were compared between standard cystography (StCG), no cystography (NCG), and selective cystography (SCG).  Results:   Groups were comparable regarding demographic and oncological parameters. Analysis showed no significant difference regarding major complications and readmission rates between standard and no cystography (p = 0.155 and 0.998 respectively). Omitting routine cystography did not lead to inferior postoperative courses regardless of both urinary drainage used and tumor stage. Subgroup analysis showed an increase of major complications in SCG patients when compared with NCG (p = 0.003) while readmissions remained comparable (p = 0.554).  Conclusion:   Waiving routine cystography before early catheter removal after RARP appears to be safe and feasible regardless of urinary drainage.

Our mechanistic study further reveals that SPP1 regulates the expression of PSMA through the transcription factor HIF1Œ±. Moreover, SPP1 promotes HUVEC migration and tube formation. In addition, HIF1Œ± knockdown reduces the expression of PSMA in HUVECs and blocks the ability of SPP1 to promote HUVEC migration and tube formation. We further confirm that SPP1 is abundantly expressed in GBM, is associated with poor prognosis, and has high clinical diagnostic value with considerable sensitivity and specificity.

The additional aim of this study is to compare two moderately HSRT schedules. Patients treated to prostate bed with daily Image Guided-VMAT and a total dose of 65 Gy/26 fractions (Group A) or 66 Gy/30 fractions (Group B) were included in the study. Inclusion criteria were: pN0/pNx, pre-HSRT PSA ‚â•0.2 ng/ml and ‚â§1 ng/ml, no evidence of pelvic/extrapelvic disease at restaging, no pelvic irradiation or dose boost on macroscopic local recurrence, no neoadjuvant/concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT), follow-up ‚â•36 months, and available pre/post HSRT data.

To assess pelvic floor integrity after RARP, we recently proposed Uroflow Stop Test (UST) with surface electromyography (EMG).  Aim:   Here we provide two new clinical parameters: the neurologic latency time (NLT) and the urologic latency time (ULT) derived from UST-EMG Test. Principal outcome was to evaluate their variation during one year follow-up and ULT ability to predict post-RARP UI.  Design:   Observational and longitudinal study.  Setting:   Interdivisional Urology Clinic (Perugia-Terni, Italy).  Population:   Patients with prostate cancer treated with a full nerve-sparing RARP who underwent postoperative pelvic floor muscles training (PFMT): a diurnal functional home program and a weekly hospital program with the use of biofeedback, between 1 and 3 months postoperatively.  Methods:   All patients consecutively performed a UST-EMG test at one, three, six, and twelve months after surgery. At each follow-up visit we collected NLT values, ULT values, 5-item 26-Expanded Prostate Cancer Index (EPIC), Incontinence Developed on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ-UI) Short Form and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). We analysed statistically significant differences in NLT and ULT between continent and incontinent patients and we evaluate the diagnostic ability of 1-month post-surgery ULT value to diagnose the presence of postoperative UI.  Results:   Sixty patients were enrolled. The mean time to PFMT was 31.08 (range: 30-35) days. Overall IPSS, NLT and ULT had similar trends: progressive decrease until the six months after surgery (1-month vs. 3 months vs. 6 months, P<0.05) to plateau thereafter. When considering the two group of patients, IPSS and NLT were significantly higher in the incontinent group only one month after surgery, while ULT became similar between the two groups at 6 months after surgery. The best cut-off of 1-month ULT values that maximized the Youden function at 12-months resulted 3.13 second.  Conclusions:   NLT and ULT may respectively account for the nerve and the urethral closure system integrity post-RARP. In the first month after RARP, both NLT and ULT differs between incontinent vs. continent patients.

In this report we broadly examine the incidence of 14 types of cancer, with a focus on digestive, respiratory, and hormonal cancers, in the United Auto Workers-General Motors (UAW-GM) cohort, a cohort of workers exposed to MWFs (1973-2015). The cohort included 39,132 workers followed for cancer incidence. Cox models yielded estimates of adjusted hazard ratios, with categorical variables for lagged cumulative exposure to 3 types of MWF (straight, soluble, and synthetic). We fitted penalized splines to examine the shape of the exposure-response relationships. There were 7,809 incident cancer cases of interest. Oil-based straight and soluble MWFs were each modestly associated with all cancers combined. Exposure-response patterns were consistent with prior reports from this cohort, and results for splined exposures generally reflected their categorically modeled counterparts. We found significantly increased incidence of stomach and kidney cancer with higher levels of straight MWF exposure and increased rectal and prostate cancer with increasing water-based synthetic MWF exposure. Only non-Hodgkin lymphoma and prostate cancer were associated with soluble MWF. All results for colon and lung cancers were null.

Little is known about the optimal template of such sLND in patients with strictly unilateral pelvic recurrence on PET-CT imaging. In this study, we investigated whether a unilateral pelvic sLND could be sufficient in such a setting.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected data of patients treated with sLND between 2010 and 2019 at the University Hospitals, Leuven. Patients were included if they developed recurrence following radical prostatectomy, characterized by ‚â§3 unilateral pelvic lymph node metastases on Choline or PSMA PET-CT and received a super-extended bilateral pelvic sLND as first metastasis-directed therapy. As a primary endpoint, we investigated in how many cases a unilateral sLND would have been sufficient.  Results:   In total, 44 patients with strictly unilateral pelvic recurrence were treated with super-extended bilateral pelvic sLND. In 5 out of 44 (11%) patients, histological examination showed presence of prostate cancer in the contralateral hemi-pelvis. In the group with a single positive node on imaging prior to sLND, only 1 out of 27 (3%) patients had contralateral disease at final pathology. No one (0%) in this group subsequently developed recurrence in the contralateral hemi-pelvis following sLND.

Ursolic acid (UA) is a natural triterpenoid possessing antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. However, how PTEN impacts metabolic rewiring and how UA modifies PTEN-driven metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. In the current study, we found that UA protects against PTEN knockout (KO)-induced tumorigenesis at different stages of PCa. Epigenomic CpG methyl-seq revealed UA attenuated PTEN KO-induced differentially methylated regions (DMRs) profiles. Transcriptomic RNA-seq showed UA abrogated PTEN KO-induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of PCa-related oncogenes' Has3, Cfh, and Msx1 overexpression, indicating UA plays a crucial role in PTEN KO-mediated gene regulation and its potential consequences on cancer interception. Association analysis of DEGs and DMRs identified that the mRNA expression of tumor suppressor gene BDH2, and oncogenes Ephas, Isg15, and Nos2 were correlated with the promoter CpG methylation status in the early-stage comparison groups indicating UA could regulate the oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes by modulating their promoter methylation at an early stage of prostate tumorigenesis. The metabolomic study showed UA attenuated PTEN KO-regulated cancer-associated metabolisms like purine metabolism/metabolites correlating with RNAseq findings, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis metabolism, as well as epigenetic-related metabolites pyruvate and lactate indicating UA plays a critical role in PTEN KO-mediated metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming and its consequences on cancer development. In this context, UA impacts metabolic rewiring causing epigenetic and transcriptomic reprogramming potentially contributing to the overall protection against prostate-specific PTEN KO-mediated PCa.""","""['Lujing Wang', 'Chao Wang', 'Md Shahid Sarwar', 'Pochung Chou', 'Yujue Wang', 'Xiaoyang Su', 'Ah-Ng Tony Kong']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['Triterpenoid ursolic acid drives metabolic rewiring and epigenetic reprogramming in treatment/prevention of human prostate cancer.', 'Nfe2l2 Regulates Metabolic Rewiring and Epigenetic Reprogramming in Mediating Cancer Protective Effect by Fucoxanthin.', 'Proteomic and transcriptomic profiling of Pten gene-knockout mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase, a PTEN-functional homologue in prostate epithelia, functions as a prostate-specific tumor suppressor.', 'Clinical Utility and Biologic Implications of Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) and ETS-related Gene (ERG) in Prostate Cancer.', 'Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'The environmental carcinogen benzoapyrene regulates epigenetic reprogramming and metabolic rewiring in a two-stage mouse skin carcinogenesis model.']"""

For clinical applications of CTCs, simple, high-throughput, single-step CTC isolation from whole blood without red blood cell (RBC) lysis and centrifugation remains a crucial challenge. In this study, we developed a novel cancer cell separation chip, ""hybrid double-spiral chip"", that involves the serial combination of two different Dean flow fractionation (DFF) separation modes of half and full Dean cycles, which is the hybrid DFF separation mode for ultra-high-throughput blood processing at high precision and size-resolution separation. The chip allows fast processing of 5 mL whole blood within 30 min without RBC lysis and centrifugation. RBC and white blood cell (WBC) depletion rates of over 99.9% and 99%, respectively, were achieved. The average recovery rate of spiked A549 cancer cells was 87% with as low as 200 cells in 5 mL blood. The device can achieve serial reduction in the number of cells from approximately 1010 cells of whole blood to 108 cells, and subsequently to an order of 106 cells. The developed method can be combined with measurements of all recovered cells using imaging flow cytometry. As proof of concept, CTCs were successfully enriched and enumerated from the blood of metastatic breast cancer patients (N = 10, 1-69 CTCs per 5 mL) and metastatic prostate cancer patients (N = 10, 1-39 CTCs per 5 mL).

However, there was no pan-cancer analysis between LZTR1 and human tumors reported before. Therefore, we are the first to investigate the potential oncogenic roles of LZTR1 across all tumor types based on the datasets of TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus). LZTR1 plays a double-edged role in tumor development and prognosis. We found that the high expression of LZTR1 brings better outcomes in esophageal carcinoma (ESCA) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) but brings worth outcomes in uveal melanoma (UVM), adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Moreover, the expression of LZTR1 also strongly associated with pathological in ACC and bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA). We also found that the LZTR1 expression was associated with some immune cell infiltration including endothelial cells, regulatory T cells (Tregs), T cell CD8+, natural killer cells (NK cell), macrophages, neutrophil granulocyte, and cancer-associated fibroblasts in different cancers. Missense mutation in LZTR1 was detected in most cancers from TCGA datasets. Finally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Body (GO) method was used to explain the pathogenesis of LZTR1.

To determine the most likely compound that can bind to the STEAP2 protein, we docked the modeled STEAP2 3D structure against 2466 FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved drug candidates using AutoDock Vina. Protein basic local alignment search tool (BLASTp) search, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), and phylogenetics were further carried out to analyze the diversity of this marker and determine its conserved domains as suitable target regions. Six promising drug candidates (ligands) were identified. Triptorelin had the highest binding energy (-12.1 kcal/mol) followed by leuprolide (docking energy: -11.2 kcal/mol). All the top two drug candidates interacted with residues Ser-372 and Gly-369 in close proximity with the iron-binding domain (an important catalyst of metal reduction).

Methods:   We surveyed 402 patients with localized prostate cancer participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing specialist versus primary care-based follow-up. For the current study, we used patient-reported data at the time of the first follow-up visit at the hospital, prior to randomization. We assessed patients' ratings of the quality of follow-up care using the Assessment of Patient Experiences of Cancer Care survey. This survey includes 13 scales about different aspects of care and an overall rating of care. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with perceived follow-up quality.  Results:   Patients reported positive experiences at first follow-up for 9 of 13 scales, with mean (M) scores ranging from 79 to 97 (on a 0-100 response scale). Patients reported most frequently (over 70%) suboptimal care regarding symptom management (84%; M = 44, SD = 37), health promotion (75%; M = 45, SD = 39), and physician's knowledge about patients' life (84%; M = 65, SD = 23). Overall, patients' lower quality of follow-up ratings were associated with younger age, higher education level, having more than one comorbid condition, having undergone primary surgery, and experiencing significant symptoms.  Conclusion:   Patients with prostate cancer are generally positive about their initial, hospital-based follow-up care.
