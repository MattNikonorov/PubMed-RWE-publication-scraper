Preserving nerves and muscle adjacent to prostate cancer risks positive surgical margins. Advanced imaging with MRI has improved cancer localization but limitations exist.  Objective:   To measure the accuracy for assessing extra-prostatic extension at nerve bundles for 2 PSMA-PET tracers and to compare the PET accuracy to standard-of-care predictors including MRI and biopsy results.  Materials and methods:   We studied men with PSMA-targeted PET imaging, performed prior to prostatectomy in men largely with intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer, and retrospectively evaluated for assessment of extra-prostatic extension with whole-mount analysis as reference standard. Two different PSMA-PET tracers were included: 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-P16-093. Blinded reviews of the PET and MRI scans were performed to assess extra-prostatic extension (EPE). Sensitivity and specificity for extra-prostatic extension were compared using McNemar's Chi2.  Results:   Pre-operative PSMA-PET imaging was available for 71 patients with either 68Ga-P16-093 (n = 25) or 68Ga-PSMA-11 (n = 46). There were 24 (34%) with pT3a (EPE) and 16 (23%) with pT3b (SVI). EPE Sensitivity (87% vs. 92%), Specificity (77% vs. 76%), and ROC area (0.82 vs. 0.84) were similar between P16-093 and PSMA-11, respectively (P = 0.87). MRI (available in only 45) found high specificity (83%) but low sensitivity (60%) for EPE when using a published grading system. MRI sensitivity was significantly lower than the PSMA-PET (60% vs. 90%, P = 0.02), but similar to PET when using a >5 mm capsular contact (76% vs. 90%, P = 0.38). A treatment change to ""nerve sparing"" was recommended in 21 of 71 (30%) patients based on PSMA-PET imaging.  Conclusions:   Presurgical PSMA-PET appeared useful as a tool for surgical planning, changing treatment plans in men with ≥4+3 or multi-core 3+4 prostate cancer resulting in preservation of nerve-bundles.""","""['Clinton D Bahler', 'Mark A Green', 'Mark A Tann', 'Jordan K Swensson', 'Katrina Collins', 'David Alexoff', 'Hank Kung', 'Eric Brocken', 'Carla J Mathias', 'Liang Cheng', 'Gary D Hutchins', 'Michael O Koch']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric MRI versus 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI for Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of preoperative locoregional Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET-CT and mp-MRI results with postoperative histopathology of prostate cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Role of Positron Emission Tomography With (68)Gallium (Ga)-Labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) in the Management of Patients With Organ-confined and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Prior to Radical Treatment and After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A prospective head-to-head comparison of 68GaGa-P16-093 and 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in patients with primary prostate cancer.']"""

Identifying the direct molecular drivers and developing pharmacological strategies using clinical-grade inhibitors to overcome lineage transition-induced therapeutic resistance are imperative. Here, using single-cell multiomics analyses, we investigate the dynamics of cellular heterogeneity, transcriptome regulation, and microenvironmental factors in 107,201 cells from genetically engineered mouse prostate cancer samples with complete time series of tumor evolution seen in patients. We identify that FOXA2 orchestrates prostate cancer adeno-to-neuroendocrine lineage transition and that Foxa2 expression is significantly induced by androgen deprivation. Moreover, Foxa2 knockdown induces the reversal of adeno-to-neuroendocrine transition. The KIT pathway is directly regulated by FOXA2 and specifically activated in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Pharmacologic inhibition of KIT pathway significantly suppresses mouse and human NEPC tumor growth.

Methods:   In this work, a deep learning network for Gleason grading of prostate cancer is proposed based on EfficientNet architecture. It applies a compound scaling method to balance the dimensions of the underlying network. Also, an additional attention branch is added to EfficientNet-B7 for precise feature weighting.  Result:   To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that integrates an additional attention branch with EfficientNet architecture for Gleason grading.

Patients and methods:   Initiated in 2017, IRONMAN (International Registry for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer) is a prospective cohort of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The study will enroll 5,000 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) or castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), recruited from Australia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Jamaica, Kenya, Nigeria, Norway, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The study is collecting datatypes to study variation in care and treatment of advanced prostate cancer across countries and across academic, community-based, and government practices with a focus on clinical outcomes, patient-reported outcomes, epidemiologic data, biologic subtypes, and clinician questionnaires.  Results:   Through July 2022, 2,682 eligible patients were enrolled in 11 of 12 active countries. Sixty-six percent of patients have mHSPC, and 34% have CRPC. On the basis of self-report, 11% of patients are Black and 9% are Hispanic. Five Veterans Affairs Medical Centers are enrolling patients. Globally, 23% of patients report being veterans of military service.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first international cohort of people newly diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer designed to describe variations in patient management, experiences, and outcomes. IRONMAN aims to identify optimal treatment sequences to improve survival, understand patient-reported outcomes, and explore novel biomarkers to understand treatment resistance mechanisms. Insights from IRONMAN will inform and guide future clinical management of people with mHSPC and CRPC.

In mouse models, orthotopic tumors are favored for their biological relevance and simulation of growth in a microenvironment akin to that found in humans. However, to monitor the disease course, animal models require consistent and noninvasive surveillance. In vivo bioluminescent imaging has become a mainstay imaging modality due to its flexibility and ease of use. However, with some orthotopic prostate tumor models, bioluminescence fails to describe disease progression due to optical scattering and signal attenuation. CT scanning, in addition to its utility in human cancer diagnosis and surveillance, can be applied to mouse models with improved results. However, CT imaging has poor definition when imaging soft tissues and is not routinely used in prostate cancer models. Using an orthotopic prostate cancer model, our results demonstrate that, when compared to bioluminescent imaging, CT imaging correlates more closely to orthotopic prostate tumor growth in mice. Based on the data from this study, we conclude that CT imaging can be used as an alternative to the more commonly used bioluminescent imaging for measuring orthotopic prostate cancer growth over time.""","""['Molly S Myers', 'Elizabeth A Kosmacek', 'Arpita Chatterjee', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Longitudinal measurement of subcutaneous and intratibial human prostate cancer xenograft growth and response to ionizing radiation by plasma Alu and LINE-1 ctDNA: A comparison to standard methods.', 'Optimizing live-animal bioluminescence imaging prediction of tumor burden in human prostate cancer xenograft models in SCID-NSG mice.', 'A Multimodality Image Guided Precision Radiation Research Platform: Integrating X-ray, Bioluminescence, and Fluorescence Tomography With Radiation Therapy.', 'Establishment of an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft mouse model using microscope-guided orthotopic injection of LNCaP cells into the dorsal lobe of the mouse prostate.', 'A novel mouse model of human prostate cancer to study intraprostatic tumor growth and the development of lymph node metastases.', 'Quantitative Assessment on Optical Properties as a Basis for Bioluminescence Imaging: An Experimental and Numerical Approach to the Transport of Optical Photons in Phantom Materials.']"""

Aseptic TP-BX may be performed, significantly reducing the risk of infection. We described the first Danish experience with multiparametric MRI-guided freehand TP-BX.  Methods:   Men scheduled for TP-BX were included. Patient age, prostate-specific antigen level, previous biopsy history, weight and height were recorded. We employed a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the various procedure parts and the patients rated their satisfaction. Complications and International Society of Urological Pathology scores were recorded and cancer detection rates calculated.  Results:   A total of 143 men had TP-BX performed in a consecutive series.

The results indicate that the use of Zn-doped IONs significantly enhances T2-weighted MRI signal intensity of orthotopic prostate tumor with low toxicity, which is beneficial for the accurate diagnosis of orthotopic tumor.

It was demonstrated that Sev augmented macrophage M2 polarization and migratory and invasive potential of PCa cells as well as lung metastasis, which was associated with HO-1 upregulation. Mechanistic investigation indicated that Sev elevated IL-6 expression to enhance HO-1 expression. In vivo experiments verified that Sev facilitated macrophage M2 polarization and lung metastasis of RM-1 cells via IL-6/HO-1 in mice. Taken together, our work reveals a novel IL-6/HO-1-mediated regulatory network underlying Sev function that may be a viable target for preventing lung metastasis of PCa.""","""['Fang Yu', 'Tao Bai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int Immunopharmacol""","""['YY1 complex in M2 macrophage promotes prostate cancer progression by upregulating IL-6.', 'IL-6 produced by prostate epithelial cells stimulated with Trichomonas vaginalis\xa0promotes proliferation of prostate cancer cells by inducing M2 polarization of THP-1-derived macrophages.', 'Sevoflurane attenuates pulmonary inflammation and ventilator-induced lung injury by upregulation of HO-1 mRNA expression in mice.', 'M2 polarization of macrophages by Oncostatin M in hypoxic tumor microenvironment is mediated by mTORC2 and promotes tumor growth and metastasis.', 'P2Y11/IL-1 receptor crosstalk controls macrophage inflammation: a novel target for anti-inflammatory strategies?']"""

Secondary objectives:   To assess the concordance between 18F-Choline PET/CT and conventional study and to find related prognostic factors.  Material and methods:   Retrospective observational study of 78 patients with high-risk PC undergoing 18F-Choline PET/CT after conventional initial staging (CT + BS). Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of 18F-Choline PET/CT and CT + BS were calculated. The golden standard was histological result or follow-up. Tumor characteristics were collected and univariate and multivariate analyzes were performed.  Results:   The median age was 67 years old and mean PSA was 42.39 ng/mL. The sensitivity, specificity and NPV in global initial staging for PET/CT 18F-Choline and conventional imaging were: 92.9% vs 38.5%, 83.3% vs 42.3%, and 90.9% vs 40.7%, respectively. Lymph node staging: sensitivity 96.3% vs 61.5% and specificity 80% vs 76%, respectively. Bone staging: sensitivity 91.7% vs 21.4% and specificity 97.4% vs 83.8%, respectively. There was agreement in 25 patients (32%) (p = 0.004), Kappa index 0.134 (p = 0.011). The treatment was modified in 47.4% patients. PSA, PSADT% positive cores and cT were related to PET results. PSA level <8.9 ng/mL was considered an independent protective factor for positive PET (OR 0.03) (95% CI: 0.002-0.435, p 0.010).  Conclusions: 18F-Choline PET/CT seems to be superior to CT + BS for initial staging in high-risk PC.

Therefore, the accurate prediction of prognostic-related risk factors in middle-aged high-risk PC patients between 50 and 65 can help reduce patient mortality. We aimed to construct new nomograms for predicting cancer-specific survival (CSS) and Overall survival (OS) in middle-aged high-risk PC patients.  Methods:   Data for patients aged between 50 and 65 years old and diagnosed with high-risk PC were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for CSS and OS in patients. Nomograms predicting CSS and OS were developed based on multivariate Cox regression models. The concordance index (C-index), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the calibration curve are used to detect the accuracy and discrimination of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) is used to detect the potential clinical value of this model.  Results:   Between 2010 and 2018, 1,651 patients diagnosed with high-risk PC and aged 50-65 years were included. In this study, the training group (n = 1,146) and the validation group (n = 505) were randomly assigned in a ratio of 7:3. The results showed that M stage, Gleason (GS) and surgical mode were independent risk factors for CSS; marital status, T stage, M stage, surgical mode, and GS were independent risk factors for OS. The C-index for predicting CSS in the training and validation groups are 0.84 and 0.811, respectively; the C-index for predicting OS in the training and validation groups are 0.824 and 0.784, respectively.

MiR-153, as a member of the microRNA (miRNA) family, plays an important role in PC. This study aims to explore the expression and possible molecular mechanisms of the miR-153 action.  Methods:   Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues were collected from prostatectomy specimens of 29 metastatic and 32 initial stage PC patients. Expression levels of miR-153 were measured using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). 2-ΔΔCT method was used for quantitative gene expression assessment. The candidate target genes for miR-153 were predicted by TargetScan. Mutations in target genes of miR-153 were identified using exome sequencing. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms of miR-153 in PC.  Results:   MiR-153 was significantly up-regulated in PC tissues compared to non-cancerous tissues. The analysis of correlation between the expression level of miR-153 and clinicopathological factors revealed a statistically significant correlation with the stage of the tumor process according to tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system (p = 0.0256). ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive ability of miR-153 for metastasis development and it revealed miR-153 as a potential prognostic marker (AUC = 0.85; 95%CI 0.75-0.95; sensitivity = 0.72, specificity = 0.86)). According to logistic regression model the high expression of miR-153 increased the risk of metastasis development (odds ratios = 3.14, 95% CI 1.62-8.49; p-value = 0.006). Whole exome sequencing revealed nonsynonymous somatic mutations in collagen type IV alpha 1 (COL4A1), collagen type IV alpha 3 (COL4A3), forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase 1 (HACL1), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1A), and nidogen 2 (NID2) genes.

Methods:   RNA from 78 Hispanic PCa tissues from radical prostatectomies (RP) were used for RNA-sequencing. ERGhigh /ERGlow tumor groups were determined based on the 1.5-fold change median expression in non-tumor samples. DEGs with a False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 0.01 and a fold change >2 were identified between ERGhigh and ERGlow tumors and submitted to enrichment analysis in MetaCore. Survival and association analyses were performed to evaluate biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival.  Results:   The identification of 150 DEGs between ERGhigh and ERGlow tumors revealed clustering of most of the non-BCR cases (60%) into de ERGhigh group and most of the BCR cases (60.8%) in ERGlow group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a worst BCR-free survival for ERGlow patients, and a significant reduced risk of BCR was observed for ERGhigh cases (OR = 0.29 (95%CI, 0.10-0.8)). Enrichment pathway analysis identified metabolic-related pathways, such as the renin-angiotensin system and angiotensin maturation system, the linoleic acid metabolism, and polyamines metabolism in these ERG groups.  Conclusions:   ERGlow tumor cases were associated with poor BCR-free survival in our Hispanic/Latino patients, with metabolism-related pathways altered in the BCR progression.

Many articles reported its usefulness with the advent of robotic surgery in 2001. However, epidural analgesia is declining due to the spread of minimally invasive treatment. There have been no studies using nationwide databases on the impact of epidural analgesia use on length of hospital stay and medical costs. Therefore, we used a Japanese national inpatient database from April 2016 to March 2020. The study population included 46,166 patients. We compared a postoperative analgesia management group using epidural analgesia [Epidural Analgesia Group (EA Group): 5,354] and a group not using epidural analgesia [non-Epidural Analgesia Group (non-EA Group): 40,812]. We found significant differences among the two groups regarding the length of stay, days from surgery to discharge, and inpatient cost of surgery to discharge. Hospital length of stay and postoperative hospital stay was statistically shorter in the EA group than in the non-EA group (11.3 ± 2.8 days vs. 12.1 ± 3.1 days, p < 0.001 and 8.9 ± 2.5 days vs. 9.3 ± 2.7 days, p < 0.001), respectively, and medical costs were also significantly lower in the EA group (84,566 JPY vs. 294,277 JPY, p < 0.001). Also, the activities of daily living (ADL) assessment at discharge determined a considerably higher score in the EA group than in the non-EA groups. Epidural analgesia for postoperative pain management largely depends on each medical institution's treatment policy. However, epidural analgesia is declining due to the spread of minimally invasive treatment.

Among patients with a PSA of less than 2 ng/mL (mean, 0.42 ± 0.42 ng/mL), significantly higher FFS was seen in arm B than arm A at 36 mo (83.2% [95% CI, 70.0-91.0] vs. 66.5% [95% CI, 51.6-77.8], P < 0.001) and 48 mo (83.2% [95% CI, 70.0-91.0] vs. 56.2% [95% CI, 40.5-69.2], P < 0.001). No significant difference in FFS between study arms in patients with a PSA of at least 2 ng/mL was observed. Among patients with adverse pathology, significantly higher FFS was seen in arm B than arm A at 48 mo (68.9% [95% CI, 52.1-80.8] vs. 42.8% [95% CI, 26.2-58.3], P < 0.001) though not at the 36-mo follow-up. FFS was higher in patients without adverse pathology in arm B versus arm A (90.2% [95% CI, 65.9-97.5] vs. 73.1% [95% CI, 42.9-89.0], P = 0.006) at both 36 and 48 mo. Patients in whom ADT was intended in arm B had higher FFS than those in arm A, with the difference reaching statistical significance at 48 mo (65.2% [95% CI, 40.3-81.7] vs. 29.1 [95% CI, 6.5-57.2], P < 0.001). Patients without ADT intent in arm B had significantly higher FFS than patients in arm A at 36 mo (80.7% [95% CI, 64.9-90.0] vs. 68.0% [95% CI, 51.1-80.2]) and 48 mo (80.7% [95% CI, 64.9-90.0] vs. 58.6% [95% CI, 41.0-72.6]). Conclusion: The survival advantage due to the addition of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT to SRT planning is maintained regardless of the presence of adverse pathology or ADT intent. Including 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT to SRT leads to survival benefits in patients with a PSA of less than 2 ng/mL but not in patients with a PSA of 2 ng/mL or higher.""","""['Ismaheel O Lawal', 'Ashesh B Jani', 'Omotayo A Adediran', 'Subir Goyal', 'Olayinka A Abiodun-Ojo', 'Vishal R Dhere', 'Charles V Marcus', 'Shreyas S Joshi', 'Viraj A Master', 'Pretesh R Patel', 'Mark Goodman', 'Joseph W Shelton', 'Omer Kucuk', 'Bruce Hershatter', 'Bridget Fielder', 'Raghuveer K Halkar', 'David M Schuster']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT imaging versus conventional imaging alone to guide postprostatectomy salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer (EMPIRE-1): a single centre, open-label, phase 2/3 randomised controlled trial.', 'Impact of 18 F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Findings on Failure-Free Survival in Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer Following Salvage Radiation Therapy.', 'Changes in Management After 18F-DCFPyL PSMA PET in Patients Undergoing Postprostatectomy Radiotherapy, with Early Biochemical Response Outcomes.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, better methods to evaluate response to HIFU ablation are an unmet need. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors are both overexpressed in PC. In this study, we evaluated a novel approach of using both 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI in each patient before and after HIFU to assess the accuracy of target tumor localization and response to treatment. Methods: Fourteen men, 64.5 ± 8.0 y old (range, 48-78 y), with newly diagnosed PC were prospectively enrolled. Before HIFU, the patients underwent prostate biopsy, multiparametric MRI, 68Ga-PSMA11, and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI. Response to treatment was assessed at a minimum of 6 mo after HIFU with prostate biopsy (n = 13), as well as 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI (n = 14). The SUVmax and SUVpeak of known or suspected PC lesions were collected. Results: Pre-HIFU biopsy revealed 18 cancers, of which 14 were clinically significant (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4). Multiparametric MRI identified 18 lesions; 14 of them were at least score 4 in the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System. 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI each showed 23 positive intraprostatic lesions; 21 were congruent in 13 patients, and 5 were incongruent in 5 patients. Before HIFU, 68Ga-PSMA11 identified all target tumors, whereas 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI missed 2 tumors. After HIFU, 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/MRI both identified clinically significant residual disease in 1 patient. Three significant ipsilateral recurrent lesions were identified, whereas 1 was missed by 68Ga-PSMA11. The pretreatment level of prostate-specific antigen decreased significantly after HIFU, by 66%. Concordantly, the pretreatment SUVmax decreased significantly after HIFU for 68Ga-PSMA11 (P = 0.001) and 68Ga-RM2 (P = 0.005). Conclusion: This pilot study showed that 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI identified the target tumor for HIFU in 100% and 86% of cases, respectively, and accurately verified response to treatment. PET may be a useful tool in the guidance and monitoring of treatment success in patients receiving focal therapy for PC. These preliminary findings warrant larger studies for validation.""","""['Heying Duan', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'Bruce Daniel', 'Jarrett Rosenberg', 'Guido A Davidzon', 'Carina Mari Aparici', 'Christian Kunder', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Andrei Iagaru']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['A Pilot Study of 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for Biopsy Guidance in Patients with Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Correlation of 68Ga-RM2 PET with Postsurgery Histopathology Findings in Patients with Newly Diagnosed Intermediate- or High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA- and GRPR-Targeted PET: Results from 50 Patients with Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'PET Imaging Using Gallium-68 (68Ga) RM2.', 'The use of advanced imaging in guiding the further investigation and treatment of primary prostate cancer.']"""

Methods: Thirty men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and second-generation androgen deprivation therapy were enrolled. All patients received up to 3 cycles of approximately 2.0 GBq (55 mCi) of 177Lu-EB-PSMA per cycle at 8-wk intervals. The primary endpoint was therapeutic safety, including changes in hematologic status, liver function, and renal function. An additional primary endpoint was therapeutic efficacy, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and molecular imaging response. The secondary endpoints were PSA progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Another endpoint was patient-reported health-related quality of life. Results: From January 2019 to December 2021, 30, 22, and 11 patients received 1, 2, or 3 cycles of 177Lu-EB-PSMA RLT, respectively. During the entire follow-up period, 33.3% of patients experienced grade 3 hematologic adverse events. Seventeen (56.7%) patients achieved a PSA reduction of at least 50%. The median PSA PFS was 4.6 mo (95% CI, 2.7-6.5 mo), and the median OS was 12.6 mo (95% CI, 8.1-17.1 mo). A higher whole-body PSMA SUVmean correlated with a better PSA response, higher baseline alkaline phosphatase and larger total PSMA-positive tumor volume were associated with worse PSA PFS, and the existence of visceral metastases and higher PSA value at baseline were significant prognosticators of worse OS. Health-related quality-of-life outcomes improved significantly after 177Lu-EB-PSMA RLT. Conclusion: RLT based on approximately 2.0 GBq of 177Lu-EB-PSMA for up to 3 cycles may achieve a PSA response and hematologic toxicity comparable to those from 7.4-GBq doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for up to 4-6 cycles.

Methods:   Prostate cancer patients were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (N = 103,059). Treatment trends were studied over time by prognostic risk groups. Multilevel analyses were applied to identify variables associated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) and brachy-monotherapy versus no active treatment in low-risk disease, and EBRT versus radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high-risk disease.  Results:   EBRT use remained stable (5-6%) in low-risk prostate cancer and increased from 21% to 32% in intermediate-risk, 37% to 45% in high-risk localized and 50% to 57% in high-risk locally advanced disease. Brachy-monotherapy decreased from 19% to 6% and from 15% to 10% in low and intermediate-risk disease, respectively, coinciding an increase of no active treatment from 55% to 73% in low-risk disease. Use of EBRT or brachy-monotherapy versus no active treatment in low-risk disease differed by region, T-stage and patient characteristics. Hospital characteristics were not associated with treatment in low-risk disease, except for availability of brachy-monotherapy in 2008-2013. Age, number of comorbidities, travel time for EBRT, prognostic risk group, and hospital characteristics were associated with EBRT versus prostatectomy in intermediate and high-risk disease.  Conclusion:   Intermediate/high-risk PCa was increasingly managed with EBRT, while brachy-monotherapy in low/intermediate-risk PCa decreased. In low-risk PCa, the no active treatment-approach increased. Variation in treatment suggests treatment decision related to patient/disease characteristics. In intermediate/high-risk disease, variation seems furthermore related to the treatment modalities available in the diagnosing hospitals.""","""['Jelle Evers', 'Linda G W Kerkmeijer', 'Roderick C N van den Bergh', 'Maurice J C van der Sangen', 'Maarten C C M Hulshof', 'Monique C W M Bloemers', 'Sabine Siesling', 'Mieke J Aarts', 'Katja K H Aben', 'Henk Struikmans']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Impact of Advanced External Beam Radiotherapy on Second Haematological Cancer Risk in Prostate Cancer Survivors.', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes Through 5 Years for Active Surveillance, Surgery, Brachytherapy, or External Beam Radiation With or Without Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy With a Brachytherapy Boost Versus Radical Prostatectomy in Gleason Pattern 5 Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', 'A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Management strategies for locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Changing nationwide trends away from overtreatment among patients undergoing radical prostatectomy over the past 25\xa0years.']"""

Prostate cancer antigen 3 (PCA3) as an alternative prostate tumor-specificity biomarker could be used to increase the specificity of PCa diagnosis, however, it usually required sophisticated operation and expensive equipment for routine detection. Herein, we constructed an early detection platform for prostate cancer with reverse transcriptase-recombinase aided amplification (RT-RAA) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 based nucleic acid test strip. The amplicons of PCA3 and kallikrein related peptidase 3 (KLK3) gene, which amplified simultaneously by single-amplification unit of RT-RAA were specifically recognized by Cas9-sgRNA and visual on the nucleic acid test strip by naked eyes without instruments. Simultaneously detection of PCA3 and KLK3 gene could improve specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis but avoid mutual interference. In addition, the platform presented a detection limit of 500 fg/μL and 50 fg/μL in PCA3 and KLK3 gene, respectively. Furthermore, the analysis result of signal ratio of PCA3 to KLK3 gene of urine and peripheral blood specimens from 32 men with suspected prostate cancer on test strips illustrated that the area under the curve values of urine and peripheral blood specimens were 0.998 and 1.0 respectively. In summary, our study highlighted a facile strategy to design an accurate prostate cancer gene detection platform which had the potential to conduct prostate cancer early detection in the resource-limited or other point-of-care testing (POCT) environments.""","""['Wenzhe Chen', 'Sicheng Wu', 'Guanlin Li', 'Xiaolu Duan', 'Xinyuan Sun', 'Shujue Li', 'Yan Zhao', 'Di Gu', 'Guohua Zeng', 'Hongxing Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Prostate Health Index (Phi) and Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3) significantly improve prostate cancer detection at initial biopsy in a total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml.', 'KLK3, PCA3, and TMPRSS2-ERG expression in the peripheral blood mononuclear cell fraction from castration-resistant prostate cancer patients and response to docetaxel treatment.', 'Expression of PCA3 and PSA genes as a biomarker for differential diagnosis of nodular hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'PCA3: from basic molecular science to the clinical lab.', 'The use of PCA3 in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

We enrolled in 1086 cases: MRI abnormalities were observed in 861 cases (79.3%). In these 861 cases, the adenocarcinoma detection rate, number of positive cores, and length of the highest Grade Group (GG) lesions were significantly higher. In the multivariate analysis, MRI abnormalities were the most significant factor for detecting adenocarcinoma of ≥GG 2 (odds ratio: 4.52, 95% confidence interval: 3.08-6.63). Targeted biopsy showed a higher percentage of positive cores with ≥GG2 and longer highest GG lesion lengths than systematic biopsy. Furthermore, the highest GG was upgraded in 109 of 788 cases by targeted biopsy. However, several adenocarcinomas (125/788; 15.9%) could not be detected using only targeted biopsy.

Also, the relationship between obesity and the aggressiveness of PCa has been established. However, it is unknown if the androgenic hormonal environment may alter the response of PCa cells to lipid availability.  Purpose:   The present study evaluated the effect of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in regulating lipid metabolism, and the interplay between this hormone and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in modulating PCa cells fate.  Methods:   Non-neoplastic and neoplastic PCa cells were treated with 10 nM DHT, and the expression of fatty acids transporter, fatty acid synthase (FASN), and carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) evaluated. PCa cells were also exposed to LDL (100 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of DHT.  Results:   Treatment with DHT upregulated the expression of FASN and CPT1A in androgen-sensitive PCa cells. In contrast, LDL supplementation suppressed FASN expression regardless of the presence of DHT, whereas augmenting CPT1A levels. Our results also showed that LDL-cholesterol increased PCa cells viability, proliferation, and migration dependently on the presence of DHT. Moreover, LDL and DHT synergistically enhanced the accumulation of lipid droplets in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   The obtained results show that androgens deregulate lipid metabolism and enhance the effects of LDL increasing PCa cells viability, proliferation and migration. The present findings support clinical data linking obesity with PCa and first implicate androgens in this relationship.

The corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was predicted to be EUR 39,814 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. ADT+apalutamide and ADT+enzalutamide incurred higher costs and lower QALYs compared to ADT+abiraterone. For all ARATs, drug costs constituted the most substantial cost component. Results were stable except for a large univariable reduction in the pre-progression utility under ADT+abiraterone and very large variations in drug prices.  Conclusions:   Our model projected ADT+abiraterone to be cost-effective compared to ADT+docetaxel at a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 70,400/QALY (CHF 100,000 applying purchasing power parities). Given lower estimated QALYs for ADT+apalutamide and ADT+enzalutamide compared to ADT+abiraterone, the former only became cost-effective (the preferred) treatment option(s) at substantial 75-80% (80-90%) price reductions.""","""['Michaela C Barbier', 'Yuki Tomonaga', 'Dominik Menges', 'Henock G Yebyo', 'Sarah R Haile', 'Milo A Puhan', 'Matthias Schwenkglenks']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Cost-Effectiveness of Systemic Treatments for Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: An Economic Evaluation Based on Network Meta-Analysis.', 'A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: Systematic Review, Network Meta-analysis, and Benefit-harm assessment.', 'Triplet or Doublet Therapy in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.', 'A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   A total of 47,240 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study were followed from 1986 to 2016. Men reported their zinc supplement use at baseline and biennially thereafter. Clinical features of prostate cancer included stage, grade, lethal and aggressive (T4 or N1 or M1 or Gleason 8-10) outcome. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the association between zinc supplement use and incidence of prostate cancer.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 28.3 years, we documented 6,980 incident prostate cancer cases including 1,053 lethal and 1,143 aggressive. Zinc supplement use was not associated with overall, localized, low- and intermediate-grade prostate cancer. However, compared to never-users, men who used supplement zinc more than 75 mg/day were at higher risk for lethal (HR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.16-2.66, Ptrend = 0.001) and aggressive prostate cancer (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.19-2.73, Ptrend = 0.006). Similarly, men who took supplemental zinc for 15 or more years had a higher risk for lethal (HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.28-2.85, Ptrend <0.001) and aggressive prostate cancer (HR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03-2.33, Ptrend = 0.004).

This study aimed to compare the differential expression profiles of miRNAs in prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia patients.  Methods:   Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tissue samples were collected from prostate cancer (PCa) (n: 20) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (n: 20) patients. Total RNA isolation was performed. As a result of the RNA concentration and purity measurement, each patient group was pooled, and the miRNAs profiles comparison was performed with the Affymetrix Microarray System.  Results:   In tissue samples, 37 different expressed miRNAs were identified in PCa patients compared to BPH patients. In PBMCs samples, 27 different expressed miRNAs were identified in PCa patients compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia patients. As a result of the comparison of tissue and PBMCs samples, it was determined that down regülated hsa-miR-494-3p, hsa-miR-3128, hsa-miR-8084 were common miRNAs. 3 (HIF1A, NHS,INSL4) targets identified for hsa-miR-494-3p, 2 (HIF1A, AVRP1A) for hsa-miR-3128, 3 (AVRP1A, NHS, INSL4) for hsa-miR-8084.

Methods:   The participants in this cross-sectional study were divided into PCa group (101 patients who matched the including criteria, average age 71) and control group (52 individuals, with no evidence of malignancy, without oncological and other chronic diseases, and without prostate gland pathology, average age 40). The criteria to be included in the PCa group were as follows: i) being diagnosed with prostate cancer, based on digital rectal examination (DRE), prostate ultrasound investigation, or biopsy; ii) not being subjected to a surgical or any other treatment; iii) not having any other concomitant oncological diseases, renal failure, diabetes mellitus. The urinary concentration of the selected metabolites was established through high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS).  Results:   The comparison of both groups established a significantly different elevated concentration of ethanolamine, sarcosine and kynurenine, and a significantly different decreased concentration of β-alanine and isoleucine in PCa group.

The objective of our study was to examine the risk of BPH by antidiabetic drug use and glycemic control in a large population-based cohort of Finnish men.  Methods:   A total of 74,754 men in the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC) free of BPH at baseline in 1996-1999 were linked to the national medication reimbursement database for information on physician-prescribed antidiabetic drug purchases. Information on recorded BPH procedures and diagnoses was obtained from the National Care Register for Health Care, and for a subgroup of 17,739 men, information on blood glucose levels (BGLs) from the Fimlab Laboratories database. Cox regression with antidiabetic drug use and BGL as time-dependent variables was used to analyze the risks for starting BPH medication, recorded BPH diagnosis, and undergoing BPH surgery. The analysis was adjusted for age, use of statins, antihypertensive medication, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.  Results:   Of the subjects, 14,012 men (18.7%) used antidiabetic medication. Of the subgroup with fasting blood glucose data available, 7487 (42.2%) had diabetic level. The risks for BPH diagnosis (HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03-1.13) and surgery (HR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.09-1.24) were slightly elevated among antidiabetic drug users compared to nonusers. The association was strongest for insulin use. Similarly, risk of BPH surgery was increased in men with diabetic blood glucose compared to normoglycemic men. The risk association was attenuated by use of antidiabetic drugs.  Conclusions:   Diabetic BGL and antidiabetic medication use, especially insulin, are associated with an elevated risk of BPH surgery compared to nondiabetic men.

We investigated the findings on pre-treatment MRI and its potential influence on treatment decisions, and its ability to predict biochemical recurrence in patients treated with radiotherapy.  Methods:   Files of patients treated by radiotherapy from 2014 to 2022 were searched for if they had had an MRI within 12 months before radiotherapy. Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS) score, index lesion diameter and the presence of organ confined disease or extra-prostatic extension were correlated with their Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score. Distribution of radiological and clinical features between groups were estimated using a chi-squared test.  Results:   Out of 1280 patients, 314 (24.5%) had an MRI. The distribution depended on the treatment received: 22.5% who received low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy as monotherapy, 24.0% treated with high-dose rate (HDR) boost and 32.0% treated with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (P = .017). The CAPRA score significantly correlated with the PI-RADS score (r = .342, P < .01) and the diameter of the index lesion (r = .473, P < .01). A clinically significant number of 22% patients with CAPRA ≤ 3 disease presented with lesions ≥15 mm and were less likely to be treated with LDR monotherapy (P < .01). 39 patients had a recurrence, only 5 had an MRI: 4 had a lesion of ≥20 mm and 3 a seminal vesicle invasion.  Conclusion:   More than twenty percent of patients with CAPRA ≤3 presented on MRI a ≥15 mm lesion.

Thus, the study aimed to explore the metabolic (Meta) characteristics and develop a metabolism-based signature to predict the prognosis and immuno-/chemo-therapy response for PCa patients.  Methods:   Differentially expressed genes were screened among 2577 metabolism-associated genes. Univariate Cox analysis and random forest algorithms was used for features screening. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted to construct a prognostic Meta-model based on all combinations of metabolism-related features. Then the correlation between MetaScore and tumor was deeply explored from prognostic, genomic variant, functional and immunological perspectives, and chemo-/immuno-therapy response. Multiple algorithms were applied to estimate the immunotherapeutic responses of two MeteScore groups. Further in vitro functional experiments were performed using PCa cells to validate the association between the expression of hub gene SLC17A4 which is one of the model component genes and tumor progression. GDSC database was employed to determine the sensitivity of chemotherapy drugs.  Results:   Two metabolism-related clusters presented different features in overall survival (OS). A metabolic model was developed weighted by the estimated regression coefficients in the multivariate Cox regression analysis (0.5154*GAS2 + 0.395*SLC17A4 - 0.1211*NTM + 0.2939*GC). This Meta-scoring system highlights the relationship between the metabolic profiles and genomic alterations, gene pathways, functional annotation, and tumor microenvironment including stromal, immune cells, and immune checkpoint in PCa. Low MetaScore is correlated with increased mutation burden and microsatellite instability, indicating a superior response to immunotherapy. Several medications that might improve patients` prognosis in the MetaScore group were identified. Additionally, our cellular experiments suggested knock-down of SLC17A4 contributes to inhibiting invasion, colony formation, and proliferation in PCa cells in vitro.  Conclusions:   Our study supports the metabolism-based four-gene signature as a novel and robust model for predicting prognosis, and chemo-/immuno-therapy response in PCa patients.

Changes in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) in the patient groups stratified by prostate volume and the amount of testosterone reduction were assessed every 4 weeks until 12 weeks after androgen deprivation therapy initiation. Longitudinal mixed models were used to assess the adjusted effects of prostate volume and testosterone reduction on IPSS change. All mean values of IPSS-total score (IPSS-total), voiding subscore (IPSS-vs), and storage subscore (IPSS-ss) significantly decreased from baseline to week 12 in both patients with small (< 33 mL) and large (≥ 33 mL) prostates. The mean values of IPSS-total, IPSS-vs, and IPSS-ss similarly decreased in patients with large prostate with a baseline IPSS-total of ≥ 13. However, in those with small prostate, IPSS-ss specifically remained unchanged, while IPSS-total and IPSS-vs significantly decreased. In addition, only in patients with small prostate (< 33 mL), patients with lesser testosterone reduction (< Δ400 ng/dL) showed greater improvement in IPSS-ss by 7.5% compared with those with greater testosterone reduction (≥ Δ400 ng/dL).

We used bioinformatics methods to analyze the expression and prognostic significance of MeCP2, and the relationship between MeCP2 and clinicopathological parameters, genetic variation, methylation, phosphorylation, immune cell infiltration, and biological function in pan-cancer from using a public database. The results showed that expression of MeCP2 was up-regulated in 8 cancers and down-regulated in 2 cancers, which was remarkably correlated with the prognosis, pathological stage, grade and subtype of cancers. The promoter methylation level of MeCP2 DNA was decreased in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC), testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD);decreased phosphorylation of S25, S90, S92, S241, S286, S325 and S435 was found in MeCP2, such as UCEC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC).

Methods: The clinical and pathological data of 287 prostate cancer patients underwent RP from December 2019 to August 2021 in Department of Urology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center were collected and analyzed retrospectively. All patients were male, aging (66±7) years (range: 42 to 83 years). The preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (M(IQR)) were 16.00(29.64) μg/L (range: 0.01 to 99.90 μg/L). There were 244 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer and 43 patients with metastatic prostate cancer. All PAFP were dissected at RP routinely and were sent for pathologic analysis respectively. The PAFP was dissected from the prostate apex caudally toward the bladder neck and dissection extended to the joint of the prostate and the endopelvic fascia bilaterally. All the specimen of PAFP were examined and reported by subspecialty pathologists of genitourinary tumors. Statistical analysis was performed by Student t test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, χ2 test or Fisher exact test. Results: There were 8.0% (23/287) patients with lymph nodes in PAFP, 3.8% (11/287) patients with PAFP lymph node metastases. Pathologically upstaged occurred in 1 patient due to the PAFP lymph node as the solitary metastatic lesion.

PTDM was diagnosed with consensus criteria at 12 months after transplantation and 12 months before the diagnosis of cancer. The association between PTDM and cancer (overall and specific types) was evaluated with regression analysis.  Results:   During a follow-up of 12 years (interquartile range 8-14), 85 cases of 603 developed cancer (829/100 000/year) and 164 (27%) PTDM.

The experimental approach described here uses a well-studied adenovirus-poxvirus heterologous prime-boost regimen, in which the vectors encode a combination of prostate cancer antigens, with the booster dose delivered by either the intravenous or intramuscular (IM) route. This prime-boost regimen was investigated for antigen-specific CD8+ T cell induction.  Methods:   The coding sequences for four antigens expressed in prostate cancer, 5T4, PSA, PAP, and STEAP1, were inserted into replication-incompetent chimpanzee adenovirus Oxford 1 (ChAdOx1) and into replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA). In four strains of mice, ChAdOx1 prime was delivered intramuscularly, with an MVA boost delivered by either IM or intravenous routes. Immune responses were measured in splenocytes using ELISpot, multiparameter flow cytometry, and a targeted in vivo killing assay.  Results:   The prime-boost regimen was highly immunogenic, with intravenous administration of the boost resulting in a sixfold increase in the magnitude of antigen-specific T cells induced and increased in vivo killing relative to the intramuscular boosting route. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-specific responses were dominant in all mouse strains studied (C57BL/6, BALBc, CD-1 and HLA-A2 transgenic).  Conclusion:   This quadrivalent immunotherapeutic approach using four antigens expressed in prostate cancer induced high magnitude, functional CD8+ T cells in murine models.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective serial cross-sectional study using all primary AIS discharges (weighted n=5,748,358) with and without cancer in the 2007-2019 National Inpatient Sample. Admissions with primary central nervous system cancers were excluded. Joinpoint regression was used to compute the average annualized percentage change (AAPC) in cancer prevalence over time.  Results:   Across the study period, 12.7% of AIS admissions had previous/active cancer, while 4.4% had active cancer. Of these, 18.8% were hematologic cancers, 47.2% were solid cancers without metastasis and 34.0% were metastatic cancers of any type. Age-adjusted active cancer prevalence differed by sex (males:4.8%; females:4.0%) and increased with age up to age 70-79 years (30-39 years 1.4%; 70-79 years:5.7%). Amongst cancer admissions, lung (18.7%) and prostate (17.8%) were the most common solid cancers in men, while lung (19.6%) and breast (13.7%) were the most prevalent in women. Active cancer prevalence increased over time (AAPC 1.7%, p<0.05) but the pace of increase was significantly faster in women (AAPC 2.8%) compared to men (AAPC 1.1%) (p-comparison =0.003). Fastest pace of increased prevalence was seen for genitourinary cancers in women and for gastrointestinal cancers in both sexes. Genitourinary cancers in men declined over time (AAPC -2.5%, p<0.05). Lung cancer prevalence increased in women (AAPC 1.8%, p<0.05) but remained constant in men. Prevalence of head/neck, skin/bone, gastrointestinal, hematological and metastatic cancers increased over time at similar pace in both sexes.  Conclusion:   Prevalence of cancer in AIS admissions increased in the US over the last decade but the pace of this increase was faster in women compared to men. Gastrointestinal cancers in both sexes and genitourinary cancers in women are increasing at the fastest pace.

The STEAP1 is particularly over-expressed in prostate cancer, in contrast with non-tumoral tissues and vital organs, contributing to tumor progression and aggressiveness. However, the current understanding of STEAP1 lacks experimental data on the respective molecular mechanisms, structural determinants, and chemical modifications. This scenario highlights the relevance of exploring the biosynthesis of STEAP1 and its purification for further bio-interaction and structural characterization studies. In this work, recombinant hexahistidine-tagged human STEAP1 (rhSTEAP1-His6) was expressed in Komagataella pastoris (K. pastoris) mini-bioreactor methanol-induced cultures and successfully solubilized with Nonidet P-40 (NP-40) and n-Decyl-β-D-Maltopyranoside (DM) detergents. The fraction capacity of Phenyl-, Butyl-, and Octyl-Sepharose hydrophobic matrices were evaluated by manipulating the ionic strength of binding and elution steps. Alternatively, immobilized metal affinity chromatography packed with nickel or cobalt were also studied in the isolation of rhSTEAP1-His6 from lysate extracts. Overall, the Phenyl-Sepharose and Nickel-based resins provided the desired selectivity for rhSTEAP1-His6 capture from NP-40 and DM detergent-solubilized K. pastoris extracts, respectively. After a polishing step using the anion-exchanger Q-Sepharose, a highly pure, fully solubilized, and immunoreactive 35 kDa rhSTEAP1-His6 fraction was obtained. Altogether, the established reproducible strategy for the purification of rhSTEAP1-His6 paves the way to gather additional insights on structural, thermal, and environmental stability characterization significantly contributing for the elucidation of the functional role and oncogenic behavior of the STEAP1 in prostate cancer microenvironment.""","""['J Barroca-Ferreira', 'A M Gonçalves', 'Mfa Santos', 'T Santos-Silva', 'C J Maia', 'L A Passarinha']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Chromatogr A""","""['Specific Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 Capture with Gellan Gum Microspheres: Design, Optimization and Integration.', 'Enhanced Stability of Detergent-Free Human Native STEAP1 Protein from Neoplastic Prostate Cancer Cells upon an Innovative Isolation Procedure.', 'Impact of glycerol feeding profiles on STEAP1 biosynthesis by Komagataella pastoris using a methanol-inducible promoter.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting STEAP1 Protein in Human Cancer: Current Trends and Future Challenges.', 'Extraction, Modification and Biomedical Application of Agarose Hydrogels: A Review.', 'Specific Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 Capture with Gellan Gum Microspheres: Design, Optimization and Integration.']"""

Then we evaluated the impact of the bias of tPSA and fPSA on the estimation of the %f/tPSA ratio and performed a re-calibration of the proposed thresholds for the %f/tPSA ratio according to the assay used.  Methods:   tPSA and fPSA were measured in 135 and 137 serum samples, respectively by Abbott Alinity i, Beckman Access Dxl, Roche Cobas e801, and Siemens Atellica IM analytical platforms.

The linear equations with confidence intervals of the parameter estimates were used to transform the tPSA risk thresholds for advanced PCa into the corresponding concentrations measurable by the other analytical methods. To construct a correction coefficient for converting the %f/tPSA ratio from one method to the other, PB and non-parametric boostrapping were used.  Results:   The inter-method bias is not constant but strictly linear allowing the conversion of PSA results obtained from Roche into the other assays, which underestimate tPSA vs. Roche. Siemens and Abbott vs. Roche and Beckman assays, being characterized by a positive and a negative proportional bias for tPSA and fPSA measurements, tend to overestimate the %f/tPSA ratio.

Applying sparsely sampled data to non-interactive methods yields higher registration errors (6.26 mm), demonstrating the effectiveness of interactive MR-TRUS registration, which may be applied intraoperatively given the real-time nature of the adaptation process.""","""['Zachary M C Baum', 'Yipeng Hu', 'Dean C Barratt']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Med Imaging""","""['Assessment of image registration accuracy in three-dimensional transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy.', 'Learning Non-rigid Deformations for Robust, Constrained Point-based Registration in Image-Guided MR-TRUS Prostate Intervention.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'TRUS-MRI image registration: a paradigm shift in the diagnosis of significant prostate cancer.', 'Deep Learning and Vision Transformer for Medical Image Analysis.']"""

Patients and methods:   Men with progressive mCPRC following ≥1 line of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy and bone metastases but no documented BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 alterations or bulky visceral disease were included. Niraparib dose was escalated in combination with standard dosing of Radium-223 using a time-to-event continual reassessment method. The highest dose level with a DLT probability <20% was defined as MTD. Secondary endpoints included PSA change and progression-free survival. Exploratory analyses included assessing DNA mutations found in ctDNA as well as gene expression changes assessed in whole blood samples.  Results:   Thirty patients were treated with niraparib and radium-223: 13 patients received 100 mg, 12 received 200 mg, and 5 patients received 300 mg of niraparib. There were six DLT events: two (13%) for neutropenia, two (13%) for thrombocytopenia, whereas fatigue and nausea each occurred once (3%). Anemia (2/13%) and neutropenia (2/13%) were the most common grade 3 adverse events. For patients with prior chemotherapy exposure, the MTD was 100 mg, whereas the MTD for chemotherapy naïve patients was 200 mg. Whole blood gene expression of PAX5 and CD19 was higher in responders and ARG-1, IL2R, and FLT3 expression was higher in nonresponders.  Conclusions:   Combining niraparib with Radium-223 in patients with mCRPC was safe; however, further studies incorporating biomarkers will better elucidate the role of combinations of PARP inhibitors with DNA damaging and other agents.""","""['Zachary Quinn', 'Benjamin Leiby', 'Guru Sonpavde', 'Atish D Choudhury', 'Christopher Sweeney', 'David Einstein', 'Russell Szmulewitz', 'Oliver Sartor', 'Karen Knudsen', 'Eddy Shih-Hsin Yang', 'Wm Kevin Kelly']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Niraparib in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA repair gene defects (GALAHAD): a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Niraparib with androgen receptor-axis-targeted therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: safety and pharmacokinetic results from a phase 1b study (BEDIVERE).', 'A Phase I Study of Combination Olaparib and Radium-223 in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) with Bone Metastases (COMRADE).', 'Treatment of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Are PARP Inhibitors Shifting the Paradigm?', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.', 'PARP inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Eight Italian specialized centers evaluated the incidence of malignant neoplasms in hemoglobinopathies as well as their sites and features. The study cohort included 4631 patients followed between 1970 and 2021 (transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia, 55.6%; non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia, 17.7%; sickle cell disease, 17.6%; hemoglobin H disease, 8.3%).  Results:   A total of 197 diagnoses of cancer were reported (incidence rate, 442 cases per 100,000 person-years). The liver was the most frequent site of tumors in both sexes, with a higher incidence (190 cases per 100,000 person-years) in comparison with the general population found in all types of hemoglobinopathies (except hemoglobin H disease). In recent years, tumors have become the second cause of death in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia. A lower risk of breast and prostate cancer was observed in the whole group of patients with hemoglobinopathies. The first cancer diagnoses dated back to the 1980s, and the incidence rate sharply increased after the 2000s. However, although the incidence rate of cancers of all sites but the liver continued to show an increasing trend, the incidence of HCC showed stability.  Conclusions:   These findings provide novel insights into the relationship between cancer and hemoglobinopathies and suggest that the overall risk is not increased in these patients. HCC has been confirmed as the most frequent tumor, but advances in chelation and the drugs that have led to the eradication of hepatitis C may explain the recent steadiness in the number of diagnoses that is reported here.""","""['Raffaella Origa', 'Barbara Gianesin', 'Filomena Longo', 'Rosario Di Maggio', 'Elena Cassinerio', 'Maria Rita Gamberini', 'Valeria Maria Pinto', 'Antonella Quarta', 'Maddalena Casale', 'Giorgio La Nasa', 'Giovanni Caocci', 'Antonio Piroddi', 'Andrea Piolatto', 'Alessandra Di Mauro', 'Claudia Romano', 'Antonia Gigante', 'Susanna Barella', 'Aurelio Maggio', 'Giovanna Graziadei', 'Silverio Perrotta', 'Gian Luca Forni']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Hepatocellular carcinoma in thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies.', 'Reply to ""Hepatocellular carcinoma in thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies"".', 'Hemoglobinopathies: clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment.', 'Distribution of thalassemias and associated hemoglobinopathies identified by prenatal diagnosis in Taiwan.', ""Molecular prevalence of thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies among the Lao Loum Group in the Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '""Minor"" hemoglobinopathies: a risk factor for asthma.', 'Thalassemia and related hemoglobinopathies.', 'Hepatitis C and Thalassemia: A Story with (Almost) a Happy Ending.']"""

In CP/CPPS, urine exosomes exhibited significant upregulation of eight PCa-specific microRNAs (e.g., hsa-miR-501, hsa-miR-20a, and hsa-miR-106), whose target genes were significantly enriched for GO terms, hallmark gene sets, and pathways specific for carcinogenesis. In THP-1 monocytes, CP/CPPS-derived urine exosomes induced upregulation of PCa-associated proinflammatory genes (e.g., CCR2 and TLR2) and proto-oncogene transcription factors (e.g., MYB and JUNB). In contrast, CP/CPPS-derived blood exosomes exhibited molecular properties similar to those of healthy men.

Methods After preprocessing of the data from Population Health Data Archive, smuothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) was used to select features. Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), back propagation neural network (BP), and convolutional neural network (CNN) were used to predict the risk of PCa, among which BP and CNN were used on the enhanced data by SMOTE. The performances of models were compared using area under the curve (AUC) of the receiving operating characteristic curve. After the optimal model was selected, we used the Shiny to develop an online calculator for PCa risk prediction based on predictive indicators. Results Inorganic phosphorus, triglycerides, and calcium were closely related to PCa in addition to the volume of fragmented tissue and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Among the four models, RF had the best performance in predicting PCa (accuracy: 96.80%; AUC: 0.975, 95% CI: 0.964-0.986). Followed by BP (accuracy: 85.36%; AUC: 0.892, 95% CI: 0.849-0.934) and SVM (accuracy: 82.67%; AUC: 0.824, 95% CI: 0.805-0.844).

Methods:   Male participants in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (Australia) were recruited between 2006 and 2009. Questionnaire data and linked administrative health data from the Centre for Health Record Linkage and Services Australia identified melanomas diagnosed between 1/1/1994 and 12 months before Study recruitment (i.e., between 2005 and 2008), incident PCs, primary healthcare utilisation and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests. Men were excluded from the current analyses if they had a recorded PC or other cancer diagnosis other than melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer prior to recruitment. Multivariable Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) adjusting for PSA-testing frequency before PC diagnosis.  Results:   Of 96,548 eligible men, 1899 were diagnosed with melanoma during the melanoma diagnosis period and 3677 incident PC diagnosed during follow-up (latest date 31/12/2013). Men with melanoma diagnosis had increased risk of a subsequent PC diagnoses (vs. no melanoma; fully adjusted HR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.09-1.60). There was weak evidence of higher risks of a subsequent PC diagnosis for men diagnosed with more than one melanoma compared to men diagnosed with only one melanoma (p = 0.077), and if first melanoma diagnosis was 10 to 15 years before Study recruitment (fully adjusted HR = 2.05; 95% CI [1.35, 3.12]).

Our objective was to conduct a retrospective cohort population-based study to evaluate the association between 5ARI use, BC diagnosis, and BC mortality.  Patients and methods:   We used routinely collected health care data from Ontario, Canada. Men ≥66 years of age with a prescription for a 5ARI were matched to non-5ARI users. Matching was done using a propensity score of selected covariates to make 96 different covariates comparable. We measured 5 additional baseline variables which may have impacted the risk of future BC diagnosis: prior cystoscopy, urine cytology, urinalysis, gross hematuria episodes, and transurethral resection of a bladder lesion. Only the first period of continuous usage of 5ARIs was considered. The prespecified at-risk period for outcomes started 1 year after initiating therapy and ended at the last date of 5ARI exposure + 1 year.  Results:   We identified 93,197 men who initiated 5ARI therapy (52% dutasteride, and 48% finasteride) between 2003 and 2013 and matched them 1:1 to men who did not start a 5ARI. The median at-risk period for the 5ARI group was 1.68 years (interquartile range 1.00, 4.27). With adjustment for the variables related to prior BC investigations there was no significant difference in BC diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82-1.32) during the period of 0 to <2 years of 5ARI use; however, after ≥2 years of 5ARI use, the risk of BC diagnosis was significantly lower among the 5ARI group (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.79-0.94). In a similarly adjusted model, BC mortality was lower among 5ARI users, but no longer statistically significant (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65, 1.02). When stratified by type of 5ARI, finasteride significantly reduced the risk of BC diagnosis after ≥2 years of continuous use (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76, 0.96); however, dutasteride did not (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83, 1.03).

WPRT, compared to prostate only radiotherapy (PORT), is associated with increased acute gastrointestinal, and hematological toxicities. To further explore minimizing normal tissue toxicities associated with WPRT in definitive IMRT for prostate cancer, this planning study compared dosimetric differences between static 9-field-IMRT, full arc VMAT, and mixed partial-full arc VMAT techniques. In this retrospective study, 12 prostate cancer patients who met the criteria for WPRT were randomly selected for this study. The initial volume, PTV46, included the prostate, seminal vesicles, and pelvic nodes with margin and was prescribed to 4600 cGy. The cone-down volume, PTV78, included the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles with margin to a total dose of 7800 cGy. For each CT image set, 3 plans were generated for each of the PTVs: an IMRT plan, a full arc (FA) VMAT plan, and a mixed partial-full arc (PFA) VMAT plan, using 6MV photons energy. According to RTOG protocols none of the plans had a major Conformity Index (CI) violation by any of the 3 planning techniques. PFA plan had the best mean CI index of 1.00 and significantly better than IMRT (p = 0.03) and FA (p = 0.007). For equivalent PTV coverage, the average composite gradient index of the PFA plans was better than the IMRT and the FA plans with values 1.92, 2.03, and 2.01 respectively. The defference was statistically significant between PFA/IMRT and PFA/FA, with p- values of < 0.001. The IMRT plans and the PFA plans provided very similar doses to the rectum, bladder, sigmoid colon, and femoral heads, which were lower than the dose in the FA plans. There was a significant decrease in the mean dose to the rectum from 4524 cGy with the FA to 4182 cGy with the PFA and 4091 cGy with IMRT (p < 0.001). The percent of rectum receiving 4000 cGy was also the highest with FA at 66.1% compared to 49.9% (PFA) and 47.5% (IMRT). There was a significant decrease in the mean dose to the bladder from 3922 cGy (FA) to 3551 cGy (PFA) and 3612 cGy (IMRT) (p < 0.001). The percent of bladder receiving 4000 cGy was also the highest with FA at 45.4% compared to 36.6% (PFA) and 37.4% (IMRT). The average mean dose to the sigmoid colon decreased from 4177 cGy (FA) to 3893 cGy (PFA) and 3819 cGy (IMRT). The average mean dose to the femoral heads decreased from 2091 cGy (FA) to 2026 cGy (PFA) and 1987 cGy (IMRT).

Methods:   In this retrospective cohort study, we linked several provincial-level databases available at ICES, an independent, non-profit research institute. We included all males aged 20 years and older in the province of Ontario eligible for health care for each fiscal year (Apr. 1 to Mar. 31) in 2008-2016. We determined age-standardized prostate cancer incidence rates, stratifying by immigrant status (a binary variable) and region of origin. We used a log-binomial model to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios, with long-term residents (Canadian-born Ontarians as well as those who immigrated before 1985, when available data on immigration starts) as the reference group. We included age, neighbourhood income and time since landing in the models. Additional models limited to immigrant males in the cohort included immigration admission category (economic class, family class, refugee, other) and time since landing in Canada.  Results:   There were 74594 incident cases of prostate cancer in the study period, 6742 of which were among immigrant males. Males who had immigrated from West Africa and the Caribbean had significantly higher incidence of prostate cancer than other immigrants and long-term residents: adjusted rate ratios of 2.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.41-3.05) and 1.91 (95% CI 1.78-2.04), respectively. Immigrants from other regions, including East Africa and Middle-Southern Africa, had lower or similar incidence rates to long-term residents. Males from South Asia had the lowest adjusted rate ratio (0.47, 95% CI 0.45-0.50).  Interpretation:   The age-standardized incidence rate of prostate cancer from 2008 to 2016 was consistently and significantly higher among immigrants from West African and Caribbean countries than among other immigrants and long-term residents of the province. Future research in Canada should focus on further understanding heterogeneity in prostate cancer risk and epidemiology, including stage of diagnosis and mortality, for immigrants.""","""['Aisha K Lofters', 'Jacqueline L Bender', 'Sarah Swayze', 'Shabbir Alibhai', 'Anthony Henry', 'Kenneth Noel', 'Geetanjali D Datta']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""CMAJ Open""","""['Incidence of breast and colorectal cancer among immigrants in Ontario, Canada: a retrospective cohort study from 2004-2014.', 'Generational Patterns of Asthma Incidence among Immigrants to Canada over Two Decades.

Heat shock protein B8 (HSPB8) is an important factor in the progression of various types of cancer. However, the clinical significance and biological role of HSPB8 in PC are still unclear. In this study, we determined HSPB8 expression in PC tissues by immunohistochemical staining and explored the in vitro functions of HSPB8 using HSPB8 knockdown DU145 and LNcap PC cell lines. The in vivo effect of HSPB8 was explored by a subcutaneous xenograft mice model. The human phospho-kinase array and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 activator were utilized to explore the potential mechanism of HSPB8-induced PC progression. As a result, we found that HSPB8 was abundantly expressed in PC tissues and cell lines. HSPB8 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and migration, promoted apoptosis and cycle repression, as well as weakened tumorigenesis ability. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that HSPB8 facilitates the malignant phenotypes of PC by activating the Janus kinase/STAT3 signaling pathway.

The performance of nanocarriers via specific targeting has the potential to improve imaging contrast and therapeutic efficacy in vivo with increased deep tissue penetration. To address this hypothesis, we designed and synthesized prostate cancer-targeting starPEG nanocarriers (40 kDa, 15 nm), [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)3(ACUPA)1 and [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)1(ACUPA)3, with one or three prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting ACUPA ligands. The in vitro PSMA binding affinity and in vivo pharmacokinetics of the targeted nanocarriers were compared with a nontargeted starPEG, [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)4, in PSMA+ PC3-Pip and PSMA- PC3-Flu cells, and xenografts. Increasing the number of ACUPA ligands improved the in vitro binding affinity of PEG-derived polymers to PC3-Pip cells. While both PSMA-targeted nanocarriers significantly improved tissue penetration in PC3-Pip tumors, the multivalent [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)1(ACUPA)3 showed a remarkably higher PC3-Pip/blood ratio and background clearance. In contrast, the nontargeted [89Zr]PEG-(DFB)4 showed low EPR-mediated accumulation with poor tumor tissue penetration. Overall, ACUPA conjugated targeted starPEGs significantly improve tumor retention with deep tumor tissue penetration in low EPR PC3-Pip xenografts. These data suggest that PSMA targeting with multivalent ACUPA ligands may be a generally applicable strategy to increase nanocarrier delivery to prostate cancer. These targeted multivalent nanocarriers with high tumor binding and low healthy tissue retention could be employed in imaging and therapeutic applications.""","""['Niranjan Meher', 'Gary W Ashley', 'Anil P Bidkar', 'Suchi Dhrona', 'Cyril Fong', 'Shaun D Fontaine', 'Denis R Beckford Vera', 'David M Wilson', 'Youngho Seo', 'Daniel V Santi', 'Henry F VanBrocklin', 'Robert R Flavell']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Assessment of Carborane-Loaded Theranostic Nanoparticles to Target Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'Tumor Uptake of Triazine Dendrimers Decorated with Four, Sixteen, and Sixty-Four PSMA-Targeted Ligands: Passive versus Active Tumor Targeting.', 'PEG-PLA nanoparticles decorated with small-molecule PSMA ligand for targeted delivery of galbanic acid and docetaxel to prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-Targeted Nanotheranostics for Imaging and Radiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Up-Regulation of PSMA Expression In Vitro as Potential Application in Prostate Cancer Therapy.']"""

Methods:   A total of 216 patients from 2018 to 2020 with suspicion of PCa and negative mpMRI (PI-RADS ≤ 2) were interviewed by telephone about outcome and further follow-up. Clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was defined as ISUP ≥ 2. Patients with vs. without biopsy and with vs. without PCa were compared. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate predictors of PCa occurrence in patients with negative mpMRI.  Results:   15.7% and 5.1% of patients with PI-RADS ≤ 2 on mpMRI showed PCa and csPCa, respectively. PCa patients had higher PSAD (0.14 vs. 0.09 ng/ml2; p = 0.001) and lower prostate volume (50.5 vs. 74.0 ml; p = 0.003). Patients without biopsy (25%) after MRI were older (69 vs. 65.5 years; p = 0.027), showed lower PSA (5.7 vs. 6.73 ng/ml; p = 0.033) and lower PSA density (0.09 vs. 0.1 ng/ml2; p = 0.027).

Therefore, We hypothesize that PCa can be stratified into metabolic subgroups based on glycolytic and cholesterogenic related genes, and the different subgroups are closely related to the immune microenvironment. Bioinformatics analysis of genomic, transcriptomic, and clinical data from a comprehensive cohort of PCa patients was performed. Datasets included the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) dataset, GSE70768, our previously published PCa cohort. The unsupervised cluster analysis was employed to stratify PCa samples based on the expression of metabolic-related genes. Four molecular subtypes were identified, named Glycolytic, Cholesterogenic, Mixed, and Quiescent. Each metabolic subtype has specific features. Among the 4 subtypes, the cholesterogenic subtype exhibited better median survival, whereas patients with high expression of glycolytic genes showed the shortest survival. The mitochondrial pyruvate carriers (MPC) 1 exhibited expression difference between PCa metabolic subgroups, but not for MPCs 2. Glycolytic subtypes had lower immune cell scores, while Cholesterogenic subgroups had higher immune cell scores.

STEAP2 expression in peritumoral tissues, osteosarcoma, benign fibrous dysplasia, osteosarcoma cells, normal osteoblastic hFOB cells, and various invasive subclones was evaluated using IHC, ICC, and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated the association between STEAP2 expression and disease outcome using Kaplan-Meier analyses and then investigated STEAP2 regulation and its functional effects using both in vitro and in vivo assays. The results revealed that the upregulation of STEAP2 in osteosarcoma tissues positively correlated with both the malignant osteosarcoma phenotype and poor patient outcomes. In addition, STEAP2 expression induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis and facilitated osteosarcoma cell infiltration and migration. Changes in EFEMP2 expression resulted in correlating changes in STEAP2 expression, with EFEMP2-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells exhibiting a less invasive phenotype and reduced EMT following STEAP2 inhibition. It is also worth noting that although EFEMP2 overexpression activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway promoting EMT, it did not affect osteosarcoma cells in which STEAP2 or Akt was knocked down. Thus, we can conclude that STEAP2 acts as an oncogene in osteosarcoma progression, while EFEMP2 enables PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis initiation and EMT by partly targeting STEAP2, thereby facilitating osteosarcoma cell infiltration and migration.""","""['Dong Zhang', 'Haitao Liu', 'Weihua Wang', 'Gang Xu', 'Chenxiao Yin', 'Songgang Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['Fibulin-4 promotes osteosarcoma invasion and metastasis by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.', 'AIM2 inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration, and promotes the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by inactivating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'STEAP2 is down-regulated in breast cancer tissue and suppresses PI3K/AKT signaling and breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and in vivo.', 'ARHGAP9 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation, invasion and EMT via targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Highly-expressed P2X7 receptor promotes growth and metastasis of human HOS/MNNG osteosarcoma cells via PI3K/Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin and mTOR/HIF1α/VEGF signaling.', 'Functional role of MicroRNA/PI3K/AKT axis in osteosarcoma.']"""

Genome-wide transcriptome profiling revealed a widespread impact of the Sam68/XRN2 complex on APA. XRN2 promotes recruitment of Sam68 to its target transcripts, where it competes with the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor for binding to strong polyadenylation signals at distal ends of genes, thus promoting usage of suboptimal proximal polyadenylation signals.

However, there is limited data about factors that could impact older individuals' adherence to these guideline-based intervals. This study emphasized the differences in screening rates between men and women undergoing screening for breast (mammogram) and prostate (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] test) cancer. It also investigated the socio-demographic and emotional factors associated with screening time intervals.  Materials and methods:   This cross-sectional design study used data from the National Social Life Health and Aging Project Wave 3 (NSHAP-W3, 2015). The outcome measures were screening time intervals (PSA test or mammogram). Individuals were asked, ""About how long has it been since you last had a screening?"" Response categories ranged from 1 = within the past year to 5 = never. Differences in screening time intervals were evaluated and displayed by age group (PSA vs. mammogram). The association between the outcome measures and participants' characteristics was evaluated via ordinal logistic regression.  Results:   There were 2320 participants included: 52% women and 48% men. They had a mean age of 66.9 years old, were mostly White (74%) and college graduates (68%). The average time interval between screenings was greater for PSA testing than mammography (mean [M] = 2.28 vs. M = 1.89, p < 0.001). The middle age groups (PSA: 60-79 and mammogram: 65-74), had significantly more frequent screenings compared to the youngest group (50-54). In contrast, older (80+) individuals did not display shorter screening time intervals compared to the youngest group. Furthermore, shorter time intervals between screenings were associated with higher household income (mammogram: odds ratio [OR] = 0.804; PSA: OR = 0.785, p < 0.05), African American descent (mammogram: OR = 0.458, p < 0.001), and higher frequency of physical activity (PSA: OR = 0.921, p = 0.030).

High-quality evidence regarding the clinical efficacy remains limited.  Objective:   To assess medium-term oncological efficacy along with patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective single-center cohort study was performed from 2014 to 2020. Patients with primary International Society of Urological Pathologists (ISUP) grade group (GG) ≤2 by combined MRI/TRUS fusion and systematic prostate biopsy and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) <10 ng/ml were included.  Intervention:   MRI/TRUS fusion-guided focal HIFU therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was the cancer-free rate of the HIFU-treated lesion by biopsy after 1 yr. Secondary endpoints included salvage treatment-free survival (STFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), overall survival (OS), and PROMs according to International Consortium for Health Outcomes Measurement recommendations.  Results and limitations:   Fifty patients were included (median [range] age 68 [48-80] yr; median PSA 6.5 [1.2-9.9] ng/ml; GG 1 54% [n = 27], and GG 2 46% [n = 23]). The median (range) PSA decrease from baseline to 12 mo was 51% (35.9-72.7%). In total, 37/50 patients (74%) underwent a 1-yr biopsy. PCa was detected in 23 patients (46%; GG 1 20% [n = 10]; GG >1 26% [n = 13]; infield 40% [n = 20]). At a median follow-up of 42 (13-73) mo, PCa was detected in 30 men (60%). Among all patients, 19 (38%) underwent salvage treatments (median [95% confidence interval] STFS 53 [44.3-61.7] mo). MFS and OS were 100% and 98%, respectively. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 sexual domain decreased by 20.8 points (p = 0.372).  Conclusions:   MRI/TRUS-guided focal HIFU therapy results in complete cancer ablation in only half of the treated patients after 1 yr, with further recurrences at medium-term follow-up.

L-type amino acid transporters play a major role in the uptake of essential amino acids. L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) exerts its functional properties by forming a dimer with 4F2hc. Utilizing this cancer-specificity, research on diagnostic imaging and therapeutic agents for malignant tumors targeting LAT1 progresses in various fields. In hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, the up-regulation of L-type amino acid transporter 3 (LAT3) through the androgen receptor (AR) has been identified. On the other hand, in castration-resistant prostate cancer, the negative regulation of LAT1 through AR has been determined. Furthermore, 4F2hc: a binding partner of LAT1, was identified as the specific downstream target of Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7: AR-V7. LAT1 has been suggested to contribute to acquiring castration resistance in prostate cancer, making LAT1 a completely different therapeutic target from anti-androgens and taxanes. Increased expression of LAT1 has also been found in renal and bladder cancers, suggesting a contribution to acquiring malignancy and progression. In Japan, clinical trials of LAT1 inhibitors for solid tumors are in progress, and clinical applications are now underway.

However, the clinical significance of UGT2B28 tumoral expression and its contribution to PCa progression remain unclear. Using the Canadian Prostate Cancer Biomarker Network biobank (CPCBN; n = 1512), we analyzed UGT2B28 tumor expression in relation to clinical outcomes in men with localized PCa. UGT2B28 was overexpressed in tumors compared to paired normal adjacent prostatic tissue and was associated with inferior outcomes. Functional analyses indicated that UGT2B28 promoted cell proliferation, and its expression was regulated by the androgen receptor (AR)/ARv7. Mechanistically, UGT2B28 was shown to be a protein partner of the endocytic adaptor protein huntingtin-interacting protein 1 (HIP1), increasing its stability and priming AR/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways, leading to ERK1/2 activation triggering cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). HIP1 knockdown in UGT2B28 positive cells, and dual pharmacological targeting of AR and EGFR pathways, abolished cell proliferative advantages conferred by UGT2B28. In conclusion, UGT2B28 is a prognosticator of progression in localized PCa, regulates both AR and EGFR oncogenic signaling pathways via HIP1, and therefore can be therapeutically targeted by using combination of existing AR/EGFR inhibitors.""","""['Louis Lacombe', 'Hélène Hovington', 'Hervé Brisson', 'Sadia Mehdi', 'Déborah Beillevaire', 'Jean-Philippe Émond', 'Antoine Wagner', 'Lyne Villeneuve', 'David Simonyan', 'Véronique Ouellet', 'Véronique Barrès', 'Mathieu Latour', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Alain Bergeron', 'Vincent Castonguay', 'Félix Couture', 'Simone Chevalier', 'Fadi Brimo', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Martin Gleave', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Jean-Baptiste Lattouf', 'Dominique Trudel', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Anne-Marie Mes-Masson', 'Frédéric Pouliot', 'Yves Fradet', 'Etienne Audet-Walsh', 'Fred Saad', 'Chantal Guillemette', 'Eric Lévesque']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['DUSP22 suppresses prostate cancer proliferation by targeting the EGFR-AR axis.', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucuronosyl Transferase 2B28 (UGT2B28) Promotes Tumor Progression and Is Elevated in African American Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'The long non-coding RNA PCAL7 promotes prostate cancer by strengthening androgen receptor signaling.', 'Epidermal growth factor receptor expression escapes androgen regulation in prostate cancer: a potential molecular switch for tumour growth.', 'Prostate cancer: a model of integration of genomic and non-genomic effects of the androgen receptor in cell lines model.', 'A Non-Canonical Role for the Glycosyltransferase Enzyme UGT2B17 as a Novel Constituent of the B Cell Receptor Signalosome.']"""

We aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) PET-CT for the detection of osseous metastases in patients with high-risk prostate or breast cancer.  Methods:   MITNEC-A1 was a prospective, multicentre, single-cohort, phase 3 trial conducted in ten hospitals across Canada. Patients aged 18 years or older with breast or prostate cancer with a WHO performance status of 0-2 and with high risk or clinical suspicion for bone metastasis, but without previously documented bone involvement, were eligible. 18F-NaF PET-CT and 99mTc-MDP SPECT were done within 14 days of each other for each participant. Two independent reviewers interpreted each modality without knowledge of other imaging findings. The primary endpoint was the overall accuracy of 99mTc-MDP SPECT and 18F-NaF PET-CT scans for the detection of bone metastases in the per-protocol population. A combination of histopathological, clinical, and imaging follow-up for up to 24 months was used as the reference standard to assess the imaging results. Safety was assessed in all enrolled participants. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01930812, and is complete.  Findings:   Between July 11, 2014, and March 3, 2017, 290 patients were screened, 288 of whom were enrolled (64 participants with breast cancer and 224 with prostate cancer). 261 participants underwent both 18F-NaF PET-CT and 99mTc-MDP SPECT and completed the required follow-up for statistical analysis. Median follow-up was 735 days (IQR 727-750). Based on the reference methods used, 109 (42%) of 261 patients had bone metastases. In the patient-based analysis, 18F-NaF PET-CT was more accurate than 99mTc-MDP SPECT (84·3% [95% CI 79·9-88·7] vs 77·4% [72·3-82·5], difference 6·9% [95% CI 1·3-12·5]; p=0·016).

It is unclear if these changes were temporary or differed by age or race and ethnicity.  Objective:   To assess the association of 2008 and 2012 PSA guidelines with prostate cancer incidence by age and race and ethnicity in the US.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study evaluated prostate cancer incidence from 2005 to 2018 in the US using data from the US Cancer Statistics public use database. Data were analyzed from August 2020 through June 2022.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the year when rates of prostate cancer incidence changed directionality by age and race and ethnicity. Age-adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer and corresponding 95% CIs were created, followed by join point regression analysis to evaluate trends of age-adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer by age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and stage of diagnosis.  Results:   Among 2 944 387 men with prostate cancer, 2 869 943 (97.5%) men were aged 50 years and older. Men aged 50 years and older accounted for 185 476 of 191 533 Hispanic individuals (96.8%) and 2 684 467 of 2 752 854 non-Hispanic individuals (97.5%). Men aged 50 years and older accounted for 427 016 of 447 847 African American individuals (95.4%), 12 141 of 12 470 American Indian or Alaska Native individuals (97.4%), 61 126 of 62 159 Asian or Pacific Islander individuals (98.3%), and 2 294 171 of 2 344 392 White individuals (97.9%). Men with unknown race (77 519 men) were excluded from the analysis. A decrease in age-adjusted rate of prostate cancer after the 2008 guideline change was observed in all age groups by race and ethnicity. For example, among African American men ages 65 to 74 years, 10 784 of 807 080 men (1.34%) had a prostate cancer diagnosis in 2007 vs 10 714 of 835 548 men in 2008 (1.28%). The mean annual age-adjusted incidence rates of prostate cancer per 100 000 men were 157.7 men (95% CI, 157.4-158.0 men) in 2005 to 2008 and 131.9 men (95% CI, 131.6-132.2 men) in 2009 to 2012. The number of inflections and annual percent changes (APCs) for segments separated by inflections varied by age, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. For men ages 65 to 74 years, the APC was -6.53 (95% CI, -9.28 to -3.69) for 2009 to 2014 among African American men (2 join points), -5.96 (95% CI, -6.84 to -5.07) for 2007 to 2018 among American Indian or Alaska Native men (1 join point), -6.52 (95% CI, -9.22 to -3.74) for 2007 to 2014 among Asian or Pacific Islander men (2 join points), -7.92 (95% CI, -11.36 to -4.35) for 2009 to 2014 among Hispanic men (2 join points), and -7.02 (95% CI, -9.41 to -4.57) for 2007 to 2014 among White men (2 join points).‬‬‬‬‬‬‬‬.

Methods:   From a prospectively-maintained database, we included 370 individuals with ISUP 4 on final pathology. The main outcomes were to evaluate the relationship between different ISUP patterns within the group 4 with pathological and oncological outcomes. Binary logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier estimator were used to evaluate the role of the different categories (3 + 5, 4 + 4, 5 + 3) and tumor architecture (intraductal and/or cribriform) on pathological and oncological outcomes.  Results:   Among the 370 individuals with ISUP considered for the study, 9, 85 and 6% had grade 3 + 5, 4 + 4 and 5 + 3 PCa, respectively. Overall, 74% had extracapsular extension, while lymph node invasion (LNI) was documented in 9%. A total of 144 patients experienced BCR during follow-up. After adjusting for PSA, pT, grade group, LNI and positive surgical margins (PSM), grade 3 + 5 was a protective factor (HR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.13,0.68, p = 0.004) in predicting BCR relative to grade 4 + 4.

One emerging combination strategy is based on sensitizing ICB-refractory tumors with antagonists of 90kD heat shock protein (Hsp90) that target all four isoforms. However, pan-Hsp90 inhibitors are limited by the modest efficacy, on-target and off-tumor toxicities, and induction of the heat shock response (HSR) that overrides the effect of Hsp90 inhibition. Recently, we developed Hsp90β-selective inhibitors that were cytotoxic to cancer cells but did not induce HSR in vitro. Here, we report that the Hsp90β inhibitor NDNB1182 downregulated CDK4 (an Hsp90β-dependent client protein) and induced the expression of endogenous retroviral elements and interferon-stimulated genes. In syngeneic mouse models of prostate cancer and breast cancer, NDNB1182 significantly augmented the efficacy of ICB therapy. Furthermore, NDNB1182 showed superior tolerability to the pan-Hsp90 inhibitor Ganetespib in mice. Our findings provide evidence that Hsp90β inhibition is a potentially effective and safe regimen to combine with ICB to treat immunotherapy-refractory solid tumors.""","""['Sharif Rahmy', 'Sanket J Mishra', 'Sean Murphy', 'Brian S J Blagg', 'Xin Lu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Structure-Based Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Hsp90β-Selective Inhibitors.', 'Following the design path of isoform-selective Hsp90 inhibitors: Small differences, great opportunities.', 'Structure-guided design of an Hsp90β N-terminal isoform-selective inhibitor.', 'KU675, a Concomitant Heat-Shock Protein Inhibitor of Hsp90 and Hsc70 that Manifests Isoform Selectivity for Hsp90α in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Cytosolic Hsp90 Isoform-Specific Functions and Clinical Significance.']"""

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and its derivatives, as FDA-approved detection assays, are insufficient to serve as optimal markers for patient prognosis and clinical decision-making. It is widely acknowledged that aberrant glycolytic metabolism in PCa is related to tumor progression and acidifies the tumor microenvironment (TME). Considering the non-negligible impacts of glycolysis and immune functions on PCa, we developed a combined classifier in prostate cancer. The Glycolysis Score containing 19 genes and TME Score including three immune cells were created, using the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, log-rank test, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and the bootstrap approach. Combining the glycolysis and immunological landscape, the Glycolysis-TME Classifier was then constructed. It was observed that the classifier was more accurate in predicting the prognosis of patients than the current biomarkers. Notably, there were significant differences in metabolic activity, signaling pathways, mutational landscape, immunotherapeutic response, and drug sensitivity among the Glycolysishigh/TMElow, Mixed group and Glycolysislow/TMEhigh identified by this classifier. Overall, due to the significant prognostic value and potential therapeutic guidance of the Glycolysis-TME Classifier, we anticipate that this classifier will be clinically beneficial in the management of patients with PCa.""","""['Tao Guo', 'Jian Wang', 'Shi Yan', 'Xiangyu Meng', 'Xiaomin Zhang', 'Shuang Xu', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Yuhua Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['A Metabolism-Related Gene Landscape Predicts Prostate Cancer Recurrence and Treatment Response.', 'The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'A Comprehensive Prognostic and Immunological Analysis of a Six-Gene Signature Associated With Glycolysis and Immune Response in Uveal Melanoma.', 'Tumour microenvironment and focal therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Markers in Prostate Cancer Decision Making.', 'Immunoexpression profile of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) targets in potentially malignant and malignant oral lesions: a pilot study.']"""

There is a need to further understand the mechanisms behind endothelial cell aging in order to achieve vascular rejuvenation and minimize the onset of age-related vascular diseases. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proposed to regulate numerous processes in the human genome, yet their function in vascular aging and their therapeutic potential remain largely unknown. This is primarily because the majority of studies investigating the impact of aging on lncRNA expression heavily rely on in vitro studies based on replicative senescence. Here, using a unique collection of young and aged endothelial cells isolated from native human arteries, we sought to characterize the age-related alterations in lncRNA expression profiles. We were able to detect a total of 4463 lncRNAs expressed in the human endothelium from which ∼17% (798) were altered in advanced age. One of the most affected lncRNAs in aging was the primate-specific, Prostate Cancer Associated Transcript (PCAT) 14. In our follow up analysis, using single molecule RNA FISH, we showed that PCAT14 is relatively abundant, localized almost exclusively in the nucleus of young endothelial cells, and silenced in the aged endothelium. Functionally, our studies proposed that downregulation of PCAT14 alters endothelial cell transcription profile and cell functions including endothelial cell migration, sprouting and inflammatory responses in vitro. Taken together, our data highlight that endothelial cell aging correlates with altered expression of lncRNAs, which could impair the endothelial regenerative capacity and enhance inflammatory phenotypes.""","""['Maria-Kyriaki Drekolia', 'Sweta Talyan', 'Rebeca Cordellini Emídio', 'Reinier Abraham Boon', 'Stefan Guenther', 'Mario Looso', 'Gabrijela Dumbović', 'Sofia-Iris Bibli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Long non-coding RNA H19 regulates endothelial cell aging via inhibition of STAT3 signalling.', 'Altered long non-coding RNA transcriptomic profiles in brain microvascular endothelium after cerebral ischemia.', 'Biological Function of Long Non-coding RNA (LncRNA) Xist.', 'The Effect of Baicalin on the Expression Profiles of Long Non-Coding RNAs and mRNAs in Porcine Aortic Vascular Endothelial Cells Infected with Haemophilus parasuis.', 'Long non-coding RNAs: From disease code to drug role.', 'The Non-Coding RNA Journal Club: Highlights on Recent Papers-12.']"""

The preclinically physical and biological characteristics of the probe were analyzed. Polit clinical PET/CT translation was performed to analyze its feasibility in clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Methods:   [18F]AlF-PSMA-137 was maturely labeled with the [18F]AlF2+ labeling technique. It was analyzed by radio-HPLC for radiochemical purity and stability analysis in vitro and in vivo. The PSMA specificity was investigated in PSMA-positive (LNCaP) and PSMA-negative (PC3) cells, and the binding affinity was evaluated in LNCaP cells. Micro-PET/CT imaging was performed in mice bearing LNCaP or PC3 tumors. Thirteen patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer were included for [18F]AlF-PSMA-137 PET/CT imaging. Physiologic biodistribution and tumor burden were semi-quantitatively evaluated and the radiation dosimetry of [18F]AlF-PSMA-137 was estimated.  Results:   The radiochemical yield of [18F]AlF-PSMA-137 was 54.2 ± 10.7% (n = 16) with the radiochemical purity over 99% and the specific activity of 26.36 ± 7.33 GBq/μmol. The binding affinity to PSMA was 2.11 ± 0.63 nM. [18F]AlF-PSMA-137 showed high cell/tumor uptake which can be specifically blocked by PSMA inhibitor. According to the biodistribution in patients, [18F]AlF-PSMA-137 was mainly accumulated in kidneys, lacrimal glands, parotid glands, submandibular glands and liver which was similar to the extensive Glu-Ureas based probes. A total of 81 lesions were detected in PET/CT imaging and over 91% of lesions increased between 1 h p.i. (SUVmean: 10.98 ± 18.12) and 2 h p.i. (SUVmean: 14.25 ± 21.28) (p < 0.001). Additionally, the probe showed intensive accumulation in lesions which provided excellent imaging contrast with the high tumor-to-muscle ratio of 15.57 ± 27.21 at 1 h p.i. and 25.42 ± 36.60 at 2 h p.i.

Importantly, Brucella melitensis can induce reproductive disease in humans. Reproductive pathogenesis and evaluation of newly developed countermeasures against brucellosis studies have traditionally utilized female animal models. However, any potential, new intervention for use in humans would need to be evaluated in both sexes. Therefore, animal models for male reproductive brucellosis are desperately needed to understand disease progression. Accordingly, we evaluated guinea pigs and mice using B. melitensis 16 M in an intratracheal model of inoculation at different stages of infection (peracute, acute, and chronic) with an emphasis on determining the effect to the male reproductive organs. Aerosol inoculation resulted in colonization of the reproductive organs (testicle, epididymis, prostate) in both species. Infection peaked during the peracute (1-week post-infection [p.i.]) and acute (2-weeks p.i.) stages of infection in the mouse in spleen, epididymis, prostate, and testicle, but colonization was poorly associated with inflammation. In the guinea pig, peak infection was during the acute stage (4-weeks p.i.) and resulted in inflammation that disrupted spermatogenesis chronically. To determine if vaccine efficacy could be evaluated using these models, males were vaccinated using subcutaneous injection with vaccine candidate 16 MΔvjbR at 109 CFU/100 μl followed by intratracheal challenge with 16 M at 107. Interestingly, vaccination efficacy varied between species and reproductive organs demonstrating the value of evaluating vaccine candidates in multiple models and sexes. Vaccination resulted in a significant reduction in colonization in the mouse, but this could not be correlated with a decrease in inflammation. Due to the ability to evaluate for both colonization and inflammation, guinea pigs seemed the better model not only for assessing host-pathogen interactions but also for future vaccine development efforts.""","""['Martha E Hensel', 'Lauren W Stranahan', 'John F Edwards', 'Angela M Arenas-Gamboa']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Microbiol""","""['Intratracheal Inoculation with Brucella melitensis in the Pregnant Guinea Pig Is an Improved Model for Reproductive Pathogenesis and Vaccine Studies.', 'Characterization of an intratracheal aerosol challenge model of Brucella melitensis in guinea pigs.', 'Vaccine Candidate Brucella melitensis 16MΔvjbR Is Safe in a Pregnant Sheep Model and Confers Protection.', 'Novel vaccines against M. tuberculosis.', 'Molecular host-pathogen interaction in brucellosis: current understanding and future approaches to vaccine development for mice and humans.', 'Cell and Tissue Tropism of Brucella spp.']"""

We determined ALK expression by immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq, and genomic alterations by NGS. We assessed functional consequences of ALK overexpression and pharmacological ALK inhibition by cell proliferation and cell viability assays. Among 372 primary prostate cancer cases we identified one case with uniformly high ALK protein expression. Genomic analysis revealed a SLC45A3-ALK fusion which promoted oncogenesis in in vitro assays. We observed ALK protein expression in 5/52 (9%) of metastatic prostate cancer cases, of which 4 of 5 had neuroendocrine features. ALK-expressing neuroendocrine prostate cancer had a distinct transcriptional program, and earlier disease progression. An ALK-expressing neuroendocrine prostate cancer model was sensitive to pharmacological ALK inhibition. In summary, we found that ALK overexpression is rare in primary prostate cancer, but more frequent in metastatic prostate cancers with neuroendocrine differentiation.

Methods:   Advanced lung (n = 102) and prostate (n = 99) cancer patients completed a one-time survey. Using path analyses, we examined a parallel mediation model including the direct effects of perceived injustice on psycho-spiritual outcomes (i.e., anxiety, depressive symptoms, anger about cancer, anger towards God) and the indirect effects of perceived injustice on psycho-spiritual outcomes through two parallel mediators: meaning making and acceptance of cancer. We then explored whether these relations differed by cancer type.  Results:   Path analyses indicated that perceived injustice was directly and indirectly-through acceptance of cancer but not meaning making-associated with psycho-spiritual outcomes. Results did not differ between lung and prostate cancer patients.  Conclusions:   Advanced cancer patients with greater perceived injustice are at higher risk for poor psycho-spiritual outcomes.

It is a promising target for treating castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the development of AKR1C3 specific inhibitors remains challenging due to the high sequence similarity to its isoform AKR1C2. Here, we performed a combined in silico study to illuminate the inhibitory preference of 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids for AKR1C3 over AKR1C2, of which compound 38 can achieve up to 5000-fold anti-AKR1C3 selectivity. Our umbrella sampling (US) simulations together with end-point binding free energy calculation MM/GBSA uncover that the high inhibition selectivity originates from the different binding modes, namely ""Inward"" and ""Outward,"" of this compound series in AKR1C3 and AKR1C2, respectively. In AKR1C3/38, the tetrahydroquinoline moiety of 38 is accommodated inside the SP1 pocket and interacts favorably with surrounding residues, while, in AKR1C2/38, the SP1 pocket is too small to hold the bulky tetrahydroquinoline group that instead moves out of the pocket with 38 transitioning from an ""Inward"" to an ""Outward"" state. Further 3D-QSAR and energy decomposition analyses suggest that SP1 in AKR1C3 prefers to bind with a rigid bicyclic moiety and the modification of the R3 group has important implication for the compound's activity. This work is the first attempt to elucidate the selectivity mechanism of inhibitors toward AKR1C3 at the atomic level, which is anticipated to propel the development of next-generation AKR1C3 inhibitors with enhanced efficacy and reduced ""off-target"" effect for CRPC therapy.""","""['Xiaotian Kong', 'Enming Xing', 'Sijin Wu', 'Tony Zhuang', 'Pui-Kai Li', 'Chunhua Li', 'Xiaolin Cheng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Protein Sci""","""['3D-QSAR studies of 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-ylsulfonyl)benzoic acids as AKR1C3 inhibitors: Highlight the importance of molecular docking in conformation generation.', 'Development of potent and selective inhibitors of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) based on N-phenyl-aminobenzoates and their structure-activity relationships.', 'Hydroxytriazole derivatives as potent and selective aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) inhibitors discovered by bioisosteric scaffold hopping approach.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitors of type 5 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (AKR1C3): overview and structural insights.']"""

Methods:   Men enrolled from 2010 to 2019 in the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative registry a prospective clinical registry were studied. Urinary, bowel, and sexual functions were measured using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) at baseline and 12 months post-treatment. Higher scores on the EPIC-26 indicate better function. Multivariable regression models were applied to compare differences in function and extent of bother by treatment.  Results:   Of the 4926 eligible men, 57.0% underwent RP, 20.5% EBRT, 7.0% brachytherapy and 15.5% AS. While baseline urinary and bowel function varied little across treatment groups, sexual function differed greatly (adjusted mean scores: RP = 56.3, EBRT = 45.8, brachytherapy = 61.4, AS = 52.8; p < 0.001). Post-treatment urinary continence and sexual function declined in all treatment groups, with the greatest decline for sexual function after RP (adjusted mean score change - 28.9). After adjustment for baseline differences, post-treatment sexual function scores after EBRT (6.4; 95%CI, 0.9-12.0) and brachytherapy (17.4; 95%CI, 9.4-25.5) were higher than after RP. Likewise, urinary continence after EBRT (13.6; 95%CI, 9.0-18.2), brachytherapy (10.6; 95%CI, 3.9-17.3) and AS (10.6; 95%CI, 5.9-15.3) were higher than after RP. Conversely, EBRT was associated with lower bowel function (- 7.9; 95%CI, - 12.4 to - 3.5) than RP. EBRT and AS were associated with lower odds of sexual bother (OR 0.51; 95%CI, 0.29-0.89 and OR 0.60; 95%CI, 0.38-0.96, respectively), and EBRT with higher odds of bowel bother (OR 2.01; 95%CI, 1.23-3.29) compared with RP.  Conclusion:   The four common treatment approaches for prostate cancer were associated with different patterns of patient-reported functional outcomes, both pre- and 12 months post-treatment. However, after adjustment, RP was associated with a greater decline in urinary continence and sexual function than other treatments.

Through analysis of RNA-seq data, we nominate ARHGEF2 as a pivotal androgen-repressed gene. We show that ARHGEF2 is directly suppressed by androgen/AR. AR occupies the enhancer and communicates with the promoter region of ARHGEF2. Functionally, ARHGEF2 is important for the growth, lethal phenotype, and survival of CRPC cells and tumor xenografts. Correspondingly, AR inhibition or AR antagonist treatment can restore ARHGEF2 expression, thereby allowing prostate cancer cells to induce treatment resistance and tolerance. Overall, our findings provide an explanation for the contradictory clinical results that ADT resistance may be caused by the up-regulation of ARHGEF2 and provide a novel target.""","""['Xuanrong Chen#', 'Yi Shao#', 'Wanqing Wei#', 'Shimiao Zhu#', 'Yang Li', 'Yutong Chen', 'Hanling Li', 'Hao Tian', 'Guijiang Sun', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Zhiqun Shang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Downregulation of Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Accelerates Progression to Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Expansion of mouse castration-resistant intermediate prostate stem cells in vitro.']"""

Objective:   To study the relationship between risk reduction for PC mortality and age at first PSA screening.  Design, setting, and participants:   The randomized Göteborg-1 trial invited men for biennial PSA screening between the ages of 50 and 70 yr (screening, n = 10 000) or no invitation but exposure to opportunistic PSA testing (control, n = 10 000).  Intervention:   Regular versus opportunistic PSA screening or no PSA.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We modeled the nonlinear association between starting age and the absolute risk reduction in PC mortality in three settings: (1) intention-to-screen (randomized arms); (2) historical control (screening group and 1990-1994 registry data); and (3) attendees only (screening attendees and matched controls). We tested whether the effect of screening on PC mortality depends on the age at starting screening by comparing survival models with and without an interaction between trial arm and age (intention-to-screen and attendees only).  Results and limitations:   Younger age on starting PSA testing was associated with a greater reduction in PC mortality. Starting screening at age 55 yr approximately halved the risk of PC death compared to first PSA at age 60 yr. The test of association between starting age and the effect of screening on PC mortality was slightly greater than the conventional level of statistical significance (p = 0.052) for the entire cohort, and statistically significant among attendees (p = 0.002). This study is limited by the low number of disease-specific deaths for men starting screening before age 55 yr and the difficulty in discriminating between the effect of starting age and screening duration.  Conclusions:   Given that prior screening trials included men aged up to 70 yr on starting screening, our results suggest that the effect size reported in prior trials underestimates that of currently recommended programs starting at age 50-55 yr.  Patient summary:   In this study from the Göteborg-1 trial, we looked at the effect of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in reducing men's risk of dying from prostate cancer given the age at which they begin testing. Starting at a younger age reduced the risk of prostate cancer death by a greater amount.

Materials and methods:   We relied on a multi-institutional cohort of localized PCa patients who underwent RP in Martini-Klinik, Hamburg, or Prostate Center Northwest, Gronau, between 2014 and 2022. Analyses were restricted to PCa GGG 1-3 diagnosed at SBx (n = 4475) or TBx + SBx (n = 1282). Multivariable logistic regression modeling (MVA) predicting RP GGG upgrade of ≥ 1 was performed separately for SBx and TBx + SBx.  Results:   Treatment delay to RP of < 90, 90-180 and 180-365 days was reported in 59%, 35% and 6.2% of SBx and in 60%, 34% and 5.9% of the TBx + SBx patients, respectively. Upgrade to GGG ≥ 4 at RP was detected in 15% of SBx patients and 0.86% of TBx patients. In MVA performed for SBx, treatment delay yielded independent predictor status (OR 1.17 95% CI 1.02-1.39, p = 0.028), whereas for TBx + SBx MVA, statistical significance was not achieved.  Conclusion:   Treatment delay remained independently associated with radical prostatectomy GGG upgrade after adjustment for clinical variables in the patients diagnosed with SBx alone, but not in those who received combined TBx + SBx. These findings can be explained through inherent misclassification rates of SBx, potentially obfuscating historical observations of natural PCa progression and potential dangers of treatment delay. Thus, mpMRI-guided combined TBx + SBx appears mandatory for prospective delay-based examinations of PCa.""","""['Mykyta Kachanov#', 'Lars Budäus#', 'Jorn H Witt', 'Christian Wagner', 'Joerg Zinke', 'Bernhard Fangmeyer', 'Andreas Schütte', 'Tilmann Spieker', 'Dirk Beyersdorff', 'Markus Graefen', 'Pawel Rachubinski#', 'Sami-Ramzi Leyh-Bannurah#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Gleason Grade Group Concordance between Systematic Template Combining Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Targeted Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: A Comparison of Transperineal and Transrectal Approaches.', 'Targeted Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Quantitative Gleason 4 Grading Prediction in Radical Prostatectomy Specimens: Implications for Active Surveillance Candidate Selection.', 'Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Diagnostic Performance of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-directed Targeted plus Regional Biopsy Approach in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

We developed a model to predict hospitalisation for radiation-induced genitourinary toxicity based on patient characteristics.  Methods:   The prospective South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes registry was used to identify men with localised prostate cancer who underwent curative intent external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) between 1998 and 2019. Multivariable Cox proportional regression was performed. Model discrimination, calibration, internal validation and utility were assessed using C-statistics and area under ROC, calibration plots, bootstrapping, and decision curve analysis, respectively.  Results:   There were 3,243 patients treated with EBRT included, of which 644 (20%) patients had a treated-related admission. In multivariable analysis, diabetes (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.60, p < 0.001), smoking (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.40-2.12, p < 0.001), and bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) without transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) (HR 7.49, 95% CI 6.18-9.08 p < 0.001) followed by BOO with TURP (HR 4.96, 95% CI 4.10-5.99 p < 0.001) were strong independent predictors of hospitalisation (censor-adjusted c-statistic = 0.80). The model was well-calibrated (AUC = 0.76). The global proportional hazards were met. In internal validation through bootstrapping, the model was reasonably discriminate at five (AUC 0.75) years after radiotherapy.

In intermediate-risk disease, AA received more XRT (43.0 vs. 26.9%) and less RP (50.5 vs 66.8%), p = 0.016. In all men, RP resulted in worse urinary function and sexual HRQoL compared to AS and XRT. Bowel HRQoL did not vary by treatment in AA men, however, in non-AA men, XRT resulted in worse bowel scores than AS and RP. HRQoL was then compared for each treatment modality. AA men had worse sexual bother (p = 0.024) after RP than non-AA men, No racial differences were found in urinary, bowel, hormonal, or SF-36 scores for men undergoing AS, RP or XRT.

Pharmacological activation of REV-ERB nuclear receptors, the core components of the circadian clock, has antitumor effects on various malignancies, while the impact of SR9009 on prostate cancer (PCa) remains unknown. Here, we found that SR9009 was specifically lethal to PCa cell lines but had no cytotoxic effect on prostate cells. SR9009 significantly inhibited colony formation, the cell cycle, and cell migration and promoted apoptosis in PCa cells. SR9009 treatment markedly inhibited prostate cancer subtype 1 (PCS1), the most lethal and aggressive PCa subtype, through FOXM1 pathway blockade, while it had no impacts on PCS2 and PCS3. Seven representative genes, including FOXM1, CENPA, CENPF, CDK1, CCNB1, CCNB2, and BIRC5, were identified as the shared genes involved in the FOXM1 pathway and PCS1. All of these genes were upregulated in PCa tissues, associated with worse clinicopathological outcomes and downregulated after SR9009 treatment. Nevertheless, knockdown or knockout of REV-ERB could not rescue the anticancer effect of SR9009 in PCa. Further analysis confirmed that it was LXRα rather than REV-ERBs which has been activated by SR9009. The expression levels of these seven genes were changed correspondingly after LXRα knockdown and SR9009 treatment. An in vivo study validated that SR9009 restrained tumor growth in 22RV1 xenograft models and inhibited FOXM1 and its targeted gene expression. In summary, SR9009 can serve as an effective treatment option for highly aggressive and lethal PCS1 tumors through mediating the LXRα/FOXM1 pathway independently of REV-ERBs.""","""['Hang Xu#', 'Jiapeng Zhang#', 'Xiaonan Zheng#', 'Ping Tan', 'Xingyu Xiong', 'Xianyanling Yi', 'Yang Yang', 'Yan Wang', 'Dazhou Liao', 'Hong Li', 'Qiang Wei', 'Jianzhong Ai', 'Lu Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['The Putatively Specific Synthetic REV-ERB Agonist SR9009 Inhibits IgE- and IL-33-Mediated Mast Cell Activation Independently of the Circadian Clock.', 'SR9009 induces a REV-ERB dependent anti-small-cell lung cancer effect through inhibition of autophagy.', 'Pharmacological activation of REV-ERBs is lethal in cancer and oncogene-induced senescence.', 'Stimulation of nuclear receptor REV-ERBs suppresses production of pronociceptive molecules in cultured spinal astrocytes and ameliorates mechanical hypersensitivity of inflammatory and neuropathic pain of mice.', 'A role for rev-erbα ligands in regulation of adipogenesis.', 'The Role of REV-ERB Receptors in Cancer Pathogenesis.', 'FOXM1: A small fox that makes more tracks for cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Identification of a novel senescence-associated signature to predict biochemical recurrence and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.']"""

Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) with 68Ga-PSMA-11 is promising, although limited by low residual activity and artificial signals. Here, we aimed to assess the value of CLI and flexible autoradiography (FAR) with 18F-PSMA-1007. Methods: Mice bearing subcutaneous PSMA-avid RM1-PGLS tumors were administered 18F-PSMA-1007, and PET/CT was performed. After the animals had been killed, organs were excised and measured signals in CLI and FAR CLI were correlated with tracer activity concentrations (ACs) obtained from PET/CT. For clinical assessment, 7 high-risk PC patients underwent radical prostatectomy immediately after preoperative 18F-PSMA PET/CT. Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were calculated for both imaging modalities in intact specimens and after incision above the index lesion. Results: In the heterotopic in vivo mouse model (n = 5), CLI did not detect any lesion. FAR CLI detected a distinct signal in all mice, with a lowest AC of 7.25 kBq/mL (CNR, 5.48). After incision above the index lesion of the prostate specimen, no increased signal was observed at the cancer area in CLI. In contrast, using FAR CLI, a signal was detectable in 6 of 7 patients. The AC in the missed index lesion was 1.85 kBq/mL, resulting in a detection limit of at least 2.06 kBq/mL. Histopathology demonstrated 2 PRMs, neither of which was predicted by CLI or FAR CLI. Conclusion: 18F-PSMA FAR CLI was superior to CLI in tracer-related signal detectability. PC was could be visualized in radical prostatectomy down to 2.06 kBq/mL. However, the detection of PRMs was limited. Direct anatomic correlation of FAR CLI is challenging because of the scintillator overlay.""","""['Pedro Fragoso Costa', 'Lukas Püllen', 'Claudia Kesch', 'Ulrich Krafft', 'Stephan Tschirdewahn', 'Alexandros Moraitis', 'Jan Philipp Radtke', 'Saskia Ting', 'Michael Nader', 'Jasmin Wosniack', 'David Kersting', 'Katharina Lückerath', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Wolfgang Peter Fendler', 'Boris Alexander Hadaschik', 'Christopher Darr']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Intraoperative 68Ga-PSMA Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging for Surgical Margins in Radical Prostatectomy: A Feasibility Study.', 'Radiation Protection and Occupational Exposure on 68Ga-PSMA-11-Based Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging Procedures in Robot-Assisted Prostatectomy.', '68Ga-PSMA Cerenkov luminescence imaging in primary prostate cancer: first-in-man series.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Use and Impact of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Prior to Salvage Radiation Therapy in Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Scoping Review.']"""

However, there is a dearth of evidence for countries to implement affordable strategies. The WHO and various Commissions have recommended developing stakeholder-based needs assessments based on objective data to generate evidence to inform national and regional prioritisation of cancer research needs and goals.  Methodology:   Bibliometric algorithms (macros) were developed and validated to assess cancer research outputs of all 54 African countries over a 12-year period (2009-2020). Subanalysis included collaboration patterns, site and domain-specific focus of research and understanding authorship dynamics by both position and sex. Detailed subanalysis was performed to understand multiple impact metrics and context relative outputs in comparison with the disease burden as well as the application of a funding thesaurus to determine funding resources.  Results:   African countries in total published 23 679 cancer research papers over the 12-year period (2009-2020) with the fractional African contribution totalling 16 201 papers and the remaining 7478 from authors from out with the continent. The total number of papers increased rapidly with time, with an annual growth rate of 15%. The 49 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries together published just 5281 papers, of which South Africa's contribution was 2206 (42% of the SSA total, 14% of all Africa) and Nigeria's contribution was 997 (19% of the SSA total, 4% of all Africa). Cancer research accounted for 7.9% of all African biomedical research outputs (African research in infectious diseases was 5.1 times than that of cancer research). Research outputs that are proportionally low relative to their burden across Africa are paediatric, cervical, oesophageal and prostate cancer. African research mirrored that of Western countries in terms of its focus on discovery science and pharmaceutical research. The percentages of female researchers in Africa were comparable with those elsewhere, but only in North African and some Anglophone countries.  Conclusions:   There is an imbalance in relevant local research generation on the continent and cancer control efforts. The recommendations articulated in our five-point plan arising from these data are broadly focused on structural changes, for example, overt inclusion of research into national cancer control planning and financial, for example, for countries to spend 10% of a notional 1% gross domestic expenditure on research and development on cancer.""","""['Miriam Mutebi', 'Grant Lewison', 'Ajay Aggarwal', 'Olusegun Isaac Alatise', 'Christopher Booth', 'Miska Cira', 'Surbhi Grover', 'Ophira Ginsburg', 'Julie Gralow', 'Serine Gueye', 'Benda Kithaka', 'T Peter Kingham', 'Lofti Kochbati', 'Jennifer Moodley', 'Sulma Ibrahim Mohammed', 'Alex Mutombo', 'Ntokozo Ndlovu', 'Christian Ntizimira', 'Groesbeck Preer Parham', 'Fiona Walter', 'Jeannette Parkes', 'Delva Shamely', 'Nazik Hammad', 'Janet Seeley', 'Julie Torode', 'Richard Sullivan', 'Verna Vanderpuye']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMJ Glob Health""","""['Bibliometric analysis of cancer research outputs in Botswana between 2009 and 2021.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'The Profile of Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) research in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region: Analyzing the NCD burden, research outputs and international research collaboration.', 'Bibliometric analysis of sub-Saharan African and US authorship in publications about sub-Saharan Africa funded by the Fogarty International Center, 2008-2020.', 'Bibliometric trends of health economic evaluation in Sub-Saharan Africa.', 'An analysis of the African cancer research ecosystem: tackling disparities.', 'Bibliometric analysis of cancer research outputs in Botswana between 2009 and 2021.']"""

This study aimed to compare the clinical and CT imaging characteristics of PCa by focusing on BMs among patients with Gleason score (GS) ≥ 8 (high-risk group) and those with GS ≤ 7 (intermediate-low-risk group).  Methods:   Between 2014 and 2021, patients with pathologically proven PCa and no history of other malignancies were included. Clinical findings including age and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were collected. CT imaging findings, including the types of BM and other metastases, were evaluated by two radiologists. The clinical and CT imaging findings were compared between the high- and intermediate-low-risk groups.  Results:   Patients were classified into high-risk (n = 527) and intermediate-low-risk (n = 973) groups. Age at diagnosis (median: 71 [44-91] vs 69 [35-86] years, p < 0.0001), PSA (8.7 [0.01-15314.5] vs 5.8 [0.01-163.2] ng/mL, p < 0.0001), frequencies of BMs (osteoblastic: 47/527 [8.7%] vs 3/973 [0.3%]), osteolytic or mixed BM (19/527 [3.6%] vs 2/973 [0.2%]), lymph node metastases (76/527 [14.4%] vs 3/973 [0.3%]), and lung metastases (13/527 [2.5%] vs 0%) were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the intermediate-low-risk group (all p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Age, PSA, and the frequencies of osteolytic or mixed BMs were significantly higher in the high-risk group than in the intermediate-low-risk group. This study highlights the importance of high-risk PCa in the differential diagnoses of osteolytic or mixed BMs.""","""['Ryo Kurokawa', 'Shimpei Kato', 'Hiroaki Koyama', 'Masanori Ishida', 'Mariko Kurokawa', 'Ryohei Kuroda', 'Tetsuo Ushiku', 'Haruki Kume', 'Osamu Abe']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prevention of bone metastases in patients with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid: efficacy and safety results of the Zometa European Study (ZEUS).', '68GaPSMA-HBED-CC Uptake in Osteolytic, Osteoblastic, and Bone Marrow Metastases of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Associations of Prostate-Specific Antigen, Prostate Carcinoma Tissue Gleason Score, and Androgen Receptor Expression with Bone Metastasis in Patients with Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Establishing the pathways and indications for performing isotope bone scans in newly diagnosed intermediate-risk localised prostate cancer - results from a large contemporaneous cohort.', 'MR imaging features to predict the type of bone metastasis in prostate cancer.']"""

It remains unclarified if patients regain the function of the pituitary-testis axis after cessation of ADT. Thus, we aimed to investigate the function of the pituitary-testis axis following adjuvant ADT. In this study, we included men who underwent external beam radiation therapy and ADT for high-risk prostate cancer. All patients underwent assessment of testosterone deficiency (TD) symptoms, full biochemical assessment of the pituitary-testis axis, and dynamic stimulatory tests of gonadotropin (gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) test) and testosterone production (human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) test). Patients were diagnosed with TD based on a combination of TD symptoms and testosterone below age-specific reference ranges. TD was characterized as primary, secondary, or mixed based on serum gonadotropins and stimulatory tests. We found that among the 51 patients included in the study, the median time on ADT was 3.2 years and median time since ADT cessation was 3.8 years. Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed with TD; 10 had primary TD (testicular dysfunction), 11 secondary TD (pituitary dysfunction), and 7 mixed TD (combined pituitary and testicular dysfunction). An inadequate testosterone response to hCG stimulation was shown in 42 patients, whereas only 11 patients had a subnormal gonadotropin response to GnRH. We conclude that persistent TD is a common long-term consequence of adjuvant ADT in prostate cancer survivors, equally distributed between pituitary and testicular dysfunction. The study emphasizes the necessity for systematic follow-up of full pituitary-testis axis function in patients receiving adjuvant ADT.""","""['Julie Abildgaard', 'Hein Vincent Stroomberg', 'A Kirstine Bang', 'Jakob Albrethsen', 'Laura Smedegaard Kruuse', 'Anders Juul', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Andreas Røder', 'Niels Jørgensen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Developments in the control of testicular function.', 'Insulin-like growth factor-1 is associated with regulation of the luteinizing hormone production in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for localized prostate cancer.', 'Kinetics of testosterone recovery in clinically localized prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy and subsequent short-term adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy.', 'A comparative study on the efficacies of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and GnRH antagonist in neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy combined with transperineal prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Advances with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

Six themes were identified from the patient interviews focusing on HCP and patient roles related to care coordination and patient awareness of communication among their HCPs. Four themes were identified from HCP interviews related to the context of care coordination and experience with eOncoNote.

Most of the major advances in motion management to date have focused on correcting this one aspect of the tumor motion, translation. However, large prostate rotation up to 30° has been measured. As the technological innovation evolves toward delivering increasingly precise radiotherapy, it is important to quantify the clinical benefit of translational and rotational motion correction over translational motion correction alone.  Purpose:   The purpose of this work was to quantify the dosimetric impact of intrafractional dynamic rotation of the prostate measured with a six degrees-of-freedom tumor motion monitoring technology.  Methods:   The delivered dose was reconstructed including (a) translational and rotational motion and (b) only translational motion of the tumor for 32 prostate cancer patients recruited on a 5-fraction prostate SBRT clinical trial. Patients on the trial received 7.25 Gy in a treatment fraction. A 5 mm clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin was applied in all directions except the posterior direction where a 3 mm expansion was used. Prostate intrafractional translational motion was managed using a gating strategy, and any translation above the gating threshold was corrected by applying an equivalent couch shift. The residual translational motion is denoted as T r e s $T_{res}$ . Prostate intrafractional rotational motion R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ was recorded but not corrected. The dose differences from the planned dose due to T r e s $T_{res}$ + R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ , ΔD( T r e s $T_{res}$ + R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ ) and due to T r e s $T_{res}$ alone, ΔD( T r e s $T_{res}$ ), were then determined for CTV D98, PTV D95, bladder V6Gy, and rectum V6Gy. The residual dose error due to uncorrected rotation, R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ was then quantified: Δ D R e s i d u a l $\Delta D_{Residual}$ = ΔD( T r e s $T_{res}$ + R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ ) - ΔD( T res ${T}_{\textit{res}}$ ).  Results:   Fractional data analysis shows that the dose differences from the plan (both ΔD( T r e s $T_{res}$ + R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ ) and ΔD( T r e s $T_{res}$ )) for CTV D98 was less than 5% in all treatment fractions. ΔD( T r e s $T_{res}$ + R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ ) was larger than 5% in one fraction for PTV D95, in one fraction for bladder V6Gy, and in five fractions for rectum V6Gy. Uncorrected rotation, R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ induced residual dose error, Δ D R e s i d u a l $\Delta D_{Residual}$ , resulted in less dose to CTV and PTV in 43% and 59% treatment fractions, respectively, and more dose to bladder and rectum in 51% and 53% treatment fractions, respectively. The cumulative dose over five fractions, ∑D( T r e s $T_{res}$ + R u n c o r r $R_{uncorr}$ ) and ∑D( T r e s $T_{res}$ ), was always within 5% of the planned dose for all four structures for every patient.  Conclusions:   The dosimetric impact of tumor rotation on a large prostate cancer patient cohort was quantified in this study. These results suggest that the standard 3-5 mm CTV-PTV margin was sufficient to account for the intrafraction prostate rotation observed for this cohort of patients, provided an appropriate gating threshold was applied to correct for translational motion. Residual dose errors due to uncorrected prostate rotation were small in magnitude, which may be corrected using different treatment adaptation strategies to further improve the dosimetric accuracy.""","""['Chandrima Sengupta', 'Simon Skouboe', 'Thomas Ravkilde', 'Per Rugaard Poulsen', 'Doan Trang Nguyen', 'Peter B Greer', 'Trevor Moodie', 'Nicholas Hardcastle', 'Amy J Hayden', 'Sandra Turner', 'Shankar Siva', 'Keen-Hun Tai', 'Jarad Martin', 'Jeremy T Booth', ""Ricky O'Brien"", 'Paul J Keall']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Geometric and dosimetric comparison of four intrafraction motion adaptation strategies for stereotactic liver radiotherapy.', 'Pelvic organ motion and dosimetric implications during horizontal patient rotation for prostate radiation therapy.', 'DMLC tracking and gating can improve dose coverage for prostate VMAT.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Adaptive optimization by 6 DOF robotic couch in prostate volumetric IMRT treatment: rototranslational shift and dosimetric consequences.', 'Dynamic intrafractional position monitoring with implanted fiducial markers for enhanced accuracy in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.']"""

Design:   Phase III open-label randomised controlled trial.  Setting:   Single tertiary cancer centre in Toronto, Canada.  Participants:   Men 50 years of age and older with no history of PSA screening for ≥3 years, a negative digital rectal exam and no prior prostate biopsy.  Interventions:   Patients were recommended to undergo a prostate biopsy if their PSA was ≥2.6 ng/mL (PSA arm) or if they had a PIRADS score of 4 or 5 (MRI arm). Patients underwent an end-of-study PSA in the MRI arm.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Adenocarcinoma on prostate biopsy. Prostate biopsy rates and the presence of clinically significant prostate cancer were also compared.  Results:   A total of 525 patients were randomised, with 266 in the PSA arm and 248 in the MRI arm. Due to challenges with accrual and study execution during the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was terminated early. In the PSA arm, 48 patients had an abnormal PSA and 28 (58%) agreed to undergo a prostate biopsy. In the MRI arm, 25 patients had a PIRADS score of 4 or 5 and 24 (96%) agreed to undergo a biopsy. The relative risk for MRI to recommend a prostate biopsy was 0.52 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.82, p=0.005), compared with PSA. The cancer detection rate for patients in the PSA arm was 29% (8 of 28) vs 63% (15 of 24, p=0.019) in the MRI arm, with a higher proportion of clinically significant cancer detected in the MRI arm (73% vs 50%). The relative risk for detecting cancer and clinically significant with MRI compared with PSA was 1.89 (95% CI 0.82 to 4.38, p=0.14) and 2.77 (95% CI 0.89 to 8.59, p=0.07), respectively.  Conclusions:   Prostate MRI as a stand-alone screening test reduced the rate of prostate biopsy. The number of clinically significant cancers detected was higher in the MRI arm, but this did not reach statistical significance. Due to early termination, the study was underpowered.

However, price transparency, which is critical in healthcare decisions, is not a quality measure included for accreditation. We reported the rates of price disclosure of surgical procedures for 5 cancers (breast, lung, cutaneous melanoma, colon, and prostate) among hospitals ranked by the American College of Surgeon's Commission on Cancer (ACS-CoC).  Methods:   We identified nonfederal, adult, and noncritical access ACS-CoC accredited hospitals and used the commercial Turquoise Health database to perform a cross-sectional analysis of hospital price disclosures for 5 common oncologic procedures (mastectomy, lobectomy, wide local excision for cutaneous melanoma, partial colectomy, prostatectomy). Publicly available financial reporting data were used to compile facility-specific features, including bed size, teaching status, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid wage index, and patient revenues. Modified Poisson regression evaluated the association between price disclosure and ACS-CoC accreditation after adjusting for hospital financial performance.  Results:   Of 1,075 total ACS-CoC accredited hospitals, 544 (50.6%) did not disclose prices for any of the surgical procedures and only 313 (29.1%) hospitals reported prices for all 5 procedures. Of the 5 oncologic procedures, prostatectomy and lobectomy had the lowest price disclosure rates. Disclosing and nondisclosing hospitals significantly differed in ACS-CoC accreditation, ownership type, and teaching status. Hospitals that disclosed prices were more likely to receive Medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments, have lower average charge to cost ratios (4.53 vs 5.15; P<.001), and have lower net hospital margins (-2.03 vs 0.44; P=.005). After adjustment, a 1-point increase in markup was associated with a 4.8% (95% CI, 2.2%-7.4%; P<.001) higher likelihood of nondisclosure.  Conclusions:   More than half of the hospitals did not disclose prices for any of the 5 most common oncologic procedures despite ACS-CoC accreditation. It remains difficult to obtain price transparency for common oncologic procedures even at centers of excellence, signaling a discordance between quality measures visible to patients.""","""['Yuqi Zhang', 'Marcelo Cerullo', 'Andrew Esposito', 'Vishnukamal Golla']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Large Variations in the Prices of Urologic Procedures at Academic Medical Centers 1 Year After Implementation of the Price Transparency Final Rule.', 'The Price-Quality Mismatch: Are Negotiated Prices for Total Joint Arthroplasty Associated With Hospital Quality in a Large California Health System?', 'Hospital Prices for Pediatric Tympanostomy Tube Placement and Adenotonsillectomy in 2021.', 'Evaluation of Hospital Compliance With Federal Price Transparency Regulations and Variability of Negotiated Rates for Spinal Fusion.', 'Do Magnet®-accredited hospitals show improvements in nurse and patient outcomes compared to non-Magnet hospitals: a systematic review.']"""

We develop a PET agent, [89Zr]-DFO-DLL3-scFv, that detects DLL3 levels in mouse SCNC models. In multiple patient-derived xenograft models, AMG 757 (tarlatamab), a half-life-extended bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immunotherapy that redirects CD3-positive T cells to kill DLL3-expressing cells, exhibited potent and durable antitumor activity. Late relapsing tumors after AMG 757 treatment exhibited lower DLL3 levels, suggesting antigen loss as a resistance mechanism, particularly in tumors with heterogeneous DLL3 expression. These findings have been translated into an ongoing clinical trial of AMG 757 in de novo and t-SCNC, with a confirmed objective partial response in a patient with histologically confirmed SCNC. Overall, these results identify DLL3 as a therapeutic target in SCNC and demonstrate that DLL3-targeted BiTE immunotherapy has significant antitumor activity in this aggressive prostate cancer subtype.

Loss of T cell stemness, poor expansion capacity, and exhaustion during prolonged tumor antigen exposure are major causes of CAR T cell therapeutic resistance. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of CAR T cells from a first-in-human trial in metastatic prostate cancer identified two independently validated cell states associated with antitumor potency or lack of efficacy. Low expression of PRDM1, encoding the BLIMP1 transcription factor, defined highly potent TCF7 [encoding T cell factor 1 (TCF1)]-expressing CD8+ CAR T cells, whereas enrichment of HAVCR2 [encoding T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM-3)]-expressing CD8+ T cells with elevated PRDM1 was associated with poor outcomes. PRDM1 knockout promoted TCF7-dependent CAR T cell stemness and proliferation, resulting in marginally enhanced leukemia control in mice. However, in the setting of PRDM1 deficiency, a negative epigenetic feedback program of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-driven T cell dysfunction was identified. This program was characterized by compensatory up-regulation of NR4A3 and other genes encoding exhaustion-related transcription factors that hampered T cell effector function in solid tumors. Dual knockout of PRDM1 and NR4A3 skewed CAR T cell phenotypes away from TIM-3+CD8+ and toward TCF1+CD8+ to counter exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating CAR T cells and improve antitumor responses, effects that were not achieved with PRDM1 and NR4A3 single knockout alone.

Methods:   This retrospective study included patients who underwent MRI within 1 year after RP between November 2019 and October 2020. DCE findings and their concordance with the presence and location of positive surgical margin (PSM) were assessed using RP specimens. Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic impact of DCE findings for BCR.  Results:   Among the 272 men (mean age ± standard deviation, 66.6 ± 7.4 years), focal nodular enhancement was more frequently observed in those with PSM compared to those with negative margin (85.4% versus 14.6%; p < 0.001). The sites of focal nodular enhancement were 72.9% (35/48) concordant with the PSM locations. Focal nodular enhancement was associated with a higher Gleason score, higher preoperative PSA (≥ 10 ng/mL), higher Gleason grade at the surgical margin, and non-limited margin involvement (p = 0.002, 0.006, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively). In patients without BCR at the time of MRI, focal nodular enhancement was associated with a shorter time to BCR (p < 0.001) and a significant factor predicting 1-year BCR in both univariate (odds ratio = 8.4 [95% CI: 2.5-28.3]; p = 0.001) and multivariate (odds ratio = 5.49 [1.56-19.3]; p = 0.008) analyses.  Conclusions:   Focal nodular enhancement on post-prostatectomy MRI was associated with adverse clinico-pathologic characteristics of high risk for recurrence and can be a predictor for 1-year BCR in patients undergoing RP.

Materials and methods:   We identified 124 consecutive prostate cancer patients from 2008 to 2018 with a solitary oligorecurrent metastatic lesion on positron emission tomography imaging who were treated with metastasis-directed therapy without androgen deprivation therapy from the Mayo Clinic C-11 choline registry. Metastasis-directed therapy consisted of either stereotactic body radiation therapy or surgical excision.  Results:   Of these 124 patients, 67 were treated with surgery (median follow-up 54 months) and 57 patients were treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (median follow-up 53 months). Of patients treated with surgery, 80.5% had &gt;50% decline in prostate specific antigen at first follow-up, and the 3-year radiographic progression-free survival was 29%. Median time to initiation of systemic therapy in this cohort was 18.5 months (interquartile range 8.4-44.7 months). Meanwhile, for patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy, 40.3% had &gt;50% decline in prostate specific antigen at first follow-up, and the 3-year radiographic progression-free survival was 17%. Similarly, median time to initiation of systemic therapy was 17.8 months (interquartile range 7.1-42.3 months).  Conclusions:   This study represents the first reported series of metastasis-directed therapy without androgen deprivation therapy in patients with solitary oligorecurrent metastatic prostate cancer.

Therefore, there is high demand for novel therapeutic candidates targeting AR itself or aberrant AR signalling to suppress the progression to or the growth of CPRC. Here, we report that ginsenoside compound K (GCK), the primary bioactive metabolite biotransformed from protopanaxadiol (PPD) ginsenoside, acts as a novel AR signalling inhibitor by transcriptionally suppressing AR expression and tumour growth in athymic nude mice. GCK inhibited cell growth in LNCaP, PC-3 and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell lines and suppressed the expression levels of cell cycle regulators. GCK down-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers such as vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), whereas E-cadherin was significantly increased in GCK-stimulated LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Moreover, GCK treatment markedly decreased both AR and AR-V7 protein levels in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells, possibly by decreasing AR promoter activity. Experiments with AR promoter-deleted constructs revealed that the region between -412 and -227 is critical for GCK regulation. GCK treatment in athymic nude mice implanted with 22Rv1 CRPC cell lines significantly suppressed tumour growth and AR expression levels in tumour tissues. Collectively, our results suggest that GCK, as a novel AR inhibitor, could be a potential therapeutic agent against prostate cancer and an effective chemopreventive agent to delay the progression to CRPC.""","""['Mingyue Jiang', 'You Sun', 'Kyung Song']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Recruitment of miR-8080 by luteolin inhibits androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', '20(S)-protopanaxadiol inhibition of progression and growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy Followed by Androgen Receptor Inhibition as Sequential Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.']"""

The patients were initially classified into 5 subgroups according to metastatic patterns as follows: simple bone metastases (G1), concomitant bone and regional lymph node (LN) metastases (G2), concomitant bone and nonregional LN (NRLN) metastases (G3), lung metastases (G4), and liver metastases (G5). In addition, patients in the G3 group were subclassified as G3a and G3b based on the LN metastatic plane (below or above the diaphragm, respectively). The associations of different metastatic patterns with castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The results showed that patients in G1 and G2 had relatively favorable clinical outcomes, patients in G3a and G4 had intermediate prognoses, and patients in G3b and G5 had the worst survival outcomes.

Based on the evidence that prostate cancer lesions before treatment are the most common sites of tumor residual or recurrence after treatment, simultaneous integrated boost radiation therapy for prostate cancer has been proven to have the advantage of improving efficacy without increasing toxicities.  Methods:   This study is a prospective phase II randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of functional imaging-guided carbon ion irradiation with simultaneous integrated boost for localized prostate cancer. One hundred and forty patients with localized prostate cancer will be randomized into carbon ion radiotherapy group and simultaneous integrated boost carbon ion radiotherapy group at a 1:1 ratio. The primary endpoint is to compare the incidence of treatment-related grade 2 and higher acute toxicities between the two groups according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03. Secondary endpoints are late toxicities, biochemical relapse-free survival, overall survival, progression-free survival, and quality of life.  Discussion:   This study adopts functional imaging-guided simultaneous integrated boost of carbon ion radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, aiming to evaluate the differences in the severity and incidence of acute toxicities in patients with localized prostate cancer treated with carbon ion radiotherapy and simultaneous integrated boost carbon ion radiotherapy, in order to optimize the carbon ion treatment strategy for localized prostate cancer.

Complete deletions and differential expression of the human glycosyltransferase UGT2B17 and UGT2B28 genes are linked to prostate cancer (PCa) risk and progression, leukaemia, autoimmune and other diseases.  Methods:   The systemic metabolic consequences of UGT deficiencies were examined using untargeted and targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling of carefully matched, treatment-naive PCa cases.  Results:   Each UGT KO differentially affected over 5% of the 1545 measured metabolites, with divergent metabolic perturbations influencing the same pathways. Several of the perturbed metabolites are known to promote PCa growth, invasion and metastasis, including steroids, ceramides and kynurenine. In UGT2B17 KO, reduced levels of inactive steroid-glucuronides were compensated by sulfated derivatives that constitute circulating steroid reservoirs. UGT2B28 KO presented remarkably lower levels of oxylipins paralleled by reduced inflammatory mediators, but higher ceramides unveiled as substrates of the enzyme in PCa cells.

We surveyed practicing US radiation oncologists (ROs) to determine the proportion who offer BT for PC and whether the COVID-19 pandemic influenced practice patterns.  Materials and methods:   From July-October 2021, we surveyed practicing US ROs. Provider demographic and practice characteristics were collected. Questions assessing utilization of BT and external beam (EBRT) for patients of varying risk groups and the effect of the pandemic on practice patterns were administered. Descriptive statistics were reported. The bivariate relationships between provider characteristics and likelihood of offering BT were assessed using the Chi-square test (α < 0.05).  Results:   Six percent of surveyed ROs responded, with 203 meeting inclusion criteria (72% male, 72% white, 53% non-academic, 69% >10 years in practice) and 156 (77%) treating PC. For low-risk, fewer providers offered BT (41% total; 25% low dose rate [LDR], 10% high dose rate [HDR], 6% both) than stereotactic body (SBRT) (54%) and moderately hypofractionated radiation therapy (MHFRT) (83%). For favorable intermediate risk, fewer offered BT (37% total; 21% LDR, 10% HDR, 6% both) than SBRT (48%), MHFRT (87%), and conventionally fractionated EBRT (38%). For high (44%) and very-high (37%) risk, fewer offered EBRT+BT than EBRT alone. For every risk group, academic ROs were significantly more likely to offer BT (all p-values<0.05). <1% of respondents reported increased pandemic-related BT usage.  Conclusions:   US ROs, particularly in non-academic settings, do not routinely offer BT monotherapy or boost (<50%). Practice patterns were unaffected by COVID-19.

A subgroup of 232 patients also underwent prostate mpMRI. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracies of PSA, PHI, and mpMRI as predictors of PCa or csPCa. These predictive accuracies were quantified by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The different predictive models were compared using the DeLong test.  Results:   Logistic regression showed that age, PSA, PHI, and prostate volume were significant predictors of both PCa and csPCa. In the mpMRI subgroup, age, PSA level, PHI, prostate volume, and mpMRI were predictors of both PCa and csPCa. The PHI (area under the curve [AUC]=0.693) was superior to the PSA level (AUC=0.615) as a predictor of PCa (p=0.038). Combining PHI and mpMRI showed the most accurate prediction of both PCa and csPCa (AUC=0.833, 0.881, respectively).  Conclusions:   The most accurate prediction of both PCa and csPCa can be performed by combining PHI and mpMRI. In the absence of mpMRI, PHI is superior to PSA alone as a predictor of PCa, and adding PHI to PSA can increase the detection rate of both PCa and csPCa.""","""['Changhee Ye', 'Jin-Nyoung Ho', 'Dan Hyo Kim', 'Sang Hun Song', 'Hwanik Kim', 'Hakmin Lee', 'Seong Jin Jeong', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Hyungwoo Ahn', 'Sung Il Hwang', 'Hak Jong Lee', 'Sangchul Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Investig Clin Urol""","""['The predictive value of the prostate health index vs. multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer diagnosis in prostate biopsy.', ""Negative Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer: What's Next?"", 'MRI combined with PSA density in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL: Biparametric versus multiparametric MRI.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

We propose an interpretable deep learning-based path-reasoning framework (iDPath) for drug discovery and repurposing by capturing MODA on by far the most comprehensive multilayer biological network consisting of the complex high-dimensional molecular interactions between genes, proteins and chemicals. Experiments show that iDPath outperforms state-of-the-art machine learning methods on a general drug repurposing task. Further investigations demonstrate that iDPath can identify explicit critical paths that are consistent with clinical evidence. To demonstrate the practical value of iDPath, we apply it to the identification of potential drugs for treating prostate cancer and hypertension.

Therefore, in the current study, we aim to evaluate the expression levels of key factors of DNA damage response in human breast, lung and prostate cancer cell lines in response to treatment with quercetin and thymoquinone.  Methods:   MTT assay was applied to assess the effects of quercetin and thymoquinone on the viability of MCF-7, A549, and PC3 cancer cells. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to evaluate the expression levels of p53, RAD51, Ku70, XRCC1, and H2AX in treated cells. In addition, the expression rate of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) was assessed by ELISA kit.  Results:   The quercetin and thymoquinone induce cytotoxicity in breast, lung, and prostate cancer cells effectively; MCF-7 cells were the most sensitive cells to quercetin with an IC50 value of 50 μM and PC3 cells were more sensitive to thymoquinone with an IC50 value of 20 μM.

This study aimed to estimate the dosimetry and the preliminary clinical application of the [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-XL-2, which is a novel imaging tracer invented by our team that can specifically targets PSMA for PCa and its metastases.  Methods:   The single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) whole-body (WB) planar images were collected on 6 patients at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 h after 99mTc-PSMA-XL-2 injection, respectively. The SPECT/computed tomography (CT) scan was carried out immediately following the WB planar image scan performed after 2.0 h. The volumes of interest (VOIs) of the bladder, heart wall, intestines, kidneys, liver, lungs, and spleen were segmented in the SPECT/CT images. VOIs of the salivary glands and the whole body were drawn in SPECT planar images. The dosimetry toolkit was used to process the data and project the SPECT/CT images onto planar images. The dosimetry analysis was performed using the IDAC-Dose dosimetry software. Furthermore, other PCa patients were enrolled to study the preliminary clinical application of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-XL-2.  Results:   The clearance of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-XL-2 is primarily by the hepatobiliary and intestinal system, due to its lipophilic characteristic. The effective half-life of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-PSMA-XL-2 is about 3.90 h. High absorbed doses were observed in the salivary glands (1.93E-02 ± 3.88E-03 mSv/MBq), kidneys (1.63E-02 ± 7.32E-03 mSv/MBq) and spleen (1.21E-02 ± 2.64E-03 mSv/MBq). The total body effective dose was 4.84E-03 ± 9.30E-05 mSv/MBq.

Methods:   Two hundred consecutive prostate cancer patients who had undergone 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and 18F-NaF PET/CT at baseline evaluation (n = 80) and following suspected recurrence or disease progression (restaging) (n = 120) were analyzed retrospectively.  Results:   PSMA and NAF scans were positive for skeletal metastatic lesions in 67% (134 patients) and negative in 33% (66 patients). The scans were concordant in 80% (160 patients: 66 negative and 94 positive) and discordant in 20% (40 patients). Among 40 discordant results, 14 were baseline and 26 were restaging studies. PSMA detected more number of lesions in 11 (nine baseline and two restaging). These were true positive marrow or lytic metastatic lesions. NaF revealed more number of lesions in 29 (5 initial and 24 restaging). These were false positive on follow-up imaging. No statistical difference (P value = 0.7 by McNemar test) between the two scans for identifying absence or presence of at least one skeletal lesion was noted at baseline staging.  Conclusion:   Though, both 18F-NaF and 68Ga-PSMA are excellent tracers for evaluation of skeletal metastases in prostate cancer, there is a distinct advantage of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT due to detection of additional skeletal lesions and absence of false positive lesions. In addition, absence of PSMA avidity in healed metastases in the restaging setting opens up new avenue for assessment of response of skeletal metastases.""","""['Archi Agrawal', 'Aravintho Natarajan', 'Sneha Mithun', 'Ganesh Bakshi', 'Amit Joshi', 'Vedang Murthy', 'Santosh Menon', 'Nilendu Purandare', 'Sneha Shah', 'Ameya Puranik', 'Sayak Choudhury', 'Gagan Prakash', 'Mahendra Pal', 'Priyamvada Maitre', 'Kumar Prabhash', 'Vanita Noronha', 'Venkatesh Rangarajan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Comparison of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT with 18FNaF PET/CT in the evaluation of bone metastases in metastatic prostate cancer patients prior to radionuclide therapy.', 'A Prospective Comparison of 18F-Sodium Fluoride PET/CT and PSMA-Targeted 18F-DCFBC PET/CT in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Feasibility of Global Assessment of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer with 18F-Sodium Fluoride-PET/Computed Tomography.']"""

Given the higher incidence of prostate cancer in African American (AA) compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) men, this study compared reported rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening hypothesizing that it would not be commensurate with the relative risk between these two groups.  Methods:   Using the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we identified 43,685 men (40,301 NHW and 3384 AA) interviewed about PSA screening.  Results:   AA men had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-0.93; p = .004) of reporting PSA screening; sequentially correcting for access to care, smoking, and age had minimal effect on this finding, but when correcting for income significantly attenuated this difference (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.12). Further adding education level eliminated the effect size of AA race entirely with OR, 0.99 (95% CI, 0.84-1.17; p = .91). Further analysis found significant interaction between education and race, with college-educated AA men having 1.42 OR of receiving screening compared to college-educated NHW men.  Conclusions:   Despite prostate cancer being more common and having higher population-level mortality in AA than NHW men, PSA screening and education patterns do not reflect this increased risk even when adjusting for health access disparities. The authors' findings of significant effect from both income and education suggest that systemic racism is an important factor in the observed difference in PSA screening between AA men and NHW men.  Lay summary:   In the United States, prostate cancer is more common in African American men New guidelines from 2018 encourage physicians to consider risk factors in deciding whether or not to recommend screening, but overall African American men continue to be screened at a lower rate than non-Hispanic White men This effect disappears when correcting for income and education level, suggesting that several factors including systemic racism, medical mistrust, and self-advocacy may impact this observed difference.""","""['Paul Riviere', 'Sandhya Kalavacherla', 'Matthew P Banegas', 'Juan Javier-Desloges', 'Maria Elena Martinez', 'Isla P Garraway', 'James D Murphy', 'Brent S Rose']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Racial and Ethnic Variation in PSA Testing and Prostate Cancer Incidence Following the 2012 USPSTF Recommendation.', 'Does Veteran Status Mitigate Racial Disparities in Prostate Cancer Screening?

Focal ablation using ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has demonstrated promising short and medium-term oncological outcomes. Advancements in HIFU therapy such as the introduction of tissue change monitoring (TCM) aim to further improve treatment efficacy.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between intraoperative TCM during HIFU focal therapy for localized prostate cancer and oncological outcomes 12 mo afterward.  Design, setting, and participants:   Seventy consecutive men at a single institution with prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled. Men with prior treatment, metastases, or pelvic radiation were excluded to obtain a final cohort of 55 men.  Intervention:   All men underwent HIFU focal therapy followed by magnetic resonance (MR)-fusion biopsy 12 mo later. Tissue change was quantified intraoperatively by measuring the backscatter of ultrasound waves during ablation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Gleason grade group (GG) ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included GG ≥1 cancer, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores ≥3, and evidence of tissue destruction on post-treatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A Student's t - test analysis was performed to evaluate the mean TCM scores and efficacy of ablation measured by histopathology. Multivariate logistic regression was also performed to identify the odds of residual cancer for each unit increase in the TCM score.  Results and limitations:   A lower mean TCM score within the region of the tumor (0.70 vs 0.97, p = 0.02) was associated with the presence of persistent GG ≥2 cancer after HIFU treatment. Adjusting for initial prostate-specific antigen, PI-RADS score, Gleason GG, positive cores, and age, each incremental increase of TCM was associated with an 89% reduction in the odds (odds ratio: 0.11, confidence interval: 0.01-0.97) of having residual GG ≥2 cancer on postablation biopsy. Men with higher mean TCM scores (0.99 vs 0.72, p = 0.02) at the time of treatment were less likely to have abnormal MRI (PI-RADS ≥3) at 12 mo postoperatively. Cases with high TCM scores also had greater tissue destruction measured on MRI and fewer visible lesions on postablation MRI.  Conclusions:   Tissue change measured using TCM values during focal HIFU of the prostate was associated with histopathology and radiological outcomes 12 mo after the procedure.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at how well ultrasound changes of the prostate during focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer predict patient outcomes. We found that greater tissue change measured by the HIFU device was associated with less residual cancer at 1 yr. This tool should be used to ensure optimal ablation of the cancer and may improve focal therapy outcomes in the future.""","""['Yash S Khandwala', 'Simon John Christoph Soerensen', 'Shravan Morisetty', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'Richard E Fan', 'Sulaiman Vesal', 'Mirabela Rusu', 'Geoffrey A Sonn']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Medium-term Oncological Efficacy and Patient-reported Outcomes After Focal High-intensity Focused Ultrasound: The FOXPRO Trial.', 'Prostate cancer treatment by the latest focal HIFU device with MRI/TRUS-fusion control biopsies: A prospective evaluation.', 'Evaluation of post-ablation mpMRI as a predictor of residual prostate cancer after focal high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) ablation.', 'High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer: A Review.', 'Focal Treatment for Unilateral Prostate Cancer Using High-Intensity Focal Ultrasound: A Comprehensive Study of Pooled Data.']"""

Reports have shown survival benefit with radiation (XRT), surgery, and hormone (ADT) in localized disease. The objective of this study was to assess treatment trends and overall survival (OS) among men 75 years of age and older with cT1c PCa.  Methods:   The National Cancer Database was queried to identify patients with cT1c PCa, aged 75 years and older, between 2004 and 2016. We excluded individuals with N1/NX or M1/MX disease, unknown treatment, treatment with both XRT and surgery, surgery other than radical prostatectomy (RP), or PSA > 10 ng/ml. We described 4 treatment cohorts: observation, XRT, surgery, and ADT alone. Treatment trends and OS were analyzed using SPSS.  Results:   Among 49,843 patients, 7% had surgery, 66% had XRT, 5% had ADT alone, and 22% were observed. From 2004-2016, a large decline in XRT was noted, with an increase in surgery and observation. Men receiving ADT alone were significantly older, with higher Gleason's score, and lower incomes. Cox regression revealed survival benefit for surgery and XRT (HR 0.44 and 0.69, P < .001 respectively); ADT had worse survival than observation (HR 1.23, P < .001).  Conclusion:   Fewer men 75 years of age and older with cT1c PCa are being diagnosed and treated. Rates of XRT have declined, with rises in surgery and observation.

Our goal was to explore and identify factors associated with patient-reported SFB in CaP survivors.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional study of 264 adult individuals with a history of CaP that completed the AHRQ - Medical Expenditures Panel Survey - Household Component and Cancer Self-Administered Questionnaire Supplement in 2016 or 2017.

Multivariable ordinal logistic regression and logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with the severity of SFB and different domains of burden.  Results:   Most participants were non-Hispanic white, had 3 or more comorbidities and had a median age of 72 years. 62.1% of survivors indicated SFB associated with their CaP care and long-term effects. 49.2% of CaP survivors indicated coping SFB, 27.7% psychological, and 29.2% material. Older (OR: 0.95, 95%CI 0.92-0.98) was associated with less SFB. Low-income level (OR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.01-4.36) was associated with higher SFB.

We compared MRI vs. non-MRI diagnostic pathways among patients receiving radical prostatectomy (RP) for impact on surgical outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Men diagnosed with CaP and receiving RP at Loyola University Medical Center (2014-2021) were categorized into MRI or non-MRI diagnostic pathways based on receipt of MRI before prostate biopsy. Primary outcomes of interest included positive surgical margin (PSM) rates, the performance of bilateral nerve-sparing, and biochemical recurrence (BCR). Multivariable logistic regression models, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards regression were employed.  Results:   Of 609 patients, 281 (46.1%) were in the MRI and 328 (53.9%) in the non-MRI groups. MRI patients had similar PSA, biopsy grade group (GG) distribution, RP GG, pT stage, and RP CaP volume compared to non-MRI patients. PSM rates were not statistically different for the MRI vs. non-MRI groups (22.8% vs. 26.8%, P = 0.25). Bilateral nerve-sparing rates were higher for the MRI vs. non-MRI groups (OR 1.95 (95%CI 1.32-2.88), P = 0.001). The MRI group demonstrated improved BCR (HR 0.64 (95%CI 0.41-0.99), P = 0.04) after adjustment for age, PSA, RP GG, pT, pN, and PSM status. On meta-analysis, a 5.2% PSM reduction was observed but high heterogeneity for use of nerve-sparing.

Methods:   We identified all patients who underwent ORP at our institution between 2000 and 2020. A standardized pad test was used to determine the early continence rates upon catheter removal, the late continence around a year after surgery was determined by the number of pads per day. The Clavien-Dindo classification was used to report the complication rates. The biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. Multivariable Cox-regression models were used to test the effect of different factors on biochemical recurrence.  Results:   We analyzed 1095 patients. The median follow-up was 93.4 months. An overall 10-year BCR-free survival and OS of 73% and 82% respectively was found. A complication rate for Clavien Dindo≥3 was seen in 4.8% of patients.

In this work, we characterized the biochemical changes evoked by IL-6 in three different models of PCa cells, including LNCaP, C4-2, and PC3. The effect of IL-6 on PCa cells was compared with the effect obtained by co-stimulation with the cAMP-inducing agent forskolin (FSK). Stimulation of LNCaP cells with IL-6 or IL-6 + FSK evoked increased expression of the neuroendocrine marker tubulin IIIβ and Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channel subunit. PC3 cells, representing a more advanced state of PCa, had high levels of tubulin IIIβ expression without any further changes observed by treatment with IL-6 or IL-6 + FSK. Elevated expression of the glucocorticoid receptor was observed in PC3, but not in LNCaP or C4-2 cells. Glucocorticoid receptor expression was not regulated by IL-6 stimulation of LNCaP or C4-2 cells. IL-6 acting alone or together with FSK evoked a significant reduction in the expression of the transcription factor REST and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein Rb1. In LNCaP cells, IL-6 acting alone or together with FSK had no effect on the expression of several biological markers of advanced PCa, including Aurora kinase A, valosin-containing protein, calcium-sensing receptor, calreticulin, S100A protein, and Protein S. In PC3 cells, co-treatment with IL-6 + FSK evoked increased expression of REST and S100A proteins, as well as a reduction in Protein S levels.

Three dual-trained radiologist/nuclear medicine physicians re-reported the mpMRI and PSMA-PET both independently and synchronously for the same patients in random order, blinded to previous results. Diagnostic performance was assessed for mpMRI/PSMA-PET images read synchronously or independently and then synthesized. Agreement between imaging results and histopathology was examined. 'Concordance' between imaging modalities was defined as overlapping lesions. Reporting certainty was evaluated by the individual reporters for each modality.  Results:   International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group ≥2 cancer was present in 60% of patients on biopsy. Synchronous reading of mpMRI/PSMA-PET increased sensitivity compared to mpMRI or PSMA-PET alone (93% vs 80% vs 88%, respectively), although specificity was not improved (63% vs 58% vs 78%, respectively). No significant difference in diagnostic performance was noted between mpMRI/PSMA-PET read synchronously and mpMRI or PSMA-PET reported independently and then synthesized. Most patients had concordant imaging (60%), while others had discordant lesions only (28%) or a mixture (concordant and discordant lesions; 12%). When mpMRI/PSMA-PET findings were concordant and positive, 95% of patients had clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). When PSMA-PET alone was compared to synchronous PSMA-PET/MRI reads, there was an improvement in reader certainty in 20% of scans.  Conclusion:   Synchronous mpMRI/PSMA-PET reading improves reader certainty and sensitivity for csPCa compared to mpMRI or PSMA-PET alone. However, synthesizing the results of independently read PSMA-PET and mpMRI reports provided similar diagnostic performance to synchronous PSMA-PET/MRI reads. This may provide greater flexibility for urologists in terms of referral patterns, reducing healthcare system costs and improving efficiencies in prostate cancer diagnosis.""","""['Paul Doan', 'William Counter', 'Nathan Papa', 'Gemma Sheehan-Dare', 'Bao Ho', 'Jonathan Lee', 'Victor Liu', 'James E Thompson', 'Shikha Agrawal', 'Matthew J Roberts', 'James Buteau', 'Michael S Hofman', 'Daniel Moon', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Declan Murphy', 'Phillip D Stricker', 'Louise Emmett']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['The PRIMARY Score: Using Intraprostatic 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT Patterns to Optimize Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Protocol for the PRIMARY clinical trial, a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional study of the additive diagnostic value of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography/computed tomography to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnostic setting for men being investigated for prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron-emission tomography (PET) and multiparametric (mp)MRI to detect intermediate-grade intra-prostatic prostate cancer using whole-mount pathology: impact of the addition of 68 Ga-PSMA PET to mpMRI.', 'Diagnostic Performance of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography-targeted biopsy for Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).']"""

Calculating PV from MRI is a time-consuming, radiologist-dependent task. The aim of this study was to assess whether a deep learning algorithm can replace PI-RADS 2.1 based ellipsoid formula (EF) for calculating PV.  Methods:   Eight different measures of PV were retrospectively collected for each of 124 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and preoperative MRI of the prostate (multicenter and multi-scanner MRI's 1.5 and 3 T). Agreement between volumes obtained from the deep learning algorithm (PVDL) and ellipsoid formula by two radiologists (PVEF1 and PVEF2) was evaluated against the reference standard PV obtained by manual planimetry by an expert radiologist (PVMPE). A sensitivity analysis was performed using a prostatectomy specimen as the reference standard. Inter-reader agreement was evaluated between the radiologists using the ellipsoid formula and between the expert and inexperienced radiologists performing manual planimetry.  Results:   PVDL showed better agreement and precision than PVEF1 and PVEF2 using the reference standard PVMPE (mean difference [95% limits of agreement] PVDL: -0.33 [-10.80; 10.14], PVEF1: -3.83 [-19.55; 11.89], PVEF2: -3.05 [-18.55; 12.45]) or the PV determined based on specimen weight (PVDL: -4.22 [-22.52; 14.07], PVEF1: -7.89 [-30.50; 14.73], PVEF2: -6.97 [-30.13; 16.18]). Inter-reader agreement was excellent between the two experienced radiologists using the ellipsoid formula and was good between expert and inexperienced radiologists performing manual planimetry.  Conclusion:   Deep learning algorithm performs similarly to radiologists in the assessment of prostate volume on MRI.

Materials and methods:   This was a retrospective population-based cohort study of men with nmCRPC in Ontario, Canada between January 2007-March 2018. Patients with prostate cancer, castrate level of testosterone(<1.7nmol/L) and a PSA>2.0ng/mL with a subsequent rise>25% from the nadir, and without metastasis were included. Annual prevalence of nmCRPC was calculated. Crude time from nmCRPC to metastasis and all-cause death are presented as medians with interquartile range(IQR). Predictors of time from nmCRPC to death were compared using univariable and multivariable cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   We identified 2045 patients with nmCRPC. Median age was 79(IQR:72-84). 984 patients(48.1%) received upfront hormonal therapy while 583(28.5%) received initial radiotherapy and 478(23.4%) underwent radical prostatectomy. Median time from primary treatment to nmCRPC was 6 years(IQR:3-10). The average annual prevalence of nmCRPC was 8% among men receiving ADT. Crude median time from nmCRPC to death was 37.6 months(IQR:22.1-55.4). Median time from nmCRPC to metastasis and metastasis to death was 20.0 and 8.3 months, respectively. Patients who had primary surgery experienced longer crude survival. Older patients, patients who had a higher PSA at nmCRPC, and patients with grade group 4 to 5 disease had a shorter time from nmCRPC to death.

Differences in inflammatory signaling between localized and metastatic disease may point to opportunities for early intervention.  Methods:   We modeled PCa disease progression by analyzing RNA-seq of localized vs. metastatic patient samples, followed by CIBERSORTx to assess their immune cell populations. The VHA CDW registry of PCa patients was analyzed for anti-TNF clinical outcomes.  Results:   We observed statistically significant opposing patterns of IL-6 and TNFα expression between localized and metastatic disease. IL-6 was robustly expressed in localized disease and downregulated in metastatic disease. The reverse was observed with TNFα expression. Metastatic disease was also characterized by downregulation of adhesion molecule E-selectin, matrix metalloproteinase ADAMTS-4 and a shift to M2 macrophages whereas localized disease demonstrated a preponderance of M1 macrophages. Treatment with anti-TNF agents was associated with earlier stage disease at diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Our data points to clearly different inflammatory contexts between localized and metastatic prostate cancer. Primary localized disease demonstrates local inflammation and adaptive immunity, whereas metastases are characterized by immune cold microenvironments and a shift towards resolution of inflammation and tissue repair.

We aimed to estimate the prevalence, characteristics and general practice resource usage of people living with both conditions in England.  Methods:   Anonymised electronic healthcare records from 391 National Health Service general practices across England using the TPP SystmOne general practice system were obtained from ResearchOne. Data included demographic and clinical characteristics, and general practice healthcare useage (appointments, prescriptions, referrals and secondary care contacts) for people aged 50 and over with a cancer and/or dementia diagnosis consistent with the Quality and Outcomes Framework between 2005 and 2016. Multi-level negative binomial regression was used to analyse the association between having cancer and/or dementia and the number of general practice appointments.  Results:   Data from 162,371 people with cancer and/or dementia were analysed; 3616 (2.2%) people were identified as having comorbid cancer and dementia. Of people with cancer, 3.1% also had dementia, rising to 7.5% (1 in 13 people) in those aged 75 and over. Fewer people with both conditions were female (50.7%) compared to those with dementia alone (65.6%) and those with comorbid cancer and dementia were older than those with cancer alone [mean ages 83 (sd = 7), 69 (sd = 12) respectively]. Those with both conditions were less likely to have lung cancer than those with cancer alone (7.5% vs. 10.3%) but more likely to have prostate cancer (20.9% vs. 15.8%). Additional comorbidities were more prevalent for those with both conditions than those with cancer or dementia alone (68.4% vs. 50.2% vs. 54.0%). In the year following the first record of either condition, people with cancer and dementia had 9% more general practice appointments (IRR:1.09, 95% CI:1.01-1.17) than those with cancer alone and 37% more appointments than those with dementia alone (IRR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.28-1.47).

One of the most powerful yet computationally possible algebraic techniques for measuring the topological characteristics of functions is persistent homology. It's an algebraic invariant that can capture topological details at different spatial resolutions. Persistent homology investigates the topological features of a space using a set of sampled points, such as pixels. It can track the appearance and disappearance of topological features caused by changes in the nested space created by an operation known as filtration, in which a parameter scale, in our case the intensity of pixels, is increased to detect changes in the studied space over a range of varying scales. In addition, at the level of machine learning there were many studies and articles witnessing recently the combination between homological persistence and machine learning algorithms. On another level, prostate cancer is diagnosed referring to a scoring criterion describing the severity of the cancer called Gleason score. The classical Gleason system defines five histological growth patterns (grades). In our study we propose to study the Gleason score on some glands issued from a new optical microscopy technique called SLIM. This new optical microscopy technique that combines two classic ideas in light imaging: Zernike's phase contrast microscopy and Gabor's holography. Persistent homology features are computed on these images. We suggested machine learning methods to classify these images into the corresponding Gleason score. Machine learning techniques applied on homological persistence features was very effective in the detection of the right Gleason score of the prostate cancer in these kinds of images and showed an accuracy of above 95%.""","""['Abbas Rammal', 'Rabih Assaf', 'Alban Goupil', 'Mohammad Kacim', 'Valeriu Vrabie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Persistent Homology for the Quantitative Evaluation of Architectural Features in Prostate Cancer Histology.', 'Automated gleason grading on prostate biopsy slides by statistical representations of homology profile.', 'Development of a Deep Learning Algorithm for the Histopathologic Diagnosis and Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer Biopsies: A Pilot Study.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Grading of Prostate Cancer: Past, Present, and Future.', 'Persistent Homology-Based Machine Learning Method for Filtering and Classifying Mammographic Microcalcification Images in Early Cancer Detection.']"""

However, physiological PSMA uptake of ganglia of the sympathetic trunk can be quickly misinterpreted as possible PSMA-positive lymph node metastases. The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake and its intra-individual reproducibility in ganglia of the sympathetic trunk.  Methods:   We retrospectively included 28 consecutive patients (median age 69 ± 9 with a range of 49-90) with biochemical recurrence of PCa who underwent [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT scan and, accordingly, a follow-up examination between August 2018 and August 2021. Cervical, coeliac, and sacral ganglia were identified on the iterative PET reconstructions and correlated with CT component. Tracer uptake of ganglia was determined by measuring SUVmax and SUVmean values. Anatomical position of the ganglia in relation to adjacent vertebral bodies were noted. Statistical analyses were conducted using two-way repeated measures ANOVA and descriptive statistics.  Results:   The highest [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake was found in coeliac ganglia followed by cervical and sacral ganglia. The SUVmax in coeliac ganglia was 3.13 ± 0.85 (follow-up scan 3.11 ± 0.93), in cervical ganglia 2.73 ± 0.69 (follow-up scan 2.67 ± 0.74), and in sacral ganglia 1.67 ± 0.50 (follow-up scan 1.64 ± 0.52).

In a given ganglion station, there was no statistically significant difference of SUVmax or SUVmean values between baseline and follow-up scans.  Conclusions:   The first systematically described physiological [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake in ganglia of the sympathetic trunk showed a low variability of SUVmax or SUVmean and a good intra-individual reproducibility of [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake in follow-up scans.

Here we show that increasing prostatic stromal Foxf2 suppresses the growth and progression of both syngeneic and autochthonous mouse prostate cancer models in an immunocompetent context. Mechanistically, Foxf2 moderately attenuates the CAF phenotype and transcriptionally downregulates Cxcl5, which diminish the immunosuppressive myeloid cells and enhance T cell cytotoxicity. Increasing prostatic stromal Foxf2 sensitizes prostate cancer to the immune checkpoint blockade therapies. Augmenting lung stromal Foxf2 also mediates an immunosuppressive milieu and inhibits lung colonization of prostate cancer.

China's population is aging at an increasing rate, so predicting the morbidity and mortality of prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer in China is of great significance to provide epidemiological evidence for forward planning and implementation of national health policies.  Methods:   Numbers of incidences and deaths by cancer (prostate, bladder and kidney), sex (male and female) and age groups from 1990 to 2019 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study. We applied Bayesian age-period-cohort models to predict incidences and deaths to 2030. We also calculated Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) and mortality rate (ASMR), their trends were quantified by estimated average percentage change (EAPC) and 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   Predictions suggest that by 2030, there will be 315,310 prostate cancer cases, 192,390 bladder cancer cases and 126,980 kidney cancer cases. The ASIRs will increase to 25.54/100,000 for prostate cancer (EAPC: 2.88, 95% CI, 2.84, 2.93), 7.54/100,000 for bladder cancer (EAPC: 2.58, 95% CI, 2.54, 2.61) and 5.63/100,000 for kidney cancer (EAPC: 4.78, 95% CI, 4.54, 5.02). Number of deaths in 2030 will be 81,540, 61,220, and 41,940, respectively. Different ASMR changes are observed, the ASMR for prostate cancer will drop to 7.69/100,000 (EAPC: -0.29, 95% CI, -0.31, -0.27), the ASMR for bladder cancer will stabilize at 2.49/100,000 (EAPC: 0.00, 95% CI, -0.02, 0.03), the ASMR of kidney cancer will increase to 1.84/100,000 (EAPC: 3.45, 95% CI, 3.22, 3.67). From 1990 to 2030, higher numbers of cases and rates are reported among males and in the 60 plus age group, both ASIR and ASMR of bladder and kidney cancers presents progressively widening differences between both males and females and between the < 60 and the ≥ 60 age groups.  Conclusion:   Morbidity and mortality of the three genitourinary cancers are predicted to increase further over the next decade.

Methods:   Thirty-nine patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer who were treated with radiotherapy were enrolled in this study. The acute radiotoxicity grades and fatigue levels were assessed during the radiotherapy and 1 month after the radiotherapy. Estimation of the late radiotoxicity was performed every three months in the first year, every four months in the second year, and then every six months. Serum levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 were determined before radiotherapy and after the 25th radiotherapy fraction by ELISA.  Results:   The significant positive association between diabetes mellitus and changes in acute genitourinary toxicity grades during the radiotherapy was observed in prostate cancer patients. In addition, patients who were smokers had significantly higher maximum fatigue levels in comparison with patients who were non-smokers. The circulating IL-6 levels were significantly higher after the 25th radiotherapy fraction in comparison with levels determined before radiotherapy. The significant positive correlations between pretreatment TGF-β1 levels and maximum genitourinary toxicity grades and between TGF-β1 levels after the 25th fraction and genitourinary toxicity grades after the 25th fraction, were found. The pretreatment IL-6 concentrations and TGF-β1 concentrations after the 25th fraction were positively correlated with maximum genitourinary toxicity grades. The IL-6 levels after the 25th fraction were positively associated with genitourinary toxicity grades after this fraction. The pretreatment IL-6 concentrations were significantly positively correlated with maximum fatigue scores. The significant positive correlation between IL-6 concentrations and fatigue scores after the 25th fraction was determined. The positive correlations between IL-6 and TGF-β1 concentrations measured after the 25th fraction and maximum fatigue scores were observed.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that serum levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 might influence the severity of acute genitourinary radiotoxicity and fatigue in patients with prostate cancer.

Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were chosen to develop atherosclerosis, of which the plaques were analyzed with administration of short- and long-term FSH imitating androgen deprivation therapy-induced and menopausal FSH elevation. The study showed that short- and long-term exposure of FSH significantly accelerated atherosclerosis progression in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, manifested as strikingly increased plaques in the aorta and its roots, increased macrophage content, reduced fibrin, and an enlarged necrotic core, suggesting a decrease in plaque stability. Furthermore, expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus GSE21545 dataset revealed that macrophage inflammation was tightly associated with FSH-induced atherosclerotic progression. The human monocyte cell line THP-1 was induced by PMA and worked as a macrophage model to detect inflammatory factors and cellular functions. FSH remarkably promoted the expression of IL-1β in macrophages and strikingly increased the chemotactic migratory capacity of macrophages toward MCP-1, but the promigratory capacity of FSH was attenuated in foam cells. Overall, we revealed that FSH significantly promoted the inflammatory response and migration of macrophages, thereby provoking atherosclerosis development.""","""['Jing-Li Han', 'Yu-Xuan Song', 'Wei-Juan Yao', 'Jing Zhou', 'Yiqing Du', 'Tao Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Provokes Macrophages to Secrete IL-1β Contributing to Atherosclerosis Progression.', 'IL-17A influences essential functions of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and is involved in advanced murine and human atherosclerosis.', 'Neopterin Counters Vascular Inflammation and Atherosclerosis.', 'The potential role of follicle-stimulating hormone in the cardiovascular, metabolic, skeletal, and cognitive effects associated with androgen deprivation therapy.', '99mTc-Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.']"""

Secretory salivary gland cells express the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and show significant uptake on PET scans using 68Ga/18F-PSMA-ligands. We aimed to objectively quantify the dose-response of salivary glands to RT using PSMA PET.  Methods and materials:   28H&N cancer patients received RT with 70 Gy in 35 fractions over 7 weeks. PSMA PET/CT was acquired at baseline (BL), during treatment (DT) and at 1-&6-months post-treatment (PT1M/PT6M). Dose, BL- PT1M- and PT6M-SUV were extracted for every voxel inside each parotid (PG) and submandibular (SMG) gland. The PT1M/6M data was analysed using a generalised linear mixed effects model.Patient-reported xerostomia and DT-PSMA loss was also analysed.  Results:   Dose had a relative effect on BL SUV. For a population average gland (BL-SUV of 10), every 1 Gy increment, decreased the PT1M/PT6M-SUV by 1.6 %/1.6 % for PGs and by 0.9 %/1.8 % for SMGs. TD50 of the population curves was 26.5/31.3 Gy for PGs, and 22.9/27.8 Gy for SMGs at PT1M /PT6M. PSMA loss correlated well with patient-reported xerostomia at DT/PT1M (Spearman's ρ = -0.64, -0.50).  Conclusion:   A strong relationship was demonstrated between radiation dose and loss of secretory cells in salivary glands derived using PSMA PET/CT. The population curve could potentially be used as a dose planning objective, by maximising the predicted post-treatment SUV.

This work presents a foundation for the detection of circulating mRNA in PCa on a non-invasive lab-on-chip device for use at the point-of-care. This technique was implemented onto a lab-on-chip platform integrating an array of chemical sensors (ion-sensitive field-effect transistors) for real-time detection of RNA.

Importantly, no functional imaging for HCC is clinically available, making diagnosis and surveillance following local therapies particularly challenging. 18F-DCFPyL binds with high affinity to PSMA yet clears rapidly from the blood pool. PET imaging with 18F-DCFPyL may represent a new tool for staging, surveillance and assessment of treatment response in HCC. The purpose of this Functional Imaging Liver Cancer (FLIC) trial is to assess the ability of 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT to detect sites of HCC.  Methods:   This is a phase II multi-site prospective imaging trial with a plan to enroll 50 subjects with suspected HCC on standard of care CT or MRI and eligible for standard local treatment. Participants will undergo a baseline 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT, prior to therapy. Subjects will also be scanned with 18F-FDG-PET/CT within 2 weeks of 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT. Participants will undergo histopathologic assessment and standard of care local treatment for HCC within a multidisciplinary team context. Participants with histopathologic confirmation of HCC and a positive baseline 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will undergo a post-treatment 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT during the first routine follow-up, typically within 4-8 weeks. Subjects with negative baseline 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT will not be re-scanned after treatment but will remain in follow-up. Participants will be followed for 5-years to assess for progression-free-survival. The primary endpoint is the positive predictive value of 18F-DCFPyL-PET for HCC as confirmed by histopathology. Secondary endpoints include comparison of 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT with CT, MRI, and 18F-FDG-PET/CT, and evaluation of the value of 18F-DCFPyL-PET/CT in assessing treatment response following local treatment. Exploratory endpoints include next generation sequencing of tumors, and analysis of extracellular vesicles to identify biomarkers associated with response to therapy.  Discussion:   This is a prospective imaging trial designed to evaluate whether PSMA-PET/CT imaging with 18F-DCFPyL can detect tumor sites, assess local treatment response in HCC patients, and to eventually determine whether PSMA-PET/CT could improve outcomes of patients with HCC receiving standard of care local therapy.

However, siRNAs are very labile and must be both protected and transported by nanoparticles to be efficiently delivered into cells. In this work, we used a Janus-type polycationic amphiphilic β-cyclodextrin derivative to efficiently transfect siRNAs targeting mRNAs encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase (p42-MAPK) or Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) into different cancer cell lines as well as astrocytes. We took advantage of this high transfection efficiency to simultaneously knock down p42-MAPK and Rheb to boost docetaxel (DTX)-mediated toxicity in two human prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3). We found that double knockdown of p42-MAPK and Rheb increased DTX-toxicity in LNCaP but not in PC3 cells. However, we also observed the same effect when scramble siRNA was used, therefore pointing to an off-target effect. Indeed, we found that the siRNA we used in this work induced toll-like receptor 3 activation, leading to β-interferon production and caspase activation.

Simple and disposable electrochemical immunosensors are highly desirable for screening and mobile detection of PSAs in high-risk populations. Here, an electrochemical immunosensor was constructed based on amino-rich nanochannels array-modified patterned, inexpensive, and disposable indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes, which can be employed for the sensitive detection of PSA. Using an amino-group-containing precursor, a vertically ordered mesoporous silica nanochannel film (VMSF) containing amino groups (NH2-VMSF) was rapidly grown on ITO. When NH2-VMSF contained template surfactant micelle (SM), the outer surface of NH2-VMSF was directionally modified by aldehyde groups, which enabled further covalent immobilization of the recognitive antibody to prepare the immuno-recognitive interface. Owing to the charge-based selective permeability, NH2-VMSF can electrostatically adsorb negatively charged redox probes in solution (Fe(CN)63-/4-). The electrochemical detection of PSA is realized based on the mechanism that the antigen-antibody complex can reduce the diffusion of redox probes in solution to the underlying electrode, leading to the decrease in electrochemical signal. The constructed immunosensor can achieve sensitive detection of PSA in the range from 10 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 8.1 pg/mL. Sensitive detection of PSA in human serum was also achieved.

We further show that copper-supplemented media sensitize normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) to curcumin-mediated growth inhibition, as determined by decreased cell proliferation. Copper supplementation results in increased expression of copper transporters CTR1 and ATP7A in MCF-10A cells, which is attenuated by the addition of curcumin in the medium.

Clinically, paclitaxel (PTX) (C47H51NO14), a diterpene alkaloid, is commonly used as an effective natural antineoplastic drug during the treatment of PCa. However, the mechanism and pathway involved in the function of PTX are poorly understood. In the current study, we employed the CCK-8 assay, revealing that PTX can inhibit the survival and induce the apoptosis of PC3M cells (a human prostate cancer cell line) in a concentration-dependent manner. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), as a metabolic intermediate produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain, are highly accumulated under the PTX treatment, which results in a sharp decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential in PC3M cells. Additionally, the migration and invasion of PC3M cells are weakened due to PTX treatment. Further analysis reveals that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), which functions as an antioxidant, not only rescues the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential induced by the abnormal ROS level, but also restores the migration and invasion of PC3M cells. In a subsequent exploration of the detailed mechanism, we found that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α works as a downstream gene that can respond to the increased ROS in PC3M cells. Under PTX treatment, the expression levels of HIF-1α mRNA and protein are significantly increased, which stimulate the activation of JNK/caspase-3 signaling and promote the apoptosis of PC3M cells. In summary, we demonstrate that PTX regulates the expression of HIF-1α through increased ROS accumulation, thereby promoting the activation of JNK/caspase-3 pathway to induce the apoptosis of PCa cells. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of antineoplastic action of taxanes and unveils the clinical benefit of the ROS-HIF-1α signaling pathway, which may offer a potential therapeutic target to prevent the development of PCa.""","""['Yan Zhang', 'Yedong Tang', 'Xiaoqiong Tang', 'Yuhua Wang', 'Zhenghong Zhang', 'Hongqin Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['A ROS/STAT3/HIF-1α signaling cascade mediates EGF-induced TWIST1 expression and prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'Actin-sequestering protein, thymosin beta-4, induces paclitaxel resistance through ROS/HIF-1alpha stabilization in HeLa human cervical tumor cells.', 'Resveratrol Induces Apoptosis in Murine Prostate Cancer Cells via Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α)/Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)/P53 Signaling.', 'Mitochondrial metabolism, redox signaling, and fusion: a mitochondria-ROS-HIF-1alpha-Kv1.5 O2-sensing pathway at the intersection of pulmonary hypertension and cancer.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.']"""

Post-treatment biochemical recurrence is a challenging issue. ATAD1 (ATPase Family AAA Domain Containing 1) plays a vital role in mitochondrial proteostasis and apoptosis activity, while its clinical value in PRAD and its impact on the tumor microenvironment (TME) remain unanswered. In this study, we aimed to investigate the clinical value and possible mechanisms of ATAD1 in PRAD via multi-omics analysis. Using cBioPortal, we confirmed that ATAD1 alteration was associated with gene expression and unfavorable DFS. Deep deletion predominantly occurred in PRAD. By integrating DriverDBv3 and GEPIA2, we noted ATAD1 downregulation in PRAD tissues compared to normal tissues, associated with unfavorable DFS in PRAD patients. DNA repair genes ATM, PARP1and BRCA2 had positive associations with ATAD1 expression. We found that the generalization value of ATAD1 could be applied to other cancers such as KIRC and UCEC. In addition, LinkedOmics identified that the functional involvement of ATAD1 participates in mitochondrial structure and cell cycle progression. Using TIMER analysis, we demonstrated that ATAD1 downregulation correlated with an immunosuppressive TME. Furthermore, we accessed a GSE55062 dataset on UALCAN and discovered the involvement of ERG-mediated transcriptional repression on ATAD1 downregulation. Cross-association screening of shATAD1 efficacy vs. altered mRNAs identified 190 perturbed mRNAs. Then, functional enrichment analysis using the Metascape omics tool recognized that shATAD1-perturbed mRNAs are primarily in charge of the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway and lipid metabolic processes. In conclusion, multi-omics results reveal that ATAD1 downregulation is a clinical biomarker for pathological diagnosis and prognosis for patients with PRAD. Reduced ATAD1 may be involved in the enhanced activity of mitochondria and cell cycle, as well as possibly shaping an immunosuppressive TME. ERG serves as an upstream transcriptional repressor of ATAD1. Downstream mechanisms of ATAD1 are involved in Wnt/β-catenin pathway and lipid metabolic processes.""","""['Chun-Chi Chen', 'Pei-Yi Chu', 'Hung-Yu Lin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life (Basel)""","""['Identifies microtubule-binding protein CSPP1 as a novel cancer biomarker associated with ferroptosis and tumor microenvironment.', 'The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Collateral deletion of the mitochondrial AAA+ ATPase ATAD1 sensitizes cancer cells to proteasome dysfunction.', 'The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.', 'Msp1/ATAD1 in Protein Quality Control and Regulation of Synaptic Activities.']"""

It has reached consensus that somatic and germline tests are necessary when treating advanced prostate cancer patients. Yet, it is unclear whether the mutations are associated with any presenting clinical features. We assessed the incidences and characteristics of BRCA2 mutated cancers by targeted sequencing in 126 sets of advanced prostate cancer tissue sequencing data. At the time of diagnosis, cT3/4, N1 and M1 stages were 107 (85%), 54 (43%) and 35 (28%) samples, respectively. BRCA2 alterations of clinical significance by AMP/ASCO/CAP criteria were found in 19 of 126 samples (15.1%). The BRCA2 mutated cancer did not differ in the distributions of TNM stage, Gleason grade group or histological subtype compared to BRCA2 wild-type cancers. Yet, they had higher tumor mutation burden, and higher frequency of ATM and BRCA1 mutations (44% vs. 10%, p = 0.002 and 21% vs. 4%, p = 0.018, respectively). Of the metastatic subgroup (M1, n = 34), mean PSA was significantly lower in BRCA2 mutated cancers than wild-type (p = 0.018). In the non-metastatic subgroup (M0, n = 64), PSA was not significantly different (p = 0.425). A similar trend was noted in multiple metastatic prostate cancer public datasets.

Cyclin dependent kinase 2 associate protein 1(CDK2AP1) is an epigenetic and cell cycle regulator gene which has been downregulated in several malignancies, but its involvement in PCa has not yet been investigated in a clinical setting. We assessed the prognostic value of CDK2AP1 expression in a cohort of men diagnosed with PCa (n = 275) treated non-surgically by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and studied the relationship between CDK2AP1 expression to various PCa molecular subtypes (ERG, PTEN, p53 and AR) and evaluated the association with clinical outcome. Further, we used bioinformatic tools to analyze the available TCGA PRAD transcriptomic data to explore the underlying mechanism. Our data confirmed increased expression of CDK2AP1 with higher Gleason Grade Group (GG) and metastatic PCa (p <0.0001). High CDK2AP1 expression was associated with worse overall survival (OS) (HR: 1.62, CI: 1.19−2.21, p = 0.002) and cause-specific survival (CSS) (HR: 2.012, CI 1.29−3.13, p = 0.002) using univariate analysis. When compared to each sub-molecular type. High CDK2AP1/PTEN-loss, abnormal AR or p53 expression showed even worse association to poorer OS and CCS and remained significant when adjusted for GG. Our data indicates that CDK2AP1 directly binds to p53 using the Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) technique, which was validated using molecular docking tools. This suggests that these two proteins have a significant association through several binding features and correlates with our observed clinical data. In conclusion, our results indicated that the CDK2AP1 overexpression is associate with worse OS and CSS when combined with certain PCa molecular subtypes; interaction between p53 stands out as the most prominent candidate which directly interacts with CDK2AP1.""","""['Yaser Gamallat', 'Andrea Bakker', 'Ealia Khosh Kish', 'Muhammad Choudhry', 'Simon Walker', 'Saood Aldakheel', 'Sima Seyedi', 'Kuo-Cheng Huang', 'Sunita Ghosh', 'Geoffrey Gotto', 'Tarek A Bismar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['High Serine-arginine Protein Kinase 1 Expression with PTEN Loss Defines Aggressive Phenotype of Prostate Cancer Associated with Lethal Outcome and Decreased Overall Survival.', 'The prognostic significance of combined ERG and androgen receptor expression in patients with prostate cancer managed by androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Knockdown of CDK2AP1 in primary human fibroblasts induces p53 dependent senescence.', 'Double edge: CDK2AP1 in cell-cycle regulation and epigenetic regulation.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate whether acetylation could enhance the anticancer activity and oral bioavailability of 5-DTAN. PC-3 human prostate cancer cells were treated with tangeretin (TAN), 5-DTAN, and 5-acetylated TAN (5-ATAN), and the results showed that the cytotoxic effect 5-ATAN (IC50 value of 5.1 µM) on the cell viability of PC-3 cells was stronger than that of TAN (IC50 value of 17.2 µM) and 5-DTAN (IC50 value of 11.8 µM). Compared to 5-DTAN, 5-ATAN treatment caused a more pronounced DNA ladder, increased the sub-G1 phase population, and induced G2/M phase arrest in the cell cycle of PC-3 cells. We also found that 5-ATAN triggered the activation of caspase-3 and the progression of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in PC-3 cells, suggesting the induction of apoptosis. In a cell wound healing test, 5-ATAN dose-dependently reduced the cell migration, and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was decreased after 48 h of 5-ATAN treatment. Moreover, oral administration of 5-ATAN showed a significantly stronger inhibitory effect on tumor size and tumor weight in tumor-bearing nude mice than those of vehicle or the 5-DTAN group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, pharmacokinetic results showed that single-dose oral administration of 5-ATAN exhibited a higher maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) of 5-DTAN in plasma than that of 5-DTAN. More extensive distribution of 5-DTAN to most tissues of mice was also observed in mice treated with 5-ATAN for 7 days.

Certain components of this system are dysregulated and play critical roles in the development/progression of different endocrine-related cancers. However, the presence and therapeutic role of this regulatory system in prostate cancer (PCa) remain poorly explored. Accordingly, we performed functional (proliferation/migration/colonies-formation) and mechanistic (Western-blot/qPCR/microfluidic-based qPCR-array) assays in response to SST and CORT treatments and CORT-silencing (using specific siRNA) in different PCa cell models [androgen-dependent (AD): LNCaP; androgen-independent (AI)/castration-resistant PCa (CRPC): 22Rv1 and PC-3], and/or in the normal-like prostate cell-line RWPE-1. Moreover, the expression of SST/CORT system components was analyzed in PCa samples from two different patient cohorts [internal (n = 69); external (Grasso, n = 88)]. SST and CORT treatment inhibited key functional/aggressiveness parameters only in AI-PCa cells. Mechanistically, antitumor capacity of SST/CORT was associated with the modulation of oncogenic signaling pathways (AKT/JNK), and with the significant down-regulation of critical genes involved in proliferation/migration and PCa-aggressiveness (e.g., MKI67/MMP9/EGF). Interestingly, CORT was highly expressed, while SST was not detected, in all prostate cell-lines analyzed. Consistently, endogenous CORT was overexpressed in PCa samples (compared with benign-prostatic-hyperplasia) and correlated with key clinical (i.e., metastasis) and molecular (i.e., SSTR2/SSTR5 expression) parameters. Remarkably, CORT-silencing drastically enhanced proliferation rate and blunted the antitumor activity of SST-analogues (octreotide/pasireotide) in AI-PCa cells. Altogether, we provide evidence that SST/CORT system and SST-analogues could represent a potential therapeutic option for PCa, especially for CRPC, and that endogenous CORT could act as an autocrine/paracrine regulator of PCa progression.""","""['Prudencio Sáez-Martínez', 'Francisco Porcel-Pastrana', 'Jesús M Pérez-Gómez', 'Sergio Pedraza-Arévalo', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'Juan M Jiménez-Vacas', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Raúl M Luque']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Somatostatin receptor subtype 1 as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Unleashing the Diagnostic, Prognostic and Therapeutic Potential of the Neuronostatin/GPR107 System in Prostate Cancer.', 'Obesity alters gene expression for GH/IGF-I axis in mouse mammary fat pads: differential role of cortistatin and somatostatin.', 'Truncated somatostatin receptors as new players in somatostatin-cortistatin pathophysiology.', 'Somatostatin and its receptor family.', 'Aberrations of DNA Repair Pathways in Prostate Cancer-The State of the Art.']"""

The intraoperative combination of fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) may be very helpful for improving tumour margin delineation and cancer therapy. PSMA is a transmembrane protein overexpressed in 90−100% of PCa cells. The goal of this work is the development of a PSMA-targeted Near InfraRed Fluorescent probe to offer the surgeon a valuable intraoperative tool for allowing a complete tumour removal, implemented with the possibility of using PDT to kill the eventual not resected cancer cells. PSMA-617 binding motif was conjugated to IRDye700DX-NHS and the conjugation did not affect the photophysical characteristics of the fluorophore. The affinity of IRDye700DX-PSMA-617 towards PCa cells followed the order of their PSMA expression, i.e., PC3-PIP > LNCaP > PC3, PC3-FLU. NIRF imaging showed a significant PC3-PIP tumour uptake after the injection of 1 or 5 nmol with a maximum tumour-to-muscle ratio (ca. 60) observed for both doses 24 h post-injection. Importantly, urine, healthy prostate, and the bladder were not fluorescent at 24 h post-injection. Flow cytometry and confocal images highlighted a co-localization of PSMA+ cells with IRDye700DX-PSMA uptake. Very interestingly, ex vivo analysis on a tumour specimen highlighted a significant PSMA expression by tumour-associated macrophages, likely attributable to extracellular vesicles secreted by the PSMA(+) tumour cells. FGS proved that IRDye700DX-PSMA was able to easily delineate tumour margins. PDT experiments showed a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability (from 75% at 10 nM to 12% at 500 nM), whereas controls did not show any cytotoxicity. PC3-PIP tumour-bearing mice subjected to photodynamic therapy showed a delayed tumour growth.

Immunotherapy has shown a lot of potential for various types of solid tumors, but the benefits have been less impressive in PCa. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is one of the three core subunits of the polycomb repressive complex 2 that has histone methyltransferase activity, and the immune effects of EZH2 in PCa are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the potential of EZH2 as a prognostic factor and an immune therapeutic biomarker for PCa, as well as the expression pattern and biological functions. All analyses in this study were based on publicly available databases, mainly containing Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), UCSCXenaShiny, and TISIDB. We performed differential expression analysis, developed a prognostic model, and explored potential associations between EZH2 and DNA methylation modifications, tumor microenvironment (TME), immune-related genes, tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor neoantigen burden (TNB), and representative mismatch repair (MMR) genes. We also investigated the molecular and immunological characterizations of EZH2. Finally, we predicted immunotherapeutic responses based on EZH2 expression levels. We found that EZH2 was highly expressed in PCa, was associated with a poor prognosis, and may serve as an independent prognostic factor. EZH2 expression in PCa was associated with DNA methylation modifications, TME, immune-related genes, TMB, TNB, and MMR. By gene set enrichment analysis and gene set variation analysis, we found that multiple functions and pathways related to tumorigenesis, progression, and immune activation were enriched. Finally, we inferred that immunotherapy may be more effective for PCa patients with low EZH2 expression. In conclusion, our study showed that EZH2 could be a potentially efficient predictor of prognosis and immune response in PCa patients.""","""['Tian-Qi Du', 'Ruifeng Liu', 'Qiuning Zhang', 'Hongtao Luo', 'Zhiqiang Liu', 'Shilong Sun', 'Xiaohu Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['BRCA1 and EZH2 cooperate in regulation of prostate cancer stem cell phenotype.', 'Multiomics characteristics and immunotherapeutic potential of EZH2 in pan-cancer.', 'EZH2 is a potential prognostic predictor of glioma.', 'EZH2, a prominent orchestrator of genetic and epigenetic regulation of solid tumor microenvironment and immunotherapy.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Epigenetic regulation in the tumor microenvironment: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.']"""

Surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapy are currently the standard treatment options for PCa. These have poor outcomes and result in the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is the foremost underlying cause of mortality associated with PCa. Taxanes, diterpene compounds approved to treat hormonal refractory PCa, show poor outcomes in CRPC. Polygodial (PG) is a natural sesquiterpene isolated from water pepper (Persicaria hydropiper), Dorrigo pepper (Tasmannia stipitata), and mountain pepper (Tasmannia lanceolata). Previous reports show that PG has an anticancer effect. Our results show that PG robustly inhibits the cell viability, colony formation, and migration of taxane-resistant CRPC cell lines and induces cell cycle arrest at the G0 phase. A toxicity investigation shows that PG is not toxic to primary human hepatocytes, 3T3-J2 fibroblast co-cultures, and non-cancerous BPH-1 cells, implicating that PG is innocuous to healthy cells. In addition, PG induces oxidative stress and activates apoptosis in drug-resistant PCa cell lines. Our mechanistic evaluation by a proteome profiler-human apoptotic array in PC3-TXR cells shows that PG induces upregulation of cytochrome c and caspase-3 and downregulation of antiapoptotic markers. Western blot analysis reveals that PG activates apoptotic and DNA damage markers in PCa cells. Our results suggest that PG exhibits its anticancer effect by promoting reactive oxygen species generation and induction of apoptosis in CRPC cells.""","""['Reshmii Venkatesan', 'Mohamed Ali Hussein', 'Leah Moses', 'Jennifer S Liu', 'Salman R Khetani', 'Alexander Kornienko', 'Gnanasekar Munirathinam']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The genoprotective capacity was studied by in vivo and in vitro micronucleus assays. Radioprotective capacity was evaluated by clonogenic cell survival, MTT, apoptosis and intracellular glutathione assays comparing radiosensitive cells (human prostate epithelium, PNT2) with radioresistant cells (murine metastatic melanoma, B16F10).

The prevalence of mutations in homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathway genes, including BRCA1/2, as well as treatment patterns and clinical outcomes, are not well characterized among Japanese men with mCRPC.  Methods:   This multicenter, noninterventional cohort study enrolled Japanese men with mCRPC from 24 institutions between 2014 and 2018. Mutations in the 15 HRR-related genes were assessed using archival primary or metastatic tumor samples. Patterns of sequential therapies for mCRPC were investigated. Patients were followed up for survival evaluation including prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (PSA-PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Of the 143 patients analyzed, HRR-related mutations were detected in 51 patients (35.7%). The most frequently mutated genes were CDK12 (N = 19, 13.3%), followed by BRCA2 (N = 18, 12.6%), ATM (N = 8, 5.6%), and CHEK2 (N = 3, 2.1%). The most common type of first-line therapy for mCRPC was next-generation hormonal agents (NHA, 44.4%), followed by first-generation antiandrogens (FGA, 30.3%), and taxanes (22.5%). Commonly prescribed first-/second-line sequential regimens included FGA/NHA (17.6%), NHA/NHA (15.5%), and NHA/taxanes (14.1%). The median PSA-PFS and OS for the entire cohort were 5.6 and 26.1 months, respectively. Patients carrying BRCA1/2 mutations had numerically shorter PSA-PFS (median 3.3 vs. 5.9 months) and OS (median 20.7 vs. 27.3 months) than those without mutations.

Methods:   We retrospectively enrolled metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients treated with androgen receptor targeted agents between December 2016 and January 2022. All patients experienced an oligoprogression (defined as the appearance and/or the progression of ⩽5 bone or nodal or soft tissue metastases) during treatment with androgen receptor targeted agents and received stereotactic body radiotherapy upon oligoprogressive sites, preserving the androgen receptor targeted agents. Further stereotactic body radiotherapy upon new metastatic sites was permitted. Patients showing visceral metastases or receiving palliative radiotherapy were excluded. Progressive disease at >5 metastatic sites or the appearance of visceral metastases led to a change of the systemic treatment. Primary endpoints were 36-month survival rate and 36-month rate of patients receiving treatment with androgen receptor targeted agents. Secondary endpoints were local disease control, biochemical response and safety.  Results:   We analyzed data from 30 patients. The 36-month survival rate was 90% (27 patients); 36-month rate of patients who were still on treatment with androgen receptor targeted agents was 50%. 20 of 30 patients had performed imaging control after a single course of stereotactic body radiotherapy: overall response rate was 50%, while clinical benefit was 93%. No ⩾G2 adverse events related to stereotactic body radiotherapy were recorded.  Conclusions:   Stereotactic body radiotherapy in oligoprogressive metastatic sites during androgen receptor targeted agent treatment resulted in a feasible and effective treatment to delay the start of next-line systemic treatment and prolong overall survival in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

MAPK8IP2 has been reported to be closely associated with several cancers. However, the biological function of MAPK8IP2 in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear.  Methods:   MAPK8IP2 expression in PCa and subgroups of PCa was analyzed by public databases. The prognostic role of MAPK8IP2 in prostate cancer was analyzed using the Cox regression method. The potential mechanism by which MAPK8IP2 affects PCa progression was investigated by utilizing public data, including genetic alteration, DNA methylation, m6A methylation, and immune infiltration data. We further performed in vitro assays to validate the effect of MAPK8IP2 on PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion.  Results:   MAPK8IP2 is highly expressed in PCa tissues. Overexpression of MAPK8IP2 is associated with adverse clinicopathological factors and a poor prognosis in PCa. Receiver operating curve analysis showed that MAPK8IP2 can distinguish PCa tissues from non-PCa tissues with a certain accuracy (AUC = 0.814). The MAPK8IP2 genetic alteration rate was 2.6% and MAPK8IP2 alterations correlated with a poor prognosis. We also found that CDK12 and TP53 mutations were associated with MAPK8IP2 expression. The DNA methylation level of MAPK8IP2 was higher in primary tumors than in normal tissues, and the high MAPK8IP2 DNA methylation group of PCa patients had poor survival.

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of the challenging patient position and CO2 insufflation in perineal space during RAPP on both hemodynamic parameters and respiratory mechanics. Hemodynamic and respiratory parameters of 30 patients who underwent RAPP and 31 patients who underwent Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) for prostate cancer between 2017 and 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Comparison between RAPP and RALP patients showed that anesthesia, surgery and insufflation times were shorter in RAPP patients (p < 0.05). Blood pCO2 level was higher, and the pH decrease was more prominent in the RAPP patients 30 and 60 min after perineal CO2 insufflation (p < 0.05). The mean arterial pressures, driving pressure, Ppeak and Pplato values were statistically higher in the RALP patients and 60 min after insufflation while static and dynamic lung compliance values were found to be lower. Our results showed that blood pCO2 level may severely increase after perineal CO2 insufflation. The fact that respiratory mechanics are less affected despite the difficult patient position for lungs in RAPP patients, the presence of higher CO2 level supports that the perineal CO2 insufflation plays a more important role in increased CO2 level.

One of the promising opportunities for the early diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer is the assessment of the glycolytic profile of the tumor by determining the expression of monocarboxylates (MCT) types 1 and 4 in tumor cells, as well as in adjacent stromal cells.  Materials and methods:   An analysis of patients of who underwent radical prostatectomy at the Institute of Urology and Reproductive Health of Sechenov University from 2015 to 2017 was carried out. The patients with histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma were included in the study. Among them, the presence or absence of biochemical recurrence during the first year was studied. An immunohistochemical (IHC) study of postoperative specimen was performed to determine the expression of MCT1 and MCT4 by tumor and stromal cells. The correlation between the intensity of their expression and the risk of biochemical recurrence and the tumor characteristics was evaluated.  Results:   High membrane expression of MCT1 directly correlated with high stromal expression of MCT4 (r=0.314, p<0.003). A significant direct correlation was found between the predominance of stromal expression of MCT4 over membrane expression and biochemical recurrence (r=0.403, p<0.001), as well as a high ISUP group (4 and 5) (r=0.294, p=0.005).

Along with this, controversial data are presented on the relationship between post-infectious chronic inflammation and neoplastic changes in prostate tissues.  Objective:   To carry out, based on the experimental data: 1) assessment of the degree of bacterial contamination and the severity of histological changes in prostate tissues on the 60th follow-up day in case of transurethral infection with various uropathogens in titers of 102,3,5 CFU/ml; 2) fundamental comparative analysis between the indicators of the inoculated test-titer and microbial load with the severity of histological changes in prostate tissues; 3) verification of neoplastic transformations in the prostate tissues during a long-term persistent bacterial-induced inflammatory process.  Materials and methods:   Animal studies were conducted using FELASA protocols. Laboratory animals: 14 New Zealand rabbits. Tested uropathogens: aerobes - E. coli, S. haemolyticus, anaerobes - P. niger. Titers: 102,3,5 CFU/ml. Uropathogen inoculation technique: topical transurethral.  Randomization:   all laboratory animals were divided into 5 groups according to the uropathogen (4 experimental, 1 control). Follow-up period: 60 days. Sacrification and autopsy of the animals were performed on day 60. Biopsies were taken from various parts of the prostate, as well as from the bladder neck and the edge of the membranous urethra. Cultural, histological and immunohistochemical (expression of p53 and Ki-67) studies of prostate tissues were conducted. Statistical data processing was performed using the GraphPad Prism 9.0 program (GraphPad Software Inc., Graphpad Holdings LLC, San Diego, CA, USA) applying descriptive and non-parametric statistics.  Results:   Two individuals infected with S. haemolyticus + P. niger had a lethal outcome. The contamination of prostate tissue was determined in all cases of infection. In 88.9% of the cases, an increase in tissue microbial load was determined compared to the initial titer. Multivariate analysis of culture study values revealed the presence of intragroup differences in prostate contamination only between infection with E. coli 103 CFU/ml and E. coli 105 CFU/ml (p=0.006), as well as intergroup differences between infection with E. coli 105 CFU/ml and P. niger 105 CFU/ml (p=0.013). The histological study revealed moderate proliferative inflammation after inoculation with 102,3,5 CFU/ml in the E. coli and S. haemolyticus groups. In the case of S. haemolyticus, it was more pronounced due to the presence of persistent alterative lesion foci; in the P. niger group, mild proliferative transformations were observed in prostate tissues in all cases. The immunohistochemical study of changes determined p53 expression (10.0%) in some areas of the glandular epithelium of prostate glands (but without a positive internal control) only in case of infection with E. coli 105 CFU/ml. Areas of glandular epithelium with Ki-67 expression ( less or equal 25.0%) were visualized in all tested groups, mainly at titers of 103 and 105 CFU/ml, but the severity of proliferative activity was not high (1+). There were no foci of prostate tissue with simultaneous nuclear activity of p53 and Ki-67.  Conclusion:   Proliferative inflammation of different intensity in prostate tissues was observed after sixty days. Its severity was mainly determined by the type of infecting agent (S. haemolyticus > E. coli > P. niger) and was not dependent on the inoculated titer and the subsequent microbial load of prostate tissues. No areas of neoplastic transformation of prostate tissues were reliably identified in the case of a bacterial-induced inflammatory process in the estimated follow-up period.""","""['M I Kogan', 'R S Ismailov', 'S S Todorov', 'Yu L Naboka', 'I A Gudima']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Are bacteriological and pathomorphological signs of bacterial prostatitis related between?

However, extended blood circulation of nanomedicines can increase drug exposure to leukocytes and lead to hematological toxicity. Here, we report a two-stage release strategy to enhance the drug deposition and antitumor efficacy of OxPt/SN38 core-shell nanoparticles with a hydrophilic oxaliplatin (OxPt) prodrug coordination polymer core and a lipid shell containing a hydrophobic cholesterol-conjugated SN38 prodrug (Chol-SN38). By conjugating cholesterol to the phenol group of SN38 via an acetal linkage and protecting the 20-hydroxy position with a trimethylsilyl (TMS) group, Chol-SN38 releases SN38 in two stages via esterase-catalyzed cleavage of the acetal linkage in the liver followed by acid-mediated hydrolysis of the TMS group to preferentially release SN38 in tumors. Compared to irinotecan, OxPt/SN38 reduces SN38 blood exposure by 9.0 times and increases SN38 tumor exposure by 4.7 times. As a result, OxPt/SN38 inhibits tumor growth on subcutaneous, spontaneous, and metastatic tumor models by causing apoptotic and immunogenic cell death. OxPt/SN38 exhibits strong synergy with the immune checkpoint blockade to regress subcutaneous colorectal and pancreatic tumors with 33-50% cure rates and greatly inhibits tumor growth and invasion in a spontaneous prostate cancer model and a liver metastasis model of colorectal cancer without causing side effects. Mechanistic studies revealed important roles of enhanced immunogenic cell death and upregulated PD-L1 expression by OxPt/SN38 in activating the tumor immune microenvironment to elicit potent antitumor immunity.

We hypothesized that differences may also exist in response to taxanes, which may inform treatment sequencing decisions.  Methods:   mCRPC patients (N = 158) with deleterious ATM or BRCA2 mutations who received taxanes, PARPi, or both were retrospectively identified from 11 US academic centers. Demographic, treatment, and survival data were collected. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed and Cox hazard ratios (HR) were calculated for progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS), from time of first taxane or PARPi therapy.  Results:   Fifty-eight patients with ATM mutations and 100 with BRCA2 mutations were identified. Fourty-four (76%) patients with ATM mutations received taxane only or taxane before PARPi, while 14 (24%) received PARPi only or PARPi before taxane. Patients with ATM mutations had longer PFS when taxane was given first versus PARPi given first (HR: 0.74 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.37-1.50]; p = 0.40). Similarly, OS was longer in patients with ATM mutations who received taxane first (HR: 0.56 [CI: 0.20-1.54]; p = 0.26). Among patients with BRCA2 mutations, 51 (51%) received taxane first and 49 (49%) received PARPi first.

Although several transcriptional and post-translational pathways for δ-catenin regulation have been identified in cancer cells, the potential effects of microRNA-mediated regulation remain elusive. Here, we used a δ-catenin 3'-UTR luciferase reporter assay to identify regulatory microRNAs. Subsequent bioinformatics analyses and molecular studies revealed that overexpression of miR-122 downregulated δ-catenin expression significantly via targeted binding to a seed sequence in the 3'-UTR region of δ-catenin, and suppressed the invasion, migration, and proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro. In a TRAMP-C2 mouse syngeneic prostate tumor model, stable expression of miR-122 decreased both δ-catenin expression and tumor growth. Mechanistically, overexpression of miR-122 inhibited the expression of δ-catenin-mediated downstream factors significantly in prostate cancer cells, including c-myc and cyclin D1. In cells overexpressing miR-122, there was no additive or synergistic effect of siRNA-mediated knockdown of δ-catenin on cell invasiveness, and overexpression of miR-122 alone had a more pronounced suppressive effect on cell invasion than knockdown of δ-catenin alone. These results suggest that miR-122 acts as tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, mainly by downregulating δ-catenin expression, but also by targeting other factors. Indeed, subsequent experiments showed that overexpression of miR-122 reduced the levels of the mRNAs encoding myc, snail, and VEGF in prostate cancer cells. Overall, our findings demonstrate that targeting of δ-catenin by miR-122 represses the motility and tumorigenesis of prostate cancer cells, indicating a tumor suppressive effect of this miRNA in prostate cancer.""","""['So-Yeon Park', 'Sung Jin Kim', 'Phuong Kim To', 'Rui Zhou', 'Kwonseop Kim', 'Kyung Keun Kim', 'Chaeyong Jung', 'Hangun Kim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Suppression of microRNA-454 impedes the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells by promoting N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 and inhibiting WNT/β-catenin signaling.', 'SOX30, a target gene of miR-653-5p, represses the proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells through inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'Capn4 expression is modulated by microRNA-520b and exerts an oncogenic role in prostate cancer cells by promoting Wnt/β-catenin signaling.', 'TUG1 knockdown inhibits the tumorigenesis and progression of prostate cancer by regulating microRNA-496/Wnt/β-catenin pathway.', 'MicroRNA-320 suppresses the stem cell-like characteristics of prostate cancer cells by downregulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.']"""

Besides this, PKP1 also occurs in a non-junctional, cytoplasmic form contributing to post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Moreover, PKP1 is expressed in the prostate epithelium but its expression is frequently downregulated in prostate cancers with a more aggressive phenotype. This observation may imply a tumour-suppressive role of PKP1. We found that, in prostatic adenocarcinomas with PKP1 deficiency, the occurrence of T-cells, B-cells, macrophages and neutrophils were significantly increased. In a PKP1-deficient prostatic cancer cell line expressing IL8, these levels were statistically meaningfully reduced upon PKP1 re-expression. When analysing prostatic PKP1 knockdown cell lines, the mRNA and protein levels of additional cytokines, namely CXCL1 and IL6, were upregulated. The effect was rescued upon re-expression of a PKP1 RNAi-resistant form. The corresponding mRNAs were co-precipitated with cytoplasmic PKP1, indicating that they are components of PKP1-containing mRNA ribonucleoprotein particles. Moreover, the mRNA half-lives of CXCL1, IL8 and IL6 were significantly increased in PKP1-deficient cells, showing that these mRNAs were stabilized by PKP1. In an in vitro migration assay, the higher cytokine concentrations led to higher migration rates of THP1 and PBMC cells. This finding implies that PKP1 loss of expression in vivo correlates with the recruitment of immune cells into the tumour area to set up a tumour-specific environment.

The purpose of this study is to describe long-term oncologic outcomes of patients receiving robotic radical cystectomy at a high-volume European Institution. We analyzed data of 107 patients treated with RARC between 2003 and 2012 at a high-volume robotic center. Clinical, pathologic, and survival data at the latest follow-up were collected. Clinical recurrence (CR)-free survival, cancer-specific mortality (CSM)-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were plotted using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Cox proportional hazard models investigated predictors of CR and CSM. Competing-risk regressions were utilized to depict cumulative incidences of death from BCa and death from other causes after RARC at long term. Pathologic nonorgan-confined BCa was found in 40% of patients, and 7 (7%) patients had positive soft tissue surgical margins. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of nodes removed was 11 (6, 14), and 26% of patients had pN + disease. Median (IQR) follow-up for survivors was 123 (117, 149) months.

In oncology, tumor heterogeneity assessment represents a pivotal step for effective treatment planning and prognosis prediction. Despite new procedures for DNA sequencing and analysis, non-invasive methods for tumor characterization are needed to impact on daily routine. On purpose, imaging texture analysis is rapidly scaling, holding the promise to surrogate histopathological assessment of tumor lesions. In this work, we propose a tree-based representation strategy for describing intra-tumor heterogeneity of patients affected by metastatic cancer. We leverage radiomics information extracted from PET/CT imaging and we provide an exhaustive and easily readable summary of the disease spreading. We exploit this novel patient representation to perform cancer subtyping according to hierarchical clustering technique. To this purpose, a new heterogeneity-based distance between trees is defined and applied to a case study of prostate cancer. Clusters interpretation is explored in terms of concordance with severity status, tumor burden and biological characteristics. Results are promising, as the proposed method outperforms current literature approaches. Ultimately, the proposed method draws a general analysis framework that would allow to extract knowledge from daily acquired imaging data of patients and provide insights for effective treatment planning.""","""['Lara Cavinato#', 'Matteo Pegoraro#', 'Alessandra Ragni', 'Martina Sollini', 'Paola Anna Erba', 'Francesca Ieva']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Author Correction: Imaging-based representation and stratification of intra-tumor heterogeneity via tree-edit distance.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Compared with Conventional Imaging for Initial Staging of Treatment-naïve Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Single-center Study.', 'Initial Experience with Volumetric 68Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT for Assessment of Whole-Body Tumor Burden as a Quantitative Imaging Biomarker in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan in biochemical recurrence after primary treatment for prostate cancer: a systematic review of the literature.']"""

However, variances in responses are observed and there is a need for biomarkers predicting treatment outcome and selection. In this study, we aimed to explore the predictive value of testosterone for first-line enzalutamide treatment of mCRPC.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 72 mCRPC patients with no prior abiraterone or docetaxel treatment was performed. Serum testosterone was measured using a liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry method. Association of pre- and during-enzalutimide treatment testosterone levels with progression-free survival (PFS) and failure-free survival (FFS) was investigated using univariate and multivariate Cox models. Testosterone levels were dichotomized into a low (Q1) and high (interquartile range-Q4) group.  Results:   Median PFS (7.4 v. 20.8 months, P<0.0001) and FFS (6.6 v. 17.7 months, P<0.0001) were shorter for patients with low testosterone levels (<0.217 nmol/L) during enzalutamide treatment. Furthermore, univariate Cox proportional hazards models revealed that low testosterone levels were associated with shorter PFS (HR 3.5, 95%CI 1.9-6.3; P<0.001) and FFS (HR 3.1, 95%CI 1.7-5.5; P<0.001). Pre-treatment testosterone levels were lower than during-treatment levels (P<0.0001) and low pre-treatment testosterone levels (<0.143 nmol/L) were associated with shorter median PFS (12.6 v. 20.5 months, P<0.01) and FFS (12.6 v. 22.5 months, P<0.01).  Conclusion:   The results of this study suggest that low serum testosterone levels during and prior to enzalutamide treatment can predict progression in mCRPC patients and identifies tumors resistant to next-in-line enzalutamide treatment.

In the world, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in the male population. New therapeutic strategies are needed for this tumor which still has a high mortality. A. arborescens leaves and aerial parts have various ethnopharmacological uses such as anti-spasmodic, and their decoctions were used to resolve urticaria, neuralgia and several lung diseases. Often this species has been also used to treat different inflammatory-related diseases such as cancer.  Aim of the study:   In a continuation of our research on essential oils from medicinal plants, we have selected, two essential oils from Artemisia arborescens L. (Compositae), an aromatic shrub widely used in traditional medicine. We evaluated their pro-apototic effect on androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive (DU-145) human prostate cancer cells. In this study, we also evaluated the anti-Signal transducer and transcription factor 3 (STAT-3) activity of both essential oils in the human prostate cancer cell lines, and the treatment with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Related Apoptosis (TRAIL).  Materials and methods:   The cells were exposed to essential oils for 72 h and cell viability and cell membrane integrity were evaluated. Genomic DNA and the activity of caspase-3 was tested to confirm the cell death for apoptosis. Western blot analysis was employed to evaluate the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved caspase-9, Hsp70, STAT-3 and SOD proteins. Assays to evaluate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and GSH levels were also performed.  Results:   The results showed the capacity of two essential oils to activate an apoptotic process increasing the inhibition of Hsp70 and STAT-3 protein expression. In addition, our natural products sensitize LNCaP cells to Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Related Apoptosis (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis.  Conclusions:   In summary, our study provides a further contribution to the hypothesis of the use of essential oils, from traditional medicinal plants, for the treatment of tumors, and suggests that the combination of our samples with other anti-prostate cancer therapies could be used to affect prostate cancer.""","""['Alessandra Russo', 'Adriana Graziano', 'Maurizio Bruno', 'Venera Cardile', 'Daniela Rigano']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Chamazulene-Rich Artemisia arborescens Essential Oils Affect the Cell Growth of Human Melanoma Cells.', 'Involvement of Bax and Bcl-2 in Induction of Apoptosis by Essential Oils of Three Lebanese Salvia Species in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'In vitro cytotoxicity of Artemisia vulgaris L. essential oil is mediated by a mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HL-60 leukemic cell line.', 'Analysis of the Essential Oils of Five Artemisia Species and Evaluation of their Cytotoxic and Proapoptotic Effects.', 'From longevity grass to contemporary soft gold: Explore the chemical constituents, pharmacology, and toxicology of Artemisia argyi H.Lév. & vaniot essential oil.', 'The Leaf Essential Oil of Myrtus communis subsp. tarentina (L.)

Hybrid PET/MRI allows simultaneous acquisition of PET and MRI data, thus combining the strength of both technologies allows the detection of bone marrow metastases that are missed by PET/CT. In this retrospective study, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of hybrid PET/MRI with Ga-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in detecting skeletal metastases in newly diagnosed PCa patients and compared the effectiveness of stand-alone PSMA PET reviewing versus stand-alone whole-body (WB) MRI evaluation. We also investigated the effect of the interpretation of all PET/MR data together on clinical management.  Methods:   We studied 74 newly diagnosed PCa patients who underwent PSMA PET/MRI for staging purposes. At first, PET and MRI were evaluated separately for bone lesions on a patient-and-lesion basis and then a further joint PSMA PET/MRI interpretation was made.  Results:   Patient-based sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy analysis for bone metastasis was, respectively, 1.0, 0.83, 0.54, 1.0, 0.86 for PET; 0.75, 0.96, 0.81, 0.95, 0.93 for WB MRI and 0.91, 0.95, 0.78, 0,98, 0.94 for PET/MRI. The combined PET/MRI evaluation changed the clinical impact in 13.5% of patients (eight correct and two wrong decisions) compared to PET stand-alone interpretation.  Conclusion:   PSMA PET imaging showed superior sensitivity to WB MRI in detecting bone metastases in newly diagnosed PCa patients, whereas WB MRI has superior specificity and PPV. Furthermore, the specificity and PPV of joint PET/MRI evaluation are better than PSMA PET alone. Despite the longer acquisition period, adding WB MRI sequences to PSMA PET imaging appears beneficial for PCa patient management.""","""['Sertac Asa', 'Eren Ozgur', 'Lebriz Uslu-Besli', 'Burak Ince', 'Sait Sager', 'Cetin Demirdag', 'Ekrem Guner', 'Haluk B Sayman', 'Baris Bakir', 'Kerim Sonmezoglu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in comparison with 18F-fluoride-PET/CT and whole-body MRI for the detection of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: a prospective diagnostic accuracy study.', 'Bone scintigraphy as a gatekeeper for the detection of bone metastases in patients with prostate cancer: comparison with Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Advances in PET imaging of cancer.']"""

Although patients initially show effective responses to bicalutamide treatment, resistance to bicalutamide frequently occurs and leads to the development of castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). This research investigated the roles of the oestrogen receptor α (ERα)-nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signalling pathway in bicalutamide resistance in PCa cells.  Methods:   We performed bioinformatic analysis and immunohistochemical staining on normal and cancerous prostate tissue to evaluate ERα and NRF2 expression and their correlation. Gene expression and localization in PCa cell lines were further investigated using real-time reverse transcription PCR/Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining. We treated PCa cells with the ER inhibitor tamoxifen and performed luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to understand ERα-dependent NRF2 expression. Overexpression and knockdown of ERα and NRF2 were used to explore the potential role of the ERα-NRF2 signalling axis in bicalutamide resistance in PCa cells.  Results:   We found that the expression of ERα and NRF2 was positively correlated and was higher in human CRPC tissues than in primary PCa tissues. Treatment with oestrogen or bicalutamide increased the expression of ERα and NRF2 as well as NRF2 target genes in PCa cell lines. These effects were blocked by pretreatment with tamoxifen. ChIP assays demonstrated that ERα directly binds to the oestrogen response element (ERE) in the NRF2 promoter. This binding led to increased transcriptional activity of NRF2 in a luciferase reporter assay. Activation of the ERα-NRF2 signalling axis increased the expression of bicalutamide resistance-related genes. Inhibition of this signalling axis by knockdown of ERα or NRF2 downregulated the expression of bicalutamide resistance-related genes and inhibited the proliferation and migration of PCa cells.  Conclusions:   We demonstrated the transcriptional interaction between ERα and NRF2 in CRPC tissues and cell lines by showing the direct binding of ERα to the ERE in the NRF2 promoter under oestrogen treatment. Activation of the ERα-NRF2 signalling axis contributes to bicalutamide resistance in PCa cells, suggesting that the ERα-NRF2 signalling axis is a potential therapeutic target for CRPC.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 338 intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with EBRT with ADT at our institution between 2000 and 2018. The median radiation dose was 76 Gy, the median initial PSA level was 17 ng/mL (range, 1-228 ng/mL), and the median duration of ADT was 24 months (range, 6-167 months). The median PSA level 1 months after EBRT was 0.06 ng/mL (range, 0-25.6 ng/mL). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Patient survival was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 5 years (range, 1-20 years). Multivariate analysis revealed that nPSA was an independent and significant factor associated with OS, PCSM, and BRFS (P = 0.008, P = 0.001, P = 0.04). Furthermore, the time to nPSA12 was an independent predictor of PCSM and BRFS (P = 0.042, P = 0.021). Pelvic irradiation was also significantly associated with worse OS and PCSM (P = 0.004, P = 0.01). Additionally, age (≤ 70 or > 70 years) and hormone therapy duration (6 months, 1-3 years, or > 3 years) were significantly associated with OS and PCSM, respectively (P = 0.004, P = 0.02). For high risk, nPSA and nPSA12 were an independent predictor for BRFS. (P = 0.021, P = 0.029) CONCLUSION: The nPSA12 level of > 0.06 ng/mL may independently predict worse PCSM and BRFS in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing EBRT and ADT.

There are thousands of genes in genomic studies, while only a limited number of individual samples are available. Therefore, it is important to develop a method to identify genes associated with outcomes of interest that can control finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) in high-dimensional data settings.  Results:   This article proposes a novel method named Grace-AKO for graph-constrained estimation (Grace), which incorporates aggregation of multiple knockoffs (AKO) with the network-constrained penalty. Grace-AKO can control FDR in finite-sample settings and improve model stability simultaneously. Simulation studies show that Grace-AKO has better performance in finite-sample FDR control than the original Grace model. We apply Grace-AKO to the prostate cancer data in The Cancer Genome Atlas program by incorporating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) pathways in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes as the prior information. Grace-AKO finally identifies 47 candidate genes associated with PSA level, and more than 75% of the detected genes can be validated.""","""['Peixin Tian', 'Yiqian Hu', 'Zhonghua Liu', 'Yan Dora Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Knockoff boosted tree for model-free variable selection.', 'CoxMKF: a knockoff filter for high-dimensional mediation analysis with a survival outcome in epigenetic studies.', 'DeepLINK: Deep learning inference using knockoffs with applications to genomics.', 'Empirical extensions of the lasso penalty to reduce the false discovery rate in high-dimensional Cox regression models.', 'Grace is Gone: Directed by James Strouse.']"""

The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®) questionnaire can be used for risk stratification, and our study has demonstrated that the majority of men (91%) in our cohort commencing ADT for prostate cancer were considered low risk for future osteoporotic fracture.  Purpose/introduction:   Long-term use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer patients results in increased bone turnover and decreased bone mineral density (BMD). Proper assessment of any existing osteoporotic fracture risk is crucial prior to starting treatment. However, this risk assessment is poorly performed in these patients in spite of available validated tools including the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX®). The objective of this study was to assess the distribution of osteoporotic fracture risk in a cohort of men commencing ADT for prostate cancer using the FRAX® algorithm.  Methods:   Between July 2020 and May 2022, 200 men filled in the FRAX® questionnaire just before ADT. They were stratified into the high-risk (> 20% probability of a MOF over the next 10 years), intermediate-, and low-risk categories for fragility fractures. We also measured their serum vitamin D and calcium levels.  Results:   The average age was 73.5 years (54-89). It took less than 10 min to complete the assessment. Only six patients were at high-risk, were started on bisphosphonates immediately, and referred for a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. Twelve patients in the intermediate-risk category were referred for DEXA scans for bone mineral density measurements. A total of 182 patients (91%), were in the low-risk category and given lifestyle advice only. All had normal calcium levels but 134 (67%) patients, mostly in the low-risk category, had reduced vitamin D levels (< 50 nmol/L).  Conclusion:   The FRAX® questionnaire is simple and immediately identifies patients who are at risk of fragility fractures. Our study has demonstrated that the majority of men (91%) in our cohort commencing ADT for prostate cancer were considered low risk for future osteoporotic fracture. We were surprised that more than half of our patients had low vitamin D levels.""","""['Abdallah Sharqawi', 'Kathryn Hewitt', 'Cameron Alexander', 'A I El-Sakka', 'L Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Arch Osteoporos""","""['Bone management in Japanese patients with prostate cancer: hormonal therapy leads to an increase in the FRAX score.', 'Comparison of fracture risk assessment tool score to bone mineral density for estimating fracture risk in patients with advanced prostate cancer on androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Performance of FRAX in Men With Prostate Cancer: A Registry-Based Cohort Study.', 'Bone and metabolic health in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Implications of the Fracture Risk Assessment Algorithm for the assessment and improvement of bone health in patients with prostate cancer: A comprehensive review.']"""

T-cell activation is negatively regulated by C-terminal Src kinase (CSK); however, the exact mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that the conserved oncogenic tyrosine kinase Activated CDC42 kinase 1 (ACK1) is able to phosphorylate CSK at Tyrosine 18 (pY18), which enhances CSK function, constraining T-cell activation. Mice deficient in the Tnk2 gene encoding Ack1, are characterized by diminished CSK Y18-phosphorylation and spontaneous activation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, resulting in inhibited growth of transplanted ICB-resistant tumours. Furthermore, ICB treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients results in re-activation of ACK1/pY18-CSK signalling, confirming the involvement of this pathway in ICB insensitivity. An ACK1 small-molecule inhibitor, (R)-9b, recapitulates inhibition of ICB-resistant tumours, which provides evidence for ACK1 enzymatic activity playing a pivotal role in generating ICB resistance.

Saturation of hospitals and the risk of contagion led to a reduction in the care of other diseases.  Objective:   To determine the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on urological surgery in France during the year 2020.  Design, setting and participants:   An observational descriptive study was conducted on anonymised data collected from the national healthcare database established each year as part of the Program for the Medicalization of Information Systems in Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Odontology.  Intervention:   None.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   We gathered the number of urology surgical procedures carried out between 2010 and 2019, and we observed the difference between the forecast and actual number of urological surgeries performed in 2020.  Results:   Urological surgeries decreased by 11.4%, non-oncological surgeries being more affected (-13.1%) than oncological ones (-4.1%). Among the most relevant surgeries, female urinary incontinence (-44.7%) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (-20.8%) were the most impacted ones, followed by kidney cancer (-9%), urolithiasis (-8.7%), radical cystectomy for bladder cancer (-6.1%), prostate cancer (-3.6%) and transurethral resection of bladder tumour (-2%). Public hospitals had a more reduced activity (-17.7%) than private ones (-9.1%). Finally, the distribution of the reduction in urological activities by region did not correspond to the regional burden of SARS-CoV-2.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated data for 146 patients who received DOC followed by CBZ. The correlations of prostate specific antigen (PSA) decrease rate and time to progression between DOC and CBZ treatment were examined. Combined progression-free survival (PFS) of DOC-CBZ and overall survival (OS) from the initiation of DOC and the diagnosis of CRPC were evaluated and compared between patients with high and low PSA levels at the start of DOC and CBZ treatment.  Results:   No correlations of PSA decrease rate and time to progression were observed between DOC and CBZ. The patients for whom DOC was started in higher PSA levels had significantly shorter combined PFS (p = 0.003) and OS from the initiation of DOC (p = 0.002). In patients who started DOC at high PSA levels, those who switched to CBZ at low PSA levels had longer OS than those who switched at high PSA levels (p = 0.048). The OS from CRPC of patients who started DOC at low PSA levels was significantly longer than those that started at high PSA levels (p = 0.030).

Prior research has not examined the relative rates of resumption of high-value and low-value care. We examined the use of 6 common low-value services that received a D grade from the US Preventive Services Task Force compared with clinically comparable high-value services in a large commercially insured population nationwide from before the pandemic to April 1, 2021. We found that, overall, low-value services and high-value services were disrupted similarly. In aggregate, low-value care declined to 56.2% and high-value care to 53.2% in the initial month of the pandemic (April 2020) relative to baseline (number of visits in 2019 normalized by relevant enrolled population), then rebounded to 83.1% of baseline for low-value services and 95.0% of baseline for high-value services by January 2021. Substantial heterogeneity appeared across clinical contexts, such as prostate cancer screening for men 70 years and older rebounding to 111.8% of baseline and asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening remaining at 38.5% of baseline in January 2021. This suggests that although, on average, resuming lower-value services may have been perceived to be a lesser priority by providers and patients, the pandemic may have had heterogeneous effects on consumer and provider decision-making along the dimension of clinical value. This enhances our understanding of how disruptions affect the relationship between clinical value and usage of different services and suggests the need for more targeted interventions to reduce low-value care.""","""['Mahnum Shahzad', 'Zirui Song', 'Michael E Chernew', 'A Mark Fendrick']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Manag Care""","""['Trends in breast and prostate cancer screening and diagnostic procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic in central Massachusetts.', 'Patterns of Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing and Prostate Biopsies During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'What do the screening trials really tell us and where do we go from here?', 'Prostate Cancer Screening and the Associated Controversy.', 'Impacts of COVID-19 on Appropriate Use of Screening Colonoscopy in a Large Integrated Healthcare Delivery System.']"""

In this study, we reported resistance exercise attendance and compliance, and examined if these variables can influence changes in outcomes of interest in men with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 83 prostate cancer patients (age, 68.2 ± 7.0 yr; body mass index, 27.7 ± 3.8 kg·m -2 ) who had undergone 6 months of resistance-based exercise and had data available on exercise training from logbook records were examined. Attendance outcomes such as missed sessions, interruptions and permanent discontinuation, and metrics such as dosage completed (sessions × number of exercises × sets × repetitions × external load), compliance, tolerance, reductions, and escalations were assessed. Outcomes assessed were body composition, physical function, and muscle strength.  Results:   Median resistance exercise attendance was 80.6%, with a median resistance exercise compliance of 88.5% (interquartile range [IQR], 61.1%-107.1%) per participant. A median of 11 (IQR, 1-26) and 0 (IQR, 0-2) sessions were escalated or reduced, respectively.

Participants with higher levels of resistance exercise compliance presented greater improvements in trunk fat mass ( Ptrend = 0.026) and appendicular lean mass ( Ptrend = 0.047).  Conclusions:   A higher resistance exercise compliance led to greater improvements in regional fat and lean mass, whereas physical function and muscle strength improvements were achieved with lower compliance. In addition, patients experienced a high number of dose escalations during the intervention.

Objective:   To evaluate the association of prediagnostic primary care use with metastatic disease at diagnosis and cancer-specific mortality (CSM).  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used databases with primary care and referral linkage from multiple Veterans' Affairs centers from 2004 to 2017 and had a 68-month median follow-up. Analysis was completed between July 2021 and September 2022. Participants included veterans older than 39 years who had been diagnosed with 1 of 12 cancers. Inclusion criteria included known clinical staging, survival follow-up, cause of death, and receiving care at the Veterans Affairs health system (VA).  Exposures:   Prediagnostic PCP use, measured in the 5 years prior to diagnosis. PCP visits were binned into none (0 visits), some (1-4 visits), and annual (5 visits).  Main outcomes and measures:   Metastatic disease at diagnosis, cancer-specific mortality (CSM) for entire cohort and stratified by tumor subtype.  Results:   Among 245 425 patients representing 12 tumor subtypes, mean age was 65.8 (9.3) years, and the cohort skewed male (97.6%), and White (76.1%), with higher levels of comorbidity (58.6% with Charlson Comorbidity Index scores ≥2). Compared with no prior visit, some PCP use was associated with 26% decreased odds of metastatic disease at diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.76; P < .001) and 12% reduced risk of CSM (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 0.88; 95% CI, 0.86-0.89; P < .001). Annual PCP use was associated with 39% decreased odds of metastatic disease (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.59-0.63; P < .001) and 21% reduced risk of CSM (SHR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77-0.81; P < .001). Among tumor subtypes, prostate cancer had the largest effect size for prior PCP use on metastatic disease at diagnosis (OR for annual use, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.30-0.35; P < .001) and CSM (SHRfor annual use, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.48-0.55; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, increased primary care use before cancer diagnosis was associated with significant decreases in metastatic disease at diagnosis and cancer-related death, with potentially the greatest difference from annual use.

To circumvent these challenges, we introduce OncoLoop, a precision medicine framework that predicts drug sensitivity in human tumors and their preexisting high-fidelity (cognate) model(s) by leveraging drug perturbation profiles. As a proof of concept, we applied OncoLoop to prostate cancer using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that recapitulate a broad spectrum of disease states, including castration-resistant, metastatic, and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Interrogation of human prostate cancer cohorts by Master Regulator (MR) conservation analysis revealed that most patients with advanced prostate cancer were represented by at least one cognate GEMM-derived tumor (GEMM-DT). Drugs predicted to invert MR activity in patients and their cognate GEMM-DTs were successfully validated in allograft, syngeneic, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of tumors and metastasis. Furthermore, OncoLoop-predicted drugs enhanced the efficacy of clinically relevant drugs, namely, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the AR inhibitor enzalutamide.  Significance:   OncoLoop is a transcriptomic-based experimental and computational framework that can support rapid-turnaround coclinical studies to identify and validate drugs for individual patients, which can then be readily adapted to clinical practice. This framework should be applicable in many cancer contexts for which appropriate models and drug perturbation data are available.

Recently initiated clinical studies offer a possibility to test whether administration of propranolol inhibits signaling pathways in prostate tumors, however, there is limited information on the dynamics of signaling pathways activated downstream of beta-2 adrenoreceptors in prostate cancer cells and on the inactivation of these pathways upon propranolol administration.  Methods:   Western blot analysis was used to test the effects of epinephrine and propranolol on activation of protein kinase (PKA) signaling in mouse prostates and PKA, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), and protein kinase B/AKT (AKT) signaling in prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   In prostate cancer cell lines epinephrine induced robust phosphorylation of PKA substrates pS133CREB and pS157VASP that was evident 2 min after treatments and lasted for 3-6 h. Epinephrine induced phosphorylation of AKT in PTEN-positive 22Rv1 cells, whereas changes of constitutive AKT phosphorylation were minimal in PTEN-negative PC3, C42, and LNCaP cells. A modest short-term increase of pERK in response to epinephrine was observed in all tested cell lines. Incubation of prostate cancer cells with 10-fold molar excess of propranolol for 30 min inhibited all downstream pathways activated by epinephrine. Subjecting mice to immobilization stress induced phosphorylation of S133CREB, whereas injection of propranolol at 1.5 mg/kg prevented the stress-induced phosphorylation.  Conclusions:   The analysis of pS133CREB and pS157VASP allows measuring activation of PKA signaling downstream of beta-2 adrenoreceptors. Presented results on the ratio of propranolol/epinephrine and the time needed to inhibit signaling downstream of beta-2 adrenoreceptors will help to design clinical studies that examine the effects of propranolol on prostate tumors.""","""['Aljoharah Alaskar', 'Amaal Abdulraqeb Ali', 'Sazzad Hassan', 'Zakia Shinwari', 'Ayodele Alaiya', 'Urs von Holzen', 'Lance Miller', 'George Kulik']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['A pilot study of blood epinephrine levels and CREB phosphorylation in men undergoing prostate biopsies.', 'Stress-induced epinephrine levels compromise murine dermal fibroblast activity through β-adrenoceptors.', 'Regulation of protein kinase B activity by PTEN and SHIP2 in human prostate-derived cell lines.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'ADRB2-Targeting Therapies for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Recent studies did not provide evidence for general side effects of anti-cancer therapy regarding the growth rate of coincident abdominal aortic aneurysms, although it was suggested that specific therapeutic substances might accelerate growth. Aneurysm pathology, however, differs with respect to localization. Hence, we present the first ever analysis on the association of cancer and cancer therapy with growth alteration of aneurysms of the ascending aorta (AscAA). Patients and methods: A retrospective single-center identification of AscAA+cancer patients was performed in the institutional picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Included were all patients with ≥2 CT angiograms over ≥6 months and additional malignancy. Clinical data and aneurysm diameters were retrieved and analyzed for an association of cancer (stratified by tumor entity) or cancer therapy (stratified by several classes of chemotherapeutic agents and radiation therapy) with annual growth rate, respectively. Statistics included t-test, Wilcoxon test, and a linear regression model accounting for initial AscAA diameter and type of treatment. Results: From 2003 to 2021, 151 patients (median age 70 years; 85% male) with AscAA and coincident 163 malignancies were identified. Prostate (37%) and hematologic cancer (17%) were most frequent. One-hundred-eleven patients (74%) received chemotherapy and 75 patients (50%) had radiation. After exclusion of six patients with an initial AscAA diameter >55 mm, the average annual AscAA growth rate was 0.18±0.64 mm/year, with only 12 patients experiencing a growth rate >1mm/year. Neither tumor entity nor radiation or chemotherapy - alone or in combination - were significantly associated with an alteration of the annual AscAA growth rate.

A subset of cancer cells enters the PACC state by polyploidization and acts as cancer stem cells by undergoing depolyploidization and repopulating the tumor cell population after the therapeutic stress is relieved. Our aim was to systematically assess the presence and importance of this entity in men who underwent radical prostatectomy with curative intent to treat their presumed localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Materials and methods:   Men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network intermediate- or high-risk PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy l from 2007 to 2015 and who did not receive neoadjuvant treatment were included. From the cohort of 2159 patients, the analysis focused on a subcohort of 209 patients and 38 cases. Prostate tissue microarrays (TMAs) were prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of the radical prostatectomy specimens. A total of 2807 tissue samples of matched normal/benign and cancer were arrayed in nine TMA blocks. The presence of PACCs and the number of PACCs on each core were noted.  Results:   The total number of cells in the PACC state and the total number of cores with PACCs were significantly correlated with increasing Gleason score (p = 0.0004) and increasing Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Postsurgical (CAPRA-S) (p = 0.004), but no other variables. In univariate proportional hazards models of metastasis-free survival, year of surgery, Gleason score (9-10 vs. 7-8), pathology stage, CAPRA-S, total PACCs, and cores positive for PACCs were all statistically significant. The multivariable models with PACCs that gave the best fit included CAPRA-S. Adding either total PACCs or cores positive for PACCs to CAPRA-S both significantly improved model fit compared to CAPRA-S alone.  Conclusion:   Our findings show that the number of PACCs and the number of cores positive for PACCs are statistically significant prognostic factors for metastasis-free survival, after adjusting for CAPRA-S, in a case-cohort of intermediate- or high-risk men who underwent radical prostatectomy. In addition, despite the small number of men with complete data to evaluate time to metastatic castration-resistant PCa (mCRPC), the total number of PACCs was a statistically significant predictor of mCRPC in univariate analysis and suggested a prognostic effect even after adjusting for CAPRA-S.""","""['Levent Trabzonlu', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Angelo M De Marzo', 'Sarah R Amend']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'Tissue-based Genomics Augments Post-prostatectomy Risk Stratification in a Natural History Cohort of Intermediate- and High-Risk Men.', 'The University of California, San Francisco Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score: a straightforward and reliable preoperative predictor of disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Validity of the CAPRA score to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.

Purpose:   Patients with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are treated with denosumab (DMAB) to prevent fractures and preserve bone mass. We wanted to investigate the change in BMD in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer discontinuing DMAB.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on medical records from patients referred to the Department of Endocrinology from the Department of Urology, Aarhus University Hospital between June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2021. We retrieved information on biochemistry and DXA performed 0-6 months after the last DMAB injection and a second DXA performed approximately 12 months after the first. In case of a BMD T-score ≤ - 1 at the lumbar spine or total hip at the first DXA, the patients were treated with zoledronate. The primary endpoint was change in lumbar spine BMD.  Results:   We included 50 patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer. The mean DMAB treatment duration was 5 ± 0.1 years. Among the patients treated with zoledronate (n = 9), BMD was maintained at the spine and femoral neck after a mean of 16 months.

Background:   Following robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP), a bladder drainage via catheter is necessary to allow for proper healing of the urethrovesical anastomosis. In most cases, this is done using a transurethral foley catheter.1,2 Early traumatic loss of the urethral catheter following RALP is consider a urologic emergency and can lead to vesicourethral anastomotic urine leak, ileus, infection or abscess, and future anastomotic stenosis.3 Replacing the urethral catheter in this situation can be difficult even in experienced hands and often requires imaging assistance.  Method:   A 53-year-old male with Grade Group 4 (Gleason 4 + 4) prostate cancer underwent an uncomplicated RALP. During his post-operative course, his urethral foley catheter fell out or was traumatically removed three times resulting in disruption of the posterior anastomosis. To replace the urethral catheter and prevent it from being dislodged again, a transabdominal approach under ultrasound and cystoscopic guidance was employed to replace the catheter into the bladder and secure it trans abdominally using a single G-tube safety Pexy T fastener.  Conclusion:   This case reports describes a technique used to replace and secure a urethral foley catheter in a patient who suffered from a posterior anastomotic disruption following repeated loss and traumatic removal of his urethral foley catheter during his RALP post-operative course. While replacement of a dislodged urethral foley catheter following a RALP can be challenging, the catheter can safely be placed and secured trans abdominally in these rare but serious situations where the conventional catheter secure devices and patient education alone are not sufficient to prevent removal.""","""['Grace E Prillaman', 'Mei Tuong', 'Clinton T Yeaman', 'Jacques Farhi', 'Kirsten L Greene']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Early removal of urethral catheter with suprapubic tube drainage versus urethral catheter drainage alone after robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of percutaneous suprapubic tube drainage on patient discomfort after radical prostatectomy.', 'New use of foley catheter for exposing the urethral stump during vesicourethral anastomosis in laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'All you need to know about urethrovesical anastomotic urinary leakage following radical prostatectomy.', 'Suprapubic Versus Urethral Catheter for Urinary Drainage After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The interference of metformin with the activity of multi-drug resistance systems in cancer cells has been reported. However, the consequences of the acquired chemoresistance for the adaptative responses of cancer cells to metformin-induced stress and for their phenotypic evolution remain unaddressed.  Methods:   Using a range of phenotypic and metabolic assays, we assessed the sensitivity of human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU145 cells, and their drug-resistant lineages (PC-3_DCX20 and DU145_DCX20), to combined docetaxel/metformin stress. Their adaptation responses have been assessed, in particular the shifts in their metabolic profile and invasiveness.  Results:   Metformin increased the sensitivity of PC-3 wild-type (WT) cells to docetaxel, as illustrated by the attenuation of their motility, proliferation, and viability after the combined drug application. These effects correlated with the accumulation of energy carriers (NAD(P)H and ATP) and with the inactivation of ABC drug transporters in docetaxel/metformin-treated PC-3 WT cells. Both PC-3 WT and PC-3_DCX20 reacted to metformin with the Warburg effect; however, PC-3_DCX20 cells were considerably less susceptible to the cytostatic/misbalancing effects of metformin. Concomitantly, an epithelial-mesenchymal transition and Cx43 upregulation was seen in these cells, but not in other more docetaxel/metformin-sensitive DU145_DCX20 populations. Stronger cytostatic effects of the combined fenofibrate/docetaxel treatment confirmed that the fine-tuning of the balance between energy supply and expenditure determines cellular welfare under metabolic stress.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our data identify the mechanisms that underlie the limited potential of metformin for the chemotherapy of drug-resistant tumors. Metformin can enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy by inducing their metabolic decoupling/imbalance. However, the acquired chemoresistance of cancer cells impairs this effect, facilitates cellular adaptation to metabolic stress, and prompts the invasive front formation.""","""['Jessica Catapano', 'Marcin Luty', 'Tomasz Wróbel', 'Maciej Pudełek', 'Katarzyna Piwowarczyk', 'Sylwia Kędracka-Krok', 'Maciej Siedlar', 'Zbigniew Madeja', 'Jarosław Czyż']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Mol Biol Lett""","""['Metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Expression of AXL enhances docetaxel-resistance of prostate cancer cells.', 'Hyperglycaemia-induced resistance to Docetaxel is negated by metformin: a role for IGFBP-2.', 'Paclitaxel and docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer: Molecular mechanisms and possible therapeutic strategies.', 'Metformin and prostate cancer stem cells: a novel therapeutic target.']"""

Results:   By comparing to that of cfDNA sequencing, the results from DNA sequencing of 1-needle (80%) and mixed 12-needle (77.8%) biopsies are highly comparable.

Anti-androgen-resistant disease (castration-resistant prostate cancer; CRPC) is currently incurable. Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) is positioned to positively regulate both cell cycle and transcription, the two features critical for the rapid proliferation of the CRPC cells. Here, we assess if CDK7 is a viable target to halt the proliferation of CRPC cells.  Methods:   We use recently developed clinically relevant compounds targeting CDK7 and multiple cell proliferation assays to probe the importance of this kinase for the proliferation of normal, androgen-dependent, and CRPC cells. PC patient data were used to evaluate expression of CDK7 at different disease-stages. Finally, comprehensive glycoproteome-profiling was performed to evaluate CDK7 inhibitor effects on androgen-dependent and CRPC cells.  Results:   We show that CDK7 is overexpressed in PC patients with poor prognosis, and that CRPC cells are highly sensitive to compounds targeting CDK7. Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase sensitizes the CRPC, but not androgen-dependent PC cells, to CDK7 inhibitors. Glycoproteome-profiling revealed that CDK7 inhibition induces hyper-O-GlcNAcylation of the positive transcription elongation complex (pTEFB: CDK9 and CCNT1) in the CRPC cells. Accordingly, co-targeting of CDK7 and CDK9 synergistically blocks the proliferation of the CRPC cells but does not have anti-proliferative effects in the normal prostate cells.  Conclusion:   We show that CRPC cells, but not normal prostate cells, are addicted on the high activity of the key transcriptional kinases, CDK7 and CDK9.""","""['Satu Pallasaho', 'Aishwarya Gondane', 'Anni Kuivalainen', 'Samuel Girmay', 'Siver Moestue', 'Massimo Loda', 'Harri M Itkonen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['O-GlcNAc transferase couples MRE11 to transcriptionally active chromatin to suppress DNA damage.', 'Androgen suppresses the proliferation of androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Cdk2, CyclinA, and Skp2.', 'CDK7 Inhibition Suppresses Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer through MED1 Inactivation.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Role of the Androgen-Androgen Receptor Axis in the Treatment Resistance of Advanced Prostate Cancer: From Androgen-Dependent to Castration Resistant and Further.']"""

These regions harbor important oncogenes driving prostate cancer progression, including MYC that plays a role in various hallmarks of cancer, including cell cycle progression and immune surveillance. Herein we characterize the co-expression patterns of chr8q genes and their clinical utility in more than 7,000 radical prostatectomy samples.  Materials and methods:   Copy Number alterations of 336 genes on chr8q21 to chr8q24 were extracted from 2 primary prostate cancer cohorts (TCGA, n = 492; MSK-primary, n = 856) and 3 metastatic prostate cancer cohorts (MSK-met, N = 432; MSK-mCSPC, N = 424; SU2CPNAS, n = 444) from cBioPortal. Expression data for the 336 genes was extracted from 6,135 radical prostatectomy samples from Decipher GRID registry. For survival analysis, patients were grouped into top 10% and top 25% by band expression and were compared with the remaining cohort. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   Genes on chr8q were highly co-amplified and co-expressed. Copy number alterations and overexpression of chr8q genes in primary disease were associated with higher Gleason scores, increased risk of metastases, and increased prostate cancer specific mortality. Additionally, our data demonstrated high expression of MYC alone was not associated with differences in metastases free survival while high expression of other chr8q bands was associated with decreased metastases free survival. By combining chr8q data with an established genomic classifier like Decipher, we were able to develop a new model that was better at predicting metastases than Decipher alone.

In recent years, a ""second generation"" drug called enzalutamide has been used to treat advanced PCa, or patients already exposed to chemotherapy that stopped responding to it.

In our mathematical system, we incorporate cell phenotype switching to model the development of increased drug resistance, and consider the effect of the micro-environment dynamics on necrosis and apoptosis of the tumour cells. The therapeutic strategies that we explore include using a single drug (enzalutamide), and drug combinations (enzalutamide and everolimus or cabazitaxel) with different treatment schedules.

Here we report a novel function of PKCε in regulating of prostate cancer cell proliferation by modulation of PKM2-mediated de novo lipogenesis. We show that PKCε promotes de novo lipogenesis and tumor cell proliferation via upregulation of lipogenic enzymes and lipid contents in prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, PKCε interacts with NABD (1-388) domain of C-terminal deletion on pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2) and enhances the Tyr105 phosphorylation of PKM2, leading to its nuclear localization. Moreover, forced expression of mutant Tyr105 (Y105F) or PKM2 inhibition suppressed de novo lipogenesis and cell proliferation induced by overexpression of PKCε in prostate cancer cells. In a murine tumor model, inhibitor of PKM2 antagonizes lipogenic enzymes expression and prostate cancer growth induced by overexpression of PKCε in vivo.

Segmenting PB is particularly challenging even for clinicians, e.g., from the planning computed tomography (CT) images, as it is an invisible/virtual target after the operative removal of the cancerous prostate gland. Very recently, a few deep learning-based methods have been proposed to automatically contour non-contrast PB by leveraging its spatial reliance on adjacent OARs (i.e., the bladder and rectum) with much more clear boundaries, mimicking the clinical workflow of experienced clinicians. Although achieving state-of-the-art results from both the clinical and technical aspects, these existing methods improperly ignore the gap between the hierarchical feature representations needed for segmenting those fundamentally different clinical targets (i.e., PB and OARs), which in turn limits their delineation accuracy. This paper proposes an asymmetric multi-task network integrating dynamic cross-task representation adaptation (i.e., DyAdapt) for accurate and efficient co-segmentation of PB and OARs in one-pass from CT images. In the learning-to-learn framework, the DyAdapt modules adaptively transfer the hierarchical feature representations from the source task of OARs segmentation to match up with the target (and more challenging) task of PB segmentation, conditioned on the dynamic inter-task associations learned from the learning states of the feed-forward path. On a real-patient dataset, our method led to state-of-the-art results of PB and OARs co-segmentation.

Here, we harnessed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to study tumor phenotypes by ascertaining nucleosome positioning patterns associated with transcription regulation. We sequenced plasma ctDNA whole genomes from patient-derived xenografts representing a spectrum of androgen receptor active (ARPC) and neuroendocrine (NEPC) prostate cancers. Nucleosome patterns associated with transcriptional activity were reflected in ctDNA at regions of genes, promoters, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and accessible chromatin. We identified the activity of key phenotype-defining transcriptional regulators from ctDNA, including AR, ASCL1, HOXB13, HNF4G, and GATA2. To distinguish NEPC and ARPC in patient plasma samples, we developed prediction models that achieved accuracies of 97% for dominant phenotypes and 87% for mixed clinical phenotypes. Although phenotype classification is typically assessed by IHC or transcriptome profiling from tumor biopsies, we demonstrate that ctDNA provides comparable results with diagnostic advantages for precision oncology.  Significance:   This study provides insights into the dynamics of nucleosome positioning and gene regulation associated with cancer phenotypes that can be ascertained from ctDNA. New methods for classification in phenotype mixtures extend the utility of ctDNA beyond assessments of somatic DNA alterations with important implications for molecular classification and precision oncology.

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of motion compensation with a realistic imaging rate for prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). The obtained results will guide optimizing treatment parameters and image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) in tomotherapy using this approach.  Methods:   Ten retrospective prostate cases with actual prostate motion curves previously recorded through the Calypso system were used in this study. Based on the recorded peak-to-peak motion, these cases represented either large (> 5 mm) or median (≤ 5 mm) intra-fractional prostate motions. All the cases were re-planned on tomotherapy using 35 Gy/5 fractions SBRT regimen and three different jaw settings of 1 cm static, 2.5 cm static, and 2.5 cm dynamic jaw. Two motion compensation methods were evaluated: a complete compensation that adjusted the jaw and MLC every 0.1 s (the same rate as the Calypso motion trace), and a realistic compensation that adjusted the jaw and MLC at an average imaging interval of 6 s from sequential monoscopic images. An in-house 4D dose calculation software was then applied to calculate the dosimetric outcomes from the original motion-free plan, the motion-contaminated plan, and the two abovementioned motion-compensated plans. During the process, various imaging rates were also simulated in one case with unusually large motions to quantify the impact of the KV-imaging rate on the effectiveness of motion compensation.  Results:   The effectiveness of motion compensation was evaluated based on the PTV coverage and OAR sparing. Without any motion-compensation, the PTV coverage (PTV V100%) of patients with large prostate motions decreased remarkably to 55%-82% when planning with the 1 cm jaw but to a less level of 67-94% with the 2.5 cm jaw. In contrast, motion compensation improved the PTV coverage (>92%) when combined with the 2.5 cm jaw, but less effective, around 75%-94%, with the 1 cm jaw. For OAR sparing, the bladder D1cc, bladder D10cc, and rectum D1cc all increased in the motion-contaminated plans. Motion compensation improved OAR sparing to the equivalent level of the original motion-free plans. For patients with median prostate motion, motion-induced degradation in PTV coverage was only observed when planning with the 1 cm jaw. After motion compensation, the PTV coverage improved to better than 94% for all three jaw settings. Additionally, the effectiveness of motion compensation depends on the imaging rate. Motion compensation with a typical rate of two KV images per gantry rotation effectively reduces motion-induced dosimetric uncertainties. However, a higher imaging rate is recommended when planning with a 1 cm jaw for patients with large motions.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrated that the performance of sequential monoscopic imaging-guided motion compensation on tomotherapy depends on the amplitude of intra-fractional prostate motion, the plan parameter settings, especially jaw setting, gantry rotation, and the imaging rate for motion compensation.

The aim of this study was to evaluate RTA risk in a population-based cohort of cancer patients living in Southwest Finland.  Patients:   All adult patients diagnosed with cancer in 2013-2019 were included. Acute appendectomy/cholecystectomy and actinic keratosis patients without cancer were selected from the same region as the control cohort. Participants were cross-referenced to a national driving licence database, yielding 12,651 cancer and 6334 control patients with a valid licence. Due to marked differences in their clinical presentation, the cancer cohort was divided into nine cancers of interest (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, melanoma, head & neck, primary brain tumours, gynaecological and haematological malignancies). The nationwide law-regulated motor liability insurance registry was searched for all RTAs leading to injury with claims paid to not- or at-fault participants. At-fault drivers were verified based on sex and birth year.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 34 months, 167 persons were at-fault drivers in RTAs leading to injury. Among the nine cancers of interest, RTA risk did not differ from the control cohort. Among cancer patients, multivariable regression suggested male sex and opioid use, but not advanced cancer stage or given systemic therapy, as the most influential risk factors for RTA.

However, 20%-65% of highly suspicious lesions on mpMRI (PI-RADS [Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System] 4 or 5) are false-positives (FPs), while 5%-10% of clinically significant PC (csPC) are missed. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPRs) are both overexpressed in PC. We therefore aimed to evaluate the potential of 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for biopsy guidance in patients with suspected PC. Methods: A highly selective cohort of 13 men, aged 58.0 ± 7.1 y, with suspected PC (persistently high prostate-specific antigen [PSA] and PSA density) but negative or equivocal mpMRI results or negative biopsy were prospectively enrolled to undergo 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI. PET/MRI included whole-body and dedicated pelvic imaging after a delay of 20 min. All patients had targeted biopsy of any lesions seen on PET followed by standard 12-core biopsy. The SUVmax of suspected PC lesions was collected and compared with gold standard biopsy. Results: PSA and PSA density at enrollment were 9.8 ± 6.0 (range, 1.5-25.5) ng/mL and 0.20 ± 0.18 (range, 0.06-0.68) ng/mL2, respectively. Standardized systematic biopsy revealed a total of 14 PCs in 8 participants: 7 were csPC and 7 were nonclinically significant PC (ncsPC). 68Ga-PSMA11 identified 25 lesions, of which 11 (44%) were true-positive (TP) (5 csPC). 68Ga-RM2 showed 27 lesions, of which 14 (52%) were TP, identifying all 7 csPC and also 7 ncsPC. There were 17 concordant lesions in 11 patients versus 14 discordant lesions in 7 patients between 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET. Incongruent lesions had the highest rate of FP (12 FP vs. 2 TP). SUVmax was significantly higher for TP than FP lesions in delayed pelvic imaging for 68Ga-PSMA11 (6.49 ± 4.14 vs. 4.05 ± 1.55, P = 0.023) but not for whole-body images, nor for 68Ga-RM2. Conclusion: Our results show that 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI are feasible for biopsy guidance in suspected PC.

In this paper, an all-carbon sandwich self-powered biosensor based on graphene and carbon cloth is constructed for the highly sensitive detection of the prostate tumor marker miRNA-141. First, gold nanoparticles modified carbon cloth is applied for substrate electrode, and bilirubin oxidase is then immobilized on it to prepare the biocathode of the biofuel cell. Then, aptamer 1 is immobilized on gold nanoparticles-modified carbon cloth as the electrode substrate. The bioconjugate is prepared by immobilizing the aptamer 2-glucose oxidase complex on gold nanoparticles/graphene. In the biofuel cell-based self-powered sensing system, when the target microRNA-141 is present, it undergoes complementary base pairing with aptamer 1 and aptamer 2, and the bioconjugates are immobilized on the anode to form the sandwich structure. The enzyme on the anode undergoes an oxidation reaction to catalyze the reduction of oxygen, and the electrochemical respond of the system increases significantly. The results show that the concentration of microRNA-141 is proportional to the open-circuit voltage value ranging from 0.0001 to 1000 pmol/L with a detection limit of 50 amol/L (S/N = 3).

Fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenoma is a rare variant that consists of compressed spindle-shaped renal epithelial cells in a fibromyxoid background. Only 14 observations of this variant are reported in the literature. We performed a retrospective analysis of fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenomas from 3 large reference centers. We identified 43 lesions in 6 women and 36 men (2 in 1 man) with a median age of 72 years (range, 31 to 94 y). Median lesion size was 0.7 cm (range, 0.2 to 5 cm). Nephrogenic adenomas were in the bladder (n=15), prostate/prostatic urethra (n=14), kidney (n=7), ureter (n=3), penile urethra (n=3), and urethral diverticulum (n=1). One of the kidney lesions developed in an end-stage kidney and radiologically mimicked cancer. Of 37 patients with information, 36 had predisposing conditions including prior biopsy, transurethral resection of bladder tumor, resection, Foley catheter, BCG treatment, urinary stones, (chemo)radiation, or diverticulum. Only 4/37 (10.8%) had a history of prior irradiation. Fifteen lesions had pure fibromyxoid morphology and 28 were admixed classic and fibromyxoid patterns. Three nephrogenic adenomas involved prostatic stroma, 3 renal sinus fat, 2 muscularis propria (1 bladder, 1 renal pelvis), 1 perinephric fat, and 1 corpus spongiosum. Ten fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenomas were intermixed with urothelial carcinoma, 1 with prostate adenocarcinoma, and 1 with malignant melanoma. By immunohistochemistry, PAX8 was positive in all the examined lesions (n=31). Napsin A was negative in all examined fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenomas (n=30). Twenty of them had classic nephrogenic adenoma component which was positive for napsin A. Similar to classic nephrogenic adenoma, fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenoma can occur anywhere along the urinary tract and is associated with a prior history that causes urothelial injury. In nearly a quarter of the cases, fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenoma extended beyond the lamina propria. Unlike previously suggested, fibromyxoid nephrogenic adenoma is not specifically related to prior radiation therapy.

Illinois residents experience higher rates of cancer death from all 4 cancers compared with the US overall. We developed the Illinois Cancer Risk Index (ICRI), which incorporates many predictors of these cancers into a single summary measure, to identify Illinois counties that would benefit most from public health intervention.  Methods:   We identified 90 county-level predictors of 4 common cancers, used multicollinearity testing to reduce this number to 61, and applied factor analysis to extract and analyze 4 factors representing 25 variables. Next, we created the ICRI by regressing the 4 factors on our outcome of interest - an age-adjusted common cancers mortality rate (CCMR), incorporating the direction of the β-coefficients from regression models to sum factor scores. Finally, we mapped and assessed the geographic distributions of both ICRI and CCMR by county across the state.  Results:   The ICRI was positively associated with the CCMR (r = 0.59, P < .001) and explained 32.2% of the variance in the CCMR across Illinois. The ICRI showed distinct geospatial patterns across the state, with the highest risk counties located in the east-central, far northern, and southern regions. The CCMR showed similar geospatial patterns.  Conclusion:   Our study identifies counties in Illinois that may benefit most from interventions that target multiple cancer risk factors simultaneously. The ICRI may be adapted for use in other geographic locations where data are available.""","""['Lei Guo', 'Margaret E Wright', 'Meredith C Osias', 'Mahdi Vaezi', 'M Courtney Hughes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prev Chronic Dis""","""['Manuscript title: Geospatial analysis of Cancer risk and residential proximity to coal mines in Illinois.', 'Intrastate Variations in Rural Cancer Risk and Incidence: An Illinois Case Study.', 'Trends and Patterns of Disparities in Cancer Mortality Among US Counties, 1980-2014.', 'Kidney Cancer in Rural Illinois: Lower Incidence Yet Higher Mortality Rates.', 'Cancer incidence and age at northern migration of African Americans in Illinois, 1986-1991.', ""Maintaining Our Commitment to Building Scientific Publishing Capacity of Students: PCD's 2022 Student Paper Contest Winners and Release of 2023 Call for Papers.""]"""

Objective:   To investigate responses associated with the combination of avelumab and talazoparib in different tumor types and/or molecular subtypes.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this phase 1b and 2 basket nonrandomized controlled trial, patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled in the following cohorts: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); DNA damage response (DDR)-positive NSCLC; triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC); hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2)-negative, DDR-positive breast cancer; recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (OC); recurrent, platinum-sensitive, BRCA1/2-altered OC; urothelial cancer; metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC); DDR-positive mCRPC; and BRCA1/2- or ATM-altered solid tumors. Data were analyzed between June 17, 2021, and August 6, 2021.  Interventions:   All patients in phases 1b and 2 received avelumab plus talazoparib.  Main outcomes and measures:   The phase 1b primary end point was dose-limiting toxic effects. The phase 2 primary end point was objective response, measured as objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included safety, time to response, duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, time to prostate-specific antigen progression and PSA response of 50% or greater (for mCRPC), cancer antigen 125 response (for OC), pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, and biomarkers.  Results:   A total of 223 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [11.0] years; 117 [52.5%] men) were treated, including 12 patients in phase 1b and 211 patients in phase 2. The recommended phase 2 dose was avelumab 800 mg every 2 weeks plus talazoparib 1 mg once daily. In phase 2, the ORR was 18.2% (95% CI, 5.2%-40.3%) in patients with TNBC; 34.8% (95% CI, 16.4%-57.3%) in patients with HR-positive, ERBB2-negative, and DDR-positive BC; and 63.6% (95% CI, 30.8%-89.1%) in patients with platinum-sensitive, BRCA1/2-altered OC. Responses occurred more frequently in patients with BRCA1/2-altered tumors. Durable responses were observed in patients with TNBC (median [range] DOR, 11.1 [3.4-20.4] months); HR-positive, ERBB2-negative, and DDR-positive BC (median [range] DOR, 15.7 [3.9 to ≥20.6] months); and BRCA1/2-altered OC (median DOR not reached; range, 5.6 to ≥18.4 months). The most common grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events were anemia (75 patients [33.6%]), thrombocytopenia (48 patients [21.5%]), and neutropenia (31 patients [13.9%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   This nonrandomized controlled trial found that ORRs for avelumab plus talazoparib were comparable with those with PARP inhibitor or ICI monotherapy. Prolonged DOR in patients with TNBC; HR-positive, ERBB2-negative, and DDR-positive BC; and BRCA1/2-altered OC warrant further investigation in randomized clinical trials.

Although tumor-associated macrophages are involved in tumor malignancy, the interactions between circRNAs and tumor-associated macrophages in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unclear. In the present study, we found that hsa_circ_0094606 (subsequently named circ_0094606) could promote proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as migration of PCa cells through cell viability and migration assays and the determination of EMT markers. Mass spectrometry analysis after RNA pull-down experiment identified that circ_0094606 bound to protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in PCa cells, and further functional assays revealed that circ_0094606 promoted the malignant progression of PCa by binding to PRMT1.

The current approach to generate preclinical models for immunotherapy evaluation has been to transplant CD34+ cells from umbilical cord blood into immune-deficient mice followed by implantation of patient derived tumor cells. However, current models are associated with high tumor rejection rate secondary to the allograft vs. tumor response from human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatches. We herein report the first development of a novel, humanized patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model using autologous CD34+ cells from bone marrow aspirate obtained from a patient with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) from whom a PDX had been developed.  Case description:   This is a 68-year-old Caucasian man diagnosed with mRCC with metastasis to the liver in 2014. He was treated with sunitinib +/- AGS-003 and underwent a cytoreductive right nephrectomy, left adrenalectomy and partial liver resection. PDX was generated using resected nephrectomy specimen. After surgery, patient received multiple lines of standard of care therapy including sunitinib, axitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus and cabozantinib. While progressing on cabozantinib, he was treated with nivolumab. Seven years after initiation of nivolumab, and 4 years after stopping systemic therapy, he remains in complete remission. To generate autologous PDX model, bone marrow aspirate was performed and CD34+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) were isolated and injected into 150 rad irradiated non-obese diabetic scid gamma null (NSG) mice. At 11 weeks post-transplant, the matched patient PDX was injected subcutaneously into the humanized mice and the mice were treated with nivolumab.  Conclusions:   Our case represents successful therapy of nivolumab in mRCC. Furthermore, HPSCs obtained from a single bone marrow aspirate were able to reconstitute an immune system in the mice that allowed nivolumab to inhibit the tumor growth of PDX and recapitulated the durable remission observed in the patient with nivolumab. We observed the reconstitution of human T cells, B cells and natural killer (NK) cells and unlike the humanized mouse model using cord blood, our model system eliminates the tumor rejection from mis-matched HLA. Our autologous humanized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) PDX model provides an effective tool to study immunotherapy in a preclinical setting.""","""['Yubin Kang#', 'Andrew J Armstrong#', 'David S Hsu#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Stem Cell Investig""","""['Characterization of immune responses to anti-PD-1 mono and combination immunotherapy in hematopoietic humanized mice implanted with tumor xenografts.', 'An Improved Patient-Derived Xenograft Humanized Mouse Model for Evaluation of Lung Cancer Immune Responses.', 'Evaluation of anti-PD-1-based therapy against triple-negative breast cancer patient-derived xenograft tumors engrafted in humanized mouse models.', 'Application of Highly Immunocompromised Mice for the Establishment of Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) Models.', 'Axitinib, cabozantinib, everolimus, nivolumab, sunitinib and best supportive care in previously treated renal cell carcinoma: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Patient-derived xenografts or organoids in the discovery of traditional and self-assembled drug for tumor immunotherapy.']"""

Growing evidence substantiates the important role of immunotherapy in human tumors. Given that immunotherapy is often unsatisfactory on PCa, many studies have been conducted on PCa immunotherapy to improve treatment efficacy. However, no relevant bibliometric study of PCa immunotherapy has hitherto been reported. A bibliometric analysis was performed to evaluate the global scientific production of PCa immunotherapy research and characterize the development trends for future studies in this article.  Methods:   The publications related to PCa immunotherapy were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection. The contribution and co-occurrence relationships of countries/regions, institutions, journals, references, authors, and keywords were assessed and visualized by VOSviewer and CiteSpace to identify research hotspots and potential future trends.  Results:   A total of 3,583 publications related to PCa immunotherapy from 1999 to 2021 were collected. The results of annual publications and citations exhibited a steady increase over the past 22 years. The National Cancer Institute in the USA published far more papers during the study than any institute. Accordingly, the USA had the most publications (n = 1,954, 54.54%). Gulley, James L. had the most number of published papers, and Small, Eric J. was the most co-cited authors in this field. Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy was the most productive journal, with 145 publications on PCa immunotherapy. Keyword cluster and keyword burst analyses showed that research in PCa immunotherapy shifted from ""t cell infiltration"" and ""sipuleucel t"" to ""immune checkpoint inhibitor"", ""CTLA-4"", and ""PD-L1 expression"".  Conclusion:   PCa immunotherapy has attracted much attention, reflected by the increasing number of annual publications and citations. Much emphasis has been placed on exploring the complex immunogenicity and tumor microenvironment for PCa and identifying the patient population who can benefit from immunotherapy. Combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with other therapeutic options and cancer vaccines represents the future development trends in PCa immunotherapy.""","""['Weibo Zhong', 'Zefeng Shen', 'Yongxin Wu', 'Xiangming Mao', 'Jianqiu Kong', 'Weixia Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Emerging trends and research foci of oncolytic virotherapy for central nervous system tumors: A bibliometric study.', 'Knowledge Mapping of Immunotherapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Bibliometric Study.', 'Research trends on anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy for esophageal cancer: A bibliometric analysis.', 'Bibliometric analysis of global research trends on male osteoporosis: a neglected field deserves more attention.', 'Bibliometric and visualized analysis of ocular drug delivery from 2001 to 2020.', 'Cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs): potential, mechanisms of resistance, and strategies for reinvigorating T cell responsiveness when resistance is acquired.', 'Bibliometric evaluation of 2020-2022 publications on COVID-19-related cardiovascular disease.']"""

Among metastatic organs, bone is the most common metastatic site, with more than 90% of advanced patients developing bone metastases (BMs) before 24 months of death. Although patients were recommended to use bone-targeted drugs represented by bisphosphonates to treat BMs of CRPC, there was no significant improvement in patient survival. In addition, the use of immunotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy is limited due to the immunosuppressed state and resistance to antiandrogen agents in patients with bone metastases. Therefore, it is still essential to develop a safe and effective therapeutic schedule for CRPC patients with BMs. To this end, we propose a multiplex drug repurposing scheme targeting differences in patient immune cell composition. The identified drug candidates were ranked from the perspective of M2 macrophages by integrating transcriptome and network-based analysis. Meanwhile, computational chemistry and clinical trials were used to generate a comprehensive drug candidate list for the BMs of CRPC by drug redundancy structure filtering. In addition to docetaxel, which has been approved for clinical trials, the list includes norethindrone, testosterone, menthol and foretinib. This study provides a new scheme for BMs of CRPC from the perspective of M2 macrophages. It is undeniable that this multiplex drug repurposing scheme specifically for immune cell-related bone metastases can be used for drug screening of any immune-related disease, helping clinicians find promising therapeutic schedules more quickly, and providing reference information for drug R&D and clinical trials.""","""['Jinyuan Chang', 'Zhenglong Jiang', 'Tianyu Ma', 'Jie Li', 'Jiayang Chen', 'Peizhi Ye', 'Li Feng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Many studies have reported the association between periodontal disease and various cancers including oral cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and so on. However, there is still no specialized meta-analysis that assesses the association between periodontal disease and cancer incidence and mortality in-deepth. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis.  Methods:   This meta-analysis was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020183497. We searched five online databases for observational studies about the association between periodontal disease and breast, prostate, lung and bronchial, colorectal, and total cancers by July 2020. Then we evaluated quality of the included studies by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Risk ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled to evaluate the strength of the association between periodontal disease and four cancers, total cancer incidence and mortality. In addition, we analyzed heterogeneity by subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis. Finally, we inspected publication bias by Begg's and Egger's tests.  Results:   None of the studies included in this meta-analysis were of poor quality. PD is not only related to breast cancer incidence (HR = 1.26,95%CI [1.11-1.43], I 2 = 75.8%, P = 0.000), but also connected with total cancer mortality (HR = 1.40,95%CI [1.24-1.58], I 2 = 0.0%, P = 0.718). Subgroup analyses showed that study population, study design, dental status, follow-up period, adjustment for smoking partially explained the heterogeneity between studies. The results of Begg's test and Egger's test were consistent and indicated that there is no publication bias in this study.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed a positive relationship between periodontal disease and breast cancer incidence and total cancer mortality. Further well-designed studies with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are required to strengthen the conclusion of this meta-analysis.

The aim of the study was to investigate and elucidate the molecular mechanistic of GPC1 in human EGAC.  Methods:   Thirty tissue and 120 microarray sections of EGAC were evaluated with Anti-GPC1 immunohistochemistry. Loss and gain of GPC1 function were performed using lentivirus transfection in EGAC cell lines. Mechanistically, AKT/GSK/β-catenin pathway was evaluated using AKT inhibitor MK-2206 and Wnt/β-catenin stimulant LiCl.  Results:   GPC1 overexpression was found in 102 cases (68%). Overexpression of GPC1 correlated with lymph node metastasis, poor differentiation and decreased overall survival. Lentivirus mediated GPC1 knockdown resulted in decreased cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and colony formation. Knockdown caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis, and reduced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). GPC1 mediated its effects by activation of AKT/GSK/β-catenin pathway.

The key component of mTORC2 is highly expressed in docetaxel-resistant prostate cells. However, the underlying molecular effects on prostate cells remain unclear.  Methods:   A docetaxel-resistant human prostate cell line (PC-3/DTX) was constructed to investigate the role of mTORC2 in docetaxel resistance. The lentivirus was transfected into cells to knock down the expression of Rictor, and cell viability was measured by Cell Counting Kit 8 (CCK-8). Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle, and the changes in related signal cascades were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and Western blot.  Results:   Docetaxel showed the lowest IC50 (50% inhibitory concentration) in PC-3/DTX cells with sh-RNA. Decreased Rictor expression resulted in a larger proportion of arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase in PC-3/DTX cells. The IC50 values of the AZD8055 group were lower than in the Rapamycin group when treated with docetaxel again. Furthermore, a larger proportion of PC-3/DTX cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase in the AZD8055 group compared to the Rapamycin group. The IHC results of the prostate cancer tissues from a CRPC patient revealed the over expression of Rictor only, while Raptor expression was unaffected.  Conclusion:   We investigated the role of mTORC2 signaling on the acquired docetaxel -resistant PC-3 cells to identify potential methods for clinical treatment. MTORC2 expression is essential for docetaxel drug resistance of PC-3 cells. The mTORC1/2 inhibitor AZD8055 caused more significant disruption of mTORC2 kinase activity than the mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin, which lead to decreased docetaxel-mediated resistance. Therefore, reversing docetaxel resistance, may become a therapeutic option in the treatment of mCRPC patients.""","""['Yujie Huang', 'You Zhai', 'Meijia Wu', 'Chengdong Chang', 'Jindan Luo', 'Dongsheng Hong', 'Qingwei Zhao', 'Yao Dai', 'Jian Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Drug Des Devel Ther""","""['Impact of dual mTORC1/2 mTOR kinase inhibitor AZD8055 on acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer in vitro.', 'Differential roles and activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complexes 1 and 2 during cell migration in prostate cancer cells.', 'Receptor-recognized α₂-macroglobulin binds to cell surface-associated GRP78 and activates mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeted Inhibition of Rictor/mTORC2 in Cancer Treatment: A New Era after Rapamycin.', 'Disentangling the signaling pathways of mTOR complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, as a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.']"""

Among these, mono- and di-carboxylic 3,4-dihydroquinoxalin-2(1H)-one derivatives arose as promising candidate sGC activators. A series of such compounds was synthesized and assessed for their effect on sGC activity.

In this study, the effect of the first year of COVID-19 was determined on cancer diagnoses in the province of Quebec, Canada.  Methods:   Data were collected from the 13 Quebec Cancer Registry health institutions. Newly diagnosed cancer declarations in the first year of the COVID-19 (April 2020-March 2021) were compared with the reference periods (averages of 3 previous years). The main focus was on four leading cancers: lung, prostate, colorectal, and breast cancers. Generalized regression models with a poisson approximation and interrupted time series (ITS) analysis were used. Underestimated cases were presented in terms of relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The changes in the stage-specific counts were also assessed in each of the four cancers. Results were illustrated separately for the first 4 months of the pandemic (first wave).  Findings:   This study estimated an overall under-reporting of 15.3% (29,019 vs. 24,584) of declarations. This under-reporting was evident across all age groups above 35 years (p < 0.0001), four primary cancers (p < 0.0001), all stages of cancers (p < 0.0001), and both sexes (p < 0.0001). Based on the relative risks, stage-specific lung cancer counts were underestimated by 5%-34% in the first wave (0%-11% in the first year), prostate cancer by 16%-46% in the first wave (0%-25% in the first year), colorectal cancer 15%-45% in the first wave (0%-24% in the first year), and breast cancer 3%-45% in the first wave and (0%-28% in the first year). However, no stage-IV cancers were statically under-reported compared to the pre-pandemic era and not even in the first wave.  Interpretation:   Cancer diagnosis was underestimated due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the first year; this effect was more evident in the first phase of the pandemic in Quebec. Further research is required to determine the accurate burden of the disease in the long term.""","""['Agnihotram V Ramanakumar', 'Bourassa Annie', 'Lamonde Frederic', 'Bertrand Christine', 'Rouleau Cathy', 'Latreille Jean']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer stage at diagnosis according to race.', 'Impact of COVID-19-related health care disruptions on pathologic cancer staging during the first pandemic year: a retrospective cohort study from March 2018 to March 2021.', 'Impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on female breast, colorectal and non-small\xa0cell lung cancer incidence, stage and healthcare pathway to diagnosis during 2020 in Wales, UK, using a national cancer clinical record system.', 'A systematic review of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer screening and diagnosis.', 'How Can Health Systems Better Prepare for the Next Pandemic?

This study aimed to modify the AJCC 8th staging system in patients with advanced prostate cancer.  Methods:   Data of patients with advanced prostate cancer from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2016 were enrolled in this cohort study. All patients were divided into the training set and the testing set with a ratio of 6:4. Multivariate Cox survival model was utilized to obtain the nomogram score for each stage variable. The modified staging system was based on the total nomogram score. The C-index and Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves were used to show the prognostic prediction effect of patients with different staging systems.  Results:   A total of 28,006 patients were included for analysis. T stage, N stage, M stage, primary Gleason pattern score, secondary Gleason pattern score, and PSA level were included as stage variables. Patients with AJCC stage III C [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.17, 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.39-5.13] and AJCC stage IV B (HR = 3.19, 95%CI, 1.79-5.69) were associated with worse prognosis compared with those of AJCC stage III B, while no statistical significance was found in patients with stage IV A (P > 0.05). In terms of the modified staging system, patients with modified stage III C (HR = 2.06, 95%CI, 1.46-2.92), modified stage IV A (HR = 6.91, 95%CI, 4.81-9.94), and modified stage IV B (HR = 21.89, 95%CI, 14.76-32.46) were associated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients with modified stage III B. The prognostic ability (C-index) of the modified staging system (0.789; 95%CI, 0.777-0.801) was better than that of the AJCC 8th edition system (0.762; 95%CI, 0.748-0.776) (0.789 vs. 0.762, P = 0.004). The K-M curves indicated that the modified staging system may be distinguished prognostic differences in patients with different stages.

Growing evidence has shown that docosahexaenoic acid has anti-inflammatory and chemopreventive abilities. Studies have shown that autophagy inhibition and ferroptosis are promising therapeutic strategies for overcoming multidrug resistance. This study was aimed to examine whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could reverse docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer cells. Cell survival was examined by MTT and colony formation. Protein expression was determined by Western blot. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was measured by flow cytometry. DHA displayed anti-cancer effects on proliferation, colony formation, migration, apoptosis, autophagy and epithelial mesenchymal transition. Glutathione-S-transferase π is an enzyme that plays an important role in drug resistance. DHA inhibited GSTπ protein expression and induced cytoprotective autophagy by regulating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway in PC3R cells. DHA combined with PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) enhanced apoptosis by alleviating the expression of LC3B, (pro-) caspase- 3 and (uncleaved) PARP. DHA induced ferroptosis by attenuating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). DHA-treated PC3R cells produced ROS. The ROS and cytotoxicity were reversed by treatment with ferrostatin-1. DHA combined with docetaxel inhibited EMT by regulating the expression of E-cadhein and N-cadherin. In summary, DHA reversed drug resistance and induced cytoprotective autophagy and ferroptosis by regulating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/GPX4 signalling pathway in PC3R cells. We propose that DHA could be developed as a chemosensitizer and that the PI3K/AKT /Nrf2/GPX4 signalling pathway might be a promising therapeutic target for overcoming cancer drug resistance.""","""['Z C Shao', 'B H Zhu', 'A F Huang', 'M Q Su', 'L J An', 'Z P Wu', 'Y J Jiang', 'H Guo', 'X-Q Han', 'C-M Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Folia Biol (Praha)""","""['Docosahexaenoic acid increases the expression of oxidative stress-induced growth inhibitor 1 through the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.', 'Wogonoside reverses cisplatin resistance in SGC7901/cDDP cells through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2/ARE signaling pathway.', 'The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid inhibits proliferation and progression of non-small cell lung cancer cells through the reactive oxygen species-mediated inactivation of the PI3K /Akt pathway.', 'INPP4B reverses docetaxel resistance and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway alleviates ovarian cancer chemoresistance through reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and decreasing cancer stem cell marker expression.', 'The Involvement of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Apoptosis Mechanisms and Their Implications in Cancer.', 'The Potential of DHA as Cancer Therapy Strategies: A Narrative Review of In Vitro Cytotoxicity Trials.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) were eligible. Treatment consisted of a single 15 Gy MRI-guided HDR-BT followed by external beam radiotherapy (37.5-46 Gy depending on their risk category). Dosimetry, toxicity and HRQoL outcomes were collected prospectively at baseline, 1 and 3 months using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.0 and the expanded PCa index composite, respectively. General linear mixed modeling was conducted to assess the changes in expanded PCa index composite domain scores over time. A minimally important difference was defined as a deterioration of HRQoL scores at 3 months compared to baseline ≥ 0.5 standard deviation. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Sixty-one patients were included. Acute grade (G)2 urinary toxicity was observed in 18 (30%) patients while 1 (2%) patient had G3 toxicity, and none had G4 toxicity.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed EOL care for decedents with mRCC in two parallel cohorts: (1) patients (RCC diagnosed 2004-2015) from the University of North Carolina's Cancer Information and Population Health Resource (CIPHR) and (2) patients (diagnosed 2007-2015) from SEER-Medicare. We assessed hospice use in the last 30 days of life and existing measures of poor-quality EOL care: systemic therapy, hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, and > 1 ED visit in the last 30 days of life; hospice initiation in the last 3 days of life; and in-hospital death. Associations between OAA use, patient and provider characteristics, and EOL care were examined using multivariable logistic regression.  Results:   We identified 410 decedents in the CIPHR cohort (53.4% received OAA) and 1,508 in SEER-Medicare (43.5% received OAA).

Objective:   To evaluate the utilization and costs of care cascades of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests for prostate cancer screening, as the routine use of which among asymptomatic men aged 70 years and older is discouraged by multiple guidelines.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study included men aged 70 years and older without preexisting prostate conditions enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan during January 2016 to December 2018 with at least 1 outpatient visit. Medical billing claims data from the deidentified OptumLabs Data Warehouse were used. Data analysis was conducted from September 2020 to August 2021.  Exposures:   At least 1 claim for low-value PSA tests for prostate cancer screening during the observation period.  Main outcomes and measures:   Utilization of and spending on low-value PSA cancer screening and associated care cascades and the difference in overall health care utilization and spending among individuals receiving low-value PSA cancer screening vs those who did not, adjusting for observed characteristics using inverse probability of treatment weighting.  Results:   Of 995 442 men (mean [SD] age, 78.0 [5.6] years) aged 70 years or older in a Medicare Advantage plan included in this study, 384 058 (38.6%) received a low-value PSA cancer screening.

Among those receiving initial low-value PSA cancer screening, 241 188 of 384 058 (62.8%) received at least 1 follow-up service. Repeated PSA testing was the most common, and 27 268 (7.1%) incurred high-cost follow-up services, such as imaging, radiation therapy, and prostatectomy. Utilization and spending associated with care cascades also increased from 2016 to 2018. For every $1 spent on a low-value PSA cancer screening, an additional $6 was spent on care cascades. Despite avoidable care cascades, individuals who received low-value PSA cancer screening were not associated with increased overall health care utilization and spending during the 1-year follow-up period compared with an unscreened population.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cross-sectional study, low-value PSA tests for prostate cancer screening remained prevalent among Medicare Advantage plan enrollees and were associated with unnecessary expenditures due to avoidable care cascades.

Here we report that inhibitors of the mitotic regulator polo-like kinase-1 (Plk1), including the clinically active third-generation Plk1 inhibitor onvansertib, synergizes with abiraterone in vitro and in vivo to kill a subset of cancer cells from a wide variety of tumor types in an androgen-independent manner. Gene-expression analysis identified an AR-independent synergy-specific gene set signature upregulated upon abiraterone treatment that is dominated by pathways related to mitosis and the mitotic spindle. Abiraterone treatment alone caused defects in mitotic spindle orientation, failure of complete chromosome condensation, and improper cell division independently of its effects on AR signaling. These effects, although mild following abiraterone monotherapy, resulted in profound sensitization to the antimitotic effects of Plk1 inhibition, leading to spindle assembly checkpoint-dependent mitotic cancer cell death and entosis. In a murine patient-derived xenograft model of abiraterone-resistant metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), combined onvansertib and abiraterone resulted in enhanced mitotic arrest and dramatic inhibition of tumor cell growth compared with either agent alone. Overall, this work establishes a mechanistic basis for the phase II clinical trial (NCT03414034) testing combined onvansertib and abiraterone in mCRPC patients and indicates this combination may have broad utility for cancer treatment.

We aimed to compare the [18F]fluciclovine and [18F]fluorocholine PET/CT detection rate (DR) in PCa patients restaged for early biochemical recurrence (BCR), according to clinical and biochemical features. A cohort of 138 PCa patients with early BCR (mean age: 71 y, range: 50-87 y) were homogeneously randomized 1:1 to a [18F]fluciclovine or a [18F]fluorocholine PET/CT group. The respective PET/CT DR, according to per-patient and per-region analysis, and the impact of the biochemical, clinical, and histological parameters, were compared. The PSA cut-off values predictive of a positive scan were also calculated. Overall, the [18F]fluciclovine PET/CT DR was 64%, significantly higher than the [18F]fluorocholine PET/CT DR of 35% (p = 0.001). Similarly, in the per-region analysis, the [18F]fluciclovine PET/CT DR was 51% in the prostate region, significantly higher compared to 15% of [18F]fluorocholine (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, a statistically significant higher DR in per-patient and per-region (prostate/prostate bed) analysis was observed in the [18F]fluciclovine group for 0.5-1 ng/mL (p = 0.018, p = 0.049) and >1 ng/mL (p = 0.040, p < 0.0001) PSA values. A PSA of 0.45 ng/mL for [18F]fluciclovine and of 0.94 ng/mL for [18F]fluorocholine was identified as the optimal cut-off value in predicting a positive PET/CT scan. Our results demonstrated a better [18F]fluciclovine PET/CT DR compared to [18F]fluorocholine for restaging PCa patients in early BCR, particularly in the detection of locoregional recurrence. The significantly higher [18F]fluciclovine DR for low PSA values (PSA < 1 ng/mL) supports its use in this setting of patients.""","""['Cristina Ferrari', 'Paolo Mammucci', 'Valentina Lavelli', 'Antonio Rosario Pisani', 'Anna Giulia Nappi', 'Dino Rubini', 'Angela Sardaro', 'Giuseppe Rubini']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Tomography""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '18F-fluciclovine PET-CT and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT in patients with early biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy: a prospective, single-centre, single-arm, comparative imaging trial.', 'Effect of hormonal therapy on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT in the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, localization of metastatic disease, and correlation with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Acquisition with (11)C-choline and (18)F-fluorocholine PET/CT for patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.']"""

Then, Lasso and COX regression was used to develop the ARGPI. We performed the whole analyses through R packages (version 3.6.3). Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1), single-minded 2 (SIM2), serine protease inhibitor b5 (SERPINB5), aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), and acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain 3 (ACSL3) were eventually used to establish the ARGPI score. Patients were divided into two different-risk groups based on the median ARGPI score, high-risk patients with a higher risk of BCR than low-risk patients (hazard ratio [HR]: 5.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.23-9.24). The risk of metastasis of high-risk patients was higher than low-risk patients (HR: 11.31, 95% CI: 4.89-26.12). In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, we observed similar prognostic value of ARGPI in terms of BCR-free survival (HR: 1.79, 95% CI: 1.07-2.99) and metastasis-free survival (HR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.16-2.78). ARGPI score showed a diagnostic accuracy of 0.703 for drug resistance. Analysis of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated that patients in the high-risk group were significantly positively related to interleukin (IL)-18 signaling pathway. Moreover, ARGPI score was significantly related to cancer-related fibroblasts (CAFs; r = 0.36), macrophages (r = 0.28), stromal score (r = 0.38), immune score (r = 0.35), estimate score (r = 0.39), as well as tumor purity (r = -0.39; all P < 0.05).

With the gradually recognized value of bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (bpMRI) in PCa, it is beneficial to noninvasively predict GGs from bpMRI for early diagnosis and treatment planning of PCa. However, it is challenging to establish the connection between bpMRI features and GGs.  Purpose:   In this study, we propose a dual attention-guided multiscale neural network (DAMS-Net) to predict the 5-scored GG from bpMRI and design a training curriculum to further improve the prediction performance.  Methods:   The proposed DAMS-Net incorporates a feature pyramid network (FPN) to fully extract the multiscale features for lesions of varying sizes and a dual attention module to focus on lesion and surrounding regions while avoiding the influence of irrelevant ones. Furthermore, to enhance the differential ability for lesions with the inter-grade similarity and intra-grade variation in bpMRI, the training process employs a specially designed curriculum based on the differences between the radiological evaluations and the ground truth GGs.  Results:   Extensive experiments were conducted on a private dataset of 382 patients and the public PROSTATEx-2 dataset. For the private dataset, the experimental results showed that the proposed network performed better than the plain baseline model for GG prediction, achieving a mean quadratic weighted Kappa (Kw ) of 0.4902 and a mean positive predictive value of 0.9098 for predicting clinically significant cancer (PPVGG>1 ). With the application of curriculum learning, the mean Kw and PPVGG>1 further increased to 0.5144 and 0.9118, respectively. For the public dataset, the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art results of 0.5413 Kw and 0.9747 PPVGG>1 .

Here, we show that, of a panel of fatty acids tested, arachidonic acid and its specific metabolite 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) regulate androgen metabolism. Arachidonic acid is metabolized to 5-HETE and reduces androgens by inducing aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family members AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 expression in human prostate, breast, and lung epithelial cells.

Mechanistically, we show that hsa_circ_0070512 acts as a ""molecular sponge"" for miR-338-3p and that the miR-338-3p mimics partially block the pro-tumor effects of hsa_circ_0070512. RNA sequencing analysis of PC3 cells stably overexpressing hsa_circ_0070512 revealed that hedgehog was downstream of the signaling pathways of hsa_circ_0070512 and miR-338-3p. Our results implied that hsa_circ_0070512 regulated the hedgehog signaling pathways through miR-338-3p to enhance PCa growth and migration, providing a new diagnostic and therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Pingxin Zhang', 'Hang Gao', 'Ruping Yan', 'Lu Yu', 'Chengxing Xia', 'Delin Yang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Hsa_circ_0102485 inhibits the growth of cancer cells by regulating the miR-188-3p/ARID5B/AR axis in prostate carcinoma.', 'Hsa_circ_0003258 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by complexing with IGF2BP3 and sponging miR-653-5p.', 'Hsa_circ_0030586 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer via PI3K-AKT signaling.', 'Hsa_circ_0053063 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation via hsa_circ_0053063/hsa-miR-330-3p/PDCD4 axis.', 'CircRNA hsa_circ_0014130 function as a miR-132-3p sponge for playing oncogenic roles in bladder cancer via upregulating KCNJ12 expression.']"""

The study aimed to investigate the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) between populations with and without cancer.  Methods:   Patients with common cancers in Taiwan were enrolled in the study between 2007 and 2018 using the Taiwan Cancer Registry. We focused on colorectal cancer, women's breast cancer, lung cancer, liver cancer, oral cancer, prostate cancer, and thyroid cancers. The study endpoint was fatal and non-fatal CVD, which was defined as ischemic heart disease and ischemic stroke according to the National Health Insurance Research Database. We compared the risk of CVD between patients with cancer and age- and sex-matched (1:1 ratio) participants who did not have cancer or CVD. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from Cox regression analysis. To evaluate the chronological trend, we estimated the HRs and 95% CI yearly since the diagnosis.  Results:   Among the 552,485 cancer patients (mean age, 60.6 years; women, 47.7%) during the median follow-up period of 4.1 years, 32,634 cases of fatal and non-fatal CVD were identified. Compared with that noted in the non-cancer population, the overall fully adjusted HR with 95% CI was 1.28 (1.25, 1.30) in the cancer population. The CVD risk was the highest in the first year, the adjusted HR with 95% CI was 2.31 (2.23, 2.40), and this risk decreased yearly.

Although nurses are uniquely positioned to deliver effective and efficient nurse-led survivorship care, they report that their experiences of survivorship care provision are fragmented, under-resourced, and often distressing for the patient.  Data sources:   Here we report the culmination of a 4-year program of research and more than a decade of nurse-led work, to improve the survivorship care experience for men with prostate cancer comprising of: (1) the evolution of a national specialist prostate cancer nursing service; (2) a nursing Delphi study to determine prostate cancer survivorship care experiences and priorities; (3) the development of the Prostate Cancer Survivorship Essentials Framework, which provides a road map for improving quality prostate cancer survivorship care across a variety of settings; and (4) the translation of the framework into nursing practice through the development of My Personal Plan, a person-centered, evidence-informed survivorship care plan.  Conclusion:   Through the leadership of a national prostate cancer specialist nursing service, the provision of a coordinated, evidence-informed person-centered survivorship care service is now achievable. This program of work has demonstrated that irrespective of the setting or mode of delivery, specialist nurses involved in the care of men with prostate cancer and their families are leading best practice through the translation of evidence into everyday clinical practice.  Implications for nursing practice:   There is an urgent need to address the significant challenges that a prostate cancer diagnosis can bring, and nurses are at the forefront and lead survivorship care delivery, which includes: (1) routine distress screening and referral to tailored evidence-based psychological care; (2) the provision of person-centered care that connects to effective symptom management; (3) self-management support; and (4) signposting to additional services which extend beyond the acute care setting.""","""['Sally A M Sara', 'Suzanne K Chambers', 'Russell Briggs', 'Nicole Heneka', 'Jeff Dunn']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Semin Oncol Nurs""","""['Prostate cancer survivorship priorities for men and their partners: Delphi consensus from a nurse specialist cohort.', 'Working patterns and perceived contribution of prostate cancer clinical nurse specialists: a mixed method investigation.', 'Provision of survivorship care for patients with haematological malignancy at completion of treatment: A cancer nursing practice survey study.', 'An exploration of the Role of the Prostate Cancer Specialist Nurse from Two International Perspectives.', 'Experiences of gynecological cancer patients receiving care from specialist nurses: a qualitative systematic review.']"""

Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been identified as promising candidates to simultaneously improve both radiotherapy and imaging, thereby improving both the accuracy and safety of IGRT.

Details of chondrocyte metabolism and how it rewires during the progression of osteoarthritis (OA) are unknown. This research aims to identify what changes in the energy metabolic state occur in OA cartilage.  Methods:   Patient matched OA and non-OA cartilage specimens were harvested from total knee replacement patients. Cartilage was first collected for metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics analyses to study global alterations in OA metabolism. We then determined the metabolic routes by tracking [U-13C] isotope with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We further evaluated cellular bioenergetic profiles by measuring oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and investigated the effects of low-dose and short-term effects of 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) on chondrocytes.  Results:   OA chondrocytes showed increased basal ECAR and more lactate production compared to non-OA chondrocytes. [U-13C] glucose labelling revealed that less glucose-derived carbon entered the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. On the other hand, mitochondrial respiratory rates were markedly decreased in the OA chondrocytes compared to non-OA chondrocytes. These changes were accompanied by decreased cellular ATP production, mitochondrial membrane potential and disrupted mitochondrial morphology. We further demonstrated in vitro that short-term inhibition of glycolysis suppressed matrix degeneration gene expression in chondrocytes and bovine cartilage explants cultured under inflammatory conditions.

Part of this reprogramming includes the activation of de novo synthesis of fatty acids that not only serve as building blocks for membrane synthesis but also as energy sources for cell proliferation. However, how de novo fatty acid synthesis contributes to PCa progression is still poorly understood. Herein, by mining public datasets, we discovered that the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACACA), which encodes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), was highly expressed in human PCa. In addition, patients with high ACACA expression had a short disease-free survival time. We also reported that depletion of ACACA reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis and PI3K/AKT signaling in the human castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) cell lines DU145 and PC3. Furthermore, depletion of ACACA downregulates mitochondrial beta-oxidation, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, a reduction in ATP production, an imbalanced NADP+/NADPhydrogen(H) ratio, increased reactive oxygen species, and therefore apoptosis. Reduced exogenous fatty acids by depleting lipid or lowering serum supplementation exacerbated both shRNA depletion and pharmacological inhibition of ACACA-induced apoptosis in vitro. Collectively, our results suggest that inhibition of ectopic ACACA, together with suppression of exogenous fatty acid uptake, can be a novel strategy for treating currently incurable CRPC.""","""['Shaoyou Liu', 'Jiarun Lai', 'Yuanfa Feng', 'Yangjia Zhuo', 'Hui Zhang', 'Yupeng Chen', 'Jinchuang Li', 'Xinyue Mei', 'Yanting Zeng', 'Jiaming Su', 'Yulin Deng', 'Funeng Jiang', 'Shengbang Yang', 'Huijing Tan', 'Chi Tin Hon', 'Sun Wei', 'Zhaodong Han', 'Fen Wang', 'Weide Zhong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Fine-Tuning Lipid Metabolism by Targeting Mitochondria-Associated Acetyl-CoA-Carboxylase 2 in BRAFV600E Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'Quercetin Reduces Lipid Accumulation in a Cell Model of NAFLD by Inhibiting De Novo Fatty Acid Synthesis through the Acetyl-CoA Carboxylase 1/AMPK/PP2A Axis.', 'Oncolytic avian reovirus σA-modulated fatty acid metabolism through the PSMB6/Akt/SREBP1/acetyl-CoA carboxylase pathway to increase energy production for virus replication.', 'Targeting acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 for cancer therapy.', 'The mitochondrial H(+)-ATP synthase and the lipogenic switch: new core components of metabolic reprogramming in induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.', 'Lipid metabolic reprogramming by traditional Chinese medicine and its role in effective cancer therapy.']"""

Here, we examined the effect of androgen signaling on MYB expression and delineated the underlying molecular mechanisms. Paralleling a dichotomous effect on growth, low-dose androgen induced MYB expression at both transcript and protein levels, whereas it was suppressed in high-dose androgen-treated PCa cells. Interestingly, treatment with both low- and high-dose androgen transcriptionally upregulated MYB by increasing the binding of androgen receptor to the MYB promoter. In a time-course assay, androgen induced MYB expression at early time points followed by a sharp decline in high-dose androgen-treated cells due to decreased stability of MYB mRNA. Additionally, profiling of MYB-targeted miRNAs demonstrated significant induction of miR-150 in high-dose androgen-treated PCa cells. We observed a differential binding of androgen receptor on miR-150 promoter with significantly greater occupancy recorded in high-dose androgen-treated cells than those treated with low-dose androgen. Functional inhibition of miR-150 relieved MYB suppression by high-dose androgen, while miR-150 mimic abolished MYB induction by low-dose androgen. Furthermore, MYB-silencing or miR-150 mimic transfection suppressed PCa cell growth induced by low-dose androgen, whereas miR-150 inhibition rescued PCa cells from growth repression by high-dose androgen. Similarly, we observed that MYB silencing suppressed the expression of androgen-responsive, cell cycle-related genes in low-dose androgen-treated cells, while miR-150 inhibition increased their expression in cells treated with high-dose androgen.

Cancer-induced hypercoagulable state contributes to thrombosis and is often overlooked. Prostate cancer may not be of high thrombogenic potential compared with other cancers, but its high prevalence brings it into focus. Pathological evidence for venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) in prostate cancer exists. Factors such as age, comorbidities, and therapies increase the VTE risk further. There is a need to systematically identify the risk of VTE in regard to patient-, cancer-, and treatment-related factors to risk stratify patients for better-targeted and individualized strategies to prevent VTE. Sensitive tests to enable such risk assessment are urgently required. There is sufficient evidence for the utility of thromboelastography (TEG) in cancer, but it is not yet part of the clinic and there is only limited data on the use of TEG in prostate cancer. One study revealed that compared with age-matched controls, 68.8% of prostate cancer patients demonstrated hypercoagulable TEG parameters. The absence of clinical guidelines is a limiting factor in TEG use in the cancer population. Cancer heterogeneity and the unique cancer-specific microenvironment in each patient, as well as determining the hypercoagulable state in each patient, are added limitations. The way forward is to combine efforts to design large multicenter studies to investigate the utility and clinical effectiveness of TEG in cancer and establish longitudinal studies to understand the link between hypercoagulable state and development of thrombosis.

The purpose is to examine whether health behaviors and obesity among cancer survivors vary by marital status and whether the type of cancer and sociodemographic factors influence the relationship.  Methods:   We examined smoking, physical activity, and body mass index (BMI) among 1880 individuals diagnosed with prostate, breast, or colon cancer who were identified from the 2011-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). We used Rao-Scott design-adjusted chi-square tests and weighted multivariable logistic regressions to achieve the research aims.  Results:   Current smoking behavior and BMI were significantly related to marital status. Survivors who had never married were the most likely to be current smokers across all cancer types. Married survivors were the most likely to be overweight or obese, while widowed survivors were the most likely to have a normal weight. The relationship between BMI and marital status varied by cancer type. Widowed colon cancer survivors were least likely to be overweight or obese; divorced/separated colon cancer survivors were most likely to be obese or overweight. Health behavior disparities were found among cancer survivors of different age, sex, race, and levels of education and income.  Conclusions:   There were relationships between marital status, health behaviors, and obesity among cancer survivors.

Enhancer RNA is a subclass of long non-coding RNA transcribed from active enhancer regions, which plays a critical role in gene transcriptional regulation. However, the role of enhancer RNA (eRNA) in PCa remains extremely mysterious. This study is aimed at exploring key prognostic eRNAs in PCa. First, we downloaded gene expression data and clinical data of 33 cancer types from UCSC Xena platform. Second, we selected reported putative eRNA-target pairs and performed the Kaplan-Meier survival and correlation analysis to determine the crucial eRNAs most related to biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Third, we explored the clinical characteristics with the key eRNA GAS1 adjacent regulatory RNA (GAS1RR) and performed a computational difference algorithm and the Cox regression analysis. Next, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed to explore the underlying mechanisms. Finally, we used the pan-cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and performed reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) of 18 pairs of specimens to prove the results we acquired. Among all 2695 putative eRNAs, 6 pairs of eRNA-target genes were prominently related to BCR-free survival. Growth arrest-specific protein 1 (GAS1) was a target gene of GAS1RR (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). Patients with low GAS1RR expression were likely to have unfavorable clinical characteristics. The result of computational Cox regression analysis demonstrated that GAS1RR may predict the prognosis of PCa independently. RT-qPCR results illuminated that GAS1RR and GAS1 were both downregulated in PCa tissues, and they show a strong positive correlation. GO and KEGG analyses revealed biological processes that GAS1RR was mainly associated with. Immune infiltration analysis indicated that GAS1RR expression is correlated with the infiltration level of six kinds of immune cells. Our results suggest that GAS1RR may be clinically useful in the prediction of PCa prognosis. Moreover, it may also be a prognostic predictor and theoretic target with great promise in PCa.""","""['Zezhong Xiong', 'Yue Ge', 'Jun Xiao', 'Yanan Wang', 'Le Li', 'Sheng Ma', 'Lingning Lan', 'Bo Liu', 'Baolong Qin', 'Yang Luan', 'Chunguang Yang', 'Zhangqun Ye', 'Zhihua Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Exp Biol Med (Maywood)""","""['TBX5-AS1, an enhancer RNA, is a potential novel prognostic biomarker for lung adenocarcinoma.', 'LINC02257, an Enhancer RNA of Prognostic Value in Colon Adenocarcinoma, Correlates With Multi-Omics Immunotherapy-Related Analysis in 33 Cancers.', 'A Novel Set of Immune-associated Gene Signature predicts Biochemical Recurrence in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Enhancer RNA LINC00242-Induced Expression of PHF10 Drives a Better Prognosis in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'Functional roles of antisense enhancer RNA for promoting prostate cancer progression.']"""

Patients and methods:   In 2014, the Erasmus MC Cancer Institute and the primary healthcare diagnostic facility STAR-SHL (located in Rotterdam city centre) initiated this observational study, in which general practitioners (GPs) could refer men who wished to undergo PCa screening to STAR-SHL for consultation by specially trained personnel. Referral recommendations to secondary healthcare were based on the outcome of application of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator (RPCRC) and were compared to the current Dutch GPs' PSA referral threshold of 3.0 ng/mL. For data collection on PCa diagnoses, the study cohort was linked to the Dutch nationwide pathology databank (PALGA).  Results:   Between January 2014 and February 2021, 507 men were referred for consultation and in 495 men prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was tested. The median (interquartile range) follow-up from consultation to PALGA linkage was 43 (25-65) months. In total, 279 men (56%) had a PSA level ≥3.0 ng/mL, of whom 68% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 63-74) were considered at low risk according to the RPCRC. Within 1 year after consultation, one of these men (0.52%; 95% CI 0.092-2.9) was diagnosed with clinically significant (cs)PCa (i.e., International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group ≥2). Thereafter, another four (2.1%; 95% CI 0.82-5.3) low-risk men were diagnosed with csPCa. Of the high-risk men who were biopsied within 1 year after consultation (n = 61), 77% (95% CI 65-86) were diagnosed with PCa and 49% (95% CI 37-61) with csPCa.  Conclusion:   In a primary healthcare diagnostic facility, the RPCRC could reduce up to 68% of referrals to secondary healthcare, as compared to a PSA referral threshold of 3.0 ng/mL. Deploying the RPCRC in this setting resulted in a high csPCa detection rate in those men biopsied.

Methods:   We conducted 43 semi-structured interviews with a racially and ethnically diverse sample of patients diagnosed with low- and very-low risk prostate cancer who had undergone treatment for their prostate cancer. Interviews were transcribed, independently coded, and analyzed to identify themes salient for decision-making, with attention to sociocultural differences.  Results:   We found racial and ethnic differences in three areas. First, we found differences in how socialized masculinity influenced patient's feelings about different treatment options. Second, we found that for some men, religion and spirituality alleviated anxiety associated with the active surveillance protocol. Finally, for racially and ethnically minoritized patients, we found descriptions of how historic and social experiences within the healthcare system influenced decision-making.

Moreover, no previous study has compared OCPs exposure in two distinct ethno-geographical populations. The objectives were to analyze OCPs in PPAT of PCa patients from either Mainland France or French West Indies in correlation with features of tumor aggressiveness, after adjusting for potential confounders such age, BMI, and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of PPAT. PPAT was analyzed in 160 patients (110 Caucasians and 50 African-Caribbeans), 80 with an indolent tumor (ISUP group 1 + pT2), and 80 with an aggressive tumor (ISUP group more than 3 + pT3). The concentrations of 29 OCPs were measured in PPAT concomitantly with the characterization of PUFA content. Exposure patterns of OCPs differed according to the ethno-geographical origin. Most OCPs were found at higher concentration in Caucasian patients, whereas pp'-DDE content was twice as high in African-Caribbeans. Chlordecone was only detected in PPAT from African-Caribbean patients. Most OCP concentrations were positively correlated with age, and some with BMI. After adjusting for age, BMI, and PUFA composition of PPAT, no significant association was found between OCPs content and risk of aggressive disease, except of mirex which appeared inversely associated with aggressive features of PCa in Caucasian patients. These results highlight a significant ethno-geographic variation in internal exposure to OCPs, which likely reflects differences in consumption patterns.

Genistein (GNT) is an isoflavone found naturally in legumes. Isoflavones, a subset of phytoestrogens, are structurally similar to mammalian estrogens. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer and cytotoxic effects of GNT on PC3 cell line under three dimensional (3D) culture medium.  Methods:   The 3D culture was created by encapsulating the PC3 cells in alginate hydrogel. MTT assay, neutral red uptake, comet assay, and cytochrome C assay were used to study the anticancer and cytotoxic effects of GNT at 120, 240, and 480 μM concentrations. Also, nitric oxide (NO), catalase, and glutathione assay levels were determined to evaluate the effect of GNT on the cellular stress. The culture medium was used as the negative control.  Results:   GNT reduced the production of cellular NO and increased the production of catalase and glutathione, confirming the results of the NO test. Evaluation of the toxicity effect of GNT at the concentrations of 120, 240, and 480 μM using comet assay showed that this chemical agent induces apoptosis in PC3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. As the level of cytochrome C in PC3 cells treated with different concentrations of GNT was not significantly different from that of the control, GNT could induce apoptosis in PC3 cells through the non-mitochondrial pathway.  Conclusion:   The findings of this study disclose that the anticancer effect of GNT on PC3 cells under 3D culture conditions could increase the effectiveness of treatment. Also, the cell survival rate is dependent on GNT concentration.""","""['Seyedeh Masoumeh Khamesi', 'Mehdi Salehi Barough', 'Jamil Zargan', 'Mohsen Shayesteh', 'Nooshin Banaee', 'Ashkan Haji Noormohammadi', 'Hani Keshavarz Alikhani', 'Mohsen Mousavi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Iran Biomed J""","""['Regulation of multidrug resistance proteins by genistein in a hepatocarcinoma cell line: impact on sorafenib cytotoxicity.', 'Beneficial effects of genistein in suppression of proliferation, inhibition of metastasis, and induction of apoptosis in PC3 prostate cancer cells.', 'Genistein induced anticancer effects on pancreatic cancer cell lines involves mitochondrial apoptosis, G0/G1cell cycle arrest and regulation of STAT3 signalling pathway.', 'The mechanisms of anticancer agents by genistein and synthetic derivatives of isoflavone.', 'Modulation of Expression and Activity of ABC Transporters by the Phytoestrogen Genistein.

Materials and methods:   This was a prospective, single-center phase II trial in patients with high-risk prostate cancer (HRPCa). The control group included HRPCa patients who underwent RP outside the clinical trial during the same study recruitment period. The interventional group was randomized (1:1) to receive neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy plus abiraterone with or without apalutamide followed by RP. Complications observed up to 30 days of surgery were classified based on the Clavien-Dindo classification.

Methods:   RC patients treated for non-metastatic muscle-invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2000-2018). Independent predictor status for CSM of T and N stage groupings (i.e., T2N0, T3N0, T4N0, and TanyN1-3) was tested in multivariable Cox-regression models. Conditional 5-year CSM-free estimates were assessed at baseline and at 4 specific event-free survival times (i.e. 6, 12, 18 and 24 months), within each of the 4 examined stage groups.  Results:   Of 981 RC patients, 206 (21%), 416 (42%), 152 (16%), and 207 (21%) were T2N0, T3N0, T4N0, and TanyN1-3, respectively.

However, protein analysts have realized the limitations of protein-based approaches for identifying and quantifying proteins in complex samples, such as the identification of peptides sequences shared by multiple proteins and the difficulty in identifying modified peptides. Thus, there are many exciting opportunities to improve analysis methods. Here, an alternative method focused on peptide analysis is proposed as a complement to the conventional proteomics data analysis. To investigate this hypothesis, a peptide-centric approach was applied to reanalyse a urine proteome dataset of samples from prostate cancer patients and controls. The results were compared with the conventional protein-centric approach. The relevant proteins/peptides to discriminate the groups were detected based on two approaches, p-value and VIP values obtained by a PLS-DA model. A comparison of the two strategies revealed high inconsistency between protein and peptide information and greater involvement of peptides in key PCa processes. This peptide analysis unveiled discriminative features that are lost when proteins are analyzed as homogeneous entities. This type of analysis is innovative in PCa and integrated with the widely used protein-centric approach might provide a more comprehensive view of this disease and revolutionize biomarker discovery. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, the application of a protein and peptide-centric approaches to reanalyse a urine proteome dataset from prostate cancer (PCa) patients and controls showed that many relevant proteins/peptides are missed by the conservative nature of p-value in statistical tests, therefore, the inclusion of variable selection methods in the analysis of the dataset reported in this work is fruitful. Comparison of protein- and peptide-based approaches revealed a high inconsistency between protein and peptide information and a greater involvement of peptides in key PCa processes. These results provide a new perspective to analyse proteomics data and detect relevant targets based on the integration of peptide and protein information. This data integration allows to unravel discriminative features that normally go unnoticed, to have a more comprehensive view of the disease pathophysiology and to open new avenues for the discovery of biomarkers.""","""['Tania Lima', 'João Eduardo Rodrigues', 'Bruno Manadas', 'Rui Henrique', 'Margarida Fardilha', 'Rui Vitorino']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Proteomics""","""['Extracellular Vesicle Proteome in Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Studies.', 'The Proteome of Primary Prostate Cancer.', 'Seminal plasma as a source of prostate cancer peptide biomarker candidates for detection of indolent and advanced disease.', 'Identification of prostate-enriched proteins by in-depth proteomic analyses of expressed prostatic secretions in urine.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

Spending was stratified by 10 expenditure domains (eg, Part B/D drugs, radiation oncology [RO], etc), and 21 disease sites were extracted from claims data, from which an analysis of RO expenditures was performed on 2219 episodes from 2033 patients treated with RT. Expenses are expressed in per-beneficiary, per-episode terms.  Results:   RO expenditures comprised 3% ($14.7M) of total spending over the 8 periods. By primary cancer, the largest RO expenses were for breast ($2.9M; 20%), prostate ($2.9M; 19%), and lung cancer ($2.8M; 13%). For RO, total per-episode average spending remained roughly constant between PP1 ($6314) and PP8 ($6664; Ptrend > .05) and decreased ($6314-$6215) when indexed to the Consumer Price Index for July 2016. Average number of RT fractions per episode decreased from 19.2 in PP1 to 18.6 in PP8; this decrease was most notably seen for breast (-2.1), lung (-2.8), and female genitourinary (-3.5) cancers. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) charges accounted for $7.6M (51%) of RT spending and increased 5% from PP1 to 8, whereas conventional external beam RT made up $3.0M (21%) and decreased 8%. Expenses for image guidance ($2.5M; 17%; +2% from PP1-8) and stereotactic RT ($1.3M; 9%; +1%) increased.  Conclusions:   In inflation-adjusted terms, total RO expenditures have declined despite greater use of IMRT, stereotactic RT, and image guidance. Conversely, oncology costs have risen because of drug spending. Successful payment models must prioritize high-cost spending areas-including novel drug therapies-while accounting for high-value care and patient outcomes.""","""['Brian De', 'Grant Andres', 'Christine Bates', 'Edgar Staren', 'Eric Kutscher', 'Donald J Brooks', 'Gautam H Thaker', 'Joseph Buscema', 'Robert Gin', 'Nikhil Thaker']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Radiation Therapy, the Oncology Care Model, and the Enhancing Oncology Model: Threats Remain.', 'Drivers of Medicare Spending: A 15-Year Review of Radiation Oncology Charges Allowed by the Medicare Physician/Supplier Fee-for-Service Program Compared With Other Specialties.', 'Association of Participation in the Oncology Care Model With Medicare Payments, Utilization, Care Delivery, and Quality Outcomes.', 'Share of Oncology Versus Nononcology Spending in Episodes Defined by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Oncology Care Model.', ""Assessing Medicare's prospective payment system for hospitals."", 'The American Society for Radiation Oncology Workforce Taskforce Review of the United States Radiation Oncology Workforce Analysis.']"""

The robotic-assisted biopsy system (Mona Lisa) offers a minimal invasive approach via only two incision points ensuring maximal accuracy combined with protection of the neurovascular bundle of the prostate.  Objective:   Our purpose was to analyse the impact of robotic-assisted transperineal biopsy of the prostate on the erectile function.  Methods:   Our prospective study analyses the outcomes of 210 patients, who had undergone minimal-invasive, transperineal robotic-assisted biopsy of the prostate at the University Hospital Basel from January 2020 to March 2022 and provided sufficient data. Of these, 157 (74.8%) were included in final analysis.  Results:   Mean (range) age, prostate volume, PSA and IIEF-5 score at baseline were 63.8 years (46.1-83.6), 46.4 ml (9-310), 13.2 ng/ml (0.2-561), and 18.8 points (6-25), respectively. EF before and 1 month after intervention was assessed with the IIEF-5 questionnaire for the whole cohort. No significant change of IIEF-5 was observed for the whole cohort with a mean (± SD) decrease of 0.4 (± 3.1) points. Except for patients > 69 years, subgroup analysis revealed no change of IIEF-5 in statistically significant manner for all subgroups.

All of the cardiovascular diseases were involved in atherosclerosis. However, the pathogenic mechanism of FSH-associated atherosclerosis remains uncertain. Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were chosen to develop atherosclerosis, of which the plaques were analyzed with administration of short- and long-term FSH imitating androgen deprivation therapy-induced and menopausal FSH elevation. The study showed that short- and long-term exposure of FSH significantly accelerated atherosclerosis progression in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, manifested as strikingly increased plaques in the aorta and its roots, increased macrophage content, reduced fibrin, and an enlarged necrotic core, suggesting a decrease in plaque stability. Furthermore, expression profiles from the Gene Expression Omnibus GSE21545 dataset revealed that macrophage inflammation was tightly associated with FSH-induced atherosclerotic progression. The human monocyte cell line THP-1 was induced by PMA and worked as a macrophage model to detect inflammatory factors and cellular functions. FSH remarkably promoted the expression of IL-1β in macrophages and strikingly increased the chemotactic migratory capacity of macrophages toward MCP-1, but the promigratory capacity of FSH was attenuated in foam cells. Overall, we revealed that FSH significantly promoted the inflammatory response and migration of macrophages, thereby provoking atherosclerosis development.""","""['Jing-Li Han', 'Yu-Xuan Song', 'Wei-Juan Yao', 'Jing Zhou', 'Yiqing Du', 'Tao Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Follicle-Stimulating Hormone Provokes Macrophages to Secrete IL-1β Contributing to Atherosclerosis Progression.', 'IL-17A influences essential functions of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and is involved in advanced murine and human atherosclerosis.', 'Neopterin Counters Vascular Inflammation and Atherosclerosis.', 'The potential role of follicle-stimulating hormone in the cardiovascular, metabolic, skeletal, and cognitive effects associated with androgen deprivation therapy.', '99mTc-Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1.', 'Targeting endometrial inflammation in intrauterine adhesion ameliorates endometrial fibrosis by priming MSCs to secrete C1INH.']"""

Interestingly, in the CML cell lines where the 5' UTR is longer, AGAP2 protein levels are lower. We demonstrate that the selection of an upstream TSS involved the formation of a G quadruplex in the 5' UTR, decreasing polysome formation. After developing a bioinformatics pipeline to query data from the FANTOM project and the NCl-60 human tumor cell lines screen, we found HK1 expression can also be regulated by the same mechanism.

Cancer burden continues to grow globally, demanding the implementation of important preventative and control initiatives. Informative reports on existing routine cancer data are therefore required. This study describes the distribution and trends of cancer in Buffalo City (BFC) population, Eastern Cape (EC) Province for the period 1991-2009. Cancer patients were retrospectively surveyed in the database of Frere Hospital Oncology-Radiation Unit. Proportion by sex, race, geographical distribution in the province and top cancer sites were calculated. Direct method of standardisation was used to calculate Age Standardised Rates (ASR) for a subpopulation of patients residing at BFC; age-specific rates were applied to the reference population (World Standard Population). Trends in rates with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) for two most common cancers in males and females over time adjusted for age and sex and interactions between time and race were assessed using Poisson Regression. A total of 19 737 patients´ records were analysed; 38.8% (7 656) males and 61.2% (12 081) females. Most patients were Black Africans (81.5%), followed by Whites (13.5%), Mixed Race (4.5%) and Asians (0.5%). A larger proportion (46.0%) of the patients were from Buffalo City, while the rest were distributed in other municipalities served by Frere Hospital. Top five cancers in males were lung [22.5%, ASR 21.0], prostate [14.7%, ASR 9.2], larynx [5.8%, ASR 5.0], mouth [4.4%, ASR 3.7] and tongue [3.8%, ASR 2.9 per 100 000] in females; cervix [20.9%, ASR 23.0], breast [23.6%, ASR 20.2], lung [3.4%, ASR 4.7], ovary [2.1%, ASR 3.0] and corpus uteri [3.4%, ASR 2.8]. Trends showed a decrease in lung and prostate cancers in males, while cervix and breast remained stable in females. White males were two times (95% CI: 1.87-2.49) more likely to have lung cancer and five times (95% CI: 3.90-6.21) more likely to have prostate cancer than Black Africans. White females were 0.43 (95% CI: 0.44-0.73) less likely to have cervical cancer and three times (95% CI: 2.45-3.14) more likely to have breast compared to Black Africans.

It was aimed to calculate the prostate, testicle and bladder effective doses (ED) caused by F18 and Ga68 used in prostate cancer imaging with PET/CT via simulation with the GATE toolkit and evaluate the ED in terms of fertility.  Methods:   The prostate, testicle and bladder were defined together with their geometric properties and densities in GATE simulation. F18 and Ga68 with activity of 277.5 MBq and 151.7 MBq were identified in the prostate as a source organ. The ED, uncertainties, and S values were taken as an output file in the TXT format with the DoseActors command. S values were used for validation of the simulation.  Results:   The ED of the prostate, total testicle and bladder for F18 were found to be 6.627E-04 ± 1.799E-06, 12.74E-07 ± 4.11E-08 and 1.617E-05 ± 4.317E-09 (Gy/s), respectively.

Conclusion:   It was found that Ga68 produced high prostate and bladder ED, and F18 produced high testicular ED. In terms of male fertility, Ga68 seems to be a good alternative because it produces low testicular doses.

However, this analysis results in significant variability among pathologists, hence creating possible negative clinical impacts. Artificial intelligence methods can be an important support for the pathologist, improving Gleason grade classifications. Consequently, our purpose is to construct and evaluate the potential of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify Gleason patterns.  Methods:   The methodology included 6982 image patches with cancer, extracted from radical prostatectomy specimens previously analyzed by an expert uropathologist. A CNN was constructed to accurately classify the corresponding Gleason. The evaluation was carried out by computing the corresponding 3 classes confusion matrix; thus, calculating the percentage of precision, sensitivity, and specificity, as well as the overall accuracy. Additionally, k-fold three-way cross-validation was performed to enhance evaluation, allowing better interpretation and avoiding possible bias.  Results:   The overall accuracy reached 98% for the training and validation stage, and 94% for the test phase. Considering the test samples, the true positive ratio between pathologist and computer method was 85%, 93%, and 96% for specific Gleason patterns. Finally, precision, sensitivity, and specificity reached values up to 97%.  Conclusion:   The CNN model presented and evaluated has shown high accuracy for specifically pattern neighbors and critical Gleason patterns. The outcomes are in line and complement others in the literature.

Evidence suggests that unmet supportive care needs are prevalent in contemporary healthcare, particularly for men with advanced prostate cancer, whilst less has been written specifically about the supportive care needs of black men. Therefore this study will examine black men's experiences of support following prostate cancer treatment in England.  Method:   A qualitative research design was employed. Twenty black African and black Caribbean men were interviewed on a face-to-face basis to obtain insightful information about their experiences of prostate cancer. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. Data were analysed using thematic analysis which allowed for emergent themes.  Results:   In this study there were six emergent themes. These were: dealing with the treatment effect, support from loved ones, individuals and organisations, healthcare support, spirituality, and positivity. Black men used different coping strategies to deal with the side effects of treatment.  Conclusion:   Black men experienced a range of supportive care needs. Some men felt that their individual needs as black men were not met by healthcare professionals, although no specific reasons were forthcoming as to why they felt this way. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the support mechanisms that black men have used throughout the prostate cancer journey and to consider these approaches when treating and caring for black men.""","""['Obrey Alexis', 'Aaron James Worsley']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Oncol Nurs""","""['Life after prostate cancer: A systematic literature review and thematic synthesis of the post-treatment experiences of Black African and Black Caribbean men.', 'Adjustment strategies amongst black African and black Caribbean men following treatment for prostate cancer: Findings from the Life After Prostate Cancer Diagnosis (LAPCD) study.', ""Men's experiences of radical prostatectomy as treatment for prostate cancer."", '""Man in the driving seat"": A grounded theory study of the psychosocial experiences of Black African and Black Caribbean men treated for prostate cancer and their partners.', ""Prostate cancer and supportive care: a systematic review and qualitative synthesis of men's experiences and unmet needs.""]"""

However, it possesses a very low water solubility that can affect its oral bioavailability. In this work, we developed inclusion complexes of BCL with the highly soluble hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HP-β-CyD) and sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CyD) to increase the water solubility and anticancer activity of BCL. The inclusion complexes were prepared using the freeze-drying method and were then characterized in a solid state via differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray analysis and in solution via phase-solubility studies and UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy. The BCL/HP-β-CyD and BCL/SBE-β-CyD inclusion complexes were amorphous and rapidly dissolved in water. Both the 1H-NMR spectra and molecular modeling studies confirmed the penetration of the 2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile ring of BCL within the cavity of both cyclodextrins (CyDs). Due to the consistent improvement of the water solubility of BCL, the inclusion complexes showed higher antiproliferative activity toward the human prostate androgen-independent cell lines, DU-145 and PC-3, with respect to free BCL.

Conversely, O2 levels in most mammalian tissues range from 1-6% (physioxia). Such hyperoxic conditions in cell culture can alter reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, metabolism, mitochondrial networks, and response to drugs and hormones. The aim of this study was to investigate the transcriptional response to different O2 levels and determine whether it is similar across cell lines, or cell line-specific. Using RNA-seq, we performed differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses in four human cancer cell lines, LNCaP, Huh-7, PC-3, and SH-SY5Y cultured at either 5% or 18% O2 for 14 days. We found that O2 levels affected transcript abundance of thousands of genes, with the affected genes having little overlap between cell lines. Functional enrichment analysis also revealed different processes and pathways being affected by O2 in each cell line. Interestingly, most of the top differentially expressed genes are involved in cancer biology, which highlights the importance of O2 levels in cancer cell research. Further, we observed several hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) targets, HIF-2α targets particularly, upregulated at 5% O2, consistent with a role for HIFs in physioxia. O2 levels also differentially induced the transcription of mitochondria-encoded genes in most cell lines. Finally, by comparing our transcriptomic data from LNCaP and PC-3 with datasets from the Prostate Cancer Transcriptome Atlas, a correlation between genes upregulated at 5% O2 in LNCaP cells and the in vivo prostate cancer transcriptome was found. We conclude that the transcriptional response to O2 over the range from 5-18% is robust and highly cell-type specific. This latter finding indicates that the effects of O2 levels are difficult to predict and thus highlights the importance of regulating O2 in cell culture.""","""['Ricardo Alva', 'Fereshteh Moradi', 'Ping Liang', 'Jeffrey A Stuart']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['Supraphysiological Oxygen Levels in Mammalian Cell Culture: Current State and Future Perspectives.', 'How Supraphysiological Oxygen Levels in Standard Cell Culture Affect Oxygen-Consuming Reactions.', 'Induction of HIF-2alpha is dependent on mitochondrial O2 consumption in an O2-sensitive adrenomedullary chromaffin cell line.', 'Oxygen concentration alters mitochondrial structure and function in in vitro fertilized preimplantation mouse embryos.', 'Brain adaptation to hypoxia and hyperoxia in mice.', 'Control of Redox Homeostasis by Short-Chain Fatty Acids: Implications for the Prevention and Treatment of Breast Cancer.']"""

Methods:   The clinical data of 385 patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) in our hospital from January 2019 to June 2021 were analyzed retrospectively, including 168 patients with preoperative NHT and 217 patients with simple surgery. Clinical characteristics were compared in the above two groups, the laparoscopic RP (LRP) cohort (n = 234) and the robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALP) cohort (n = 151), respectively.  Results:   In the overall cohort, compared with the control group, the NHT group had a shorter operative time, less blood loss, a lower positive surgical margin rate, and a higher proportion of Gleason score (GS) downgrading after the operation (p < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference in hospitalization time, biochemical recurrence, urine leakage, urinary continence, or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (p > 0.05). In the LRP cohort, it was found that the NHT group also had shorter operative time, less blood loss, lower positive surgical margin rate, a higher proportion of GS downgrading after the operation, and faster recovery of urinary control than the control group (p < 0.05). There was no marked difference in hospitalization time, biochemical recurrence, urinary leakage, or PSA progression-free survival. However, in the RALP cohort, the NHT group had a significant difference in the GS downgrading after the operation compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In the overall cohort, multiple analyses showed that initial PSA level, GS at biopsy, clinical T stage, lymph node invasion, use of NHT, and surgical methods were significantly associated with positive surgical margin (p < 0.05) while NHT did not account for biochemical recurrence (p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   NHT can lower the difficulty of surgery, reduce positive surgical margin rate, and help recovery in short-term urinary control in patients with high-risk prostate cancer after LRP.

Methods:   A retrospective population-based cohort was extracted from Quebec public healthcare administrative databases. The cohort included first-time users of NHAs (ABI or ENZ) from 2011 to 2016. The primary analyses aimed to describe the overall temporal trends (2011-2016) of NHA initiators by chemotherapy status (chemotherapy-naïve versus post-chemotherapy), and prescribing specialty (medical oncology versus urology versus others).  Results:   The cohort comprised 2183 patients, with 1562 (72%) in the chemotherapy-naïve group and 621 (28%) in the post-chemotherapy group. While the majority of patients were post-chemotherapy NHA initiators in 2012, this proportion decreased over time and accounted for only 13% of NHA initiators by the end of 2016. Medical oncologists were the most frequent prescribers of NHAs (upwards of 60%) throughout 2012 but fell to 45% by the end of 2016. Conversely, the proportion of prescriptions by urologists increased from 22% in 2012 to 42% in 2016.  Conclusion:   Over time, there was an increasing proportion of (1) patients who initiated NHAs without prior chemotherapy treatment, (2) NHA prescribing by urologists, and (3) ENZ users.

However, it remains unclear which patients would truly benefit from these treatments. Furthermore, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) is a known poor prognostic factor in patients with prostate cancer. We investigated the association between the presence of IDC-P and response to therapy in patients with mHSPC.  Methods:   This retrospective analysis included 318 patients with mHSPC who received treatment at Nagoya University and its 12 affiliated institutions between 2014 and 2021. Their biopsy specimens were evaluated for the presence of IDC-P. The patients were classified according to their first-line treatment into the ARAT (n = 100, receiving a combination of androgen-deprivation therapy [ADT] and ARAT) or conventional therapy (n = 218, receiving ADT with or without standard antiandrogen agents) group. We compared the overall survival (OS) and second progression-free survival (PFS2) between the ARAT and conventional groups according to the presence of IDC-P to evaluate whether presence of IDC-P predicts the response to each treatment. PFS2 was defined as the period from mHSPC diagnosis to disease progression on second-line treatment or death. Propensity score matching with one-to-one nearest-neighbor matching was used to minimize the potential effects of selection bias and confounding factors. The clinicopathological variables of the patients were well-balanced after propensity score matching.  Results:   Most patients in the ARAT (79%) and conventional therapy (71%) groups were ICD-P positive. In the propensity score-matched cohort, the OS and PFS2 of IDC-P-positive patients were significantly longer in the ARAT group than in the conventional group (OS: hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; p = 0.047; PFS2: HR, 0.30; p < 0.001). In contrast, no difference in OS and PFS2 was observed between the ARAT and conventional groups in IDC-P-negative patients (OS: HR, 1.09; p = 0.920; PFS2: HR, 0.40; p = 0.264).

Therefore, we tried to introduce new indices for evaluating the dose distribution conformity and homogeneity of treatment volumes based on the tumoral cell density and relative volumes of each lesion in prostate IMRT.  Methods:   CT and MRI scans of 20 male patients having local prostate cancer were used for IMRT DP planning. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images were imported to a MATLAB program to identify lesion regions based on ADC values automatically. Regions with ADC values lower than 750 mm2/s and regions with ADC values higher than 750 and less than 1500 mm2/s were considered CTV70Gy (clinical tumor volume with 70 Gy prescribed dose), and CTV60Gy, respectively. Other regions of the prostate were considered as CTV53Gy. New plan evaluation indices based on evaluating the homogeneity (IOE(H)), and conformity (IOE(C)) were introduced, considering the relative volume of each lesion and cellular density obtained from ADC images. These indices were compared with conventional homogeneity and conformity indices and IOEs without considering cellular density. Furthermore, tumor control probability (TCP) was calculated for each patient, and the relationship of the assessed indices were evaluated with TCP values.  Results:   IOE (H) and IOE (C) with considering cellular density had significantly lower values compared to conventional indices and IOEs without considering cellular density. (P < 0.05). TCP values had a stronger relationship with IOE(H) considering cell density (R2 = -0.415), and IOE(C) without considering cell density (R2 = 0.624).

Early warning of potential RT toxicities can prompt interventions that may prevent or mitigate future adverse events. During intensity modulated RT (IMRT) of PCa, daily cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are used to improve treatment accuracy through image guidance. This work investigated the performance of CBCT-based delta-radiomic features (DRF) models to predict acute and sub-acute International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 GU toxicity grades for 50 PCa patients treated with definitive RT. Delta-radiomics models were built using logistic regression, random forest for feature selection, and a 1000 iteration bootstrapping leave one analysis for cross validation. To our knowledge, no prior studies of PCa have used DRF models based on daily CBCT images. AUC of 0.83 for IPSS and greater than 0.7 for CTCAE grades were achieved as early as week 1 of treatment.

Vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) mRNA was assessed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Nuclear twist expression was observed by immunofluorescence assay. RES reduced serum-induced invasion and VM formation. Serum-induced phosphorylation of erythropoiethin-producing hepatoceullular A2 (EphA2) and the expression of VE-cadherin at the protein and mRNA levels were decreased after RES treatment. RES inhibited serum-induced expression and nuclear localization of twist. Serum-activated AKT signaling pathway, including MMP-2 and laminin subunit 5 gamma-2, was impaired by RES.

All images were assessed independently by 3 readers masked to all clinical information using a 3-point qualitative scale (0 = no recurrence, 1 = undetermined, and 2 = recurrence). Patients were monitored for approximately 6 mo. An independent panel with a urologist, radiologist, and nuclear physician reviewed all clinical data, including imaging and response to therapy, but were masked regarding PET/CT information; acting in consensus, they determined a patient-based and region-based composite standard of truth for PCa lesions. The ""correct detection rates"" for PCa lesions on a patient basis for each radiopharmaceutical were compared for the 3 readers individually and for the ""average reader."" Secondary objectives included determining whether PET/CT findings affected diagnostic thinking (impact of a test result on posttest vs. pretest probability of a correct diagnosis), therapeutic decision making (description and quantification of impact of diagnostic information gained with both radiopharmaceuticals on patient management), and adequacy of management changes. Results: A total of 190 patients were included. The primary endpoint was met. The overall correct detection rates were 0.82 for 18F-PSMA-1007 and 0.65 for 18F-fluorocholine (P < 0.0001) when undetermined findings were considered positive for malignancy and 0.77 and 0.57, respectively (P < 0.0001), when undetermined findings were considered negative for malignancy.

Risk estimates were determined by the level of diagnostic activity and estimated life expectancy. Higher exposure to diagnostic activity resulted in more prostate cancer diagnoses. This was especially true for men diagnosed with low or intermediate grade disease. Men exposed to high diagnostic compared to low diagnostic activity had a five-fold increased lifetime risk (22% vs. 5%) of being diagnosed with a low or intermediate-risk prostate cancer and half the risk of being diagnosed with a high-risk prostate cancer (6% vs. 13%). Men with a long life expectancy had a higher lifetime risk of a prostate cancer diagnosis both overall (21% vs. 15%) and in all risk categories when compared to men with a short life expectancy.

Host genetic factors, and inflammation-induced cytokines, play a key role in prostate oncogenesis. Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in cytokine genes were suggested to increase the susceptibility for PCa development and progression. This study aimed to investigate the association between the SNP (rs16944) in the interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) gene and the serum levels of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Prolactine (PRL), testosterone, and IL-1β in Iraqi PCa patients versus healthy controls.  Methods:   Taqman Real Time-PCR, was performed to investigate the IL-1β (rs16944) polymorphism in 100 Iraqi PCa patients and 50 age-matched healthy controls in a case-control study. Serum levels of PSA, PRL, and testosterone were determined by ELISA and FIA, and associated with the IL-1β serum level as well as with the SNP (rs 16944). The association between the clinico-pathological parameters and the genotype distribution of PCa patients was also studied.  Results:   There level of IL-1β was significant increased in the serum of PCa patients compared to controls (P = 8.19 10-7). Serum levels for other biomarkers such as PSA, PRL and testosterone were also significantly elevated in patients compared to controls (P < 0.0001). No differences were seen for genotype and allele distribution between PCa patients and controls. Nevertheless, in the group of controls, we found that 36% carried the GG genotype against only 26% in the patients group.This suggests that this could be a protective genotype (OR 0.62, P = 0.254). In addition, we found that the GA genotype is slightly more frequent in patients as compared to controls (OR 1.22, P = 0.605). Interestingly, serum levels of IL-1β, PSA, PRL and testosterone were significantly higher in PCa patients carrying the GA genotype, and the GA and AA genotypes are strongly associated with the aggressive behavior of the disease such as advanced TNM, and high Gleason score.  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that both serum IL-1β level and IL-1β SNP (rs16944) may be considered as candidate biomarkers for PCa.

Meanwhile, the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of prostate cancer implies that lifestyle and ecological changes may be associated with prostate cancer, however, sufficient evidence is still lacking. This paper tried to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of prostate cancer in China and explore the potential associations with related socioeconomic and natural condition factors. Data on prostate cancer incidence and mortality in 182 counties (districts) in mainland China from 2014-2016 were collected, and the distribution characteristics of prostate cancer were analyzed using spatiotemporal scan statistic. Spatial regression models and geodetector method were used to analyze the potential associations between meteorological conditions, socioeconomic development, and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. SaTScan, GeoDa, and GeoDetector were used for the above statistical analyses. The high-risk clusters for prostate cancer incidence and mortality were located in southeastern China, and the low-risk clusters were located in north-central China. Spatial regression models showed that the number of industrial enterprises/km2 (incidence: β = 0.322, P < 0.001; mortality: β = 0.179, P < 0.001), GDP (incidence:β = 0.553, P < 0.001; mortality: β = 0.324, P < 0.001), number of beds in medical and health institutions/1000 persons (incidence: β = 0.111, P = 0.005; mortality: β = 0.068, P = 0.021), and urbanization rate (incidence: β = 0.156, P < 0.001; mortality: β = 0.100, P < 0.001) were positively associated with the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer. The urbanization rate (incidence: q = 0.185, P < 0.001; mortality: q = 0.182, P < 0.001) has the greatest explanatory power, and the interaction of all factors was bivariate enhanced or nonlinearly enhanced.

Methods:   This prospective study included 72 high-risk non-metastatic PCa patients receiving NCHT followed by radical prostatectomy from June 2021 to March 2022. PSA testing, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and mpMRI scanning were conducted in all patients before and after NCHT. Therapeutic responses to NCHT were evaluated with PSA, RECIST 1.1, PERCIST 1.0, and EAU/EANM recommended criteria. Postoperative pathological results were considered the reference standard. A favourable pathological response was defined as pathologic complete remission (pCR) or minimal residual disease (MRD). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Cohen's kappa index. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictive value of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT-derived parameters.  Results:   All cases experienced a marked decrease in PSA levels after NCHT. Twenty-four (33.33%) cases experienced a favourable pathological response, including five (6.94%) cases of pCR and 19 (26.39%) cases of MRD. According to the results of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, EAU/EANM recommended criteria indicated that 20 (27.78%) cases had a CR, whereas PERCIST 1.0 criteria indicated that 23 (31.94%) cases had a CR.

The sensitivity (75.00%, 79.17% vs. 58.33%, 58.33%), specificity (95.83%, 91.67% vs. 83.33%, 68.75%), PLR (18.00, 9.50 vs. 3.50, 1.87), NLR (0.26, 0.23 vs. 0.50, 0.61), PPV (90.0%, 82.6% vs. 63.6%, 48.3%), and NPV (88.5%, 89.8% vs. 80.0%, 76.7%) of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (including EAU/EANM recommended criteria and PERCIST 1.0 criteria) to predict favourable pathological responses were all superior to those of mpMRI and nadir PSA. The kappa index to predict a favourable pathological response was 0.257 for PSA, 0.426 for RECIST 1.1, 0.716 for PERCIST 1.0, and 0.739 for EAU/EANM recommended criteria. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that the post-NCHT maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) before radical prostatectomy was an independent predictor of a favourable pathological response to NCHT.  Conclusions:   [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT had a better concordance with a favourable pathological response to NCHT compared with nadir PSA and mpMRI. EAU/EANM recommended criteria and PERCIST 1.0 criteria performed equally to identify pathological responders when [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was used as a therapeutic response assessment tool.""","""['Zhi-Bin Ke#', 'Shao-Ming Chen#', 'Jia-Yin Chen#', 'Shao-Hao Chen', 'Qi You', 'Jiang-Bo Sun', 'Yu-Ting Xue', 'Xiong-Lin Sun', 'Xiao-Hui Wu', 'Qing-Shui Zheng', 'Yong Wei', 'Xue-Yi Xue', 'Ning Xu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Histological comparison between predictive value of preoperative 3-T multiparametric MRI and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan for pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of 68 Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron-emission tomography (PET) and multiparametric (mp)MRI to detect intermediate-grade intra-prostatic prostate cancer using whole-mount pathology: impact of the addition of 68 Ga-PSMA PET to mpMRI.', 'Diagnostic Performance and Clinical Impact of PSMA PET/CT versus mpMRI in Patients with a High Suspicion of Prostate Cancer and Previously Negative Biopsy: A Prospective Trial (PROSPET-BX).', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.']"""

Equitable enrollment in clinical trials is fundamental to promoting health equity.  Objective:   To evaluate disparities in the inclusion of racial and ethnic minority groups and older adults across PCa clinical trials.  Data sources:   MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to identify primary trial reports from each database's inception through February 2021. Global incidence in age subgroups and US population-based incidence in racial and ethnic subgroups were acquired from the Global Burden of Disease and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 21 incidence databases respectively.  Study selection:   All phase 2/3 randomized PCa clinical trials were eligible for age disparity analyses. Trials recruiting exclusively from the US were eligible for primary racial and ethnic disparity analyses.  Data extraction and synthesis:   This study was reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.  Main outcomes and measures:   Enrollment incidence ratios (EIRs), trial proportions (TPs) of participants 65 years or older or members of a racial and ethnic subgroup divided by global incidence in the corresponding age group, or US population-based incidence in the corresponding racial and ethnic subgroup, were calculated. Meta-regression was used to explore associations between trial characteristics and EIRs and trends in EIRs during the past 3 decades.  Results:   Of 9552 participants among trials reporting race, 954 (10.8%) were African American/Black, 80 (1.5%) were Asian/Pacific Islander, and 8518 (78.5) were White. Of 65 US trials, 45 (69.2%) reported race and only 9 (13.8%) reported data on all 5 US racial categories. Of 286 global trials, 75 (26.2%) reported the enrollment proportion of older adults. Outcomes by race and age were reported in 2 (3.1%) and 41 (15.0%) trials, respectively. Black (EIR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83) and Hispanic (EIR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59-0.83) patients were significantly underrepresented in US trials. There was no disparity in older adult representation (TP, 21 143 [71.1%]; EIR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05). The representation of Black patients was lower in larger trials (meta-regression coefficient, -0.06; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.02; P = .002).  Conclusions and relevance:   The results of this meta-analysis suggest that Black and Hispanic men are underrepresented in trials compared with their share of PCa incidence. The representation of Black patients has consistently remained low during the past 2 decades.""","""['Irbaz Bin Riaz', 'Mahnoor Islam', 'Waleed Ikram', 'Syed Arsalan Ahmed Naqvi', 'Hamza Maqsood', 'Yusra Saleem', 'Anum Riaz', 'Praful Ravi', 'Zhen Wang', 'Syed A Hussain', 'Jeremy Lyle Warner', 'Folakemi T Odedina', 'Narjust Duma', 'Parminder Singh', 'Kenneth L Kehl', 'Sophia C Kamran', 'Mohammad Hassan Murad', 'Adam Landman', 'Eliezer Van Allen', 'Alan Haruo Bryce']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Declining Representation and Reporting of Racial and Ethnic Minority Patients in Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Despite Persistent Health Disparities-Where Progress Confronts Limitations.', 'Current Trends for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Among Medical Faculty and Clinical Trial Participation.', 'Disparities in Representation of Women, Older Adults, and Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Trials.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Assessment of the Inclusion of Racial/Ethnic Minority, Female, and Older Individuals in Vaccine Clinical Trials.', 'Is Our Science Representative?

A high-quality lipoaspirate has been a key factor for extended graft longevity.  Objective:   To assess the viability and potency of stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells and adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in fat samples from lipoaspirates harvested with a novel 1470-nm diode, radial emitting LAL platform. Two processing methods, enzymatic and nonenzymatic, were compared.  Methods:   Laser-assisted liposuction lipoaspirates harvested from 10 subjects were examined for cell viability after processing by enzymatic or nonenzymatic methods. Isolated SVF cells were cultured with an ASC-permissive medium to assess their viability and proliferation capacity by cell proliferation assay. Flow cytometric analysis with ASC-specific markers, gene expression levels, and immunofluorescence for ASC transcription factors were also conducted.  Results:   Lipoaspirates showed high SVF cell viability of 97% ± 0.02% and 98% ± 0.01%, averaged SVF cell count of 8.7 × 10 6 ± 3.9 × 10 6 and 9.4 × 10 6 ± 4.2 × 10 6 cells per mL, and averaged ASC count of 1 × 10 6 ± 2.2 × 10 5 and 1.2 × 10 6 ± 5 × 10 5 cells per mL in nonenzymatic and enzymatic methods, respectively. The ASC-specific markers, gene expression levels, and immunofluorescence for ASC transcription factors confirmed the adipose origin of the cells.  Conclusions:   The laser lipoaspirates provide a high yield of viable and potent SVF cells and ASCs through both nonenzymatic and enzymatic processes. Improved purity of the harvested lipoaspirate and high ASC content are expected to result in extended graft longevity. Furthermore, eliminating enzymatic digestion may provide advantages, such as reducing process time, cost, and regulatory constraints.""","""['Eyal Shapira', 'Lori Plonski', 'Shaked Menashe', 'Andre Ofek', 'Adaya Rosenthal', 'Massimiliano Brambilla', 'Gary Goldenberg', 'Sahar Haimowitz', 'Lior Heller']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ann Plast Surg""","""['Improved GMP compliant approach to manipulate lipoaspirates, to cryopreserve stromal vascular fraction, and to expand adipose stem cells in xeno-free media.', 'Isolation of human adipose-derived stromal cells using laser-assisted liposuction and their therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine.', 'Enhancement of Viable Adipose-Derived Stem Cells in Lipoaspirate by Buffering Tumescent with Sodium Bicarbonate.', 'Ultrasound-Assisted Liposuction Does Not Compromise the Regenerative Potential of Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.', 'Comparison between stem cells harvested from wet and dry lipoaspirates.']"""

Increasing evidence has supported plant extracts and natural plant derivatives as promising antitumor therapy with less toxic side effects. Yuanhuacine is an active component isolated from Daphne genkwa and can effectively suppress the tumorigenesis of several cancers. However, its role in PCa remains unclear. In this study, yuanhuacine dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of PCa cells. Moreover, yuanhuacine also restrained the invasion and migration of PCa cells. Mechanically, yuanhuacine decreased the ubiquitination and degradation of p53 protein, and ultimately increased p53 levels, which was regulated by inhibiting the phosphorylation and total protein levels of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2). Moreover, elevation of MDM2 reversed the suppressive efficacy of yuanhuacine in PCa cell viability, invasion, and migration. The network pharmacologic and bioinformatics analysis confirmed that MDM2 might be a common target of D. genkwa and LINC00665. Furthermore, yuanhuacine inhibited LINC00665 expression. Upregulation of LINC00665 reversed yuanhuacine-mediated inhibition in MDM2 protein expression and suppressed p53 levels by enhancing its ubiquitination in yuanhuacine-treated cells. Importantly, the inhibitory effects of yuanhuacine on cell viability and metastatic potential were offset after LINC00665 elevation. Together, the current findings highlight that yuanhuacine may possess tumor-suppressive efficacy by inhibiting LINC00665-mediated MDM2/p53 ubiquitination signaling. Therefore, this study indicates that yuanhuacine may be a promising candidate for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Miao Yan', 'Xin Li', 'Jinbao Gu', 'Guojun Gao', 'Ziyu Wu', 'Peng Xue']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biochem Mol Toxicol""","""['LncRNA PVT1 contributes to invasion and doxorubicin resistance of bladder cancer cells through promoting MDM2 expression and AURKB-mediated p53 ubiquitination.', 'Hypomethylation-Linked Activation of PLCE1 Impedes Autophagy and Promotes Tumorigenesis through MDM2-Mediated Ubiquitination and Destabilization of p53.', 'MicroRNA-340 inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis by targeting the MDM2-p53 pathway.', 'Escape, or Vanish: Control the Fate of p53 through MDM2-Mediated Ubiquitination.', 'MDM2- an indispensable player in tumorigenesis.']"""

Materials and methods:   This study used the MATLAB program to reconstruct the 3D dose on the patient's CT based on the log file (Doselog ) for treatment delivery accuracy check. In addition, differences between the parameters in the log file and the treatment plan, such as the spot position, spot size, and particle number, were analyzed, as well as their effects on the dose distribution. The accuracy of the dose reconstruction algorithm was verified by comparing dose from TPS (DoseTPS ) and the dose recalculated based on the treatment plan (Doserec ). Twenty treatment plans of ten prostate cancer patients received carbon ion therapy, and their corresponding 160 log files were selected for analysis and treatment delivery accuracy check. The regions with dose higher than 10% of the maximum dose were selected and 2 mm/2% criteria were used for global gamma analysis. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the relation between dose deviation and delivery errors.  Results:   For the algorithm accuracy verification, the mean relative dose difference is 1.02% ± 0.12%. For prostate cancer patients treated in our facility using carbon ion radiotherapy, the average passing rate of the gamma analysis between the Doselog and the DoseTPS was 95.3%. The dose deviation caused by the difference in the spot position and the number of particles was smaller than that caused by the spot size deviation.  Conclusion:   This study established a 3D dose verification method based on log files to evaluate the accuracy of daily delivered treatment doses.

A descriptive time series analysis was performed, estimating monthly percent change and endemic channels.  Results:   Starting the confinement (April 2020), a general decrease in service demand was observed (R: -14.9% to -90.0%), with an additional but lower decrease in August 2020 coinciding with the first pandemic wave (R: -11.3% to -70.0%). Follow-up visits and ambulatory treatment showed no consistent reductions. New patients' consultations for cross-cutting services had a speedy recovery (1 month), but clinical oncology, specialized units, and in-hospital treatment resumed more slowly. Only breast and stomach cancer showed a sustained reduction in early-stage disease. Women and older patients had a more significant reductionin service demand. Conclusion: Despite no changes in service supply, the confinement induced a significant reduction in service demand. Variations by cancer type, service type, and population demographics deserve careful consideration for a suitable response to the emergency.

The ASR-Is of cancers related to opportunity screening activities (prostate and breast) increased until the early 21st century and then decreased. The ASR-I of cancers related to infectious agents continue to decrease (cervix, vulva, and stomach). There is evidence of control of cancer related to tobacco consumption (lung, oral cavity, bladder). In both sexes, the ASR-I of thyroid, colorectal and lymphoma cancers increased and those of ovarian cancer decreased. Between 1984-2020 the ASR-M for all locations decreased annually 0.7% (95% CI: -0.9, -0.5) in men and 1.1% (95% CI: -1.3, -0.9) in women. For both sexes, ASR-M decreased for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, lung, bladder, lymphomas, and leukemias; and increased in colorectal cancer. The ASR-M for cervical and prostate cancer decreased annually by 3.5% (95% CI: -3.9, -3.2) and 0.1% (95% CI: -0.5, -0.3), respectively.

Methods:   All incident cancer cases in Manizales collected by the Population-based Manizales Cancer Registry between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2017, and all deaths caused by cancer in the same period, were included. The population at risk was obtained from the National Administrative Department of Statistics databases. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated by sex and cancer site. Changes in trends were assessed using Joinpoint regression.  Results:   There were 11,188 incident cases, 56.7% in women. There were 4,996 cancer deaths, 52.6% in women. Breast, prostate, stomach, thyroid, lung, and colon cancers accounted for 50% of all incident cases. During this period, the incidence in women decreased and equaled that of men due to a significant decrease in cervical, stomach, and lung cancers, among others; likewise, mortality in women decreased slightly due to the reduction in deaths from cervical, stomach, esophagus, and connective tissue cancers. In contrast, in men, overall incidence and mortality remained unchanged.  Conclusions:   In Manizales, population aging has contributed to an increased burden of cancer.

Methods:   A questionnaire was sent to 922 Japanese Urological Association Teaching Base Hospitals. The items included were years of experience as a urologist, sex, workplace, treatment equipment owned, specialty area of daily practice, specialty area of urological cancer, and six hypothetical cases of AS. The cases were categorized by the following Gleason scores: 3 + 3 low risk of PCa, 3 + 4 intermediate risk, and 4 + 3 intermediate risk, with or without comorbidities for each case. Comorbidities were defined as cardiovascular diseases or illnesses warranting anticoagulant therapy.  Results:   Altogether, 1962 questionnaires were analyzed. Responses were almost equally distributed among all age groups. Workplaces included general hospitals (49.4%), university hospitals (40.3%), and cancer centers (4.2%).

A secondary aim was to compare differences in the prevalence of cognitive impairment.  Design:   This cross-sectional study compared 70 ADT-treated men with PCa aged 50-85 years to non-ADT-treated men (n=52) and non-PCa controls (n=70).  Setting:   University clinical exercise laboratory.  Interventions:   Nil.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Standardised assessments were conducted for cognition (learning, memory, attention, processing speed and executive function), muscle strength (grip strength and leg press), fitness (400 m walk), gait speed (4 m walk) and dual-tasking mobility (timed-up-and-go with a cognitive task).  Results:   ADT-treated men showed stronger associations between fitness and executive function and task switching relative to controls (both: p≤0.03). For both PCa groups (independent of ADT use), poorer dual-task mobility was more strongly associated with decreased psychomotor attention (both: p≤0.027) and global cognitive function (both: p≤0.031) compared with non-PCa controls. The overall prevalence of cognitive impairment was low (4%-13%) and did not differ between the groups.  Conclusions:   The presence of PCa, with or without ADT treatment, did not increase the risk of cognitive impairment relative to non-PCa controls, yet did alter the associations between physical fitness and some measures of functional performance with certain cognitive domains. This highlights the importance of men with PCa maintaining fitness and functional capacity to optimise cognitive health.

In order to evaluate the app from the patient perspective a qualitative study was conducted which examined usability, usefulness and potential for improvement.  Methods:   All patients using the app at the start of the study were invited to participate in semi-structured telephone interviews; 12 of 20 users (60%) followed the invitation. In addition, the questionnaire ""System Usability Scale"" (SUS) was applied. Qualitative content analysis was used to interpret the interviews.  Results:   The evaluation revealed that, overall, the app was regarded as very user-friendly, though some users encountered difficulties during the installation of the app and technical problems afterwards. Some patients experienced a feeling of security resulting from the symptom monitoring. Other participants did not see a personal benefit, but made suggestions for improvement in order to make the app more useful.  Discussion:   Symptom monitoring through the app ""Nachsorge-Pass"" has shown to be feasible. Potential for improvement includes the representation of the symptom course for patients, a stronger focus on psychosocial aspects, and a better integration of the app into the ongoing aftercare process. As soon as the number of users is high enough, a randomised controlled trial should be conducted in order to collect reliable evidence on the effectiveness of the app.  Conclusion:   The present study provides first clues about a patient-oriented design of an app for prostate cancer aftercare, which has shown a high level of user-friendliness in the first test with patients.

""Major"" urinary and sexual function bother were also assessed. Variation in outcomes was investigated using linear and logistic multivariable regression models adjusted for covariates: age, socioeconomic status, PSA at diagnosis, surgical technique, surgical specimen grade group, margin status, and clinician surgical volume.  Results and conclusions:   The analytic cohort included 13,083 men with the mean urinary incontinence domain score being 76/100 (SD = 25) with 9.2% reporting major bother. For sexual function, the mean score was 29/100 (SD = 26) with 46% reporting major bother. Of the examined variables, age at surgery and surgical volume category were most predictive of function, with disparities exceeding minimally important differences, though large variation was observed between urologists within volume categories. There is considerable variation in 12-month postprostatectomy functional outcomes. Variation is explained by both patient and clinician factors, though some confounders are unmeasured in this cohort.""","""[""Michael E O'Callaghan"", 'Matthew J Roberts', 'Kim L Moretti', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Daniel Gilbourd', 'Stephen Mark', 'Peter Heathcote', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Pcor-Anz', 'Nathan Papa']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Comparison of urinary and sexual patient-reported outcomes between open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matched, population-based study in Victoria.', 'Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Prospective longitudinal outcomes of quality of life after laparoscopic radical prostatectomy compared with retropubic radical prostatectomy.', 'Functional results and treatment of functional dysfunctions after radical prostatectomy.', 'Quality of life following radical prostatectomy.']"""

In the majority of patients, uncomplicated APN is diagnosed clinically and is responsive to treatment with appropriate antibiotics. In patients who are high risk or when treatment is delayed, microabscesses may coalesce to form an acute renal abscess. High-risk patients include those with a prior history of pyelonephritis, lack of response to therapy for lower UTI or for APN, diabetes, anatomic or congenital abnormalities of the urinary system, infections by treatment-resistant organisms, nosocomial infection, urolithiasis, renal obstruction, prior renal surgery, advanced age, pregnancy, renal transplant recipients, and immunosuppressed or immunocompromised patients. Pregnant patients and patients with renal transplants on immunosuppression are at an elevated risk of severe complications. Imaging studies are often requested to aid with the diagnosis, identify precipitating factors, and differentiate lower UTI from renal parenchymal involvement, particularly in high-risk individuals. Imaging is usually not appropriate for the first-time presentation of suspected APN in an uncomplicated patient. The primary imaging modalities used in high-risk patients with suspected APN are CT, MRI, and ultrasound, although CT was usually not appropriate for initial imaging in a pregnant patient with no other complications. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence.

Results:   The median follow-up was 38 months, 29.8% of patients had a recurrence, 34.3% had metastasis, 67.2% of patients died from any cause, and 37.3% died from urothelial carcinoma. Overall survival and CSS rates at 5 years were 44% and 61%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer before surgery, presence of muscle-invasive stages at RC and/or RNU, and prostatic urethra involvement were predictors for worse metastasis-free survival and CSS. Forty-one patients (61.2%) had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min before surgery and the number rose to 56 (83.5%) after surgery; 29.8% patients needed renal function replacement therapy after surgery (16 haemodialysis and 4 renal transplant).  Conclusion:   Patients with PanUC who undergo simultaneous surgery have adverse oncological (only 4 out of every 10 remain alive at 5 years) and functional outcomes (1 out of 3 will need renal function replacement therapy after surgery).

In a period ranging from January 2013 to October 2020, 1143 patients were evaluated. ASA classification was computed by trained anesthesiologists. Postoperative complications at 90 days after RARP were grouped as greater than one (CDS between 2 and 4a) versus up to one (CDS between 0 and 1). The risk association was computed using logistic regression models. According to ASA physical status classification system, patients were distributed as follows: 102 (8.9%) ASA 1, 934 (81.7%) ASA 2, and 107 (9.4%) ASA 3. Overall, 90-days postoperative complications occurred in 277 (24.2%) cases, of which 137 (12%) were graded as CDS 1 vs. 105 (9.2%) CDS 2 vs. 17 (1.5%) CDS 3a vs. 15 (1.3%) CDS 3b vs. 3 (0.3%) CDS 4a. ASA 2 and 3 patient categories were more likely to have 90-days postoperative complications CDS > 1 (12.5% and 16.8%, respectively) compared to ASA 1 patients (4.9%). The risk association was stronger for ASA 3 (odds ratio, [OR]: 4.085; 95%CI: 1.457-11.455; p = 0.007) than for ASA 2 (OR: 2.907; 95%CI: 1.106-7.285; p = 0.023) patient categories. After adjustment for clinical, pathological, and perioperative covariates, including pelvic lymph node dissection (performed vs. not performed), either ASA 2 or 3 categories remained independent predictors of 90-days postoperative complications CDS > 1. The risk of 90-days postoperative complications CDS > 1 after RARP increased as the ASA physical status deteriorated independently by performing or not an extended pelvic lymph node dissection. In the ASA 3 patients category, RARP should be performed at tertiary referral centers to safely manage the risk of postoperative complications.""","""['Antonio Benito Porcaro#', 'Riccardo Rizzetto#', 'Alberto Bianchi', 'Sebastian Gallina', 'Emanuele Serafin', 'Andrea Panunzio', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Clara Cerrato', 'Filippo Migliorini', 'Stefano Zecchini Antoniolli', 'Giovanni Novella', 'Vincenzo De Marco', 'Matteo Brunelli', 'Salvatore Siracusano', 'Maria Angela Cerruto', 'Enrico Polati', 'Alessandro Antonelli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""[""American Society of Anesthesiologists' (ASA) Physical Status System and Risk of Major Clavien-Dindo Complications After Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy at Hospital Discharge: Analysis of 1143 Consecutive Prostate Cancer Patients."", 'Predictors of complications occurring after open and robot-assisted prostate cancer surgery: a retrospective evaluation of 1062 consecutive patients treated in a tertiary referral high volume center.', 'Body mass index is an independent predictor of Clavien-Dindo grade 3 complications in patients undergoing robot assisted radical prostatectomy with extensive pelvic lymph node dissection.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'High BMI and Surgical Time Are Significant Predictors of Lymphocele after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

Our data support evidence that health within couples is both interdependent and transactional and suggests that one member's perception of the relationship is associated with biologic changes in one's partner, leading to better physical health of the couple. These findings may provide a biologic underpinning to observations of an inverse relationship between relational satisfaction and overall mortality and underscore the need for a dyadic approach to health.  Purpose:   Couples' health and health behaviors are intertwined, where the health of one partner can influence the health of the other but the biologic underpinnings are not known. We examined the associations between relational health and markers of inflammation and insulin resistance in couples coping with breast or prostate cancer.  Methods:   Participants (90 cancer survivor-spouse dyads) completed self-report measures of relational health including Dyadic Adjustment Scale-7 (relationship quality), Dyadic Coping Inventory (communication), and shared physical activity, as well as Community Health Activities Model Program for Seniors (individual physical activity). Inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP)) and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were measured in serum samples. Structural equation modeling including demographic and clinical covariate controls was used to estimate separate actor and partner effects of relationship quality, communication, and physical activity on CRP and HOMA-IR.  Results:   Participants were aged 63.1 ± 10.4 years with an average relationship duration of 30.0 ± 1.1 years. Higher survivor perceived relationship quality was associated with lower spouse CRP (b = - 0.07; 95%CI: - 0.13, - 0.01), whereas higher spouse perceived relationship quality was associated with lower survivor HOMA-IR (b = - 0.07; 95%CI: - 0.13, - 0.03). There were no other significant actor or partner effects observed.  Conclusions:   Among cancer survivor-spouse dyads, how one member of the couple perceives the quality of the relationship impacts disease biomarkers in the other, providing preliminary evidence for biological linkage between relational health and chronic disease risk.  Implications for cancer survivors:   Relationship quality may positively influence biomarkers of inflammation and insulin resistance in couples coping with breast and prostate cancer. Dyadic approaches to optimize survivorship health may be warranted.

However, it remains unclear how and to what extent these two events are coordinated. Here, we show that ARID1A, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, functions downstream of inflammation-induced IKKβ activation to shape the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Prostate-specific deletion of Arid1a cooperates with Pten loss to accelerate prostate tumorigenesis. We identify polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) as the major infiltrating immune cell type that causes immune evasion and reveal that neutralization of PMN-MDSCs restricts the progression of Arid1a-deficient tumors. Mechanistically, inflammatory cues activate IKKβ to phosphorylate ARID1A, leading to its degradation via β-TRCP. ARID1A downregulation in turn silences the enhancer of A20 deubiquitinase, a critical negative regulator of NF-κB signaling, and thereby unleashes CXCR2 ligand-mediated MDSC chemotaxis. Importantly, our results support the therapeutic strategy of anti-NF-κB antibody or targeting CXCR2 combined with ICB for advanced PCa.

Objective:   To compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) with adjuvant intravesical mitomycin C (MMC) at normothermia or hyperthermia using the COMBAT bladder recirculation system at 43 °C for 30 and 60 min.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective open-label, phase 3 randomised controlled trial (HIVEC-1) accrued across 13 centres between 2014 and 2020 in Spain. After complete transurethral resection of the bladder and immediate postoperative MMC instillation, patients with IR-NMIBC were randomised (1:1:1) to four weekly followed by three monthly 40-mg MMC instillations at normothermia (control; n = 106), 43 °C for 30 min (n = 107), or 43 °C for 60 min (n = 106) were investigated. Therapeutic compliance was defined as four or more instillations.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was RFS at 24 mo in the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) populations. The secondary outcomes included progression-free survival at 24 mo, safety outcome measures, and changes in health-related quality of life. Log-rank, Fisher, χ2, and analysis of variance tests were used.  Results and limitations:   The ITT 24-mo RFS was 77% for control, 82% for 43 °C-30 min, and 80% for 43 °C-60 min (p = 0.6). The PP 24-mo RFS was 77% for control, 83% for 43 °C-30 min, and 80% for 43 °C-60 min (p = 0.59). Six patients progressed to muscle-invasive disease in the ITT population (four in the control, 43 °C-30 min, and 43 °C-60 min groups each) and four in the PP population (all controls). Serious adverse events occurred in 26 patients (8.1%), and we were unable to demonstrate a difference between groups (p = 0.5). Adverse events, mainly dysuria and spasms, occurred in 124 patients (33% in control, 35% in 43 °C-30 min, and 48% in 43 °C-60 min; p = 0.05). The total International Prostate Symptom Score worsened by 1.2 ± 7.3 points, similarly across groups (p = 0.29). The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bladder domains and indexes showed no significant change.  Conclusions:   Four-month adjuvant hyperthermic MMC using the COMBAT system for 30 and 60 min in IR-NMIBC is well tolerated, but we did not find it to be superior to normothermic MMC at 24 mo.

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to PET-detected oligometastatic CaP has been shown to improve progression free survival (PFS) and delay androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to observation. For men who subsequently develop oligorecurrent CaP, outcomes following second SBRT are unknown.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Eligibility criteria included patients with oligometastatic (1-5 lesions) CaP detected on PSMA or Fluciclovine PET who underwent 2 consecutive SBRT courses to tracer-avid sites. Data on stage, tracer type, concurrent systemic therapy, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses for first SBRT (SBRT1) and second SBRT (SBRT2) were collected. Outcomes included PSA decline ≥50% (PSA50), PFS after SBRT2, and ADT initiation or intensification-free survival after SBRT2. Factors potentially associated with PSA50 after SBRT2 was evaluated with multivariable logistic regression. Factors potentially associated with PFS and ADT initiation/intensification-free survival after SBRT2 were evaluated with separate multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models.  Results:   Twenty-five patients were identified. At SBRT2, oligorecurrence was detected on PSMA and Fluciclovine PET in 17 (68%) and 8 (32%) patients, respectively. Fifteen (60%) patients had castration-sensitive disease and 10 (40%) had castration-resistant disease. After SBRT2, 16 (64%) achieved a PSA50 response, median PFS was 11.0mo, and median ADT initiation/intensification-free survival was 23.2mo. On multivariable analysis, maximum percent change in PSA after SBRT1 (OR 0.94, 95%CI 0.88-0.99, P = 0.046) and concurrent change in systemic therapy (OR 21.61, 95%CI 1.12-417.9, P = 0.042) were associated with PSA50 responses after SBRT2. PSA50 response after SBRT1 was associated with improved PFS (HR 0.36, 95%CI 0.00-0.42, P = 0.008) and ADT initiation/intensification-free survival (HR 0.07, 95%CI 0.01-0.68, P = 0.021) after SBRT2. From SBRT1 to last follow-up (median 48 months), 7 (28%) patients remained ADT-free.  Conclusions:   Serial SBRT for oligometastatic CaP detected on PSMA or Fluciclovine PET is feasible and can achieve PSA declines, with or without systemic therapy. Degree of biochemical response to first SBRT warrants further study as a potential predictor of PSA response, PFS, and ADT initiation/intensification-free survival following a subsequent SBRT course.

Methods:   We included men treated between 2000 and 2017 who had lymph node invasion at radical prostatectomy and persistently detectable prostate-specific antigen post-prostatectomy. Postoperative imaging and management strategies were collated. Patterns of recurrence and probability of metastasis-free survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were assessed.  Results:   Among our cohort of 253 patients, 126 developed metastasis. Twenty-five had a positive scan within 6 months of surgery; of these, 15 (60%) had a nodal metastasis, 10 (40%) had a bone metastasis, and 4 (16%) had local recurrence.

Therefore, targeted analysis of the polar metabolites in these pathways is of great value for understanding cancers, finding diagnostic biomarkers, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, it is still challenging to directly determine polar metabolites in these pathways without derivatization due to their diverse chemical properties, isomers, and strong polarity. Herein, a highly selective and sensitive HILIC-MS/MS method was developed for direct determination of the polar metabolites in aerobic glycolysis, PPP, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis pathways. Without derivatization, 19 polar metabolites and their isomers with carbonyl, carboxyl, or phosphoryl groups in human plasma and cell extracts of prostate cancer (PC) were determined with strong retention and high resolution. This method has been widely verified by measuring linearity, precision, sensitivity, repeatability, matrix effect, and accuracy. The analysis of plasma samples by HILIC-MS/MS revealed distinct PC-specific metabolic signatures compared to a healthy control.

Here, we investigated the correlation between the serum miR-148a-3p and miR-485-5p expression levels and cancer recurrence in PCa patients, aiming to identify new biomarkers for diagnosis and predicting postoperative recurrence of prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 198 male PCa cases treated with surgery, postoperative radiotherapy, and chemotherapy were involved in the presented study. Serum levels of miR-148a-3p and miR-485-5p were measured before the initial operation for the involved cases, which were then followed up for two years to monitor the recurrence of cancer and to split the cases into recurrence and non-recurrence groups.

This approach was previously demonstrated to outperform other deep learning methods, graph kernel models, molecular docking, and drug binding pocket matching.  Methods:   CancerOmicsNet integrates multiple heterogeneous data by utilizing a deep graph learning model with sophisticated attention propagation mechanisms to extract highly predictive features from cancer-specific networks.

However, the exact mechanism of bone metastasis in PCa remains unelucidated. Herein, we explored the function and potential underlying mechanism of exosomal miR-375 in bone metastasis and tumor progression in PCa. This study revealed that miR-375 expression was markedly upregulated in advanced PCa with bone metastasis and metastatic PCa cell lines. Moreover, miR-375 showed high expression in PCa-derived exosomes and could be delivered to human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) via exosomes. Mechanistically, miR-375 directly targeted DIP2C and upregulated the Wnt signaling pathway, thereby promoting osteoblastic differentiation in hMSCs. Furthermore, miR-375 promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa cells in vitro and enhanced tumor progression and osteoblastic metastasis in vivo. Notably, the expression of miR-375, TCF-1, LEF-1, and β-catenin in was higher in PCa tissues with bone metastasis than in PCa tissues without bone metastasis and showed a continuous increase, whereas DIP2C, cyclin D1, and Axin2 showed an opposite expression pattern.

Such attractive performance stems, inter alia, from the kinetic analysis of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against free PSA to select the mAbs exhibiting best kinetic characteristics and specificity. The analysis is carried out with a label-free multiplex spectral-correlation interferometry compatible with inexpensive single-use glass sensor chips. The high sensitivity of developed PSA immunoassay is due to electronic quantification of magnetic nanolabels functionalized by the selected mAbs and three-dimension porous filters used as an extended solid phase.

The pharmacological characterization of rapanone is still incomplete, and to fill the data gap, a good source for its acquisition is required to conduct further research. This study aimed to optimize the conditions for the extraction of rapanone from the leaves of white-berried Ardisia crenata Sims. For this purpose, three methods were employed: heat reflux (HRE), shaking (SE), and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and such parameters as the extraction time, solvent, and the number of extractions from the same sample were set as experimental variables. Furthermore, cytotoxic activity toward prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, and colorectal carcinoma cell lines was investigated and compared with doxorubicin and embelin. The most effective and economical method for the extraction of rapanone was shown to be 20 min UAE with ethyl acetate or chloroform. Rapanone exhibited high cytotoxic activity against PC3 (IC50 = 6.50 μg/mL), Du145 (IC50 = 7.68 μg/mL), FTC133 (IC50 = 6.01 μg/mL), 8505C (IC50 = 7.84 μg/mL), and Caco-2 (IC50 = 8.79 μg/mL) cell lines after 24 h and against the HT29 cell line after 48 h (IC50 = 11.67 μg/mL). Furthermore, it revealed a more favorable safety profile than either its homologue, embelin, or doxorubicin.

In recent decades, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has emerged as an efficient, adaptable, and unique technique for the detection of cancer molecules in their early stages. Herein, we demonstrate an opto-plasmonic hybrid structure for sensitive detection of the prostate cancer biomarker sarcosine using silica nanospheres coated silver nano-islands as a facile and efficient SERS active substrate. The SERS active platform has been developed via thin (5-15 nm) deposition of silver islands using a simple and cost-effective Radio Frequency (RF) sputtering technique followed by the synthesis and decoration of silica nanospheres (~500 nm) synthesized via Stober's method. It is anticipated that the coupling of Whispering Gallery Modes and photonic nano-jets in SiO2 nanospheres induce Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR) in Ag nano-islands, which is responsible for the SERS enhancement. The as-fabricated SERS active platform shows a linear response in the physiological range (10 nM to 100 μM) and an extremely low limit of detection (LOD) of 1.76 nM with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and enhancement factor ~2 × 107.

Since high levels of androgens increase the risk of PC, androgen deprivation therapy is the primary treatment; however this leads to castration-resistant PC (CRPC) with a poor prognosis. The progression to CRPC involves ectopic androgen production in the adrenal glands and abnormal activation of androgen signaling due to mutations and/or amplification of the androgen receptor (AR) as well as activation of androgen-independent proliferative pathways. Recent studies have shown that adrenal-derived 11-oxygenated androgens (11-ketotestosterone and 11-ketodihydrotestosterone) with potencies equivalent to those of traditional androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) are biomarkers of CRPC. Additionally, dehydrogenase/reductase SDR family member 11 (DHRS11) has been reported to be a 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that catalyzes the production of the 11-oxygenated and traditional androgens. This study was conducted to evaluate the pathophysiological roles of DHRS11 in PC using three LNCaP, C4-2 and 22Rv1 cell lines. DHRS11 silencing and inhibition resulted in suppression of the androgen-induced expression of AR downstream genes and decreases in the expression of nuclear AR and the proliferation marker Ki67, suggesting that DHRS11 is involved in androgen-dependent PC cell proliferation. We found that 5,7-dihydroxy-8-methyl-2-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethenyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (Kobochromone A, KC-A), an ingredient in the flowers of Carex kobomugi, is a novel potent DHRS11 inhibitor (IC50 = 0.35 μM). Additionally, KC-A itself decreased the AR expression in PC cells. Therefore, KC-A suppresses the androgen signaling in PC cells through both DHRS11 inhibition and AR downregulation. Furthermore, KC-A enhanced the anticancer activity of abiraterone, a CRPC drug, suggesting that it may be a potential candidate for the development of drugs for the prevention and treatment of CRPC.""","""['Yudai Kudo', 'Satoshi Endo', 'Masatoshi Tanio', 'Tomofumi Saka', 'Rin Himura', 'Naohito Abe', 'Mitsumi Takeda', 'Eiji Yamaguchi', 'Yuta Yoshino', 'Yuki Arai', 'Hirohito Kashiwagi', 'Masayoshi Oyama', 'Akichika Itoh', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Naohiro Fujimoto', 'Akira Ikari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Steroidogenesis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Leelamine, a Novel Inhibitor of Androgen Receptor and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

We identified losses of PTEN and RB1, MYC amplifications, as well as genomic alterations in TP53 and in members of clinically actionable pathways such as AR, PI3K and DNA repair pathways. Importantly, the clinically observed continued reliance of CRPC tumors on AR signaling is preserved across the entire set of models, with AR amplification identified in four PDXs. We demonstrate that PDXs and PDXOs faithfully reflect donor tumors and mimic matching patient drug responses. In particular, our models predicted patient responses to subsequent treatments and captured sensitivities to previously received therapies.

Here, we studied the occurrence and prognostic impact of sequence variants according to their clinical pathological significance (CPS) or their functional impact (FI) in 23 DNA damage repair (DDR) genes with a focus on the ATM serine/threonine kinase gene (ATM). All patients had at least one DDR gene with a CPS or FI variant. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the group with a higher number of CPS variants in DDR genes had a shorter time to treatment change (TTC) compared to the group with a lower number of CPS variants (p = 0.038). Analysis of each DDR gene revealed that CPS variants in the ATM gene and FI variants in the nibrin (NBN) gene showed a shorter TTC (p = 0.034 and p = 0.042). In addition, patients with CPS variants in the ATM gene had shorter overall survival (OS; p = 0.022) and disease-specific survival (DSS; p = 0.010) than patients without these variants. Interestingly, patients with CPS variants in seven DDR genes possessed a better OS (p = 0.008) and DSS (p = 0.009), and patients with FI variants in four DDR genes showed a better OS (p = 0.007) and DSS (p = 0.008).

The landscape and characteristics of germline mutations in genitourinary cancer are largely unknown, and their correlation with patient prognosis has not been defined.  Methods:   Variant data and relevant clinical data of 10,389 cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was downloaded. The subset of data of 206 genitourinary cancer patients containing bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), kidney chromophobe carcinoma (KICH), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) cancer with germline mutation information was filtered for further analysis. Variants were classified into pathogenic, likely pathogenic and non-pathogenic categories based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines. Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) database was used to assist risk analysis.  Results:   There were 48, 7, 44, 45 and 62 patients with germline mutations identified in BLCA, KICH, KIRC, KIRP and PRAD, respectively. Pathogenic germline mutations from 26 genes and likely pathogenic mutations from 33 genes were revealed. GJB2, MET, MUTYH and VHL mutations ranked top in kidney cancers, and ATM and CHEK2 mutations ranked top for bladder cancer, while ATM and BRCA1 mutations ranked top for prostate cancer. Frameshift, stop gained and missense mutations were the predominant mutation types. BLCA exhibited the highest ratio of stop gained mutations (22/48 = 45.8%). No difference in patient age was found among pathogenic, likely pathogenic and non-pathogenic groups for all cancer types. The number of male patients far overweight female patients whether PRAD was included (P = 0) or excluded (P < 0.001). Patients with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations exhibited significantly worse overall survival rate than the non-pathogenic group for all genitourinary cancers. More important, analyses assisted by gnomAD database revealed that pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations significantly increased the risk for genitourinary cancer in population, with the odds ratio at 14.88 (95%CI 11.80-18.77) and 33.18 (95%CI 24.90-44.20), respectively.

We investigated MS and PC diagnosis in black and white men undergoing prostate biopsy in an equal access healthcare system. We hypothesized MS would be linked with aggressive PC, regardless of race.  Methods:   Among men undergoing prostate biopsy at the Durham Veterans Affairs Hospital, medical record data abstraction of diagnosis or treatment for hypertension (≥ 130/85 mmHg), dyslipidemia (HDL < 40 mg/dL), hypertriglyceridemia (≥ 150 mg/dL), diabetes, hyperglycemia (fasting glucose ≥ 100 ml/dL), and central obesity (waist circumference ≥ 40 inches) were done. Biopsy grade group (GG) was categorized as low (GG1) or high (GG2-5). Multinomial logistic regression was used to examine MS (3-5 components) vs. no MS (0-2 components) and diagnosis of high grade and low grade vs. no PC, adjusting for potential confounders. Interactions between race and MS were also tested.  Results:   Of 1,051 men (57% black), 532 (51%) had MS. Men with MS were older, more likely to be non-black, and had a larger prostate volume (all p ≤ 0.011). On multivariable analysis, MS was associated with high-grade PC (OR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.21-2.48, p = 0.003), but not overall PC (OR = 1.17, 95% CI 0.88-1.57, p = 0.29) or low grade (OR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.62-1.21, p = 0.39). Results were similar in black and non-black men (all p-interactions > 0.25).  Conclusion:   Our data suggest that metabolic dysregulation advances an aggressive PC diagnosis in both black and non-black men.

While prior studies focused on concordance between patient subgroups, inter-tumor heterogeneity of AR enhancer selectivity remains unexplored. Here we report high levels of AR chromatin binding heterogeneity in human primary prostate tumors, that overlap with heterogeneity observed in healthy prostate epithelium. Such heterogeneity has functional consequences, as somatic mutations converge on commonly-shared AR sites in primary over metastatic tissues. In contrast, less-frequently shared AR sites associate strongly with AR-driven gene expression, while such heterogeneous AR enhancer usage also distinguishes patients' outcome.

However, evidence of all-cause and site-specific cancer risk associated with different bearing surfaces has varied, with previous studies having short latency periods with respect to use of modern Metal-on-Metal (MoM) bearings. Using the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry (AOANJRR) linked to Australasian Association of Cancer Registries data, our aim was to evaluate risk of all-cause and site-specific cancer according to bearing surfaces in patients undergoing THA for osteoarthritis and whether risk increased with MoM bearings.  Methods:   Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by comparing number of observed cancer cases to expected number based on incidence rate in the Australian population. All-cause and site-specific cancer rates were calculated for all conventional stemmed THA (csTHA) and resurfacing THA (rsTHA) procedures performed for osteoarthritis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare cancer rates for MoM, ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC) and resurfacing procedures with a comparison group comprising metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) or ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP) procedures.  Results:   There were 156,516 patients with csTHA procedures and 11,321 with rsTHA procedures for osteoarthritis performed between 1999 and 2012. Incidence of all-cause cancer was significantly higher for csTHA (SIR 1.24, 95% CI 1.22-1.26) and rsTHA (SIR 1.74, 95% CI 1.39-2.04) compared to the Australian population. For csTHA, there was no significant difference in all-site cancer rates for MoM (Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.01, 95%CI 0.96-1.07) or CoC (HR 0.98, 95%CI 0.94-1.02) compared to MoP and CoP bearings. Significantly increased risk of melanoma, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, myeloma, leukaemia, prostate, colon, bladder and kidney cancer was found for csTHA and, prostate cancer, melanoma for rsTHA procedures when compared to the Australian population, although risk was not significantly different across bearing surfaces.  Conclusions:   csTHA and rsTHA procedures were associated with increased cancer incidence compared to the Australian population.

We aimed to define the timing and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD), fractures, and diabetes in a patient population with CRPC.  Methods:   In the population-based STHLM0 cohort 1464 men with CRPC were identified and matched with three men free from prostate cancer (PC) in the Stockholm region of Sweden. Kaplan-Meier estimates of net survival were used to describe time to CVD, fracture, and diabetes. Cox regression was used to compare incidence rates (IRRs) for the respective late effects. Cumulative incidence analyses of late effects in the presence of the competing risk of death were performed to estimate absolute risks.  Results:   The Kaplan Meier estimates demonstrated a higher net probability for CVD, fracture, and diabetes among men diagnosed with CRPC compared to the matched comparators. The IRRs were 1.94 (95% CI: 1.79-2.12) for CVD, 2.08 (95% CI: 1.70-2.53) for fracture, and 2.00 (95% CI: 1.31-3.05) for diabetes, respectively, comparing men diagnosed with CRPC to men free from PC. The cumulative incidence of CVD at 12 months of follow-up was higher in men diagnosed with CRPC compared to healthy controls regardless of age with a difference in cumulative incidence being 0.20 for men aged <65 and 0.11 for men aged >84.  Conclusions:   In this cohort, the incidence of CVD was significantly higher among men with CRPC compared to healthy controls.

We measured myokine levels in serum obtained from patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) before and after exercise and assessed the growth-suppressive effect of the serum by applying it to a PCa cell line.  Methods:   Nine patients with mCRPC (age = 67.8 ± 10.1 years, time since mCRPC diagnosis 36.2 ± 22.5 months) undertook 34 min of a high-intensity interval exercise session on a cycle ergometer. Blood was collected immediately pre, post and 30 min post. Serum levels of secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-15 (IL-15), decorin, irisin, and IGF-1 were determined. Growth of the androgen-independent PCa cell line DU-145 exposed to serum collected at three points was measured.

The testosterone or dihydroxy testosterone (DHT) circulates through the blood, binds to the androgen receptor (AR) in the cytoplasm, and finally enters the nucleus to activate downstream target genes. We previously found that immortalized dermal papilla cells (DPCs) lost AR expression, which may be explained by the repeated cell passages of DPCs. To compensate for the AR expression, DPCs that express AR exogenously were established. In this study, we performed an RNA-Seq analysis of the AR-expressing and non-AR-expressing DPCs in the presence or absence of DHT to identify the downstream target genes regulated by AR signalling. Furthermore, we treated DPCs with minoxidil sulphate, which has the potential to treat AGA.

Therefore, we sought to identify genetic variants in Black patients diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer.  Methods:   Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA from a population-based cohort of Black men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 62 years or younger was performed. Analysis was focused on a panel of DNA damage repair (DDR) genes and HOXB13. All discovered variants were ranked according to their pathogenic potential based upon REVEL score, evidence from existing literature, and prevalence in the cohort. Logistic regression was used to investigate associations between mutation status and relevant clinical characteristics.  Results:   Among 743 Black prostate cancer patients, we identified 26 unique pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) variants in 14 genes (including HOXB13, BRCA1/2, BRIP1, ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2) among 30 men, or approximately 4.0% of the patient population. We also identified 33 unique variants of unknown significance in 16 genes among 39 men. Because of the rarity of these variants in the population, most associations between clinical characteristics did not achieve statistical significance. However, our results suggest that carriers for P or LP (P/LP) variants were more likely to have a first-degree relative diagnosed with DDR gene-associated cancer, have a higher prostate-specific antigen at time of diagnosis, and be diagnosed with metastatic disease.  Conclusion:   Variants in DDR genes and HOXB13 may be important cancer risk factors for Black men diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer, and are more frequently observed in men with a family history of cancer.""","""['Matthew R Trendowski', 'Christopher Sample', 'Tara Baird', 'Azita Sadeghpour', 'David Moon', 'Julie J Ruterbusch', 'Jennifer L Beebe-Dimmer', 'Kathleen A Cooney']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['Germline genetic variants in men with prostate cancer and one or more additional cancers.', 'Gene-based Confirmatory Germline Testing Following Tumor-only Sequencing of Prostate Cancer.', 'Germline Variant Spectrum Among African American Men Undergoing Prostate Cancer Germline Testing: Need for Equity in Genetic Testing.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Germline genetics of prostate cancer.']"""

Chromatographic and spectroscopic analysis was used to identify the synthesised carboxylic acid compound. The synthesised compound was treated with a PC3 cell line for 24 h with control. The cells were treated at various concentration ranges of 0, 3.91, 7.81, 15.63, 31.25, 62.5, 125, 250, 500, and 1000 µg/mL each. The cytotoxicity effect was studied by MTT assay, and their anticancer activity was further evaluated using cell cycle analysis, DNA fragmentation assay, acridine orange-ethidium bromide staining, and Western blot analysis. The end antiproliferative result showed that PC3 cell viability decreases in a concentration-dependent manner and the synthesised compound exhibited potent cytotoxicity against PC3 cells with an IC50 value of 26 µg/mL at the concentration of 125 µg. The increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed after treating PC3 cells with the sample in double-staining methods. S phase of the cell cycle was significantly blocked by the test sample, and a typical ladder pattern of internucleosomal fragmentation was observed. A decrease in the live cells was observed with the sample in AO/ET-BR.

However, the roles of other steroid hormones in prostate cancer and their effects on androgenic signaling still remain a mystery. Recent studies focused on the androgen-mediated regulation of protein quality control mechanisms such as endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and unfolded protein response (UPR) in prostate cancer cells. Present study, we investigated the action of progesterone signaling on ERAD and UPR mechanisms and analyzed the crosstalk of progesterone signaling with androgenic signal in prostate cancer cells.  Methods and results:   The mode of action of progesterone on ERAD, UPR and AR signaling in prostate cancer was investigated by cell culture studies using LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. To this aim qRT-PCR, western-blotting assay, immunofluorescent microscopy, nuclear fractionation and bioinformatic analysis were used. Our results indicated that progesterone positively regulates mRNA and protein levels of ERAD components in LNCaP cells. Also, it induced the IRE⍺ and PERK branches of UPR signaling. Progesterone receptor antagonist effectively antagonized the progesterone-induced responses. We also had similar results in 22Rv1 cells. Also, we tested the effect of the pharmacologically reducing of IRE⍺ and PERK signaling on progesterone-induced ERAD. Additionally, we determined the presence of putative progesterone response elements (PREs) in the promoter regions of ERAD members by bioinformatic tool. More strikingly, we found progesterone regulates AR signaling by modulating the nuclear transactivation of AR.  Conclusion:   Herein, we defined that progesterone hormone positively regulates ERAD and UPR mechanisms in prostate cancer cells and that progesterone contributes to the molecular biology of prostate cancer by regulating androgenic signaling.

Worse prognosis is found in those patients which exhibit castration resistance, relapsing into the disease with even greater aggressiveness. Hypoxia cancer cell adaption has been observed to be closely connected to fatal prognostic tumor features. Therefore, hypoxia adaptive mechanisms of cancer cells have attracted large interest as a relevant biological target for treatment-resistant patients. Dendrimers have been established as a promising nanotechnological tool owing to their beneficial physicochemical features such as multivalency and monodispersity.

G2Ru, as well as its cationic imidazolium precursor (G2P), displayed scavenging properties against intracellular and externally stimulated ROS levels, which would presumably hinder the stabilization of HIF-1α by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibition. Furthermore, these dendrimers have shown considerably beneficial properties against tumor progression capability in terms of apoptosis, cell cycle, CSCs expression, and epithelial phenotype promotion.

Objective:   To identify subgroups of patients, varying in situational, physiological, and psychological factors, who are more likely to experience fatigue an ordinary week of radiotherapy, and to compare patients experiencing and not experiencing fatigue regarding perceived HRQL and functional performance, that is, daily and physical activity and work ability.  Methods:   Cross-sectional study of 457 patients (52% women) undergoing radiotherapy (38% breast, 32% prostate cancer), using self-reported questionnaire data on fatigue, HRQL and functional performance analyzed using multivariable regression models.  Results:   Of the 448 patients who answered the fatigue question, 321 (72%) experienced fatigue.

However, no data are available on the optimal subsequent treatment option in patients treated with abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for high-risk mCSPC.  Objective:   We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of subsequent therapy after discontinuation of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with high-risk mCSPC.  Methods:   Overall survival and time to treatment failure from initiation of subsequent therapies were estimated by applying a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model using inverse probability of treatment weighting with a change of time scale to time on treatment.  Results:   A total of 217 patients received subsequent therapies: 127 received chemotherapy, 49 received non-chemotherapy, and 41 received other treatments. For overall survival, when adjusted with the marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model using inverse probability of treatment weighting, the hazard ratio was 1.212 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.742-1.979) for chemotherapy versus non-chemotherapy, 0.534 (95% CI 0.267-1.066) for non-chemotherapy versus other treatments, and 0.635 (95% CI 0.317-1.271) for chemotherapy versus other treatments. For time to treatment failure, the hazard ratio was 1.287 (95% CI 0.832-1.989) for chemotherapy versus non-chemotherapy, 0.785 (95% CI 0.486-1.269) for non-chemotherapy versus other treatments, and 0.898 (95% CI 0.612-1.318) for chemotherapy versus other treatments.  Conclusions:   No differences were observed between the treatment effects of chemotherapy and non-chemotherapy in patients with high-risk mCSPC after abiraterone acetate plus prednisone. These findings suggest that life-extending subsequent therapy after abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for mCSPC should be chosen at the physician's discretion and patient's preference.

We assessed perioperative, pathological and early functional outcomes in patients with clinically localised prostate cancer treated with Retzius-sparing versus standard RARP.  Methods:   A single-surgeon cohort of 207 consecutive patients undergoing RARP was analysed. A later study group of 102 patients receiving the Retzius-sparing approach was compared with an earlier control group of 105 patients receiving the standard one. Urinary continence recovery 1 week after catheter removal was the primary study outcome. Urinary continence recovery 1, 2, 3 and 6 months after catheter removal, potency recovery 6 months postoperatively, rate of perioperative complications and positive surgical margins were secondary study outcomes.

Early diagnosis of PCa recurrence is of high importance for successful salvage therapy. The aim of the present study is to analyze the efficacy of 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT in detecting the presence of local and/or systemic disease in patients with a history of PCa who have BCR. A total of 52 PCa patients with BCR referred for 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT were recruited from the American University of Beirut Medical Center between November 2017 and December 2019. We compared the performance of PSMA PET/CT to the results and clinical factors based on follow up: PSA, PSA kinetics, primary treatment, and Gleason score. The relationship between the PET/CT findings and clinical indicators of disease were assessed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. From a total of 52 patients, 34 (65.4%) had positive PSMA-PET/CT scans. Among those, 8/34 (23.5%) received primary RT. For all patients with a positive PSMA-PET: the detection rate was 2/4 (50%) for PSA < 0.2, 5/10 (50%) for PSA 0.2-0.49, 3/6 (50%) for PSA 0.5-0.99, 6/12 (50%) for PSA 1-1.99, 8/9 (88.9%) for PSA 2-3.99, and 10/11 (90.9%) for PSA 4-10.PSMA-PET/CT positivity was significantly associated with PSA level at time of PET scan, PSA doubling time, Gleason score and TNM staging. However, it did not show a significant correlation with radiotherapy as primary treatment, ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), time to relapse, and initial PSA before therapy. In our single center prospective trial, 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT successfully detected the recurrence of PCa in patients with BCR. Scan positivity was significantly associated with PSA level at time of PET scan, PSA doubling time, Gleason score, and TNM staging.

Here we observe an enrichment of transcription factor genes including HNF1B within PCa risk-associated regions. While focused on the 17q12/HNF1B locus, we find a strong eQTL for HNF1B and multiple potential causal variants involved in the regulation of HNF1B expression in PCa. An unbiased genome-wide co-expression analysis reveals PCa-specific somatic TMPRSS2-ERG fusion as a transcriptional mediator of this locus and the HNF1B eQTL signal is ERG fusion status dependent. We investigate the role of HNF1B and find its involvement in several pathways related to cell cycle progression and PCa severity. Furthermore, HNF1B interacts with TMPRSS2-ERG to co-occupy large proportion of genomic regions with a remarkable enrichment of additional PCa risk alleles. We finally show that HNF1B co-opts ERG fusion to mediate mechanistic and biological effects of the PCa risk-associated locus 17p13.3/VPS53/FAM57A/GEMIN4.

However, drugs selectively targeting QCCs are lacking. Saikosaponin A (SSA) derived from Bupleurum DC., is highly potent in eradicating multidrug-resistant prostate QCCs compared with proliferative prostate cancer cells. By further exacerbating the already increased autophagy through inactivation of Akt-mTOR signaling, SSA triggered cell death in QCCs. Contrarily, inhibition of autophagy or activation of Akt signaling pathway prevented SSA-induced cell death. The multicycle of Docetaxel treatments increased the proportion of QCCs, whereas administering SSA at intervals of Docetaxel treatments aggravated cell death in vitro and led to tumor growth arrest and cell death in vivo. In conclusion, SSA is posed as a novel QCCs-eradicating agent by aggravating autophagy in QCCs.

To compare severity of grading between patients and healthcare professionals, percent agreement and deviations for each symptom were graphically depicted. Stratified and sensitivity analyses were conducted to identify potential influencing factors and to assess heterogeneity and robustness of results.  Results:   The agreement for the 11 pelvic symptoms varied from very good (AC2 > 0.8: haematuria, rectal bleeding, management of sphincter control) to poor agreement (AC2 ≤ 0.2: proctitis and urinary urgency). Fatigue had a negative impact on the agreement. Patients tended to grade symptoms more severely than healthcare professionals. Information on sexual dysfunction was missing more frequently in healthcare professional assessment than PROs.

Secondary resection (SR) was performed in case a positive surgical margin (PSM) was observed with NeuroSAFE. Afterwards, the CLM images were non-blinded assessed for the presence of PSMs. The accuracy of both NeuroSAFE and CLM was compared with conventional histopathology. Agreement for detection of PSMs between NeuroSAFE and CLM was evaluated with Cohen's kappa coefficient. Procedure times were compared with a Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.  Results:   In total, 96 posterolateral sections of RP specimens were evaluated for the presence of PSMs. CLM identified 15 (16%) PSMs and NeuroSAFE identified 14 (15%) PSMs. CLM had a calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 86%, 96%, 80% and 98% respectively for the detection of PSMs compared to definite pathology. After SR, residual tumour was found in six of 13 cases (46%), which were all identified by both techniques. There was a substantial level of agreement between CLM and NeuroSAFE (κ = 0.80). The median procedure time for CLM was significantly shorter compared to NeuroSAFE (8 vs 50 min, P < 0.001). The main limitation of this study was the non-blinded assessment of the CLM images.  Conclusions:   Compared to NeuroSAFE, CLM is a promising technique for intraoperative margin assessment and is able to reduce the time of intraoperative margin assessment.""","""['Diederik J H Baas', 'Willem Vreuls', 'J P Michiel Sedelaar', 'Henricus J E J Vrijhof', 'Robert J Hoekstra', 'Saskia F Zomer', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Jean-Paul A van Basten', 'Diederik M Somford']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Neurovascular structure-adjacent frozen-section examination (NeuroSAFE) increases nerve-sparing frequency and reduces positive surgical margins in open and robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: experience after 11,069 consecutive patients.', 'A feasible and time-efficient adaptation of NeuroSAFE for da Vinci robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'NeuroSAFE frozen section during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: peri-operative and histopathological outcomes from the NeuroSAFE PROOF feasibility randomized controlled trial.', 'NeuroSAFE in radical prostatectomy increases the rate of nerve-sparing surgery without affecting oncological outcome.', 'Positive surgical margin during radical prostatectomy: overview of sampling methods for frozen sections and techniques for the secondary resection of the neurovascular bundles.']"""

We compared cancer-specific mortality between cryoablation vs heat-based thermal ablation in patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm, as well as in patients with tumor size ≤3 cm.  Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2018), we identified patients with clinical T1a stage renal cell carcinoma treated with cryoablation or heat-based thermal ablation. After up to 2:1 ratio propensity score matching between patients treated with cryoablation vs heat-based thermal ablation, we addressed cancer-specific mortality relying on competing risks regression models, adjusted for other-cause mortality and other covariates (age, tumor size, tumor grade, and histological subtype).  Results:   Of 1,468 assessable patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm, 1,080 vs 388 were treated with cryoablation vs heat-based thermal ablation, respectively. After up to 2:1 propensity score matching that resulted in 757 cryoablations vs 388 heat-based thermal ablations, in multivariable competing risks regression models, heat-based thermal ablation was associated with higher cancer-specific mortality (HR:2.02, P < .001), relative to cryoablation. Of 4,468 assessable patients with tumor size ≤3 cm, 3,354 vs 1,114 were treated with cryoablation vs heat-based thermal ablation, respectively. After up to 2:1 propensity score matching that resulted in 2,217 cryoablations vs 1,114 heat-based thermal ablations, in multivariable competing risks regression models, heat-based thermal ablation was not associated with higher cancer-specific mortality (HR:1.13, P = .5) relative to cryoablation.  Conclusions:   Our findings corroborated that in cT1a patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm, cancer-specific mortality is twofold higher after heat-based thermal ablation vs cryoablation. Conversely, in patients with tumor size ≤3 cm either ablation technique is equally valid.

Methods:   The main components and targets of BHD were retrieved from the TCMSP database, and the targets were normalized by UniProt. The Herbs-Components-Targets network of BHD was established by Cytoscape. The main BM targets were obtained from GeneCards, TTD, DrugBank, and OMIM. STRING and Cytoscape were used to construct a PPI network and obtain hub genes. DAVID and Metascape were used for GO and KEGG enrichment analyses. According to the network topology parameters, the top 4 components were selected for molecular docking verification with the core targets.  Results:   Compound-target network of BHD mainly contained 51 compounds and 259 corresponding targets including 107 BHD-BM targets. PPI interaction network and subnetworks identified ten hub genes. GO enrichment analysis found 1970 terms (p < 0.05), and 164 signaling pathways (p < 0.05) were found in KEGG, including PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, prostate cancer, MAPK signaling pathway, and IL-17 signaling pathway. Molecular docking analysis showed that the active components of BHD, quercetin, luteolin, kaempferol, and aureusidin have good binding activity to the core targets.  Conclusion:   The potential molecular target and signaling pathways were found for BHD major active components. It provides guidance for the future mechanism research of the BHD in malignant tumor bone metastasis.

However, the role of SEPT5 in PCa is still unclear. In this study, we attempted to explore the expression changes, clinical relevance and immunomodulatory function of SEPT5 in PCa. Methods: The expression and clinical significance of SEPT5 were evaluated based on bioinformatic analysis and were verified by western blotting, real time PCR and IHC. Allograft mouse models were used to assess the role of SEPT5 on PCa tumour formation and immunomodulatory function. Mass cytometry and IHC were used to determine the effects of SEPT5 on immune cell infiltration, especially CD8+ T cell infiltration. Correlations between SEPT5 expression and cytokine gene expression were analyzed based on TCGA and DKFZ datasets. RNA-seq and chemokine array were performed to confirm the effects of SEPT5 on cytokine production. Results: High SEPT5 expression was found in PCa and was associated with PCa prognosis. Importantly, downregulation of SEPT5 inhibited PCa progression in vivo. In addition, SEPT5 expression was negatively correlated with immune infiltrating cell levels, chemokine and cytokine gene expression associated with CD8+ T cell infiltration and activation. Downregulation of SEPT5 increased the proportion of immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells, in tumour tissue. Both the expression of CCL5, CXCL5, CXCL9, CXCL10 and INFGR1 were elevated in mRNA and protein levels after SEPT5 knockdown. Conclusions: In summary, downregulation of SEPT5 inhibited PCa progression, which may be mediated by increasing immune cell infiltration levels, especially CD8+ T cells, by promoting the production of IFNG-inducible chemokines and cytokines expression associated with immune cell infiltration. Our findings suggest that SEPT5 may serve as a prognostic biomarker of PCa and may be a target molecule to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for PCa in the future.""","""['Ming Chang', 'Yu He', 'Cong Liu', 'Risheng Lin', 'Xin Huang', 'Dongcuan Liang', 'Jian Zhang', 'Yi Lu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['Functional reprogramming of human prostate cancer to promote local attraction of effector CD8(+) T cells.', 'WHSC1/NSD2 regulates immune infiltration in prostate cancer.', 'Pro-inflammatory chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions within the Ewing sarcoma microenvironment determine CD8(+) T-lymphocyte infiltration and affect tumour progression.', 'Prevalence of tumour-infiltrating CD103+ cells identifies therapeutic-sensitive prostate cancer with poor clinical outcome.', 'Chemokines and cytokines: Axis and allies in prostate cancer pathogenesis.', 'A novel lysosome-related gene signature coupled with gleason score for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer.']"""

In the current study, we aimed to elucidate the role of YTH m6A RNA-binding protein 1 (YTHDF1), a ""reader"" of m6A modification, in prostate cancer tumorigenesis. Methods: We employed a multi-omics approach to detect the direct target of YTHDF1 upon manipulation of YTHDF1 expression in prostate cancer cells. Expression of YTHDF1 was also evaluated in human prostate tumors and either adjacent or paired normal tissues. Additionally, in vivo tumor growth and metastasis experimental assays were performed to evaluate the role of YTHDF1 in tumorigenesis. Finally, luciferase reporter assays and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were conducted to elucidate the transcriptional regulators of YTHDF1. Results: We demonstrated that polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a direct target of YTHDF1. YTHDF1 facilitated the translation efficiency of PLK1 in an m6A-dependent manner by identifying the m6A-modified PLK1 mRNA and subsequently promoted the hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Moreover, our results indicated that YTHDF1 was upregulated in prostate cancer tissue and that high YTHDF1 expression was associated with adverse prognosis in patients with prostate cancer. Furthermore, upregulation of YTHDF1 promoted prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, dysregulation of ETS transcription factor ELK1 activated the transcription of YTHDF1 by directly binding to its promoter region. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings suggest that the ELK1/YTHDF1/PLK1/PI3K/AKT axis is critical for prostate cancer progression and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Peizhang Li', 'Yuanping Shi', 'Dajun Gao', 'Huan Xu', 'Yun Zou', 'Zhong Wang', 'Wenzhi Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['HIF-1α-induced expression of m6A reader YTHDF1 drives hypoxia-induced autophagy and malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma by promoting ATG2A and ATG14 translation.', 'Methylation recognition protein YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) regulates the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma by regulating m6A level of CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7 (CNOT7).', 'The m6A reader YTHDF1 promotes ovarian cancer progression via augmenting EIF3C translation.', 'The roles and mechanisms of the m6A reader protein YTHDF1 in tumor biology and human diseases.', 'N6-Methyladenosine RNA-Binding Protein YTHDF1 in Gastrointestinal Cancers: Function, Molecular Mechanism and Clinical Implication.', 'The emerging roles and mechanism of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in urologic tumours progression.', 'Roles of RNA Methylations in Cancer Progression, Autophagy, and Anticancer Drug Resistance.']"""

Paracrine is the principally studied mode of communication between M2 macrophages and tumor cells. In addition to this, we present here a novel model to demonstrate these cellular communications. Methods: PCa cells were co-cultured with THP-1/ human peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived M2 macrophages in direct contact manner. Cancer cell proliferation and invasion were examined to explain how direct contact communicates. Cell-based findings were validated in two xenograft models and patients samples. Results: M2 macrophage direct contact induced a higher proliferation and invasion in PCa cells when compared with noncontact coculture manner. In direct contact manner, NOTCH1 pathway was greatly activated in PCa cells, induced by elevated γ-secretase activity and higher coactivator MAML2 expression. Additionally, blocking γ-secretase activity and depletion of MAML2 completely abolished M2 macrophage direct contact-mediated PCa cell proliferation and invasion. In vivo, inhibiting NOTCH1 signalling impaired M2 macrophage-mediated PCa tumor growth and lung metastasis. Notably, M2 macrophage infiltration as well as high NOTCH1 signaling in cancer cells indicated more aggressive features and worse survival in PCa patients. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the cell-cell direct contact pattern is an important way in PCa microenvironment cell communication. In this manner, elevated γ-secretase activity and MAML2 expression induced higher NOTCH1 signalling in PCa cells, which increased tumor cells proliferation and invasion.

Transient binding to serum albumin as a highly abundant, inherent transport protein represents a commonly applied strategy to modulate the tissue distribution profile of such low-molecular-weight radiotherapeutics and to enhance radioactivity uptake into tumor lesions with the ultimate objective of improved therapeutic outcome. Methods: Two ligands mcp-M-alb-PSMA and mcp-D-alb-PSMA were synthesized by combining a macropa-derived chelator with either one or two lysine-ureido-glutamate-based PSMA- and 4-(p-iodophenyl)butyrate albumin-binding entities using multistep peptide-coupling chemistry. Both compounds were labeled with [225Ac]Ac3+ under mild conditions and their reversible binding to serum albumin was analyzed by an ultrafiltration assay as well as microscale thermophoresis measurements. Saturation binding studies and clonogenic survival assays using PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells were performed to evaluate PSMA-mediated cell binding and to assess the cytotoxic potency of the novel radioconjugates [225Ac]Ac-mcp-M-alb-PSMA and [225Ac]Ac-mcp-D-alb-PSMA, respectively. Biodistributions of both 225Ac-radioconjugates were investigated using LNCaP tumor-bearing SCID mice. Histological examinations of selected organs were performed to analyze the occurrence of necrosis using H&E staining, DNA damage via γH2AX staining and proliferation via Ki67 expression in the tissue samples. Results: Enhanced binding to serum components in general and to human serum albumin in particular was revealed for [225Ac]Ac-mcp-M-alb-PSMA and [225Ac]Ac-mcp-D-alb-PSMA, respectively. Moreover, the novel derivatives are highly potent PSMA ligands as their KD values in the nanomolar range (23.38 and 11.56 nM) are comparable to the reference radioconjugates [225Ac]Ac-mcp-M-PSMA (30.83 nM) and [225Ac]Ac-mcp-D-PSMA (10.20 nM) without albumin binders. The clonogenic activity of LNCaP cells after treatment with the 225Ac-labeled ligands was affected in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas the bivalent radioconjugate [225Ac]Ac-mcp-D-alb-PSMA has a stronger impact on the clonogenic cell survival than its monovalent counterpart [225Ac]Ac-mcp-M-alb-PSMA. Biodistribution studies performed in LNCaP tumor xenografts showed prolonged blood circulation times for both albumin-binding radioconjugates and a substantially increased tumor uptake (46.04 ± 7.77 %ID/g for [225Ac]Ac-mcp-M-alb-PSMA at 128 h p.i. and 153.48 ± 37.76 %ID/g at 168 h p.i. for [225Ac]Ac-mcp-D-alb-PSMA) with favorable tumor-to-background ratios. Consequently, a clear histological indication of DNA damage was discovered in the tumor tissues, whereas DNA double-strand break formation in kidney and liver sections was less pronounced. Conclusion: The modification of the PSMA-based 225Ac-radioconjugates with one or two albumin-binding entities resulted in an improved radiopharmacological behavior including a greatly enhanced tumor accumulation combined with a rather low uptake in most non-targeted organs combined with a high excretion via the kidneys.""","""['Falco Reissig', 'Kristof Zarschler', 'Zbynek Novy', 'Milos Petrik', 'Katerina Bendova', 'Daniela Kurfurstova', 'Jan Bouchal', 'Marie-Charlotte Ludik', 'Florian Brandt', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Marta Khoylou', 'Hans-Jürgen Pietzsch', 'Marian Hajduch', 'Constantin Mamat']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', '177Lu-Labeled Albumin-Binder-Conjugated PSMA-Targeting Agents with Extremely High Tumor Uptake and Enhanced Tumor-to-Kidney Absorbed Dose Ratio.', 'Prostate specific membrane antigen binding radiopharmaceuticals: Current data and new concepts.', 'Nanoparticle-Based Radioconjugates for Targeted Imaging and Therapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""
