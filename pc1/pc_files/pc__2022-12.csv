Methods:   A total of 569 patients who underwent mpMRI followed by biopsy or prostatectomy were enrolled in this retrospective study. According to PI-RADS v2.1, three radiologists (A, B, C) from three centers blinded to clinical variables were assigned scores on lesions with simplified bpMRI and then with mpMRI 2 weeks later. Diagnostic performance of simplified bpMRI was compared with mpMRI using histopathology as reference standard.  Results:   For all the three radiologists, the diagnostic sensitivity was significantly higher with mpMRI than with simplified bpMRI (P < 0.001 to P = 0.035); and although specificity was also higher with mpMRI than with simplified bpMRI for radiologist B and radiologist C, it was statistically significant only for radiologist B (P = 0.011, P = 0.359, respectively). On the contrary, for radiologist A, specificity was higher with simplified bpMRI than with mpMRI (P = 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was significantly higher for mpMRI than for simplified bpMRI except for radiologist A (radiologist A: 0.903 vs 0.913, P = 0.1542; radiologist B: 0.861 vs 0.834 P = 0.0013; and radiologist C: 0.884 vs 0.848, P = 0.0003). Interobserver reliability of PI-RADS v2.1 showed good agreement for both simplified bpMRI (kappa = 0.665) and mpMRI (kappa = 0.739).  Conclusion:   Although the detection of csPCa with simplified bpMRI was comparatively lower than that with mpMRI, the diagnostic performance was still high in simplified bpMRI. Our data justify using mpMRI outperforms simplified bpMRI for prostate cancer screening and imply simplified bpMRI as a potential screening tool.""","""['Jihui Song', 'Chenglin Zhao', 'Fei Zhang', 'Yingdi Yuan', 'Lee M Wang', 'Vivek Sah', 'Jun Zhang', 'Wencai Weng', 'Zhenghan Yang', 'Zhenchang Wang', 'Liang Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Abdom Radiol (NY)""","""['Comparison of Biparametric and Multiparametric MRI for Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection With PI-RADS Version 2.1.', 'MRI combined with PSA density in detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in patients with PSA serum levels of 4∼10ng/mL: Biparametric versus multiparametric MRI.', 'Head-to-head comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric MRI of the prostate before robot-assisted transperineal fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Current Status of Biparametric MRI in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Literature Analysis.', 'Clinical impact of abbreviated unenhanced prostate protocols in magnetic resonance imaging.']"""

The early and accurate detection of PCa is critical in reducing mortality and saving lives. Timely diagnosis can improve the chances of successful treatment using advanced technologies. In recent years, nanomaterial-based electrochemical sensing strategies have been adopted in clinical diagnosis, as they allow sensitive early-biomarker detections to be converged with a cost-effective electronic readout system. Herein, we present a flexible electrochemical immunosensor platform for detecting interleukin-6 (IL-6) based on an Au-integrated flexible carbon fiber (Au/CF) electrode prepared via electrodeposition and chemically modiﬁed to capture IL-6 antibodies. Several techniques are used to analyze the prepared Au/CF composite electrodes to confirm their morphology, structure, and elemental composition. Under optimum conditions, the fabricated immunosensor exhibits a wide linear dynamic ranging from 1 fg/mL to 1 μg/mL and a low detection limit of 0.056 fg/mL, with a sensitivity of 62.17 μA/(fg mL-1). The proposed fiber-based immunosensor is used to quantify the concentration of IL-6 in serum samples from clinical PCa patients (T3b and T4 stages), and the results are validated using the commercial Meso Scale Diagnostics (MSD) V-Plex method. The acceptable results yielded by the proposed immunosensor indicate that it can serve as a new platform to realize highly sensitive and cost-effective diagnostic strategies for the early diagnosis of PCa.""","""['Sekar Madhu', 'Jang Hee Han', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Jungil Choi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['Au nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer functionalized wired ethyleneamine-viologen as highly efficient interface for ultra-sensitive α-fetoprotein electrochemical immunosensor.', 'A competitive electrochemical immunosensor for the detection of human interleukin-6 based on the electrically heated carbon electrode and silver nanoparticles functionalized labels.', 'Highly sensitive impedimetric immunosensor for determination of interleukin 6 as a cancer biomarker by using conjugated polymer containing epoxy side groups modified disposable ITO electrode.', 'A highly selective electrochemical immunosensor based on conductive carbon black and star PGMA polymer composite material for IL-8 biomarker detection in human serum and saliva.', 'A Sandwich-Type Electrochemical Immunosensor for Insulin Detection Based on Au-Adhered Cu5 Zn8 Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocubes and AuNP Deposited Nitrogen-Doped Holey Graphene.']"""

This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of various types of CVDs in cancer patients, using the database of the Cardiovascular Medicine in Kurume University Hospital.  Methods and results:   This retrospective cohort study enrolled 11,093 hospitalized patients in Cardiovascular Medicine, Kurume University Hospital from April 2011 to March 2019. Among 11,093 enrolled patients, there were 992 CVDs patients with cancer (8.94%). The five most prevalent forms of cancer were colon cancer, prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, and gastric cancer. Although there was no statistical significance, the comorbidity of breast cancer gradually increased during the study period (2011-2018). In all CVDs, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and uterine cancer tended to increase as comorbidities, while hepatocellular carcinoma and tongue cancer tended to decrease during the observational period. The absolute number of patients with cancer increased in all CVDs, including coronary artery diseases, heart failure, arrhythmia, and pulmonary hypertension.  Conclusions:   The present study demonstrates that the prevalence of cancer in hospitalized CVDs patients was around 10%, and is showing a tendency to increase.

We aimed to report the role of HoLEP in prostate cancer (PCa) patients either on active surveillance with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or for prostate debulking before radiation therapy and the impact on PCa management plans. Methods: Prospectively maintained database in two institutions was reviewed for patients with localized PCa managed by HoLEP with at least a follow-up of 1 year. We assessed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) trends, effect on international prostate symptom score (IPSS) and further management of PCa. Results: Out of >2000 HoLEP patients, 117 patients with a median follow-up of 30 months were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 72.3 (±8.3) years with median (interquartile range, IQR) IPPS of 22 (16-28) and median (IQR) PSA at 7.6 (5.3-14.9) ng/mL. Gleason grade group was 1, 2, 3, and 4 in 47 (73.2%), 32 (27.35%), 7 (5.9%), and 4 (3.4%) patients, respectively. Median (IQR) PSA has significantly dropped to 1.3 (0.6-3.1), 1.4 (0.75-2.9), and 1.7 (0.86-2.75) ng/mL at 6-week, 3-month, and 1-year follow-up, respectively (p < 0.001). IPSS scores post-HoLEP obviously improved with mean (IQR) IPSS of 10 (5-13), 7 (3-12), and 3 (2-5) at 6-week, 3-month, and 1-year, respectively (p < 0.001). Eighty-eight (72%) patients stayed on active surveillance, whereas 27 (23%) patients had radiotherapy ± androgen deprivation therapy for persistently high or relapsing PSA. Within 36 intermediate-risk patients, 15 (41.6%) and patients had radiotherapy, whereas 21 (58.3%) patients continued active surveillance. Conclusions: HoLEP is beneficial in debulking large prostate in PCa patients with bothersome LUTS on active surveillance or before radiotherapy. HoLEP reduces the contribution of large adenoma to PSA level, thus reflecting PSA level better and helping reduce overtreatment.""","""['Mohamed Elsaqa', 'Austen Slade', 'James Lingeman', 'Alex Piroozi', 'Kristofer Wagner', 'Sameer Jhavar', 'Marawan M El Tayeb']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Reoperation After Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate for Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia: Assessment of Risk Factors with Time to Event Analysis.', '""Finding the needle in a haystack"": oncologic evaluation of patients treated for LUTS with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).', 'Which Men Do or Do Not Achieve Long-Term Symptom Relief After Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP): 11 Years of HoLEP Experience.', 'Relationships between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and prostate cancer.', 'Incidental prostate cancer after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate-A narrative review.']"""

All 5637, LNCaP, and PC3 following treatment with exosomes illustrated specific responses with changes in expression of different genes. The increased TP53 and decreased BCL2 expressions were seen in 5637, LNCaP, and PC3. In PC3, OPNb and OPNc have raised more than P53; in LNCap, the increase was in VEGF-c. In 5637 cells, more than TP53 and BCL2 changes, two other genes, VEGFa and B.A.X., have decreased, suggesting exosomes' anti-apoptotic and anti-angiogenic effects. The kidney tumor cell line saw no significant gene expression change in ten targeted genes. MSC-exosomes therapy has augmented some interesting antitumor effects on prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer cell lines.

Hereby, we present the first results of four years of the Merida population-based cancer registry in Mexico.  Methods:   The registry collects data on all new cancers diagnosed since 2015 using both active and passive methods including a total of 104 information sources. Definitions and coding follow international standards. Using CanReg5 software, age-standardized incidence rates (ASR/100,000 person years) were computed by direct method using the world standard population.  Results:   A total of 5684 new cancer cases were registered during 2015-2018, 2321 in males and 3363 in females corresponding to age-adjusted incidence rates (ASR per 100,000) of 128.5, and 153.1, respectively. Most frequent cancers among males were prostate cancer (ASR 29.8), lymphomas (ASR 10.9) and colorectal cancer (ASR 9.7) while among females it was breast cancer (ASR 49.3), cervical cancer (ASR 17.5) and corpus uteri (ASR 11.5). Childhood cancers (0-14 year) represented 2.9% of all cancers, with leukemias accounting for 52% of the new cases. Overall, 87.6% of new cases were microscopically verified.  Conclusions:   The data reported provide information on the cancer profile in Merida. Prostate and breast cancer are the main incident cancers.

Methods and materials:   Patients treated with 5 × 7.25 Gy were identified. Prostate specific antigen-level, physician-reported toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]), and patient-reported outcomes (Quality of Life Questionnaire PR25 and Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 questionnaires) were recorded at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up (FU). Pairwise comparative statistics were conducted to compare outcomes between baseline and FU.  Results:   The study included 425 patients with localized PCa (11.4% low, 82.0% intermediate, and 6.6% high-risk), and 365, 313, and 186 patients reached 3-, 6-, and 12-months FU, respectively. Median prostate specific antigen level declined significantly to 1.2 ng/mL and 0.1 ng/mL at 12 months FU for the nonandrogen deprivation therapy (ADT) and ADT group, respectively. The peak of genitourinary and gastrointestinal CTCAE toxicity was reported at 3 months FU, with 18.7% and 1.7% grade ≥2, respectively.

These complications occur in 54%-80% of patients left with native bladder after diversion, and these patients go on to require completion cystectomy 20%-25% of the time. Rowley et al. at the University of Michigan reported their experience in open simple cystectomy in 2011 in a series of 23 patients. This operation, to our knowledge, has not been previously adapted to the robotic platform despite the growing prevalence of robotic surgery including for complex reconstruction and urinary diversion. Here we report our novel adapted technique of performing robotic simple cystectomy in 2 index patients.  Objective:   To visually demonstrate and report our technique of simple cystectomy, utilizing the robotic platform, including outcomes in 2 index patients.  Methods:   Two index patients are presented, including outcomes: One female with spinal cord injury, smoking and chronic infections in the setting of suprapubic catheter diversion, and one male with multiply failed local treatments including radiation and cryotherapy for prostate cancer that have resulted in chronic fistula, prior Fournier's gangrene, and sympheseal osteomyelitis.  Results:   he operations were completed without difficulty, in an expedient fashion (35-48 minutes) and without significant blood loss (10cc or less). The technique is illustrated in the accompanying video.  Conclusion:   This novel adapted robotically-assisted operation appears to be a rapid and reproducible operation that recapitulates the principles of open surgery with little time or blood loss, thus avoiding the morbidity of radical cystectomy or of delayed secondary operations, while at the same time providing all the benefits inherent to a robotic operation.

As the most abundant component of Cortex Mori, Sanggenon C (SC) is well known to possess bioactivities in tumors, but its mechanism is poorly understood. Consequently, we attempted to investigate whether SC could modulate circular RNA(s) levels and hence anti-PCa development. We found that SC dramatically promoted cell apoptosis and induced G0/G1 phase arrest in PCa cell lines via the circHMGCS1-miR-205-5p-ErBB3 axis. In brief, circHMGCS1 is highly expressed in PCa and is positively correlated with the degree of malignancy. Over-expression of circHMGCS1 is not only associated with the proliferation of PCa cells but also blocks SC-induced pro-apoptotic effects. As a verified sponge of circHMGCS1, miR-205-5p is down-regulated in PCa tumors, which negatively regulates PCa cell proliferation by modulating ErBB3 expression. After miR-205-5p mimics or inhibitors were used to transfect PCa cells, the effects of circHMGCS1 OE and SC on PCa cells were completely diminished. Similar to miR-205-5p inhibitors, siErBB3 could oppose SC-triggered pro-apoptotic effects on PCa cells. All these results were confirmed in vivo. Together, SC exerts its anti-tumor effects on PCa by inhibiting circHMGCS1 expression and results in the latter losing the ability to sponge miR-205-5p. Subsequently, unfettered miR-205-5p could mostly down-regulate ErBB3 expression by binding to the 5'UTR of ErBB3 mRNA, which eventually resulted in PCa cell cycle arrest and pro-apoptosis.""","""['Jie Li', 'Xinyue Cao', 'Ting Chu', 'Kehao Lin', 'Lei Chen', 'Junlin Lv', 'Yujun Tan', 'Miaomiao Chen', 'Minjing Li', 'Kejun Wang', 'Qiusheng Zheng', 'Defang Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Pharmacol Res""","""['Tumor-Suppressive Function of miR-30d-5p in Prostate Cancer Cell Proliferation and Migration by Targeting NT5E.', 'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'LncRNA LOXL1-AS1/miR-let-7a-5p/EGFR-related pathway regulates the doxorubicin resistance of prostate cancer DU-145 cells.', 'miR-214-5p inhibits human prostate cancer proliferation and migration through regulating CRMP5.', 'Toad venom-derived bufadienolides and their therapeutic application in prostate cancers: Current status and future directions.']"""

Methods:   A cross-sectional study was performed. We obtained every PSA test made in the health zone from 2018 to 2020, and classified them retrospectively as screening (PSAc) or not according to pre-established criteria, reviewing electronic health records. Testing rates were calculated by centres and clinical specialities. The standard population was provided by the city register of inhabitants (VM70). Cost estimation was made using our health system's price list.  Results:   Two thousand and thirty six PSA, of 888 men ≥ 70 years old were obtained, and 350 met screening classification criteria. Six adenocarcinomas were diagnosed from those tests. We estimated 76.07 PSAc/1000 VM70-year from any centre, 1.45 tests for each screened individual, and 15.71% prevalence. The standard population was 1534 men (mean 2018-2020, SD 45.37). Patients who were screened (median age 75, SD 4.04) were younger than those not screened. We estimated a total screening test cost of 9,751 €.  Conclusions:   The epidemiology and cost of PSA screening tests to men ≥ 70 years old are reported, both in primary health care and in the hospital.

Methods:   The South African HIV Cancer Match study is a nationwide cohort of PWH based on a linkage between HIV-related laboratory records from the National Health Laboratory Service and cancer diagnoses from the National Cancer Registry for 2004-2014. We included PWH who had HIV-related tests on separate days. Using natural splines, we modeled cancer incidence rates as a function of age.  Results:   We included 5 222 827 PWH with 29 580 incident cancer diagnoses-most commonly cervical cancer (n = 7418), Kaposi sarcoma (n = 6380), and breast cancer (n = 2748). In young PWH, the incidence rates for infection-related cancers were substantially higher than for infection-unrelated cancers. At age 40 years, the most frequent cancer was cervical cancer in female and Kaposi sarcoma in male PWH. Thereafter, the rates of infection-unrelated cancers increased steeply, particularly among male PWH, where prostate cancer became the most frequent cancer type at older age. Whereas Kaposi sarcoma rates peaked at 34 years (101/100 000 person-years) in male PWH, cervical cancer remained the most frequent cancer among older female PWH.  Conclusions:   Infection-related cancers are common in PWH in South Africa, but rates of infection-unrelated cancers overtook those of infection-related cancers after age 54 years in the overall study population. As PWH in South Africa live longer, prevention and early detection of infection-unrelated cancers becomes increasingly important.

Resistance to anoikis, a form of cell death initiated by cell detachment from the surrounding extracellular matrix, is one of the cellular processes critical for PCa progression towards aggressive disease. Therefore, further understanding of anoikis regulation in PCa might provide therapeutic opportunities. Here, we discover that PCa tumours with concomitant inhibition of two tumour suppressor phosphatases, PP2A and PTEN, are particularly aggressive, having < 50% 5-year secondary-therapy-free patient survival. Functionally, overexpression of PME-1, a methylesterase for the catalytic PP2A-C subunit, inhibits anoikis in PTEN-deficient PCa cells. In vivo, PME-1 inhibition increased apoptosis in in ovo PCa tumour xenografts, and attenuated PCa cell survival in zebrafish circulation. Molecularly, PME-1-deficient PC3 cells display increased trimethylation at lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3 (H3K9me3 and H3K27me3), a phenotype known to correlate with increased apoptosis sensitivity.

This study was designed to explore the effects of ulinastatin (UTI) on the malignant progression of prostate cancer and its relevant mechanism of action. Human prostate cancer cell line PC-3 was applied to investigate the anticancer activity of UTI. PC-3 cells were treated with increasing concentrations (400, 800, and 1600 U/ml) of UTI. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were determined by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, wound-healing, Transwell assay, and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The expression level of corresponding proteins was detected by western blot. In addition, PC-3 cells were pretreated with RhoA agonist CN03 (1 μg/ml) or NLRP3 agonist nigericin (10 μM) before UTI treatment, and the cellular behaviors above were detected again. It was demonstrated that UTI significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion but promoted apoptosis in PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Meanwhile, UTI could block RhoA/ROCK/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway in PC-3 cells, and the activation of RhoA or NLRP3 inflammasome partly weakened the impacts of UTI on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis in PC-3 cells, respectively. In summary, our study demonstrated the antitumor activity of UTI against prostate cancer by regulating RhoA/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, providing a promising candidate drug for the therapeutic treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Zhiguang Liu', 'Xiaochun Zhu', 'Chenglin Xu', 'Feng Min', 'Guofeng Yu', 'Chuhong Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Drug Dev Res""","""['Astragaloside IV attenuates sepsis-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction via suppressing RhoA/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling.', 'Activation of NLRP3 inflammasome promotes the proliferation and migration of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Effects of the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil on the invasion, migration, and apoptosis of human prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cells.', 'Therapeutic Potential of Pharmacological Targeting NLRP3 Inflammasome Complex in Cancer.', 'Polydatin suppresses proliferation and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer cells by inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation via NF-κB pathway.', 'Optimization of Neferine Purification Based on Response Surface Methodology and Its Anti-Metastasis Mechanism on HepG2 Cells.']"""

The high abundance of cancer-associated 5-mC alterations permits parallel and highly sensitive assessment of multiple 5-mC biomarkers. Here, we performed genome-wide 5-mC profiling in the plasma of metastatic ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. We established a strategy to identify ALK-specific 5-mC changes from cfDNA and demonstrated the suitability of the identified markers for cancer detection, prognosis, and therapy monitoring.  Methods:   Longitudinal plasma samples (n = 79) of 21 ALK-positive NSCLC patients and 13 healthy donors were collected alongside 15 ALK-positive tumor tissue and 10 healthy lung tissue specimens. All plasma and tissue samples were analyzed by cell-free DNA methylation immunoprecipitation sequencing to generate genome-wide 5-mC profiles. Information on genomic alterations (i.e., somatic mutations/fusions and copy number alterations) determined in matched plasma samples was available from previous studies.  Results:   We devised a strategy that identified tumor-specific 5-mC biomarkers by reducing 5-mC background signals derived from hematopoietic cells. This was followed by differential methylation analysis (cases vs. controls) and biomarker validation using 5-mC profiles of ALK-positive tumor tissues. The resulting 245 differentially methylated regions were enriched for lung adenocarcinoma-specific 5-mC patterns in TCGA data and indicated transcriptional repression of several genes described to be silenced in NSCLC (e.g., PCDH10, TBX2, CDO1, and HOXA9). Additionally, 5-mC-based tumor DNA (5-mC score) was highly correlated with other genomic alterations in cell-free DNA (Spearman, ρ > 0.6), while samples with high 5-mC scores showed significantly shorter overall survival (log-rank p = 0.025). Longitudinal 5-mC scores reflected radiologic disease assessments and were significantly elevated at disease progression compared to the therapy start (p = 0.0023). In 7 out of 8 instances, rising 5-mC scores preceded imaging-based evaluation of disease progression.  Conclusion:   We demonstrated a strategy to identify 5-mC biomarkers from the plasma of cancer patients and integrated them into a quantitative measure of cancer-associated 5-mC alterations.

For socioeconomic status (SES), we used the zip code-based Economic Innovation Group Distressed Community Index (DCI) which classifies into five even distress tiers: prosperous, comfortable, mid-tier, at-risk, or distressed. Low SES was defined as those with a DCI Distress tier of at-risk or distressed. We compared values between the two retention and withdrawal groups using t-test, chi-square test, and logistic regression analysis.  Results:   Of 273 men screened, 123 men were enrolled. Among them, 86.2% (106/123) retained through the study whereas 13.8% (17/123) withdrew from the study. The mean (SD) age was 64 (6.4) years. Overall, 31.7% (39/123) were Hispanics and 24.3% (30/123) were African Americans. The median (IQR) DCI score was 34 (10.3, 68.1) and 30.8% (38/123) of patients belonged to low SES. The median DCI score in participants who retained in the study was statistically similar to those who withdrew from the study (p=0.4). Neither the DCI tiers (p=0.7) nor the low SES (p=0.9) were associated with participants' retention or withdrawal of the study.

However, recent reports indicate a high rate of unspecific bone uptake (UBU) with 18F-PSMA-1007, which may lead to a false-positive diagnosis. UBU has not been evaluated thoroughly. Here, we evaluate the frequency of UBU and bone metastases separately for 18F-PSMA-1007 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 in biochemical recurrence (interindividual comparison). Additionally, we investigate UBU seen in 18F-PSMA-1007 through follow-up examinations (intraindividual comparison) using 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, bone scintigraphy, and MRI. Methods: First, all patients (n = 383) who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET between January 2020 and December 2020 and all patients (n = 409) who underwent 18F-PSMA-1007 PET between January 2020 and November 2021 due to biochemical recurrence were included for an interindividual comparison of bone metastases and UBU rate. In a second approach, we regarded all patients with UBU in 18F-PSMA-1007, characterized by focal bone uptake with an SUVmax > 4 and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 5 ng/mL, who underwent additional 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (n = 17) (interindividual comparison). Of these, 12 patients also had bone scintigraphy and whole-body MRI within a 1- to 5-wk interval. Bone uptake seen on 18F-PSMA-1007 but not on any of the other 4 modalities (CT, MRI [n = 1], bone scanning, and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET) was recorded as false-positive. Results: Patients scanned with 18F-PSMA-1007 PET had a significantly higher rate of UBU than those scanned with 68Ga-PSMA-11 (140 vs. 64; P < 0.001); however, the rate of bone metastases was not significantly different (72 vs. 64; P = 0.7). In the intraindividual comparison group, workup by CT, MRI, bone scanning, and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET resulted in a positive predictive value for 18F-PSMA-1007 focal bone uptake (mean SUVmax, 6.1 ± 2.9) per patient and per lesion of 8.3% and 3.6%, respectively. Conclusion: In patients with PSA ≤ 5 ng/mL and SUV > 4 at biochemical recurrence, most 18F-PSMA-1007 focal bone uptake is likely to be false-positive and therefore due to UBU. In the case of low clinical likelihood of metastatic disease, 18F-PSMA-1007 bone uptake without morphologic surrogate should be assessed carefully with regard to localization and clinical context. However, the rate of bone metastases was not higher with 18F-PSMA-1007 in the clinical routine, indicating that experienced reporting physicians adjust for UBU findings.""","""['Robert Seifert', 'Tugce Telli', 'Marcel Opitz', 'Francesco Barbato', 'Christoph Berliner', 'Michael Nader', 'Lale Umutlu', 'Martin Stuschke', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Wolfgang P Fendler']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT derived quantitative volumetric tumor parameters for classification and evaluation of therapeutic response of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.', 'Comparison of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT with 18FNaF PET/CT in the evaluation of bone metastases in metastatic prostate cancer patients prior to radionuclide therapy.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'A Retrospective Multicenter Analysis of the Incidence of Bone-Only Disease at PSMA PET/CT in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Methods:   In total, 106 mHSPC patients treated with luteinizing-hormone releasing-hormone (LHRH) agonists were retrospectively analyzed between March 2018 and August 2021. Testosterone levels in serum samples were quantitated using an LC-MS/MS assay. In a subset of patients, IA (Roche Cobas Pro) values were compared with LC-MS/MS results. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models.  Results:   Median PFS was shorter for high testosterone levels (>0.231 nmol/L, 18.4 v. 42.6 months, HR 1.7, p = 0.018). Low testosterone levels and a PSA response below 4 ng/mL was associated with longer median PFS (46.2 months) than the remaining combinations (13.8-19.3 months, 3.4-5.8, overall p < 0.01). In 67 patients, testosterone levels below the median remained associated with longer PFS, whereas IA measurements did not show a similar difference.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that high castration testosterone levels measured by LC-MS/MS is an independent response predictor for mHSPC patients.""","""['Lennart J van Winden', 'Mirthe Lanfermeijer', 'Vincent Dezentje', 'Andries M Bergman', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Huub H van Rossum']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Chim Acta""","""['Lower testosterone levels with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy than with surgical castration: new insights attained by mass spectrometry.', 'Testosterone analysis in castrated prostate cancer patients: suitability of the castration cut-off and analytical accuracy of the present-day clinical immunoassays.', 'Serum Testosterone Levels in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Agonist Therapy.', 'Risk of Testosterone Flare in the Era of the Saturation Model: One More Historical Myth.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R)-dependent macrophages promote cGVHD fibrosis, and their elimination in preclinical studies ameliorated cGVHD. Axatilimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits CSF-1R signaling and restrains macrophage development.  Patients and methods:   This phase I (phI)/phase II (phII) open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03604692) evaluated safety, tolerability, and efficacy of axatilimab in patients age ≥ 6 years with active cGVHD after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapy lines. Primary objectives in phI were to identify the optimal biologic and recommended phII dose and in phII to evaluate the overall (complete and partial) response rate (ORR) at the start of treatment cycle 7.  Results:   Forty enrolled patients (17 phI; 23 phII) received at least one axatilimab dose. In phI, a dose of 3 mg/kg given once every 4 weeks met the optimal biologic dose definition. Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred at the 3 mg/kg dose given once every 2 weeks. At least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was observed in 30 patients with grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in eight patients, the majority known on-target effects of CSF-1R inhibition. No cytomegalovirus reactivations occurred. With the 50% ORR at cycle 7 day 1, the phII cohort met the primary efficacy end point. Furthermore, the ORR in the first six cycles, an end point supporting regulatory approvals, was 82%. Responses were seen in all affected organs regardless of prior therapy. Fifty-eight percent of patients reported significant improvement in cGVHD-related symptoms using the Lee Symptom Scale. On-target activity of axatilimab was suggested by the decrease in skin CSF-1R-expressing macrophages.  Conclusion:   Targeting profibrotic macrophages with axatilimab is a therapeutically promising novel strategy with a favorable safety profile for refractory cGVHD.""","""['Carrie L Kitko', 'Mukta Arora', 'Zachariah DeFilipp', 'Mohammad Abu Zaid', 'Antonio Di Stasi', 'Vedran Radojcic', 'Courtney B Betts', 'Lisa M Coussens', 'Michael L Meyers', 'Hope Qamoos', 'Peter Ordentlich', 'Vinit Kumar', 'Christine Quaranto', 'Aaron Schmitt', 'Yu Gu', 'Bruce R Blazar', 'Trent P Wang', 'Amandeep Salhotra', 'Iskra Pusic', 'Madan Jagasia', 'Stephanie J Lee']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['IL6-receptor antibody tocilizumab as salvage therapy in severe chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: a retrospective analysis.', 'A Phase I Trial of SYK Inhibition with Fostamatinib in the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease.', 'An Open-Label, Single-Arm, Multicenter Study of Ibrutinib in Japanese Patients With Steroid-dependent/Refractory Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease.', 'A critical review of belumosudil in adult and pediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease.', 'Belumosudil for chronic graft-versus-host disease.']"""

Recent studies suggest that the temporal order in which somatic mutations accumulate during cancer progression is important. Single-cell sequencing (SCS) provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect that the mutation order has on cancer progression and treatment effect. However, the error rates associated with single-cell sequencing are known to be high, which greatly complicates the task. We propose a novel method for inferring the order in which somatic mutations arise within an individual tumor using noisy data from single-cell sequencing. Our method incorporates models at two levels in that the evolutionary process of somatic mutation within the tumor is modeled along with the technical errors that arise from the single-cell sequencing data collection process. Through analyses of simulations across a wide range of realistic scenarios, we show that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches for identifying mutation order. Most importantly, our method provides a unique means to capture and quantify the uncertainty in the inferred mutation order along a given phylogeny. We illustrate our method by analyzing data from colorectal and prostate cancer patients, in which our method strengthens previously reported mutation orders. Our work is an important step towards producing meaningful prediction of mutation order with high accuracy and measuring the uncertainty of predicted mutation order in cancer patients, with the potential to lead to new insights about the evolutionary trajectories of cancer.""","""['Yuan Gao', 'Jeff Gaither', 'Julia Chifman', 'Laura Kubatko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS Comput Biol""","""['Identifying restrictions in the order of accumulation of mutations during tumor progression: effects of passengers, evolutionary models, and sampling.', 'gpps: an ILP-based approach for inferring cancer progression with mutation losses from single cell data.', 'Cancer evolution: mathematical models and computational inference.', 'Accurate reconstruction of the temporal order of mutations in neoplastic progression.', 'Order Matters: The Order of Somatic Mutations Influences Cancer Evolution.']"""

Mutations of the androgen receptor (AR) are associated with the development of prostate cancer (PCa) by responding to non-androgenic hormones, and the lack of annotations in their responsiveness to hormone ligands remains a daunting challenge. Here, we have used a yeast reporter system to quickly evaluate the responsiveness of all fifty clinical AR mutations to a variety of steroidal ligands including dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 17β-estradiol (E2), progesterone (PROG), and cyproterone acetate (CPA). Based on an AR-driven reporter that synthesizes histidine, a basic amino acid required for yeast survival and propagation, the yeast reporter system enabling clonal selection was further empowered by combining with a random DNA mutagenesis library to simulate the natural evolution of AR gene under the selective pressures of steroidal ligands. In a time-frame of 1-2 weeks, 19 AR mutants were identified, in which 11 AR mutants were validated for activation by tested steroidal compounds. The high efficiency of our artificial evolution strategy was further evidenced by a sequential selection that enabled the discovery of multipoint AR mutations and evolution directions under the pressure of steroidal ligands. In summary, our designer yeast is a portable reporter module that can be readily adapted to streamline high-throughput AR-compound screening, used as a PCa clinical reference, and combined with additional bioassay systems to further extend its potential.""","""['Haoran Zhang', 'Lu Zhang', 'Shaoyong Chen', 'Mingdong Yao', 'Zhenyi Ma', 'Yingjin Yuan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""['Modelling AR mutations.', 'Simulating androgen receptor selection in designer yeast.', 'Isolation and characterization of the androgen receptor mutants with divergent transcriptional activity in response to hydroxyflutamide.', 'Activation of rat androgen receptor by androgenic ligands is unaffected by antiandrogens in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.', 'Androgen-receptor gene structure and function in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor mutations in carcinoma of the prostate: significance for endocrine therapy.']"""

Herein, we investigated the effect of cholesterol on androgen receptor (AR) coactivators expression and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Herein, we monitored the expression of AR coactivators (SRC-1, 2, 3 and PCAF) genes in PC-3 cells exposed to 2µg/mL of cholesterol for 8 hours by qPCR. We also performed cell migration at 0, 8, 24, 48 and 72h and flow cytometry assays (viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle) after a 24h exposure. Immunofluorescence assay was performed to evaluate the protein expression of the AR coactivators. Additionally, in vivo experiments were conducted using 22 male NOD/SCID mice. Mice were fed a standard (Control) or hypercholesterolemic (HCOL) diet for 21 days and then subcutaneously implanted with PC-3 cells. The tumor volume was calculated every two days, and after four weeks, the tumors were resected, weighed, and the serum lipid profile was measured. We also measured the intratumoral lipid profile and AR coactivators gene and protein expression by qPCR and Western Blot, respectively. Intratumor testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) concentrations were determined using ELISA.  Results:   Cholesterol up-regulated the gene expression of coactivators SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and PCAF, increasing AR expression in PC-3 cells. Next, cholesterol-supplemented PC-3 cells exhibited increased cell migration and altered cell cycle phases, leading to changes in proliferation and reduced apoptosis. We found that SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3 and PCAF proteins co-localized in the nucleus of cholesterol-supplemented cells and co-associate with AR. In the in vivo model, the hypercholesterolemic (HCOL) group displayed higher serum total and intratumoral cholesterol levels, increased testosterone and dihydrotestosterone concentrations, and up-regulated AR coactivator expression. The tumor volume of the HCOL group was significantly higher than the control group.  Conclusion:   Our findings revealed that increased nuclear translocation of the coactivators leads to up-regulated AR gene and protein expression, potentially influencing tumor progression.

Design:   population-based descriptive study.  Setting and participants:   incident cancer cases diagnosed in 2010-2014, with follow-up to 2018, from 17 Italian cancer registries (covering 31% of the national population; 43% of the population residing in the North-Centre of the country and 8% of the population living in the South and Islands).  Main outcome measures:   age-standardized 5-year net survival (NS) by cancer site or type, sex, age, and geographical area.  Results:   NS of patients aged ≥15 years with breast, prostate, colorectal, and lung cancers was higher in the North-Centre than in the South and Islands. The overall survival of people diagnosed with cancer in childhood (0-14 years) was 84.3%, with similar values among the geographical macro-areas and between males and females. Women with breast cancer within the current target age of the screening programmes and those in the younger age groups (45-49 years) show similar survival values; the same is true for women with colorectal cancer. In both cases, survival decreased in the age groups after the age of cessation of screening programmes. Survival of patients with tobacco smoke-associated cancers varies according to cancer site (from 11.1% for patients with pancreatic cancer to 79.7% for those with bladder cancer). For most cancer sites, women have higher survival than men.  Conclusions:   for adults, a geographical survival gap persists.

We relied on a large population-based cohort to address epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and treatment of CDC patients. We also tested survival in the overall cohort, as well as in stage-specific fashion.  Materials and methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (2004-2018) database, we identified 399 CDC patients. Based on Kaplan-Meier plots survival estimates, conditional survival rates were derived according to disease stage. Cox regression models tested for predictors of cancer specific mortality (CSM).  Results:   Overall, 273 (68.4%) patients were male, 236 (59.2%) had T3-4 stages, 148 (37.1%) had lymph node invasion, and 156 (39.1%) had distant metastases at initial diagnosis. Nephrectomy alone was commonest in stage I-II (n = 91/99, 92%) and III (n = 94/116, 81%). Combination of both nephrectomy and systemic therapy was commonest in stage IV (n = 62/172, 36%). In the overall cohort, median cancer specific survival was 18 months. Provided a disease-free interval of 24 months, five-year Kaplan-Meier estimated survival at diagnosis increased from 74.2 to 91.0% in stage I-II, from 31.1 to 65.3% in stage III, and from 6.3 to 34.1% in stage IV. In multivariable Cox regression models addressing CSM, systemic therapy (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.47, P = 0.020), nephrectomy (HR: 0.37, P < 0.001) and combination of both (HR: 0.28, P < 0.001) exhibited a strong protective effect.

Further, the analysis of protein-protein interactions revealed strong intrinsic relationships between TPP-related genes. In addition, the TPP-based prognostic prediction model demonstrated promising results in predicting the prognosis of patients with gliomas. Several TPP-related genes were closely related to glioma patients' overall survival rates. The proliferation and migration abilities of glioma cells were further demonstrated to be significantly enhanced by TPP. In a bioinformatics analysis, we also discovered that melatonin is highly correlated with the presence of TPP and gliomas. According to the cell proliferation and migration assays, exposure to melatonin and TPP inhibited the ability of glioma cells to invade compared with the TPP group.""","""['Wanyun Zhang', 'Guoping Song']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ecotoxicol Environ Saf""","""['Comprehensive analysis of triphenyl phosphate: An environmental explanation of colorectal cancer progression.', 'Low concentration triphenyl phosphate fuels proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.', 'Genetic comprehension of organophosphate flame retardants, an emerging threat to prostate cancer.', 'Plant accumulation and transformation of brominated and organophosphate flame retardants: A review.', 'A review of organophosphorus flame retardants (OPFRs): occurrence, bioaccumulation, toxicity, and organism exposure.', 'High-throughput screening of toxicants that modulate extravillous trophoblast migration.']"""

A (rat) bioassay-guided physicochemical fractionation using ovine materials yielded via Edman degradation a 14-residue amino acid (aa) sequence. As a 14mer synthetic peptide (EPL001) this displayed antiproliferative and reproduction-modulating activity, while representing only a part of the native polypeptide. Even more unexpectedly, a scrambled-sequence control peptide (EPL030) did likewise.  Methods:   Reproduction has been investigated in the nematode Steinernema siamkayai, using a fermentation system supplemented with different concentrations of exogenous hexapeptides. Peptide structure-activity relationships have also been studied using prostate cancer and other mammalian cells in vitro, with peptides in solution or immobilized, and via the use of mammalian assays in vivo and through molecular modelling.  Results:   Reproduction increased (x3) in the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema siamkayai after exposure to one synthetic peptide (IEPVFT), while fecundity was reduced (x0.5) after exposure to another (KLKMNG), both effects being dose-dependent. These hexamers are opposite ends of the synthetic peptide KLKMNGKNIEPVFT (EPL030). Bioactivity is unexpected as EPL030 is a control compound, based on a scrambled sequence of the test peptide MKPLTGKVKEFNNI (EPL001). EPL030 and EPL001 are both bioinformatically obscure, having no convincing matches to aa sequences in the protein databases. EPL001 has antiproliferative effects on human prostate cancer cells and rat bone marrow cells in vitro. Intracerebroventricular infusion of EPL001 in sheep was associated with elevated growth hormone in peripheral blood and reduced prolactin. The highly dissimilar EPL001 and EPL030 nonetheless have the foregoing biological effects in common in mammalian systems, while being divergently pro- and anti-fecundity respectively in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Peptides up to a 20mer have also been shown to inhibit the proliferation of human cancer and other mammalian cells in vitro, with reproductive upregulation demonstrated previously in fish and frogs, as well as nematodes. EPL001 encodes the sheep neuroendocrine prohormone secretogranin II (sSgII), as deduced on the basis of immunoprecipitation using an anti-EPL001 antibody, with bespoke bioinformatics. Six sSgII residues are key to EPL001's bioactivity: MKPLTGKVKEFNNI. A stereospecific bimodular tri-residue signature is described involving simultaneous accessibility for binding of the side chains of two specific trios of amino acids, MKP & VFN. An evolutionarily conserved receptor is conceptualised having dimeric binding sites, each with ligand-matching bimodular stereocentres. The bioactivity of the 14mer control peptide EPL030 and its hexapeptide progeny is due to the fortuitous assembly of subsets of the novel hormonal motif, MKPVFN, a default reproductive and tissue-building OFF signal.""","""['John E Hart', 'Sharad Mohan', 'Keith G Davies', 'Ben Ferneyhough', 'Iain J Clarke', 'John A Hunt', 'Steve D Shnyder', 'Christopher R Mundy', 'David R Howlett', 'Russell P Newton']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mysterious inhibitory cell regulator investigated and found likely to be secretogranin II related.', 'Epitope mapping of an uncertain endogenous antigen implies secretogranin II peptide splicing.', 'Inhibition of compensatory renal growth by the N-terminus of a sheep-derived peptide.', 'The world of beta- and gamma-peptides comprised of homologated proteinogenic amino acids and other components.', 'Ghrelin and reproduction: a novel signal linking energy status and fertility?']"""

Two hundred seventy-two consecutive participants were admitted who underwent a prostate biopsy. The UE-PSA expression was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The predictive power and clinical value of UE-PSA was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and waterfall plots. UE-PSA was upregulated in PCa compared to benign patients (P < .001) and csPCa compared to nsPCa plus benign patients (P < .001). UE-PSA achieved an AUC of 0.953 (0.905-0.989) in distinguishing PCa from benign patients and an AUC of 0.879 (0.808-0.941) in predicting csPCa from nsPCa plus benign patients.

In this issue of the JCI, Sena et al. developed a gene signature indicative of high AR activity to predict patient response to BAT, including a decline in both serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and tumor volume. Preclinical models showed that AR-mediated suppression of MYC, known to drive PC, was associated with decreased cell growth following SPA treatment.

Materials and methods:   We prospectively assessed post-diagnostic zinc supplementation in relation to prostate cancer survival among 5,788 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2019). We used Cox regression models to estimate the multivariable hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of lethal prostate cancer (distant metastases or prostate cancer-specific death) and all-cause mortality according to post-diagnostic zinc supplement use and dosage.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 11 years, we documented 527 lethal prostate cancer events and 3,198 all-cause deaths. Fifteen percent of men reported zinc supplement use post-diagnosis. Compared to nonusers, post-diagnostic zinc supplement use was associated suggestively with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (HR [95% CI], 0.82 [0.60-1.13]) and significantly with all-cause mortality (0.84 [0.74-0.96]). The inverse association was mostly observed among men who used post-diagnostic zinc supplements of 1-24 mg/d (lethal prostate cancer: 0.55 [0.32-0.96]; all-cause mortality: 0.77 [0.64-0.93]), while higher dosage did not show a lower risk.  Conclusions:   Post-diagnostic low-dose zinc supplement use among nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients was associated with lower risk of lethal prostate cancer and all-cause mortality.

Chemotherapy is an effective treatment for advanced PCa but has limitations in terms of efficacy, side effects, multidrug resistance, and high treatment costs. Therefore, new treatment modalities for PCa need to be explored and improved.  Methods:   R language and GEO database were used to obtain differentially expressed genes for PCa single-cell sequencing. TCMSP, STITCH, SwissTargetPrediction, and PubChem databases were used to obtain the active ingredients and targets of Pueraria lobata (PL). Next, Cytoscape software was used to draw the interactive network diagram of ""drug-active component-target pathway."" Based on the STRING database, the protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were applied for the genes. Molecular docking was used to visualize the drug-target interaction via AutoDock Vina and PyMOL. Finally, prognosis-related genes were found by survival analysis, and Protein Atlas was used for validation.  Results:   Four active components and 31 target genes were obtained through the regulatory network of PL. Functional enrichment analysis showed that PL played a pharmacological role in the treatment of PCa by regulating the metabolic processes of reactive oxygen species, response to steroid hormones, and oxidative stress as well as IL-17 signaling pathway, PCa, and estrogen signaling pathway. Single-cell data showed that AR, MIF, HSP90B1, and MAOA genes were highly expressed, and molecular docking analysis showed that representative components had a strong affinity with receptor proteins. Survival analysis found that APOE, CA2, IGFBP3, MIF, F10, and NR3C1 could predict progression-free survival (PFS), and some of them could be validated in PCa.  Conclusion:   In this paper, a drug-active ingredient-target pathway network of PL at the single-cell level of PCa was constructed, and the findings revealed that it acted on genes such as AR, MIF, HSP90B1, and MAOA to regulate several biological processes and related signaling pathways to interfere with the occurrence and development of PCa.

Methods:   Adult cancer cases (aged 15 to 99 years) for nine cancer types diagnosed between 1998 and 2017, with follow-up to 2018, were obtained from the RPCC. The 5-year age-standardized net survival estimates (NS) were estimated using the Pohar-Perme.

Limited evidence exists regarding the causality of these relationships. Using a genetic variant (rs4988235) near the lactase gene (LCT) locus that proxies milk consumption, we conducted a comprehensive survey to assess potential causal relationships between milk consumption and 12 types of cancer.  Methods:   Our analyses were conducted using white British participants of the UK Biobank (n = up to 255,196), the FinnGen cohort (up to 260,405), and available cancer consortia. We included cancers with previous evidence of an association with milk consumption in observational studies, as well as cancers common in both UK Biobank and FinnGen populations (>1000 cases). We evaluated phenotypic associations of milk intake and cancer incidence in the UK Biobank, and then used a Mendelian randomisation (MR) approach to assess causality in the UK Biobank, FinnGen consortium, and combined analyses incorporating additional consortia data for five cancers. In MR meta-analyses, case numbers for cancers of breast, ovary, uterus, cervix, prostate, bladder and urinary tract, colorectum, and lung ranged between 6000 and 148,000 cases, and between 780 and 1342 cases for cancers of the liver, mouth, stomach and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.  Results:   In observational analyses, milk consumption was associated with higher risk of bladder and urinary tract cancer (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.47), but not with any other cancer. This association was not confirmed in the MR analysis, and genetically predicted milk consumption showed a significant association only with lower risk of colorectal cancer (0.89, 0.81-0.98 per additional 50 g/day). In the MR analyses conducted among individual cohorts, genetically predicted milk consumption provided evidence for an association with lower colorectal cancer in the FinnGen cohort (0.85, 0.74-0.97), and in the UK Biobank greater risk of female breast cancer (1.12, 1.03-1.23), and uterine cancer in pre-menopausal females (3.98, 1.48-10.7).

In this substudy, relugolix, an oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, was evaluated in combination with apalutamide.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the approved standard maintenance dose of relugolix in combination with apalutamide sustains castrate testosterone levels (< 50 ng/dL).  Patients and methods:   Twelve patients with HR-LPC who met all the main study criteria were included in the substudy. Patients received relugolix monotherapy for 2 weeks (loading dose [360 mg] at Day - 14 then 120 mg/day daily until Day - 1), then daily relugolix (120 mg) with apalutamide (240 mg) from Day 1 to Day 28. Endpoints were rate of maintained castration (testosterone < 50 ng/dL) through Day 28 (primary) and safety (secondary).  Results:   All 12 patients received relugolix and apalutamide and achieved castrate testosterone levels after 2-week relugolix monotherapy (median testosterone 348.5 ng/dL and 8.7 ng/dL at Days - 14 and - 1).

Methods:   The SEER Prostate with Watchful Waiting database was used to identify men diagnosed with NCCN low or FIR PCa, between 2010 and 2015, managed with AS. FIR patients were subdivided into three subgroups, based on their intermediate risk factor: grade group two (GG2), PSA 10-20 ng/ml or cT2b-c disease. Cumulative incidence function curves with other-cause mortality as the competing risk were utilized. Predictors of PCa mortality were assessed using multivariable regression analysis with semi-parametric proportional hazards modeling.  Results:   Among 70,871 patients, 48,127 (67.9%) had low and 22,744 (32.1%) had FIR disease. Median patient age was 64.0 years, and median PSA was 5.70 ng/ml. Median follow-up was 49.0 months. There were 166 (0.2%) PCa and 3,176 (4.48%) other-cause mortalities. The 5-year mortality rates in the low and FIR cohorts overall were 0.29% and 0.28%, respectively (p = 0.64). Within the FIR cohort, the corresponding rates were highest in the PSA 10-20 ng/ml subgroup at 0.73%, followed by 0.32% for GG2 FIR and 0.052% for cT2b-c FIR disease (p < 0.001).

Methods:   Five cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus databases were used to perform gene set variation analysis (GSVA) between nonrecurrent and recurrent PCa patients. We obtained the intersection of pathway enrichment results and extracted the corresponding gene list. LASSO Cox regression analysis was used to identify recurrence-free survival (RFS)-related significant genes and establish an RFS prediction gene signature and nomogram. MTT and colony formation assays were conducted to validate our findings.  Results:   The E2F signaling pathway was activated in recurrent PCa patients compared to nonrecurrent patients. We established an E2F-related gene signature for RFS prediction based on the four identified E2F-related genes (CDKN2C, CDKN3, RACGAP1, and RRM2) using LASSO Cox regression in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) cohort. The risk score of each patient in MSKCC was calculated based on the expression levels of CDKN2C, CDKN3, RACGAP1, and RRM2. PCa patients with low-risk scores exhibited higher RFS than those with high-risk scores. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis validated the good performance and prognostic accuracy of the E2F-related gene signature, which was validated in the TCGA-prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) cohort. Compared to patients with low Gleason scores and early T stages, PCa patients with high Gleason scores and advanced T stages had high-risk scores. Moreover, the E2F-related gene signature-based nomogram yielded good performance in RFS prediction. Functional experiments further confirmed these results.

CCK-8 assay, colony formation experiment, Transwell migration and invasion experiments were performed to prove that the up-regulation of LINC00852 could promote the proliferation, migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro. Xenograft tumors experiments in nude mice confirmed that up-regulation of LINC00852 promoted the proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vivo. Bioinformatics predictions and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-29a-3p binds to the 3'-untranslated region of JARID2, and the enhancement of miR-29a-3p could reverse the effect of LINC00852 overexpression in vitro. Moreover, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot showed that LINC00852 could regulate the expression of JARID2 through miR-29a-3p induction.

The neuromediator, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) may be involved in the aberrant activation of the normal androgen receptor (AR) and increased AR variants. This study focused on plasma levels of progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) and examined the treatment outcomes with androgen receptor axis-targeted (ARAT) agents.  Methods:   One hundred patients with metastatic CRPC were enrolled. Enzalutamide (ENZ) or abiraterone acetate/prednisone (AA/P) were administered to 50 patients each in a nonrandomized manner as a first-line or later choice. Plasma ProGRP levels were determined using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay, and data were collected prospectively. The study endpoints were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and survival estimates.  Results:   In the ENZ series, ProGRP levels correlated with the maximum PSA change from baseline (high ProGRP: -34.5% vs. low ProGRP: -85.7% p = .033). PSA progression-free survival (PFS), radiographic/symptomatic (r/s) PFS, and overall survival (OS) in patients with high ProGRP were significantly worse than those in patients with low ProGRP (median PSA-PFS: 3.3 vs. 10.0 months, p = .001, r/s PFS: 5.0 vs. 15.0 months, p < 0.001, and OS 17.5 vs. 49.0 months, p < .001, respectively). In addition, ProGRP showed an independent predictive value for all survival estimates in multivariate analyses. In the AA/P series, ProGRP levels did not correlate with the PSA change or predict PSA-PFS and r/s PFS, but they maintained a significant difference in OS (19.0 vs. 48.0 months, p = .003).  Conclusions:   Plasma ProGRP provides a consistent predictive value for OS in metastatic CRPC patients who underwent therapy with ARAT agents. Meanwhile, ProGRP showed different predictive profiles for PSA- and r/s PFS between ENZ and AA/P.

Later discoveries associated Zika infection with sexual transmission and persistent replication in cells of the male reproductive tract. Prostate epithelial and carcinoma cells are favorable to virus replication, with studies pointing to transcriptomics alterations of immune and inflammation genes upon persistence. However, metabolome alterations promoted by the Zika virus in prostate cells are unknown. Given its chronic effects and oncolytic potential, we aim to investigate the metabolic alterations induced by the Zika virus in prostate epithelial (PNT1a) and adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells using an untargeted metabolomics approach and high-resolution mass spectrometry. PNT1a cells were viable up to 15 days post ZIKV infection, in contrast to its antiproliferative effect in the PC-3 cell lineage. Remarkable alterations in the PNT1a cell metabolism were observed upon infection, especially regarding glycerolipids, fatty acids, and acylcarnitines, which could be related to viral cellular resource exploitation, in addition to the over-time increase in oxidative stress metabolites associated with carcinogenesis. The upregulation of FA20:5 at 5 dpi in PC-3 cells corroborates the antiproliferative effect observed since this metabolite was previously reported to induce PC-3 cell death. Overall, Zika virus promotes extensive lipid alterations on both PNT1a and PC-3 cells, promoting different outcomes based on the cellular metabolic state.""","""['Jeany Delafiori', 'Alessandra V de S Faria', 'Arthur N de Oliveira', 'Geovana M Sales', 'Flávia Luísa Dias-Audibert', 'Rodrigo R Catharino']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Proteome Res""","""['Molecular signatures associated with prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) exposure to inactivated Zika virus.', 'Zika Virus Associated Pathology and Antigen Presence in the Testicle in the Absence of Sexual Transmission During Subacute to Chronic Infection in a Mouse Model.', 'Zika Virus Infection, Reproductive Organ Targeting, and Semen Transmission in the Male Olive Baboon.', 'An update on the aspects of Zika virus infection on male reproductive system.', 'Apoptosis during ZIKA Virus Infection: Too Soon or Too Late?']"""

Specifically, to generate these core-shell pSiNPs, the interior surface of a porous silicon (pSi) film was hydrosilylated with 1-dodecene, followed by ultrasonication to create pSiNPs. The new external surfaces were modified by silanization with a polymerization initiator, and surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization was performed to introduce polyHPAm brushes. Afterward, a fraction of the polymer side chain hydroxyl groups was activated to conjugate cRGDfK─a peptide with a high affinity and selectivity for the ανβ3 integrin receptor that is overexpressed in prostate and melanoma cancers. Finally, camptothecin, a hydrophobic anti-cancer drug, was successfully loaded into the pores. This drug delivery system showed excellent colloidal stability in a cell culture medium, and the in vitro drug release kinetics could be fine-tuned by the combination of internal and external surface modifications. In vitro studies by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry revealed improved cellular association attributed to cRGDfK.

Methods:   The MoReFUn method resolves spatial aliasing using constraints introduced by a pharmacokinetic model that describes the signal evolution of both pyruvate and lactate. Acceleration was evaluated on three single-channel data sets: a numerical digital phantom that is used to validate the accuracy of reconstruction and model parameter restoration under various SNR and undersampling ratios, prospectively and retrospectively sampled data of an in vitro dynamic multispectral phantom, and retrospectively undersampled imaging data from a prostate cancer patient to test the fidelity of reconstructed metabolite time series.  Results:   All three data sets showed successful reconstruction using MoReFUn. In simulation and retrospective phantom data, the restored time series of pyruvate and lactate maintained the image details, and the mean square residual error of the accelerated reconstruction increased only slightly (< 10%) at a reduction factor up to 8. In prostate data, the quantitative estimation of the conversion-rate constant of pyruvate to lactate was achieved with high accuracy of less than 10% error at a reduction factor of 2 compared with the conversion rate derived from unaccelerated data.

Highly co-expressed genes with PNN (HCEG) were constructed for pathway enrichment analysis and drug prediction. A prognostic signature based on methylation status using HCEG was constructed. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and the TISIDB database were utilised to analyse the associations between PNN and tumour-infiltrating immune cells. The upregulated PNN expression in PCa at both transcription and protein levels suggests its potential as an independent prognostic factor of PCa. Analyses of the PNN's co-expression network indicated that PNN plays a role in RNA splicing and spliceosomes.

Two versions of human references are currently used in the biomedical literature, GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38. Conversions between these versions are critical for quality control, imputation, and association analysis. In the present study, we show that single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in regions inverted between different builds of the reference genome are often mishandled bioinformatically. Depending on the array type, SNVs are found in approximately 2-5 Mb of the genome that are inverted between reference builds. Coordinate conversions of these variants are mishandled by both the TOPMed imputation server as well as routine in-house quality control pipelines, leading to underrecognized downstream analytical consequences. Specifically, we observe that undetected allelic conversion errors for palindromic (i.e., A/T or C/G) variants in these inverted regions would destabilize the local haplotype structure, leading to loss of imputation accuracy and power in association analyses. Though only a small proportion of the genome is affected, these regions include important disease susceptibility variants that would be affected. For example, the p value of a known locus associated with prostate cancer on chromosome 10 (chr10) would drop from 2.86 × 10-7 to 0.0011 in a case-control analysis of 20,286 Africans and African Americans (10,643 cases and 9,643 controls).

For the purpose of multi-domain learning/prediction and investigation on the generalization capability of deep neural network, an expectation-maximization (EM)-based domain adaptation approach is proposed to improve the segmentation performance, in particular for the head and neck cancer slides. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the segmentation performances. The average Dice coefficient for prostate cancer slides is 0.82 and 0.79 for head and neck cancer slides.

In aged and well-fit patients, an indication for taxane chemotherapy should remain similar to the general population. Aiming to explore predictive factors of fitness to taxane chemotherapy in older adult patients, a prospective observational study was carried out in our institution.  Materials and methods:   We collected data from a prospective mono-centric database of patients aged ≥70 years old that were treated in our department. All patients underwent taxane treatment (either docetaxel or cabazitaxel, the latter only in second line setting) starting with standard treatment schedules (75 mg/m2 or 25 mg/m2 every three weeks, respectively). Data about G8 score post treatment decreases were collected and reported. We explored associations between baseline age, G8 score, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) with taxane dose reduction (DR), treatment temporary suspension (TS), or definitive interruption (TDI). Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore potential predictive factors for tolerability in patients treated with docetaxel.  Results:   One hundred-eighteen patients underwent taxane chemotherapy between 2011 and 2022, the majority of cases in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) setting (85.6%). In the overall population, DR was performed in 40.7% of cases, and TS and TDI were deemed necessary in 28% and 22.9% of patients, respectively. Forty-seven percent of patients reported a significant deterioration in terms of G8 score (from > to ≤14). Sixty-two percent of the overall population were deemed fit for further treatment after taxane chemotherapy. Rate of DR, TS, and TDI was 29.4%, 11.8% and 9.2% in the docetaxel subgroup, vs 48%, 60% and 12% of patients treated with cabazitaxel, respectively. Lower baseline G8 was reported as a continuous variable and the only independent predictive factor for TDI in docetaxel subgroup (odds ratio [OR] 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-0.68, p = 0.0008).  Discussion:   Our data suggest that tolerability of taxane regimens in a pre-treated population of older patients with prostate cancer is acceptable, despite a non-negligible rate of TDI.

In this pilot study, we characterize the mp-MRI features using the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) for recurrent prostate cancer (PCa) following proton radiation therapy.  Methods:   After obtaining IRB approval, we identified 163 consecutive cases who underwent MRI-fusion prostate biopsy at our institution from November 2017 to May 2020. This study evaluated patients with prostate cancer (PCa) with biochemical recurrence following proton radiation. Patients were excluded if they had grossly metastatic disease, metal fragments, implanted devices, or with surgically removed prostates. The mpMRI studies were reviewed in depth and scored by 2 fellowship-trained radiologists. Following MRI-fusion biopsy of lesions of interest (LOI), slides were read by fellowship-trained pathologists.  Results:   We found 14 patients with 16 lesions who met the study inclusion criteria. The median age was 69 years (range 57-79) and median time to biochemical recurrence was 7.3 years (range 3-13). On post-treatment imaging, decreases in prostate size and diffusely decreased T2 signal intensity were observed, making the use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and early enhancement at dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging often necessary for diagnosis of disease recurrence. We identified a total of 16 lesions with PIRADS scores of 3 or higher. Of these lesions, there were 5 PIRADS 3 lesions (4/5 (80%) without prostate cancer), 7 PIRADS 4-5 lesions (6 (86%) had high risk Pca), and 4 lesions with unassigned PIRADS scores (100% had high risk cancers). Among the MRI variables, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) heterogeneity had the strongest association with recurrence of PCa (P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Results of our pilot study showed that the PIRADS scoring system in the postproton radiation therapy setting has some correlations with prostate cancer recurrence; However, the clinical value of these findings are unclear. While definitive PIRADS categorization of lesions demonstrated expected frequency of cancer consistent with the scoring system, all unassigned lesions also harbored malignancy suggesting a cautious approach to PIRADS scoring system in postproton radiation setting. The findings from this study may be validated using a larger cohort.""","""['Soroush Bazargani', 'Allison H Feibus', 'Ahmed Elshafei', 'Mohammed Al-Toubat', 'Dheeraj Reddy Gopireddy', 'Shiva Gautam', 'Shivon Barwari', 'Randal Henderson', 'Chandana Lall', 'K C Balaji', 'Mark Bandyk']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Susceptibility artifacts and PIRADS 3 lesions in prostatic MRI: how often is the dynamic contrast-enhance sequence necessary?', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion-assisted biopsy for the diagnosis of local recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Histology core-specific evaluation of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) standardised scoring system of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate.', 'S-PI-RADS and PI-RRADS for Biparametric MRI in the Detection of Prostate Cancer and Post-treatment Local Recurrence.']"""

Results:   Over a median of 22.1 years' follow-up, there were 7752 overall, 858 breast and 1376 prostate cancer cases. Medium and high levels of eCRF were associated with a reduced incidence of overall cancer in a dose-response manner in all participants (HR 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.01 and HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.91, respectively, and P-value for trend <.001). No association was observed between eCRF and breast cancer incidence in women. Only the high level of eCRF seemed to be associated with a reduced incidence of prostate cancer in men (HR 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72-1.02).  Conclusions:   eCRF may be a practical and cost-effective means of investigating the association between the CRF and cancer incidence.""","""['Jin Wang', 'Xiao-Mei Mai', 'Yi-Qian Sun']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Ann Epidemiol""","""['Cross-sectional and longitudinal association of non-exercise estimated cardiorespiratory fitness with depression and anxiety in the general population: The HUNT study.', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness and future risk of venous thromboembolism.', 'Estimated Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Risk of Atrial Fibrillation: The Nord-Trøndelag Health Study.', 'Cardiorespiratory fitness is not associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer: A cohort study and review of the literature.', 'Are lower levels of cardiorespiratory fitness associated with incident depression?

Treatment that targets epigenetic regulators is becoming an attractive strategy for cancer therapy. The role of epigenetic therapy in prostate cancer (PCa) remains elusive. Previously we demonstrated that upregulation of histone lysine demethylase KDM4B correlated with the appearance of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and identified a small molecular inhibitor of KDM4B, B3. In this study, we further investigated the role of KDM4B in promoting PCa progression and tested the efficacy of B3 using clinically relevant PCa models including PCa cell line LNCaP and 22Rv1 and xenografts derived from these cell lines. In loss and gain-functional studies of KDM4B in PCa cells, we found that overexpression of KDM4B in LNCaP cells enhanced its tumorigenicity whereas knockdown of KDM4B in 22Rv1 cells reduced tumor growth in castrated mice. B3 suppressed the growth of 22Rv1 xenografts and sensitized tumor to anti-androgen receptor (AR) antagonist enzalutamide inhibition. B3 also inhibited 22Rv1 tumor growth synergistically with rapamycin, leading to cell apoptosis. Comparative transcriptomic analysis performed on KDM4B knockdown and B3-treated 22Rv1 cells revealed that B3 inhibited both H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 demethylase activities. Our studies establish KDM4B as a target for CRPC and B3 as a potential therapeutic agent. B3 as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-PCa therapeutics offers proof of principle for the clinical translation of epigenetic therapy targeting KDMs for CRPC patients.""","""['Lingling Duan', 'Yu-An Chen', 'Yanping Liang', 'Zhenhua Chen', 'Jun Lu', 'Yong Fang', 'Jiazheng Cao', 'Jian Lu', 'Hongwei Zhao', 'Rey-Chen Pong', 'Elizabeth Hernandez', 'Payal Kapur', 'Tram Anh T Tran', 'Tristan Smith', 'Elisabeth D Martinez', 'Jung-Mo Ahn', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Jun-Hang Luo', 'Zhi-Ping Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the KDM4B-AR-c-Myc axis promotes sensitivity to androgen receptor-targeted therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Upregulated KDM4B promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by activating autophagy.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The emerging role of histone lysine demethylases in prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   We completed a retrospective comparative analysis of 1703 sequential patients that had a Pbx in 2010 to 2012 (3 years) with 1006 patients biopsied in 2018, 2019 and 2021 (3 years). Data from a total of 2709 Pbx was collected on patient age, race, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), digital rectal examination (DRE) and Gleason sum score (GSS). The data was analyzed to determine whether the 2012 USPSTF screening recommendations against prostate cancer screening may have affected prostate cancer characteristics. Two study groups were defined as Group A and Group B. Group A represents Pbx prior to the 2012 USPSTF screening guidelines (2010-2012) and Group B represents Pbx in 2018-19 and 2021. The patient population consisted of 76% Black, 14% White and 11% other.  Results:   The number of patients that had a Pbx in Groups A vs. B: 567 patients/year vs. 335 patients/year. The annual positive Pbx rate for Group A vs. B: 134/year vs. 175/year. High grade prostate cancer (GSS 7-10) in Groups A vs. B: 51.5% vs. 59%. The proportion of patients with a PSA 10 ng/mL or greater in Groups A vs. B: 25.4% vs. 31%. The PSA 10 ng/mL and over and GSS 7-10 was higher in Group B for all age groups. In 2021, GSS 7-10 was present in 64% of 70-80 year olds. In Group B, GSS 6 decreased by 7.5% while GSS 7-10 increased by 7.5% compared with Group A.  Conclusions:   Our data through the year 2021 shows that after the 2012 USPSTF recommendations against prostate cancer screening, Pbx decreased and prostate cancer diagnosis and high grade (GSS 7-10) prostate cancer increased. As our patient population consists of 76% Black patients and 33% of men age 70-80 years old, our results support annual prostate cancer screening for US men 50-80 years old and especially high-risk patients that include Black men, men with a family history of prostate cancer and healthy men age 70-80 years old.

Patients and methods:   Men with focal recurrent PCa after external beam radiation or brachytherapy without metastatic disease on staging imaging and co-registration between mpMRI and biopsies were prospectively included in this multicenter trial. Adverse events were reported following the Clavien-Dindo classification. Validated questionnaires were used for patient-reported functional outcomes. Follow-up consisted of 3 monthly prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, a 6-month mpMRI and standardised transperineal template mapping biopsies at 12-months. Thereafter follow-up was guided by MRI and/or PSMA-PET/CT and PSA. Local recurrence was defined as any ISUP score ≥2 on biopsies.  Results:   37 patients were analysed with a median (interquartile range (IQR)) follow up of 29 (22-43) months.

We hypothesize that a focal approach to brachytherapy boosts targeting only grossly visualized tumor volumes (GTV) combined with stereotactic radiotherapy will improve quality of life (QoL) outcomes without compromising cancer control.  Methods:   150 patients with intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer will be enrolled and randomized 1:1 in a cohort multiple randomized clinical trial phase 2 design. Patients are eligible if planned for standard-of-care (SOC) high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost to radiotherapy (RT) with GTVs encompassing < 50% of the prostate gland. Those randomly selected will be offered the experimental treatment, consisting of focal HDR brachytherapy boost (fBT) of 13-15 Gy in 1 fraction followed by stereotactic radiotherapy (sRT) 36.25-40 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate (+/- 25 Gy to the elective pelvis) delivered every other day. The primary endpoint is to determine if fBTsRT is superior to SOC by having fewer patients experience a minimally important decline (MID) in urinary function as measured by EPIC-26 at 1 and 2 years. Secondary endpoints include rates of toxicity measured by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), and failure-free survival outcomes.  Discussion:   This study will determine whether a novel approach for the treatment of localized prostate cancer, fBTsRT, improves QoL and merits further evaluation.

The objective of this study was to construct an African ancestry-specific PrCa PRS (PRState) and evaluate its performance.  Methods:   African ancestry group of 4,533 individuals in ELLIPSE consortium was used for discovery of African ancestry-specific PrCa SNPs. PRState was constructed as weighted sum of genotypes and effect sizes from genome-wide association study (GWAS) of PrCa in African ancestry group. Performance was evaluated using ROC-AUC analysis.  Results:   We identified African ancestry-specific PrCa risk loci on chromosomes 3, 8, and 11 and constructed a polygenic risk score (PRS) from 10 African ancestry-specific PrCa risk SNPs, achieving an AUC of 0.61 [0.60-0.63] and 0.65 [0.64-0.67], when combined with age and family history. Performance dropped significantly when using ancestry-mismatched PRS models but remained comparable when using trans-ancestry models. Importantly, we validated the PRState score in the Million Veteran Program (MVP), demonstrating improved prediction of PrCa and metastatic PrCa in individuals of African ancestry.

RT-induced rectal toxicities remain a clinical challenge, limiting the prescribed dose during prostate RT. To address the spatial proximity challenge by physically increasing the distance between the posterior aspect of the prostate and the ARW, several physical devices such as endorectal balloons (ERBs), rectal hydrogel spacers, and rectal retractor (RR) have been developed.

RILA values were measured by flow cytometry. We found that CT genotype of TGFB1 C-509T could be protective biomarker for acute genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) radiotoxicity, while Thr variant of XRCC3 Thr241Met could predict the risk for acute GU radiotoxicity. Correlation between RILA values and toxicity was not detected. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that Gleason score and risk group were risk factors for late GU, while for late GI radiotoxicity it was diabetes mellitus type 2.

We herein compared radical prostatectomy (RP) findings and long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with prostate cancer with PNI in two prostate biopsy (PBx) sites.  Methods:   We retrospectively assessed 170 consecutive patients undergoing systematic sextant PBx where PNI had been detected in two of six PBx sites, followed by RP.  Results:   PNI occurred unilaterally in 140 (82.4%) cases and bilaterally in 30 (17.6%) cases. Compared with unilateral PNI, bilateral PNI was significantly associated with a higher number of cancer-positive sites and longer total tumor length on PBx. However, there were no significant differences in RP findings, including tumor grade/stage and tumor volume, between unilateral and bilateral PNI cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with bilateral PNI had a significantly higher risk of disease progression after RP than those with unilateral PNI (P = .038). In multivariate analysis, bilateral PNI (vs unilateral PNI) showed significance for progression (hazard ratio, 2.281; P = .023).

Their expression and functional changes have been observed in most cancers. Meanwhile, there exists cooperative regulation among miRNAs which is important for studying the mechanisms of complex post-transcriptional regulations. Hence, studying miRNA synergy and identifying miRNA synergistic modules can help understand the development and progression of complex diseases, such as cancers. This work studies miRNA synergy and proposes a new method for defining disease-related modules (DDRM) by combining the knowledge databases and miRNA data. DDRM measures the miRNA synergy not only by the co-regulating target subset but also by the non-common target set to construct the weighted miRNA synergistic network (WMSN). The experiments on twelve the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) datasets showed that the important modules identified by DDRM can well distinguish the cancer samples from the normal samples, and DDRM performed better than the previous method in most cases. An external dataset of prostate cancer was applied to validate the module biomarkers determined by DDRM on the prostate cancer data of TCGA. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value is 0.92 and the performance is superior. Hence, combining the miRNA synergy networks from the knowledge databases and the miRNA data can determine the important functional modules related to diseases, which is of great significance to the study of disease mechanism.""","""['Chao Li', 'Peng Dou', 'Tianxiang Wang', 'Xin Lu', 'Guowang Xu', 'Xiaohui Lin']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['miRNA-mRNA correlation-network modules in human prostate cancer and the differences between primary and metastatic tumor subtypes.', 'Identification of candidate miRNA biomarkers from miRNA regulatory network with application to prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of aberrant miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in prostate cancer to conjecture its molecular mechanisms.', 'Identifying miRNA sponge modules using biclustering and regulatory scores.', 'RFCM3: Computational Method for Identification of miRNA-mRNA Regulatory Modules in Cervical Cancer.']"""

AR amplification made prostate cancer cells viable under treatment of AR-targeted therapy, leading to castration resistance. AR amplification was more common in enzalutamide-resistant patients. As a strategy to overcome castration resistance and to improve the efficacy of enzalutamide, second-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogen drugs for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) including topoisomerase II (topo II) poisons such as etoposide and mitoxantrone, have been administered in combination with enzalutamide. In the present study, it was confirmed that amplification of topo IIα, but not I and IIβ, was directly and proportionally associated with poor clinical outcome of Prostate cancer. Among a novel series of newly designed and synthesized 7-(3-aminopropyloxy)-substituted flavone analogues, compound 6, the most potent derivative, was further characterized and identified as a topo IIα catalytic inhibitor that intercalates into DNA and binds to the DNA minor groove with better efficacy and less genotoxicity than etoposide, a topo II poison.

No validated PCa risk model currently exists. We therefore sought to develop a genetic risk model that can provide personalized predicted PCa risks on the basis of known moderate- to high-risk pathogenic variants, low-risk common genetic variants, and explicit cancer family history, and to externally validate the model in an independent prospective cohort.  Materials and methods:   We developed a risk model using a kin-cohort comprising individuals from 16,633 PCa families ascertained in the United Kingdom from 1993 to 2017 from the UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study, and complex segregation analysis adjusting for ascertainment. The model was externally validated in 170,850 unaffected men (7,624 incident PCas) recruited from 2006 to 2010 to the independent UK Biobank prospective cohort study.  Results:   The most parsimonious model included the effects of pathogenic variants in BRCA2, HOXB13, and BRCA1, and a polygenic score on the basis of 268 common low-risk variants. Residual familial risk was modeled by a hypothetical recessively inherited variant and a polygenic component whose standard deviation decreased log-linearly with age. The model predicted familial risks that were consistent with those reported in previous observational studies. In the validation cohort, the model discriminated well between unaffected men and men with incident PCas within 5 years (C-index, 0.790; 95% CI, 0.783 to 0.797) and 10 years (C-index, 0.772; 95% CI, 0.768 to 0.777). The 50% of men with highest predicted risks captured 86.3% of PCa cases within 10 years.  Conclusion:   To our knowledge, this is the first validated risk model offering personalized PCa risks.

Spatial regression models and the Geodetector method were used to explore the potential associations of anthropogenic and natural factors with prostate cancer.  Results:   The incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in China from 2012 to 2016 rapidly increased.

Bone metastasis is one of the main problems arising from prostate cancer. Spondin 2 is a diagnostic marker specific for prostate cancer; however, the role of spondin 2 in prostate cancer‑driven osteogenesis remains unclear. The present study was carried out to explore the role of spondin 2 on prostate cancer cell‑induced osteogenesis. In the present study, the expression of spondin 2 was analyzed in prostate cancer samples obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. The supernatant of prostate cancer cells was used to treat the osteoblast precursor MC3T3‑E1 cell line to determine the effect of spondin 2 on osteoblasts. The effect of spondin 2 on osteogenic factor production was also examined after neutralization with a spondin 2 antibody in vitro via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. Furthermore, the effect of spondin 2 on the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was assessed using a patient dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas and in vitro via western blot analysis. In addition, an inhibitor of spondin 2 receptor (ATN‑161) was used to explore the inhibition effect of spondin 2 receptor in MC3T3‑E1 cells.

However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been fully clarified. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) on the malignant behaviors of PCa cells and to explore the possible molecular mechanisms involved. The expression levels of PVT1 and microRNA (miRNA/miR)‑27b‑3p in PCa tissues and cell lines were measured using reverse‑transcritpion‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Methyltransferase 3 (METTL3)‑mediated PVT1 N6‑methyladenosine (m6A) modifications were detected using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull‑down assays. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the interactions of miR‑27b‑3p with PVT1 and bloom syndrome protein (BLM), and these interactions were validated using RIP, dual‑luciferase reporter and biotin pull‑down assays. The functional importance of miR‑27b‑3p, PVT1 and BLM within PCa cells was assessed through the in vitro utilization of Cell Counting Kit‑8, Transwell, wound healing and colony formation assays, and the in vivo use of a mouse xenograft model. The results revealed the high expression level of PVT1 in PCa tissues and cells, and epigenetic analyses revealed the upregulation of PVT1 expression following METTL3‑mediated m6A modification. PVT1 overexpression induced PCa cells to become more proliferative, migratory and invasive, whereas PVT1 knockdown led to the opposite phenotype. Furthermore, miR‑27b‑3p was found to target both PVT1 and BLM, and PVT1 functioned to sequester miR‑27b‑3p within cells, thereby indirectly promoting the BLM expression level. BLM overexpression reversed the adverse effects of PVT1 knockdown on the migratory, proliferative and invasive capabilities of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. The overexpression of PVT1 contributed to the aggressive phenotype of PCa cells by regulating the miR‑27b‑3p/BLM axis. On the whole, the findings of the present study may provide novel potential targets for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Bin Chen', 'Chang Liu', 'Hong Long', 'Guohui Bai', 'Yuhang Zhu', 'Houqiang Xu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Long non-coding RNA PVT1 promotes tumor progression by regulating the miR-143/HK2 axis in gallbladder cancer.', ""miR‑27b‑3p and miR‑607 cooperatively regulate BLM gene expression by directly targeting the 3'‑UTR in PC3 cells."", 'Long Noncoding RNA PVT1 Promotes Prostate Cancer Metastasis by Increasing NOP2 Expression via Targeting Tumor Suppressor MicroRNAs.', 'The long non-coding RNA PVT1/miR-145-5p/ITGB8 axis regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion in non-small cell lung cancer cells.', 'Long Noncoding RNA Plasmacytoma Variant Translocation 1 Regulates Cisplatin Resistance via miR-3619-5p/TBL1XR1 Axis in Gastric Cancer.', 'The emerging roles and mechanism of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in urologic tumours progression.']"""

AS has been reported to have anticancer effects on numerous cancer types, such as ovarian carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer. Our previous studies demonstrated that antrocins and triterpenoids are possibly bioactive compositions. However, the effects of AS on prostate cancer remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of AS in prostate cancer growth, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. The results showed that AS extracts significantly inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner and increased the levels of apoptotic markers (cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3/8/9). In addition, the cell cycle-related proteins CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and their respective specific regulators Cyclin B1, Cyclin A, and Cyclin D were also affected. Besides, AS treatment increased p53 protein levels and slowed its degradation in LNCaP cells. Interestingly, we found that AS treatment reduced both total protein and Ser-81 phosphorylation levels of the androgen receptor (AR). Notably, the increase of nuclear p53 was accompanied by the down-regulation of AR, suggesting a reverse regulation between p53 and AR in LNCaP cells was triggered by AS treatment. These findings suggest that AS extracts trigger the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells through the reverse regulation of p53 and AR and elucidate that AS extracts might be a potential treatment for androgen-dependent prostate cancer in the near future.""","""['Chieh-Yin Chen', 'Yu-Hsuan Li', 'Wan-Ling Liao', 'Muhammet Oner', 'Yu-Chiao Cheng', 'Fang-Ling Liu', 'Pang-Ting Cheng', 'Ayse Celik', 'Jyh-Horng Wu', 'Chih-Ho Lai', 'Jer-Tsong Hsieh', 'Ho Lin', 'Ting-Chieh Chang', 'Chih-Ying Chang', 'Mei-Chih Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Evid Based Complement Alternat Med""","""['Antrodia salmonea extract inhibits cell proliferation through regulating cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Activation of p53 signaling and inhibition of androgen receptor mediate tanshinone IIA induced G1 arrest in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Antrodia salmonea-induced oxidative stress abrogates HER-2 signaling cascade and enhanced apoptosis in ovarian carcinoma cells.', 'Piperazine-designed alpha 1A/alpha 1D-adrenoceptor blocker KMUP-1 and doxazosin provide down-regulation of androgen receptor and PSA in prostatic LNCaP cells growth and specifically in xenografts.']"""

Recent trials have shown potential in using machine learning to develop automated systems to address this challenge. Most automated deep learning systems for prostate cancer Gleason grading focused on supervised learning requiring demanding fine-grained pixel-level annotations.  Methods:   A weakly-supervised deep learning model with slide-level labels is presented in this study for the diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer with whole slide image (WSI). WSIs are first cropped into small patches and then processed with a deep learning model to extract patch-level features. A graph convolution network (GCN) is used to aggregate the features for classifications. Throughout the training process, the noisy labels are progressively filtered out to reduce inter-observer variations in clinical reports. Finally, multi-center independent test cohorts with 6,174 slides are collected to evaluate the prostate cancer diagnosis and grading performance of our model.  Results:   The cancer diagnosis (2-level classification) results on two external test sets (n= 4,675, n= 844) show an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.985 and 0.986. The Gleason grading (6-level classification) results reach 0.931 quadratic weighted kappa on the internal test set (n= 531). It generalizes well on the external test dataset (n= 844) with 0.801 quadratic weighted kappa with the reference standard set independently. The model enables pathological meaningful interpretability by visualizing the most attended lesions which are highly consistent with expert annotations.  Conclusion:   The proposed model incorporates a graph network in weakly supervised learning with only slide-level reports. A robust learning strategy is also employed to correct the label noise. It is highly accurate (>0.985 AUC for diagnosis) and also interpretable with intuitive heatmap visualization.

We previously reported that long arginine-rich dipeptide repeats (DPRs), mimicking abnormal proteins expressed from the hexanucleotide expansion, caused translation stalling when expressed in cell culture models. Whether this stalling provides a mechanism of pathogenicity remains to be determined. Here, we explored the molecular features of DPR-induced stalling and examined whether known mechanisms such as ribosome quality control (RQC) regulate translation elongation on sequences that encode arginine-rich DPRs. We demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs lead to stalling in a length-dependent manner, with lengths longer than 40 repeats invoking severe translation arrest. Mutational screening of 40×Gly-Xxx DPRs shows that stalling is most pronounced when Xxx is a charged amino acid (Arg, Lys, Glu, or Asp). Through a genome-wide knockout screen, we find that genes regulating stalling on polyadenosine mRNA coding for poly-Lys, a canonical RQC substrate, act differently in the case of arginine-rich DPRs. Indeed, these findings point to a limited scope for natural regulatory responses to resolve the arginine-rich DPR stalls, even though the stalls may be sensed, as evidenced by an upregulation of RQC gene expression. These findings therefore implicate arginine-rich DPR-mediated stalled ribosomes as a source of stress and toxicity and may be a crucial component in pathomechanisms.""","""['Viacheslav Kriachkov', 'Angelique R Ormsby', 'Eric P Kusnadi', 'Hamish E G McWilliam', 'Justine D Mintern', 'Shanika L Amarasinghe', 'Matthew E Ritchie', 'Luc Furic', 'Danny M Hatters']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Reactivation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay protects against C9orf72 dipeptide-repeat neurotoxicity.', 'C9orf72 Dipeptide Repeats Cause Selective Neurodegeneration and Cell-Autonomous Excitotoxicity in Drosophila Glutamatergic Neurons.', 'Arginine-rich dipeptide-repeat proteins as phase disruptors in C9-ALS/FTD.', 'Sense-encoded poly-GR dipeptide repeat proteins correlate to neurodegeneration and uniquely co-localize with TDP-43 in dendrites of repeat-expanded C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.', 'C9orf72 ALS-FTD: recent evidence for dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway at multiple levels.']"""

Patients with positive family history for prostate cancer showed high levels of EGFR, TG, TC, LDL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), but low AKR1C4, SLDLRP1, CAV1 and ABCA-1 levels. Smokers had high CAV1 level (P = 0.017). After 6 months of castration and rosuvastatin administration, PSA, TG, LDL and TC were significantly reduced, while AKR1C4, HMGCR, SLDLRP1, CAV1 and ABCA-1 were significantly increased. Overall survival was reduced in patients with high baseline of SLDLRP1 (>3385 pg/ml, P = 0.001), PSA (>40 ng/ml, P = 0.003) and CAV1 (>4955 pg/ml, P = 0.021).  Conclusion:   Results of the current study suggest that the peripheral lipidogenic effects of rosuvastatin may have an impact on the treatment outcome and survival of castrated mPC patients.

Herein, a solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) biosensor for the ultrasensitive and rapid quantification detection of the early prostate cancer-relevant biomarker, miRNA-21 is reported. The designed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probes immobilized on the Au gate can hybridize effectively with the miRNA-21 molecules targets and induce the Dirac voltage shifts of SGGT transfer curves. The limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor can reach 10-20 M without amplification and any chemical or biological labeling. The detection linear range is from 10-20 to 10-12 M. The sensor can realize real-time detection of the miRNA-21 molecules in less than 5 min and can well distinguish one-mismatched miRNA-21 molecule. The blood serum samples from the patients without RNA extraction and amplification are measured. The results demonstrated that the biosensor can well distinguish the cancer patients from the control group and has higher sensitivity (100%) than PSA detection (58.3%).

Despite the efficacy of such approaches, a small population of ""persisters"" develop evasion strategies to therapy-induced cell death. While previous studies have identified mechanisms of resistance to apoptosis, the mechanisms by which persisters dampen other forms of cell death, such as pyroptosis, remain to be elucidated. Pyroptosis is a form of inflammatory cell death that involves formation of membrane pores, ion gradient imbalance, water inflow, and membrane rupture. Herein, we investigate mechanisms by which cancer persisters resist pyroptosis, survive, then proliferate in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Lung, prostate, and esophageal cancer persister cells remaining after treatments exhibited several hallmarks indicative of pyroptosis resistance. The inflammatory attributes of persisters included chronic activation of inflammasome, STING, and type I interferons. Comprehensive metabolomic characterization uncovered that TKI-induced pyroptotic persisters display high methionine consumption and excessive taurine production. Elevated methionine flux or exogenous taurine preserved plasma membrane integrity via osmolyte-mediated effects. Increased dependency on methionine flux decreased the level of one carbon metabolism intermediate S-(5'-adenosyl)-L-homocysteine, a determinant of cell methylation capacity. The consequent increase in methylation potential induced DNA hypermethylation of genes regulating metal ion balance and intrinsic immune response. This enabled thwarting TKI resistance by using the hypomethylating agent decitabine. In summary, the evolution of resistance to pyroptosis can occur via a stepwise process of physical acclimation and epigenetic changes without existing or recurrent mutations.  Significance:   Methionine enables cancer cells to persist by evading pyroptotic osmotic lysis, which leads to genome-wide hypermethylation that allows persisters to gain proliferative advantages.""","""['Asmaa El-Kenawi', 'Anders Berglund', 'Veronica Estrella', 'Yonghong Zhang', 'Min Liu', 'Ryan M Putney', 'Sean J Yoder', 'Joseph Johnson', 'Joel Brown', 'Robert Gatenby']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Caspase-1 Inflammasome Activation Mediates Homocysteine-Induced Pyrop-Apoptosis in Endothelial Cells.', 'Single-cell analysis of pyroptosis dynamics reveals conserved GSDMD-mediated subcellular events that precede plasma membrane rupture.', 'Pyroptosis-based nanotherapeutics: Possible mechanisms for cancer treatment.', 'Induction of pyroptotic cell death as a potential tool for cancer treatment.', 'Inflammasome priming increases retinal pigment epithelial cell susceptibility to lipofuscin phototoxicity by changing the cell death mechanism from apoptosis to pyroptosis.', 'Targeted deprivation of methionine with engineered Salmonella leads to oncolysis and suppression of metastasis in broad types of animal tumor models.']"""

To explore the potential of using pre-DRE urine specimens for detecting AG-PCa, we compared glycoproteins between pre- and post-DRE urine specimens, verified the previously identified post-DRE AG-PCa-associated urinary glycoproteins in pre-DRE urine specimens, and explored potential new glycoproteins for AG-PCa detection in pre-DRE urine specimens. Quantitative glycoproteomic data were acquired for 154 pre-DRE urine specimens from 41 patients with no cancer at biopsy, 48 patients with non-AG-PCa (Gleason score = 6), and 65 patients with AG-PCa (Gleason score 7 or above). Compared to glycopeptides from the post-DRE urine data, humoral immunity-related proteins were enriched in pre-DRE urine samples, whereas cell mediated immune response proteins were enriched in post-DRE urine samples. Analyses of AG-PCa-associated glycoproteins from pre-DRE urine revealed that the three urinary glycoproteins, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (ACPP), and CD97 antigen (CD97) that were previously identified in post-DRE urine samples, were also observed as AG-PCa associated glycoproteins in pre-DRE urine. In addition, we identified three new glycoproteins, fibrillin 1 (FBN1), vitronectin (VTN), and hemicentin 2 (HMCN2), to be potentially associated with AG-PCa in pre-DRE urine specimens.

Prostate cancer cells that pass through a transwell membrane (mig cells) have a higher migration potential with a decreased AR expression than parental cells. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of migration enhancement associated with the suppression of AR signaling. Expression of C-C motif ligand 20 (CCL20) is upregulated in mig cells, unlike in the parental cells. Knockdown of AR with small interfering RNA (siAR) in LNCaP and C4-2B cells increased CCL20 secretion and enhanced the migration of cancer cells. Mig cells, CCL20-treated cells, and siAR cells promoted cell migration with an enhancement of AKT phosphorylation and Snail expression, while the addition of a C-C chemokine receptor 6 (CCR6, the specific receptor of CCL20) inhibitor, anti-CCL20 antibody, and AKT inhibitor suppressed the activation of AKT and Snail. With 59 samples of prostate cancer tissue, CCL20 secretion was profuse in metastatic cases despite low AR expression levels. Snail expression was associated with the expression of CCL20 and CCR6.

However, the mechanisms whereby aberrant AR-V expression is increased in PCa are still largely unknown. Fibroblasts in tumor stroma influence PCa initiation and aggressiveness, and which may play a crucial role in eliciting genetic changes during malignant transformation in human prostate epithelium. Here, our aim was to determine whether prostate fibroblasts in tumor stroma induce aberrant AR-V7 expression in PCa cells under low androgen concentration.  Methods:   We performed in vitro experiments using androgen-sensitive, AR-positive PCa cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells), commercially available prostate stromal cells (PrSC), and primary cultured prostate fibroblasts (pcPrF) from PCa specimens collected from biopsies of patients with advanced PCa. PCa cells were cocultured with each of the three fibroblast lines (PrSC, pcPrF-M37, and pcPrF-M48).  Results:   The proliferation under low androgen concentration of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells cocultured with PrSC, pcPrF-M37, or pcPrF-M48 was significantly increased compared to that of PCa cells cultured alone. Androgen receptor-full length (AR-FL) protein expression was increased in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells cocultured with PrSC, pcPrF-M37, or pcPrF-M48. AR-V7 protein expression was increased in 22Rv1 cells cocultured with PrSC, pcPrF-M37, or pcPrF-M48. Under low androgen concentration, AR-V7 protein expression was slightly detected in LNCaP cells cocultured with PrSC or pcPrF-M37. Cytokine array analysis revealed that monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels in the conditioned medium of 22Rv1 cells cocultured with PrSC, pcPrF-M37, or pcPrF-M48 were increased under low androgen concentration. High IL-8 concentration (30 ng/ml) resulted in significantly increased protein expression of AR-FL, AR-V7, and phospho-NF-κB p65 in 22Rv1 cells. In contrast, IL-8 antibody (1 µg/ml) decreased AR-V7 protein expression in 22Rv1 cells cocultured with PrSC, pcPrF-M37, or pcPrF-M48.

Insufficient stratification according to the aggressiveness at the time of diagnosis causes unnecessary or delayed treatment. Current stratification systems are not effective enough because they are based on clinical, surgical or biochemical parameters, but do not take into account molecular factors driving PCa cancerogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important players in molecular pathogenesis of PCa and could serve as valuable biomarkers for the assessment of disease aggressiveness and its prognosis.  Methods:   In the study, in total, 280 PCa patients were enrolled. The miRNA expression profiles were analyzed in FFPE PCa tissue using the miRCURY LNA miRNA PCR System. The expression levels of candidate miRNAs were further verified by two-level validation using the RT-qPCR method and evaluated in relation to PCa stratification reflecting the disease aggressiveness.  Results:   MiRNA profiling revealed 172 miRNAs dysregulated between aggressive (ISUP 3-5) and indolent PCa (ISUP 1) (p < 0.05). In the training and validation cohort, miR-15b-5p and miR-106b-5p were confirmed to be significantly upregulated in tissue of aggressive PCa when their level was associated with disease aggressiveness. Furthermore, we established a prognostic score combining the level of miR-15b-5p and miR-106b-5p with serum PSA level, which discriminated indolent PCa from an aggressive form with even higher analytical parameters (AUC being 0.9338 in the training set and 0.8014 in the validation set, respectively). The score was also associated with 5-year biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS) of PCa patients.

The rotatable shields provide an additional degree of freedom, but also introduce an additional, directional, type of uncertainty, compared to conventional high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR BT).  Purpose:   We propose and evaluate a robust optimization approach to mitigate the effects of rotational uncertainty in the shields with respect to planning criteria.  Methods:   A previously suggested prototype for platinum-shielded prostate 169 Yb-based dynamic IMBT is considered. We study a retrospective patient data set (anatomical contours and catheter placement) from two clinics, consisting of six patients that had previously undergone conventional 192 Ir HDR BT treatment. The Monte Carlo-based treatment planning software RapidBrachyMCTPS is used for dose calculations. In our computational experiments, we investigate systematic rotational shield errors of ±10° and ±20°, and the same systematic error is applied to all dwell positions in each scenario. This gives us three scenarios, one nominal and two with errors. The robust optimization approach finds a compromise between the average and worst-case scenario outcomes.  Results:   We compare dose plans obtained from standard models and their robust counterparts. With dwell times obtained from a linear penalty model (LPM), for 10° errors, the dose to urethra ( D 0.1 c c $D_{0.1cc}$ ) and rectum ( D 0.1 c c $D_{0.1cc}$ and D 1 c c $D_{1cc}$ ) increase with up to 5% and 7%, respectively, in the worst-case scenario, while with the robust counterpart, the corresponding increases were 3% and 3%. For all patients and all evaluated criteria, the worst-case scenario outcome with the robust approach had lower deviation compared to the standard model, without compromising target coverage. We also evaluated shield errors up to 20° and while the deviations increased to a large extent with the standard models, the robust models were capable of handling even such large errors.  Conclusions:   We conclude that robust optimization can be used to mitigate the effects from rotational uncertainty and to ensure the treatment plan quality of IMBT.""","""['Björn Morén', 'Majd Antaki', 'Gabriel Famulari', 'Marc Morcos', 'Torbjörn Larsson', 'Shirin A Enger', 'Åsa Carlsson Tedgren']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['A novel 169 Yb-based dynamic-shield intensity modulated brachytherapy delivery system for prostate cancer.', 'Applying the column generation method to the intensity modulated high dose rate brachytherapy inverse planning problem.', 'Three dimensional intensity modulated brachytherapy (IMBT): dosimetry algorithm and inverse treatment planning.', 'Interstitial rotating shield brachytherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.']"""

Hypoxia induces therapy resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer. As a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, metformin has the potential to improve tumor oxygenation. In this study, we evaluate the anti-tumor effect of ascorbic acid combined with metformin in prostate cancer. We demonstrated that ascorbic acid inhibits prostate cancer cells proliferation by generating ROS, and metformin enhances the anti-tumor effects of ascorbic acid. Mechanistically, metformin reduces oxygen consumption rate and NADP+/NADPH value in prostate cancer cells, thereby increases the ROS content induced by ascorbic acid. In addition, our data demonstrated that ascorbic acid inhibits p-AKT signaling in a ROS-dependent pathway, leading to inhibition of p-mTOR expression. And metformin inhibits the p-mTOR expression by activating the AMPK signaling pathway, exerting a synergistic effect on tumor suppression with ascorbic acid. Furthermore, metformin improves tumor oxygenation, and the combined treatment effect of ascorbic acid and metformin were demonstrated in a xenograft model of prostate cancer. Taken together, our data demonstrate that metformin enhances the anti-tumor proliferation effect of ascorbic acid by increasing ROS content in castration-resistant prostate cancer. This provides a new strategy for the clinical application of high-dose ascorbic acid as an anti-tumor drug. KEY MESSAGES: Ascorbic acid inhibits tumor growth by inducing ROS generation. As a mitochondrial respiration inhibitor, metformin inhibits cellular oxygen consumption rate to improve oxygenation of prostate cancer. Metformin enhances anti-tumor effect of ascorbic acid by increasing ROS content.

We compared the performance of TB, SB and the combined approach (CB) in biopsy-naive men to determine the added value of SB for tumor grading and spatial tumor distribution.  Methods:   Two hundred and fifty-nine men with PI-RADS 3-5 graded lesions who underwent CB were enrolled. Data were prospectively collected, and cancer detection rates (CDR) were compared at patient and lesion level. Gleason grade up- and down-grading from biopsy to prostatectomy specimens (n = 56; 21.6%) were determined. Clinically significant cancer (csPCA) was defined as Gleason grade ≥ 2.  Results:   CDR by CB based on PI-RADS categories 3, 4 and 5 for PCA were 24%, 72% and 98% and 17%, 64% and 96% for csPCA. CB detected more PCA and csPCA than TB (p < 0.001). However, TB showed higher efficiency, defined as CDR per biopsy core, for PCA and csPCA in PI-RADS 4-5 rated patients (p < 0.001). Concordance between biopsy and prostatectomy grading was highest in CB with misdiagnosis of csPCA in 25% of men. TB missed cancer attributed to the index lesion in 10.2% and underestimated csPCA in 7%. In these cases, 76% of csPCA were detected and 85% were upgraded to csPCA by SB in adjacent sectors.  Conclusion:   SB cannot be safely abundant without increased diagnostic uncertainty. When TB missed csPCA, SB detected it close to the MRI-target lesion.

The most appropriate algorithm for population-based screening is unknown.  Methods:   We invited 37,887 men who were 50 to 60 years of age to undergo regular prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. Participants with a PSA level of 3 ng per milliliter or higher underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the prostate; one third of the participants were randomly assigned to a reference group that underwent systematic biopsy as well as targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions shown on MRI. The remaining participants were assigned to the experimental group and underwent MRI-targeted biopsy only. The primary outcome was clinically insignificant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score of 3+3. The secondary outcome was clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as a Gleason score of at least 3+4. Safety was also assessed.  Results:   Of the men who were invited to undergo screening, 17,980 (47%) participated in the trial. A total of 66 of the 11,986 participants in the experimental group (0.6%) received a diagnosis of clinically insignificant prostate cancer, as compared with 72 of 5994 participants (1.2%) in the reference group, a difference of -0.7 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.0 to -0.4; relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.64; P<0.001). The relative risk of clinically significant prostate cancer in the experimental group as compared with the reference group was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.1). Clinically significant cancer that was detected only by systematic biopsy was diagnosed in 10 participants in the reference group; all cases were of intermediate risk and involved mainly low-volume disease that was managed with active surveillance. Serious adverse events were rare (<0.1%) in the two groups.  Conclusions:   The avoidance of systematic biopsy in favor of MRI-directed targeted biopsy for screening and early detection in persons with elevated PSA levels reduced the risk of overdiagnosis by half at the cost of delaying detection of intermediate-risk tumors in a small proportion of patients.

Methods and materials:   Fifteen patients with prostate cancer who had a low- to intermediate-risk marker implanted received UF-SBRT with online 2D-kV image tracking and a manual beam interruption strategy with a 2-mm motion threshold. A total of 180 kV paired setup images and 1272 intrabeam 2D-kV images were analyzed to evaluate the setup deviation and intratreatment target deviation. Correlation of expected treatment interruptions with a set of parameters (eg, image and treatment time; direction of deviation) was performed (Spearman test). A subset of the data from 22 fractions was re-evaluated to check the differences in analysis results between using the planning position and using the pretreatment setup position as a reference. Margins based on the derived system and random errors were calculated to evaluate the feasibility of the workflow in ensuring prostate coverage during treatment.  Results:   Mean target motion in 3D propagated from 1.0 mm (setup at 0 minutes) to 2.0 mm (beam on at 7 minutes) to 2.4 mm (end at 13.5 minutes). Out of 75 fractions, 50 were found to require beam interruption. Interruption had a strong correlation with prostate motion along the longitudinal direction and had moderate correlation with prostate motion along the vertical direction and the prostate's treatment starting position along vertical and longitudinal directions. Using the pretreatment position as a reference for intrabeam monitoring, the magnitude of motion deviation from the reference position was reduced by 0.3 mm at a vertical direction and 0.4 mm at lateral and longitudinal directions. The calculated 3D margin to ensure target coverage was 3.7 mm, 4.6 mm, and 5.0 mm in lateral, vertical, and longitudinal directions, respectively.

PALI1 further interacts with the H3K9 methyltransferase G9A, bridging the formation of a unique G9A-PALI1-PRC2 super-complex that occupies a subset of G9A-target genes to mediate dual H3K9/K27 methylation and gene repression. Many of these genes are developmental regulators required for cell differentiation, and their loss in PCa predicts poor prognosis. Accordingly, PALI1 and G9A drive PCa cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo.

In patients with prostate cancer, PET using targeted radiotracers can identify increased activity in small morphologically normal lymph nodes, facilitating earlier detection of metastatic disease. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article was to assess the efficacy and safety of CT-guided biopsy of suspicious pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes measuring smaller than 1 cm detected by 11C-choline PET in patients with prostate cancer, with comparison with nodes measuring 1 cm or larger. METHODS. This retrospective study included patients with prostate cancer who underwent CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of suspicious pelvic or retroperitoneal lymph nodes detected by 11C-choline PET/CT or PET/MRI (performed because of a rising or elevated PSA level or known recurrent or metastatic disease) between June 1, 2012, and March 20, 2020. Patient, lymph node, and procedural characteristics, as well as biopsy outcomes and complications, were recorded. Biopsies of lymph nodes measuring smaller than 1 cm and of lymph nodes measuring 1 cm and larger were compared. RESULTS. A total of 269 patients (mean age, 68.7 ± 6.8 [SD] years) were included. A total of 156 patients underwent biopsy of lymph nodes measuring smaller than 1 cm (range, 3-9 mm); 113 patients underwent biopsy of lymph nodes measuring 1 cm or larger (range, 10-35 mm). Lymph nodes smaller than 1 cm and lymph nodes 1 cm and larger showed no significant difference in diagnostic yield (89.7% vs 92.9%; p = .40). Diagnostic yield was not significantly different between nodes smaller than 1 cm and nodes 1 cm and larger for any individual anatomic location within the pelvis or retroperitoneum (all p > .05). Malignant yield was lower for nodes smaller than 1 cm than for nodes 1 cm and larger (44.9% vs 63.7%; p = .003). The single biopsied 3-mm node had a nondiagnostic specimen. Diagnostic yield and malignant yield were 100.0% and 40.0%, respectively, for 4-mm nodes, and 95.5% and 45.5%, respectively, for 5-mm nodes. Patients with nodes smaller than 1 cm and nodes 1 cm and larger showed no significant difference in minor (12.8% vs 7.1%; p = .16) or major (0.6% vs 2.7%; p = .31) complication rate. CONCLUSION. The findings support the safety and efficacy of CT-guided biopsy of suspicious subcentimeter pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes detected on 11C-choline PET in patients with prostate cancer.

Our objective was to determine long-term population-level oncological outcomes in active surveillance patients. A secondary objective examined the active surveillance discontinuation rate.  Materials and methods:   In this retrospective, population-based study using linked administrative databases from Ontario, Canada, we identified low-grade prostate cancer patients managed with active surveillance or initial treatment between 2002-2014. The 10- and 15-year metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and cancer-specific survival were compared between active surveillance and initial treatment. A landmark of 24 months was selected for the primary analysis. Long-term outcomes were examined using multivariable proportional hazards models and a propensity-based approach.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 21,282 low-grade prostate cancer patients with a median follow-up of 9.8 years. At 10-year follow-up the survival rate of remaining on active surveillance was 39%, metastasis-free survival was 94.2%, overall survival 88.7%, and cancer-specific survival 98.1%. In adjusted models active surveillance was associated with higher risk of metastasis (HR 1.34, 95%CI 1.15-1.57), overall mortality (HR 1.12, 95%CI 1.01-1.24), and prostate cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.66, 95%CI 1.15-2.39) compared to initial treatment. Survival analysis using 7,525 propensity-matched pairs was consistent with the primary analysis for metastasis-free survival, overall survival and cancer-specific survival.  Conclusions:   In this large population-based study of long-term outcomes in men with low-grade prostate cancer, active surveillance is associated with excellent long-term metastasis-free survival and overall survival. However, long-term cancer-specific survival was slightly inferior (1% worse at 10 years with active surveillance), and this must be balanced against known harms of overtreatment.""","""['N Timilshina', 'S M H Alibhai', 'G Tomlinson', 'B Sander', 'D C Cheung', 'A Finelli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Point-Counterpoint: Active Surveillance Should Still Be Preferred Management for All (or Nearly All) Men With Low-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Long-term Outcomes Following Active Surveillance of Low-grade Prostate Cancer: A Population-based Study Using a Landmark Approach.

Herein, we aimed to identify meaningful lncRNA biomarkers associated with prostate cancer metastatic progression.  Methods:   By repurposing microarray probes, 11,624 lncRNAs in prostate cancer were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE46691, N = 545; GSE29079, N = 235; GSE94767, N = 130). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was applied to determine the co-expression lncRNA network pertinent to metastasis. Hub lncRNAs were screened. RNA-seq and clinical data from the Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cancer (TCGA-PRAD) cohort (N = 531) were analyzed. Transwell assay and bioinformatic analysis were performed for mechanism research.  Results:   The high expression levels of nine hub lncRNAs (FTX, AC005261.1, NORAD, LINC01578, AC004542.2, ZFAS1, EBLN3P, THUMPD3-AS1, GAS5) were significantly associated with Gleason score and increased probability of metastatic progression. Among these lncRNAs, ZFAS1 had the consistent trends of expression in all of the analysis from different cohorts, and the Kaplan-Meier survival analyses showed higher expression of ZFAS1 was associated with shorter relapse free survival. In-vitro studies confirmed that downregulation of ZFAS1 decreased prostate cancer cell migration.  Conclusion:   We offered some new insights into discovering lncRNA markers correlated with metastatic progression of prostate cancer using the WGCNA.

This study aimed to assess the association between comorbidities and perceived health status (PHS) of US persons with cancer.  Methods:   This cross-sectional study used 2019 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data and included individuals who were alive throughout the year, aged 18 to 84 years, and had diagnosis for cancer. Using adjusted logistic regression models, we estimated the association of comorbidities (no, few [1/2], and more [3 or more] comorbidities) with PHS. Analyses accounted for the complex design of MEPS.  Results:   The dataset included 28,512 participants, 1739 of which were eligible for the study. Of these, 11.16% (95% CI 9.64, 12.59%); 41.73% (95% CI 39.21, 43.96%); and 47.10% (95% CI 44.86, 49.73%) reported having no, few, and more comorbidities, respectively. While breast (N = 356), prostate (N = 276), and melanoma (N = 273) were the most common cancers, hypertension (88.3%), hypercholesterolemia (49.5%), and arthritis (48%) were the most prevalent comorbidities. Adjusted logistic regression showed that, compared with those with no comorbidities, persons with few and more comorbidities had 1.58 (95% CI = 0.79, 3.15) and 2.27 (95% CI = 1.19, 4.32) times greater odds of poor PHS. Younger or male patients, those with less formal education, low-income, pain, functional limitation, or poor perception of mental health were more likely to regard their health as poor.  Conclusion:   About 88% of persons with history of cancer in the USA aged 18-84 years reported at least one comorbidity. Having more comorbidities, along with several other variables, was associated with poor PHS.

Germline BAP1 pathogenic variants are rare in the non-cancer general population with an estimated carrier frequency of 1:19,898 but more common in cancer patients with a carrier frequency of 1:1299. In the following we present the first report of a family with two unique BAP1 pathogenic variants. Retrospective case report of a family with two unique pathogenic variants in BAP1. A male (proband) was referred to our ocular oncology clinic for second opinion for his multiple independent uveal melanomas at ages 65, 68 and 71. Given his personal history of squamous cell carcinoma at age 61, renal cell carcinoma at age 63, and family history of atypical meningioma, basal cell carcinoma, pancreatic and prostate cancers he was assessed for germline pathogenic variants in BAP1 through our ongoing research study. Sanger sequencing identified the American founder pathogenic variant, c.1717delC, pL573Wfs*3, that was confirmed in a clinical laboratory. Both the proband's brother and nephew tested negative for the familial variant through single site cascade genetic testing. However, based on the personal history of multiple basal cell carcinoma in the nephew and family history of pancreatic and laryngeal cancers (both not known to be associated with BAP1-TPDS), a large cancer panel testing was recommended for the nephew. His panel testing revealed a different BAP1 pathogenic variant, c.605G>A, p. Trp202*. This variant was not detected in the proband or the proband's brother. Based on the frequency of germline BAP1 variants in the cancer population, the chance of occurrence of two different BAP1 variants in a family with cancer history is 5.9 × 10-7. This case report provides support for the importance of offering large panel cascade genetic testing, rather than single site testing for only the family pathogenic variant, for all at risk family members especially when the family variant cannot explain all the cancers in the family.""","""['Lindsey Byrne', 'Cana Ingalls', 'Aliya Ansari', 'Cassie Porteus', 'Talia R Donenberg', 'Daniel A Sussman', 'Colleen M Cebulla', 'Mohamed H Abdel-Rahman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Fam Cancer""","""['BAP1 Tumor Predisposition Syndrome.', 'BAP1 germline variants in Finnish patients with malignant mesothelioma.', 'Comprehensive Study of the Clinical Phenotype of Germline BAP1 Variant-Carrying Families Worldwide.', 'Comparison of Germline versus Somatic BAP1 Mutations for Risk of Metastasis in Uveal Melanoma.', 'BAP1 Germline Mutations in Finnish Patients with Uveal Melanoma.']"""

Methods:   The present study included 156 patients who did not have preoperative OAB and underwent RARP between December 2015 and April 2020 at our institution. Patients were divided into the de novo OAB group and non-OAB group based on the findings of overactive bladder symptoms score (OABSS) 6 months after RARP, and comparative assessments were performed between the two groups.  Results:   Six months after RARP, de novo OAB was detected in 38 (24.4%) out of 156 patients.

Organoids are 3D in vitro cell cultures that may better recapitulate disease heterogeneity and retain parental tumor characteristics. Short-term ex vivo culture of PCa tissues may also facilitate drug testing in personalized medicine.  Materials and methods:   For organoid culture, we have processed both cancer and normal tissues from 50 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate. In addition, we exploited the ex vivo tissue culture technique and performed short-term chemotherapy assay using gemcitabine and Chk1 inhibitor MU380 in 10 patient samples.  Results:   In total, we were able to cultivate organoids from 58% of tumors (29/50) and 69% of normal tissue (20/29). Immunohistochemical staining of two representative cases revealed cell positivity for pan-cytokeratin confirming the presence of epithelial cells. However, the overexpression of AMACR and ERG proteins in tumors was not recapitulated in organoids. Another limitation was the propagation of organoids only up to 3 weeks till the first passage. Next, a short-term drug test was performed for ten patients using ex vivo tissue culture. Samples from prostatectomies mostly presented a low proliferation rate as assessed by Ki-67 staining. Another drawback of this ap-proach was inconsistent tissue morphology among particular tissue fragments. Only one case showed a high proliferation rate for drug testing and tumor tissue was present in all tested samples. In our work, we also provide an overview of recent studies and a detailed comparison of culture conditions.  Conclusion:   We have established cultures of both organoids and tissue fragments from PCa patient samples. However, the expression of tumor markers was not recapitulated in organoids. Inconsistent morphology among tissue fragments and low proliferation hampered the interpretation of the drug testing in most cases.

Results:   In 3 cases (37.5%), the 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was positive, whereas histological examination confirmed 2 serous ovarian cancer cases and 1 ovarian borderline tumor. The SUV max in the serous ovarian cancer was 8.7 and 4.1, and in the borderline ovarian tumor, it was 13.8. No correlation was found between antigen CA-125 level and 68 Ga-PSMA expression. Range of tumor SUV max was not correlated with stage of disease. The remaining 62.5% (5/8) were negative in 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and histopathology confirmed benign pelvic tumor.

Previous literature suggests disparities in CaP outcomes according to ethnicity, specifically functional and oncological are suboptimal in black men. However, recent data shows black men achieve post radical prostatectomy (RP) outcomes equivalent to white men in a universally insured system. Our objective is to compare outcomes of patients who self-identified their ethnicity as black or white undergoing RP at our institution.  Materials and methods:   From 2008 to 2017, 396 black and 4929 white patients underwent primary robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Exclusion criteria were concomitant surgery and cancer status not available. A propensity score (PS) match was performed with a 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 ratio without replacement. Primary endpoints were potency, continence recovery, biochemical recurrence (BCR), positive surgical margins (PSM), and post-operative complications.  Results:   After PS 1:1 matching, 341 black vs. 341 white men with a median follow-up of approximately 8 years were analyzed. The overall potency and continence recovery at 12 months was 52% vs 58% (p=0.3) and 82% vs 89% (p=0.3), respectively. PSM rates was 13.4 % vs 14.4% (p = 0.75). Biochemical recurrence and persistence PSA was 13.8% vs 14.1% and 4.4% vs 3.2% respectively (p=0.75). Clavien-Dindo complications (p=0.4) and 30-day readmission rates (p=0.5) were similar.  Conclusion:   In our study, comparing two ethnic groups with similar preoperative characteristics and full access to screening and treatment showed compatible RARP results. We could not demonstrate outcomes superiority in one group over the other. However, this data adds to the growing body of evidence that the racial disparity gap in prostate cancer outcomes can be narrowed if patients have appropriate access to prostate cancer management. It also could be used in counseling surgeons and patients on the surgical intervention and prognosis of prostate cancer in patients with full access to gold-standard screening and treatment.""","""['Jonathan Noël', 'Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Marco Sandri', 'Abdel Rahman Jaber', 'Travis Rogers', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Determinants of variation in radical local treatment for men with high-risk localised or locally advanced prostate cancer in England.', 'Retrograde Release of the Neurovascular Bundle with Preservation of Dorsal Venous Complex During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Optimizing Functional Outcomes.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Retzius-sparing versus standard robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of urinary continence recovery among patients with urinary incontinence immediately after surgery (UIIAS).  Materials and methods:   We identified 274 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent LRP and RALP between 2011 and 2018. UIIAS was defined as a urine loss ratio > 0.15 on the first day of urethral catheter removal. Urinary continence recovery was defined as using ≤ 1 pad/day one year after surgery. In the present study, we evaluated factors affecting urinary function recovery one year after surgery among patients with urinary incontinence immediately after LRP and RALP.  Results:   UIIAS was observed in 191 out of 274 patients (69.7%). A multivariate analysis identified age (<65 years, p = 0.015) as an independent predictor affecting immediate urinary continence. Among 191 incontinent patients, urinary continence one year after surgery improved in 153 (80.1%). A multivariate analysis identified age (<65 years, p = 0.003) and estimated blood loss (≥ 100 mL, p = 0.044) as independent predictors affecting urinary continence recovery one year after surgery.

Methods:   Sixty-five patients (mean age ± SD, 67 years ± 6.3) treated with radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer who underwent 1.5-Tesla multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) 6 months before surgery were enrolled. sEPE grade was derived from mpMRI metrics: curvilinear contact length > 15 mm (CCL) and capsular bulging/irregularity. The diameter of the index lesion (dIL) was also measured. Evaluations were independently performed by seven radiologists, and inter-reader agreement was tested by weighted Cohen K coefficient. A nested (two levels) Monte Carlo cross-validation was used. The best cut-off value for dIL was selected by means of the Youden J index to classify values into a binary variable termed dIL*. Logistic regression models based on sEPE grade, dIL, and clinical scores were developed to predict pathologic EPE. Results on validation set were assessed by the main metrics of the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and by decision curve analysis (DCA). Based on our findings, we defined and tested an alternative sEPE grade formulation.  Results:   Pathologic EPE was found in 31/65 (48%) patients. Average κw was 0.65 (95% CI 0.51-0.79), 0.66 (95% CI 0.48-0.84), 0.67 (95% CI 0.50-0.84), and 0.43 (95% CI 0.22-0.63) for sEPE grading, CLL ≥ 15 mm, dIL*, and capsular bulging/irregularity, respectively. The highest diagnostic yield in predicting EPE was obtained by combining both sEPE grade and dIL*(ROC-AUC 0.81).  Conclusions:   sEPE grade is reproducible and when combined with the dIL* accurately predicts extraprostatic tumor extension.

Literature on inter- and intra - observer agreement of MUL measurement is limited. We studied the inter- and intra-observer agreement between radiologists using a well-defined method to measure the MUL on the prostate MRI.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients underwent a preoperative MRI and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) at one high-volume RARP center. MUL measurement was based on well-defined landmarks on sagittal T2-weighted (anatomical) images. Three radiologists independently performed MUL measurements retrospectively in 106 patients blinded to themselves, to each other, and to clinical outcomes. The inter- and intra-observer agreement of MUL measurement between the radiologists were calculated, expressed as intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results:   The initial inter-observer agreement was ICC 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.28-0.81. Radiologist 3 measured the MUL mean 3.9 mm (SD 3.3) longer than the other readers, interpreting the caudal point of the MUL (penile base) differently. After discussion on the correct anatomical definition, radiologist 3 re-assessed all scans, which resulted in a high inter-observer agreement (ICC 0.84; 95% CI 0.66-0.91). After a subsequent reading by radiologists 1 and 2, the intra-observer agreements were ICC 0.93; 95% CI 0.89-0.96, and ICC 0.98; 95% CI 0.97-0.98, respectively. Limitation is the monocenter design.  Conclusions:   The MUL can be measured reliably with high agreement among radiologists.  Key points:   • After discussion on the correct anatomical definition, the inter- and intra - observer agreements of membranous urethral length (MUL) measurement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were high. • A reproducible method to measure the MUL can improve the clinical usefulness of prediction models for urinary continence after RARP which may benefit patient counselling.""","""['Hans Veerman', 'Marinus J Hagens', 'Caroline M Hoeks', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'André N Vis', 'Stijn W T J P Heijmink', 'Ivo G Schoots', 'Margriet C de Haan', 'Thierry N Boellaard']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Association Between Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Urethral Parameters and Continence Recovery Following Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Value of Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Measurements of Anatomical Structures on Preoperative Prostate Imaging in Predicting Urinary Continence After Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Inter-observer variability in male pelvic-floor MRI measurements that might predict post-prostatectomy incontinence.', 'The effect of preoperative membranous urethral length on likelihood of postoperative urinary incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Preoperative Membranous Urethral Length Measurement and Continence Recovery Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.']"""

Most previous studies have focused on the identification of prognostic biomarkers in the prostate cancer tumor. However, it is increasingly recognized that the tumor microenvironment contributes to prostate cancer aggressiveness and progression. We therefore examined whole transcriptome expression of the prostate stroma and associations with aggressive and lethal prostate cancer. We performed RNA sequencing (Illumina TruSeq Exome Capture) of 272 tumor-adjacent and 120 benign-adjacent macrodissected prostate stromal samples from 293 men with prostate cancer from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study. We performed differential expression analysis comparing gene expression and pathways by Gleason score and lethal outcome. We also tested a previously developed stromal gene signature of Gleason score in these datasets. Comparing high- with low-Gleason score cancers, 26 genes (P < 0.001) and 12 pathways (FDR < 0.20) were significantly differentially expressed in tumor-adjacent stroma, including pathways related to stroma composition remodeling and DNA repair, with 73 genes and 65 pathways significant in benign-adjacent stroma. Comparing lethal with nonlethal prostate cancer, 11 genes were differentially expressed in tumor-adjacent and 15 genes in benign-adjacent stroma, and pathways involved in inflammatory response were differentially enriched in both tumor and benign-adjacent stroma. In addition, our previously identified Gleason stromal gene signature was validated to be associated with Gleason score in these data. Implications: Our study uncovers stroma-specific genes and pathways that are differentially enriched with high Gleason score and lethal prostate cancer, demonstrating that the molecular investigation of the tumor microenvironment can provide additional information about prostate cancer prognosis.""","""['Chaoran Ma#', 'Yinglu Zhou#', 'Giuseppe Nicolò Fanelli', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Michelangelo Fiorentino', 'Giorgia Zadra', 'Lorelei A Mucci', 'Massimo Loda', 'Svitlana Tyekucheva#', 'Kathryn L Penney#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['A distinct repertoire of cancer-associated fibroblasts is enriched in cribriform prostate cancer.', 'Asporin is a stromally expressed marker associated with prostate cancer progression.', 'Integrative metabolic and transcriptomic profiling of prostate cancer tissue containing reactive stroma.', 'Stress-Related Signaling Pathways in Lethal and Nonlethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Functional validation of metabolic genes that distinguish Gleason 3 from Gleason 4 prostate cancer foci.', 'Distinct mesenchymal cell states mediate prostate cancer progression.']"""

Purpose To assess how Gleason grade, maximum cancer core length (MCCL), inflammation, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN), or atypical small acinar proliferation within a Barzell zone affects the odds of MRI visibility. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the Prostate MRI Imaging Study (PROMIS; May 2012 to November 2015), consecutive participants who underwent multiparametric MRI followed by a combined biopsy, including 5-mm transperineal mapping (TPM), were evaluated. TPM pathologic findings were reported at the whole-prostate level and for each of 20 Barzell zones per prostate. An expert panel blinded to the pathologic findings reviewed MRI scans and declared which Barzell areas spanned Likert score 3-5 lesions. The relationship of Gleason grade and MCCL to zonal MRI outcome (visible vs nonvisible) was assessed using generalized linear mixed-effects models with random intercepts for individual participants. Inflammation, PIN, and atypical small acinar proliferation were similarly assessed in men who had negative TPM results. Results Overall, 161 men (median age, 62 years [IQR, 11 years]) were evaluated and 3179 Barzell zones were assigned MRI status. Compared with benign areas, the odds of MRI visibility were higher when a zone contained cancer with a Gleason score of 3+4 (odds ratio [OR], 3.1; 95% CI: 1.9, 4.9; P < .001) or Gleason score greater than or equal to 4+3 (OR, 8.7; 95% CI: 4.5, 17.0; P < .001). MCCL also determined visibility (OR, 1.24 per millimeter increase; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.33; P < .001), but odds were lower with each prostate volume doubling (OR, 0.7; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.9). In men who were TPM-negative, the presence of PIN increased the odds of zonal visibility (OR, 3.7; 95% CI: 1.5, 9.1; P = .004). Conclusion An incremental relationship between cancer burden and prostate MRI visibility was observed. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia contributed to false-positive MRI findings.

We observe an expansion of a castration-resistant intermediate luminal cell type that correlates with treatment resistance and poor prognosis in human patients. Moreover, transformed epithelial cells and associated fibroblasts create a microenvironment conducive to pro-tumorigenic immune infiltration, which is partially androgen responsive. Androgen-independent prostate cancer leads to significant diversification of intermediate luminal cell populations characterized by a range of androgen signaling activity, which is inversely correlated with proliferation and mRNA translation. Accordingly, distinct epithelial populations are exquisitely sensitive to translation inhibition, which leads to epithelial cell death, loss of pro-tumorigenic signaling, and decreased tumor heterogeneity.

Purpose:   The purpose of this study was to improve the conspicuity of high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy needles under B-mode ultrasound imaging by applying an echogenic surface coating. Our hypothesis was that an echogenic coating would reduce artifacts and improve needle visualization within regions of signal degradation.  Methods:   In this study, 17-gauge, 25-cm long titanium HDR brachytherapy needles were coated with acoustically reflective microspheres over a 2.5 cm region starting from the needle tip. Three coating thicknesses (27 μm, 40 μm, 64 μm) were compared against an uncoated control needle. The coated and uncoated needles were imaged using B-mode ultrasound in a tissue-equivalent prostate phantom and in a cadaverous male pelvis using a transrectal probe. Needle conspicuity was assessed under multiple conditions: a single needle implant, an implant with multiple needles between the probe and the needle of interest, and an angled needle implant. All images were assessed qualitatively for needle conspicuity and the presence of artifacts and quantitatively using grey-scale image intensity values.  Results:   The 64 μm echogenic coating reduced the magnitude of reverberation artifacts by 31 ± 14% and comet tail artifacts by 40%-70%. The echogenic coating also improved needle contrast, measured by the relative differences in signal intensity compared with the adjacent environment, when needles were angled up to 30° with respect to the transducer probe in the cadaver. The improvements in conspicuity and artifact reduction increased with increasing coating thickness. The performance of the needles coated with the 64 μm thickness was qualitatively superior and yielded high-contrast, well-circumscribed signals in the cadaverous male pelvis, even under situations where a needle was acoustically shadowed by multiple other needles.  Conclusions:   An echogenic surface coating reduced imaging artifacts and improved needle conspicuity under realistic clinical conditions for ultrasound-based prostate or gynecological brachytherapy.

We additionally investigated oncological outcomes based on economic status and residential area in patients who underwent surgical treatment.  Materials and methods:   The study included 75,518 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer between 2009 and 2018 in whom oncological outcomes were investigated based on economic status and residential area. Among the 75,518 men with prostate cancer, the data of 29,973 men who underwent radical prostatectomy were further analyzed. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the effects of economic status and residential area on postoperative oncological outcomes.  Results:   Among the 75,518 patients with prostate cancer, 3,254 (4.31%) were medical aid beneficiaries. The 5-year overall survival rates were 81.2% and 64.8% in the health insurance and medical aid groups, respectively. Radical prostatectomy was more common in the health insurance group, and surgical intervention was significantly affected by the residential area. Among patients who underwent surgery, 5-year androgen deprivation therapy-free and overall survival were better in the health insurance group. Multivariate analysis showed that insurance type and residential area were significantly associated with the androgen deprivation therapy-free and overall survival after adjustment for other variables.  Conclusion:   Economic status and residential area were shown to affect not only treatment patterns but also post-diagnosis and postoperative oncological outcomes.

Numerous factors intervene in the onset and progression of lung tumors, among which the participation of lineage-specific transcription factors stands out. Several transcription factors important in embryonic development are abnormally expressed in adult tissues and thus participate in the activation of signaling pathways related to the acquisition of the tumor phenotype. RUNX2 is the transcription factor responsible for osteogenic differentiation in mammals. Current studies have confirmed that RUNX2 is closely related to the proliferation, invasion, and bone metastasis of multiple cancer types, such as osteosarcoma, breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. Thus, the present study is aimed at evaluating the role of the RUNX2 transcription factor in inhibiting the apoptosis process. Loss-of-function assays using sh-RNA from lentiviral particles and coupled with Annexin/propidium iodide (PI) assays (flow cytometry), immunofluorescence, and quantitative PCR analysis of genes related to cell apoptosis (BAD, BAX, BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1) were performed. Silencing assays and Annexin/PI assays demonstrated that when RUNX2 was absent, the percentage of dead cells increased, and the expression levels of the BCL2, BCL-XL, and MCL1 genes were downregulated. Furthermore, to confirm whether the regulatory role of RUNX2 in the expression of these genes is related to its binding to the promoter region, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. Here, we report that overexpression of the RUNX2 gene in lung cancer may be related to the inhibition of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, specifically, through direct transcriptional regulation of the antiapoptotic gene BCL2 and indirect regulation of BCL-XL and MCL1.""","""['Camila Bernal', 'Andrea Otalora', 'Alejandra Cañas', 'Alfonso Barreto', 'Karol Prieto', 'Martin Montecino', 'Adriana Rojas']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Cell Biol""","""['Runx2-mediated activation of the Bax gene increases osteosarcoma cell sensitivity to apoptosis.', 'Bicalutamide-induced hypoxia potentiates RUNX2-mediated Bcl-2 expression resulting in apoptosis resistance.', 'Role of RUNX2 transcription factor in epithelial mesenchymal transition in non-small cell lung cancer lung cancer: Epigenetic control of the RUNX2 P1 promoter.', 'Metastatic breast cancer cells inhibit osteoblast differentiation through the Runx2/CBFβ-dependent expression of the Wnt antagonist, sclerostin.', 'Regulatory roles of Runx2 in metastatic tumor and cancer cell interactions with bone.', 'RUNX2 and Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Firstly, the effects of A14 on the ability of leukemia cells to proliferate were measured by Vi-cell counter. Then, we detected the cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry and characterized the related protein expression using immunoblotting. In addition, we constructed stable luciferase expressing cell lines for use in a cell derived xenograft mouse model to measure the effect of A14 on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Results:   Results exhibited that A14 markedly suppressed cell proliferation and induced G2/M phase arrest along with cell cycles regulating proteins changes. A14 led to apoptosis in leukemia cells, at least partly, through the cytochrome c signaling pathway. Experiments in cell derived xenograft mouse model also showed that A14 markedly ameliorated the survival rate.

RNASeq was used to characterize the immune response in the tumor. Immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and in vivo blocking studies confirmed the role of cell surface proteins in the generation of immune responses. In The Cancer Genome Atlas, PAK4 expression was inversely correlated with immune cell infiltration. PAK4 expression was controlled by the androgen receptor and its pioneering factor, FOXA1. PAK4 KD increased CD8+ T-cell infiltration and expression of IFNγ response genes. PAK4 KD also upregulated angiogenesis and endothelial cell adhesion molecules in the tumor microenvironment, contributing to CD8+ lymphocyte recruitment. Pharmacological inhibition of PAK4 made PC more responsive to immunotherapy with αPD1.

With daily adaptive radiation therapy, these interfractional changes could be minimized, potentially reducing the margins required for treatment and improving adjacent normal-tissue dosimetry.  Methods and materials:   A single-center retrospective study was conducted from March 2021 to November 2021. Patients receiving conventionally fractionated postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) for prostate cancer with pretreatment and posttreatment cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging (pre-CBCT and post-CBCT, respectively) were included (248 paired images). Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical target volumes (pre-CTVs and post-CTVs) were contoured by a single observer on all CBCTs and verified by a second observer. Motion was calculated from pre-CTV to that of the post-CTV, and predicted margins were calculated with van Herk's formula. Adequate coverage of the proposed planning target volume (PTV) margin expansions (pre-PTV) were verified by determining overlap with post-CTV. In a smaller cohort (25 paired images), dosimetric changes with the proposed online adaptive margins were compared with conventional plans in the Ethos emulator environment.  Results:   The estimated margins predicted to achieve ≥95% CTV coverage for 90% of the population were 1.6 mm, 2.0 mm, and 2.2 mm (x-, y-, and z -xes, respectively), with 95% of the absolute region of interest displacement being within 1.9 mm, 2.8 mm, and 2.1 mm. After symmetrically expanding all pre-CTVs by 3 mm, the percentage of paired images achieving ≥95% CTV coverage was 97.1%. When comparing adaptive plans (3-mm margins) with scheduled plans (7-mm margins), rectum dosimetry significantly improved, with an average relative reduction in V40Gy[cc] of 59.2% and V65Gy[cc] of 79.5% (where V40Gy and V65Gy are defined as the volumes receiving 40 Gy and 65 Gy or higher dose, respectively).

However, nearly all patients receiving DTX therapy ultimately progress to DTX resistance. How to address DTX resistance in PCa remains a key challenge for all urologists. Small ankyrin 1 (sAnk1) is an integral membrane protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. In the present study, we identified that sAnk1 is upregulated in PCa tissues and is positively associated with DTX therapy resistance in PCa. Further investigation demonstrated that overexpression of sAnk1 can significantly increase the DTX-resistant ability of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, overexpression of sAnk1 could enhance oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) levels in PCa cells, which was consistent with the higher OXPHOS levels observed in DTX-resistant PCa cells as compared to DTX-sensitive PCa cells. sAnk1 was also found to interact with polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein (PTBP1), an alternative splicing factor, and suppressed PTBP1-mediated alternative splicing of the pyruvate kinase gene (PKM). Thus, overexpression of sAnk1 decreased the ratio of PKM2/PKM1, enhanced the OXPHOS level, and ultimately promoted the resistance of PCa cells to DTX. In summary, our data suggest that sAnk1 enhances DTX resistance in PCa cells.""","""['Yang Yang', 'Haixiang Qin', 'Meng Ding', 'Changwei Ji', 'Wei Chen', 'Wenli Diao', 'Haoli Yin', 'Mengxia Chen', 'Weidong Gan', 'Hongqian Guo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""FEBS Open Bio""","""['Overexpression of claspin promotes docetaxel resistance and is associated with prostate-specific antigen recurrence in prostate cancer.', 'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'Targeting TR4 nuclear receptor with antagonist bexarotene increases docetaxel sensitivity to better suppress the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progression.', 'Protein Disulfide Isomerase 4 Drives Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Advanced radiotherapy technologies enable treatment with large fractions and highly conformal radiation doses to effect free-radical damage to cellular DNA leading to cell-cycle arrest, cell death, and innate immune response (IIR) stimulation.  Experimental design:   To understand systemic clinical responses after radiation exposure, proteomic and metabolomic analyses were performed on plasma obtained from patients with cancer at intervals after prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy. Pathway and multivariate analyses were used to delineate molecular alterations following radiotherapy and its correlation with clinical outcomes.  Results:   DNA damage response increased within the first hour after treatment and returned to baseline by 1 month. IIR signaling also increased within 1 hour of treatment but persisted for up to 3 months thereafter. Furthermore, robust IIR and metabolite elevations, consistent with an early proinflammatory M1-mediated innate immune activation, were observed in patients in remission, whereas patients experiencing prostate serum antigen-determined disease progression demonstrated less robust immune responses and M2-mediated metabolite elevations.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, these data are the first report of longitudinal proteomic and metabolomic molecular responses in patients after radiotherapy for cancers. The data supports innate immune activation as a critical clinical response of patients receiving radiotherapy for prostate cancer. Furthermore, we propose that the observed IIR may be generalized to the treatment of other cancer types, potentially informing multidisciplinary therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.""","""['Amrita K Cheema', 'Yaoxiang Li', 'Mary Ventimiglia', 'Keith Kowalczyk', 'Ryan Hankins', 'Gaurav Bandi', 'Einsley-Marie Janowski', 'Scott Grindrod', 'Alejandro Villagra', 'Anatoly Dritschilo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Preliminary results of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy as salvage treatment for a rising prostate-specific antigen level postprostatectomy.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Salvage radiotherapy with or without short-term hormone therapy for rising prostate-specific antigen concentration after radical prostatectomy (GETUG-AFU 16): a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase 3 trial.', 'External beam radiotherapy versus radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2 prostate cancer: therapeutic implications of stratification by pretreatment PSA levels and biopsy Gleason scores.', 'Curative radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer.

Patchouli alcohol (PA) has been shown to have an anti-cancer effect, including in prostate cancer (PCa). This study sought to confirm the regulatory mechanism of GPBAR1 in the anti-cancer activity of PA in PCa.  Methods:   The SwissTargetPrediction website (Pro >0) was used to predict the target of PA. The UALCAN and The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate cohort was used to examine the differentially expressed genes and PCa recurrence. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was conducted to analyze the relationship between the expression of GPBAR1 and PCa proliferation, migration, and invasion. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed by colony formation, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine staining, cell scratch assays, and Transwell invasion assays, respectively. A xenograft animal model was established to assess the effect of PA on tumor growth in vivo. GPBAR1 protein and apoptosis related protein expression was measured by western blot.  Results:   GPBAR1 was a PA target predicted by the SwissTargetPrediction website. PA inhibited the expression of GPBAR1 in PCa cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The abnormal expression of GPBAR1 was related to cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Additionally, GPBAR1 overexpression promoted the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and inhibited the apoptosis of PCa cells. GPBAR1 silencing inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promoted the apoptosis of PCa cells. High expressions of GPBAR1 suppressed tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice. Further, GPBAR1 promoted the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling, and PA regulated the malignant phenotypes of PCa cells via the NF-κB signaling pathway mediated by GPBAR1.

For metastases that are not suitable for SBRT-regimens, a treatment with 30/40 Gy with simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) in 10 fractions represents a possible regimen. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of this concept and the acute and subacute toxicities.  Patients and methods:   Clinical records for dose-escalated radiotherapy of all consecutive patients treated with this regimen were evaluated retrospectively (24 patients with 28 target volumes for oncologic outcomes and 25 patients with 29 target volumes for treatment feasibility and dose parameters analysis). Analysis of radiotherapy plans included size of target volumes and dosimetric parameter for target volumes and organs at risk (OAR). Acute and subacute toxicities were evaluated according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0.  Results:   The most common localization was the spine (71.4%). The most common histology was prostate cancer (45.8%). Oligometastatic or oligoprogressive disease was the indication for dose-escalated radiotherapy in 19/24 patients (79.2%). Treatment was feasible with all patients completing radiotherapy. Acute toxicity grade 1 was documented in 36.0% of the patients. During follow up, one patient underwent surgery due to bone instability. The 1-year local control and patient-related progression-free survival (PFS) were 90.0 ± 6.7% and 33.3 ± 11.6%, respectively.

Of these, GS yields the largest effect on prostate cancer specific mortality. It was previously determined that those with cores with a mix of higher and lower GS at biopsy (which was termed a ""ComboGS"") had decreased risk for prostate cancer specific mortality after either surgical or radiation treatment. We validate the effect of ComboGS in an independent cohort of patients with prostate cancer treated with definitive dose-escalated radiation therapy (DE-RT) at 2 institutions.  Methods and materials:   DE-RT was administered to 2539 men, of which 687 men had a ComboGS. To further ascertain the ComboGS effect we employed the modified Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (mCAPRA) score. Rates of biochemical event-free survival and distant metastasis-free survival were compared across CAPRA scores, with and without modification, and the prognostic value of the CAPRA scores was compared using Harrel's concordance index.  Results:   On univariate analysis in Gleason 7 to 10 patients the presence of ComboGS improved 10-year biochemical event-free survival from 76.6% to 82.4% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.96; P = .021), 10-year distant metastasis-free survival from 89.3% to 93.2% (HR, 0.57; CI, 0.39-0.85; P = .005), 10-year prostate cancer specific survival from 93.9% to 97.4% (HR, 0.39; CI, 0.21-0.7; P = .001), and 10-year overall survival from 65.7% to 75.6% (HR, 0.69; CI, 0.57-0.83; P < .001). Multivariable analysis also supported that ComboGS is protective for biochemical failure (HR, 0.64; CI, 0.50-0.83; P < .001), distant metastasis (HR, 0.42; CI, 0.28-0.63; P < .001), death from prostate cancer (HR, 0.32; CI, 0.17-0.58; P < .001), and overall mortality (HR, 0.65; CI, 0.54-0.79; P < .001). Additionally, adjusting the mCAPRA score for ComboGS decreased the risk of biochemical failure by nearly 30% (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.88; P = .003) and by 50% (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.37-0.80; P = .002) for distant metastasis.  Conclusions:   ComboGS is a useful and readily available independent prognostic factor for all clinical endpoints evaluated.

We aimed to examine the association between the duration of ADT and bRFS in HR localized prostate cancer, based on nPSA.  Methods:   Between 1998 and 2015, 204 patients with HR localized prostate cancer were identified. Of them, 157 patients (77.0%) reached the desired nPSA of < 0.06 ng/mL (favorable group), while 47 (23.0%) did not (unfavorable group). Duration of ADT varied among patients depending on physician preference, patient tolerance, and/or compliance. Survival outcomes were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods and predictors of outcomes using multi-variable cox regression model.  Results:   In the favorable group, ADT for at least 12 months lead to superior bRFS compared to ≤ 9 months of ADT (P = 0.036). However, no significant difference was seen when examining the value of receiving ADT beyond 12, 18, or 24 months, respectively. On univariate analysis for bRFS, the use of ADT for at least 12 months was significant (P = 0.012) as well as time to nadir PSA (tnPSA), (≤ 6 vs > 6 months); (P = 0.043). The presenting T stage was borderline significant (HR 3.074; 95% CI 0.972-9.719; P = 0.056), while PSA at presentation, Gleason Score and age were not. On multivariate analysis, the use of ADT for 12 months (P = 0.012) and tnPSA (P = 0.037) remained significant.

Methods:   Using a cohort database from a Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study, we evaluated 26 738 participants (16 351 men and 10 387 women), who responded to a questionnaire about working hours and followed these participants from 1993-1994 to 2013. Participants were divided into four groups according to working hours (≤6, 7-8, 9-10, ≥11 h/day). The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of each cancer incidence were calculated using a multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   During 488 383 person-years of follow-up, 481 patients with newly diagnosed cancers were identified. There was no clear association between long working hours and overall cancer, lung cancer, and stomach cancer risks. Long working hours tended to increase prostate cancer risk in men and breast cancer risk in women, although the difference was not statistically significant. Increased liver cancer risk with short working hours (HR [95% CI]; 3.15 [1.44-6.88] in the ≤6 h/day group vs. 7-8 h/day) was observed. Colorectal cancer also tended to increase risk in short working hours, however, there were not statistically significance.  Conclusions:   In this population, long working hours were not associated with cancer risk with statistically significance. The association between short working hours and liver cancer risk was observed, probably due to the reverse causation of liver cancer.""","""['Kana Hattori', 'Tomotaka Sobue', 'Ling Zha', 'Tetsuhisa Kitamura', 'Yoshimitsu Shimomura', 'Motoki Iwasaki', 'Manami Inoue', 'Taiki Yamaji', 'Shoichiro Tsugane', 'Norie Sawada']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Occup Health""","""['Occupational sitting time and subsequent risk of cancer: The Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study.', 'Influence of coffee drinking on subsequent risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: a prospective study in Japan.', 'Working Hours and Risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction and Stroke Among Middle-Aged Japanese Men\u3000- The Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study Cohort II.', 'Diabetes mellitus and the risk of cancer: results from a large-scale population-based cohort study in Japan.', 'Association Between Alcohol Consumption and Risk of Pancreatic Cancer: The Japan Public Health Center-Based Prospective Study.']"""

The focus of this study was to apply robust EV isolation and subsequent data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) for urinary EV proteomics of prostate cancer and prostate inflammation patients. Urinary EVs were isolated by functionalized magnetic beads through chemical affinity on an automatic station, and EV proteins were analyzed by integrating three library-base analyses (Direct-DIA, GPF-DIA, and Fractionated DDA-base DIA) to improve the coverage and quantitation. We assessed the levels of urinary EV-associated proteins based on 40 samples consisting of 20 cases and 20 controls, where 18 EV proteins were identified to be differentiated in prostate cancer outcome, of which three (i.e., SERPINA3, LRG1, and SCGB3A1) were shown to be consistently upregulated. We also observed 6 out of the 18 (33%) EV proteins that had been developed as drug targets, while some of them showed protein-protein interactions. Moreover, the potential mechanistic pathways of 18 significantly different EV proteins were enriched in metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activities. These results showed consistency in an independent cohort with 20 participants. Using a random forest algorithm for classification assessment, including the identified EV proteins, we found that SERPINA3, LRG1, or SCGB3A1 add predictable value in addition to age, prostate size, body mass index (BMI), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

Current therapy options are effective in treating most prostate cancer patients, but a significant number of patients progress beyond a manageable disease. For these patients, immunotherapy has emerged as a real option in the treatment of the late-stage metastatic disease. Unfortunately, even the most successful immunotherapy strategies have only led to a four-month increase in survival. One issue responsible for the shortcomings in cancer immunotherapy is the inability to stimulate helper CD4+ T cells via the HLA class II pathway to generate a potent antitumor response. Obstacles to proper HLA class II stimulation in prostate cancer vaccine design include the lack of detectable class II proteins in prostate tumors and the absence of defined class II specific prostate tumor antigens. Here, for the first time, we show that the insertion of a lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) into prostate cancer cells directly enhances HLA class II antigen processing and results in increased CD4+ T cell activation by prostate cancer cells. We also show that GILT insertion does not alter the expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), an important target in prostate cancer vaccine strategies. Our study suggests that GILT expression enhances the presentation of the immunodominant PSMA459 epitope via the HLA class II pathway. Biochemical analysis showed that the PSMA459 peptide was cysteinylated under a normal physiologic concentration of cystine, and this cysteinylated form of PSMA459 inhibited T cell activation. Taken together, these results suggest that GILT has the potential to increase HLA class II Ag presentation and CD4+ T cell recognition of prostate cancer cells, and GILT-expressing prostate cancer cells could be used in designing cell therapy and/or vaccines against prostate cancer.""","""['Bently P Doonan', 'Shereen Amria', 'Jennifer R Bethard', 'Narendra L Banik', 'Jessica D Hathaway-Schrader', 'Azizul Haque']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Gamma-IFN-inducible-lysosomal thiol reductase modulates acidic proteases and HLA class II antigen processing in melanoma.', 'Prostate Cancer Immunotherapy: Exploiting the HLA Class II Pathway in Vaccine Design.', 'Identification of MHC class II-restricted T-cell epitopes in prostate-specific membrane antigen.', 'Diverse cellular and organismal functions of the lysosomal thiol reductase GILT.', 'CD4+ T-cell activation for immunotherapy of malignancies using Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrid vaccines.']"""

Here, we report retrospectively collected data from intensively pretreated AVPC patients (n = 17; 88.2% visceral metastases; 82% elevation of neuroendocrine markers) treated with salvage chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and paclitaxel (TIP). At the interim analysis, 60% of patients showed radiographic response or stable disease (PFS = 2.5 months; OS = 6 months). In men who responded to chemotherapy, an OS > 15 months was observed. Preclinical analyses confirmed the high activity of the TIP regimen, especially in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells. This effect was primarily mediated by increased cisplatin sensitivity in the emergence of taxane resistance. Proteomic and functional analyses identified a lower DNA repair capacity and cell cycle machinery deficiency to be causative. In contrast, paclitaxel showed inconsistent effects, partially antagonizing cisplatin and ifosfamide in some AVPC models. Consequently, paclitaxel has been excluded from the TIP combination for future patients. In summary, we report for the first time the promising efficacy of TIP as salvage therapy in AVPC.

Cell viability, migration ability, death receptors (DRs), and integrins (α3, β1) gene expression were evaluated, as well as human annexin V quantification and Akt phosphorylation. Differences among cells group, defined according to the treatment used, were assessed with ANOVA. The results showed that the effects of CU and LF are different between the two prostatic cell lines analyzed. In DU145, a reduction in cell proliferation and migration is reported both in the presence of single and combined treatments. In PC3 cells, there is a significant reduction in proliferation in the presence of CU alone, while the inhibition of migration is mainly related to the LF treatment and its combination with CU, compared to untreated cells.

Methods: Data from 219 consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsy (PBx) for suspicion of PCa, between January 2020 and June 2022, at our institution were retrospectively evaluated. Only patients who had mpMRI performed before PBx were included. The distribution of demographics and clinical features among PPAT-ADC values up to vs. above the median was studied using both parametric and non-parametric tests, according to variables. Linear and logistic regression models tested the association between PPAT-ADC values and determinants of PCa aggressiveness and the presence of intermediate-high risk PCa, respectively. Results: Of 132 included patients, 76 (58%) had PCa. Median PPAT-ADC was 876 (interquartile range: 654 − 1112) × 10−6 mm2/s. Patients with PPAT-ADC up to the median had a higher rate of PIRADS (Prostate Imaging—Reporting and Data System) 5 lesions (41% vs. 23%, p = 0.032), a higher percentage of PBx positive cores (25% vs. 6%, p = 0.049) and more frequently harbored ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) > 1 PCa (50% vs. 28%, p = 0.048). At univariable linear regression analyses, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, PIRADS 5, and percentage of PBx positive cores were associated with lower PPAT-ADC values. PPAT-ADC up to the median was an independent predictor for intermediate-high risk PCa (odds ratio: 3.24, 95%CI: 1.17−9.46, p = 0.026) after adjustment for age and body mass index. Conclusions: Lower PPAT-ADC values may be associated with higher biopsy ISUP grade group PCa and a higher percentage of PBx-positive cores.

If the cancer is organ-confined it can be treated by various ablative therapies such as RP (radical prostatectomy), RT (radiation therapy), brachytherapy, cryosurgery or HIFU (High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound). However, advanced or metastatic PCa treatment requires systemic therapy involving androgen deprivation, but such patients typically progress to refractory disease designated as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been established as a driver of prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression while less is known about the role of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family in prostate cancer. Moreover, MAPK/ERK, AKT/PI3K and Jak/STAT pathways that regulate proliferative, invasive and glucose-uptake processes in cancer progression are triggered by CNTF.  Methods:   We investigate CNTF and its receptor CNTFRα expressions in human androgen-responsive and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, we investigated the role of CNTF in proliferative, invasive processes as well as glucose uptake using two cell models mimicking the PCa (LNCaP cell line) and CRPC (22Rv1 cell line).

An inspection of the public database TSVdb showed that ISO1 was upregulated in lung, bladder, prostate, and breast cancer, ISO2 in all the cancers analysed (including rectum, colon, cervical, bladder, prostate, breast, head, and neck), ISO3 did not show significant changes between cancer and normal tissue. We overexpressed ISO1, ISO2, and ISO3 in SW620 cells and found that the ISO1 isoform was exclusively mitochondrial, ISO2 was present in the organelle and in the cytoplasm, and ISO3 was exclusively cytoplasmatic. The overexpression of ISO1 and, at a letter extent, of ISO2 enhanced basal, ATP-linked, and maximal respiration without altering the mitochondria number or network, mtDNA amount. or mitochondrial dynamics. A higher extracellular acidification rate was observed in ISO1 and ISO2, overexpressing cells, suggesting an increase in glycolysis. Cells overexpressing the different isoforms did not show a difference in the proliferation rate but showed a great increase in anchorage-independent growth. ISO1 and ISO2, but not ISO3, determined an upregulation of EMT-related proteins, which appeared unrelated to higher mitochondrial ROS production, nor due to the activation of the MEK ERK pathway, but rather to global metabolic reprogramming of cells.""","""['Giada Zanini', 'Valentina Selleri', 'Anna De Gaetano', 'Lara Gibellini', 'Mara Malerba', 'Anna Vittoria Mattioli', 'Milena Nasi', 'Nadezda Apostolova', 'Marcello Pinti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Distinct regulation of mitochondrial localization and stability of two human Sirt5 isoforms.', 'ATP-Dependent Lon Protease Contributes to Helicobacter pylori-Induced Gastric Carcinogenesis.', 'The biology of Lonp1: More than a mitochondrial protease.', 'Inhibition of Lonp1 induces mitochondrial remodeling and autophagy suppression in cervical cancer cells.', 'Cell stress management by the mitochondrial LonP1 protease - Insights into mitigating developmental, oncogenic and cardiac stress.', 'Mitochondria Deregulations in Cancer Offer Several Potential Targets of Therapeutic Interventions.', 'The Role of Lonp1 on Mitochondrial Functions during Cardiovascular and Muscular Diseases.']"""

The success provides an opportunity of applying PARP inhibitor therapy to treat other cancer types with BRCAness features. However, systematic knowledge is lack for BRCAness in different cancer types beyond breast and ovarian cancer. We performed a comprehensive characterization for 40 BRCAness-related genes in 33 cancer types with over 10,000 cancer cases, including pathogenic variation, homozygotic deletion, promoter hypermethylation, gene expression, and clinical correlation of BRCAness in each cancer type. Using BRCA1/BRCA2 mutated breast and ovarian cancer as the control, we observed that BRCAness is widely present in multiple cancer types. Based on the sum of the BRCAneass features in each cancer type, we identified the following 21 cancer types as the potential targets for PARPi therapy: adrenocortical carcinoma, bladder urothelial carcinoma, brain lower grade glioma, colon adenocarcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, head and neck squamous carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, mesothelioma, rectum adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, skin cutaneous melanoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, uterine carcinosarcoma, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.""","""['Maoni Guo', 'San Ming Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['The clinical importance of BRCAness in a population-based cohort of Danish epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Integrative omics analysis reveals relationships of genes with synthetic lethal interactions through a pan-cancer analysis.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'The emerging role of homologous recombination repair and PARP inhibitors in genitourinary malignancies.', 'Use of poly ADP-ribose polymerase PARP inhibitors in cancer cells bearing DDR defects: the rationale for their inclusion in the clinic.', 'Evolutionary Origin of Human PALB2 Germline Pathogenic Variants.', 'EMSY stabilization in KEAP1-mutant lung cancer disrupts genome stability and type I interferon signaling.']"""

However, the exact molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, single-cell transcriptomics of bone marrow (BM) macrophages undergoing efferocytosis of apoptotic prostate cancer cells revealed a significant enrichment in their cellular response to hypoxia. Here, we show that BM macrophage efferocytosis increased hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1α) and STAT3 phosphorylation (p-STAT3 at Tyr705) under normoxic conditions, while inhibitors of p-STAT3 reduced HIF-1α. Efferocytosis promoted HIF-1α stabilization, reduced its ubiquitination, and induced HIF-1α and p-STAT3 nuclear translocation. HIF-1α stabilization in efferocytic BM macrophages resulted in enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine MIF, whereas BM macrophages with inactive HIF-1α reduced MIF expression upon efferocytosis. Stabilization of HIF-1α using the HIF-prolyl-hydroxylase inhibitor, Roxadustat, enhanced MIF expression in BM macrophages. Furthermore, BM macrophages treated with recombinant MIF protein activated NF-κB (p65) signaling and increased the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Altogether, these findings suggest that the clearance of apoptotic cancer cells by BM macrophages triggers p-STAT3/HIF-1α/MIF signaling to promote further inflammation in the bone tumor microenvironment where a significant number of apoptotic cancer cells are present.""","""['Veronica Mendoza-Reinoso', 'Patricia M Schnepp', 'Dah Youn Baek', 'John R Rubin', 'Ernestina Schipani', 'Evan T Keller', 'Laurie K McCauley', 'Hernan Roca']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Unique Pro-Inflammatory Response of Macrophages during Apoptotic Cancer Cell Clearance.', 'PM2.5 induce the defective efferocytosis and promote atherosclerosis via HIF-1α activation in macrophage.', 'Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells induced by inflammatory cytokines produce angiogenetic factors and promote prostate cancer growth.', 'Metabolic evolutionary roots of the macrophage immune response in amoeba-bacteria interactions: The conserved role of hypoxia-induced Factor and AMP kinase.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.']"""

In these, the tissue architecture is preserved and thus provides information on the spatial distribution and localization of protein expression at the cellular and extracellular levels. The database is freely available online through the HPA website but currently without support for large-scale screening and analysis of the images in the database. Features like spatial information are typically lacking in gene expression datasets from homogenized tissues or single-cell analysis. To enable high throughput analysis of the HPA database, we developed the AtlasGrabber software. It is available freely under an open-source license. Based on a predefined gene list, the software fetches the images from the database and displays them for the user. Several filters for specific antibodies or images enable the user to customize her/his image analysis. Up to four images can be displayed simultaneously, which allows for the comparison of protein expression between different tissues and between normal and cancerous tissues. An additional feature is the XML parser that allows the extraction of a list of available antibodies, images, and genes for specific tissues or cancer types from the HPA's database file.  Results:   Compared to existing software designed for a similar purpose, ours provide more functionality and is easier to use. To demonstrate the software's usability, we identified six new markers of basal cells of the prostate. A comparison to prostate cancer showed that five of them are absent in prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   The HPA is a uniquely valuable database. By facilitating its usefulness with the AtlasGrabber, we enable researchers to exploit its full capacity. The loss of basal cell markers is diagnostic for prostate cancer and can help refine the histopathological diagnosis of prostate cancer. As proof of concept, with the AtlasGrabber we identified five new potential biomarkers specific for prostate basal cells which are lost in prostate cancer and thus can be used for prostate cancer diagnostics.""","""['Benedek Bozoky', 'Laszlo Szekely', 'Ingemar Ernberg', 'Andrii Savchenko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Prioritization of cancer marker candidates based on the immunohistochemistry staining images deposited in the human protein atlas.', 'The urologic epithelial stem cell database (UESC) - a web tool for cell type-specific gene expression and immunohistochemistry images of the prostate and bladder.', 'Production of tissue microarrays, immunohistochemistry staining and digitalization within the human protein atlas.', 'Manual evaluation of tissue microarrays in a high-throughput research project: The contribution of Indian surgical pathology to the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project.', 'The Stanford Tissue Microarray Database.', 'Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Tissue Biomarker Analysis: A Comparison of Human Protein Atlas and Individual Testicular Germ Cell Tumor Component Immunohistochemistry.']"""

However, limited global evaluation of psychosocial challenges experienced after treatment exists. Therefore, we aimed to explore the lived experiences of men who underwent radical treatment, and its psychosocial impact.  Material and methods:   This qualitative study was conducted using 19 men who had undergone radical treatment (prostatectomy or radiotherapy) for their cancer. Semi-structured interviews were conducted exploring lived experiences of men after treatment. A Structured thematic analysis of collected data was undertaken, with an inductive co-construction of themes through the lens of the biopsychosocial model. Themes generated were considered within a psychological, social, and physical wellbeing framework.  Results:   An initial knowledge gap meant mental wellbeing was strongly impacted initially leading to a 'Diagnostic Blow and the Search for Clarity'. Doubt over individuals' future resulted in 'An Uncertain Future' in many men. Once treatment was completed a 'Reflective journey' began, with men considering their outcomes and decisions made. Social wellbeing was also impacted with many identifying the 'Emotional Repercussions' on their relationships and the impact their diagnosis had on their partner and family. Many subsequently sought to increase their support through 'The Social Network and Advocacy', while physical changes led to an increased need for 'Social Planning'. Finally, physical wellbeing was highlighted by a continual acknowledgement of the 'Natural process of ageing' leading to a reluctancy to seek help, whilst simultaneously attempting to improve existing health via 'The Health Kick'.  Conclusions:   Radical treatments have a considerable impact on mental and social wellbeing of individuals. Anxiety after diagnosis and significant uncertainty over individual futures exist, with physical complications of treatment leading to social repercussions. Future research should aim to identify forms of support to improve quality of life of these men.""","""['Neel Vyas', 'Oliver Brunckhorst', 'Louis Fox', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Gordon Muir', 'Robert Stewart', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Kamran Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['An exploration of wellbeing in men diagnosed with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance: a qualitative study.', 'Symptom experiences of older adults during treatment for metastatic prostate cancer: A qualitative investigation.', 'Perceptions of wellbeing and quality of life following participation in a community-based pre-operative exercise programme in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer: A qualitative pilot study.', 'Sexual minority men and the experience of undergoing treatment for prostate cancer: An integrative review.', 'Psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Fear of Cancer Recurrence and Coping Strategies among Prostate Cancer Survivors: A Qualitative Study.']"""

The development of digital PET/CT has greatly improved smaller lesion detection. This study's goal was to compare the performance and clinical value of PSMA-targeted piflufolastat PET/CT for prostate cancer BCF with digital versus analog PET/CT.  Methods:   In this retrospective study, all piflufolastat PET/CT scans in subjects with PSA ≤ 3.0 ng/mL who were referred for prostate cancer BCF were included. The performance characteristics of 171 analog PET/CT studies in 155 subjects from May 2017 to January 2020 and 106 digital PET/CT studies in 103 subjects from February 2020 to December 2020 were compared. Lesions were considered malignant if they did not match the known physiological distribution of piflufolastat and did not represent uptake in benign lesions. PSMA PET/CT studies were considered positive if at least one malignant lesion was detected and negative if none were detected.  Results:   Digital piflufolastat PET/CT outperformed analog piflufolastat PET/CT in subjects with PSA < 0.5 ng/mL with a positivity rate of 69% versus 37%, respectively. In patients with PSA ≥ 0.5 ng/mL, both technologies performed similarly. There was no statistically significant difference between the number or size of piflufolastat-avid lesions detected per PET/CT study.

Direct studies in Prostate cancer (PC) of intratumoral immune heterogeneity characterized by immune cell subtype, are still lacking. Using the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) algorithm, the abundance of 28 immune cells infiltration (ICI) were determined for PC. A NMF was performed to determine tumour-sample clustering based on the abundance of ICI and PFS information. Hub genes of clusters were identified via weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). The multivariate dimensionality reduction analysis of hub genes expression matrix was carried out via principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain immune score (IS). We analysed the correlation between clustering, IS and clinical phenotype. We divided the 495 patients into clusterA (n = 193) and clusterB (n = 302) on the basis of ICI and PFS via NMF. The progression-free survival (PFS) were better for clusterA than for clusterB (p < 0.001). Each immune cell subtypes was more abundant in clusterA than in clusterB (p < 0.001). The expression levels of CTAL-4 and PD-L1 were lower in clusterB than in clusterA (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006). We obtained 103 hub genes via WGCNA. In the training and validation cohorts, the prognosis of high IS group was worse than that of the low IS group (p < 0.05). IS had good predictive effect on 5-year PFS. The expression of immune checkpoint genes was higher in the low IS group than in the high IS group (p < 0.01). Patients with low IS and receiving hormone therapy had better prognosis than other groups. The combination of IS and clinical characteristics including lymph node metastasis and gleason score can better differentiate patient outcomes than using it alone. IS was a practical algorithm to predict the prognosis of patients. Advanced PC patients with low IS may be more sensitive to hormone therapy.

The goal of this study was to provide causal estimates of the connection between sex hormone-binding globulin and prostate cancer and investigate the possible mediating function of other modifiable risk indicators.  Methods:   We used two-step, two-sample multivariable Mendelian randomization using single-nucleotide polymorphisms as instrumental variables for exposure and mediators. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with sex hormone-binding globulin and bioavailable testosterone were screened via a genome-wide association study enrolling European-descent adult male individuals. Summary-level data for prostate cancer (79,148 cases and 61,106 controls) were extracted from the PRACTICAL consortium. The total effect of sex hormone-binding globulin on prostate cancer risk was decomposed into direct and indirect effects through the mediator, bioavailable testosterone. An inverse-variance-weighted method was the primary Mendelian randomization analysis method. Sensitivity analyses were performed via Mendelian randomization-Egger regression, heterogeneity test, pleiotropy test, and leave-one-out test. The directionality that exposure causes the outcome was verified using Mendelian randomization-Steiger test.  Results:   In the univariable Mendelian randomization analysis, genetically predicted higher sex hormone-binding globulin levels had a causal association with lower prostate cancer risk (odds ratio = 0.944, 95% confidence interval = 0.897-0.993, p = 0.027) and an inverse association with bioavailable testosterone level (odds ratio = 0.945, 95% confidence interval = 0.926-0.965, p = 1.62E-07) without controlling for other factors. Moreover, an increase of one standard deviation (59.5 pmol/L) in genetically predicted bioavailable testosterone level was significantly associated with a 22.0% increase in the overall prostate cancer risk (odds ratio = 1.220, 95% confidence interval = 1.064-1.398, p = 0.004) after adjusting for sex hormone-binding globulin level. The effect size ratio of bioavailable testosterone-mediated sex hormone-binding globulin to prostate cancer was further analyzed to clarify the importance of the mediating effect. Notably, the mediator bioavailable testosterone explained 19.28% (95% confidence interval = 10.76%, 73.78%) of the total effect of sex hormone-binding globulin level on prostate cancer risk.  Conclusion:   The results support the potentially protective causal effect of genetically predicted higher sex hormone-binding globulin levels against prostate cancer with mediation by the modifiable risk factor, bioavailable testosterone. More research is needed to determine how this possible sex hormone-binding globulin-bioavailable testosterone-prostate cancer link works.

However, aberrations in MMR genes were rare in PCa and there is evidence that MMR genes mutations are highly ethnic specific. Thus, the prevalence and clinical characteristics of this subgroup in Chinese PCa patients are largely unknown. Furthermore, why some of these patients do not respond to ICB also remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the sequencing data from 3338 Chinese PCa patients to profile the mutation spectrum of the MMR genes. We found that in metastatic disease, the pathogenic mutation frequency of MMR genes in Chinese PCa patients was higher than that in the Caucasus population (4.8 vs 2.2%, P = 0.006) and the mutation carriers responded poorer to androgen deprive therapy (ADT) and abiraterone than non-carriers. Besides, we reported a multi-institutional cases series of 11 PCa patients with mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) who received programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitors, and performed multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIF) to explore the relationship between tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and response to ICB. The results showed that the responders had higher density of intratumoral CD8+ T cells than non-responders. Our data suggested MMR genes mutations may be more common in Chinese PCa patients, and it is associated with poorer response to hormonal therapies. We propose that the density of intratumoral CD8+ T cells could be a promising predictor to help further subdivide the population of PCa patients who can benefit from immunotherapy.""","""['Bangwei Fang#', 'Yu Wei#', 'Hao Zeng#', 'Yonghong Li#', 'Shouzhen Chen#', 'Tingwei Zhang', 'Jian Pan', 'Beihe Wang', 'Junlong Wu', 'Shengming Jin', 'Hualei Gan', 'Mengna Hu', 'Ding Zhang', 'Dingwei Ye', 'Yao Zhu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Analysis of the Prevalence of Microsatellite Instability in Prostate Cancer and Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade.', 'BRD4 inhibition impairs DNA mismatch repair, induces mismatch repair mutation signatures and creates therapeutic vulnerability to immune checkpoint blockade in MMR-proficient tumors.', 'A Comprehensive Biomarker Analysis of Microsatellite Unstable/Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer Cohort Treated with Immunotherapy.', 'Deficient mismatch repair/microsatellite unstable colorectal cancer: Diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.', 'Why is immunotherapy effective (or not) in patients with MSI/MMRD tumors?', 'Real-world efficacy and prognostic factors of lenvatinib plus PD-1 inhibitors in 378 unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma patients.', 'Treatment options for unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma with hepatitis virus infection following sorafenib failure.']"""

It can be assumed that GnRH need to be used with greater caution in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study investigated association of GnRH with atherogenic lipids (AL) in PCa men with T2DM.  Methods:   Two cohorts including 38,311 men with 11 years follow-up based on Swedish national registers were defined (PCa-Exposure cohort and GnRH-Exposure cohort). Based on European guidelines on cardiovascular diseases (CVD), primary outcomes were defined as: 1.0 mmol/L increase in AL and lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) intensification. We used Cox proportional-hazards models and Kaplan-Meier curves to assess the association.  Results:   There was an association between GnRH and increased AL (i.e., triglyceride, PCa-Exposure cohort: HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.48-2.10; GnRH-Exposure cohort: HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.38-2.57).

With conformal prediction, 1 in 794 (0.1%) predictions is incorrect for cancer diagnosis (compared to 14 errors [2%] without conformal prediction) while 175 (22%) of the predictions are flagged as unreliable when the AI-system is presented with new data from the same lab and scanner that it was trained on. Conformal prediction could with small samples (N = 49 for external scanner, N = 10 for external lab and scanner, and N = 12 for external lab, scanner and pathology assessment) detect systematic differences in external data leading to worse predictive performance. The AI-system with conformal prediction commits 3 (2%) errors for cancer detection in cases of atypical prostate tissue compared to 44 (25%) without conformal prediction, while the system flags 143 (80%) unreliable predictions.

Consequently, it is difficult to assess the implementation of scientific advances and adherence to best practices in routine clinical practice. To address this need, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Radiation Oncology Program established the VA Radiation Oncology Quality Surveillance (VA ROQS) Program to develop clinical quality measures to assess the quality of RO care delivered to Veterans with cancer. This article reports the prostate cancer consensus measures.  Methods and materials:   The VA ROQS Program contracted with the American Society for Radiation Oncology to commission a Blue Ribbon Panel of prostate cancer experts to develop a set of evidence-based measures and performance expectations. From February to June 2021, the panel developed quality, aspirational, and surveillance measures for (1) initial consultation and workup, (2) simulation, treatment planning, and delivery, and (3) follow-up. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) constraints to be used as quality measures for definitive and post-prostatectomy radiation therapy were selected. The panel also identified the optimal Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE V5.0), toxicity terms to assess in follow-up.  Results:   Eighteen prostate-specific measures were developed (13 quality, 2 aspirational, and 3 surveillance). DVH metrics tailored to conventional, moderately hypofractionated, and ultrahypofractionated regimens were identified. Decision trees to determine performance for each measure were developed. Eighteen CTCAE V5.0 terms were selected in the sexual, urinary, and gastrointestinal domains as highest priority for assessment during follow-up.  Conclusions:   This set of measures and DVH constraints serves as a tool for assessing the comprehensive quality of RO care for prostate cancer. These measures will be used for ongoing quality surveillance and improvement among veterans receiving care across VA and community sites. These measures can also be applied to clinical settings outside of those serving veterans.""","""['Abhishek A Solanki', 'Lindsay L Puckett', 'Ksenija Kujundzic', 'Evangelia Katsoulakis', 'John Park', 'Rishabh Kapoor', 'Michael Hagan', 'Maria Kelly', 'Jatinder Palta', 'Leslie K Ballas', 'John DeMarco', 'Karen E Hoffman', 'Colleen A F Lawton', 'Jeff Michalski', 'Louis Potters', 'Michael Zelefsky', 'Randi Kudner', 'Samantha Dawes', 'Emily Wilson', 'Howard Sandler']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Consensus Quality Measures and Dose Constraints for Breast Cancer From the Veterans Affairs Radiation Oncology Quality Surveillance Program and American Society for Radiation Oncology Expert Panel.', 'Consensus Quality Measures and Dose Constraints for Rectal Cancer From the Veterans Affairs Radiation Oncology Quality Surveillance Program and American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Expert Panel.', 'Consensus Quality Measures and Dose Constraints for Lung Cancer From the Veterans Affairs Radiation Oncology Quality Surveillance Program and ASTRO Expert Panel.', 'Consensus Quality Measures and Dose Constraints for Head and Neck Cancer with an emphasis on Oropharyngeal and Laryngeal Cancer from the Veterans Affairs Radiation Oncology Quality Surveillance Program and American Society for Radiation Oncology Expert Panel.', 'Consensus statements on radiation therapy of prostate cancer: guidelines for prostate re-biopsy after radiation and for radiation therapy with rising prostate-specific antigen levels after radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   This was a multicenter registry genome-wide expression profiling study of prospectively collected radical prostatectomy (RP) tumor samples from 2014 to 2016. DDR activity was calculated from average expression of 372 DDR genes. Consensus hierarchical clustering was used to arrive at a robust clustering solution based on DDR gene expression patterns. Genome-wide differential expression between clusters was performed, and outcomes were evaluated across expression patterns.  Results:   Of 5239 patients from the prospective registry, 376 had favorable-risk disease (Grade group [GG] 1 to 2, PSA prior to RP <10ng/ml, pT2 or less). DDR activity score was correlated with prognostic genomic signatures that predict for metastatic risk (r = 0.37, P < 2e-16) and high grade groups (P < .001). High DDR activity (top-quartile) was observed in 28% of patients with favorable-risk disease. In favorable-risk disease, 3 distinct clusters with varied DDR activity emerged with consensus clustering. Cluster I (compared with cluster II-III and GG3-GG5 disease) had the highest expression of all DDR sub-pathways, MYC, PAPR1, AR, and AR activity (P < .001 for all). Furthermore, cluster I was associated with poorer metastasis-free survival (MFS) and Overall survival (OS) compared with other clusters (MFS; HR: 2.43, 95%CI, [1.22-4.83], P = .01; OS; HR: 2.77, 95%CI, [1.18-6.5], P = .01).

Results and limitations:   In total, 666 men with a median age of 67 yr (interquartile range [IQR]: 61-71) and PSA of 3.4 ng/ml (2.5-5.0) were included, of whom 154 (23%) had csPC. Risk distribution of the RPCRC was narrow: median risks of 2% (IQR 1-4%) compared with 14% (IQR: 9.5-23%) for Stockholm3. Using RPCRC's recommended risk threshold of ≥4% for finding csPC, 54% of all csPC cases would be detected versus 94% using Stockholm3 with a threshold of ≥11%. Calibration of Stockholm3 was adequate while RPCRC underestimated the risk of csPC. The Stockholm3 test showed positive net benefits at clinically relevant thresholds, while the RPCRC showed negative net benefits. Compared with PSA, the RPCRC was associated with lower detection of csPC (84 vs 103; 0.82 [0.71-0.93]), while Stockholm3 was associated with higher detection of csPC (143 vs 103; 1.40 [1.23-1.57]). The main limitation was that Stockholm3 was evaluated in a similar population to where it was developed.  Conclusions:   The performance of the RPCRC in a Swedish population-based cohort is suboptimal with a considerable underestimation of prostate cancer risk, while the Stockholm3 test showed superior performance and a positive clinical benefit.  Patient summary:   The use of the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator available online to predict the risk of prostate cancer in a Swedish cohort was found to be clinically harmful as it underpredicted the risk of clinically significant prostate cancer, while the Stockholm3 test performed well showing clinical benefits.""","""['Thorgerdur Palsdottir', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Arnaldur Hilmisson', 'Martin Eklund', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Hari T Vigneswaran']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['External Validation of the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group Risk Calculator and the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in a Swedish Population-based Screening Cohort.', 'Prostate cancer screening using a combination of risk-prediction, MRI, and targeted prostate biopsies (STHLM3-MRI): a prospective, population-based, randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial.', 'A Head-to-head Comparison of Prostate Cancer Diagnostic Strategies Using the Stockholm3 Test, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Swedish National Guidelines: Results from a Prospective Population-based Screening Study.', 'Identifying Prostate Cancer Among Men with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

A VISION-like, Single-Center Analysis""","""18F-FDG and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET have been used to assess eligibility for PSMA-targeted therapy by some centers. However, it remains unclear whether both examinations are needed as a part of workup in the clinical practice or whether PSMA PET alone, as was done in the positive phase 3 VISION trial, is sufficient to identify suitable candidates. The aim was to reanalyze all patients who underwent both 18F-FDG and PSMA PET for PSMA-targeted therapy eligibility assessment using the VISION trial criteria. Methods: Eighty-nine men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer referred to 177Lu-PSMA therapy from June 2019 to October 2021 who underwent both 18F-FDG and PSMA PET (using either 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 18F-PSMA-1007) examinations within 2 wk were included in this analysis. Eligibility status was determined in accordance with either knowledge of both 18F-FDG and PSMA PET (clinical routine) or VISION criteria with PSMA PET-only (study reassessment, done twice with liver only for PSMA-11 and liver/spleen as reference for PSMA-1007). A metastasis seen on 18F-FDG PET or CT but not on PSMA PET was denoted as a mismatch finding and led to exclusion from 177Lu-PSMA therapy. On the basis of clinical assessment, 52 patients received 177Lu-PSMA therapy, and 37 did not; all patients were reassessed. Results: Patients treated with 177Lu-PSMA therapy had significantly longer overall survival than those not treated (12.4 vs. 6.8 mo, P < 0.01). PSMA-only analysis (spleen/liver reference) and 18F-FDG/PSMA mismatch reads had substantial agreement (Cohen κ = 0.73). Eighteen percent (n = 16/89) of patients had a mismatch finding based on 18F-FDG/PSMA PET. With the liver/spleen reference, a minor fraction of patients who had no mismatch finding (and were therefore treated) would have been withheld from therapy by PSMA-only analysis (3%). Three percent (n = 3) of all patients had an 18F-FDG/PSMA mismatch finding not detected by PSMA PET-only (VISION-like) analysis. For patients not receiving PSMA therapy, the overall survival was not statistically significantly different comparing 18F-FDG/PSMA mismatch versus nonmismatch (P = 0.61) patients. Conclusion: 18F-FDG and PSMA PET provide complementary information, yet less than 5% of patients had mismatch findings not detected using PSMA PET-only. Based on our data, 18F-FDG/PSMA mismatch examination and PSMA-only analysis have a substantial level of agreement.""","""['Robert Seifert', 'Tugce Telli', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Phillip H Kuo', 'Ken Herrmann']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['The Prognostic Value of Posttreatment 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and NOX66 in a Phase I/II Trial (LuPIN).', 'Results of a Prospective Phase 2 Pilot Trial of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Including Imaging Predictors of Treatment Response and Patterns of Progression.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', 'A Walk with Lu-177 PSMA: How Close we Have Reached from Bench to Bedside?']"""

However, the association between MC-LR and the risk and prognosis of prostate cancer has not been conducted in epidemiological studies. No reported studies have linked MC-LR exposure to the poor prognosis of prostate cancer by conducting experimental studies. The content of MC-LR was detected in most of the aquatic food in wet markets and supermarkets in Nanjing and posed a health risk for consumers. MC-LR levels in both prostate cancer tissues and serum were significantly higher than controls. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for prostate cancer risk by serum MC-LR was 1.75 (95%CI: 1.21-2.52) in the whole subjects, and a positive correlation between MC-LR and advanced tumor stage was observed. Survival curve analysis indicated patients with higher MC-LR levels in tissues exhibited poorer overall survival. Human, animal, and cell studies confirmed that MC-LR exposure increases the expression of estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in prostate cancer. Moreover, MC-LR-induced decreased E-cadherin levels, increased vimentin levels, and increased migratory and invasive capacities of prostate cancer cells were markedly suppressed upon ERα knockdown. MC-LR-induced xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis in BALB/c nude mice can be effectively alleviated with ERα knockdown. Our data demonstrated that MC-LR upregulated vimentin and downregulated E-cadherin through activating ERα, promoting migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.

Here, we developed a strategy for targeted photothermal therapy (PTT) using PSMA as the target. The results of molecular docking demonstrated that the synthesized PEG modified urea-based PSMA inhibitor (small molecular PSMA inhibitor, PI) PI-PEG has a high affinity energy (binding energy = - 8.3 kcal mol-1) for the PSMA target. Therefore, modification of PI-PEG onto the surface of gold@polydopamine (Au@PDA) with NIR-II absorption could enable targeted PTT against PSMA. This work revealed that the prepared Au@PDA/PEG-PI were not only highly selective for PSMA, but also could efficiently ablate PSMA expression by targeted PTT at the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) of the NIR-II laser. Moreover, Au@PDA/PEG-PI also have potential for photoacoustic (PA) imaging and computed tomography (CT) imaging. As the first strategy to downregulate the expression of PSMA and successfully inhibit prostate cancer by targeted PTT, this study case provides a new idea for the clinical translation of PSMA as an integrated target for tumor diagnosis and anti-tumor treatment.

This study aimed to determine the effects of perinatal BPA exposure on induction of prostate cancer in rats by sequential treatment with N-methyl-N-nitrosamine (MNU) and continuous low dose administration of testosterone. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to BPA administered by subcutaneous Alzet minipumps at doses of 2.5 or 25 µg/kg body weight/day from gestational day 9 until postnatal day 28 when pups were weaned providing exposure of offspring in utero and via the mother's milk. At 10-12 weeks of age, one male offspring per litter was treated with an intraperitoneal injection of MNU after hormonal stimulation of prostatic cell proliferation followed two weeks later by subcutaneous insertion of Silastic implants containing testosterone until the termination of the study 57-58 weeks after MNU injection. The perinatal BPA exposure did not significantly affect the incidence of prostate carcinomas which was slightly lower in exposed rats (33-23 %) than in control animals (40 %). Carcinomas in all accessory sex glands combined were also insignificantly less frequent in exposed (46-48 %) than in control rats (60 %). The incidence of malignant tumors at any site in the body was significantly lower in exposed rats (81-65 %) than in controls (93 %). In conclusion, perinatal BPA exposure did not significantly modify prostate cancer induction by MNU plus testosterone in rats, unlike the enhancement of prostate carcinogenesis induced by treatments involving estradiol administration.

Combining anti-PD-L1 with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein (CTLA) and chemotherapy may significantly improve efficacy.  Patients and methods:   MOVIE is a multicohort phase I/II study examining the combination of anti-PD-L1 durvalumab (Durv; 1500 mg IV Q4W) plus anti-CTLA tremelimumab (Trem; 75 mg IV Q4W) with metronomic vinorelbine (MVino; 20-40 mg orally daily) in various AST resistant to conventional therapies. The primary objective of the phase I part was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for phase II (RP2D).  Results:   Among the 14 patients enrolled during phase I, including 13 women and 1 man, 9 had BC, 1 PC, 2 CC, and 2 miscellaneous cancers with high mutational loads. Median age was 53 years. A total of 12 patients were assessable for the dose-escalation part in which only one dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was observed [one neutropenia without fever, grade (G) 4]. Two (14.3%), four (28.6%), and four (28.6%) patients had G ≥3 adverse events (AEs) related to MVino, Durv, and Trem, respectively. Treatment-related events included mostly clinical AEs with asthenia (eight G2; three G3), colitis (one G2, one G3), diarrhea (one G3), nausea (two G2), dry skin (two G2), maculopapular rash (one G3), and hyperthyroidism (three G2). No toxic death was reported. Preliminary data showed one patient (CC) who presented a complete response and four patients with stable disease (SD).  Conclusions:   MTD was not reached and dose level 2 (MVino 40 mg, Durv 1500 mg, Trem 75 mg) was selected as RP2D.

Objective:   To characterize the frequency, cost, and source of low-value prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing and subsequent care cascades among veterans dually enrolled in the VHA and Medicare and to determine whether receiving a PSA test through the VHA vs Medicare is associated with more downstream services.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used VHA and Medicare administrative data from fiscal years (FYs) 2017 to 2018. The study cohort consisted of male US veterans dually enrolled in the VHA and Medicare who were aged 75 years or older without a history of prostate cancer, elevated PSA, prostatectomy, radiation therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, or a urology visit. Data were analyzed from December 15, 2020, to October 20, 2022.  Exposures:   Receipt of low-value PSA testing.  Main outcomes and measures:   Differences in the use and cost of cascade services occurring 6 months after receipt of a low-value PSA test were assessed for veterans who underwent low-value PSA testing in the VHA and Medicare compared with those who did not, adjusted for patient- and facility-level covariates.  Results:   This study included 300 393 male US veterans at risk of undergoing low-value PSA testing. They had a mean (SD) age of 82.6 (5.6) years, and the majority (264 411 [88.0%]) were non-Hispanic White. Of these veterans, 36 459 (12.1%) received a low-value PSA test through the VHA, which was associated with 31.2 (95% CI, 29.2 to 33.2) additional cascade services per 100 veterans and an additional $24.5 (95% CI, $20.8 to $28.1) per veteran compared with the control group. In the same cohort, 17 981 veterans (5.9%) received a PSA test through Medicare, which was associated with 39.3 (95% CI, 37.2 to 41.3) additional cascade services per 100 veterans and an additional $35.9 (95% CI, $31.7 to $40.1) per veteran compared with the control group. When compared directly, veterans who received a PSA test through Medicare experienced 9.9 (95% CI, 9.7 to 10.1) additional cascade services per 100 veterans compared with those who underwent testing within the VHA.  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this cohort study suggest that US veterans dually enrolled in the VHA and Medicare commonly experienced low-value PSA testing and subsequent care cascades through both systems in FYs 2017 and 2018. Care cascades occurred more frequently through Medicare compared with the VHA. These findings suggest that low-value PSA testing has substantial downstream implications for patients and may be especially challenging to measure when care occurs in multiple health care systems.""","""['Aimee N Pickering', 'Xinhua Zhao', 'Florentina E Sileanu', 'Elijah Z Lovelace', 'Liam Rose', 'Aaron L Schwartz', 'Allison H Oakes', 'Jennifer A Hale', 'Loren J Schleiden', 'Walid F Gellad', 'Michael J Fine', 'Carolyn T Thorpe', 'Thomas R Radomski']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Prevalence and Cost of Care Cascades Following Low-Value Preoperative Electrocardiogram and Chest Radiograph Within the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Low-Value Prostate-Specific Antigen Test for Prostate Cancer Screening and Subsequent Health Care Utilization and Spending.', 'Low-Value Prostate Cancer Screening Among Older Men Within the Veterans Health Administration.', 'Evidence Brief: The Quality of Care Provided by Advanced Practice Nurses Internet.', 'Evidence Brief: Comparative Effectiveness of Appointment Recall Reminder Procedures for Follow-up Appointments Internet.', 'Behavioral Health Care Delivery Through Street Medicine Programs in California.', 'Veterans Health Administration (VA) vs. Non-VA Healthcare Quality: A Systematic Review.']"""

We compared PFS2 and medical costs between the two treatment groups. PFS2 was defined as the time from first-line therapy to progression on second-line therapy. Medical costs were estimated using the National Health Insurance drug prices in 2022 in Japan.  Results:   The upfront DOC and ABI groups included 107 and 233 patients, respectively. The incidence of metastatic castration-resistant PC progression was significantly higher in the upfront DOC group compared with the incidence in the upfront ABI group. However, no significant differences in PFS2 were observed between the two treatment groups. Monthly medical costs per patient were significantly higher in the upfront ABI group ($3453) compared with the costs in the upfront DOC group ($1239, P < 0.001). The cost differences were significantly influenced by differences in the length of androgen deprivation therapy monotherapy (DOC group, 13.4 months vs. ABI group, 0.0 months).  Conclusions:   We observed a significant cost benefit in the upfront DOC group in Japanese real-world practice, while the PFS2 rates were similar between the groups. Upfront DOC was a more cost-effective option for men with mHSPC who were eligible for toxic chemotherapy.""","""['Kai Ozaki', 'Shingo Hatakeyama', 'Shintaro Narita', 'Kenichi Hata', 'Takafumi Yanagisawa', 'Toshikazu Tanaka', 'Kyo Togashi', 'Tomoko Hamaya', 'Teppei Okamoto', 'Hayato Yamamoto', 'Takahiro Yoneyama', 'Yasuhiro Hashimoto', 'Takahiro Kimura', 'Tomonori Habuchi', 'Chikara Ohyama']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Docetaxel versus abiraterone for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with focus on efficacy of sequential therapy.', 'Real-world outcomes and risk stratification in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer treated with upfront abiraterone acetate and docetaxel.', 'Real-world survival outcomes of adding docetaxel or abiraterone in patients with high-volume metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: historically controlled, propensity score matched comparison with androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors in Addition to Docetaxel with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Overall Survival After Systemic Treatment in High-volume Versus Low-volume Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.', 'Current Management and Future Treatment Strategies for Patients with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Here, we examined familial prostate tumors for novel CNVs as prior studies suggest these harbor distinct CNVs. Array comparative genomic hybridization of 12 tumors from an Australian PrCa family, PcTas9, highlighted multiple recurrent CNVs, including amplification of EEF2 (19p13.3) in 100% of tumors. The EEF2 CNV was examined in a further 26 familial and seven sporadic tumors from the Australian cohort and in 494 tumors unselected for family history from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). EEF2 overexpression was observed in seven PcTas9 tumors, in addition to seven other predominantly familial tumors (ntotal = 34%). EEF2 amplification was only observed in 1.4% of TCGA tumors, however 7.5% harbored an EEF2 deletion. Analysis of genes co-expressed with EEF2 revealed significant upregulation of two genes, ZNF74 and ADSL, and downregulation of PLSCR1 in both EEF2 amplified familial tumors and EEF2 deleted TCGA tumors. Furthermore, in TCGA tumors, EEF2 amplification and deletion were significantly associated with a higher Gleason score. In summary, we identified a novel PrCa CNV that was predominantly amplified in familial tumors and deleted in unselected tumors. Our results provide further evidence that familial tumors harbor distinct CNVs, potentially due to an inherited predisposition, but also suggest that regardless of how EEF2 is dysregulated, a similar set of genes involved in key cancer pathways are impacted. Given the current lack of gene-based biomarkers and clinical targets in PrCa, further investigation of EEF2 is warranted.""","""['Kelsie Raspin', 'James R Marthick', 'Shaun Donovan', 'Leigh Blizzard', 'Roslyn C Malley', 'Chol-Hee Jung', 'Annette Banks', 'Frank Redwig', 'Marketa Skala', 'Joanne L Dickinson', 'Liesel M FitzGerald']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Genes Chromosomes Cancer""","""['Analysis of a large prostate cancer family identifies novel and recurrent gene fusion events providing evidence for inherited predisposition.', 'Germline copy number variation analysis in Finnish families with hereditary prostate cancer.', 'Characterization of germline copy number variation in high-risk African American families with prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide copy number analysis reveals candidate gene loci that confer susceptibility to high-grade prostate cancer.', 'Hereditary Predisposition to Prostate Cancer: From Genetics to Clinical Implications.']"""

Methods:   Patients with mCRPC who had progressed on docetaxel were enrolled at a single center from 2011 to 2013. Subjects received satraplatin 80 mg/m2 by mouth daily on days 1-5 and prednisone 5 mg PO twice daily, on a 35-day cycle. Serial peripheral blood samples were collected for biomarker assessment.  Results:   Thirteen docetaxel-refractory mCRPC patients were enrolled, with a median age of 69 years (range 54-77 years) and median PSA of 71.7 ng/mL (range 0.04-3057).

Estimation of the dosimetric uncertainty could potentially have impact in the process of comparing and selecting volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans. In this study, different measures for estimation of dosimetric uncertainty based on treatment plan parameters for plans with similar dose distributions were evaluated. VMAT plans with similar dose distributions but with different treatment plan designs were created using three different optimization methods for each of ten patient cases (tonsil and prostate cancer). Two plans were optimized in Eclipse, one with and one without the use of aperture shape controller, and one plan was optimized in RayStation. The studied measures related to dosimetric uncertainty of treatment plans were aperture-based complexity metric analysis, investigation of modulation level of multi leaf collimator leaves, gantry speed and dose rate, quasi-3D measurements and evaluation of simulations of realistic delivery variations. The results showed that there can be variations in dosimetric uncertainty for treatment plans with similar dose distributions. Dosimetric uncertainty assessment could therefore have impact on the choice of plan to be used for treatment and lead to a decrease in the uncertainty level of the delivered absorbed dose distribution.

As presented on the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis database, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) acts as a prostate cancer-promoting factor. ACAT1 expression in prostate cancer tissues is considerably higher than that in normal tissues, leading to a poor prognosis in patients with prostate cancer. Here, we aimed to study the role of the ACAT1-fused in sarcoma (FUS) complex in prostate cancer and identify new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.  Methods:   We conducted immunohistochemical analysis of 57 clinical samples and in vitro and in vivo experiments using a mouse model and plasmid constructs to determine the expression of ACAT1 in prostate cancer.  Results:   The relationship between the expression of ACAT1 and the Gleason score was significant. The expression of ACAT1 was higher in tissues with a Gleason score of > 7 than in tissues with a Gleason score of ≤7 (P = 0.0011). In addition, we revealed that ACAT1 can interact with the FUS protein.  Conclusions:   In prostate cancer, ACAT1 promotes the expression of P62 and Nrf2 through FUS and affects reactive oxygen species scavenging. These effects are due to the inhibition of autophagy by ACAT1. That is, ACAT1 promotes prostate cancer by inhibiting autophagy and eliminating active oxygen species.

This could influence the perception of the social burden of different diseases and treatment prioritization within national healthcare services. Cancer is a disease with a high disease burden in Japan; however, the age-specific frequency and age-specific mortality rates differ according to site. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the aging of the Japanese society and the disease burden by comparing the features of three cancers with different age-specific frequency rates in Japan. Furthermore, we made projections for the future to determine how the social burden of these cancers will change.  Methods:   We calculated the social burden of breast, lung, and prostate cancers by adding the direct, morbidity, and mortality costs. Estimates were made using the cost of illness (COI) method. For future projections, approximate curves were fitted for mortality rate, number of hospital admissions per population, number of outpatient visits per population, and average length of hospital stay according to sex and age.  Results:   The COI of breast, lung, and prostate cancers in 2017 was 903.7, 1,547.6, and 390.8 billion yen, respectively. Although the COI of breast and prostate cancers was projected to increase, that of lung cancer COI was expected to decrease. In 2017, the average age at death was 68.8, 76.8, and 80.7 years for breast, lung, and prostate cancers, respectively.  Conclusions:   Patients with breast cancer die earlier than those with other types of cancer. The COI of breast cancer (""young cancer"") was projected to increase slightly because of an increase in mortality costs, whereas that of prostate cancer (""aged cancer"") was projected to increase because of an increase in direct costs. The COI of lung cancer (""aging cancer"") was expected to decrease in 2020, despite the increase in deaths, as the impact of the decrease in human capital value outweighed that of the increase in deaths.

Besides, a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was followed to identify the biochemical pathways altered in DU145 cancer cells upon exposure to dihydroquinazolin derivatives. The seven compounds showed sufficient cytotoxicity and significantly suppressed DU145 and PC3 migration after 48 and 72 h.

The aim of the current study was to assess the chemopreventive efficacy of cinnamon (CN) and its bioactive compounds in vivo using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) and testosterone (T) to induce prostate carcinogenesis in male Wistar/National Institute of Nutrition rats. Cancer-induced (CI) rats (n = 10) developed prostatic hyperplasia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. These histopathologic changes were diminished in CI rats fed for 4 months with diets supplemented with either CN (n = 20) or its bioactive compounds (cinnamaldehyde, n = 10 and procyanidin B2, n = 10). Androgen receptor (AR) expression was lower in the prostates of CI rats than in control, but the AR target gene, probasin, was robustly upregulated. Treatment of CI rats with CN or its bioactive compounds upregulated AR expression but inhibited the expression of the 5-alpha reductase genes (Srd5a1 and Srd5a2) and did not further increase probasin expression, suggesting blunted transcriptional activity of AR due to the limited availability of dihydrotestosterone. MNU+T induced an altered oxidant status in rat prostate, which was reflected by an increase in lipid peroxidation and DNA oxidation. These changes were completely or partially corrected by treatment with CN or the bioactive compounds. CN and its active components increased the activity of the apoptotic enzymes caspase-8 and caspase-3 in the prostates of CI rats. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CN and its bioactive compounds have inhibitory effects on premalignant prostate lesions induced by MNU + T and, therefore, may be considered for the chemoprevention of prostate cancer.  Prevention relevance:   The research work presented in this article demonstrates the chemopreventive efficacy of CN and its bioactive compounds in a rat model of premalignant prostate cancer.""","""['Srividya Gopalakrishnan', 'Mahamaya Dhaware', 'Athira Anilkumar Sudharma', 'Surekha Venkata Mullapudi', 'Siva Ramakrishna Siginam', 'Ramesh Gogulothu', 'Irfan Ahmad Mir', 'Ayesha Ismail']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['Chemopreventive effects of zinc on prostate carcinogenesis induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea and testosterone in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.', 'Cynomorium songaricum Rupr demonstrates phytoestrogenic or phytoandrogenic like activities that attenuates benign prostatic hyperplasia via regulating steroid 5-α-reductase.', 'Inverse Regulation of DHT Synthesis Enzymes 5α-Reductase Types 1 and 2 by the Androgen Receptor in Prostate Cancer.', 'Differential expression of 5-alpha reductase isozymes in the prostate and its clinical implications.', 'Animal models for the study of prostate carcinogenesis.']"""

Objective:   To determine the immunologic response to the PROSTVAC vaccine and the clinical indicators of disease progression in patients with localized prostate cancer on AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a phase 2, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in 154 men with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer on AS.  Intervention:   Participants were randomized (2:1) to receive seven doses of subcutaneous PROSTVAC, a vaccinia/fowlpox viral vector-based immunotherapy containing a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) transgene and three T-cell co-stimulatory molecules, or an empty fowlpox vector (EV) over 140 d.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was the change from baseline in CD4 and CD8 T-cell infiltration in biopsy tumor tissue. Key secondary outcomes were safety and changes in prostate biopsy tumor pathology, peripheral antigen-specific T cells, and serum PSA. Continuous variables were compared using nonparametric tests. Categorical variables were compared using Fisher's exact test.  Results and limitations:   The PROSTVAC/EV vaccination was well tolerated. All except one participant completed the vaccination series. Changes in CD4 or CD8 density in biopsy tumor tissue did not differ between the PROSTVAC and EV arms. The proportions of patients with Gleason upgrading to grade group 3 after treatment was similar between the arms. There were no differences in postvaccination peripheral T-cell responses or the PSA change from baseline to 6-mo post-treatment follow-up between the groups.  Conclusions:   In this first-of-kind trial of immunotherapy in patients on AS for prostate cancer, PROSTVAC did not elicit more favorable prostate tissue or peripheral T-cell responses than the EV. There was no difference between the arms in clinicopathologic effects. Despite the null findings, this is the first study reporting the feasibility and acceptability of an immunotherapy intervention in the AS setting.  Patient summary:   We looked at responses after an experimental prostate cancer vaccine in patients with prostate cancer on active surveillance (AS).

In this work, we devised a combined ligand-based and structure-based multi-target repurposing strategy and applied it to a series of hexahydrocyclopenta[c]quinoline compounds synthesized previously. The in silico analyses identified human Carbonic Anhydrases (hCA) and Estrogen Receptors (ER) as top scoring candidates for dual modulation. hCA isoforms IX and XII, and ER subtypes ER⍺ and/or ERβ are co-expressed in various cancer cell types, including breast and prostate cancer cells. ER⍺ is the primary target of anti-estrogen therapy in breast cancer, and the hCA IX isoform is a therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer. ER⍺-mediated transcriptional programs and hCA activity in cancer cells promote favorable microenvironments for cell proliferation. Interestingly, several lines of evidence indicate that the combined modulation of these two targets may provide significant therapeutic benefits. Moving from these first results, two additional hexahydrocyclopenta[c]quinoline derivatives bearing a sulfonamide zinc binding group (hCA) and a phenolic hydroxyl (ER) pharmacophoric group placed at the appropriate locations were designed and synthesized. Interestingly, these compounds were able to directly modulate the activities of both hCA and ER targets. In cell-based assays, they inhibited proliferation of breast and prostate cancer cells with micromolar potency and cell type-selective efficacy. The compounds inhibited hCA activity with nanomolar potency and isoform-selectivity. In transactivation assays, they reduced estrogen-driven ER activity with micro-molar potency. Finally, crystal structures of the synthesized ligands in complex with the two targets revealed that the compounds bind directly to the hCA active site, as well as to the ER ligand-binding domain, providing structural explanation to the observed activity and a rationale for optimization of their dual activity. To the best of our knowledge, this work describes the design, synthesis and biological characterization of the first dual modulators of hCA and ER, laying the ground for the structure-based optimization of their multi-target activity.""","""['Annachiara Tinivella', 'Jerome C Nwachukwu', 'Andrea Angeli', 'Francesca Foschi', 'Anna Laura Benatti', 'Luca Pinzi', 'Tina Izard', 'Marta Ferraroni', 'Rangarajan Erumbi', 'Michael S Christodoulou', 'Daniele Passarella', 'Claudiu T Supuran', 'Kendall W Nettles', 'Giulio Rastelli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Med Chem""","""['Biological evaluation, radiosensitizing activity and structural insights of novel halogenated quinazoline-sulfonamide conjugates as selective human carbonic anhydrases IX/XII inhibitors.', 'Dual-tail arylsulfone-based benzenesulfonamides differently match the hydrophobic and hydrophilic halves of human carbonic anhydrases active sites: Selective inhibitors for the tumor-associated hCA IX isoform.', 'Synthesis, biological activity and multiscale molecular modeling studies of bis-coumarins as selective carbonic anhydrase IX and XII inhibitors with effective cytotoxicity against hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Discovery of curcumin inspired sulfonamide derivatives as a new class of carbonic anhydrase isoforms I, II, IX, and XII inhibitors.', 'Insights into the effect of elaborating coumarin-based aryl enaminones with sulfonamide or carboxylic acid functionality on carbonic anhydrase inhibitory potency and selectivity.']"""

In melanoma murine models, androgen receptor promotes metastases and androgen blockade potentiates antitumor vaccine efficacy. This phase I study evaluated the safety, efficacy, and pharmocodynamics of androgen deprivation with the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist triptorelin combined with nivolumab in male patients with melanoma resistant to anti-PD-1.  Patients and methods:   Adult male patients with advanced melanoma who progressed under anti-PD-1 containing regimens received triptorelin 3.75 mg every 4 weeks, nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and bicalutamide 50 mg once daily during the first 28 days. Tumor response was first assessed after 3 months; adverse events (AE) were monitored throughout the study.

Cancer-related distress explains the relationship between pain severity and interference, yet specificity of distress characteristics (e.g., hyperarousal, intrusive, or avoidant symptoms) in explaining associations between pain experiences and well-being has not been explored within APC. This study examined men with APC entering a clinical trial and tested associations of baseline pain, cancer-related distress, and physical and functional well-being.  Methods:   One hundred ninety men with APC enrolled in a randomized-controlled trial and were assessed prior to randomization. The McGill Pain Questionnaire assessed pain severity, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General captures physical and functional well-being. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised measured cancer-specific distress symptoms, including hyperarousal, avoidance, and intrusion symptoms. Controlling for age, cancer stage at diagnosis, income, education, and race/ethnicity, mediation models (SPSS PROCESS, model 4) tested whether cancer-specific distress accounted for the associations between pain severity and physical and functional well-being.  Results:   Men were on average 68 years of age, White non-Hispanic, with stage IV cancer. Pain severity was related to poorer physical (p < .001) and functional well-being (p < .001). Associations between pain severity and physical and functional well-being were partially mediated by greater intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms but not avoidant symptoms.  Conclusion:   For men with APC, intrusive and hyperarousal symptoms may partially explain the relationship between pain severity and decrements in physical and functional well-being. APC pain management should attend to such distress symptoms, which may contribute to interference if left unaddressed.

Methods:   Using a cross-sectional design, 555 prostate cancer patients completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9).  Results:   Network analysis and multidimensional scaling indicated that anhedonia was the most central symptom for these men, and that several sets of depression symptoms were closely associated with each other. These included anhedonia-depressed mood; sleeping problems-fatigue/lethargy; and suicidal ideation-low self-worth-depressed mood. Other depression symptoms such as appetite problems, concentration problems, and motor problems, were less well-related with the remainder of the network. Patients receiving treatment for reocurring prostate cancer (PCa) had significantly higher PHQ9 scores than patients undergoing their initial treatment, but no major differences in their network structures. Implications for clinical practice were derived from the relationships between individual depression symptoms and the overall depression network by examining node predictability.

Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) DCE MRI has shown promise in defining voxel-level biological characteristics. In this study we consider the relative value of qualitative, semi-quantitative and quantitative assessment of DCE MRI compared with diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted (T2w) imaging to detect prostate cancer at the voxel level.  Methods:   Seventy prostate cancer patients had multiparametric MRI prior to radical prostatectomy, including T2w, DWI and DCE MRI. Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) maps were computed from DWI, and semi-quantitative and quantitative parameters computed from DCE MRI. Tumour location and grade were validated with co-registered whole mount histology. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests were applied to determine whether MRI parameters in tumour and benign voxels were significantly different. Cohen's d was computed to quantify the most promising biomarkers. The Parker and Weinmann Arterial Input Functions (AIF) were compared for their ability to best discriminate between tumour and benign tissue. Classifier models were used to determine whether DCE MRI parameters improved tumour detection versus ADC and T2w alone.  Results:   All MRI parameters had significantly different data distributions in tumour and benign voxels. For low grade tumours, semi-quantitative DCE MRI parameter time-to-peak (TTP) was the most discriminating and outperformed ADC. For high grade tumours, ADC was the most discriminating followed by DCE MRI parameters Ktrans, the initial rate of enhancement (IRE), then TTP. Quantitative parameters utilising the Parker AIF better distinguished tumour and benign voxel values than the Weinmann AIF. Classifier models including DCE parameters versus T2w and ADC alone, gave detection accuracies of 78% versus 58% for low grade tumours and 85% versus 72% for high grade tumours.  Conclusions:   Incorporating DCE MRI parameters with DWI and T2w gives improved accuracy for tumour detection at a voxel level.

Docetaxel is widely used as a first-line drug for chemotherapy and shown to have a survival advantage. However, the role of docetaxel in tumor glycolysis remained poorly understood.  Methods:   The effect of Docetaxel in tumor glycolysis and proliferation were performed by CCK-8, Western blotting, real-time PCR, glucose, and lactate detection and IHC. ChIP and luciferase assay were used to analyze the mechanism of Docetaxel on Smad3-mediated HIF-1α transactivity.  Results:   In this study, we showed that docetaxel treatment led to a significant inhibition of cell proliferation in prostate cancer cells through PFKP-mediated glycolysis. Addition of lactate, a production of glycolysis, could reverse the inhibitory effect of docetaxel on cell proliferation. Further analysis has demonstrated that phosphorylation of Smad3 (Ser213) was drastically decreased in response to docetaxel stimulation, leading to reduce Smad3 nuclear translocation. Luciferase and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed that docetaxel treatment inhibited the binding of Smad3 to the promoter of the HIF-1α gene, suppressing transcriptional activation of HIF-1α. Moreover, ectopic expression of Smad3 in prostate cancer cells could overcome the decreased HIF-1α expression and its target gene PFKP caused by docetaxel treatment. Most importantly, endogenous Smad3 regulated and interacted with HIF-1α, and this interaction was destroyed in response to docetaxel treatment. What's more, both HIF-1α and PFKP expression were significantly reduced in prostate cancer received docetaxel treatment in vivo.  Conclusion:   These findings extended the essential role of docetaxel and revealed that docetaxel inhibited cell proliferation by targeting Smad3/HIF-1α signaling-mediated tumor Warburg in prostate cancer cells.

We retrospectively enrolled 394 patients with PSA levels of 4-20 ng/mL who underwent prebiopsy bpMRI during 2010-2021. Based on bpMRI and hematological indicators, six models and a nomogram were constructed to predict the outcomes of biopsy. Furthermore, we constructed and evaluated a risk scoring model based on the nomogram. Age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (PSAD), systemic immune-inflammation index, cystatin C level, and the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2.1 score were significant predictors of prostate cancer (PCa) on multivariable logistic regression analyses (P < 0.05) and the five parameters were used to construct the XYFY nomogram. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the nomogram was 0.916. Based on the nomogram, a risk scoring model (XYFY risk model) was constructed and then we divided the patients into low-(XYFY score: < 95), medium-(XYFY score: 95-150), and, high-risk (XYFY score: > 150) groups. The predictive values for diagnosis of PCa and clinically-significant PCa among the three risk groups were 3.0%(6/201), 41.8%(51/122), 91.5%(65/71); 0.5%(1/201), 19.7%(24/122), 60.6%(43/71), respectively.

Studies investigating surgical interventions are a critical asset in improving patient health outcomes. We aim to analyze the temporal and spatial distribution of the surgical treatment of Brazil's 5 most common types of cancer.  Methods:   The selected cancers were stomach, colorectal and rectosigmoid junction, bronchial and lung, breast, and prostatic. Surgical data were collected from the DATASUS database from 2013 to 2019. Statistical analyses included linear regression tests with a significance level of .05.  Results:   From 2013 to 2019, 19.72% of the diagnoses of all cancers were treated surgically. Only breast cancer didn't have a significant linear increase in surgeries (P = .702). Prostatic cancer had the highest annual increase rate and breast the lowest. Analyzing the Brazilian regions, the Southeast had the highest incidence of oncological surgeries, and the Midwest had the lowest.  Discussion:   Brazil's surgical oncology scenario is progressing positively through the analyzed period. The analysis of the 5 most common types of cancer in Brazil and their progression over the years provides an idea of the cancer surgery capacity in Brazil. There were disparities between the Brazilian regions in all types of cancer. Our study is the first step to better comprehending cancer care in Brazil and the access issues that some areas have.

The robust transcription of genes at such SEs is enabled by the formation of phase-separated condensates by transcription factors and coactivators with intrinsically disordered regions. The androgen receptor (AR), the main oncogenic driver in PCa, contains large disordered regions and is co-recruited with the transcriptional coactivator mediator complex subunit 1 (MED1) to SEs in androgen-dependent PCa cells, thereby promoting oncogenic transcriptional programs. In this work, we reveal that full-length AR forms foci with liquid-like properties in different PCa models. We demonstrate that foci formation correlates with AR transcriptional activity, as this activity can be modulated by changing cellular foci content chemically or by silencing MED1. AR ability to phase separate was also validated in vitro by using recombinant full-length AR protein. We also demonstrate that AR antagonists, which suppress transcriptional activity by targeting key regions for homotypic or heterotypic interactions of this receptor, hinder foci formation in PCa cells and phase separation in vitro. Our results suggest that enhanced compartmentalization of AR and coactivators may play an important role in the activation of oncogenic transcription programs in androgen-dependent PCa.""","""['Fan Zhang', 'Maitree Biswas', 'Shabnam Massah', 'Joseph Lee', 'Shreyas Lingadahalli', 'Samantha Wong', 'Christopher Wells', 'Jane Foo', 'Nabeel Khan', 'Helene Morin', 'Neetu Saxena', 'Sonia H Y Kung', 'Bei Sun', 'Ana Karla Parra Nuñez', 'Christophe Sanchez', 'Novia Chan', 'Lauren Ung', 'Umut Berkay Altıntaş', 'Jennifer M Bui', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Paul S Rennie', 'Nathan A Lack', 'Artem Cherkasov', 'Martin E Gleave', 'Jörg Gsponer', 'Nada Lallous']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['Darolutamide antagonizes androgen signaling by blocking enhancer and super-enhancer activation.', 'Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha interacts with the androgen receptor (AR) and promotes prostate cancer cell growth by activating the AR.', 'MiR137 is an androgen regulated repressor of an extended network of transcriptional coregulators.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Androgen receptor coactivators that inhibit prostate cancer growth.', 'Long-range gene regulation in hormone-dependent cancer.', 'Transcriptional condensates and phase separation: condensing information across scales and mechanisms.', 'Transcription factor condensates and signaling driven transcription.', 'Phase-separation: a possible new layer for transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoid receptor.', 'Advances in Nucleotide Repeat Expansion Diseases: Transcription Gets in Phase.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective CT and atlas-based sCT of 62 (53 IMRT and 9 VMAT) prostate cancer patients were used. For image similarity measurements, the sCT and reference CT (rCT) were aligned using clinical registration parameters. Conventional image similarity metrics including the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error (ME) were calculated. The water equivalent depth (WED) was automatically determined for each patient on the rCT and sCT as the distance from the skin surface to the treatment plan isocentre at 36 equidistant gantry angles, and the mean WED difference (ΔWED¯) between the two scans was calculated. Doses were calculated on each scan pair for the clinical plan in the treatment planning system. The image similarity measurements and ΔWED¯ were then compared to the isocentre dose difference (ΔDiso) between the two scans.  Results:   While no particular relationship to dose was observed for the other image similarity metrics, the ME results showed a linear trend against ΔDiso with R2 = 0.6, and the 95 % prediction interval for ΔDiso between -1.2 and 1 %. The ΔWED¯ results showed an improved linear trend (R2 = 0.8) with a narrower 95 % prediction interval from -0.8 % to 0.8 %.  Conclusion:   ΔWED¯ highly correlates with ΔDiso for the reference and synthetic CT scans. This is easy to calculate automatically and does not require time-consuming dose calculations.

However, in terms of functional outcomes, there are aspects that still need improvements. We designed this prospective phase I/II clinical trial to assess the safety, clinical feasibility, and functional outcomes of hypothermic robot-assisted RP (RARP). Material and Methods: Twenty patients with preoperative total 5-item International Index of Erectile Function scores ≥12 points, scheduled for RARP, were enrolled in the study. Pelvic hypothermia was induced using an endorectal cooling device (BelloCool System). The primary outcome was the completion rate of the planned hypothermic RARP. Secondary outcomes included the drop in neurovascular bundle (NVB) temperature, adverse (including device-related) events, continence, and potency recoveries, and postoperative quality of life. Contemporaneous patients (propensity score-matched for baseline characteristics) who satisfied the inclusion criteria were included in the control group. Results: The completion rate of the planned hypothermic surgery was 100%. The nadir NVB temperature was 24.9 [22.4, 28.2]°C, which was 10.2 [7.0, 13.1]°C lower than the nadir core body temperature. There was no device-related adverse event, and bowel function was well preserved for the whole follow-up period. At 12 months postoperatively, potency and continence recovery rates were higher in the hypothermic group than in the control group (40% vs 15%, p = 0.027 and 95% vs 80%, p = 0.167, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed faster recovery rate of potency in the hypothermic group (hazard ratios = 3.46, log-rank p < 0.01). Conclusions: Hypothermic RARP using the BelloCool™ endorectal cooling system is safe and feasible.

Methods:   Multicenter, retrospective analysis of 475 consecutive patients with ISUP ≤ 2 PCa at MRI-TB + SB is treated with RP. AO were defined as ISUP upgrading, adverse pathology (upgrading to ISUP ≥ 3 and/or ≥ pT3 at RP, and/or pN1) (AP) or biochemical recurrence (BCR) in men with follow-up (n = 327).  Results:   The rate of ISUP upgrading, upgrading ≥ 3, and AP were 39%, 21%, and 43%. Compared to ISUP2, men with ISUP1 PCa had a higher rate of overall upgrading (27 vs. 67%, p < 0.001), but less upgrading to ≥ 3 (27 vs. 10%, p < 0.001). AP was more common when ISUP2 was detected with a combined MRI-TB + SB approach compared to considering TB (p = 0.02) or SB (p = 0.01) alone. PSA, PSA density, PI-RADS, ISUP at TB, overall biopsy ISUP and EAU classification were predictors of upgrading to ISUP ≥ 3 and AP. The 1 year BCR-free survival was 94% with no differences in BCR rates between subgroups.  Conclusion:   Upgrading in ISUP ≤ 2 PCa remains prevalent even in men diagnosed in the MRI era.

SphK1 is expressed as two major isoforms, SphK1a and SphK1b. To date, no information has been reported on the SphK1 isoform expression profile and its clinical relevance.  Objective:   The objective is to examine the expression profile of the SphK1a and SPhK1b isoforms in human cancer and noncancer tissues and cell lines and explore their clinical relevance.  Methods:   We used PCR to qualitatively examine the expression profile of these two isoforms in breast, liver, and prostate cancer tissues plus paired adjacent tissues and in 11 cancer and normal cell lines (breast, cervical, bone, prostate, colon, brain, mesothelioma tumor and benign, and human kidney cells).  Results:   We found that SphK1a was ubiquitously expressed in all cancer cells and tissues tested; in contrast, SphK1b was only expressed in selective cell types in breast, prostate, and lung cancer.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that SphK1a is important for generic SphK1/S1P functions, and SphK1b mediates specialized and/or unique pathways in a specific type of tissue and could be a biomarker for cancer.

Chronic inflammation has been implicated in PC etiology. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-23 and IL-17 are key mediators to promote growth of PC. Here, we evaluate the potential of immunoproteasome inhibition for anti-inflammatory and direct anti-tumorigenic therapy of PC. The anti-tumor effect of immunoproteasome inhibitor ONX 0914 was tested in mouse and human PC cells and the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of immunoproteasome inhibition was analyzed in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice in preventive and therapeutic settings and in castration-resistant (CR)PC after castration. Inhibition of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 induced apoptotic cell death in PC cell lines. In TRAMP mice, ONX 0914-treatment resulted in significant inhibition of PC growth with a decreased frequency of malignant prostatic lesions and inhibition of metastasis formation. The number of immunosuppressive myeloid cells in PC was greatly reduced in response to ONX 0914. Thus, immunoproteasome inhibition shows remarkable efficacy against PC progression in vivo and impedes tumor recurrence in CRPC-TRAMP mice by blocking the immunosuppressive inflammatory response in the tumor microenvironment. In conclusion, we show that the immunoproteasome is a promising drug target for the treatment of PC.""","""['Julia Koerner', 'Dennis Horvath', 'Franziska Oliveri', 'Jun Li', 'Michael Basler']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Immunoproteasome inhibition prevents progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition and deficiency of the immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 suppress the development and progression of colorectal carcinoma in mice.', 'ONX 0914 Lacks Selectivity for the Cardiac Immunoproteasome in CoxsackievirusB3 Myocarditis of NMRI Mice and Promotes Virus-Mediated Tissue Damage.', 'Inhibition of the Immunoproteasome Subunit LMP7 with ONX\xa00914 Ameliorates Graft-versus-Host Disease in an MHC-Matched\xa0Minor Histocompatibility Antigen-Disparate Murine Model.', 'Immunoproteasome inhibition prevents chronic antibody-mediated allograft rejection in renal\xa0transplantation.', 'Trial watch: chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death in oncology.']"""

Patients and methods:   Since 2014, we prospectively register mHSPCpatients. Patients were grouped in 4 time periods: group 1 (Time period 1, January 2014-July 2015), group 2 after introduction of docetaxel (Time period 2, August 2015-July 2017), group 3 after introduction of abiraterone acetate (Time period 3, August 2017-February 2018) and group 4 after introduction of apalutamide (Time period 4, March 2018-October 2021). For every time period, we evaluated the initiated additional ST. In case patients received treatment that differed from contemporary SOC according to guidelines, reasons for this difference were explored.  Results:   In total, 243 patients were included. A progressive decline in ADT monotherapy from 85% to 29% over time was observed. The proportion of patients receiving additional STs increased from 34% to 59%. Forty percent of patients were not treated according to contemporary SOC, but this percentage varied strongly per time period (10%, 67%, 53%, and 32% from time period 1 to time period 4 respectively). Reasons for these variations were heterogenous and varied across the 4 time periods. Patients being unfit for treatment and treating physicians failing to consider additional STs were the most prevalent reasons. The proportion of patients unfit for additional ST decreased from 18% to 4% over time.  Conclusion:   Use of ADT monotherapy declined gradually after the introduction of additional systemic treatments. The proportion of patients unfit for additional ST declined as more treatments became available. Although compliance to SOC increased over time, these real-world data show that adherence to clinical practice guidelines remains suboptimal. Efforts should be made by clinicians to increase the adherence to practice guidelines.""","""['Edward Lambert', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Valerie Fonteyne', 'Daan De Maeseneer', 'Sofie Verbeke', 'Geert Villeirs', 'Kathia De Man', 'Charles Van Praet']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Treatment of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) in Belgium: a real world data analysis.', 'Impact of next-generation hormonal agents on treatment patterns among patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a real-world study from the United States, five European countries and Japan.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Triplet or Doublet Therapy in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors in Addition to Docetaxel with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Despite all the available treatment options and high survival rates in children with retinoblastoma, exposure to secondary tumours in adulthood is one of the concerns that physicians face. In many cases, dysfunction of the RB1 gene is the main cause of secondary tumours due to retinoblastoma. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of other secondary tumours in children with retinoblastoma.  Methods:   In this regard, we performed continuous and integrated bioinformatics analyses to find genes, protein products, and signal pathways involved in other cancers.  Results:   1170 high-expression genes and 960 low-expression genes between non-invasive and invasive retinoblastoma were isolated. After examining the signal pathways, we observed bladder cancer and small cell lung cancer in the overexpressed genes. We also observed 5 cancers of endometriosis, prostate, non-small cell lung cancer, glioblastoma and renal cell carcinoma in low-expression genes. Based on the P-value index, non-small cell lung cancer, prostate and bladder cancers had the highest risk, and endometriosis cancer showed a lower probability of developing a secondary tumour in patients with retinoblastoma. In addition, the network between proteins also showed us that TP53, CDK2, SRC, MAPK1 proteins with high expression and JUN, HSP90AA1, and UBC proteins with low-expression play a significant role in candidate cancers.  Conclusion:   Lastly, we used continuous bioinformatics analysis to show that seven cancers are strongly linked to retinoblastoma cancer.

Randomization to the LDR-PB arm resulted in a 2-fold reduction in biochemical progression compared with the DE-EBRT group at a median follow-up of 6.5 years (P < .001). Herein, the primary endpoint and secondary survival endpoints of the ASCENDE-RT trial are updated at a 10-year median follow-up.  Methods:   Patients were randomly assigned to either the LDR-PB or the DE-EBRT arm (1:1). All patients received 1 year of androgen deprivation therapy and 46 Gy in 23 fractions of pelvic RT. Patients in the DE-EBRT arm received an additional 32 Gy in 16 fractions, and those in the LDR-PB arm received an 125I implant prescribed to a minimum peripheral dose of 115 Gy.

Conflicting evidence exists regarding familial PrCa and clinical outcomes among PrCa patients, including all-cause mortality/overall survival (OS), PrCa-specific survival (PCSS), aggressive histology, and stage at diagnosis.  Objective:   To determine how the number, degree, and age of a PrCa patient's affected relatives are associated with OS and PCSS of those already diagnosed with PrCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   The UK Genetic Prostate Cancer Study is a longitudinal, multi-institutional, observational study collecting baseline and follow-up clinical data since 1992. We examined OS and PCSS in 16340 men by degree and number of relatives with prostate and genetically related cancers (breast, ovarian, and colorectal).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was all-cause mortality among PrCa patients. The risk of death with respect to FH was assessed by calculating hazard ratios from Cox proportional hazard regression models, adjusting for relevant factors.  Results and limitations:   A stronger FH was inversely associated with the risk of all-cause and PrCa-specific mortality. This association was greater in those with an increasing number (p-trend < 0.001) and increasing closeness (p-trend < 0.001) of the diagnosed relatives. Patients with at least one first-degree relative were at a lower risk of all-cause mortality than those with no FH (hazard ratio = 0.82 [95% confidence interval 0.75-0.89]). The population is largely of European ancestry, and this may cause an issue with representation and generalisation. Data are missing on epidemiological risk factors for death such as smoking and on comorbidities. Recall of family members' diagnoses may affect the classification of FH in unconfirmed cases.  Conclusions:   Based on the investigation of the type and timing of relatives' cancers, it is likely that reductions in mortality are due almost completely to a greater awareness of the disease. This study provides information for clinicians guiding patients and their relatives based on their familial risk. It shows the importance of screening and awareness programmes, which are likely to improve survival among men with an FH.  Patient summary:   We were interested in how a family history of prostate cancer affects survival in prostate cancer patients. We studied 16340 patients, categorised them according to the strength of their family history, and found that the stronger their family history, the better they did in terms of overall survival. We looked at the type and timing of patients' diagnoses compared with those of their relatives and found that this effect is likely to be explained by awareness, which indicates the importance of screening and awareness programmes.""","""['Mark N Brook', 'Holly Ní Raghallaigh', 'Koveela Govindasami', 'Tokhir Dadaev', 'Reshma Rageevakumar', 'Diana Keating', 'Nafisa Hussain', 'Andrea Osborne', 'Artitaya Lophatananon;UKGPCS Collaborators;Kenneth R Muir', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Rosalind A Eeles']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""[""Reply to Kari Hemminki, Jianguang Ji, and Jan Sundquist's Letter to the Editor re: Mark N.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the resultant contingency plans on radiotherapy cancer services in Scotland.  Materials and methods:   Detailed data of radiotherapy activity at our centre were collected from 1 April 2019 to 31 March 2021. Differences in mean weekly radiotherapy courses, dose and fractionation patterns and treatment intent were compared with corresponding pre-pandemic months for all treatment sites. Qualitative data were collected for a subgroup of radical radiotherapy patients.  Results:   Total radiotherapy courses decreased from 6968 to 6240 (-10%) compared with the previous year, prior to the pandemic. Average weekly radiotherapy courses delivered were 134 (standard deviation ±13), decreasing by 10% to 120 (standard deviation 15) (Welch's t-test, P < 0.001). The greatest decrease in new start treatment courses was observed from May to August 2020 (-7.7%, -24.0%, -16.7% and -18.7%) compared with the corresponding months in 2019. A significant reduction was seen for female patients <70 years (-16%) compared with females >70 years (-8%) or their male counterparts (-7% and -6%, respectively). By diagnosis, the largest reductions between pre- and post-pandemic levels were for anal (-26%), breast (-18%) and prostate (-14%) cancer. Contrarily, a significant increase was found for bladder (28%) and oesophageal (11%) cancers.  Conclusions:   Over the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, radiotherapy activity significantly decreased compared with the 12 months prior. Due to issued guidance, the use of hypofractionated regimens increased, contributing to the reduction in treatments for some tumour sites. An increase in other tumour sites can probably be attributed to the reduction or cancellation of surgical interventions. These results will inform our understanding of the indirect consequences of the pandemic on radiotherapy services.""","""['L Grocutt', 'A Rutherford', 'D Caldwell', 'C Wilkinson', 'A J Chalmers', 'L Dempsey', 'C Kelly', ""S M O'Cathail""]""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiotherapy services in England, UK: a population-based study.', 'Reduced Fractionation in Lung Cancer Patients Treated with Curative-intent Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Whole-population trends in pathology-confirmed cancer incidence in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A retrospective observational study.', 'Impact of the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic on Radiotherapy Practice at Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.', 'Substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic: What is really happening?']"""

Whether exercise improves QoL in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is not fully understood.  Methods:   We conducted a 3-arm pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and efficacy of a 12-week remotely monitored exercise program among men with mCRPC. Here we report qualitative changes in QoL, consistent with the guidelines for pilot trials. Men were randomized to control, aerobic exercise, or resistance exercise. Exercise prescriptions were based on baseline cardiorespiratory and strength assessments. QoL outcomes were evaluated using self-reported questionnaires (e.g., QLQ-C30, PROMIS Fatigue, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), EPIC-26) collected at baseline and 12 weeks.  Results:   A total of 25 men were randomized (10 control, 8 aerobic, 7 resistance). Men were predominately white (76%) with a median age of 71 years (range: 51-84) and 10.5 years (range: 0.9-26.3) post prostate cancer diagnosis. The men reported poor sleep quality and high levels of fatigue at enrollment. Other baseline QoL metrics were relatively high. Compared to the controls at 12 weeks, the resistance arm reported some improvements in social function and urinary irritative/obstruction symptoms while the aerobic arm reported some improvements in social function and urinary incontinence, yet worsening nausea/vomiting.

The ETS transcription factor ELK-1 serves as a paradigm for cellular responses to mitogens and can synergise with androgen receptor to promote prostate cancer progression, although in vitro protein function analyses to date have largely overlooked its complex PTM landscapes. We expressed and purified human ELK-1 using mammalian (HEK293T), insect (Sf9) and bacterial (E. coli) systems in parallel and compared PTMs imparted upon purified proteins, along with their performance in DNA and protein interaction assays. Phosphorylation of ELK-1 within its transactivation domain, known to promote DNA binding, was most apparent in protein isolated from human cells and accordingly conferred the strongest DNA binding in vitro, while protein expressed in insect cells bound most efficiently to the androgen receptor. We observed lysine acetylation, a hitherto unreported PTM of ELK-1, which appeared highest in insect cell-derived ELK-1 but was also present in HEK293T-derived ELK-1. Acetylation of ELK-1 was enhanced in HEK293T cells following starvation and mitogen stimulation, and modified lysines showed overlap with previously identified regulatory SUMOylation and ubiquitination sites. Our data demonstrate that the choice of recombinant expression system can be tailored to suit biochemical application rather than to maximise soluble protein production and suggest the potential for crosstalk and antagonism between different PTMs of ELK-1.""","""['Charles Ducker', 'Manohar Ratnam', 'Peter E Shaw', 'Robert Layfield']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Protein Expr Purif""","""['ELK-1 ubiquitination status and transcriptional activity are modulated independently of F-Box protein FBXO25.', 'Characterization of the Elk-1 ETS DNA-binding domain.', 'p38 MAPK pathway-dependent SUMOylation of Elk-1 and phosphorylation of PIAS2 correlate with the downregulation of Elk-1 activity in heat-stressed HeLa cells.', 'Crosstalk between Ubiquitination and Other Post-translational Protein Modifications in Plant Immunity.', 'Critical Protein-Protein Interactions Determine the Biological Activity of Elk-1, a Master Regulator of Stimulus-Induced Gene Transcription.']"""

Therefore, the serum response factor (Srf) and the activation of the serum response element (SRE) by acidosis were analysed in AT-1 prostate carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the expression of downstream targets of this cascade, namely the early growth response 1 (Egr1), which seems to be involved in tumour proliferation, and the cellular communication network factor 1 (Ccn1), which both contain SRE in their promotor region were examined in two tumour cell lines. Extracellular acidification led to an upregulation of Srf and a functional activation of the SRE. Egr1 expression was increased by acidosis in AT-1 cells whereas hypoxia had a suppressive effect. In experimental tumours, in vivo Egr1 and Ccn1 were also found to be acidosis-dependent. Also, it turned out that pH regulated expression of Egr1 was followed by comparable changes of p21, which is an important regulator of the cell cycle.This study identifies the Srf-SRE signalling cascade and downstream Egr1 and Ccn1 to be acidosis-regulated in vitro and in vivo, potentially affecting tumour progression.

Increased antibiotic resistance has led to the suspension of indication for fluoroquinolones use in prostate biopsy prophylaxis. Several classes of antibiotics have been recommended for routine use. Unequivocal consensus regarding antibiotic prophylaxis has not been made to date. The objective of the study was to assess the diversity of antimicrobial prophylaxis among Croatian urologists.  Materials and methods:   An online questionnaire was designed using Google Forms® and distributed to 19 urology public hospital's departments. Answers regarding infection risk assessment, type and duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis were accumulated. Descriptive statistical analysis was preformed using Statistica 10.0® analytics software.  Results:   Twelve urology departments answered the questionnaire, representing 63% of urology departments in Croatia. Six different antibiotic protocols have been reported. Fluoroquinolones were the most commonly prescribed class of antibiotics (84%). Antibiotic prophylaxis started 1 day before the procedure (92%). Average duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was 5 days (75%). In case of increased risk of urinary tract infection, 42% of departments changed the type, and 8% changed the duration of antibiotic prophylaxis. Neither department performed a rectal swab prior to prostate biopsy.  Conclusions:   Various antimicrobial prophylaxis protocols are currently being used among Croatian urology departments.

Methods:   We performed a prospective 3 T MRI study comparing the clinical and MRI data on pECE obtained from patients treated using robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) at our institution. The covariates under consideration were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, the patient's age, prostate volume, and MRI interpretative features for predicting pECE based on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.0 (v2), as well as tumor capsular contact length (TCCL), length of the index lesion, and prostate biopsy Gleason score (GS).

We also recruited an additional set of participants-which included 59 patients from external institutions-to validate the model.  Results:   The study participants included 184 patients who had undergone RARP at our institution, 26% of whom were pECE+ (i.e., pECE positive). Significant predictors of pECE+ were TCCL, capsular disruption, measurable ECE on MRI, and a GS of ≥7(4 + 3) on a prostate biopsy. The strongest predictor of pECE+ is measurable ECE on MRI, and in its absence, a combination of TCCL and prostate biopsy GS was significantly effective for detecting the patient's risk of being pECE+. Our predictive model showed a satisfactory performance at distinguishing between patients with pECE+ and patients with pECE-, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.90 (86.0-95.8%), high sensitivity (86%), and moderate specificity (70%).  Conclusions:   Our predictive model, based on consistent MRI features (i.e., measurable ECE and TCCL) and a prostate biopsy GS, has satisfactory performance and sufficiently high sensitivity for predicting pECE+.

Understanding the neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) process at the molecular level is therefore critical to define therapeutic strategies that can prevent multi-drug resistance.  Methods:   Using RNA expression profiling and immunohistochemistry, we have identified and characterised a gene expression signature associated with the emergence of NED in a large PCa cohort, including 169 hormone-naïve PCa (HNPC) and 48 castration-resistance PCa (CRPC) patients. In vitro and preclinical in vivo NED models were used to explore the cellular mechanism and to characterise the effects of castration on PCa progression.  Results:   We show for the first time that Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a key component of NED in PCa cells. NRP1 is upregulated in response to androgen deprivation therapies (ADT) and elicits cell survival through induction of the PKC pathway. Downmodulation of either NRP1 protein expression or PKC activation suppresses NED, prevents tumour evolution toward castration resistance and increases the efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy in preclinical models in vivo.

Brachytherapy treatment involved a transperineal implant of iodine-125 to a dose of 145 Gy to the PTV, while HF-EBRT was delivered using intensity modulated radiotherapy with 60 Gy in 20 fractions. The Phoenix ''nadir +2'' threshold was used to define biochemical relapse (BR).

Patients and methods:   Fifteen patients with prostate cancer and an MR-detected dominant lesion were treated on the MR-Linac with stereotactic body radiation (SBRT) to 40 Gy in 5 fractions, boosting the gross tumor volume (GTV) to 45 Gy with daily adaptive planning. Imaging was acquired again after initial planning (verification scan), and immediately after treatment (post-treatment scan). Prior to beam-on, additional adjustments were made on the verification scan. Contours were retrospectively adjusted on verification and post-treatment scans, and the daily plan recalculated on these scans to estimate the true dose delivered.  Results:   The median prostate D95% for plan 1, 2 and 3 was 40.3 Gy, 40.5 Gy and 40.3 Gy and DIL D95% was 45.7 Gy, 45.2 Gy and 44.6 Gy, respectively.

Thymic involution leads to a decrease in the generation of recent thymic emigrants (RTEs), resulting in a reduced response to immune challenges such as cancer. Interestingly, the standard of care for prostate cancer patients is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which leads to thymic regeneration and an increase in thymic output. It remains unknown whether these newly produced T cells can contribute to the antitumor immune response. This study defines the kinetics of thymic regeneration in response to ADT in mice, determining that thymic epithelial cell proliferation is critical for the increase in RTE output. Using a mouse model to track RTE in vivo, we demonstrate that these newly generated RTEs can traffic to tumors, where they become activated and produce effector cytokines at levels similar to more mature T cells. Collectively, these data suggest that RTEs produced from ADT-induced thymic regeneration could be harnessed for the antitumor immune response.""","""['Fanny Polesso', 'Breanna Caruso', 'Scott A Hammond', 'Amy E Moran']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Immunol""","""['Androgen Receptors in Epithelial Cells Regulate Thymopoiesis and Recent Thymic Emigrants in Male Mice.', 'Immune system and intestinal microbiota determine efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy against prostate cancer.', 'Impact of androgen-deprivation therapy on the immune system: implications for combination therapy of prostate cancer.', 'Human CD4+ T cell recent thymic emigrants are identified by protein tyrosine kinase 7 and have reduced immune function.', 'Thymic Function Associated With Cancer Development, Relapse, and Antitumor Immunity - A Mini-Review.']"""

Prostate cancer has few established risk factors though night shift work, a probable human carcinogen, may increase the risk. We aimed to study the association between night shift work and chlorinated degreasing agents (CDAs) as possible endocrine disrupters in relation to aggressive prostate cancer as verified malignancies.  Methods:   We conducted a case-cohort study on 299 aggressive prostate cancer cases and 2056 randomly drawn non-cases in the Norwegian Offshore Petroleum Workers cohort (1965-98) with linkage to the Cancer Registry of Norway (1953-2019). Work history was recorded as years with day, night, and rollover (rotating) shift work, and CDA exposure was assessed with expert-made job-exposure matrices. Weighted Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for aggressive prostate cancer, adjusted for education and year of first employment, stratified by 10-year birth cohorts, and with 10, 15, and 20 years of exposure lag periods.  Results:   Compared with day work only, an increased hazard of aggressive prostate cancer (HR = 1.86, 95% CI 1.18-2.91; P-trend = 0.046) was found in workers exposed to ≥19.5 years of rollover shift work. This persisted with longer lag periods (HR = 1.90, 95% CI 0.92-3.95; P-trend = 0.007). The exposure-hazard curve for a non-linear model increased linearly (HRs ≥1.00) for 18-26 years of rollover shift work. No association was found with CDA exposure.

Objective:   To assess whether greater beneficiary-hospital ACO alignment was associated with lower surgical episode costs.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2020 and 2022 using US Medicare data from a 20% random sample of beneficiaries. Individuals 18 years of age and older and without kidney failure who had a surgical admission between 2008 and 2015 were included. For each study year, distinction was made between beneficiaries assigned to an ACO and those who were not, as well as between admissions to ACO-participating and nonparticipating hospitals.  Exposures:   Time-varying binary indicators for beneficiary ACO assignment and hospital ACO participation and an interaction between them.  Main outcomes and measures:   Ninety-day, price-standardized total episode payments. Multivariable 2-way fixed-effects models were estimated.  Results:   During the study period, 2 797 337 surgical admissions (6% of which involved ACO-assigned beneficiaries) occurred at 3427 hospitals (17% ACO participating). Total Medicare payments for 90-day surgical episodes were lowest when ACO-assigned beneficiaries underwent surgery at a hospital participating in the same ACO as the beneficiary ($26 635 [95% CI, $26 426-$26 844]). The highest payments were for unassigned beneficiaries treated at participating hospitals ($27 373 [95% CI, $27 232-$27 514]) or nonparticipating hospitals ($27 303 [95% CI, $27 291-$27 314]). Assigned beneficiaries treated at hospitals participating in a different ACO and assigned beneficiaries treated at nonparticipating hospitals had similar payments (for participating hospitals, $27 003 [95% CI, $26 739-$27 267] and for nonparticipating hospitals, $26 928 [95% CI, $26 796-$27 059]). A notable factor in the observed differences in surgical episode costs was lower spending on postacute care services.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study evaluating hospital and beneficiary ACO alignment and surgical spending, savings were noted for beneficiaries treated at hospitals in the same ACO.

Currently, most research focuses on castration-resistant tumors, and the role of tumors in remission is almost completely ignored. Here, we report that odorant-binding protein (OBP2A) released from tumors in remission during ADT catches survival factors, such as CXCL15/IL8, to promote PCa cell androgen-independent growth and enhance the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into tumor microenvironment, leading to the emergence of castration resistance. OBP2A knockdown significantly inhibits CRPC and metastatic CRPC development and improves therapeutic efficacy of CTLA-4/PD-1 antibodies. Treatment with OBP2A-binding ligand α-pinene interrupts the function of OBP2A and suppresses CRPC development. Furthermore, α-pinene-conjugated doxorubicin/docetaxel can be specifically delivered to tumors, resulting in improved anticancer efficacy.

Methods:   Patients with post-radical prostatectomy PSA levels of ≥0.1-2.0 ng/mL and/or local relapse at PSMA PET/CT or multiparametric MRI were treated with Linac-based SBRT on the prostate bed up to a total dose of 32.5 Gy in five fractions every other day (EQD21.5 = 74.2 Gy). Maximum acute toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 scale. International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) scores were assessed at baseline and during the follow-up.  Results:   From April 2021 to June 2022, thirty men with a median age of 72 years (range 55-82) were enrolled in three centers. The median PSA level before RT was 0.30 ng/mL (range 0.18-1.89 ng/mL). At 3 months post-treatment, no GI or ≥2 GU side effects were reported; three patients (10%) experienced Grade 1 GU toxicity. No changes in ICIQ-SF or in the urinary domains of EPIC-CP were observed, while a transient worsening was registered in the bowel domain. At the same time point, all but two patients, who progressed distantly, were found to be biochemically controlled with a median post-treatment PSA level of 0.07 ng/mL (range 0-0.48 ng/mL).

However, few studies have reported the use of tempol in prostate cancer (PCa). The present study investigated the effects of tempol on inflammation related to NF-κB signaling, using hormone-dependent or hormone-independent cell lines and the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate PCa animal model in the early and late stages of cancer progression.  Methods:   PC-3 and LnCaP cells were exposed to different tempol doses in vitro, and cell viability assays were performed. The optimal treatment dose was chosen for subsequent analysis using western blotting. Five experimental groups were evaluated in vivo to test for tempol effects in the early (CT12 and TPL12 groups) and late stages (CT20, TPL20-I, and TLP20-II) of PCa development. The TPL groups were treated with 50 or 100 mg/kg tempol. All control groups received water as the vehicle. The ventral lobe of the prostate was collected and subjected to immunohistochemical and western blot analysis.  Results:   Tempol treatment reduced cellular proliferation in vitro and improved prostatic morphology in vivo, thereby decreasing tumor progression. Tempol reduced inflammation in preclinical models, and downregulated the initial inflammatory signaling through toll-like receptors, not always mediated by the MyD88 pathway. In addition, it upregulated iκB-α and iκB -β levels, leading to a decrease in NF-κB, TNF-α, and other inflammatory markers. Tempol also influenced cell survival markers.  Conclusions:   Tempol can be considered a beneficial therapy for PCa treatment owing to its anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative effects. Nevertheless, the action of tempol was different depending on the degree of the prostatic lesion in vivo and hormone reliance in vitro. This indicates that tempol plays a multifaceted role in the prostatic tissue environment.""","""['Isabela Rossetto', 'Felipe Santos', 'Larissa Kido', 'Celina Lamas', 'Fábio Montico', 'Valéria Cagnon']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Anti-inflammatory therapies in TRAMP mice: delay in PCa progression.', 'Nintedanib antiangiogenic inhibitor effectiveness in delaying adenocarcinoma progression in Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP).', 'Ectopic fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 promotes inflammation by promoting nuclear factor-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'Recent insights into NF-κB signalling pathways and the link between inflammation and prostate cancer.']"""

Previously, we found that the overall decreased risk of prostate cancer diagnosis in males with a high intake of phytoestrogens was strongly modified by a nucleotide sequence variant in the estrogen receptor-beta (ERβ) gene. However, we do not know if phytoestrogens can inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in males with established diseases. If there is an inhibition or a delay, there is reason to believe that different variants of the ERβ gene will modify the effect. Therefore, we designed an intervention study to investigate the effect of the addition of foods high in phytoestrogens and their interaction with the ERβ genotype on prostate tumor proliferation in patients with prostate cancer.  Method:   The PRODICA trial is a randomized ongoing intervention study in patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer with a Gleason score < 8, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20, and scheduled for radical prostatectomy. The study is conducted at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg, Sweden. The intervention consists of a daily intake of soybeans and flaxseeds (~ 200 mg of phytoestrogens) until the surgery, approximately 6 weeks. The aim is to recruit 200 participants. The primary outcome is the difference in the proliferation marker Ki-67 between the intervention and the control groups. The genotype of ERβ will be investigated as an effect-modifying factor. Secondary outcomes include, e.g., concentrations of PSA and steroid hormones in the blood.  Discussion:   The results of the PRODICA trial will contribute important information on the relevance of increasing the intake of phytoestrogens in patients with prostate cancer who want to make dietary changes to improve the prognosis of their cancer. If genetic factors turn out to influence the effect of the intervention diet, dietary advice can be given to patients who most likely benefit from it. Dietary interventions are cost-effective, non-invasive, and result in few mild side effects. Lastly, the project will provide basic pathophysiological insights which could be relevant to the development of treatment strategies for patients with prostate cancer.

To capture chromatin interactions of regulatory elements, 3C-derived methods such as Hi-C and Micro-C are developed. Here, we generated and analyzed Hi-C, Micro-C, and promoter capture Micro-C datasets with different sequencing depths to study chromatin interactions of regulatory elements and nucleosome positions in human prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Compared to Hi-C, Micro-C identifies more high-resolution loops, including ones around structural variants. By evaluating the effect of sequencing depth, we revealed that more than 2 billion reads of Micro-C are needed to detect chromatin interactions at 1 kb resolution. Moreover, we found that deep-sequencing identifies additional long-range loops that are longer than 1 Mb in distance. Furthermore, we found that more than 50% of the loops are involved in insulators while less than 10% of the loops are promoter-enhancer loops. To comprehensively capture chromatin interactions that promoters are involved in, we performed promoter capture Micro-C. Promoter capture Micro-C identifies loops near promoters with a lower amount of sequencing reads. Sequencing of 160 million reads of promoter capture Micro-C resulted in reaching a plateau of identifying loops. However, there was still a subset of promoters that are not involved in loops even after deep-sequencing. By integrating Micro-C with NOMe-seq and ChIP-seq, we found that active promoters involved in loops have a more accessible region with lower levels of DNA methylation and more highly phased nucleosomes, compared to active promoters that are not involved in loops.  Conclusion:   We determined the required sequencing depth for Micro-C and promoter capture Micro-C to generate high-resolution chromatin interaction maps and loops. We also investigated the effect of sequencing coverage of Hi-C, Micro-C, and promoter capture Micro-C on detecting chromatin loops. Our analyses suggest the presence of distinct regulatory element groups, which are differently involved in nucleosome positions and chromatin interactions.

Histologically, they were all prostatic acinar adenocarcinomas. These adenocarcinomas were well differentiated (48%) and moderately differentiated (38%). The predominant histoprognostic grade was ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) grade 1 which was noted in 65.52%, followed by grade 2 in 20.69%.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer in men under 50 years of age is relatively rare in Togo, sometimes occurring in the context of a family history of prostate cancer. Hence the importance of raising awareness among the male population, especially with a family history of prostate cancer, to start screening early, around the age of 40.""","""['Tchin Darré', 'Toukilnan Djiwa', 'Tchilabalo Matchonna Kpatcha', 'Essodina Padja', 'Gado Napo-Koura', 'Tchin Darre']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Epidemiology and histopronostic of prostatic cancer in Togo: about 202 cases diagnosed at the laboratory of pathology of the Tokoin teaching hospital of Lome.', 'Free prostate-specific antigen improves prostate cancer detection in a high-risk population of men with a normal total PSA and digitalrectal examination.', 'Cancers in togo from 1984 to 2008: epidemiological and pathological aspects of 5251 cases.', 'Population screening for prostate cancer and emerging concepts for young men.', 'Prostate Lesions in a Tertiary Institution in North Central Nigeria: A Histopathology Review.']"""

Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is closely associated with ARPI treatment failure and poor prognosis in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, the molecular mechanisms of NED are not fully understood. Here we report that upregulation of TRIM59, a TRIM family protein, is strongly correlated with ARPI treatment mediated NED and shorter patient survival in PCas. AR binds to TRIM59 promoter and represses its transcription. ARPI treatment leads to a reversal of repressive epigenetic modifications on TRIM59 gene and the transcriptional restraint on TRIM59 by AR. Upregulated TRIM59 then drives the NED of PCa by enhancing the degradation of RB1 and P53 and upregulating downstream lineage plasticity-promoting transcription factor SOX2. Altogether, TRIM59 is negatively regulated by AR and acts as a key driver for NED in PCas.

The logarithmic linear regression was used to project the current cancer burden in 2022, and Joinpoint regression was used for temporal trend analysis from 2000 to 2017. We also estimated cancer statistics of older people in the US, Japan and the Republic of Korea for comparisons. It is estimated that 2.79 million cases and 1.94 million deaths occur for Chinese older people, representing 55.8% and 68.2% of cases and deaths in all population in 2022. The overall cancer incidence rate gradually increased among older women, while the mortality rates declined for both sexes. Notably, approximately 10.0% of all cases and 17.7% of all deaths are from people aged over 80 years, and cancer incidence and mortality in this age group showed upward trends for women. Lung cancer and digestive cancers are the leading cancer types for Chinese older people. Compared with other countries, China has lower incidence rates but higher mortality rates for older people. The rapidly growing burden of prostate cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and declines in esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and liver cancer among older people indicate the cancer pattern in China is being in a transition stage to that in developed countries.

We have in an earlier study developed an optimization model that reduces the prevalence of contiguous hot spots by modifying a tentative treatment plan.  Purpose:   The aim of this study is to incorporate the correction of hot spots in a standard inverse planning workflow and to validate the integrated model in a clinical treatment planning system. The spatial function is included in the objective function for the inverse planning, as opposed to in the previous study where it was applied as a separate post-processing step. Our aim is to demonstrate that fine-adjustments of dose distributions, which are often performed manually in today's clinical practice, can be automated.  Methods:   A spatial optimization function was introduced in the treatment planning system RayStation (RaySearch Laboratories AB, Stockholm, Sweden) via a research interface. A series of 10 consecutive prostate patients treated with HDR BT was retrospectively replanned with and without the spatial function.  Results:   Optimization with the spatial function decreased the volume of the largest contiguous hot spot by on average 31%, compared to if the function was not included. The volume receiving at least 200% of the prescription dose decreased by on average 11%. Target coverage, measured as the fractions of the clinical target volume (CTV) and the planning target volume (PTV) receiving at least the prescription dose, was virtually unchanged (less than a percent change for both metrics). Organs-at-risk received comparable or slightly decreased doses if the spatial function was included in the optimization model.

This study aimed to explore the potential causal association between SUA and prostate cancer risk using Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses in the East Asian populations.  Methods:   Publicly available summary-level genome-wide association studies (GWAS) data on SUA were obtained from a genome-wide meta-analysis of three Japanese cohorts (121,745 subjects). The GWAS data on prostate cancer were derived from Biobank Japan (109,347 subjects with 5,408 cases and 103,939 controls). A total of 34 SUA-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (P value < 5 × 10-8) were identified as instrumental variables. The inverse variance weighted method was used as the primary method to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for per standard deviation increase in SUA. MR Egger, weighted median, and weighted mode were also applied to test the robustness of the results.  Results:   Genetically predicted SUA was positively associated with prostate cancer risk using inverse variance weighted (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.00-1.26; P = 0.043). The positive association was robust when MR Egger (OR = 1.16; 95% CI 1.01-1.34; P = 0.048), weighted median (OR = 1.18; 95% CI 1.03-1.36; P = 0.018), and weighted mode (OR = 1.14; 95% CI 1.01-1.29; P = 0.041) were used.

However, many patients may develop abiraterone resistance with a variable duration of response. Hence, identifying a remedy to overcome abiraterone resistance is critical for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In this study, we aim to explore the potential of Qi Ling decoction (QLD), a traditional Chinese medicine, in attenuating abiraterone resistance in prostate cancer. Cell viability and apoptosis were respectively measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry. The protein levels were assessed by Western blotting assay. Autophagosome formation was quantified by counting LC3 puncta. We found that QLD was capable of promoting abiraterone-induced apoptosis and cell death of PC3-AbiR and DU145-AbiR cells in vitro. A combination of QLD and abiraterone yielded a better tumor inhibition effect than QLD alone and abiraterone alone. Further investigation revealed that QLD restored the abiraterone sensitivity of PC3-AbiR and DU145-AbiR cells through modulating autophagy. These findings suggest that QLD might serve as a potential remedy to enhance the therapeutical effect of abiraterone for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Yigeng Feng', 'Hongwen Cao', 'Zixi Song', 'Lei Chen', 'Dan Wang', 'Renjie Gao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Aging (Albany NY)""","""['Inhibition of Autophagy Improves the Efficacy of Abiraterone for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'miR-143 mediates abiraterone acetate resistance by regulating the JNK/Bcl-2 signaling pathway in prostate cancer.', 'KAT2A-mediated AR translocation into nucleus promotes abiraterone-resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone in castration resistant prostate cancer..', 'Abiraterone acetate to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in combination with prednisone.']"""

To propose a new dynamic multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) radiomics method for the detection of prostate cancer (PCa), and establish a combined model using dynamic and static radiomics features based on this method.Approach. A total of 166 patients (82 PCa patients and 84 non-PCa patients) were enrolled in the study, and 31 872 mpMRI images were performed in a radiomics workflow. The whole prostate segmentation and traditional static radiomics features extraction were performed on intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI,bvalue of 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 400, 600, 800, 1000, 1500 s mm-2respectively), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) sequences respectively. Through the building of eachb-value DWI model and the analysis of the static key radiomics features, three types of dynamic features called standard discrete (SD), parameter (P) and relative change rate (RCR) were constructed. And the b-value parameters used to construct dynamic features were divided into three groups ('Df_', 'Db_' and 'Da_'): the front part (10-200 s mm-2), the back part (400-1500 s mm-2), and all (10-1500 s mm-2) of theb-values set, respectively. Afterwards, the dynamic mpMRI model and combined model construction were constructed, and the PCa discrimination performance of each model was evaluated.Main results.The models based on dynamic features showed good potential for PCa identification. Where, the results of Db_SD, Da_P and Db_P models were encouraging (test cohort AUCs: 90.78%, 87.60%, 86.3%), which was better than the commonly used ADC model (AUC of ADC was 75.48%). Among the combined models, the models using static features of T2WI and dynamic features performed the best. The AUC of Db_SD + T2WI, Db_P + T2WI and Db_RCR + T2WI model was 92.90%, 91.29% and 81.46%.Significance.The dynamic-static combination model based on dynamic mpMRI radiomics method has a good effect on the identification of PCa. This method has broad application prospects in PCa individual diagnosis management.""","""['Shuqin Li', 'Tingting Zheng', 'Zhou Fan', 'Hui Qu', 'Jianfeng Wang', 'Jianbin Bi', 'Qingjie Lv', 'Gejun Zhang', 'Xiaoyu Cui', 'Yue Zhao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Multiparametric MRI and auto-fixed volume of interest-based radiomics signature for clinically significant peripheral zone prostate cancer.', 'Advanced zoomed diffusion-weighted imaging vs. full-field-of-view diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer detection: a radiomic features study.', 'MRI-based radiomics models to assess prostate cancer, extracapsular extension and positive surgical margins.', 'Multiparametric MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: Physical Foundations, Limitations, and Prospective Advances of\xa0Diffusion-Weighted MRI.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for transition zone prostate cancer: essential findings, limitations, and future directions.', 'Dynamic radiomics for predicting the efficacy of antiangiogenic therapy in colorectal liver metastases.']"""

The SOX family transcription factor SOX9, as well as the transcription co-activator HMGB3 of the HMGB family, are also overexpressed and may play pivotal roles in PCa. However, it is unknown whether SOX9 and HMGB3 interact with each other, or if they regulate NANOG gene transcription.  Methods:   We identified potential SOX9 responsive elements in NANOG promoter, and investigated if SOX9 regulated NANOG transcription in co-operation with HMGB3 by experimental analysis of potential SOX9 binding sites in NANOG promoter, reporter gene transcription assays with or without interference or artificial overexpression of SOX9 and/or HMGB3, and protein-binding assays of SOX9-HMGB3 interaction. Clinicopathologic and prognostic significance of SOX9-HMGB3 overexpression in PCa was analyzed.  Results:   SOX9 activated NANOG gene transcription by preferentially binding to a highly conserved consensus cis-regulatory element (-573 to -568) in NANOG promoter, and promoted the expression of NANOG downstream oncogenic genes. Importantly, HMGB3 functioned as a partner of SOX9 to co-operatively enhance transactivation of NANOG by interacting with SOX9, predominantly via the HMG Box A domain of HMGB3. Overexpression of SOX9 and/or HMGB3 enhanced PCa cell survival and cell migration and were significantly associated with PCa progression. Notably, Cox proportional regression analysis showed that co-overexpression of both SOX9 and HMGB3 was an independent unfavorable prognosticator for both CRPC-free survival (relative risk [RR] = 3.779，95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.159-12.322, p = 0.028) and overall survival (RR = 3.615，95% CI: 1.101-11.876, p = 0.034).

To make up for this lacuna, we aimed to develop a comorbidity score for cancer patients, based on the Lombardy Region healthcare databases.  Methods:   We used hospital discharge records to identify patients with a new diagnosis of solid cancer between February and December 2019; 61 comorbidities were retrieved within 2 years before cancer diagnosis. This cohort was split into training and validation sets. In the training set, we used a LASSO-logistic model to identify comorbidities associated with the risk of developing a severe/fatal form of COVID-19 during the first pandemic wave (March-May 2020). We used a logistic model to estimate comorbidity score weights and then we divided the score into five classes (<=-1, 0, 1, 2-4, >=5). In the validation set, we assessed score performance by areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration plots. We repeated the process on second pandemic wave (October-December 2020) data.  Results:   We identified 55,425 patients with an incident solid cancer. We selected 21 comorbidities as independent predictors. The first four score classes showed similar probability of experiencing the outcome (0.2% to 0.5%), while the last showed a probability equal to 5.8%. The score performed well in both the first and second pandemic waves: AUC 0.85 and 0.82, respectively. Our results were robust for major cancer sites too (i.e., colorectal, lung, female breast, and prostate).  Conclusions:   We developed a high performance comorbidity score for cancer patients and COVID-19.

Patients were followed for 2 years to determine whether they became potentially eligible for an available therapeutic trial. Potentially eligible patients were randomized to receive a trials-focused Question Prompt List or usual care. Patient-physician interactions were video-recorded. Outcomes included communication quality and trial invitation rates. Descriptive analyses assessed associations between sociodemographic characteristics and eligibility and effects of the intervention on outcomes.  Results:   Only 44 (22.1%) of participating patients (n = 199) became potentially eligible for an available clinical trial.

The inability to distinguish iUC involving the prostate from PCA results in indiscriminate clinical management strategies that could be suboptimal as first-line chemotherapy for iUC (cisplatin) and PCA (docetaxel) differ in people. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane protein, and its overexpression has been identified in human prostate carcinoma and neovasculature associated with solid tumor growth. This study investigates whether differential PSMA expression exists between presumptive canine iUC and PCA among cell lines and archived patient samples, which might allow for improved accuracy in disease-based stratification and optimal chemotherapy selection. Additionally, in vitro sensitivities of reported canine iUC and PCA cell lines to uroepithelial directed chemotherapeutic agents were characterized.  Results:   Normalized PSMA gene and protein expressions were not significantly different between 5 iUC and 4 PCA cell lines. PSMA protein expression was uniformly observed in uroepithelial cancers regardless of anatomic origin from archived patient samples, further confirming that PSMA cannot differentiate iUC from PCA. In vitro sensitivity of cell lines to uroepithelial directed chemotherapeutics revealed that vinblastine exerted the broadest cytotoxic activity.  Conclusions:   Differential expression of PSMA was not identified between canine iUC and PCA cell lines or archived patient samples, and PSMA alone cannot be used for disease stratification. Nonetheless given its conserved overexpression, PSMA may be a targetable surface marker for both canine iUC and PCA.

However, limited information is available on the impact of prior treatment duration and class on survival outcome for novel therapies, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) for patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+ HER2-) MBC.  Methods:   This study used a nationwide, de-identified electronic health record-derived database to identify women with HR+ HER2- MBC who received at least one CDK 4/6i between 2011 and 2020. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for the association between prior duration and class of cancer treatment (both early-stage and metastatic) and prior CDK 4/6i survival as well as for those with multiple CDK 4/6i.  Results:   Of 5363 patients, the median survival from first CDK 4/6 inhibitor administration was 3.3 years. When compared to patients with no prior treatments, patients with < 1 year of prior treatment duration had a 30% increased hazard of death (HR, 1.30; 95% CI 1.15-1.46), those with 1 to < 3 years a 68% increased hazard of death (HR 1.68; 95% CI 1.49-1.88), and those with 3 or more years a 55% increased hazard of death (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.36, 1.76). Patients who received prior therapy (endocrine or chemotherapy) before their CDK 4/6i had worse outcomes than those who received no prior therapy. Similar results were seen when comparing patients in the metastatic setting alone. Finally, patients who received a different CDK 4/6i after their first saw a lower hazard of death compared to patients who received subsequent endocrine or chemotherapy after their first CDK 4/6i.  Conclusion:   Prior treatment duration and class are associated with a decreased overall survival after CDK 4/6 inhibitor administration.

Cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and radioresistance were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, flow cytometry, transwell invasion, and colony formation assays. Tumor xenograft experiment was conducted to assess circ-ABCC4 role in xenograft growth in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was implemented to test the target relation of microRNA-1253 (miR-1253) and circ-ABCC4 or SRY-box transcription factor 4 (SOX4). Circ-ABCC4 enrichment was prominently raised in PCa tissue specimens and cells. Circ-ABCC4 depletion blocked PCa cell viability, proliferation, invasion, and radioresistance and triggered apoptosis. Circ-ABCC4 silencing aggravated irradiation-induced inhibitory effect on xenografts growth. miR-1253 was a downstream molecule of circ-ABCC4, and circ-ABCC4 depletion-mediated anti-cancer impacts in PCa cells were partly counteracted by decreasing miR-1253 abundance. miR-1253 targeted SOX4 mRNA, and miR-1253 blocked PCa cell malignant phenotypes partly by targeting SOX4. Circ-ABCC4 could enhance SOX4 abundance by absorbing miR-1253.

To also evaluate the association between the quantified tumor volume and the prognosis of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Methods:   This prospective analysis included patients diagnosed with metastatic hormone-sensitive or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer between 2017 and 2022. We developed an imaging software (Attractive BD_Score) that analyzed whole-body diffusion-weighted and in-phase and opposed-phase T1-weighted images to automatically exclude the red bone marrow. The quantified tumor volume was compared with that quantified by traditional whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging without red bone marrow exclusion. Prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival, time-to-pain progression, and overall survival were evaluated to assess the prognostic value of the quantified tumor volume.  Results:   The quantified tumor volume was significantly smaller than that quantified by the traditional method in metastatic hormone-sensitive (median: 81.0 ml vs. 149.4 ml) and metastatic castration-resistant (median: 29.4 ml vs. 63.5 ml) prostate cancer. A highly quantified tumor volume was associated with prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (p = 0.030), time-to-pain progression (p = 0.003), and overall survival (p = 0.005) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and with poor prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival (p = 0.001) and time-to-pain progression (p = 0.005) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The aim of this study is to perform a dosimetric comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of SBRT treatments for localized prostate cancer delivered by CyberKnife (CK) and Varian Truebeam STX (FF and FFF). Seventeen intermediate and high-risk patients with localized prostate cancer were included in the study. SBRT plans for the CK system and Varian Truebeam STX systems with and without Flattening Filters (Tru-FF and Tru-FFF) were prepared for each patient. Plans prepared for each patient were planned at a fraction dose of 6.7 Gy at 6 MV energy and a target dose of 33.5 Gy in 5 fractions. For all plans, cumulative dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were generated for target volumes and organs at risk (OAR). The maximum doses of PTV (41 Gy) in CK plans are higher than the maximum doses (35 Gy) in VMAT plans prepared with Tru-FF or Tru-FFF beams. The mean dose of the rectal wall (10.06 ± 2.40Gy for CK) is still relatively low compared to other plans (13.46 ± 2.16 Gy for Tru-FF and 13.61 ± 2.32 Gy for Tru-FFF). The bladder wall (14 Gy for CK, 26 Gy for Tru-FF and Tru-FFF) and femoral head (6.8 Gy for CK, 9 Gy for Tru-FF and 9.4 Gy Tru-FFF) doses were also lower for CK plans. The CK plans provide better tumour control due to low doses in critical organs and high target doses than the Tru-FF or Tru-FFF plans. It was observed that CK and VMAT plans for SBRT with 6 MV photon beams provided acceptable results in term of treatment planning criteria such as Conformity Index and Homogeneity Index. It is recommended to use a target tracking system to provide an accurate and reliable SBRT treatment with VMAT and CK techniques.""","""['Ahmet Murat Şenişik', 'Murat Okutan', 'Aydın Çakir', 'Ayça Iribaş Çelik', 'Esra Kaytan Sağlam', 'Görkem Çevikbaş', 'Bayram Demir']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Appl Radiat Isot""","""['Comparison of VMAT-SABR treatment plans with flattening filter (FF) and flattening filter-free (FFF) beam for localized prostate cancer.', 'Single-fraction flattening filter-free volumetric modulated arc therapy for lung cancer: Dosimetric results and comparison with flattened beams technique.', 'FFF-VMAT for SBRT of lung lesions: Improves dose coverage at tumor-lung interface compared to flattened beams.', 'Assessment of HDR brachytherapy-replicating prostate radiotherapy planning for tomotherapy, cyberknife and VMAT.', 'Novel strategy with the automatic non-coplanar volumetric-modulated arc therapy for angiosarcoma of the scalp.']"""

The aim of the present anatomical study was to describe the topographic anatomy of these compartments and define relevant landmarks and surgical dissection planes.  Background:   Pelvic anatomy as it relates to exenterative surgery is complex. Demonstration of the topographic peculiarities of the pelvis based on the operative situs is hindered by the inaccessibility of the small pelvis and the tumor bulk itself.  Materials and methods:   Thirteen formalin-fixed pelvic specimens were meticulously dissected according to predefined pelvic compartments. Pelvic exenteration was simulated and illustrated in a stepwise manner. Different access routes were used for optimal demonstration of the regions of interest.  Results:   All the 7 compartments (peritoneal reflection, anterior above peritoneal reflection, anterior below peritoneal reflection, central, posterior, lateral, inferior) were investigated systematically. The topography of the pelvic fasciae and ligaments; vessels and nerves of the bladder, prostate, uterus, and vagina; the internal iliac artery and vein; the course of the ureter, somatic (obturator nerve, sacral plexus), and autonomic pelvic nerves (inferior hypogastric plexus); pelvic sidewall and floor, ischioanal fossa; and relevant structures for sacrectomy were demonstrated.  Conclusions:   A systematic approach to pelvic anatomy according to the 7 magnetic resonance imaging-defined compartments clearly revealed crucial anatomical landmarks and key structures facilitating pelvic exenterative surgery.

Methods:   A total of 67 consecutive patients with cT1c-4N1M0 prostate cancer were definitively treated by WP SIB-IMRT. Neoadjuvant ADT (median: 8.3 months) was administered in all cases. WP SIB-IMRT was designed to simultaneously deliver 78, 66.3, and 58.5 Gy in 39 fractions to the prostate plus seminal vesicles, metastatic lymph nodes (LNs), and the pelvic LN region, respectively.

Methods:   Eighty men were consecutively submitted to robot-assisted simple prostatectomy in our institution from October 2019 to October 2020. All procedures were performed by the same surgical team. Diagnostic preoperative assessment was based on history, symptoms evaluation by International Prostate Symptom Score, digital rectal examination, flowmetry with post-void residual volume measurement by abdominal ultrasound, prostatic volume estimation by MRI, PSA dosage. Under combined general and subarachnoid anesthesia, surgery was performed via a transperitoneal approach using a Da Vinci Si system in the four-arm configuration. Operative time, blood loss, hospital stay, catheterization time, intraoperative and postoperative complications were assessed. Clinical postoperative 6 months of evaluation was based on physical examination, flowmetry with post-void residual volume measurement, PSA dosage, and International Prostate Symptom Score.  Results:   Mean operative time was 105.29 min, mean hospital staying 5.4 days. Blood loss was low in all cases and only 2 patients received transfusion. Catheterization time was 7 days. According to the Clavien-Dindo classification, only minor (grade I and grade II) intraoperative and postoperative complications were observed. At 6-month postoperative assessment, a statistically significant increase of urinary flow indexes and bladder capacity was recorded, as a significant reduction of urinary residual volume. No patient experienced stress urinary incontinence and the mean postoperative IPSS score was significantly reduced to 4.3. Two patients were diagnosed with incidental prostatic cancer at the histopathological examination.  Conclusions:   Data collected in our experience on a large cohort confirm efficacy and safety of Robot-Assisted Simple Prostatectomy. This procedure allows both short operative time and hospital staying, with low incidence of perioperative complications.

It exhibits anti-tumor effects, including angiogenesis and suppression of cell cycle progression. Moreover, progressively reducing expression levels of vitamin D receptor (VDR) are observed in many cancer types, including the prostate. In the present study, we investigated the molecular action of 1,25(OH)2 D3 on ERAD, UPR and androgenic signaling. We found that 1,25(OH)2 D3 negatively regulated the expression level of ERAD components and divergently controlled the inositol-requiring enzyme 1⍺ (IRE1⍺) and protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase (PERK) branches of UPR in LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Also, similar results were obtained with another human prostate cancer cell line, 22Rv1. More strikingly, we found that androgenic signaling is negatively regulated by VDR signaling. Also, molecular docking supported the inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2 D3 on AR signaling. Moreover, we found VDR signaling suppressed tumor progression by decreasing c-Myc expression and reducing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, 1,25(OH)2 D3 treatment significantly inhibited the 3D-tumor formation of LNCaP cells. Our results suggest that further molecular characterization of the action of VDR signaling in other cancer types such as estrogenic signal in breast cancer will provide important contributions to a better understanding of the roles of steroid hormone receptors in carcinogenesis processes.""","""['Yalcin Erzurumlu', 'Esra Aydogdu', 'Hatice Kubra Dogan', 'Deniz Catakli', 'Muhammed Tilahun Muhammed', 'Buket Buyuksandic']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Progesterone regulates the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and Unfolded Protein Response axis by mimicking the androgenic stimulation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor signaling and vitamin D receptor action in prostate cancer cells.', 'Estrogens drive the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and promote proto-oncogene c-Myc expression in prostate cancer cells\xa0by androgen receptor/estrogen receptor signaling.', 'Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer.', 'Vitamin D and systemic cancer: is this relevant to malignant melanoma?', 'The impact of vitamin D on cancer: A mini review.']"""

Methods and materials:   A total of 117 patients with low- to intermediate-risk, clinical T1a-T2c prostate adenocarcinoma were enrolled in a single-institution, prospective, single-blind, phase 3 randomized trial. All received definitive IMRT to 74 to 80 Gy in 37 to 40 fractions and standard IMRT (s-IMRT) or erectile tissue-sparing IMRT (ETS-IMRT), which placed additional planning constraints that limited the D90 to the penile bulb and corporal bodies to ≤15 Gy and ≤7 Gy, respectively. Erectile potency was assessed with components of the International Index of Erectile Function and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5) medication records.  Results:   Sixty-two patients received ETS-IMRT, and 54 received s-IMRT; 1 patient did not receive radiation therapy. Before treatment, all patients reported erectile potency. No patients received androgen deprivation therapy. In the intention-to-treat analysis, treatment arms did not differ in potency preservation at 24 months (37.1% ETS-IMRT vs 31.5% s-IMRT, P = .53). Of 85 evaluable patients with International Index of Erectile Function and PDE5 medication follow-up, erectile potency was seen in 47.9% of patients in the ETS-IMRT arm and 46.0% of patients in the s-IMRT arm (P = .86). PDE5 inhibitors were initiated in 41.7% of ETS-IMRT patients and 35.1% of s-IMRT patients (P = .54). Among all patients enrolled, there was no difference in freedom from biochemical failure between those treated with ETS-IMRT and s-IMRT (5-year 91.8% vs 90.7%, respectively, P = .77), with a median follow-up of 7.4 years. There were no differences in acute or late gastrointestinal or genitourinary toxicity. An unplanned per-protocol analysis demonstrated no differences in potency preservation or secondary endpoints between patients who exceeded erectile tissue-sparing constraints and those who met constraints, although power was limited by attrition and unplanned dosimetric crossover.

However, between 1967 and 2021, reports of ectopic prostatic tissue in the medical literature increased. It is rarely reported that ectopic prostatic tissue can be misdiagnosed as a nephrogenic adenoma (NA). This case study aimed to increase the awareness of ectopic prostatic tissue to improve its rates of diagnosis. This paper is focused on a 45-year-old male patient with a history of bladder lesions that were accidentally discovered through a health examination. A computed tomography scan revealed a homogeneous isoechoic mass in the posterior inferior wall of the bladder. At first, a transurethral cystoscopy revealed a smooth sessile mass covering the normal bladder mucosa, which was located in the middle of the interureteric ridge. The biopsy results suggested a possible intravesical NA. The mass was then completely resected under pneumovesicoscopy, and the pathological diagnosis was ectopic prostatic tissue. The clinical symptoms of ectopic prostatic tissue are similar to other bladder neoplasms, but there are too few characteristics available in imaging examinations to allow for an accurate diagnosis. Since ectopic prostatic tissue can present as a tumor in the bladder, urologists may easily misdiagnose the condition.

Methods:   Bioinformatics methods were employed to analyze AJAP1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and its association with TNM staging. MSP and qRT-PCR were used to quantify promoter methylation and AJAP1 expression after 5-aza-20-deoxycytidine (5-AzaC) treatment. Scratch healing assay and Transwell method were adopted to analyze the effects of aberrant AJAP1 expression, 5-AzaC and AG490 on cell migration and invasion. The levels of AJAP1 protein, EMT-related and JAK/STAT pathway-related proteins were determined by Western blot. The effects of AJAP1 aberrant expression and AG490 treatment on the sphere forming ability of prostate cancer cells were analyzed by sphere formation assay.  Results:   This study confirmed the significant down-regulation of AJAP1 expression in prostate cancer tissues and cells, and its negative correlation with TNM staging. 5-AzaC treatment led to a significant reduction of AJAP1 methylation level and a significant upregulation of AJAP1 expression, indicating that the methylation level of AJAP1 promoter may affect the expression of AJAP1. Cell function experiments found that overexpression or decreased methylation of AJAP1 inhibited epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion, while silencing or increased methylation of AJAP1 had the opposite functions. JAK2/STAT3 pathway inhibiting assay found that inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 pathway significantly reduced EMT, cell migration, and stem cell sphere formation in prostate cancer.

Objective:   To comprehensively examine disparities and trends in the incidence and mortality for the four major genitourinary cancers (bladder, kidney, prostate, and testis) in the USA.  Design, setting, and participants:   We obtained incidence data from the National Cancer Institute 22-registry Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database and the US Cancer Statistics database (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics to examine cross-sectional and temporal trends in incidence and death rates stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and county.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Age-adjusted incidence and death rates were calculated using SEER*Stat software. Temporal trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression for a two-sided significance level of p < 0.05.  Results and limitations:   Incidence and mortality rates for bladder and kidney cancers were two to four times higher for men than for women. Among non-Hispanic White individuals, the highest incidence rates were found in the Northeast for bladder cancer and in Appalachia for kidney cancer, whereas the highest death rates for prostate cancer were found in the West. Incidence rates increased for cancers of the kidney and testis and for advanced-stage prostate cancer in almost all racial/ethnic populations and for bladder cancer in the American Indian/Alaska Native population. Death rates increased for testicular cancer in the Hispanic population and stabilized for prostate cancer among White and Asian American/Pacific Islander men after a steady decline since the early 1990s. Study limitations include misclassification of race/ethnicity on medical records and death certificates.  Conclusions:   We found persistent sociodemographic disparities and unfavorable trends in incidence or mortality for all four major genitourinary cancers. Future studies should elucidate the reasons for these patterns.

Immunotherapies such as chimeric antigen receptor, T-cell therapy and immune checkpoint blockade have exerted promising antitumor effects in hematological and solid tumor malignancies; however, no encouraging responses have been observed against mCRPC. The deubiquitinase USP13 functions as a tumor suppressor in many human cancers, as it sustains the protein stability of PTEN and TP53; however, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) and involvement in DNA damage and AR signaling remain unclear. In the current study, we explored the prognostic value of USP13 in PCa based on the TCGA database, and we analyzed the expression of USP13 in PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues based on TCGA and our cohort. The results suggested that USP13 is overexpressed in PCa tumors and has the potential to be an independent biomarker for the overall survival of PCa patients. Additionally, enrichment analysis indicated that USP13 may participate in the AR pathway and PI3k/Wnt signaling, which are closely related to PCa progression. We also observed a significant correlation between the expression of USP13 and AR-related genes, DDR genes and mismatch repair genes based on the TCGA_PRAD dataset, which further supported the critical role of USP13 in AR activation and the DNA damage response of PCa. USP13 was also found to be enriched in protein neddylation, and expression of USP13 was significantly associated with infiltration of immune cells and expression of immunomodulators. Taken together, our study revealed a key role of USP13 in contributing to PCa progression by participating in multiple oncogenic signaling pathways, the DNA damage response and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Targeting USP13 may inhibit tumor growth and provide additional benefits in cooperation with DDR inhibitors and immunotherapy.""","""['Xiaolu Cui', 'Hongyuan Yu', 'Jinlong Yao', 'Jinling Li', 'Zhenhua Li', 'Zhenming Jiang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Identification of LAT/ZAP70 characterized immune subtypes of prostate cancer.', 'Selective targeting of PARP-2 inhibits androgen receptor signaling and prostate cancer growth through disruption of FOXA1 function.', 'MAPK4 promotes prostate cancer by concerted activation of androgen receptor and AKT.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor (AR) heterogeneity in prostate cancer and therapy resistance.', 'Investigation of fatty acid metabolism-related genes in breast cancer: Implications for Immunotherapy and clinical significance.']"""

The purpose of this study was to determine if an increase in the vascular hydrostatic gradient via 70° HUT increases tumor perfusion and decreases tumor hypoxia in a preclinical orthotopic model of prostate cancer. Male Copenhagen rats (n = 17) were orthotopically injected with Dunning R-3327 (AT-1) prostate adenocarcinoma cells to induce prostate tumors. After tumors were established, prostate tumor perfusion and hypoxia were measured in rats during level (0°) and 70° HUT positions. To compare the magnitude of the hydrostatic column to that present in humans, ultrasound was used to measure the heart to prostate distance in male human subjects to estimate the prostate vascular hydrostatic pressure with the upright posture. In young rats, no differences were detected in prostate tumor perfusion or prostate tumor hypoxia with 70° HUT versus the level position. However, from the retrospective study, young rats increased prostate vascular resistance to HUT, whereas aged rats lacked this response. Tumor vessels co-opted from existing functional vasculature in young rats may be sufficient to negate increases in perfusion pressure with HUT seen in aged rats. Additionally, in humans, the estimated hydrostatic column at the level of the prostate is five times greater than that of the rat. Therefore, 70° HUT may elicit increases in prostate/prostate tumor blood flow in humans that is not seen in rats.""","""['Olivia N Kunkel', 'Taylor A Rand', 'Joseph G Pyle', 'Dryden R Baumfalk', 'Andrew G Horn', 'Alexander B Opoku-Acheampong', 'Carl J Ade', 'Timothy I Musch', 'Michael W Ramsey', 'Michael D Delp', 'Bradley J Behnke']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Physiol Rep""","""['Modulation of blood flow, hypoxia, and vascular function in orthotopic prostate tumors during exercise.', 'Changes in blood pressure, blood flow towards the head and heart rate during 90\xa0deg head-up tilting for 30\xa0min in anaesthetized male rats.', 'Gravitational effects on intraocular pressure and ocular perfusion pressure.', 'Vascular conductance and muscle blood flow during exercise are altered by inspired oxygen fraction and arterial perfusion pressure.', 'Vestibular system plays a significant role in arterial pressure control during head-up tilt in young subjects.']"""

Similarly, mice with inactivating Ghr mutations are protected from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia in the C3(1)/TAg prostate cancer model. However, gaps in clinical relevance in those models persist. The current study addresses these gaps and the ongoing role of Ghr in prostate cancer using loss-of-function and gain-of-function models.  Methods:   Conditional Ghr inactivation was achieved in the C3(1)/TAg model by employing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre and a prostate-specific Cre. In parallel, a transgenic GH antagonist was also used. Pathology, proliferation, and gene expression of 6-month old mouse prostates were assessed. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data was conducted to identify GHR overexpression in a subset of human prostate cancers. Ghr overexpression was modeled in PTEN-P2 and TRAMP-C2 mouse prostate cancer cells using stable transfectants. The growth, proliferation, and gene expression effects of Ghr overexpression was assessed in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   Loss-of-function for Ghr globally or in prostatic epithelial cells reduced proliferation and stratification of the prostatic epithelium in the C3(1)/TAg model. Genes and gene sets involved in the immune system and tumorigenesis, for example, were dysregulated upon global Ghr disruption. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed higher GHR expression in human prostate cancers with ERG-fusion genes or ETV1-fusion genes. Modeling the GHR overexpression observed in these human prostate cancers by overexpressing Ghr in mouse prostate cancer cells with mutant Pten or T-antigen driver genes increased proliferation of prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.

Consistently, androgen-depletion or AR-pathway inhibitors (ARIs) de-repressed IL-1β in ARPOS cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. The AR transcriptional repression is sustained by histone de-acetylation at the H3K27 mark in the IL-1β promoter. Notably, patients' data suggest that DNA methylation prevents IL-1β expression, even if the AR-signaling axis is inactive. Our previous studies show that secreted IL-1β supports metastatic progression in mice by altering the transcriptome of tumor-associated bone stroma.

Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-enabled deep learning (DL) models have been used to support medical diagnostics in real time, thus resolving the issue of late-stage diagnosis of various diseases and increasing performance accuracy. The current approach for the diagnosis of leukemia uses traditional procedures, and in most cases, fails in the initial period. Hence, several patients suffering from cancer have died prematurely due to the late discovery of cancerous cells in blood tissue. Therefore, this study proposes an IoMT-enabled convolutional neural network (CNN) model to detect malignant and benign cancer cells in the patient's blood tissue. In particular, the hyper-parameter optimization through radial basis function and dynamic coordinate search (HORD) optimization algorithm was used to search for optimal values of CNN hyper-parameters. Utilizing the HORD algorithm significantly increased the effectiveness of finding the best solution for the CNN model by searching multidimensional hyper-parameters. This implies that the HORD method successfully found the values of hyper-parameters for precise leukemia features. Additionally, the HORD method increased the performance of the model by optimizing and searching for the best set of hyper-parameters for the CNN model. Leukemia datasets were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model using standard performance indicators.

Our objectives were to provide the mechanistic assessment of guava leaf extract on gene expressions related to the androgen pathway in well-known in vitro models, hair follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPC), and human prostate cancer cells (DU-145), and to determine its bioactive constituents and antioxidant activities. LC-MS analysis demonstrated that the main components of the ethanolic extract of guava leaves are phenolic substances, specifically catechin, gallic acid, and quercetin, which contribute to its scavenging and metal chelating abilities. The guava leaf extract substantially downregulated SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3 genes in the DU-145 model, suggesting that the extract could minimize hair loss by inhibiting the synthesis of a potent androgen (dihydrotestosterone). SRD5A suppression by gallic acid and quercetin was verified. Our study reveals new perspectives on guava leaf extract's anti-androgen properties.

The median age of the patients was 69 years, and the initial PSA level was 20.5 (IQR 10.8-31.6) ng/mL. The median operative time was 205 (IQR 182-241) minutes. Sixty-six patients (86.8%) regained continence within 1 year, and the continence rate within 3 years of follow-up was 90.8% (69 patients). The overall survival rate was 100%. Twenty-two patients had BCR, of whom 13 received salvage androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), 2 received salvage external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) alone, and 7 received combined ADT and EBRT.

The samples underwent DNA and RNA sequencing at a CLIA/CAP-certified clinical lab. Reversion mutations were called only in patients whose available clinical records showed the use of PARP inhibitors or platinum agents prior to tumor profiling. Results: Reversion mutations were identified in 75 of 247,926 samples profiled across all tumor types. Among patients carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations, reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were seen in ovarian cancer (OC) (30/3424), breast cancer (BC) (27/1460), endometrial cancer (4/564), pancreatic cancer (2/340), cholangiocarcinoma (2/178), prostate cancer (5/461), cervical cancer (1/117), cancer of unknown primary (1/244), bladder cancer (1/300), malignant pleural mesothelioma (1/10), and a neuroendocrine tumor of the prostate. We identified 22 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 8 in BRCA2 in OC. In BC, we detected 6 reversion mutations in BRCA1 and 21 in BRCA2. We compared molecular profile results of 14 high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSOC) with reversion mutations against 87 control HGSOC with pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations without reversion mutations. Tumors with reversion mutations trended to have had lower ER expression (25% vs. 64%, p = 0.024, q = 0.82) and higher KDM6A mutation rate (15% vs. 0, p = 0.016, q = 0.82). Conclusions: We present one of the largest datasets reporting reversion mutations in BRCA1/2 genes across various tumor types. These reversion mutations were rare; this may be because some patients may not have had repeat profiling post-treatment. Repeat tumor profiling at times of treatment resistance can help inform therapy selection in the refractory disease setting.""","""['Sourat Darabi', 'David R Braxton', 'Joanne Xiu', 'Benedito A Carneiro', 'Jeff Swensen', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis', 'Stephen V Liu', 'Rana R McKay', 'David Spetzler', 'Wafik S El-Deiry', 'Michael J Demeure']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Diverse BRCA1 and BRCA2 Reversion Mutations in Circulating Cell-Free DNA of Therapy-Resistant Breast or Ovarian Cancer.', 'Reversion and non-reversion mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitor or platinum chemotherapy in BRCA1/2-mutant metastatic breast cancer.', 'Polyclonal BRCA2 mutations following carboplatin treatment confer resistance to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in a patient with mCRPC: a case report.', 'PARP Inhibitors and the Evolving Landscape of Ovarian Cancer Management: A Review.', 'Chemotherapy for Patients with BRCA1 and BRCA2-Mutated Ovarian Cancer: Same or Different?', 'Update on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors resistance in ovarian cancer.']"""

For the preparation of stable, biocompatible, and small-sized compacted Au@16-Ph-16/DNA-Doxo nanotransporters, the conditions for the DNA-Doxo compaction process induced by gold nanoparticles were first explored using fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy techniques. The reverse process, which is fundamental for Doxo liberation at the site of action, was found to occur at higher CAu@16-Ph-16 concentrations using these techniques. Zeta potential, dynamic light scattering and UV-visible spectroscopy reveal that the prepared compacted nanosystems are stable, highly charged and of adequate size for the effective delivery of Doxo to the cell. This fact is verified by in vitro biocompatibility and internalization studies using two prostate cancer-derived cell lines (LNCaP and DU145) and one hepatocellular carcinoma-derived cell line (SNU-387), as well as a non-tumor prostate (PNT2) cell line and a non-hepatocarcinoma hepatoblastoma cell line (Hep-G2) model used as a control in liver cells. However, the most outstanding results of this work are derived from the use of the CI+NI combined treatments which present strong action in cancer-derived cell lines, while a protective effect is observed in non-tumor cell lines. Hence, novel therapeutic targets based on gold nanoparticles denote high selectivity compared to conventional treatment based on free Doxo at the same concentration.

This study aims to research the course of surgical treatment in urology during the pandemic in 2020, evaluate the volume of deferred treatment in urology in Poland, and indicate groups of patients that are especially vulnerable to a delay in the delivery of healthcare services. The National Health Found statistics (NHF) database was searched for information on procedures completed in urology departments from 2015 to 2020. Changes in hospital discharges of adults from 2019 to 2021 were investigated using monthly reports of NHF on patient billing groups. Statistics of PSA, testosterone, and creatinine testing were extracted from NHF reports. Annual changes in the number of surgeries were calculated. Then, the estimation of the expected quantity of procedures without the occurrence of the pandemic was performed using linear regression based on data from 2015 to 2020. The estimation was assumed reliable at R2 > 0.8. The difference between collected and estimated data was analysed. In 2020, the volume of radical prostatectomies, cystectomies, and kidney surgeries noted downturns following lockdowns in March and November. All analysed procedures, except radical cystectomy, noted a reduction in the entire year. The declines reached -34% in shockwave lithotripsy, -13% in ureterorenoscopic lithotripsy, -22% in cystolithotripsy, -28% in percutaneous lithotripsy, -12% in transurethral resection of a bladder tumour (TURBT), -31% in transurethral resection of the prostate, -15% in nephrectomy and kidney tumorectomy, and -10% in radical prostatectomy. Among the analysed procedures, only radical cystectomy rates increased 5%. Prostate-specific antigen and creatinine tests fell -17%, and testosterone testing was down -18%. In conclusion, the patients most vulnerable to delayed treatment due to the post-pandemic backlog are those requiring TURBT, kidney cancer operations, and radical prostatectomies. Solving backlogs in urology should prioritise cancer patients and thus requires improved access to cystoscopy, TURBT, diagnoses and surgery of prostate and kidney tumours.

However, extracting meaningful information from large datasets for comprehensive understanding of cell phenotypes and disease pathophysiology remains a major challenge. Despite tremendous advances in understanding molecular mechanisms of cancer and its progression, current knowledge appears discrete and fragmented. In order to render this wealth of data more integrated and thus informative, we have developed a GECIP toolbox to investigate the crosstalk and the responsible genes'/proteins' connectivity of enriched pathways from gene expression data. To implement this toolbox, we used mainly gene expression datasets of prostate cancer, and the three datasets were GSE17951, GSE8218, and GSE1431. The raw samples were processed for normalization, prediction of differentially expressed genes, and the prediction of enriched pathways for the differentially expressed genes. The enriched pathways have been processed for crosstalk degree calculations for which number connections per gene, the frequency of genes in the pathways, sharing frequency, and the connectivity have been used. For network prediction, protein-protein interaction network database FunCoup2.0 was used, and cytoscape software was used for the network visualization. In our results, we found that there were enriched pathways 27, 45, and 22 for GSE17951, GSE8218, and GSE1431, respectively, and 11 pathways in common between all of them. From the crosstalk results, we observe that focal adhesion and PI3K pathways, both experimentally proven central for cellular output upon perturbation of numerous individual/distinct signaling pathways, displayed highest crosstalk degree. Moreover, we also observe that there were more critical pathways which appear to be highly significant, and these pathways are HIF1a, hippo, AMPK, and Ras. In terms of the pathways' components, GSK3B, YWHAE, HIF1A, ATP1A3, and PRKCA are shared between the aforementioned pathways and have higher connectivity with the pathways and the other pathway components. Finally, we conclude that the focal adhesion and PI3K pathways are the most critical pathways, and since for many other pathways, high-rank enrichment did not translate to high crosstalk degree, the global impact of one pathway on others appears distinct from enrichment.""","""['Mohammad Mobashir', 'S Pauliina Turunen', 'Mohammad Asrar Izhari', 'Ibraheem Mohammed Ashankyty', 'Thomas Helleday', 'Kaisa Lehti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Network analysis of an in vitro model of androgen-resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of key genes and pathways in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Derivation and Validation of the Potential Core Genes in Pancreatic Cancer for Tumor-Stroma Crosstalk.', 'Pathway crosstalk analysis in prostate cancer based on protein-protein network data.', 'Screening of hub genes and evaluation of the growth regulatory role of CD44 in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Role of ZNF143 and Its Association with Gene Expression Patterns, Noncoding Mutations, and the Immune System in Human Breast Cancer.']"""

Anticancer treatments induce cellular senescence (therapy-induced senescence, TIS) in both tumor and non-cancerous cells, contributing to many detrimental side effects of therapies. Thus, we focused on the effects of chemotherapy on the stromal compartment of prostate and ovarian cancer. We demonstrated that anticancer chemotherapeutics, regardless of their specific mechanism of action, promote a senescent phenotype in stromal fibroblasts, resulting in metabolic alterations and secretion of paracrine factors, sustaining the invasive and clonogenic potential of both prostate and ovarian cancer cells. The clearance of senescent stromal cells, through senolytic drug treatment, reverts the malignant phenotype of tumor cells. The clinical relevance of TIS was validated in ovarian and prostate cancer patients, highlighting increased accumulation of lipofuscin aggregates, a marker of the senescent phenotype, in the stromal compartment of tissues from chemotherapy-treated patients.

The malignant progression and resistance of many carcinomas depend on EMT activation, partial EMT, or hybrid E/M status in neoplastic cells. EMT is activated by tumor microenvironmental TGFβ signal and EMT-inducing transcription factors, such as ZEB1/2, in tumor cells. However, reverse EMT factors are less studied. We demonstrate that prostate epithelial transcription factor SCAND1 can reverse the cancer cell mesenchymal and hybrid E/M phenotypes to a more epithelial, less invasive status and inhibit their proliferation and migration in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. SCAND1 is a SCAN domain-containing protein and hetero-oligomerizes with SCAN-zinc finger transcription factors, such as MZF1, for accessing DNA and the transcriptional co-repression of target genes. We found that SCAND1 expression correlated with maintaining epithelial features, whereas the loss of SCAND1 was associated with mesenchymal phenotypes of tumor cells. SCAND1 and MZF1 were mutually inducible and coordinately included in chromatin with hetero-chromatin protein HP1γ. The overexpression of SCAND1 reversed hybrid E/M status into an epithelial phenotype with E-cadherin and β-catenin relocation. Consistently, the co-expression analysis in TCGA PanCancer Atlas revealed that SCAND1 and MZF1 expression was negatively correlated with EMT driver genes, including CTNNB1, ZEB1, ZEB2 and TGFBRs, in prostate adenocarcinoma specimens. In addition, SCAND1 overexpression suppressed tumor cell proliferation by reducing the MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Of note, in a mouse tumor xenograft model, SCAND1 overexpression significantly reduced Ki-67(+) and Vimentin(+) tumor cells and inhibited migration and lymph node metastasis of prostate cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed high expression of SCAND1 and MZF1 to correlate with better prognoses in pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancers, although with poorer prognosis in kidney cancer. Overall, these data suggest that SCAND1 induces expression and coordinated heterochromatin-binding of MZF1 to reverse the hybrid E/M status into an epithelial phenotype and, inhibits tumor cell proliferation, migration, and metastasis, potentially by repressing the gene expression of EMT drivers and the MAP3K-MEK-ERK signaling pathway.""","""['Takanori Eguchi', 'Eva Csizmadia', 'Hotaka Kawai', 'Mona Sheta', 'Kunihiro Yoshida', 'Thomas L Prince', 'Barbara Wegiel', 'Stuart K Calderwood']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Stress-Inducible SCAND Factors Suppress the Stress Response and Are Biomarkers for Enhanced Prognosis in Cancers.', 'Zinc-Dependent Regulation of ZEB1 and YAP1 Coactivation Promotes Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Plasticity and Metastasis in Pancreatic Cancer.', 'SPARC Induces E-Cadherin Repression and Enhances Cell Migration through Integrin αvβ3 and the Transcription Factor ZEB1 in Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'Oncogenic functions of the EMT-related transcription factor ZEB1 in breast cancer.', 'Stress-Inducible SCAND Factors Suppress the Stress Response and Are Biomarkers for Enhanced Prognosis in Cancers.', 'Extracellular Vesicles: New Classification and Tumor Immunosuppression.']"""

In our study we show a counter-regulatory link between AR and NF-κB both in human cells and in mouse models of prostate cancer, implying that inhibition of AR signaling results in induction of NF-κB-dependent inflammatory pathways, which may even foster the survival of metastasizing cells. This could be shown by reporter gene assays, DNA-binding measurements, and immune-fluorescence microscopy, and furthermore by a whole set of computational methods using a variety of datasets. Interestingly, loss of PTEN, a frequent genetic alteration in prostate cancer, also causes an upregulation of NF-κB and inflammatory activity. Finally, we present a mathematical model of a dynamic network between AR, NF-κB/IκB, PI3K/PTEN, and the oncogene c-Myc, which indicates that AR blockade may upregulate c-Myc together with NF-κB, and that combined anti-AR/anti-NF-κB and anti-PI3K treatment might be beneficial.""","""['José Basílio', 'Bernhard Hochreiter', 'Bastian Hoesel', 'Emira Sheshori', 'Marion Mussbacher', 'Rudolf Hanel', 'Johannes A Schmid']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Restoration of FKBP51 protein promotes the progression of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'NF-kappaB regulates androgen receptor expression and prostate cancer growth.', 'NF-κB and androgen receptor variant expression correlate with human BPH progression.', 'NF-κB signaling promotes castration-resistant prostate cancer initiation and progression.', 'NF-kappaB activation in human prostate cancer: important mediator or epiphenomenon?', 'Androgen Receptor Upregulates Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue 1 to Induce NF-κB Activity via Androgen-Dependent and -Independent Pathways in Prostate Carcinoma Cells.', 'NF-κB in monocytes and macrophages - an inflammatory master regulator in multitalented immune cells.']"""

Recently, studies have found that UNC5A plays an important role in multiple cancers, such as bladder cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and colon cancer but its pan-cancer function is largely unknown. Herein, the R software and multiple databases or online websites (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER), The Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA), and cBioPortal etc.) were utilized to examine the role of UNC5A in pan-cancer. UNC5A was found to be highly expressed across multiple human cancer tissues and cells, was linked to clinical outcomes of patients, and was a potential pan-cancer biomarker. The mutational landscape of UNC5A exhibited that patients with UNC5A mutations had poorer progress free survival (PFS) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Furthermore, UNC5A expression was associated with tumor mutation burden (TMB), neoantigen, tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor microsatellite instability (MSI), immunomodulators, immune infiltration, DNA methylation, immune checkpoint (ICP) genes, and drug responses.

To detect PSA, several studies have proposed using antibodies, which are not economical and require a long reaction time. In this study, we propose to use self-assembled thiolated single-strand DNA on electrodes functionalized by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) modified with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to realize a low-cost label-free electrochemical biosensor. In this regard, the PSA aptamer was immobilized via electrostatic adsorption on the surface of a screen-printed MWCNT/AuNPs electrode. The immobilization process was enhanced due to the presence of Au nanoparticles on the surface of the electrode. Surface characterization of the electrode at different stages of modification was performed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and contact angle for surface tension properties. The results showed an increase in surface roughness due to the absorbance of the aptamer on the electrode surfaces. The developed sensor has an extended linear range of 1-100 ng/mL, and a very low limit of detection down to 1 pg/mL. In addition, the reaction has a binding time of only five minutes on the developed electrodes. Investigations of the biosensor selectivity against several substances revealed an efficient selectivity for PSA detection. With this approach, low-cost biosensors with high sensitivity can be realized which have a wide linearity range and a low limit of detection, which are necessary for the early detection of prostate cancer.""","""['Aseel Alnaimi', 'Ammar Al-Hamry', 'Yahia Makableh', 'Anurag Adiraju', 'Olfa Kanoun']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biosensors (Basel)""","""['Electrochemical bioassay development for ultrasensitive aptasensing of prostate specific antigen.', 'A Sensitive Aptamer-Based Biosensor for Electrochemical Quantification of PSA as a Specific Diagnostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection of Oxytetracycline Using an Electrochemical Label-Free Aptamer-Based Biosensor.', 'Novel electrochemical aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of sulfadimidine based on covalently linked multi-walled carbon nanotubes and in situ synthesized gold nanoparticle composites.', 'Recent advances in gold electrode fabrication for low-resource setting biosensing.', 'Fabrication of impedimetric sensor based on metallic nanoparticle for the determination of mesna anticancer drug.', 'Microfluidic Platform Integrated with Carbon Nanofibers-Decorated Gold Nanoporous Sensing Device for Serum PSA Quantification.']"""

Studies in cells and mice have highlighted the importance of oxidative metabolism and lipogenesis in prostate cancer; however, the metabolic landscape of human prostate cancer remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we performed radiometric (14C) and stable (13C) isotope tracing assays in precision-cut slices of patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Glucose, glutamine, and fatty acid oxidation was variably upregulated in malignant PDXs compared with benign PDXs. De novo lipogenesis (DNL) and storage of free fatty acids into phospholipids and triacylglycerols were increased in malignant PDXs. There was no difference in substrate utilization between localized and metastatic PDXs and hierarchical clustering revealed marked metabolic heterogeneity across all PDXs. Mechanistically, glucose utilization was mediated by acetyl-CoA production rather than carboxylation of pyruvate, while glutamine entered the tricarboxylic acid cycle through transaminase reactions before being utilized via oxidative or reductive pathways. Blocking fatty acid uptake or fatty acid oxidation with pharmacologic inhibitors was sufficient to reduce cell viability in PDX-derived organoids, whereas blockade of DNL, or glucose or glutamine oxidation induced variable and limited therapeutic efficacy. These findings demonstrate that human prostate cancer, irrespective of disease stage, can effectively utilize all metabolic substrates, albeit with marked heterogeneity across tumors. We also confirm that fatty acid uptake and oxidation are targetable metabolic dependencies in human prostate cancer.

The objectives of the present study were to assess the feasibility of using an anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen (anti-PSMA) antibody conjugated with a fluorophore to characterize fresh prostate tissue as prostatic or non-prostatic for intra-operative surgical margin detection.  Methods:   Fresh prostatic tissue samples were collected from transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP) or prostate biopsies, and either immunolabelled with anti-PSMA antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 or used as controls. A dedicated, laparoscopy-compliant fluorescence device was developed for real-time fluorescence detection. Confocal microscopy was used as the gold standard for comparison. Spectral unmixing was used to distinguish specific, Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence from nonspecific autofluorescence.  Results:   The average peak wavelength of the immuno-labeled TURP samples (n = 4) was 541.7 ± 0.9 nm and of the control samples (n = 4) was 540.8 ± 2.2 nm. Spectral unmixing revealed that these similar measures were explained by significant autofluorescence, linked to electrocautery. Three biopsy samples were then obtained from seven patients and also displayed significant nonspecific fluorescence, raising questions regarding the reproducibility of the fixation of the anti-PSMA antibodies on the samples. Comparing the fluorescence results with final pathology proved challenging due to the small sample size and tissue alterations.  Conclusions:   This study showed similar fluorescence of immuno-labeled prostate tissue samples and controls, failing to demonstrate the feasibility of intra-operative margin detection using PSMA immuno-labeling, due to marked tissue autofluorescence.

Methods:   Water-unsuppressed 3D MRSI data were acquired from a phantom, from healthy volunteers, and a patient with prostate cancer. Signal processing included sequential computation of the modulus of the FID to remove water sidebands, a Hilbert transformation, and k-space Hamming filtering. For the removal of the water signal, we compared Löwner tensor-based blind source separation (BSS) and Hankel Lanczos singular value decomposition techniques. Absolute metabolite levels were quantified with LCModel and the results were statistically analyzed to compare the water removal methods and conventional water-suppressed MRSI.  Results:   The post-processing algorithms successfully removed the water signal and its sidebands without affecting metabolite signals. The best water removal performance was achieved by Löwner tensor-based BSS. Absolute tissue concentrations of citrate in the peripheral zone derived from water-suppressed and unsuppressed 1 H MRSI were the same and as expected from the known physiology of the healthy prostate. Maps for citrate and choline from water-unsuppressed 3D 1 H-MRSI of the prostate showed expected spatial variations in metabolite levels.  Conclusion:   We developed a robust relatively simple post-processing method of water-unsuppressed MRSI of the prostate to remove the water signal.

However, no consensus has been achieved on the optimal parameters of IRE for prostate cancer. Since high voltage is known to carry risks of muscle contraction and patient discomfort, it is crucial to identify the minimum but effective and safer applied voltage to inhibit tumor growth. In this study, the effect of different applied voltages of IRE on prostate cancer was evaluated in BALB/c nude mice. Mathematical simulation and measurement of the actual ablation area revealed a larger ablation area at a higher voltage. In in vivo experiment, except for the three different voltages applied, all groups received identical electrical conditions: pulse number, 180 (20 groups × 9 pulses/group); pulse width, 100 µs; pulse interval, 2 ms; distance between the electrodes, 5 mm; and electrode exposure length, 15 mm. Whilst the tumor volume initially decreased in the 500 V (1000 V/cm) and 700 V (1400 V/cm) groups and subsequently increased, only a transient increase followed by a continuous decrease until the sacrifice was observed in the 900 V (1800 V/cm) group. This result demonstrated a lasting effect of a higher applied voltage on tumor growth inhibition. The histological, immunohistochemical, and western blot findings all confirmed IRE-induced apoptosis in the treatment groups. Taken together, 900 V seemed to be the minimum applied voltage required to reduce tumor growth, though subsequent studies are anticipated to further narrow the voltage intervals and lower the minimum voltage required for tumor inhibition.""","""['Hong Bae Kim#', 'Chu Hui Zeng#', 'Yunlim Kim', 'Seung Jeong', 'Song Hee Kim', 'Jeon Min Kang', 'Yubeen Park', 'Dong-Sung Won', 'Ji Won Kim', 'Dae Sung Ryu', 'Bumjin Lim', 'Jung-Hoon Park']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Novel platinum bipolar electrode for irreversible electroporation in prostate cancer: preclinical study in the beagle prostate.', 'Irreversible electroporation ablation: is all the damage nonthermal?', 'Irreversible electroporation ablation: creation of large-volume ablation zones in in vivo porcine liver with four-electrode arrays.', 'Why we should not routinely apply irreversible electroporation as an alternative curative treatment modality for localized prostate cancer at this stage.', 'Irreversible Electroporation for the Ablation of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Thirty patients with prostate cancer qualified for radical prostatectomy were enrolled into the study. All patients underwent transrectal strain elastography and shear wave elastography during pre-surgical evaluation. In each prostate, 36 regions were evaluated separately whether there was a suspicious prostate cancer lesion or not. Subsequently, the same regions were analyzed during histological analysis of the resected gland. Strain elastography and shear wave elastography (overall stiffness cutoff value = 35 kPa) in our study were characterized by overall sensitivities of 58.9% and 65.3% and specificities of 71.8% and 70.2%, respectively. Cutoff values specific to the zones in the shear wave elastography examination (peripheral zone: 35 kPa, transitional zone: 45 kPa) were characterized by an overall prostate cancer detection sensitivity and specificity of 63.4% and 73% respectively. Shear wave elastography examination revealed a higher sensitivity versus strain elastography, 63.4% versus 58.9% (p = 0.038, p < 0.05), and comparable specificity, 73.0% versus 71.8% (p = 0.547, p > 0.05), respectively. Sensitivity in prostate cancer detection for both methods is higher for larger lesions (except Gleason score 5 massive lesions in strain elastography).

The PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathway has been associated with the development of resistance, raising the possibility that pathway inhibitors may produce a clinical benefit. This open-label phase Ib study examined the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary clinical activity of adding capivasertib - a potent, selective inhibitor of AKT1/2/3 - to approved abiraterone acetate therapy.  Methods:   Twenty-seven patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had undergone at least 1 prior line of systemic therapy received abiraterone acetate 1000 mg (orally administered once daily), plus oral prednisone 5 mg (twice daily) with capivasertib 400 mg (orally, twice daily, with an intermittent schedule of 4 days on, 3 days off).  Results:   No dose-limiting toxicity was observed. The most frequent adverse events (all grade) were diarrhea (30%), anemia (26%), asthenia (22%), and nausea (22%). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were acute kidney injury (19%), hyperglycemia (7%), rash (7%), abdominal pain (7%), and asthenia (7%).

Materials and methods:   In this study, cell viability assay, colony formation assay, soft agar assay, cell proliferation curve assay, and EdU assay were employed to determine the anti-proliferation effect induced by BPH. Cell cycle distribution was detected by flow cytometry. DNA damage in cells treated with BPH was indicated by comet assay, immunofluorescence, and Western Blot. Both the 4T1 orthotopic tumor model and the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumor model were used to assess in vivo effect of BPH (312.5, and 625 mg/kg). The protein expression levels of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway and the MAPK/ERK pathway were detected by Western Blot.  Results:   Our results indicated that TNBC cells were more sensitive to BPH than mammary epithelial cells. Cell proliferation of TNBC cells was significantly inhibited by BPH in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, BPH induced DNA damage in TNBC cells in a concentration and time-dependent manner. DDR of TNBC cells was inhibited by BPH. MAPK/ERK pathway was inhibited in cells treated with BPH, and DNA damage can be reversed while EGF was added to activate MAPK/ERK pathway. The 4T1 orthotopic tumor model and the MDA-MB-231 subcutaneous tumor model further confirmed that BPH inhibited TNBC proliferation via inhibition of DDR and MAPK/ERK pathway in vivo.

Curcuminoids, polyphenolic compounds, are the main pharmacological component from the rhizome of Curcuma longa L. Pharmacological investigations have found that curcuminoids have many pharmacological activities of anti-inflammatory, anti-tumour, and anti-metastasis.  Aim of the study:   3β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD1) catalyses the production of steroid precursors for androgens and estrogens, which play an essential role in cancer metastasis. We explored the potency and mode of action of curcuminoids and their metabolites of inhibiting 3β-HSD1 activity and compared the species difference between human and rat.  Materials and methods:   In this study, we investigated the direct inhibition of 6 curcuminoids on human placental 3β-HSD1 activity and compared the species-dependent difference in human 3β-HSD1 and rat placental homolog 3β-HSD4.  Results:   The inhibitory potency of curcuminoids on human 3β-HSD1 was demethoxycurcumin (IC50, 0.18 μM) > bisdemethoxycurcumin (0.21 μM)>curcumin (2.41 μM)> dihydrocurcumin (4.13 μM)>tetrahydrocurcumin (15.78 μM)>octahydrocurcumin (ineffective at 100 μM).

However, its role for prostate cancer is rarely understood. In this study, we intend to investigate the value of a new plasma cell molecular subtype for predicting the biochemical recurrence, immune escape and immunotherapy response in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Gene expression and clinicopathological data were collected from 481 prostate cancer patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas. Then, the immune characteristics of the patients were analyzed based on plasma cell infiltration fractions. The unsupervised clustering based machine learning algorithm was used to identify the molecular subtypes of the plasma cell. And the characteristic genes of plasma cell subtypes were screened out by three types of machine learning models to establish an artificial neural network for predicting plasma cell subtypes. Finally, the prediction artificial neural network of plasma cell infiltration subtypes was validated in an independent cohort of 449 prostate cancer patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus.  Results:   The plasma cell fraction in prostate cancer was significantly decreased in tumors with high T stage, high Gleason score and lymph node metastasis. In addition, low plasma cell fraction patients had a higher risk of biochemical recurrence. Based on the differential genes of plasma cells, plasma cell infiltration status of PCa patients were divided into two independent molecular subtypes(subtype 1 and subtype 2). Subtype 1 tends to be immunosuppressive plasma cells infiltrating to the PCa region, with a higher likelihood of biochemical recurrence, more active immune microenvironment, and stronger immune escape potential, leading to a poor response to immunotherapy. Subsequently, 10 characteristic genes of plasma cell subtype were screened out by three machine learning algorithms. Finally, an artificial neural network was constructed by those 10 genes to predict the plasma cell subtype of new patients.

To identify the associations between sTfR and the prevalence of cancers, stratified multivariable logistic regression models, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed.  Results:   In tertile analyses, participants in the highest level of sTfR were significantly associated with increased prevalence of total cancers [odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15-2.02] as compared with those at the lowest tertile. Each unit increment in ln-transformed sTfR concentration was shown to be associated with 39% increased risks of total cancers. Similar associations were found in males rather than females. Further subgroup and sensitivity analyses indicated that, in continuous and tertile analyses, sTfR was more closely associated with male- and female-specific cancers of prostate and testis (2.35: 1.03-5.40; 2.03: 1.00-4.09; respectively), and breast, cervix, ovary and uterus (1.92: 1.11-3.35; 1.66: 1.02-2.69; respectively).  Conclusions:   Our findings suggested that elevated level of sTfR was associated with the prevalence of cancers, especially in sex-specific cancers. In order to better determine them, further research in humans will be required.""","""['Yuzhuo Zhang', 'Nianci Xue', 'Wenyu Jia', 'Xikang Chen', 'Xuezhang Chen', 'Hongliang Li', 'Bin Wang', 'Yi Guo', 'Ju Chen', 'Huaqin Tian']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Increased Serum Soluble Transferrin Receptor Levels Were Associated With High Prevalence of Cardiovascular Diseases: Insights From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2018.', 'Association between soluble transferrin receptor and systolic hypertension in adults: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2007-2010 and 2015-2018).', 'Physiologically based serum ferritin thresholds for iron deficiency in children and non-pregnant women: a US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) serial cross-sectional study.', 'Soluble transferrin receptor for the evaluation of erythropoiesis and iron status.', 'Structure, function and clinical significance of transferrin receptors.']"""

We collected extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the blood plasma of PC patients with organ-confined, extracapsular-invading, and seminal vesicle-invading tumors and from healthy subjects. We examined the protein, mRNA, and miRNA content of these EVs using mass spectrometry (MS), a human PC PCR array, and a miScript miRNA PCR array, respectively. The proteomic analysis showed distinct groups of proteins that are differently expressed in each group of patients, as well as in healthy subjects. Samples from healthy subjects and each tumor type were used for both mRNA and miRNA arrays. The mRNA analysis showed distinct groups of mRNAs that were overexpressed in healthy or in one of the three tumor types but not in the EVs of the other groups. The miRNA analysis showed distinct groups of miRNAs as well. The fold of regulation in the expression of the identified mRNA and miRNA of each stage of the disease from healthy subjects showed that various mRNAs and miRNAs could discriminate the disease stage. Overall, our data suggest many molecular marker candidates for distinguishing between healthy subjects and PC patients using the cargo of circulating vesicles, as well as markers to discriminate between the different tumor types.

The goal of this study is to systematically evaluate rare, recurrent nonsynonymous variants across the exome for their association with PCa in AA men.  Methods:   Whole exome sequencing (WES) of germline DNA in two AA PCa patient cohorts of Johns Hopkins Hospital (N = 960) and Wayne State University (N = 747) was performed. All nonsynonymous variants present in both case cohorts, with a carrier rate between 0.5% and 1%, were identified. Their carrier rates were compared with rates from 8128 African/African American (AFR) control subjects from The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) using Fisher's exact test. Significant variants, defined as false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05, were further evaluated in AA PCa cases (N = 132) and controls (N = 1184) from the UK Biobank (UKB).  Results:   Two variants reached a pre-specified statistical significance level. The first was p.R14Q in GPRC5C (found in 0.47% of PCa cases and 0.01% of population controls); odds ratio (OR) for PCa was 37.46 (95% confidence interval CI 4.68-299.72), pexact = 7.01E-06, FDR-adjusted p-value = 0.05. The second was p.R511Q in IGF1R (found in 0.53% of PCa cases and 0.01% of population controls); OR for PCa was 21.54 (95%CI 4.65-99.76), pexact = 5.51E-06, FDR-adjusted p-value = 0.05. The mean percentage of African ancestry was similar between variant carriers and noncarriers of each variant, p > 0.05.

In this work, PSMA-specific binding peptides immobilized on a gold electrode were responsible for prostate cancer-derived exosomes capturing. Well-designed peptide (CCY- LWYIKC) serves a dual role: as a signal probe and as a recognizer in the exosomes-identification process. Specifically, LWYIKC bind to cholesterol at the exosome membranes, and CCY function as peptide templates to host a large number of silver nanoparticles, leading to a strong electrochemical signal. Thus, the concentration of exosomes can be quantified via electrochemical signal.

Normal prostate epithelial cells RWPE-1 and PCa cell lines DU145 and PC-3 were treated with ICA and curcumol. Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) or 3-MA was added to treat DU145 and PC-3 cells. In addition, we knocked down miR-7. The mechanism of ICA and curcumol in PCa cells after the knockdown of miR-7 was verified by in vitro nude mice tumorigenesis experiments. ICA and curcumol had no significant effect on the viability of RWPE-1 cells, but there was a significant difference between DU145 and PC-3 cells. After treatment with ICA and curcumol, the proliferation of PCa cells was inhibited, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and miR-7 expression were increased. The combined treatment of ICA and curcumol had a more significant effect. ICA and curcumol treatment induced autophagy and ferroptosis in PCa cells, and si-miR-7 reversed the effects of ICA and curcumol on autophagy and ferroptosis. MiR-7 targeted mTOR and regulated the expression of the mTOR/SREBP1 pathway in PCa cells. ICA and curcumol may affect the lipid metabolism of PCa cells by affecting SREBP1. In addition, the effects and mechanisms of ICA and curcumol on autophagy, ferroptosis, and lipid metabolism in PCa cells were verified in vivo.

Methods:   BRAF harbors a potential SPOP-binding consensus motif (SBC) motif. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that BRAF interacts with SPOP. A series of functional analyses in cell lines were performed to investigate the biological significance of MAPK/ERK activation caused by SPOP mutations.  Results:   Cytoplasmic SPOP binds to and induces non-degradative ubiquitination of BRAF, thereby reducing the interaction between BRAF and other core components of the MAPK/ERK pathway. SPOP ablation increased MAPK/ERK activation. EC- or PCa-associated SPOP mutants showed a reduced capacity to bind and ubiquitinate BRAF. Moreover, cancer-associated BRAF mutations disrupted the BRAF-SPOP interaction and allowed BRAF to evade SPOP-mediated ubiquitination, thereby upregulating MAPK/ERK signaling and enhancing the neoplastic phenotypes of cancer cells.

Patients and methods:   This retrospective study included 714 patients with non-metastatic PCa between 2006 and 2010 at our institute. The treatment modalities were classified as follows: radical prostatectomy (RP), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), brachytherapy (BT) and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). We defined life expectancy according to an abridged life table published by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan.  Results:   The median age and initial prostate-specific antigen levels at treatment were 71 years and 8.8 ng/mL, respectively. Advanced age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) ≥1, cT3a stage and ADT were independent poor prognostic factors for OS. OS and life expectancy did not significantly differ in all patients (p=0.32) and in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) high-risk group (p=0.059).

Materials and methods:   We selected three CBCTs for each treatment course for 13 patients (seven with and six without use of FMs) treated at our centre. Seven experienced Radiation Oncologists retrospectively reviewed the CBCTs, recording couch movements for correct patient positioning, and time spent to do it. Analysis of variance and t-test were carried out for comparison of different groups and for differences in mean values of the movements recorded (with p<0.05 as significance level).  Results:   No statistically significant difference was found between operators in the analysis of images with FMs nor of images without them. A difference was only found in the mean corrections in couch rotation and pitch angle, which were higher in the FM group, and in the mean time for image analysis, which was shorter in this group. Using the van Herk formula, we found a possible reduction of clinical target volume and planning target volume margins for the FM group.  Conclusion:   According to our study, the use of intraprostatic FMs in daily CBCT seems useful for better detection of and correction for non-negligible rotational errors. Furthermore, FMs reduced the time to treatment start, which is very important in reducing the risk of intrafraction organ motion.

Bone health (BH) assessment is strongly recommended, together with timely initiation of treatments, to counteract CTIBL and preserve bone strength. Therefore, we decided to develop an interdisciplinary pathway of care (IPC) dedicated to non-metastatic PCa patients on long-term ADT and RT.  Patients and methods:   An interdisciplinary team allocated resources to support an IPC to manage patients' CTIBL and prevent fragility fractures. The team provided a diagnostic and therapeutic workflow according to patients' and professional perspectives, consistent with recommendations and healthcare policies. The hospital's quality department certified the IPC, the Ethical Committee approved procedures over the workflow. The Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) standards inspired services and professionals' activities and interactions.  Results:   Preliminary data support the feasibility of the IPC from professionals' and patients' perspectives.

Results:   The results revealed that both compounds exhibited stronger cytotoxicity to CRPC cells along with significant inhibition of colony formation, especially compound 1 Further experimental evidence indicated that 1 significantly inhibited DNA replication, induced cell-cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Additionally, treatment with 1 inhibited cell-matrix adhesion and migration of CRPC cells. Mechanistically, the results suggest that 1 inhibited FAK expression and phosphorylation, as well as affected its distribution, resulting in intense DNA damage and strong DNA damage response.  Conclusion:   We discovered two chalcone derivatives and collective results indicated that 1 inhibited CRPC cell proliferation and migration through FAK-mediated DNA damage and may be a potential therapeutic drug against CRPC.""","""['Hainiao Xiao', 'Zhigang Wu', 'Qinquan Wang', 'Chaofeng Zhou', 'Feng Lu', 'Yunbei Xiao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['A chalcone-syringaldehyde hybrid inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell proliferation and migration by inhibiting CKAP2-mediated FAK and STAT3 phosphorylation.', 'Piperlongumine inhibits migration and proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via triggering persistent DNA damage.', 'Rooibos suppresses proliferation of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Akt signaling.', 'Natural Chalcones and Their Derivatives Target the Tumor Microenvironment in Colon Cancer.', 'Oncopreventive and Oncotherapeutic Potential of Licorice Chalcone Compounds: Molecular Insights.']"""

Patients and methods:   Forty newly diagnosed, therapy naïve patients with prostatic carcinoma (PC) (mean age of 56.7, range=34-79), who were referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/MRI for primary staging and had undergone radical prostatectomy (RAPE) were included in this prospective study. Their blood samples were tested for serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and proPSA. The patients' prostates were evaluated using whole-mount sections, which helped determine the extent and grade of the tumor; tests were performed to determine immunohistochemical PSMA expression.  Results:   A correlation between PSMA expression and the accumulation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 was found using the Spearman correlation coefficient (p=0.0011). A stronger correlation was found between Gleason patterns 3 or 4 and PSMA expression (p=0.06). Furthermore, the correlation of Gleason score with the overall 68Ga-PSMA-11 accumulation within the tumor or non-tumor tissue was found to be significant (p=0.0157). A significant relation was found only with the Kep elimination rate constant, which was stronger in Gleason pattern 4 than in Gleason pattern 3. A weaker correlation was found between the accumulation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and Ktrans in Gleason pattern 4: the most significant relation being between ADCmin and Gleason pattern 3 and 4 (p=0.0074).

Patients and methods:   This is an observational study focused on exploring the structuring process and implementing a multi-institutional virtual MDTB in Sicily, Italy. Other endpoints included the analysis of cooperation between participants, adherence to guidelines, patient outcomes, and patient satisfaction.  Results:   Overall, 126 patients were referred to the virtual MDTB for a total of 302 cases discussed in an 18-month period. Nearly 45% of cases were referred from general hospitals or tertiary centers, 38% from comprehensive cancer centers, and only 17% from academic ones. Most health professional participants (95%) reported eliminating geographical barriers and consequently reducing costs and saving time as key advantages of virtual meetings over face-to-face ones. Using a specifically designed platform for virtual MDTBs was another excellent point, especially to geolocate clinical trials and time-lapse data storage. The majority of referred patients had stage T 3-4 prostate cancer (79%). Overall, 71% of proposals discussed were approved unchanged, while 19% changed after the virtual MDTB discussion. Debated points were mostly radiologic, surgical, medical, or radiation treatment-related issues. In particular, the prescriptive appropriateness of positron emission tomography with 68Ga-prostatic specific membrane antigen, newer drugs, radiation versus surgical approach, stage T3-4 cases, and adjuvant therapy represented the most debated issues. The proposed diagnostic and/or therapeutic options were controlled for adherence to the guidelines and/or updated scientific evidence. Overall, 98% of approved proposals and changes were in line with the guidelines. Overall, most participants felt virtual MDTB was very useful and case discussions led to a major change of strategy in 19% of cases.

Materials and methods:   PC3 cells were treated with LQB-118 or Paclitaxel (PTX), and cell migration (wound healing and Boyden chamber assays) and invasion (matrigel assay) were determined. The LQB-118 mechanisms were evaluated by αVβIII protein expression (flow cytometry), protein phosphorylation (Western blot), and mRNA expression (qPCR).  Results:   LQB-118 impaired PCa cell migration and invasion, down-regulated Akt phosphorylation, and also reduced GSK3β phosphorylation, through a FAK-independent pathway. Also, it was observed that LQB-118 controlled the invasiveness behavior by reducing matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and up-regulating reversion-inducing cysteine rich protein with Kazal motifs (Reck) mRNA levels. Interestingly, LQB-118 increased integrin αvβIII expression, but this effect was not related to its activation, since the cell adhesion ability was reduced after LQB-118 treatment.  Conclusion:   These data highlight novel LQB-118 mechanisms in prostate cancer cells. LQB-118 acts as a negative regulator of the Akt/GSK3 signaling pathway and can modulate PCa cell proliferation, death, and migration/invasion. The results also support the use of LQB-118 for the treatment of metastatic PCa, alone or combined with another chemotherapeutic agent, due to its demonstrated pleiotropic activities.""","""['Thiago Martino', 'Graziele Freitas DE Bem', 'Shirley Vania Moura Santos', 'Marsen Garcia Pinto Coelho', 'Angela DE Castro Resende', 'Chaquip Netto', 'Paulo Roberto Ribeiro Costa', 'Graça Justo', 'Katia Costa DE Carvalho Sabino']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Down-regulated microRNA-30b-3p inhibits proliferation, invasion and migration of glioma cells via inactivation of the AKT signaling pathway by up-regulating RECK.', 'The pterocarpanquinone LQB-118 inhibits tumor cell proliferation by downregulation of c-Myc and cyclins D1 and B1 mRNA and upregulation of p21 cell cycle inhibitor expression.', 'The chemopreventive retinoid 4HPR impairs prostate cancer cell migration and invasion by interfering with FAK/AKT/GSK3beta pathway and beta-catenin stability.', 'Reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs and its regulation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 signaling in oral cancer.', 'Long non-coding DANCR targets miR-185-5p to upregulate LIM and SH3 protein 1 promoting prostate cancer via the FAK/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/snail pathway.']"""

The effect was more pronounced when ADT was given for more than 12 months. However, in all these analyses, two of the strongest AD risk factors after age, family history of AD and the apolipoprotein e4 allele, were not included. In the current study, we have used data from the UK Biobank (UKB) that incorporates these two factors.  Patients and methods:   Our analysis included all subjects with prostate cancer and AD. Prostate cancer diagnosis was ascertained using the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10), C61. AD diagnosis was ascertained using the 10th Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD10) G30. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for rs429358 and rs7412 were used to determine ApoE genotypes. ADT was in UKB field 20003, Treatment/medication code, Medications. Family history of AD was in UKB data fields 20107, Illnesses of father; 20110, Illnesses of mother; 20111, Illnesses of siblings.  Results:   We studied 13,203 men with prostate cancer. The age of 132 subjects that received ADT was 64±5.6 (mean±standard deviation), and the age of 13,071 subjects that did not receive ADT was 62±5.6 (p<0.001). ADT was not associated with AD, but Apoe3e3 was significantly associated with diminished risk of AD when compared to e4e4. Moreover, every year of age was associated with increased risk of AD. ADT was unrelated to AD (p=0.997).  Conclusion:   Our UK Biobank data analysis does not confirm that ADT causes AD in men with prostate cancer.

Results:   The cytotoxicity of expanded HI γδ T cells against Huh7 cells was associated with a higher pyrophosphate expression in Huh7 cells compared to SNU398 cells. In contrast, the cytotoxicity of HI γδ T cells against SNU398 cells depended on NKG2D. HI γδ T cells expressed less PD-1 than PB γδ T cells. The cytotoxicity of HI γδ T cells against Du145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells was also associated with pyrophosphate expression in these cells, as well as NKG2D and DNAM-1.

Due to the persistence of PFAS chemicals in the human body and their ability to bioaccumulate, firefighters experience the latent and cumulative effects of PFAS-containing AFFF exposure that occurs throughout their careers. This article summarizes the history of AFFF use by firefighters and current AFFF use practices. In addition, this paper describes PFAS levels in firefighter serum, PFAS serum removal pathways, PFAS exposure pathways, and occupational factors affecting PFAS levels in firefighters. International, national, and state agencies have concluded that PFOA, a long-chain PFAS, is potentially carcinogenic and that carcinogens have an additive effect. From the cancer types that may be associated with PFAS exposure, studies on cancer risk among firefighters have shown an elevated risk for thyroid, kidney, bladder, testicular, prostate, and colon cancer.

The aim of this study was a comprehensive analysis of the NPY system in prostate pathology.  Methods:   The study was based on immunohistochemical analysis of NPY and its receptors, Y1R, Y2R and Y5R, in tissue samples from benign prostate (BP), primary prostate cancer (PCa) and PCa bone metastases. Tissue microarray (TMA) technique was employed, with analysis of multiple cores from each specimen. Intensity of the immunoreactivity and expression index (EI), as well as distribution of the immunostaining in neoplastic cells and stromal elements were evaluated. Perineural invasion (PNI) and extraprostatic extension (EPE) were areas of special interests. Moreover, a transwell migration assay on the LNCaP PCa cell line was used to assess the chemotactic properties of NPY.  Results:   Morphological analysis revealed homogeneous membrane and cytoplasmic pattern of NPY staining in cancer cells and its membrane localization with apical accentuation in BP glands. All elements of the NPY system were upregulated in pre-invasive prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, PCa and metastases. EI and staining intensity of NPY receptors were significantly higher in PCa then in BP with correlation between Y2R and Y5R. The strength of expression of the NPY system was further increased in the PNI and EPE areas. In bone metastases, Y1R and Y5R presented high expression scores.  Conclusion:   The results of our study suggest that the NPY system is involved in PCa, starting from early stages of its development to disseminated states of the disease, and participates in the invasion of PCa into the auto and paracrine matter.""","""['Dawid Sigorski', 'Wojciech Wesołowski', 'Agnieszka Gruszecka', 'Jacek Gulczyński', 'Piotr Zieliński', 'Sara Misiukiewicz', 'Joanna Kitlińska', 'Ewa Iżycka-Świeszewska']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Neuropeptide Y Y5-receptor activation on breast cancer cells acts as a paracrine system that stimulates VEGF expression and secretion to promote angiogenesis.', 'Neuropeptide Y receptor interactions regulate its mitogenic activity.', 'Adipose Y5R mRNA is higher in obese than non-obese humans and is correlated with obesity parameters.', 'Neuropeptide Y (NPY) in tumor growth and progression: Lessons learned from pediatric oncology.', 'Modulatory actions of neuropeptide Y on prostate cancer growth: role of MAP kinase/ERK 1/2 activation.']"""

Among them, [18F]PSMA-1007 has several advantages, including a comparatively long half-life, delayed renal excretion, and compatible structure with α-/β-particle emitter-labeled therapeutics. This study aimed to characterize the preclinical pharmacokinetics and internal radiation dosimetry of [18F]PSMA-1007, as well as its repeatability and specificity for target binding using prostate tumor-bearing mice.

Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data and the Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty, we identified Medicare beneficiaries who initiated systemic therapy for mCRPC between 2008 and 2017 (n = 9172). Primary outcomes included 1) bone-modifying agents (BMA) use, 2) time on systemic therapy, 3) survival, and 4) Medicare spending for the first 3 months following therapy initiation. We used a differences-in-differences approach to estimate the impact of vertical integration on outcomes, adjusting for patient and provider characteristics.  Results:   The proportion of patients treated by integrated oncologists increased from 28% to 55% from 2008 to 2017. Vertical integration was associated with an 11.7 percentage point (95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.2 to 19.1) increased likelihood of BMA use. There were no satistically significant changes in time on systemic therapy, survival, or total per-patient Medicare spending.

Androgen receptor (AR) regulation is complex and remains elusive, despite several studies tackling these issues. Therefore, elucidating the mechanism(s) underlying AR regulation is a potentially promising approach to suppressing PCa.  Methods:   We report that Par14, one isoform of the prolyl isomerases homologous to Pin1, is a critical regulator of AR transcriptional activity and is essential for PCa cell growth.  Results:   Par14 was shown to be overexpressed in PCa, based on analyses of deposited data. Importantly, overexpression of Par14 significantly enhanced androgen-sensitive LNCap cell growth. In contrast, silencing of Par14 dramatically decreased cell growth in LNCap cells by causing cell cycle arrest. Mechanistically, silencing of the Par14 gene dramatically induced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 at both the mRNA and the protein level through modulating the localization of p53. In addition, suppression of Par14 in LNCap cells was shown to downregulate the expressions of androgen response genes, at both the mRNA and the protein level, induced by dihydrotestosterone. Par14 was shown to directly associate with AR in nuclei via its DNA-binding domain and augment AR transcriptional activity.  Conclusion:   Thus, Par14 plays a critical role in PCa progression, and its enhancing effects on AR signaling are likely to be involved in the underlying molecular mechanisms.

MRI-guided focal laser ablation (FLA) therapy is an alternative, minimally invasive treatment method to conventional therapies, which has been demonstrated to control low-grade, localized PCa while preserving patient quality of life. The therapeutic success of FLA depends on the accurate placement of needles for adequate delivery of ablative energy to the target lesion. We previously developed an MR-compatible mechatronic system for prostate FLA needle guidance and validated its performance in open-air and clinical 3T in-bore experiments using virtual targets.  Purpose:   To develop a robust MRI-to-mechatronic system registration method and evaluate its in-bore MR-guided needle delivery accuracy in tissue-mimicking prostate phantoms.  Methods:   The improved registration multifiducial assembly houses thirty-six aqueous gadolinium-filled spheres distributed over a 7.3 × 7.3 × 5.2 cm volume. MRI-guided needle guidance accuracy was quantified in agar-based tissue-mimicking prostate phantoms on trajectories (N = 44) to virtual targets covering the mechatronic system's range of motion. 3T gradient-echo recalled (GRE) MRI images were acquired after needle insertions to each target, and the air-filled needle tracks were segmented. Needle guidance error was measured as the shortest Euclidean distance between the target point and the segmented needle trajectory, and angular error was measured as the angle between the targeted trajectory and the segmented needle trajectory. These measurements were made using both the previously designed four-sphere registration fiducial assembly on trajectories (N = 7) and compared with the improved multifiducial assembly using a Mann-Whitney U test.  Results:   The median needle guidance error of the system using the improved registration fiducial assembly at a depth of 10 cm was 1.02 mm with an interquartile range (IQR) of 0.42-2.94 mm. The upper limit of the one-sided 95% prediction interval of needle guidance error was 4.13 mm. The median (IQR) angular error was 0.0097 rad (0.0057-0.015 rad) with a one-sided 95% prediction interval upper limit of 0.022 rad. The median (IQR) positioning error using the previous four-sphere registration fiducial assembly was 1.87 mm (1.77-2.14 mm). This was found to be significantly different (p = 0.0012) from the median (IQR) positioning error of 0.28 mm (0.14-0.95 mm) using the new registration fiducial assembly on the same trajectories. No significant difference was detected between the medians of the angular errors (p = 0.26).  Conclusion:   This is the first study presenting an improved registration method and validation in tissue-mimicking phantoms of our remotely actuated MR-compatible mechatronic system for delivery of prostate FLA needles. Accounting for the effects of needle deflection, the system was demonstrated to be capable of needle delivery with an error of 4.13 mm or less in 95% of cases under ideal conditions, which is a statistically significant improvement over the previous method. The system will next be validated in a clinical setting.""","""['Eric Knull', 'Claire Keun Sun Park', 'Jeffrey Bax', 'David Tessier', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Design and validation of an MRI-compatible mechatronic system for needle delivery to localized prostate cancer.', 'A system for MRI-guided transperineal delivery of needles to the prostate for focal therapy.', 'Mechatronic system for in-bore MRI-guided insertion of needles to the prostate: An in vivo needle guidance accuracy study.', 'Targeted prostate biopsy and MR-guided therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Focal ablation of prostate cancer: four roles for magnetic resonance imaging guidance.']"""

Before undergoing germline genetic testing, these patients should receive pre-test counseling. In the standard genetic care pathway, pre-test counseling is provided by a healthcare professional of a genetics department. Because the number of patients with metastatic prostate cancer is large, the capacity in the genetics departments might be insufficient. Therefore, we aim to implement so-called mainstream genetic testing in the Netherlands for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In a mainstream genetic testing pathway, non-genetic healthcare professionals discuss and order germline genetic testing. In our DISCOVER study, we will assess the experiences among patients and non-genetic healthcare professionals with this new pathway.  Methods:   A multicenter prospective observational cohort study will be conducted in 15 hospitals, in different regions of the Netherlands. We developed an online training module on genetics in prostate cancer and the counseling of patients. After completion of this module, non-genetic healthcare professionals will provide pre-test counseling and order germline genetic testing in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Both non-genetic healthcare professionals and patients receive three questionnaires. We will determine the experience with mainstream genetic testing, based on satisfaction and acceptability. Patients with a pathogenic germline variant will also be interviewed. We will determine the efficacy of the mainstreaming pathway, based on time investment for non-genetic healthcare professionals and the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants.  Discussion:   This study is intended to be one of the largest studies on mainstream genetic testing in prostate cancer. The results of this study can improve the mainstream genetic testing pathway in patients with prostate cancer.

We therefore hypothesised that follow-up can be shortened for many patients without increasing the risk of prostate cancer death. We investigated the long-term probabilities of PSA recurrence, metastases and prostate cancer death in patients without biochemical recurrence five and 10 years after radical prostatectomy.  Design:   Prospective cohort study. Stratification by Gleason score (≤3+4=7 or ≥4+3=7), pathological tumour stage (pT2 or ≥pT3) and negative or positive surgical margins.  Setting:   Between 1989 and 1998, 14 urological centres in Scandinavia randomised patients to the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group study number 4 (SPCG-4) trial.  Participation:   All 306 patients from the SPCG-4 trial who underwent radical prostatectomy within 1 year from inclusion were eligible. Four patients were excluded due to surgery-related death (n=1) or salvage radiotherapy or hormonal treatment within 6 weeks from surgery (n=3).  Primary outcome measures:   Cumulative incidences and absolute differences in metastatic disease and prostate cancer death.  Results:   We analysed 302 patients with complete follow-up during a median of 24 years. Median preoperative PSA was 9.8 ng/mL and median age was 65 years. For patients without biochemical recurrence 5 years after radical prostatectomy the 20-year probability of biochemical recurrence was 25% among men with Gleason score ≤3+4=7 and 57% among men with Gleason score ≥4+3=7; the probabilities for metastases were 0.8% and 17%; and for prostate cancer death 0.8% and 12%, respectively. The long-term probabilities were higher for pT ≥3 versus pT2 and for positive versus negative surgical margins. Limitations include small size of the cohort.

Methods: A total of 103 patients (metastatic hormone-sensitive PC, n = 57; castration-resistant PC, n = 46) underwent taxane-based chemotherapy. All patients had a minimum of 2 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET scans (at baseline and up to 3 mo after treatment). PSMA PET response was assessed by RECIST 1.1, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (using PSMA PET instead of bone scan), aPERCIST, and PSMA PET progression (PPP) criteria. Response by each criterion was stratified by either progressive disease (PD) or non-PD. For aPERCIST, stratification by PD, stable disease (SD), and partial/complete remission (PR/CR) was performed. Biochemical response was determined by a prostate-specific antigen decrease of at least 50%. Subgroup analyses were performed by castration status. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses including Harrell's concordance indices were calculated to investigate the association of PD by response criteria and OS. Kaplan-Meier tests including log-rank statistics were calculated for survival analyses. Results: Twenty-six (25%) patients had unmeasurable disease by RECIST 1.1. PD by any response criterion was associated with an at least 2.5-fold increased risk of death and was highest for PD versus CR/PR by aPERCIST (hazard ratio, 11.4) on univariable regression. Stratified by castration status, a similar pattern was observed. PD by any criterion as associated with significantly shortened OS across overall and subgroup analyses. PR/CR by aPERCIST identified patients with lower risk of death and longer OS compared with patients with PD or SD. Conclusion: PSMA PET-based response criteria (PPP, aPERCIST, adapted Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3) have high prognostic utility in men with metastatic PC undergoing taxane-based chemotherapy. PPP is simple to use, identified most patients with PD, and showed best prognostic utility regarding OS. PR/CR by aPERCIST identifies a subgroup of responders (PR/CR) showing better outcomes than patients with PD or SD.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is currently the only biomarker used to screen for the risk of developing PCa. Because PSA tests may show false positives, identifying novel PCa-specific biomarkers would improve prediction and diagnosis at an early stage. Previously, we identified a number of genes/microRNAs (miRNAs) in prostate tissue as potential biomarkers of chronic prostatitis in a rat model of chemical-induced prostatitis. The current study aimed to evaluate their potential for use as translational, diagnostic markers in humans.  Materials and methods:   We performed quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis using pathologically clear (normal) or confirmed PCa tissue samples from the same patients (N=18 per group).  Results:   Levels (relative fold changes) of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) transcripts were significantly lower in PCa tissues, compared with clear tissues, in a paired t-test (p=0.0075). Although neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) transcripts tended to be altered in PCa tissues, statistically insignificant differences were observed (p=0.0521). No statistically significant differences were observed for the other genes/miRNAs analyzed in PCa tissues due to a high degree of individual variance in expression.  Conclusion:   Similar to the results previously observed in rats, changes in the levels of BMP7 and NCAM1 transcripts were evident in human PCa tissues, suggesting that these genes may serve as potential diagnostic biomarkers during the early stages of PCa. Further studies are needed to determine the potential use of these molecules as biomarkers.""","""['Noriko Nakamura', 'Paul Rogers', 'Rémelle Eggerson', 'Steven R Post', 'Rodney Davis']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Diagnostic and prognostic value of serum miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression among egyptian patients with prostate cancer.', 'Serum Levels of miR-223-3p and miR-223-5p in Prostate Diseases.', 'Prostate health index and prostate cancer gene 3 score but not percent-free Prostate Specific Antigen have a predictive role in differentiating histological prostatitis from PCa and other nonneoplastic lesions (BPH and HG-PIN) at repeat biopsy.', 'miRNAs as biomarkers in prostate cancer.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

However, this is a clinically relevant task as quantitative image techniques assessing individual metastases, while limited, have been shown to be predictive of treatment outcome. The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficacy of deep learning-based methods for full-body delineation of skeletal metastases and to compare their performance to existing methods in terms of disease delineation accuracy and prognostic power.Approach.1833 suspicious lesions on 3718F-NaF PET/CT scans of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) were contoured and classified as malignant, equivocal, or benign by a nuclear medicine physician. Two convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (DeepMedic and nnUNet)were trained to delineate malignant disease regions with and without three-model ensembling. Malignant disease contours using previously established methods were obtained. The performance of each method was assessed in terms of four different tasks: (1) detection, (2) segmentation, (3) PET SUV metric correlations with physician-based data, and (4) prognostic power of progression-free survival.Main Results.The nnUnet three-model ensemble achieved superior detection performance with a mean (+/- standard deviation) sensitivity of 82.9±ccc 0.1% at the selected operating point. The nnUnet single and three-model ensemble achieved comparable segmentation performance with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.80±0.12 and 0.79±0.12, respectively, both outperforming other methods. The nnUNet ensemble achieved comparable or superior SUV metric correlation performance to gold-standard data. Despite superior disease delineation performance, the nnUNet methods did not display superior prognostic power over other methods.Significance.This work showed that CNN-based (nnUNet) methods are superior to the non-CNN methods for mCRPC disease delineation in full-body18F-NaF PET/CT. The CNN-based methods, however, do not hold greater prognostic power for predicting clinical outcome.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 101 patients treated with enzalutamide for CRPC at our institution.

They are source of natural molecules which can induce apoptosis in cancer cells by affecting molecular mechanisms implicated in cancer progression. The MAP Kinase/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways are two classical signaling pathways implicated in cancer progression and constitute therapeutic targets against cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of euphol on MAP Kinase/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in glioblastoma and prostate cancer cells. Euphol is a tetracyclique triterpene alcohol isolated from Tapinanthus sp. which is a hemi parasitic plant belonging to Loranthaceae family.  Methods:   Plant powder was extracted by maceration and euphol was isolated and described using respectively column chromatography separation on silica gel and spectroscopic data. Cytotoxic effect of euphol was evaluated using XTT assay and its effect on MAP Kinase/ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT protein expression was investigated by Western immunoblot analysis. Apotosis was analyzed by evaluating caspase-3/7 activity.  Results:   Our investigations demonstrated that this compound has an important cytotoxic effect on C6 and U87 MG glioblastoma (GBM) cells and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, euphol-induced apoptosis revealed by elevated caspase 3/7 activity, was correlated with a significant inhibition of MAP kinase/Erk 1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in glioblastoma U87 MG cells. The reverse effect was observed in C6 glioblastoma cells, where apoptosis was correlated with a long-lasting activation of Erk 1/2. In PC-3 cells, euphol had no or limited effect on Erk 1/2 and Akt activity.

Secondarily, to integrate body composition as a factor to classify patients by risk of all-cause mortality.  Materials and methods:   Participants of NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9406 and NRG/RTOG 0126 with archived computed tomography were included. Muscle mass and muscle density were estimated by measuring the area and attenuation of the psoas muscles on a single slice at L4-L5. Bone density was estimated by measuring the attenuation of the vertebral body at mid-L5. Survival analyses, including Cox proportional hazards models, assessed the relationship between body composition and mortality. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to create a classification tree to classify participants by risk of death.  Results:   Data from 2066 men were included in this study. In the final multivariable model, psoas area, comorbidity score, baseline prostate serum antigen, and age were significantly associated with survival. The RPA yielded a classification tree with four prognostic groups determined by age, comorbidity, and psoas area. Notably, the classification among older (≥70 years) men into prognostic groups was determined by psoas area.  Conclusions:   This study strongly supports that body composition is related to mortality in men with localized PCa. The inclusion of psoas area in the RPA classification tree suggests that body composition provides additive information to age and comorbidity status for mortality prediction, particularly among older men. More research is needed to determine the clinical impact of body composition on prognostic models in men with PCa.""","""['Andrew M McDonald', 'Lyudmila DeMora', 'Eddy S Yang', 'John M Hoyle', 'Andrew Lenzie', 'Grant R Williams', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Don Yee', 'Jean-Paul Bahary', 'Robert B Den', 'Mack Roach rd', 'Robert Dess', 'Mark V Mishra', 'Richard K Valicenti', 'Harold Y Lau', 'Samuel R Marcrom', 'Luis Souhami', 'Lucas C Mendez', 'Yuhchyau Chen', 'Desiree E Doncals', 'Stephanie L Pugh', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Howard M Sandler']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['The importance of body composition in patients with prostate cancer receiving radiotherapy.', 'Molecular-Based Recursive Partitioning Analysis Model for Glioblastoma in the Temozolomide Era: A Correlative Analysis Based on NRG Oncology RTOG 0525.', 'CT Measures of Bone Mineral Density and Muscle Mass Can Be Used to Predict Noncancer Death in Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiotherapy and temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma: validation of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-Recursive Partitioning Analysis in the IMRT and temozolomide era.', 'Cardiovascular Mortality Following Short-term Androgen Deprivation in Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of RTOG 94-08.', 'Biochemical Failure Is Not a Surrogate End Point for Overall Survival in Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Analysis of NRG Oncology/RTOG 9601.']"""

Approximately 81% of PCa is diagnosed during the early stage of the disease. The treatment options for prostate care include surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, but these treatments often have side effects that may lead to issues such as impotence or decreased bowel function. Our central goal is to test the apoptotic effects of Vernonia amygdalina Delile (an edible medicinal plant that is relatively inexpensive, nontoxic, and virtually without side effects) for the prevention of PCa using human adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cells as a test model.  Methods:   To address our central goal, PC-3 cells were treated with Vernonia amygdalina Delile (VAD). Cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis were evaluated by Flow Cytometry assessment. Nucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.  Results:   Flow cytometry data showed that VAD induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 checkpoint and significantly upregulated caspase-3 in treated cells compared to the control cells. Agarose gel electrophoresis resulted in the formation of DNA ladders in VAD-treated cells.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a polyphenolic compound and the active ingredient in green tea, which is involved in modulating gene expression through epigenetic alterations. Previous studies have shown that EGCG at low concentrations reduces the expression of AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the LNCaP cell line of prostate cancer. In this study, the effect of higher EGCG concentrations on AR and PSA expression in LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was investigated.  Methods:   In this study, LNCaP prostate cancer cell line was used and after MTT test, concentrations of 40, 60 and 80 μg/mL EGCG were used for treatment. Then, the expression of AR and PSA genes was evaluated by RT-PCR. AR protein expression was also assessed by Western blotting.  Results:   The present study showed that treatment of LNCaPs cells by EGCG reduces cell proliferation. The IC50 value was 42.7 μg/mL under experimental conditions. It was also observed that EGCG at concentrations of 40 and 80 μg/mL increased the expression of AR and PSA (p<0.05).  Conclusions:   The present study showed that the effect of EGCG on AR expression was different at different concentrations, so that unlike previous studies, higher concentrations of EGCG (80 and 40 μg/mL) increased AR and PSA expression. It seems that due to the toxic effects of EGCG in high concentrations on cancer cells and the possibility of its effect on normal cells, more caution should be exercised in its use.""","""['Nadereh Bakhshandeh', 'Maryam Mohammadi', 'Parisa Mohammadi', 'Elahe Nazari', 'Mehdi Damchi', 'Sajad Khodabandelu', 'Hossein Mokhtari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Horm Mol Biol Clin Investig""","""['Epigallocatechin-3-gallate Enhances the Efficacy of MicroRNA-34a Mimic and MicroRNA-93 Inhibitor Co-transfection in Prostate Cancer Cell Line.', 'Suppression of androgen receptor signaling and prostate specific antigen expression by (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate in different progression stages of LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Divergent effect of liver X receptor agonists on prostate-specific antigen expression is dependent on androgen receptor in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'A novel regulation of PSMA and PSA expression by Q640X AR in 22Rv1 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Effect of a prodrug of the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate on the growth of androgen-independent prostate cancer in vivo.']"""

The aim of this study is to elucidate simple and reliable factors contributing to early recovery of urinary continence (UC) and to develop a prediction model for early continence recovery after robot-assisted laparoscopic non-nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy (non-NS RARP). A retrospective analysis of 212 consecutive patients who underwent non-NS RARP by a single surgeon was carried out. Early recovery of urinary continence was defined as using no pads or one security pad per day within 1 month. Preoperative membranous urethral length (MUL) was measured on MRI, and the urinary continence at the standing position (UCSP) after removal of the catheter was examined during cystourethrography 6 days after surgery. Multivariable analysis was performed to detect predictive and postoperative factors associated with early recovery of urinary continence. The early continence recovery rate was 56.1%. Multivariable analysis revealed that MUL ≥ 13 mm, UCSP, and age ≤ 67 were the independent factors for early continence recovery. Early recovery rates were 97.1% for good risk, 76.3% for intermediate risk, and 28.4% for poor risk when divided into three risk groups by the sum score of three independent factors. Preoperative MUL, UCSP, and age are independent predictors of early recovery of UC in non-NS RARP, and our simple prediction model with the combination of the three factors could be a useful tool in clinical practice.""","""['Takehisa Onishi', 'Sho Sekito', 'Shinya Kajiwara', 'Takuji Shibahara']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['A Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial Examining the Impact of the Retzius-sparing Approach on Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Use of preoperative factors including urodynamic evaluations and nerve-sparing status for predicting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: Nerve-sparing technique contributes to the reduction of postprostatectomy incontinence.', 'Significance of postoperative membranous urethral length and position of vesicourethral anastomosis for short-term continence recovery following robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Mechanisms by which the low complexity and intrinsically disordered primary transactivation domain (AF-1) of AR and AR-SVs regulate transcriptional programming in PCa remains poorly defined. Using omics, live and fixed fluorescent microscopy of cells, and purified AF-1 and AR-V7 recombinant proteins we show here that AF-1 and the AR-V7 splice variant form molecular condensates by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) that exhibit disorder characteristics such as rapid intracellular mobility, coactivator interaction, and euchromatin induction. The LLPS and other disorder characteristics were reversed by a class of small-molecule-selective AR-irreversible covalent antagonists (SARICA) represented herein by UT-143 that covalently and selectively bind to C406 and C327 in the AF-1 region. Interfering with LLPS formation with UT-143 or mutagenesis resulted in chromatin condensation and dissociation of AR-V7 interactome, all culminating in a transcriptionally incompetent complex. Biochemical studies suggest that C327 and C406 in the AF-1 region are critical for condensate formation, AR-V7 function, and UT-143's irreversible AR inhibition. Therapeutically, UT-143 possesses drug-like pharmacokinetics and metabolism properties and inhibits PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth. Our work provides critical information suggesting that clinically important AR-V7 forms transcriptionally competent molecular condensates and covalently engaging C327 and C406 in AF-1, dissolves the condensates, and inhibits its function.

This study aimed to assess the impact of multi-leaf collimator (MLC) widths (10 mm and 5 mm) on plan quality during the treatment of prostate cancer. Additionally, this study aimed to investigate the impact of the MLC mode of energy on the Agility flattening filter (FF), MLC Agility-free flattening filter (FFF), and MLCi2 for patients receiving hypofractionated radiotherapy. Two radiotherapy techniques; Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) and Volumetric Modulated Arc Radiotherapy (VMAT), were used in this research. In the present study, computed tomography simulations of ten patients (six plans per patient) with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were analyzed. Various dosimetric parameters were assessed, including monitor units, treatment delivery times, conformity, and homogeneity indices. To evaluate the plan quality, dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were estimated for each technique. The results demonstrated that the determined dosimetric parameters of planning target volume (PTV)p (such as D mean, conformity, and homogeneity index) showed greater improvement with MLC Agility FF and MLC Agility FFF than with MLCi2. Additionally, the treatment delivery time was reduced in the MLC Agility FF (by 31%) and MLC Agility FFF (by 10.8%) groups compared to the MLCi2 group. It is concluded that for both the VMAT and IMRT techniques, the smaller width (5 mm) MLCs revealed better planning target volume coverage, improved the dosimetric parameters for PTV, reduced the treatment time, and met the constraints for OARs.

Methods:   Monocentric prospective study from May 2021 to January 2022 of consecutive patients with suspected prostate cancer [elevated prostate specific antigen (PSA) level and/or abnormal digital rectal examination] undergoing TRUS-Bx. The 15-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-15), Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool (PDET) and short form of Male Sexual Health Questionnaire (MSHQ-EjD Short Form) were assessed before, one and three months after TRUS-Bx. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the risk of temporary post-biopsy erectile and/or ejaculatory dysfunctions. The statistical significance was set as p value < 0.05.  Results:   A total of 276 consecutive patients were included in the study. The median age, PSA and biopsy cores were 65 years (IQR 59-69), 7 ng/ml (IQR 5-9.7) and 16 (IQR 12-16), respectively. We compared the IIEF subdomains before TRUS-Bx vs. one or three months: the erectile function (EF) decreased after one month (p<0.001) but recovered after three months (p=0.833); the Orgasmic Function (OF), the Sexual Desire (SD), the Intercourse Satisfaction (IS), the Overall Satisfaction (OS), and Total IIEF decreased significantly after both one and three months compared to pre-biopsy values (p < 0.05). As for ejaculatory function (EjF), PDET, MSHQ-EjD Short Form 1, 2, 3 and MSHQ-EjD Short Form 4 scores decreased significantly after one month (p < 0.001), but they returned to pre-biopsy values after 3 months: p = 0.538, p = 0.071 and p = 0.098, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our study proved that EF, assessed through IIEF- 15, and ejaculatory function, assessed through PDET and MSHQ-EjD Short Form, were negatively affected by TRUS-Bx one month after the procedure and recovered after three months.

The patients included in the study were unsuitable for surgery or unwilling to receive external beam radiotherapy because they were afraid of the possible side effects of whole-gland therapies.  Methods:   This study included patients with a diagnosis of nonmetastatic PCa who underwent FLA using SoracteLiteTM system. Tissue ablation was performed at a fixed power of 5 W by the diode multichannel laser system EchoLaser X4 that uses laser light transmitted through optical fibres causing the target tissue to undergo irreversible thermal damage. Functional outcomes were evaluated with the International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) and 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) before the treatment and one year later.  Results:   Ten patients suffering non-metastatic PCa were included. Four decided upon a conservative treatment because of reduced performance status and for six patients the procedure was chosen electively. All patients underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at 3 and 12 months and eight out of ten patients underwent prostate biopsy at 6 months. Persistent disease was detected in 3 patients who underwent a second ablation. In these patients at the biopsy following the second ablation none harbored residual disease. At follow-up, no patient suffered urinary incontinence requiring the use of pads. No significant worsening in sexual potency measured with IIEF-5 (p = 0.356) or prostatic symptoms measured at IPSS (p = 0.462) were recorded comparing pre-treatment condition vs one-year follow-up. Compared with baseline, prostate-specific antigen was significantly reduced at one-year follow-up (3.7 ± 1.1 vs 7.9 ± 4.1 ng/mL; p = 0.008).

ETS Related gene (ERG), an oncogene located in chromosome 21q22.2, is involved in prostate cancer (PCa) by serine 2 (TMPRSS2), a protein encoded by TMPRSS2 gene. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical impact of PTEN loss and ERG rearrangement in terms of oncologic results in patients diagnosed with localized PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   Prospective data were collected from a total of 74 patients who underwent open radical retropubic prostatectomy for localized PCa and immunohistochemical study was performed in tissue samples. The primary antibodies for anti-ERG antibody as well as anti-PTEN antibody were obtained from DAKO. ERG was considered positive if at least 20% of the evaluated cells were stained at least with medium intensity. PTEN protein loss was considered when the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear staining was mild or entirely negative across > 10% of tumor cells.  Results:   Homogenous loss of PTEN was associated with higher clinical International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade (p = 0.018) while no statistical significant association was present regarding the presence of ERG rearrangement with either ISUPc or ISUPp. After a median follow up of 34 months, 24 patients developed biochemical recurrence. No statistical significant correlation of ERG status with biochemical recurrence was noted while PTEN was associated with biochemical recurrence development in a statistical significant way. Lastly the combination of PTEN loss with ERG rearrangement presence was detected more often in higher ISUPc and ISUPp as well as biochemical recurrence development, although in a non statistical significant way.  Conclusions:   Homogenous and heterogenous PTEN loss was associated with biochemical recurrence. No association of ERG and biochemical recurrence was noted.

Material and methods:   Patients with clinically localised prostate cancer, scheduled for radical retropubic prostatectomy, were allocated to undergo the operation under either general anaesthesia (GA) or under combined (epidural-spinal) (CESA) anaesthesia. Several parameters were recorded both preoperatively (medical history, biometric data, PSA, biopsy Gleason score) and postoperatively (blood pressure, heart rate, haemoglobin levels, operation time and total hospital stay). In addition, mean arterial pressure, change in heart rate, total blood loss, blood transfusions, SAS score, intravenous fluid administration and operation time were also noted down intraoperatively. Patient pain levels and total satisfaction were evaluated using appropriate questionnaires. At the 12-month follow-up, biochemical recurrence using PSA levels and urinary continence status were evaluated.  Results:   A total of 60 patients were included (30 in each group). Intraoperatively, mean MAP and heart rate change was higher in the GA group (MAP+7,46, HR+27) and mean SAS was higher in the CESA group (+0.93). The time needed for patients' recovery was faster (-3.5 min) and hospitalization was shorter for patients in the CESA group (-0.6 days). Intraoperative blood loss, time for induction and duration of operation were not significantly different. Mean postoperative drop of haemoglobin was greater in the GA group (+0.56) while blood transfusions, VAS pain scores and amount of intravenous fluids did not differ significantly between the two groups. No complications were reported. Patient satisfaction and urinary continence were comparable between the groups and there were no cases of biochemical recurrence.

Materials and methods:   One-hundred and fifty consecutive patients with intermediate-risk PCa, treated between 2009 and 2018 at a single center were included. Primary study outcome was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as absence of additional treatment, systemic progression or prostate cancer related death.  Results:   Thirty-seven (25%) patients underwent cryotherapy and 113 (75%) HIFU. Median age was 69 (IQR 62-72) years, with 36 (24%) presenting palpable disease on rectal examination, and median total PSA of 7.85 (IQR 5.75-10.62) ng/mL.

Purpose:   We evaluated the dosimetric efficacy of robust optimization for helical intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) planning in the presence of patient setup uncertainty and anatomical changes.  Methods:   Two helical IMRT plans for 10 patients with localized prostate cancer were created using either minimax robust optimization (robust plan) or a conventional planning target volume (PTV) margin approach (PTV plan). Plan robustness was evaluated by creating perturbed dose plans with setup uncertainty from isocenter shifts and anatomical changes due to organ variation. The magnitudes of the geometrical uncertainties were based on the patient setup uncertainty considered during robust optimization, which was identical to the PTV margin. The homogeneity index, and target coverage (TC, defined as the V100% of the clinical target volume), and organs at risk (OAR; rectum and bladder) doses were analyzed for all nominal and perturbed plans. A statistical t-test was performed to evaluate the differences between the robust and PTV plans.  Results:   Comparison of the nominal plans showed that the robust plans had lower OAR doses and a worse homogeneity index and TC than the PTV plans. The evaluations of robustness that considered setup errors more than the PTV margin demonstrated that the worst-case perturbed scenarios for robust plans had significantly higher TC while maintaining lower OAR doses. However, when anatomical changes were considered, improvement in TC from robust optimization was not observed in the worst-case perturbed plans.

A minority of PACs confer innate ADT resistance without prior hormonal treatment. The expression of HMWCK in PAC cells has not been studied. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathologic and genomic features of HMWCK-expressing PACs and the relationship to ADT resistance.  Methods:   A total of 469 PACs were studied for HMWCK expression (39 postradiotherapy, 57 post-ADT, 373 treatment-naïve PACs). Clinicopathologic correlations of the HMWCK expression with tumor grade groups, specific tumor morphologies, tumor stages and disease recurrence/persistence/progression were performed. Five HMWCK+ PACs were also sequenced for genetic alterations.  Results:   Thirty one of the 469 cases (6.6%) showed variable HMWCK+ PAC. The HMWCK+ PAC often focally presented in the tumor and vast majority were associated with high Gleason scores and unfavorable growth patterns (cribriform, comedo-necrosis, and intraductal carcinoma) as well as high tumor stages. A small percentage of the HMWCK+ PCA (2/31, 6.5%) presented with frank squamous histomorphology. Vast majority (22/31, 87%) had no history of prior ADT. The HMWCK+ PAC all displayed diminished to lost expression of AR/NKX3.1. Most of the cases progressed within 12 months of ADT or disease persisted despite ADT. Of the 5 HMWCK+ PACs subjected to gene sequencing, 4 presented with PTEN/PI3K/MAPK pathway alterations.  Conclusion:   The study demonstrated HMWCK+ PAC to be a novel type of innate ADT-resistant PAC. Overexpression of HMWCK in PAC can be potentially used as a surrogate biomarker for aggressive and innate hormone-refractory PACs.

In addition to regulating the acetylation levels of histone and non-histone proteins and gene transcription, HDAC inhibitors as antitumor drugs can also affect the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway in tumor cells. Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most heritable malignancies in which DDR pathway defects can be detected in a considerable proportion of cases. Such defects are more prevalent in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and are highly enriched in metastatic lesions. There is currently evidence that DDR pathway-deficient PCa is associated with high-risk biological behaviors and response sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy. Platinum-based drugs have been used in multiple clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of CRPC.  Methods:   This study evaluated the combined anticancer effect of (cisplatin) CDDP and the HDAC inhibitors vorinostat (SAHA) on three androgen-dependent cell lines PC-3, DU-145, and C4-2B in vitro. The efficacy and safety of SAHA combined with CDDP in the treatment of CRPC were further verified through animal experiments.  Results:   The combination of the two drugs increases cytotoxic effects by increasing DNA damage. Our results showed that the SAHA could not only reduce the expression of homologous recombinant repair proteins BRCA2, BRCA1, PARP1, and RAD51, but also decrease enzymes that Reduce the key enzymes of GSH biosynthesis, GSS and GCLC, and GSTP1 which can catalyze the binding of GSH to cisplatin. The intracellular GSH level also decreased with the increase of SAHA concentration, at the same time, the content of intracellular Pt element.  Conclusion:   The combination of CDDP and SAHA can produce synergistic anticancer effects in androgen-independent PCa cells in vitro and in vivo. Our results open up a new avenue for the effective treatment of CRPC. To optimize the chemotherapy regimen for patients with advanced PCa, it is necessary to further study the molecular mechanism of platinum drugs, HDAC inhibitors, and their combined action.""","""['Taihao Chang', 'Zhenpeng Lian', 'Shenfei Ma', 'Zhengxin Liang', 'Xudong Ma', 'Xiaodong Wen', 'Yanming Wang', 'Ranlu Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Validation of histone deacetylase 3 as a therapeutic target in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination treatment with docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors downregulates androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel small molecule hybrid of vorinostat and DACA displays anticancer activity against human hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer through dual inhibition of histone deacetylase and topoisomerase I.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Histone deacetylase inhibitors in castration-resistant prostate cancer: molecular mechanism of action and recent clinical trials.']"""
