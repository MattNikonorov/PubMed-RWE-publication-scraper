Objective:   The study's primary objective was to identify the role of RBAC in supporting cancer therapies.  Design:   The author designed an open study.  Participants:   Participants were 14 patients who are suffering from various type of malignancies.  Intervention:   BRM4 capsules-a commercially available, proprietary RBAC supplement-were administered.  Outcome measures:   The study measured circulating tumor cells (CTC) and tumor markers-the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and cancer antigens 125 (CA125) 15-3 (CA15-3), and 27-29 (CA27-29) for the relevant malignancy.  Results:   Twelve out of 14 participants completed the protocol, and two participants died during the study. Of the 12 participants completing the study, the CTC levels were reduced in 10, with a statistically significant difference between the testing at baseline and postintervention (P = .0047). The tumor markers of various malignancies decreased for nine out the 12 participants, and one participant experienced remission.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that the product can be an effective immunomodulator that can complement conventional cancer treatment.""","""['Fred Pescatore', 'Carmelo Prestano', 'Malka Kichikova']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Altern Ther Health Med""","""['The Health-Promoting Properties and Clinical Applications of Rice Bran Arabinoxylan Modified with Shiitake Mushroom Enzyme-A Narrative Review.', 'Cardiovascular, endothelial function, and immune markers in response to treatment with a polysaccharide in HIV+ adults in a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial.', 'RETRACTED ARTICLE: The Novel Effects of a Hydrolyzed Polysaccharide Dietary Supplement on Immune, Hepatic, and Renal Function in Adults with HIV in a Randomized, Double-Blind Placebo-Control Trial.', 'The Novel Effects of a Hydrolyzed Polysaccharide Dietary Supplement on Immune, Hepatic, and Renal Function in Adults with HIV in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Control Trial.', 'Shiitake dermatitis: a report of 3 cases and review of the literature.']"""

Expressed prostatic secretions in urine are a tumor proximal fluid that has received significant attention as a source of potential prostate cancer (PCa) biomarkers for use in liquid biopsy protocols. Standard EV isolation methods like differential ultracentrifugation (dUC) co-isolate protein contaminants that mask lower-abundance proteins in typical mass spectrometry (MS) protocols. Further complicating the analysis of expressed prostatic secretions, uromodulin, also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP), is present at high concentrations in urine. THP can form polymers that entrap EVs during purification, reducing yield. Disruption of THP polymer networks with dithiothreitol (DTT) can release trapped EVs, but smaller THP fibres co-isolate with EVs during subsequent ultracentrifugation. To resolve these challenges, we describe here a dUC method that incorporates THP polymer reduction and alkaline washing to improve EV isolation and deplete both THP and other common protein contaminants. When applied to human expressed prostatic secretions in urine, we achieved relative enrichment of known prostate and prostate cancer-associated EV-resident proteins.

The purpose of the present study was to examine incidence rates (2008-2017) and trends (1999-2017) for leading cancers in urban non-Hispanic AI/AN (NH AI/AN) compared to non-Hispanic White (NHW) populations living in the same urban areas.  Methods:   Incident cases from population-based cancer registries were linked with the Indian Health Service patient registration database for improved racial classification of NH AI/AN populations. This study was limited to counties in Urban Indian Health Organization service areas. Analyses were conducted by geographic region. Age-adjusted rates (per 100,000) and trends (joinpoint regression) were calculated for leading cancers.  Results:   Rates of colorectal, liver, and kidney cancers were higher overall for urban NH AI/AN compared to urban NHW populations. By region, rates of these cancers were 10% to nearly 4 times higher in NH AI/AN compared to NHW populations. Rates for breast, prostate, and lung cancer were lower in urban NH AI/AN compared to urban NHW populations. Incidence rates for kidney, liver, pancreatic, and breast cancers increased from 2% to nearly 7% annually between 1999 to 2017 in urban NH AI/AN populations.  Conclusions:   This study presents cancer incidence rates and trends for the leading cancers among urban NH AI/AN compared to urban NHW populations for the first time, by region, in the United States. Elevated risk of certain cancers among urban NH AI/AN populations and widening cancer disparities highlight important health inequities and missed opportunities for cancer prevention in this population.""","""['Stephanie C Melkonian', 'Melissa A Jim', 'Dornell Pete', 'Amy Poel', 'Adrian E Dominguez', 'Abigail Echo-Hawk', 'Stephanie Zhang', 'Reda J Wilson', 'Donald Haverkamp', 'Lindsey Petras', 'Ashley Pohlenz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Incidence of and Trends in the Leading Cancers With Elevated Incidence Among American Indian and Alaska Native Populations, 2012-2016.', 'Disparities in Cancer Incidence and Trends among American Indians and Alaska Natives in the United States, 2010-2015.', 'Disparities in Breast-Conserving Therapy for Non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native Women Compared with Non-Hispanic White Women.', 'Health Disparities in Cancer Among American Indians and Alaska Natives.', 'Maternal Mortality Among American Indian/Alaska Native Women: A Scoping Review.', 'Cancer Progress and Priorities: Gastric Cancer.']"""

We compared preclinical dosimetry and human biodistribution of 18F-rhPSMA-7 with that of single diastereoisomer form, 18F-rhPSMA-7.3.  Methods:   Preclinical dosimetry was performed with SCID-mice sacrificed at multiple timepoints (10-300 min) post-injection of 25.6 ± 3.6 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7 or 28.5 ± 4.8 MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 (n = 3-6 mice per timepoint). Heart, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, fat, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, kidney, muscle, bone, bladder, testicles, tail, and brain tissue were harvested, and urine and blood samples collected. Percentage of injected dose per gram was calculated. Absorbed doses were estimated with OLINDA/EXM 1.0. 18F-rhPSMA-7 (n = 47) and 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 (n = 33) PET/CT exams were used to estimate human biodistribution. Mean (range) injected activities were 324 (236-424) MBq versus 345 (235-420) MBq, and acquisition times were 84 (42-166) versus 76 (59-122) minutes for 18F-rhPSMA-7 versus 18F-rhPSMA-7.3, respectively. SUVmean was determined for background (gluteal muscle), normal organs (salivary glands, blood pool, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, duodenum, kidney, bladder, bone) and up to three representative tumour lesions. Qualitative analyses assessed image quality, non-specific blood pool activity, and background uptake in bone/marrow using 3/4-point scales.  Results:   Preclinical dosimetry revealed that at 3.5 h and 1 h bladder voiding intervals, the extrapolated total effective doses were 26.6 and 12.2 µSv/MBq for 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 21.7 and 12.8 µSv/MBq for 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 respectively. Human biodistribution of both agents was typical of other PSMA-ligands and broadly similar to each other; SUVmean were 16.9 versus 16.2 (parotid gland), 19.6 versus 19.9 (submandibular gland), 2.0 versus 1.9 (blood pool, p < 0.005), 0.7 versus 0.7 (lungs), 7.0 versus 7.3 (liver), 9.1 versus 8.4 (spleen), 32.4 versus 35.7 (kidney), 2.5 versus 2.8 (pancreas), 10.9 versus 11.0 (duodenum), 1.1 versus 1.3 (bone) and 4.6 versus 2.0 (bladder; p < 0.001) for 18F-rhPSMA-7 versus 18F-rhPSMA-7.3, respectively.

NK cells release extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing cytolytic proteins, indicating that NK-cell derived EVs may have therapeutic potential. In this study, we compared the tumor-targeting potential of EVs derived from either primary NK cells or the NK cell lines NK-92 and KHYG-1 cultured in IL-15 alone or in combination with IL-12 and IL-18. Primary NK cells were also stimulated through the activating receptor CD16. Tumor cell apoptosis was measured using a panel of human colon, melanoma, glioblastoma, prostate, breast, and ovarian tumor cell line spheroids. NK cells or NK-92 cells stimulated with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 generated EVs with higher efficiency than EVs from resting cells, although similar amounts of EVs were produced under both conditions. Proteomic analysis indicated similar distribution of cytolytic proteins in EVs from primary NK cells and NK-92, but lower levels in KHYG-1 EVs that translated into poor capacity for KHYG-1 EVs at targeting tumor cell lines. Further, we show that CD16-stimulated NK cells release low amounts of EVs devoid of cytolytic proteins. Importantly, EVs from cytokine-stimulated NK cells penetrate into the spheroid core, and tumor spheroid susceptibility to NK-cell derived EVs was linked to differential expression of the NKG2D ligands MICA/B, which was blocked with an anti-NKG2D antibody. We conclude that EVs from activated primary NK cells or NK-92 cells has the best potential to infiltrate and target solid tumors.""","""['Miriam Aarsund', 'Filip M Segers', 'Yunjie Wu', 'Marit Inngjerdingen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Immunol Immunother""","""['Natural Killer Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as a Promising Immunotherapeutic Strategy for Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Enhancement of antitumor potency of extracellular vesicles derived from natural killer cells by IL-15 priming.', 'Cytokine-enhanced cytolytic activity of exosomes from NK Cells.', 'Impact on NK cell functions of acute versus chronic exposure to extracellular vesicle-associated MICA: Dual role in cancer immunosurveillance.', 'Interleukin-18 synergism with interleukin-2 in cytotoxicity and NKG2D expression of human natural killer cells.', 'Research progress in leveraging biomaterials for enhancing NK cell immunotherapy.', 'In vitro models to study natural killer cell dynamics in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Opportunities and challenges of natural killer cell-derived extracellular vesicles.', 'Natural Killer Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles as a Promising Immunotherapeutic Strategy for Cancer: A Systematic Review.', 'Exosomal Communication Between the Tumor Microenvironment and Innate Immunity and Its Therapeutic Application.']"""

The cell division cycle-associated (CDCA) gene family plays vital roles in the cell cycle process, but an analysis of these proteins in PCa is still lacking.  Methods:   UALCAN and GEPIA were used to examine the transcriptional data and survival of the CDCA gene family in PCa patients. CDCA genetic alterations, prognostic value of genetic alterations, and correlations of CDCAs with each other in PCa were downloaded from cBioPortal. The functional enrichment data of CDCA-related genes were analyzed using DAVID.  Results:   Six CDCA genes were upregulated in PCa tissues relative to those in normal tissues (P < .001), including NUF2, CDCA2, CDCA3, CDCA5, CBX2, and CDCA8. The expression levels of the 6 CDCAs were related to the tumor Gleason score (P < .05). In addition, survival analysis using GEPIA suggested that PCa patients with increased NUF2, CBX2, and CDCA2/3/5/8 expression levels had poor relapse-free survival (P < .05). Distinct patterns of genetic alterations of the 6 CDCAs were observed in PCa, and pairwise comparison of the mRNA expression of the 6 CDCAs displayed a close relationship. The biological functions of CDCA-related genes are principally associated with the activation of the following pathways: cell cycle, Fanconi anemia pathway, microRNAs in cancer, oocyte meiosis, and homologous recombination.  Conclusions:   Upregulated CDCA (NUF2, CBX2, and CDCA2/3/5/8) expression in PCa tissues may play a crucial role in the occurrence of PCa. These CDCAs can predict relapse-free survival prognosis and the Gleason score of patients with PCa. Moreover, CDCAs probably exert their functions in tumorigenesis through the cell cycle and miRNAs in the cancer pathway.""","""['Peng Gu', 'Dongrong Yang', 'Jin Zhu', 'Minhao Zhang', 'Xiaoliang He']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Medicine (Baltimore)""","""['Integrate analysis of the promote function of Cell division cycle-associated protein family to pancreatic adenocarcinoma.', 'Analysis of the Expression of Cell Division Cycle-Associated Genes and Its Prognostic Significance in Human Lung Carcinoma: A Review of the Literature Databases.', 'Systematic Analysis of the Clinical Relevance of Cell Division Cycle Associated Family in Endometrial Carcinoma.', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified hub genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'MicroRNAs and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Pan-cancer analysis identifies CDCA3 as a novel prognostic marker associated with immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma through bioinformatics analysis.', 'An Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis towards the Identification of Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Predictive Key Biomarkers for Urinary Bladder Cancer.']"""

Point mutations such as T877A and W741L are frequently seen in advanced prostate cancer patients, conferring drug-resistance and hence driving cancer growth. Such occurrence of drug resistance in prostate cancer necessitates designing of suitable ligands to ensure better interactions with the receptors which can block the progression of the disease. The present study focus on the modification of plant-derived flavonoids that might act as inhibitors against such point mutations namely, T877A and W741L. In T877A mutation threonine is substituted by alanine at the 877 codon and W741L mutation, tryptophan is substituted by lysine at the 741 codon in prostate cancer. The study revolved on the aspect of the evaluation of Isobavachin and its derivatives as a potential agent to tackle such point mutations by using the in silico approach. A total of 98 molecular dockings were performed to find the ligand-receptor complexes with the lowest binding energy employing Autodock Software to conduct the blind and site-specific docking. Additionally, ligands were screened for Drug-likeness and toxicity using several tools yielding eight possible drug candidates. Based on the results of Molecular Docking, Drug-likeness, and ADMET testing, ten structures, including six complexes and three receptors were subjected to molecular dynamics simulation of 100 ns covering RMSD, RMSF, Rg, and MM/PBSA. Based on the simulation results, Isobavachin, IsoMod4, and IsoMod7 were concluded to be stable and exhibited potential properties for developing a novel drug to combat prostate cancer and its associated drug-resistance.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Secondary end points were enzalutamide and N-desmethyl enzalutamide (metabolite) plasma Cmax , AUC during a dosing interval, where tau is the length of the dosing interval (AUCtau ), and concentration immediately prior to dosing at multiple dosing (Ctrough ). When administered with enzalutamide, there was a 17% increase in Cmax , 29% increase in AUClast , and 33% increase in AUCinf of plasma digoxin compared to digoxin alone, indicating that enzalutamide is a ""mild"" inhibitor of P-gp.

This study investigated the effect of PMD-026 on YB-1/AR signaling and its antitumor effect in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Castration-resistant prostate cancer 22Rv1 cells that express high-level AR variants were used in this study. The effect of PMD-026 on YB-1/AR signaling was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis. The effects of PMD-026 on prostate cancer cells were investigated by cytotoxicity analysis, apoptosis assay, and cell cycle assay in vitro and a mouse castration model in vivo. PMD-026 decreased YB-1 phosphorylation as well as AR V7 mRNA and AR variant expressions in 22Rv1 cells. PMD-026 suppressed cell proliferation alone and in combination with the second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and darolutamide by inducing cellular apoptosis and G2/M arrest. In a mouse xenograft model, PMD-026 suppressed tumor growth, and the combination of PMD-026 and enzalutamide inhibited tumor growth more prominently than single treatments.

To date, catheter reconstruction during the clinical procedure is performed manually. Deep learning has been successfully applied to a wide variety of complex tasks and has the potential to tackle the unique challenges associated with multiple catheter localization on ultrasound. Such a task is well suited for automation, with the potential to improve productivity and reliability.  Purpose:   We developed a deep learning model for automated catheter reconstruction and investigated potential factors influencing model performance. The model was designed to integrate into a clinical workflow, with a proposed reconstruction confidence metric to aid in planner verification.  Methods:   Datasets from 242 patients treated from 2016 to 2020 were collected retrospectively. The anonymized dataset comprises 31,000 transverse images reconstructed from 3D sagittal ultrasound acquisitions and 3500 implanted catheters manually localized by the planner. Each catheter was retrospectively ranked based on the severity of imaging artifacts affecting reconstruction difficulty. The U-NET deep learning architecture was trained to localize implanted catheters on transverse images. A fivefold cross-validation method was used, allowing for evaluation over the entire dataset. The postprocessing software combined the predictions with patient-specific implant information to reconstructed catheters in 3D space, uniquely matched to the implanted grid positions. A reconstruction confidence metric was calculated based on the number and probability of localized predictions per catheter. For each patient, deep learning prediction and postprocessing reconstruction were completed in under 2 min on a nonperformance PC.  Results:   Overall, 80% of catheter reconstructions were accurate, within 2 mm along 90% of the length. The catheter tip was often not detected and required extrapolation during reconstruction. The reconstruction accuracy was 89% for the easiest catheter ranking and decreased to 13% for the highest difficulty ranking, when the aid of live ultrasound would have been recommended. Even when limited to the easiest ranked catheters, the reconstruction accuracy decreased at distal grid positions, down to 50%. Individual implantation style was found to influence the frequency of severe artifacts, slightly impacting the model accuracy. A reconstruction confidence metric identified the difficult catheters, removed the observed individual variation, and increased the overall accuracy to 91% while excluding 27% of the reconstructions.  Conclusions:   The deep learning model localized implanted catheters over a large clinical dataset, with overall promising results.

Herein, we tested the clinical utility of a 16 common variant-based polygenic risk score (PRS) that has been developed previously for Japanese men and also evaluated the frequency of PCa-associated rare variants in a prospective cohort of Japanese men undergoing prostate biopsy.  Methods:   A total of 1336 patients undergoing first prostate biopsy were included. PRS was calculated based on the genotype of 16 common variants, and sequencing of 8 prostate cancer-associated genes was performed by multiplex polymerase chain reaction based target sequencing. PRS was combined with clinical factors in logistic regression models to assess whether addition of PRS improves the prediction of biopsy positivity.  Results:   The top PRS decile was associated with an odds ratio of 4.10 (95% confidence interval = 2.46 to 6.86) with reference to the patients at average risk, and the estimated lifetime absolute risk approached 20%. Among the patients with prostate specific antigen 2-10 ng/mL who had prebiopsy magnetic resonance imaging, high PRS had an equivalent impact on biopsy positivity as a positive magnetic resonance imaging finding. Rare variants were detected in 19 (2.37%) and 7 (1.31%) patients with positive and negative biopsies, respectively, with BRCA2 variants being the most prevalent. There was no association between PRS and high-risk rare variants.

However, their functional and prognostic value has not been fully illustrated. Therefore, we used bioinformatics methods to further analyze the possible roles of E2F transcription factors in the development and progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We explored the expression levels of E2F transcription factors using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine database in paired and unpaired samples. The clinical correlation and prognostic value of E2F transcription factors were assessed. Using the R package ""pROC"", we judged the diagnostic value of E2F transcription factors. The online website tool cBioPortal was also employed to find possible gene alterations of E2F transcription factors in samples from TCGA. The R package ""clusterprofiler"" was used to conduct functional analysis. Moreover, we also used the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource to search for the associations between E2F transcription factors and the infiltration levels of 6 kinds of immune cells. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to validate the expression levels of E2F transcription factors in human paired prostate tissues.  Results:   E2F1/2/3/5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were higher in prostate cancer tissues than in normal tissues, while E2F4 and E2F6 mRNA expression levels were lower (P<0.05). All E2F transcription factors were associated with clinical parameters. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that E2F1/4/6/8 were notably associated with the overall survival of patients with prostate cancer (P<0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve results showed that except for E2F7, the other E2F transcription factors had diagnostic value for prostate cancer (P<0.05). We further found close associations between E2F transcription factors and the infiltration levels of immune cells. The results of quantitative real-time PCR were consistent with those from public databases.  Conclusions:   E2F transcription factor family members are differentially expressed in prostate cancer and are significantly related to the prognosis of patients, suggesting that they may be adopted as biomarkers for prognosis prediction and the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Decai Wang#', 'Wensen Tang#', 'Pingbao Zhang#', 'Zijian Liu', 'Fang Lyu', 'Yajun Xiao', 'Dong Ni', 'Pu Zhang']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Transl Cancer Res""","""['Differential Expression of E2F Transcription Factors and Their Functional and Prognostic Roles in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of the E2F Transcription Factor Family in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'A bioinformatics analysis for diagnostic roles of the E2F family in esophageal cancer.', 'Expressions and prognostic values of the E2F transcription factors in human breast carcinoma.', 'Analysis of the Expression of Cell Division Cycle-Associated Genes and Its Prognostic Significance in Human Lung Carcinoma: A Review of the Literature Databases.', 'Characterization of metabolism-associated molecular patterns in prostate cancer.', 'hMSH2 coordinated with the expression of E2F1 promotes platinum response in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Targeting E2F Sensitizes Prostate Cancer Cells to Drug-Induced Replication Stress by Promoting Unscheduled CDK1 Activity.', 'Differential Expression of E2F Transcription Factors and Their Functional and Prognostic Roles in Human Prostate Cancer.', 'A Novel Gene Signature Associated With ""E2F Target"" Pathway for Predicting the Prognosis of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Interventional image documentation was reviewed for rectoprostatic hematomas and rectal blood collections in this retrospective observational single-center study. Correlation to patient characteristics was analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. 283 consecutive patients with a mean age of 66 ± 8 years were included.

Intra-rectal blood collections were observed in 16 patients and one patient showed bleeding in the urinary bladder. The volume of rectoprostatic hematomas was determined with a median of 7.5 ml (range 2-40 ml, IQR 11.25). We found no correlation between the presence of a rectoprostatic hematoma and malignant findings, patient position in biopsy, number of cores, age, prostate volume nor PSA density (p > 0.05). Rectoprostatic hematomas and rectal blood collections are rare complications after in-bore MR-guided prostate biopsy.

Thus, there is growing recognition that preventing or delaying PC metastasis holds great potential for substantially improving patient outcomes. Here we show receptor-interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is a clinically actionable target for inhibiting PC metastasis. RIPK2 is amplified/gained in ~65% of lethal metastatic castration-resistant PC. Its overexpression is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis, and its genetic knockout substantially reduces PC metastasis. Multi-level proteomics analyses reveal that RIPK2 strongly regulates the stability and activity of c-Myc (a driver of metastasis), largely via binding to and activating mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 7 (MKK7), which we identify as a direct c-Myc-S62 kinase. RIPK2 inhibition by preclinical and clinical drugs inactivates the noncanonical RIPK2/MKK7/c-Myc pathway and effectively impairs PC metastatic outgrowth.

This has become especially pressing in the era of immune therapy, where toxicity can be long-lasting and life-altering, and primarily comes in the form of immune-related adverse effects (irAEs). Treatment with the first drugs in this class, anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1) checkpoint therapies, results in grade 2 or higher irAEs in up to 25%-30% of patients, which occur most commonly within the first 6 months of treatment and can include arthralgias, rash, pruritus, pneumonitis, diarrhea and/or colitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies. We tested the hypothesis that germline microRNA pathway functional variants, known to predict altered systemic stress responses to cancer therapies, would predict irAEs in patients across cancer types.  Methods:   MicroRNA pathway variants were evaluated for an association with grade 2 or higher toxicity using four classifiers on 62 patients with melanoma, and then the panel's performance was validated on 99 patients with other cancer types. Trained classifiers included classification trees, LASSO-regularized logistic regression, boosted trees, and random forests. Final performance measures were reported on the training set using leave-one-out cross validation and validated on held-out samples. The predicted probability of toxicity was evaluated for its association, if any, with response categories to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy in the melanoma cohort.  Results:   A biomarker panel was identified that predicts toxicity with 80% accuracy (F1=0.76, area under the curve (AUC)=0.82) in the melanoma training cohort and 77.6% accuracy (F1=0.621, AUC=0.778) in the pan-cancer validation cohort. In the melanoma cohort, the predictive probability of toxicity was not associated with response categories to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy (p=0.70). In the same cohort, the most significant biomarker of toxicity in RAC1, predicting a greater than ninefold increased risk of toxicity (p<0.001), was also not associated with response to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy (p=0.151).  Conclusions:   A germline microRNA-based biomarker signature predicts grade 2 and higher irAEs to anti-PD1/PDL1 therapy, regardless of tumor type, in a pan-cancer manner.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is the central component of advanced PCa treatment, causes side effects. The goal of this study was to examine the metabolic changes and bioelectrical impedance analysis differences in PCa patients who received ADT.  Materials and methods:   After age-related match-pair analysis, a total of 519 patients with PCa and control group who had benign disease were enrolled in the study. Biochemical blood parameters and TANITA measurements were recorded for all patients. Patients were categorized into three groups, ADT group (Group 1, n=124) and non-ADT group (Group 2, n=248), control group (Group 3, n=147).  Results:   The mean age of groups was similar. Body mass index, waist circumference, body fat mass and fat ratio, which were among the TANITA parameters, were higher in group 1 (p<0.05). Total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein, non- high density lipoprotein, triglycerids and fasting blood glucose values were also higher in group 1 (p<0.05). Myocardial infarction and metabolic syndrome rates were also higher in this group.  Conclusions:   While the use of ADT is manifested by an increase in fat mass and fat ratio in body composition, it negatively affects waist circumference measurements. It is associated with metabolically unfit body composition changes that predispose to diabetes mellitus and may increase cardio-vascular disease.

Objective:   To determine and quantify the utility of perilesional biopsies in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   Participants were 2048 men with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions (grades 3-5) who underwent targeted and systematic prostate biopsy via MRI/ultrasound fusion at University of California Los Angeles and Cornell between 2011 and 2019. The study is a retrospective examination of prospectively acquired data.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All biopsy cores (30191), locations of which had been stored digitally in the image-fusion device, were analyzed for tissue pathology and relationship with MRI lesions. A validated Matlab script was used to determine the distance between MRI lesions and cores containing csPCa (3552 cores from 927 men). Significance of distance measurements was determined by multilevel, multivariable logistic regression to account for within patient-biopsy correlation and control for patient characteristics.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 90% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 89-91) of csPCa cores (3206/3552) were located within a radius of 10 mm from the nearest lesion: 65% (95% CI = 63-67) within the region of interest (ROI) and 26% (95% CI = 24-27) outside the ROI but within the 10-mm ""penumbra."" The width of the penumbra or concentric band, which enclosed 90% of csPCa, was primarily related to MRI grade of lesion: grade 5, 5 mm; grade 4, 12 mm; grade 3, 16 mm. In 18% (95% CI = 15-20) of patients (166/927), csPCa was diagnosed only by sampling outside the MRI lesion, the yield decreasing with increasing distance. Limitations of MRI interpretation and fusion biopsy performance could affect the utility of these data in individual patients.  Conclusions:   Perilesional biopsies, that is, samples taken from a band of 10-mm radius outside MRI lesions (the penumbra), contain most cores of csPCa that are not present within the lesion. These data may help increase the performance characteristics of targeted prostate biopsy.  Patient summary:   We studied the locations of cancer within the prostate in men undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided biopsy. We found that not all cancers are located within the MRI lesion, but 90% (95% confidence interval = 89-91) of the cancers arewithin 1 cm of the lesions.

S100A2 is a Ca2+ binding protein with implications in cell signaling and is known to be upregulated in pancreatic cancer. It is a validated pancreatic cancer drug target. Lead 1, inhibited the growth of the MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cell line (GI50 = 2.97 μM). Focused compound libraries were developed to explore the SAR of this compound class with 4 libraries and 43 compounds total. Focused library (Library 1) development identified lipophillic sulfonamides as preferred for MiaPaCa-2 activity, with -CF3 and -C(CH3)3 substituents well tolerated (MiaPaCa-2 GI50 < 6 μM). Contraction of the hexylamino spacer to ethyl (Library 2) and propyl (Library 3) proved beneficial to activity against a broad spectrum panel of cancer cell lines: HT29 (lung), MCF-7 (breast), A2780 (ovarian), H460 (colon), A431 (skin), Du145 (prostate), BE2-C (neuroblastoma), U87 and SJ-G2 (glioblastoma) (cohort-1); and a pancreatic cancer cell line panel: MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, AsPC-1, Capan-2, HPAC and PANC-1 (cohort-2). With a marked preference for a propyl linker the observed GI50 values ranged from 1.4 to 30 μM against cohort-1 and 1.4-30 μM against cohort-2 cell lines. In Library 4 the terminal aromatic moiety was explored with 4-substituted analogues preferred (with activity of 48 (4-Cl) > 47 (3-Cl) > 46 (2-Cl)) against the cell lines examined.

Naturally occurring variation in genes encoding antihypertensive drug targets can be used as proxies for these targets to examine the effect of their long-term therapeutic inhibition on disease outcomes.  Methods and findings:   We performed a mendelian randomization analysis to examine the association between genetically proxied inhibition of 3 antihypertensive drug targets and risk of 4 common cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ACE, ADRB1, and SLC12A3 associated (P < 5.0 × 10-8) with systolic blood pressure (SBP) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were used to proxy inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), β-1 adrenergic receptor (ADRB1), and sodium-chloride symporter (NCC), respectively. Summary genetic association estimates for these SNPs were obtained from GWAS consortia for the following cancers: breast (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls), colorectal (58,221 cases, 67,694 controls), lung (29,266 cases, 56,450 controls), and prostate (79,148 cases, 61,106 controls). Replication analyses were performed in the FinnGen consortium (1,573 colorectal cancer cases, 120,006 controls). Cancer GWAS and FinnGen consortia data were restricted to individuals of European ancestry. Inverse-variance weighted random-effects models were used to examine associations between genetically proxied inhibition of these drug targets and risk of cancer. Multivariable mendelian randomization and colocalization analyses were employed to examine robustness of findings to violations of mendelian randomization assumptions. Genetically proxied ACE inhibition equivalent to a 1-mm Hg reduction in SBP was associated with increased odds of colorectal cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1.13, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.22; P = 3.6 × 10-4). This finding was replicated in the FinnGen consortium (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.92; P = 0.035). There was little evidence of association of genetically proxied ACE inhibition with risk of breast cancer (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.02, P = 0.35), lung cancer (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.10; P = 0.93), or prostate cancer (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.13; P = 0.08). Genetically proxied inhibition of ADRB1 and NCC were not associated with risk of these cancers. The primary limitations of this analysis include the modest statistical power for analyses of drug targets in relation to some less common histological subtypes of cancers examined and the restriction of the majority of analyses to participants of European ancestry.  Conclusions:   In this study, we observed that genetically proxied long-term ACE inhibition was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, warranting comprehensive evaluation of the safety profiles of ACE inhibitors in clinical trials with adequate follow-up. There was little evidence to support associations across other drug target-cancer risk analyses, consistent with findings from short-term randomized controlled trials for these medications.""","""['James Yarmolinsky', 'Virginia Díez-Obrero', 'Tom G Richardson', 'Marie Pigeyre', 'Jennifer Sjaarda', 'Guillaume Paré', 'Venexia M Walker', 'Emma E Vincent', 'Vanessa Y Tan', 'Mireia Obón-Santacana', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Jochen Hampe', 'Andrea Gsur', 'Heather Hampel', 'Rish K Pai', 'Mark Jenkins', 'Steven Gallinger', 'Graham Casey', 'Wei Zheng', 'Christopher I Amos;International Lung Cancer Consortium;PRACTICAL consortium;MEGASTROKE consortium;George Davey Smith', 'Richard M Martin', 'Victor Moreno']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Genetically proxied glucose-lowering drug target perturbation and risk of cancer: a Mendelian randomisation analysis.', 'Association between genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition and prostate cancer risk: A Mendelian randomisation study.', 'Association Between Genetically Proxied Inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'The evolution of mendelian randomization for investigating drug effects.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Association of antihypertensive drugs with fracture and bone mineral density: A comprehensive drug-target Mendelian randomization study.', 'Genetically proxied therapeutic prolyl-hydroxylase inhibition and cardiovascular risk.']"""

Patients and methods:   The clinical data of 322 patients newly diagnosed with PCa following transrectal prostate biopsy at our hospital from October 2016 to March 2021 were analyzed. According to the results of whole-body bone emission computed tomography (ECT) scanning, patients were divided into the following two groups: bone metastasis group (BMT) and none-bone metastasis group (None-BMT). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the BMT-related factors associated with PCa. A receiver operating characteristic curve was also used to compare the diagnostic value of total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA), prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), Gleason score and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) for prostate cancer bone metastasis (PCBM).  Results:   The results revealed that the incidence of BMT in newly diagnosed patients with PCa was ~22.05% (71/322). Univariate analysis demonstrated that Gleason score, clinical T stage, TPSA, PSAD and ALP were associated with PCBM (p<0.001). Furthermore, the results of multivariate regression analysis revealed that TPSA, PSAD, Gleason score and ALP were independent risk factors for BMT (p <0.05). The cutoff values for TPSA, PSAD, ALP and Gleason score were 39.58 ng/ml, 1.489 ng/(ml/cm3), 93.15 U/l and 7.5, respectively. Additionally, the respective sensitivities for TPSA, PSAD, ALP and Gleason score were 67.6, 62.0, 57.7 and 46.5%, and the respective specificities were 88.4, 98.0, 100 and 98.8%.  Conclusions:   The current study determined that TPSA, PSAD, Gleason score and ALP were predictors of PCBM.

This study aimed to clarify the incidence of MRONJ and the corresponding survival rate of patients treated with zoledronic acid (ZA) for each type of cancer and obtain useful information for the oral/dental supportive care of cancer patients.  Methods:   We evaluated 988 patients who were administered ZA at our hospital; among them, 862 patients with metastatic bone tumors or myeloma were included.  Results:   The median survival time (MST) after ZA initiation was 35, 34, 8, 41, 12, and 6 months for patients with breast, prostrate, lung, myeloma, renal, and other cancers, respectively. Patients with cancers that had a short survival time (lung and other cancers [MST = 8 and 6 months, respectively] and cancers with MST < 10 months) did not develop MRONJ; this could be attributed to the shorter duration of ZA administration. The cumulative incidence of MRONJ in breast cancer, prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma was related to the frequency of anti-resorptive drug use and the increased risk over time. In renal cancer, the cumulative incidence of MRONJ increased early, although the MST was 12 months.

Materials and methods:   Thirty patients were advised to maintain full BV prior to computed tomography (CT) simulation and daily treatment. Among these, the BV of 15 patients was measured using Lilium until a BV of 80% in the simulation was achieved (with the Lilium group). Daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) was performed for treatment. The correlation between BV measured by CBCT and Lilium was assessed. The differences in the BV and dosimetric parameters of the bladder in the CBCT versus planning CT were compared between the groups with and without Lilium.  Results:   There was a significantly strong relationship (r = 0.796, p < 0.05) between the BVs measured using CBCT and Lilium. The relative BV ratios to simulation CT < 0.5 and > 2 were observed in 10.3% and 12.7%, respectively, of treatment sessions without Lilium group, while these ratios were 1% and 2.8%, respectively, in the Lilium group. The mean absolute difference in the range of V30Gy to V40Gy without Lilium sessions was significantly larger (p < 0.05) than that in the Lilium group.

Different carcinoma- and non-carcinoma cells were exposed to various concentrations of omega-3 compounds at varying exposure times and the cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay. The mechanism of Dido-induced apoptosis was investigated in prostate carcinoma cells. Dido induced stronger cytotoxicity than DHA in human prostate carcinoma cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Dido was also more selective and potent in inducing cytotoxicity in prostate carcinoma cells than other carcinoma cell lines tested. Pre-treatment with Dido increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in prostate carcinoma cells. Pre-treatment with various antioxidants reduced the cytotoxicity induced by Dido. Pre-treatment with Dido ≥30 ​μM also induced apoptosis which was suggested to involve an externalisation of phosphatidyl serine, a significant increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential (p ​< ​0.01) and the level of activated caspase 3/7 (p ​< ​0.05) in prostate carcinoma cells. This study is the first to show that Dido induced cytotoxicity with high selectivity and higher potency than DHA in human prostate carcinoma cells. The mechanism of action is likely to involve an increase in the level of ROS, loss in the mitochondrial membrane potential as well as externalisation of phosphatidyl serine and increase in the caspase 3/7 activity.

We prospectively evaluated weight change in adulthood and incident colorectal adenoma.  Methods:   We assessed weight change during early-late (age 20 years to baseline, ie, ages 55-74 years), early-middle (20-50 years), and middle-late (50 years-baseline) adulthood using self-reported weight data in relation to incident distal adenoma in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (cases = 1053; controls = 16 576). For each period, we defined stable weight as greater than -0.5 kg to less than or equal to 1 kg/5 years, weight loss as less than or equal to -0.5 kg/5 years, and weight gain as greater than 1-2, greater than 2-3, or greater than 3 kg/5 years. We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using logistic regression; all tests were 2-sided.  Results:   Compared with stable weight, weight loss during early-late adulthood was associated with reduced adenoma risk (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.34 to 0.86), particularly among those who were overweight or obese at age 20 years (OR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.84). Results were similar for early-middle adulthood but less pronounced for middle-late adulthood. Weight gain greater than 3 kg/5 years during early-late adulthood was associated with increased risk (OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.58, P trend < .001).

It is necessary to uncover the factors associated with patent's decision in taking cancer surgery and explore racial/ethnic disparities in surgery refusal.  Methods:   Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-18 program, we extracted data of non-metastatic cancer patients who didn't undergo surgery. Ten common solid cancers were selected. Four racial/ethnic categories were included: White, black, Hispanic, and Asian/Pacific Islander (API). Primary outcome was patient's refusal of surgery. Multivariable logistic regression models were used, with reported odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).  Results:   Among 318,318 patients, the incidence of surgery refusal was 3.5%. Advanced age, female patients, earlier cancer stage, uninsured/Medicaid and unmarried patients were significantly associated with higher odds of surgery refusal. Black and API patients were more likely to refuse recommended surgery than white patients in overall cancer (black-white: adjusted OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26; API-white: adjusted OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.41-1.72); those racial/ethnic disparities narrowed down after additionally adjusting for insurance type and marital status. In subgroup analysis, API-white disparities in surgery refusal widely existed in prostate, lung/bronchus, liver, and stomach cancers.  Conclusions:   Patient's socioeconomic conditions reflected by insurance type and marital status may play a key role in racial/ethnic disparities in surgery refusal.

This phase I/II trial assessed the safety, pharmacokinetic impact, and efficacy of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist mifepristone in combination with enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Patients and methods:   One hundred and six patients with CRPC were accrued. Phase I subjects were treated with enzalutamide monotherapy at 160 mg per day for 28 days to allow steady-state accumulation. Patients then entered the dose escalation combination portion of the study. In phase II, patients were randomized 1:1 to either receive enzalutamide alone or enzalutamide plus mifepristone. The primary endpoint was PSA progression-free survival (PFS), with radiographic PFS, and PSA response rate (RR) as key secondary endpoints. Circulating tumor cells were collected before randomization for exploratory translational biomarker studies.  Results:   We determined a 25% dose reduction in enzalutamide, when added to mifepristone, resulted in equivalent drug levels compared with full-dose enzalutamide and was well tolerated. However, the addition of mifepristone to enzalutamide following a 12-week enzalutamide lead-in did not delay time to PSA, radiographic or clinical PFS. The trial was terminated early due to futility.  Conclusions:   This is the first prospective trial of dual AR-GR antagonism in CRPC.

Design:   A single cohort study, guided by the RE-AIM framework.  Setting:   Multiple health services in Australia.  Participants:   Men with prostate cancer and their carers, and health professionals.  Intervention:   A 12-month telehealth programme that provided centralised and coordinated decision and information support, exercise and nutrition management, specialised clinical support and practical support to men and their carers.  Data collection:   Multiple sources of data including participant-reported health outcomes and experience of care, qualitative interviews, records of the programme were collected at different time points.  Results: Reach: Of 394 eligible men at various stages of survivorship, 142 consented (36% consent rate) and 136 (96%) completed the programme. Adoption: All men participated in general care coordination and more than half participated in exercise and/or nutrition management interventions. Participation in the specialised support component (ie, psychosocial and sexual health support, continence management) was low despite the high level of need reported by men. Effectiveness: Overall, the men reported improvements in their experience of care. Implementation: Factors such as addressing service gaps, provision of specialised services, care coordination, adoption of needs-based and telehealth-based approaches were identified as enablers to the successful implementation of the programme. Issues such as insufficient integration with existing services, lack of resources and high caseload of the intervention team, men's reluctance to discuss needs and lack of confidence with technology were barriers in implementing the programme.

Prostate cancer gene expression marker 1 (PCGEM1) is a lncRNA specifically expressed within the prostate and overexpressed in many cancer cells. Numerous studies have shown that PCGEM1 promotes cell proliferation, invasion and migration. However, the specific mechanism of PCGEM1 within prostate cancer (PCa) has not been elucidated. MicroRNA-506-3p (miR-506-3p) is a noncoding RNA, and studies have indicated that miR-506-3p is downregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and functions as a tumor suppressor.  Methods:   The TCGA (GEPIA) database ( http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/ ) was employed to measure PCGEM1 levels in PCa. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the PCGEM1 gene level. CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8) and colony formation assays were used to detect cell proliferation, and Transwell assays were applied to assess cell invasion and migration. The interacting ability of miR-506-3p with PCGEM1 or TRIAP1 was validated through a dual-luciferase reporter assay. TRIAP1 protein expression was detected by Western blotting.  Results:   PCGEM1 expression was increased in PCa tissues and cells. In PCa tissues, High PCGEM1 expression was associated with high Gleason score, distant metastasis and extracapsular extension. In addition, PCGEM1 knockdown inhibited PCa cell (C4-2B and PC-3) proliferation, invasion and migration. miR-506-3p may interact with PCGEM1 or TRIAP1, and the suppressive effect of PCGEM1 knockdown was reversed when TRIAP1 or a miR-506-3p inhibitor was cotransfected.

We aimed to investigate associations between anticoagulation duration and risks of VTE recurrence after treatment cessation and major on-treatment bleeding in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.  Methods:   Using nationwide prostate cancer registry and prescribing data, we followed 1413 men with VTE and an outpatient anticoagulant prescription following prostate cancer diagnosis. Men were followed to identify cases of recurrent VTE, and hospitalized major bleeding. We calculated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to quantify the association between anticoagulation duration (reference ≤ 3 months) and recurrent VTE using Cox regression. We estimated 1-year cumulative incidences of major bleedings from anticoagulation initiation.  Results:   The outpatient anticoagulation prescribed was parenteral (64%), direct oral anticoagulant (31%), and vitamin K antagonist (20%). Median duration of anticoagulation was 7 months. Adjusted HRs (95% CI) for off-treatment recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) were 0.32 (0.09-1.15) for > 3-6 months' duration, 0.21 (0.06-0.69) for > 6-9 months and 0.16 (0.05-0.55) for > 9 months; corresponding HRs for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were 0.67 (0.27-1.66), 0.80 (0.31-2.07), and 1.19 (0.47-3.02). One-year cumulative incidences of intracranial, gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeding were 0.9%, 1.7%, 3.0% during treatment, and 1.2%, 0.9%, 1.6% after treatment cessation.

This study aimed to investigate the potential ofrange guidanceusing water-equivalent path length (WEPL) calculations to detect dose degradations occurring in PT.Materials and methods. Proton ranges were estimated using WEPL calculations. Field-specific isodose surfaces in the planning CT (pCT), from robustly optimised five-field proton plans (opposing lateral and three posterior/posterior oblique beams) for locally advanced prostate cancer patients, were used as starting points. WEPLs to each point on the field-specific isodoses in the pCT were calculated. The corresponding range for each point was found in the repeat CTs (rCTs). The spatial agreement between the resulting surfaces in the rCTs (hereafter referred to as iso-WEPLs) and the isodoses re-calculated in rCTs was evaluated for different dose levels and Hausdorff thresholds (2-5 mm). Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting target dose degradation (V95% < 95%) using spatial agreement measures between the iso-WEPLs and isodoses in the pCT was evaluated.Results. The spatial agreement between the iso-WEPLs and isodoses in the rCTs depended on the Hausdorff threshold. The agreement was 65%-88% for a 2 mm threshold, 83%-96% for 3 mm, 90%-99% for 4 mm, and 94%-99% for 5 mm, across all fields and isodose levels. Minor differences were observed between the different isodose levels investigated. Target dose degradations were detected with 82%-100% sensitivity and 75%-80% specificity using a 2 mm Hausdorff threshold for the lateral fields.Conclusion. Iso-WEPLs were comparable to isodoses re-calculated in the rCTs. The proposed strategy could detect target dose degradations occurring in the rCTs and could be an alternative to a fully-fledged dose re-calculation to detect anatomical variations severely influencing the proton range.""","""['Kia Busch', 'Andreas G Andersen', 'Jørgen B B Petersen', 'Stine E Petersen', 'Heidi S Rønde', 'Lise Bentzen', 'Sara Pilskog', 'Peter Skyt', 'Ole Nørrevang', 'Ludvig P Muren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""['Evaluating the influence of organ motion during photon vs. proton therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer using biological models.', 'Degradation of target coverage due to inter-fraction motion during intensity-modulated proton therapy of prostate and elective targets.', 'Beam angle evaluation to improve inter-fraction motion robustness in pelvic lymph node irradiation with proton therapy.', 'A method for evaluation of proton plan robustness towards inter-fractional motion applied to pelvic lymph node irradiation.', 'Beam angle optimization using angular dependency of range variation assessed via water equivalent path length (WEPL) calculation for head and neck proton therapy.', 'Proton therapy planning and image-guidance strategies within a randomized controlled trial for high-risk prostate cancer.']"""

To address this question, we performed functional and synthetic lethal screens in four prostate cancer cell lines. These screens confirmed key roles for HSP70, HSP90, and their co-chaperones, but also suggested that the mitochondrial chaperone, HSP60/HSPD1, is selectively required in CRPC cell lines. Knockdown of HSP60 does not impact the stability of androgen receptor (AR) or its variants; rather, it is associated with loss of mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity, partly owing to increased proton leakage.

NPM1 is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein that participates in the development of multiple tumours.

Prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines were used in this study, including RWPE-1, PC3, LNCap, and 22RV1 cells. Our research revealed that NPM1 was widely expressed in the PRAD cell lines, as determined by western blotting, and that the levels of NPM1 protein were positively correlated with the degree of malignancy of the PRAD cell lines. Through interference and overexpression experiments, we found that PC3 cell growth was inhibited after NPM1 knockdown and that this inhibition was partly reversed by CTNNB1 overexpression; in contrast, PC3 cells growth was promoted after NPM1 overexpression, and this promotion was partly reversed by CTNNB1 knockdown, suggesting that NPM1 and CTNNB1 play important roles in the progression of prostate cancer cells via the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway.

Methods:   Taking 98 as the GNRI boundary value, 96 PCa patients (aged≥65 y) undergoing LRP in the Department of Urology, Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College from January 2018 to December 2020 were grouped into malnutrition group (MNg, 34 patients, 35.4%) and normal nutrition group (NNg, 62 patients, 64.6%). Basic information, laboratory examination indexes, operation conditions, postoperative complications and postoperative recovery indexes of patients were recorded and retrospectively analyzed. Clavien-Dindo Classification System (CDCS) was used to assess postoperative complications. T-test was used to analyze differences between the two groups. ROC curve was generated to determine the predictive value of GNRI for postoperative complications.  Results:   Percentage of complications was significantly higher in MNg group compared with that in NNg group (P < 0.01). The average grade based on CDCS was significantly lower in NNg group compared with that in MNg group (P < 0.01). Body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), preoperative hemoglobin value (HGB), serum albumin (ALB) values of MNg and NNg were significantly positively correlated with GNRI (P<0.01). Incidence and severity of postoperative complications of MNg patients were significantly higher compared with those of NNg patients (P<0.05).

The Patient-overview Prostate Cancer (PPC) presents clinical information in a graphical overview. The aim of this study was to measure time spent on retrieving clinical information in PPC compared to EHRs, to assess if retrieved data was correct and to explore usability of PPC.  Material and methods:   Oncologists, urologists and nurses in three hospitals in Sweden were timed when filling out questionnaires about patients using PPC and two different EHRs; Melior and COSMIC. Time and number of errors were analysed using linear mixed models (LMMs). Usability of PPC was measured with the System Usability Scale.  Results:   The LMM showed a significantly shorter time to retrieve information in PPC compared to EHRs. The estimated time to complete one questionnaire was 8 minutes (95% CI = 6-10, p < 0.001) in PPC compared to 25 minutes in Melior and 21 minutes in COSMIC. Compared to PPC, the estimated time difference was 17 minutes longer in Melior (95% CI = 14-20, p < 0.001) and 13 minutes longer in COSMIC (95% CI = 10-17, p < 0.001). The LMM showed significantly fewer errors in PPC compared to Melior. No significant difference in the number of errors was found between PPC and COSMIC. The usability of PPC was rated as excellent by oncologists, urologists and nurses.

When used in patients, this should prevent rectal damage during PTT, thereby achieving maximum treatment efficacy while ensuring safety, using a technology platform suitable for wide dissemination.  Aim:   We aim to validate that TRDOT measurements analyzed using a shape-based image-reconstruction algorithm (SBDOT) allow localization of the photocoagulation boundary during PTT within ±1 mm toward the rectum in the transverse plane.  Approach:   TRDOT measurements were performed in tissue-simulating phantoms, ex vivo tissues, and an in vivo canine prostate model. The accuracy and sensitivity of reconstructing the size and location of the coagulation zone were determined, based on changes in the tissue absorption and reduced scattering coefficients upon photocoagulation. The reconstruction also yields the native and coagulated tissue optical properties.  Results:   The TRDOT measurements and SBDOT reconstruction algorithm were confirmed to perform sufficiently well for clinical translation in PTT monitoring, recovering the location of the coagulation boundary within ±1 mm compared to the true value as determined by direct visualization postexcision and/or MRI.

Methods:   We used a population-based cohort of patients from the state-wide Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Data Set (VRMDS) who received RT for BM between 2012 and 2017. The primary outcome was proportion of RT courses using advanced RT techniques. The Cochran-Armitage test for trend was used to evaluate temporal trend in advanced RT use. Multinomial logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with advanced RT use.  Results:   A total of 18,158 courses of RT were delivered to 10,956 patients-16,626 (91.6%) courses were 3D conformal RT, 857 (4.7%) IMRT/VMAT and 675 (3.7%) SBRT. There was a sharp increase in IMRT/VMAT use from <1% in 2012-2015, to 10.1% in 2016 and 16.3% in 2017 (P-trend < 0.001). Increase in SBRT use was more gradual, from 1.2% in 2012 to 4.8% in 2016 and 5.5% in 2017 for SBRT (P-trend<0.001). In multivariate analyses, year of RT was the strongest predictor of IMRT/VMAT use (OR = 41; 95%CI = 25-67; P < 0.001, comparing 2012-2013 and 2016-2017). Primary tumour type (prostate cancer) was the strongest predictor of SBRT use (OR = 6.07; 95% CI = 4.19-8.80; P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Overall, there was increasing trend in the use of advanced RT techniques for BM in Victoria, with a distinct pattern for IMRT/VMAT compared with SBRT - SBRT uptake was more gradual while IMRT/VMAT uptake was abrupt, occurring contemporaneously with Medicare Benefit Scheme funding changes in 2016.""","""['Tamara Fogarty', 'Mark Tacey', 'Giulia McCorkell', 'David Kok', 'Colin Hornby', 'Roger L Milne', 'Jeremy Millar', 'Farshad Foroudi', 'Wee Loon Ong']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Volumetric arc intensity-modulated therapy for spine body radiotherapy: comparison with static intensity-modulated treatment.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy planning with duodenal sparing using volumetric-modulated arc therapy vs intensity-modulated radiation therapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer: a dosimetric analysis.', 'Treatment plan quality and delivery accuracy assessments on 3 IMRT delivery methods of stereotactic body radiotherapy for spine tumors.', 'A review of stereotactic body radiotherapy - is volumetric modulated arc therapy the answer?', 'Advances in Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'Large variation in radiation therapy fractionation for multiple myeloma in Australia.', 'Evaluation of Patient-Reported Outcome Differences by Radiotherapy Techniques for Bone Metastases in A Population-Based Healthcare System.']"""

However, there are limitations that must be overcome. Radiologists may be reluctant to change the conventional way of reporting. Error rates could potentially increase if SR is used improperly. Interruption of the visual search pattern by keeping the eyes focused on the report rather than the images may increase reporting time. Templates that include unnecessary or irrelevant information may undermine the consistency of the report. Last, the lack of support for multiple languages may hamper the adaptation of the report to the target audience. This work aims to mitigate these limitations with a web-based structured reporting system based on templates. By including field validators and logical rules, the system avoids reporting mistakes and allows to automatically calculate values and radiological qualitative scores. The system can manage quantitative information from imaging biomarkers, combining this with qualitative radiological information usually present in the structured report. It manages SR templates as plugins (IHE MRRT compliant and compatible with RSNA's Radreport templates), ensures a seamless integration with PACS/RIS systems, and adapts the report to the target audience by means of natural language extracts generated in multiple languages. We describe a use case of SR template for prostate cancer including PI-RADS 2.1 scoring system and imaging biomarkers. For the time being, the system comprises 24 SR templates and provides service in 37 hospitals and healthcare institutions, endorsing the success of this contribution to mitigate some of the limitations of the SR.""","""['A Mañas-García', 'I González-Valverde', 'E Camacho-Ramos', 'A Alberich-Bayarri', 'J A Maldonado', 'M Marcos', 'M Robles']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Digit Imaging""","""['Development of an IHE MRRT-compliant open-source web-based reporting platform.', 'Conversion of Radiology Reporting Templates to the MRRT Standard.', 'Structured prostate MRI reporting: how and why.', 'A Hybrid Reporting Platform for Extended RadLex Coding Combining Structured Reporting Templates and Natural Language Processing.', 'Structured Reporting in Cross-Sectional Imaging of the Heart: Reporting Templates for CMR Imaging of Cardiomyopathies (Myocarditis, Dilated Cardiomyopathy, Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy, Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy and Siderosis).']"""

To gain insight into the recent clinical findings that highlighted genomic alterations leading to hyperactivation of PI3K, we examined the roles of the commonly expressed p110 catalytic isoforms of PI3K in a murine model of Pten-null invasive CRPC. While blocking p110α had negligible effects in the development of Pten-null invasive CRPC, either genetic or pharmacologic perturbation of p110β dramatically slowed CRPC initiation and progression. Once fully established, CRPC tumors became partially resistant to p110β inhibition, indicating the acquisition of new dependencies. Driven by our genomic analyses highlighting potential roles for the p110β/RAC/PAK1 and β-catenin pathways in CRPC, we found that combining p110β with RAC/PAK1 or tankyrase inhibitors significantly reduced the growth of murine and human CRPC organoids in vitro and in vivo. Because p110β activity is dispensable for most physiologic processes, our studies support novel therapeutic strategies both for preventing disease progression into CRPC and for treating CRPC.  Implications:   This work establishes p110β as a promising target for preventing the progression of primary PTEN-deficient prostate tumors to CRPC, and for treating established CRPC in combination with RAC/PAK1 or tankyrase inhibitors.""","""['Xueliang Gao#', 'Yubao Wang#', 'Caroline F Ribeiro#', 'Cherubin Manokaran', 'Hyeyoun Chang', 'Thanh Von', 'Silvia Rodrigues', 'Onur Cizmecioglu', 'Shidong Jia', 'Manav Korpal', 'Joshua M Korn', 'Zhigang Wang', 'Fabienne Schmit', 'Lan Jiang', 'Raymond Pagliarini', 'Yi Yang', 'Isha Sethi', 'Sabina Signoretti', 'Guo-Cheng Yuan', 'Massimo Loda', 'Jean J Zhao', 'Thomas M Roberts']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Anti-androgen therapy induces transcriptomic reprogramming in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a murine model.', 'Characterization of a novel p110β-specific inhibitor BL140 that overcomes MDV3100-resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Identification of Pik3ca Mutation as a Genetic Driver of Prostate Cancer That Cooperates with Pten Loss to Accelerate Progression and Castration-Resistant Growth.', 'PI3K/p110β-specific inhibitors in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Interactions between androgen receptor signaling and other molecular pathways in prostate cancer progression: Current and future clinical implications.', 'Addressing the Reciprocal Crosstalk between the AR and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling Pathways for Prostate Cancer Treatment.', 'AR and PI3K/AKT in Prostate Cancer: A Tale of Two Interconnected Pathways.', 'Icariin: A Promising Natural Product in Biomedicine and Tissue Engineering.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'The Extracellular Matrix Stiffening: A Trigger of Prostate Cancer Progression and Castration Resistance?']"""

TRIM24 is claimed aberrantly activated in a number of cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer. However, the expression of TRIM24 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and its relationship with prognosis remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and underlying clinical significance of TRIM24 in EOC.  Results:   Data from Oncomine and immunohistochemistry of tissue samples demonstrated that TRIM24 expression was obviously elevated in ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovary tissues. Elevated TRIM24 expression was closely correlated with serum CA-125 (P = 0.0294), metastasis (P = 0.0022), FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) stage (P = 0.0068) and Ki-67 level (P = 0.0395). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis found that TRIM24 expression increased inversely with the clinical prognosis of patients with EOC. Moreover, colony formation and CCK-8 assays showed that TRIM24 promoted EOC cell growth, and tumorigenic experiments in nude mice showed that TRIM24 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo. The Spearman's correlations revealed that the expression of TRIM24 was significantly correlated with levels of Ki-67 (P = 0.01), at a correlation coefficient of 0.517. Wound-healing and transwell migration assays demonstrated TRIM24 facilitated cell migration. Mechanism studies showed that TRIM24 could promote the phosphorylation level of Akt and the process of EMT.  Conclusion:   Our results confirmed that TRIM24 could predict poor prognosis of EOC patients and promote tumor progression by regulating Akt pathway and EMT.

Disrupted healthcare access likely impacted early cancer detection. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of the pandemic on weekly reported cancer incidence.  Patients and methods:   This was a population-based study involving individuals diagnosed with cancer from September 25, 2016, to September 26, 2020, in Ontario, Canada. Weekly cancer incidence counts were examined using segmented negative binomial regression models. The weekly estimated backlog during the pandemic was calculated by subtracting the observed volume from the projected/expected volume in that week.  Results:   The cohort consisted of 358,487 adult patients with cancer. At the start of the pandemic, there was an immediate 34.3% decline in the estimated mean cancer incidence volume (relative rate, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.57-0.75), followed by a 1% increase in cancer incidence volume in each subsequent week (relative rate, 1.009; 95% CI, 1.001-1.017). Similar trends were found for both screening and nonscreening cancers. The largest immediate declines were seen for melanoma and cervical, endocrinologic, and prostate cancers. For hepatobiliary and lung cancers, there continued to be a weekly decline in incidence during the COVID-19 period.

However, it is unclear how they are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer. To elucidate the mechanistic link between MetS and prostate carcinogenesis, we characterized the development of MetS and prostate adenocarcinoma in prostate-specific Pten-/- (Ptenp-/-) mice fed a high-fat (HF) diet. We found that male Ptenp-/- mice on an HF diet gained excess body weight and elevated blood glucose, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels at 20 weeks of age and were obese at 40 weeks. Prostate adenocarcinoma multiplicity at 40 weeks was significantly higher in the mice on an HF diet, suggesting that the HF diet promotes the development of prostate adenocarcinoma. Increased cell proliferation and enhanced AKT activation were found in the prostates of mice on an HF diet. Further transcriptome study revealed that receptor tyrosine kinase regulation, which mediates insulin/IGF1 signaling, was one of the top enriched pathways by HF diet-induced transcriptome changes.

The algorithm can handle percentage dose-volume constraints (DVCs) that are usually found in such problems.  Methods:   To seek a feasible solution, the automatic relaxation method was used to project the spot weight vector onto the interval defined by lower and upper bound target dose constraints. The obtained solution was optimized separately based on the objective of each organ at risk (OAR) in addition to maximizing the minimum target dose using the bisection search method using a stopping criterion of 10 cGy. The combined weight was used in the CQ algorithm to solve the split feasibility problem but with a special projection technique due to the nonconvexity of DVCs. The algorithm was applied to four clinical IMPT cases (meningioma, prostate, tongue, and oropharynx) and compared to the corresponding treatment plans optimized in Eclipse.  Results:   The treatment plans obtained, for the four cases, using the BCQ-ARM algorithm have dosimetric endpoints that are similar to their counterparts generated from Eclipse. The algorithm worked equally well with all cases, including the complex head and neck ones. The stopping criterion of 10 cGy results in making the generated plans slightly less optimal ( ε $\epsilon$ -optimal) rather than optimal, but with the advantage of the possibility of generating a database of plans.  Conclusions:   The application of the BCQ-ARM algorithm to different cases of IMPT plans with DVCs was demonstrated. The algorithm is successful in generating plans that are dosimetrically equivalent to their corresponding Eclipse plans.

Methods:   After mean 7 years from therapy (range: 6-8), 431 PCa-survivors (RP: n = 313, RT: n = 118) completed a mailed questionnaire assessing persistent treatment-related adverse effects (AEs) (Expanded Prostate cancer Index Composite [EPIC-26]) and seven Quality indicators describing satisfaction with the health care service following a most often general practitioner (GP)-led follow-up plan. A logistic regression model evaluated the associations between long-term satisfaction and treatment modality, age, the seven satisfaction-related Quality indicators, and persistent AEs. The significance level was set at p< .05.  Results:   Four of five (81%) PCa-survivors reported long-term satisfaction with their treatment. In a multivariable model, satisfaction was positively associated with sufficient information about treatment and AEs, patient-perceived sufficient cooperation between the hospital and the GP and sufficient follow-up of AEs (ref.: insufficient). Age ≥70 years (ref.: <70) and a rising summary score within the EPIC-26 sexual domain additionally increased long-term satisfaction. The treatment modality itself (RP versus RT) did not significantly impact on satisfaction.  Conclusions:   The majority of curatively treated PCa-survivors are satisfied with their treatment more than 5 years after primary therapy.

However, its impact on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the prostate has yet to be assessed. Purpose To determine whether DLR can improve image quality of diffusion-weighted MRI at b values ranging from 1000 sec/mm2 to 5000 sec/mm2 in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, images of the prostate obtained at DWI with a b value of 0 sec/mm2, DWI with a b value of 1000 sec/mm2 (DWI1000), DWI with a b value of 3000 sec/mm2 (DWI3000), and DWI with a b value of 5000 sec/mm2 (DWI5000) from consecutive patients with biopsy-proven cancer from January to June 2020 were reconstructed with and without DLR. Image quality was assessed using signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) from region-of-interest analysis and qualitatively assessed using a five-point visual scoring system (1 [very poor] to 5 [excellent]) for each high-b-value DWI sequence with and without DLR. The SNR, CNR, and visual score for DWI with and without DLR were compared with the paired t test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction, respectively. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) from DWI with and without DLR were also compared with the paired t test with Bonferroni correction. Results A total of 60 patients (mean age, 67 years; age range, 49-79 years) were analyzed. DWI with DLR showed significantly higher SNRs and CNRs than DWI without DLR (P < .001); for example, with DWI1000 the mean SNR was 38.7 ± 0.6 versus 17.8 ± 0.6, respectively (P < .001), and the mean CNR was 18.4 ± 5.6 versus 7.4 ± 5.6, respectively (P < .001). DWI with DLR also demonstrated higher qualitative image quality than DWI without DLR (mean score: 4.8 ± 0.4 vs 4.0 ± 0.7, respectively, with DWI1000 [P = .001], 3.8 ± 0.7 vs 3.0 ± 0.8 with DWI3000 [P = .002], and 3.1 ± 0.8 vs 2.0 ± 0.9 with DWI5000 [P < .001]). ADCs derived with and without DLR did not differ substantially (P > .99). Conclusion Deep learning reconstruction improves the image quality of diffusion-weighted MRI scans of prostate cancer with no impact on apparent diffusion coefficient quantitation with a 3.0-T MRI system. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

However, there are some difficulties in the combination of BPEs and multiplex electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensing, such as the need for small sample consumption, multistep operations, and separated sample loading. In this paper, a microfluidic BPE array chip was fabricated toward multiplex detection of cancer biomarkers. With a special channel structure and the difference in flow resistance of channels of different sizes, the direction of liquid flow was successfully controlled. In this way, rapid and automatic multiplex sampling was achieved on the array, which would help improve the sensing efficiency and reduce the reagent consumption. The ECL BPE array chip served as an immunosensor for multiple prostate cancer biomarkers including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The microfluidic BPE chip shows good reproducibility and high sensitivity. The limits of detection for PSA, IL-6, and PSMA are 0.093 ng/mL, 0.061 pg/mL, and 0.059 ng/mL, respectively. It also exhibits excellent performance in real sample analysis.

Both active surveillance or watchful waiting (AS/WW) and focal laser ablation (FLA) can avoid the complications caused by radical treatment. How to make the choice between these options in clinical practice needs further study. Therefore, this study aims to compare and analyze their effects based on overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) to obtain better long-term benefits. We included patients with low-risk PCa from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database of 2010-2016. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted for OS and CSS in the two groups. To eliminate bias, this study applied a series of sensitivity analyses. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to obtain survival status. A total of 18 841 patients with low-risk PCa were included, with a median of 36-month follow-up. According to the multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression, the FLA group presented inferior survival benefits in OS than the AS/WW group (hazard ratio [HR]: 2.13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.37-3.33, P < 0.05). After adjusting for confounders, the result persisted (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.02-2.81, P < 0.05). According to the results of the sensitivity analysis, the inverse probability of the treatment weighing model indicated the same result in OS. In conclusion, AS/WW and FLA have the advantage of fewer side effects and the benefit of avoiding overtreatment compared with standard treatment.

The median follow-up was 24 months, and at the end of follow-up, the proportion of patients who progressed to castration-resistant prostate cancer in the CTC+CD133+ group was 93.3%, which was significantly higher than that of the circulating tumor cell negative group (73.3%) and the CTC+CD133- group (75.0%), with P = 0.043. After follow-up, progression-free survival for CTC+CD133+, CTC+CD133-, and circulating tumor cell patients was 10.0, 13.0, and 14.0 months, respectively, with P = 0.022. Univariate and multivariate analyses also confirmed that the characterization of circulating tumor cells using CD133 can independently predict progression-free survival in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients after receiving androgen deprivation therapy (P = 0.042; hazard ratio 1.396).  Conclusion:   Baseline CTC+CD133+ was a poor independent prognostic factor for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer patients to progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer after receiving androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['Yunjie Yang', 'Zheng Liu', 'Qifeng Wang', 'Kun Chang', 'Junyu Zhang', 'Dingwei Ye', 'Yunyi Kong', 'Bo Dai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Phenotypes of circulating tumour cells predict time to castration resistance in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Combination of circulating tumor cell enumeration and tumor marker detection in predicting prognosis and treatment effect in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic association of plasma cell-free DNA-based androgen receptor amplification and circulating tumor cells in pre-chemotherapy metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Prominin-1 deletion results in spermatogenic impairment, sperm morphological defects, and infertility in mice.', 'Triple-negative mouse breast cancer initiating cells show high expression of beta1 integrin and increased malignant features.', 'Biomarkers for the Detection and Risk Stratification of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: The Role of CD133.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF), Pain Interference (PI), and Depression domains in comparison to the Spine Oncology Study Group-Outcomes Questionnaire (SOSG-OQ) in patients with metastatic spine disease.  Summary of background data:   While there remains a significant movement toward incorporating patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) into clinical care, there are few validated PROMs for patients with metastatic spine disease. The SOSG-OQ was designed and validated for metastatic spine tumor patients. However, the use of general symptom-based PROMs, such as PROMIS domains, may reduce both patient and physician burden and improve interdisciplinary care if shown to be concurrently valid.  Methods:   Metastatic spine tumor patients from January 2017 to July 2021 at a single academic medical center were asked to complete PROMIS PF, PI, and Depression domains and the SOSG-OQ. Spearman correlation (p) coefficients were calculated.  Results:   A total of 103 unique visits, representing 79 patients met our inclusion criteria. A majority were men (59; 57%) and Caucasian (93; 90%), and the average age was 64-years-old (range: 34-87). There were 13 different types of histologies reported, with multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer representing 28 (27%), 26 (25%), and 13 (13%), respectively. Additional cancers included renal cell carcinoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, thyroid cancer, large B-cell lymphoma, nonHodgkin lymphoma, esophageal cancer, plasmacytoma, metastatic paraganglioma, and metastatic spindle cell sarcoma. SOSG-OQ was strongly correlated with PROMIS PI (ρ = 0.78) and PROMIS PF (ρ = 0.71), and moderately correlated with PROMIS Depression (ρ = 0.58).  Conclusion:   PROMIS PF, PI, and Depression appear to capture similar clinical insight as the SOSG-OQ.

However, IL-15 has a very short half-life and a single administration does not provide the sustained exposure required for optimal stimulation of target immune cells. The purpose of this work was to develop a very long-acting prodrug that would maintain IL-15 within a narrow therapeutic window for long periods-similar to a continuous infusion.  Methods:   We prepared and characterized hydrogel microspheres (MS) covalently attached to IL-15 (MS~IL-15) by a releasable linker. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of MS~IL-15 were determined in C57BL/6J mice. The antitumor activity of MS~IL-15 as a single agent, and in combination with a suitable therapeutic antibody, was tested in a CD8+ T cell-driven bilateral transgenic adenocarcinoma mouse prostate (TRAMP)-C2 model of prostatic cancer and a NK cell-driven mouse xenograft model of human ATL (MET-1) murine model of adult T-cell leukemia.  Results:   On subcutaneous administration to mice, the cytokine released from the depot maintained a long half-life of about 168 hours over the first 5 days, followed by an abrupt decrease to about ~30 hours in accordance with the development of a cytokine sink. A single injection of MS~IL-15 caused remarkably prolonged expansions of NK and ɣδ T cells for 2 weeks, and CD44hiCD8+ T cells for 4 weeks. In the NK cell-driven MET-1 murine model of adult T-cell leukemia, single-agent MS~IL-1550 μg or anti-CCR4 provided modest increases in survival, but a combination-through antibody-depedent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)-significantly extended survival. In a CD8+ T cell-driven bilateral TRAMP-C2 model of prostatic cancer, single agent subcutaneous MS~IL-15 or unilateral intratumoral agonistic anti-CD40 showed modest growth inhibition, but the combination exhibited potent, prolonged bilateral antitumor activity.  Conclusions:   Our results show MS~IL-15 provides a very long-acting IL-15 with low Cmax that elicits prolonged expansion of target immune cells and high anticancer activity, especially when administered in combination with a suitable immuno-oncology agent.""","""['John A Hangasky', 'Wei Chen#', 'Sigrid P Dubois#', 'Anusara Daenthanasanmak#', 'Jürgen R Müller', 'Ralph Reid', 'Thomas A Waldmann#', 'Daniel V Santi#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Augmented IL-15Rα expression by CD40 activation is critical in synergistic CD8 T cell-mediated antitumor activity of anti-CD40 antibody with IL-15 in TRAMP-C2 tumors in mice.', 'IL-15 in the Combination Immunotherapy of Cancer.', 'Simultaneous inhibition of two regulatory T-cell subsets enhanced Interleukin-15 efficacy in a prostate tumor model.', 'TransCon IL-2 β/γ: a novel long-acting prodrug with sustained release of an IL-2Rβ/γ-selective IL-2 variant with improved pharmacokinetics and potent activation of cytotoxic immune cells for the treatment of cancer.', 'Interleukin 15 Pharmacokinetics and Consumption by a Dynamic Cytokine Sink.', 'Research progress of interleukin-15 in cancer immunotherapy.', 'The role of interleukin-15 in the development and treatment of hematological malignancies.', 'Advances in engineering and delivery strategies for cytokine immunotherapy.', 'Application of injectable hydrogels in cancer immunotherapy.', 'INBRX-120, a CD8α-targeted detuned IL-2 that selectively expands and activates tumoricidal effector cells for safe and durable in vivo responses.']"""

An analysis based on dosimetric parameters might be more relevant in clinical practice but is often lacking in the literature. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of state-of-the-art 3D U-Net-generated organ delineations on dose optimization in radiation therapy (RT) for prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   A database of 69 computed tomography images with prostate, bladder, and rectum delineations was used for single-label 3D U-Net training with dice similarity coefficient (DSC)-based loss. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans have been generated for both manual and automatic segmentations with the same optimization settings. These were chosen to give consistent plans when applying perturbations to the manual segmentations. Contours were evaluated in terms of DSC, average and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD). Dose distributions were evaluated with the manual segmentation as reference using dose volume histogram (DVH) parameters and a 3%/3 mm gamma-criterion with 10% dose cut-off. A Pearson correlation coefficient between DSC and dosimetric metrics, i.e. gamma index and DVH parameters, has been calculated.  Results:   3D U-Net-based segmentation achieved a DSC of 0.87 (0.03) for prostate, 0.97 (0.01) for bladder and 0.89 (0.04) for rectum. The mean and 95% HD were below 1.6 (0.4) and below 5 (4) mm, respectively. The DVH parameters, V[Formula: see text] for the bladder and V[Formula: see text] for the rectum, showed agreement between dose distributions within [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], respectively. The D[Formula: see text] and V[Formula: see text], for prostate and its 3 mm expansion (surrogate clinical target volume) showed agreement with the reference dose distribution within 2% and 3 Gy with the exception of one case. The average gamma pass-rate was 85%. The comparison between geometric and dosimetric metrics showed no strong statistically significant correlation.  Conclusions:   The 3D U-Net developed for this work achieved state-of-the-art geometrical performance. Analysis based on clinically relevant DVH parameters of VMAT plans demonstrated neither excessive dose increase to OARs nor substantial under/over-dosage of the target in all but one case. Yet the gamma analysis indicated several cases with low pass rates.

Methods:   Retrospective cohort study investigating 184 patients (107 IMN, and 77 Arthro/ORIF) surgically treated for metastatic long bone fractures. Patients were required to have a single surgically treated impending or established pathologic fracture of a long bone, pre-operative lung imaging (lung radiograph or computed tomography) and post-operative lung imaging within 6 months of surgery. Primary cancer types included were breast (n = 70), lung (n = 43), prostate (n = 34), renal cell (n = 37). Statistical analyses were conducted using two-tailed Fisher's exact tests, and Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.  Results:   Patients treated with IMN and Arthro/ORIF developed new or progressive lung metastases following surgery at an incidence of 34 and 26%, respectively. Surgical method did not significantly influence lung metastasis (p = 0.33). Furthermore, an analysis of primary cancer subgroups did not yield any differences between IMN vs Arthro/ORIF. Median survival for the entire cohort was 11 months and 1-year overall survival was 42.7% (95% CI: 35.4-49.8). Regardless of fixation method, the presence of new or progressive lung metastatic disease at follow up imaging study was found to have a negative impact on patient survival (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   In this study, development or progression of metastatic lung disease was not affected by long bone stabilization strategy. IM manipulation of metastatic long bone fractures therefore may not result in a clinically relevant increase in metastatic lung burden.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are deeply involved in OC progression. The aim of this study is to explore the specific mechanism of lncRNA prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in OC.  Methods:   Quantitative real time PCR was utilized to determine the expression levels of PART1, microRNA (miR)-503-5p and forkhead-box k1 (FOXK1) in OC tissues and/or cells. The cell viability, migration, and invasion in OC were evaluated by 3-(4, 5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2-h-tetrazolium bromide assay, wound healing assay and transwell invasion assay, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell apoptosis. The xenograft tumor was conducted in nude mice to verify the effect of PART1 knockdown on OC in vivo. The target relationships among PART1, miR-503-5p and FOXK1 were predicted by StarBase, and verified by luciferase reporter assay. The level of FOXK1 was assessed by western blot.  Results:   Increased expression of PART1 and FOXK1 was observed in OC tissues or cells, whereas miR-503-5p was downregulated. PART1 silencing or miR-503-5p overexpression repressed the cell viability, migration and invasion, and protomed apoptosis. Meanwhile, miR-503-5p was a target of PART1, and FOXK1 was a direct target gene of miR-503-5p. Both downregulation of miR-503-5p and upregulation of FOXK1 partly relieved the suppressive effects of PART1 knockdown on the oncogenicity of OC in vitro.  Conclusion:   Decreased PART1 represses the cell viability, migration and invasion of OC via regulating the miR-503-5p/FOXK1 axis, which provided an underlying target for treating OC.""","""['Bing Li', 'Ge Lou', 'Jiahui Zhang', 'Ning Cao', 'Xi Yu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A review on the role of long non-coding RNA prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in the etiology of different disorders.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PART1: dual role in cancer.', 'Knockdown of circAPLP2 Inhibits Progression of Colorectal Cancer by Regulating miR-485-5p/FOXK1 Axis.', 'Long non-coding RNA MCM3AP-AS1 promotes growth and migration through modulating FOXK1 by sponging miR-138-5p in pancreatic cancer.', 'LncRNA PART1 facilitates the malignant progression of colorectal cancer via miR-150-5p/LRG1 axis.', 'A review on the role of long non-coding RNA prostate androgen-regulated transcript 1 (PART1) in the etiology of different disorders.', 'Long non‑coding RNA PART1: dual role in cancer.', 'Identification of LOC101927355 as a Novel Biomarker for Preeclampsia.', 'Long non-coding RNA HOXA11-AS knockout inhibits proliferation and overcomes drug resistance in ovarian cancer.']"""

Its use allows stability of some compounds, targeted delivery, and increased half-life, in this context, making some treatment proposals more effective. Prostate cancer, in turn, is among the types of cancer with the highest mortality, and the lack of effective treatment causes several strategies to meet this need.  Objective:   The objective of this work was to verify patents that use polymeric nanoparticles for the treatment of prostate cancer.  Methods:   For that, specific keywords to direct the search were applied in Patent Scope. After obtaining the patents, one was selected for the development of critical analysis in relation to its chemistry and biology.  Results:   A total of five patents were found and, of these, an invention that used PCL-PLGA-PEGCOOH polymeric nanoparticles with two natural compounds, resveratrol and celastrol, providing an alternative method to traditional monotherapies.  Conclusion:   The prospective analysis serves to direct us in relation to the technologies currently used in certain fields.

The prior mean dose approach is referred to as conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), and unfortunately produces noticeably worse DVH metric results than gradient-based approaches. We have improved upon the CVaR approach, using the so-called Truncated CVaR (TCVaR), by excluding the hottest or coldest voxels in the structure from the calculations of the mean dose of the tail. Our approach applies an iterative sequence of convex approximations to improve the selection of the excluded voxels. Data Envelopment Analysis was used to quantify the sensitivity of TCVaR results to parameter choice and to compare the quality of a library of 256 TCVaR plans created for each of prostate, breast, and cervix treatment sites with commercially-generated plans.Results:In terms of traditional DVH metrics, TCVaR outperformed CVaR and the improvements increased monotonically as more iterations were used to identify and exclude the hottest/coldest voxels from the optimization problem. TCVaR also outperformed the Eclipse-Brachyvision TPS, with an improvement in PTVD95% (for equivalent organ-at-risk doses) of up to 5% (prostate), 3% (breast), and 1% (cervix).Conclusions:A novel optimization algorithm for HDR treatment planning produced plans with superior DVH metrics compared with a prior convex optimization algorithm as well as Eclipse-Brachyvision.

In the present study, the association between ESCO1 expression and the prognosis of prostate cancer was investigated, and the potential molecular mechanisms underlying its actions in tumor progression were also examined.  Methods:   Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to detect the expression of ESCO1 in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), human prostate cancer, and metastasis tissue samples, and the association between the establishment of ESCO1 expression and the prognosis of prostate cancer was investigated. The effect of ESCO1 expression on the viability, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells in vitro was analyzed, along with the effect of ESCO1 silencing on the growth of prostate tumors in vivo.  Results:   The results demonstrated an increase in the expression of ESCO1 in prostate cancer tissue when compared with BPH, and it was significantly associated with tumor malignancy and poor patient survival. Additionally, knockdown of ESCO1 significantly inhibited the viability and migration of prostate cancer cell.

However, the safety of AS for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer remains unclear.  Patients and methods:   We identified men with NCCN-classified low-risk and favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between 2001 and 2015 and initially managed with AS in the Veterans Health Administration. We analyzed progression to definitive treatment, metastasis, prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), and all-cause mortality using cumulative incidences and multivariable competing-risks regression.  Results:   The cohort included 9,733 men, of whom 1,007 (10.3%) had intermediate-risk disease (773 [76.8%] favorable, 234 [23.2%] unfavorable), followed for a median of 7.6 years. The 10-year cumulative incidence of metastasis was significantly higher for patients with favorable (9.6%; 95% CI, 7.1%-12.5%; P<.001) and unfavorable intermediate-risk disease (19.2%; 95% CI, 13.4%-25.9%; P<.001) than for those with low-risk disease (1.5%; 95% CI, 1.2%-1.9%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of PCSM was also significantly higher for patients with favorable (3.7%; 95% CI, 2.3%-5.7%; P<.001) and unfavorable intermediate-risk disease (11.8%; 95% CI, 6.8%-18.4%; P<.001) than for those with low-risk disease (1.1%; 95% CI, 0.8%-1.4%). In multivariable competing-risks regression, favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk patients had significantly increased risks of metastasis and PCSM compared with low-risk patients (all P<.001).  Conclusions:   Compared with low-risk patients, those with favorable and unfavorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer managed with AS are at increased risk of metastasis and PCSM.

A previously unveiled selective P2Y1 receptor agonist, the indoline-derived HIC (1-(1-((2-hydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)(4-hydroxyphenyl)methyl)indoline-4-carbonitrile), induces a series of molecular and biological responses in PCa cells PC3 and DU145, but minimal toxicity to normal cells.

Here, the presence of HIC and AA significantly inhibited cell proliferation of PC3 and DU145 cells with time-dependent manner as a synerfistic combination. Moreover, it was also shown that the anticancer and antimetastasis effects of the combinratorial drugs were noticed through a decrease in colony-forming ability, cell migration, and cell invasion. In addition, the HIC + AA induced apoptotic population of PCa cells as well as cell cycle arrest in G1 progression phase.

Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP-α) overexpression has been shown to occur in a wide range of tumors. However, the specific mechanism of FAP-α in the development of prostate cancer has not been reported.  Methods:   In this study, real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of FAP-α mRNA in prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3, LNCaP, and DU145) and human normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting FAP-α and vectors expressing exogenous FAP-α were transfected to prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and DU145) to investigate the function of FAP-α. BALB/c nude mice were injected with DU145 cells which were transfected with NC-siRNA, FAP-α-siRNA-1, or FAP-α-siRNA-2.  Results:   Compared to adjacent normal tissues, FAP-α protein and mRNA levels in prostate cancer tissues increased significantly (P<0.05). Compared to patients with high FAP-α mRNA levels, patients with low FAP-α mRNA levels had a significantly higher survival rate (χ²=5.050, log-rank P=0.025). Overexpression of FAP-α in LNCaP cells markedly inhibited cell apoptosis, and promoted cell invasion and proliferation. In contrast, knockdown of FAP-α expression in DU145 cells can significantly reduce invasion, proliferation, and promote apoptosis in prostate cancer. Immunofluorescence assay further indicated that down-regulation of FAP-α could suppress the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. An in vivo study found that compared with the NC-siRNA group, the tumor weight and tumor volume in the FAP-α-siRNA-1 and FAP-α-siRNA-2 groups were significantly decreased.

By recruiting cereblon, we were able to demonstrate the potent degradation of AR in lung cancer cells. Furthermore, the initial evaluation enabled the design of an optimized PROTAC with a rigid linker that degraded AR with a DC50 value in the nanomolar range. These results provide novel AR-directed PROTACs and a clear rationale for further investigating AR involvement in lung cancer models.""","""['Lukas M Gockel', 'Vladlena Pfeifer', 'Fabian Baltes', 'Rafael D Bachmaier', 'Karl G Wagner', 'Gerd Bendas', 'Michael Gütschow', 'Izidor Sosič', 'Christian Steinebach']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Arch Pharm (Weinheim)""","""['Designed, synthesized and biological evaluation of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) as AR degraders for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Targeting androgen receptor degradation with PROTACs from bench to bedside.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of niclosamide PROTACs.', 'Design and characterization of cereblon-mediated androgen receptor proteolysis-targeting chimeras.', 'Targeting androgen receptor for prostate cancer therapy: From small molecules to PROTACs.', 'Chemical Tagging of Bioactive Amides by Cooperative Catalysis: Applications in the Syntheses of Drug Conjugates.', 'PROTACs in the Management of Prostate Cancer.', 'Solubility Enhanced Formulation Approaches to Overcome Oral Delivery Obstacles of PROTACs.', 'Encoding BRAF inhibitor functions in protein degraders.', 'Concurrent Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer Improves Survival for Synchronous or Metachronous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A SEER-Medicare Database Analysis.']"""

However, the roles of PNPO in other types of cancer remain unknown. Methods: The expression of PNPO was interpreted by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Genotype Tissue-Expression (GTEX) database. Analysis of PNPO genomic alterations and protein expression in human organic tissues was analyzed by the cBioPortal database and human multiple organ tissue arrays. PNPO with drug sensitivity analysis was performed from the CellMiner database. The correlations between PNPO expression and survival outcomes, clinical features, DNA mismatch repair system (MMR), microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutation burden (TMB), and immune-associated cell infiltration were analyzed using the TCGA, ESTIMATE algorithm, and TIMER databases. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was applied to elucidate the biological function of PNPO in pan-cancer. Results: The differential analysis showed that the level of PNPO mRNA expression was upregulated in 21 tumor types compared with normal tissues, which was consistent with its protein expression in most cancer types. The abnormal expression of PNPO could predict the survival outcome of patients with esophageal carcinoma (ESCA), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV), and uveal melanoma (UVM). Furthermore, the most frequent mutation type of PNPO genomic was amplified. Moreover, the aberrant PNPO expression was related to MMR, MSI, TMB, and drug sensitivity in various types of cancer. The expression of PNPO was related to the infiltration levels of various immune-associated cells in pan-cancer by ESTIMATE algorithm and TIMER database mining.

Recently membrane-bound progesterone receptors (mPRs) were discovered to mediate the non-genomic effect of progesterone. Aberrant expressions of these mPRs were reported in human breast, ovarian, urinary bladder, brain, uterine, and prostate cancers. However, their expression profiles in RCC are yet to be assessed.  Methods:   Multiple datasets from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), cDNA microarray, and proteomic analysis were used to compare gene expression between cancerous and normal kidney tissues. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to examine protein expression in kidney tissues. Promoter methylation levels were assessed for correlation analysis with gene expression.  Results:   Of the seven membrane-bound progesterone receptor genes, the progestin and adipoQ receptor-5 (PAQR5) gene is predominantly expressed in normal kidney tissue but was significantly downregulated in RCC tissues. PAQR5 downregulation correlated with tumor stage, cancer grade, lymph node invasion, and distal metastasis only in clear cell RCC (ccRCC) tissues. PAQR5 downregulation was associated with an increased promoter DNA methylation and a poor survival outcome in ccRCC patients. In addition, PAQR5 expression inversely correlated with transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) expression, and TGFβ1 treatment significantly reduced PAQR5 gene expression.

We show that MUC1-C→ARID1A/BAF signaling induces IFNGR1 transcription and that MUC1-C-induced activation of the NuRD complex suppresses FBXW7 in stabilizing the IFNGR1 protein.

Most SWI/SNF deficient tumors share common rhabdoid morphology. ARID1A is the most frequently dysregulated SWI/SNF subunit in human cancer and inactivation of ARID1A is frequent across carcinomatous types while very rarely drives the tumorigenesis of sarcomas. Herein, we report a rare case of primary prostatic undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma with focal rhabdoid morphology, harboring biallelic inactivation of ARID1A detected by next-generation sequencing with complete loss of ARID1A expression by immunohistochemistry.  Case presentation:   The patient is a 58-year-old man who presented with dysuria and obstructive voiding symptoms for 3 month and was found to have a large, ill-defined, prostatic mass lesion with circumferential extension into the rectal wall on imaging studies. A needle biopsy showed a spindle cell undifferentiated sarcoma of the prostate and the patient was treated by chemotherapy of combined etoposide and cisplatin for 2 months. A subsequent imaging study showed that the tumor was significantly enlarged, and the patient underwent laparoscopically radical prostatectomy. Gross examination showed a disrupted, 10 × 7 × 5 cm, solid and cystic mass involving almost the entire prostate and sparing the seminal vesicle glands. Histologic examination showed that tumor was composed mainly of mildly atypical, oval to spindle-shaped cells, arranged in sheets and fascicles or herringbone-like patterns within a small amount of edematous to myxoid, vascularized stroma. Notably, groups of discohesive rhabdoid tumor cells with eccentric nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and abundant globular cytoplasm were observed. There were prominent mitotic figures, multifocal geographic necroses, and foci of lymphovascular invasion. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were diffusely positive for TLE-1 and vimentin and focally positive for epithelial membrane antigen, AE1/3, Cam5.2, SATB2, and CD34 (all in less than 10% tumor cells). Next-generation sequencing showed biallelic inactivation mutation of ARID1A; the predicted inactivating effect of ARID1A deletion was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. After the surgery, the patient received an alternative combined chemotherapy of doxorubicin and ifosfamide for 5 months. The patient died 9 months after initial presentation due to extensive abdominal metastases.  Conclusions:   We report an ARID1A deficient undifferentiated spindle cell and rhabdoid sarcoma of the prostate, adding to the growing spectrum of SWI/SNF driven undifferentiated sarcoma. Rhabdoid cells can be a helpful morphological clue for promoting molecular and immunohistochemical analyses for deficiency of SWI/SNF subunits, in the diagnostic workup of undifferentiated neoplasms featuring epithelioid or rhabdoid morphology.""","""['Wenjuan Xu', 'Haiying Dong', 'Guoqing Ru', 'Ming Zhao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Diagn Pathol""","""['Claudin-4 expression distinguishes SWI/SNF complex-deficient undifferentiated carcinomas from sarcomas.', 'SWI/SNF Complex-deficient Undifferentiated/Rhabdoid Carcinomas of the Gastrointestinal Tract: A Series of 13 Cases Highlighting Mutually Exclusive Loss of SMARCA4 and SMARCA2 and Frequent Co-inactivation of SMARCB1 and SMARCA2.', 'SWI/SNF complex-deficient soft tissue neoplasms: An update.', 'SWI/SNF-deficient thoraco-pulmonary neoplasms.', 'Gastric SWI/SNF complex deletion-associated undifferentiated carcinoma with rhabdoid phenotype: a clinicopathological and molecular analysis.']"""

Background:   Anthocephalus cadamba is a traditionally used Indian medicinal plant. The anticancer and phytochemical properties of this plant remain unexplored except for a few studies.  Objectives:   The objective of the study was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of extract and fractions against breast cancer and prostate cancer cell lines and isolate and characterize active compounds from bio-active guided fractions. Moreover, the anticancer activity of isolated compounds against breast and prostate cancer cell lines was also evaluated, in addition to in silico and molecular docking interactions of isolated compounds with VEGFR2 and PDGFRα target proteins.  Methods:   The compounds were isolated and purified with the help of repeated column chromatography, and spectral techniques, such as 1D, 2D NMR, and GC-MS/MS, were used to identify and elucidate the structure of the compounds. Moreover, prediction of activity spectra for substances, physiochemical properties, bioactivity radar prediction, bioactivity score, natural-product likeness, ADME, and toxicity parameters of isolated compounds (AC-1 to AC-4) was performed through various in-silico databases and servers. To evaluate the docking interaction profile and binding energies of compounds, three docking tools were utilized, such as AutoDock, AutoDock Vina, and iGEMDOCK, against two targets VEGFR2 and PDGFRα. MD simulation was performed through ligand and receptor molecular dynamic server (LARMD).  Results:   It was found that the A. cadamba bark chloroform fraction demonstrated a significant inhibitory effect against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC-3 cells in a dose-time-dependent manner. The bioassay-guided isolation afforded four molecules AC-1 to AC-4 from chloroform fraction. Moreover, the GC-MS/MS profiling identified fourteen new molecules which were not reported earlier from A. cadamba. The in-silico study showed that the isolated compounds (AC-1 to AC-4) followed Lipinski's rule and had good oral bioavailability. While compound AC-4 had positive bioactivity scores except for kinase inhibitor activity. The ADMET profiling revealed that AC-4 was non-toxic and easily absorbed in the human intestine, and transportable in the blood-brain barrier compared to AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, and standard drug doxorubicin. Molecular docking and MD simulation assessment also signified AC-4 anticancer activity with dual inhibitory action against the target proteins VEGFR2 and PDGFRα amongst the studied compounds. The in vitro cell viability assay of isolated compounds demonstrated that AC-1 showed IC50 (μg/mL) value of 34.96 ±3.91, 47.76±3.80 69.1±4.96, AC-2; 68.26±4.22, 54.03±5.14, >100, AC-3; 35.34±4.14, 51.5±51.5, 70.8±5.25 and AC-4; 44.2±3.57, 24.2±2.67, 51.2±2.54 for MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC-3 cancer cell lines, respectively and compared with standard drug doxorubicin. Moreover, fluorescence microscopy confirmed the apoptogenic property of compounds. We also found that AC-4 exhibited significant intracellular ROS production in breast cancer cells, thereby inducing apoptosis and eventually cell death.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, A. cadamba afforded four pure molecules AC-1 to AC-4 with the identification of fourteen new compounds. The entire in-silico studies concluded that the AC-4 compound had better oral bioavailability, bioactivity score, and ADMET profile among studied molecules. Molecular docking analysis and MD simulation also supported AC-4 dual inhibitory action against both VEGFR2 and PDGFRα receptors. Moreover, the isolated molecules AC-1, AC-2, AC-3, and AC-4 were found to be active against MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC-3 cancer cells. The molecule AC-4 was found to induce ROS-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer cells. It was found that the anticancer inhibitory potentiality of AC-4 is directed to its molecular stereochemistry which specifically binds to the target proteins of breast cancer cells with no toxicological effect. Therefore, AC-4 is suggested to be an effective aspirant for novel drug design and discovery.""","""['Jamal Akhtar Ansari', 'Mohammad Kaleem Ahmad', 'Nishat Fatima', 'Iqbal Azad', 'Abbas Ali Mahdi', 'G N V Satyanarayan', 'Naseem Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Antioxidant, Antigenotoxic and Cytotoxic Activity of Anthocephalus cadamba (Roxb.)

Materials and methods:   LAP-01 is the first multicenter randomized patient blinded trial comparing outcomes after robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RP. This study stratified the entire population that received nerve-sparing surgery and was potent at baseline by the following ages: ≤ 60 years, 61-65 years, and > 65 years. Potency was assessed using the IIEF-5. The EORTC QLQ-C30 was used for global health perception and the EORTC QLQ-PR25 for urinary symptoms. Continence was assessed by the number of pads used. Longitudinal change was assessed using either validated anchor-based criteria or the 1 or 0.5-standard-deviation criterion. Worsening of continence was measured by increasing numbers of pads.  Results:   310 patients were included into this study. Older patients had a significantly higher risk for worsening of continence at 3 and 6 months (OR 2.21, 95% CI [1.22, 4.02], p = 0.009 and OR 2.00, 95% CI [1.16, 3.46], p = 0.013, respectively); at 12 months, the odds of worsening did not differ significantly between age groups. Potency scores were better in younger patients from a cross-sectional perspective, but longitudinal change did not differ between the age groups. In contrast, global health perception was better in older patients from a cross-sectional perspective and longitudinal decreases were significantly more common among the youngest patients, at 12 months (36.9% vs. 24.4%, p = 0.038).

The role of brachytherapy ± ADT in the absence of EBRT is not well defined. We hypothesized that EBRT+BT±ADT is associated with improved overall survival (OS) relative to BT±ADT for UIR-PCa.  Methods and materials:   Men with UIR-PCa diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 were identified in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Inverse propensity of treatment weighting was used to balance covariables that influenced treatment allocation and outcomes, and propensity-weighted multivariable analysis (MVA) using Cox regression modeling was used to compare OS hazard ratios.  Results:   A total of 11,721 men were stratified into four treatment groups: (1) BT without ADT (n = 4,535), (2) BT+ADT (n = 1,303), (3) EBRT+BT (n = 3,446), or (4) EBRT+BT+ADT (n = 2,437). Relative to patients treated with BT alone, BT+ADT (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.86 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.76-0.99], p = 0.03), EBRT+BT (HR: 0.79 [0.70-0.88], p = 0.00002), and EBRT+BT+ADT (HR: 0.76 [0.67-0.85], p = 0.000003) were associated with improved OS on MVA. Relative to BT alone, EBRT+BT correlated with improved OS on weight-adjusted MVA (HR: 0.82 [0.75-0.89], p = 0.000005). 10-year OS for BT vs. EBRT+BT was 62.4% [60.1-64.7] vs. 69.3% [67.5-71.2], respectively (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   EBRT+BT correlated with improved OS relative to BT alone in men with UIR-PCa, reaffirming current NCCN recommendations recommending EBRT+BT over BT alone.

Volume changes and initial clinical results focusing on patients treated with prostatic artery embolization (PAE) were evaluated in this study.  Methods and materials:   A group of 102 consecutive patients were treated with permanent interstitial brachytherapy (PIB), 13 patients received a neoadjuvant PAE (median 12 weeks before PIB) in case of large prostate volume >60 cm³, and moderate to severe urinary problems.  Results:   Patients after PAE were treated with significantly larger prostate volumes (52 ± 11 cm³ vs. 39 ± 11 cm³; p < 0.01; 66 ± 17 cm³ before PAE), but larger volume reductions to 44 ± 10 cm³ versus 35 ± 10 cm³ was found at day 30 (p < 0.05). International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) decreased significantly from 13 ± 5 before PAE to 7 ± 4 after PAE; p < 0.01. Initial PSA and first PSA after PIB were similar for patients with versus without PAE (5.9 ± 2.9 ng/mL vs. 6.2 ± 2.8 ng/mL and 1.5 ± 0.8 ng/mL vs. 1.9 ± 1.5 ng/mL). However, PSA 12 months after PIB was significantly lower after PAE (0.4 ± 0.3 ng/mL vs. 0.8 ± 0.6 ng/mL; p = 0.03). Four patients without prior PAE needed an intervention after urinary retention - transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in three cases and PAE in a single case. Urinary incontinence resulted in two cases after TURP.  Conclusions:   PAE could be successfully applied to decrease prostate volume and reduce urinary symptoms before PIB or as a treatment for urinary retention after PIB. A significantly lower PSA is promising for improved long-term cancer control.""","""['Hathal Haddad', 'Horst Hermani', 'Peter Bischoff', 'Herbert Hanitzsch', 'Albert Heidrich', 'Andreas Schaefer', 'Attila Kovács', 'Michael Pinkawa']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Efficacy and safety of prostate artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia: an observational study and propensity-matched comparison with transurethral resection of the prostate (the UK-ROPE study).', 'Retrospective observation of the efficacy and safety of prostatic artery embolization combined with transurethral resection of the prostate and simple transurethral resection of the prostate in the treatment of large (>\u2009100\xa0mL) benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Comparing Prostatic Artery Embolization to Gold-Standard Transurethral Resection of the Prostate for Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Efficacy and safety of prostatic artery embolization for benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Prostatic artery embolization in treating benign prostatic hyperplasia: a systematic review.', 'Prostatic artery occlusion: a new strategy to improve clinical outcomes of prostatic artery embolization?', 'Dose Distribution of High Dose-Rate and Low Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy at Different Intervals-Impact of a Hydrogel Spacer and Prostate Volume.']"""

Initial mean PSA was 10.5 ng/ml (±13.9) while 244 (44.8%), 202 (37.1%) and 99 (18.2%) had low, intermediate or high-risk disease. Treatments were implant only in 287 (52.7%), and implant with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) ± external beam in 258. Radiation doses were converted to the biologically equivalent dose (BED). Final biopsy results were the last biopsy performed on that patient. Associations for the first and final biopsies with PSA, clinical stage (CS), Gleason grade group, time on hormone therapy (ADT) and BED were determined by ANOVA, chi-square and binary linear regression.

Thus, we investigated cytogenetic and molecular alterations linked to AR.  Materials and methods:   To evaluate AR methylation, we performed a cytogenetic-molecular analysis using fluorescence in situ hybridization that uses specific probes for the AR gene (Xq11.12) and the X chromosome centromere. For AR activity, we performed a qualitative analysis of human androgen receptor activity. To analyze the expression of AR in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines, we used qPCR assays.  Results:   In the qPCR assay, we found downregulation of AR in the PC3 cell line compared with the LNCaP. We found the presence of X chromosome polysomy in PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines by FISH assay. In the HUMARA-Q assay, we found two X chromosomes/cell and the activity of both AR in the PC-3 cell line. In LNCaP cells, we found two X chromosomes/cell and methylation of only one AR.  Conclusion:   Castration-resistant prostate cancer phenotype represents a significant challenge in the setting of urological management. The X chromosomes and AR-linked alterations may contribute to a better understanding of the disease. However, further studies should be performed in an attempt to elucidate as much as possible the role of AR in the castration-resistant prostate cancer phenotype.""","""['P Romão', 'Í de Campos Souza', 'I Silva', 'V R Guimarães', 'J Alves de Camargo', 'G A Dos Santos', 'N I Viana', 'M Srougi', 'K R Moreira Leite', 'S T Reis', 'R Pimenta']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Double-layer omics analysis of castration- and X-ray-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'CH5137291, an androgen receptor nuclear translocation-inhibiting compound, inhibits the growth of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To report oncological outcomes and adverse events following focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for treating nonmetastatic prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   An analysis of 1379 patients with ≥6 mo of follow-up prospectively recorded in the HIFU Evaluation and Assessment of Treatment (HEAT) registry from 13 UK centres (2005-2020) was conducted. Five or more years of follow-up was available for 325 (24%) patients. Focal HIFU therapy used a transrectal ultrasound-guided device (Sonablate; Sonacare Inc., Charlotte, NC, USA).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Failure-free survival (FFS) was primarily defined as avoidance of no evidence of disease to require salvage whole-gland or systemic treatment, or metastases or prostate cancer-specific mortality. Differences in FFS between D'Amico risk groups were determined using a log-rank analysis. Adverse events were reported using Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results and limitations:   The median (interquartile range) age was 66 (60-71) yr and prostate-specific antigen was 6.9 (4.9-9.4) ng/ml with D'Amico intermediate risk in 65% (896/1379) and high risk in 28% (386/1379). The overall median follow-up was 32 (17-58) mo; for those with ≥5 yr of follow-up, it was 82 (72-94). A total of 252 patients had repeat focal treatment due to residual or recurrent cancer; overall 92 patients required salvage whole-gland treatment. Kaplan-Meier 7-yr FFS was 69% (64-74%). Seven-year FFS in intermediate- and high-risk cancers was 68% (95% confidence interval [CI] 62-75%) and 65% (95% CI 56-74%; p = 0.3). Clavien-Dindo >2 adverse events occurred in 0.5% (7/1379). The median 10-yr follow-up is lacking.  Conclusions:   Focal HIFU in carefully selected patients with clinically significant prostate cancer, with six and three of ten patients having, respectively, intermediate- and high-risk cancer, has good cancer control in the medium term.  Patient summary:   Focal high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment to areas of prostate with cancer can provide an alternative to treating the whole prostate.

Despite the increasing popularity of MBIs, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have examined their effects upon biological parameters. Specifically, no previous study has examined the effects of MBIs on extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are potentially important markers of health, disease, and stress. Moreover, the lack of RCTs is even more limited within the context of technology-mediated MBIs and long-term effects.  Methods:   The current study protocol presents a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled study investigating the effects of internet-supported mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Primary outcomes are psychological distress and EV cargo of distressed participants with previous breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer diagnoses. Secondary outcomes are self-reported psychosocial and health-related measures, and additional biological markers. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks after baseline (mid-point of the intervention), 8 weeks after baseline (immediately post-intervention), 24 weeks after baseline (after booster sessions), and 52 weeks after baseline. Our goal is to recruit at least 111 participants who have been diagnosed with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (cancer stage I to III), are between 18 and 65 years old, and have had primary cancer treatments completed between 3 months and 5 years ago. Half of the participants will be randomized to the TAU group, and the other half will participate in an 8-week online MBCT intervention with weekly group sessions via videoconference. The intervention also includes asynchronous homework, an online retreat after the fifth week, and 4 monthly booster sessions after completion of the 8-week programme.  Discussion:   This study will allow characterizing the effects of internet-based MBCT on psychosocial and biological indicators in the context of cancer. The effects on circulating EVs will also be investigated, as a possible neurobiological pathway underlying mind-body intervention effects.

In this study, our analysis in the TCGA database revealed high SNHG3 expression in PCa tissue. Further analysis in starBase, TargetScan, and mirDIP databases identified the SNHG3/miR-152-3p/SLC7A11 regulatory axis. FISH was conducted to assess the distribution of SNHG3 in PCa tissue. Dual-luciferase reporter gene and RIP assays confirmed the relationship among the three objects. Next, qRT-PCR and western blot were conducted to measure expression levels of SNHG3, miR-152-3p, and SLC7A11. CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell, and flow cytometry were carried out to assess proliferation, migration, invasion, methionine dependence, apoptosis, and the cell cycle. It was noted that SNHG3 as a molecular sponge of miR-152-3p stimulated proliferation, migration, and invasion, restrained methionine dependence and apoptosis, and affected the cell cycle of PCa cells via targeting SLC7A11. Additionally, we constructed xenograft tumor models in nude mice and confirmed that knockdown of SNHG3 could restrain PCa tumor growth and elevate methionine dependence in vivo.

To define tumor cell intrinsic factors that contribute to prostate cancer progression and resistance to ICB, we analyzed prostate cancer epithelial cells from castration-sensitive and -resistant samples using implanted tumors, cell lines, transgenic models and human tissue. We found that castration resulted in increased expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and its probable murine homolog Cxcl15 in prostate epithelial cells. We showed that these chemokines drove subsequent intratumoral infiltration of tumor-promoting polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs), which was largely abrogated when IL-8 signaling was blocked genetically or pharmacologically. Targeting IL-8 signaling in combination with ICB delayed the onset of castration resistance and increased the density of polyfunctional CD8 T cells in tumors.

In both separate and simultaneous forms, DOX and CUR were loaded with high efficiency and the release behavior of both drugs was pH-sensitive. The higher release rate was attained at pH 5.5 and 42 °C for DOX (80.23%) and CUR (13.06), respectively. The intensity of fluorescence in the free form of the drugs, was higher than the loaded form. In the same concentration, the free form of CUR and DOX were more toxic than the loaded form in all cell lines. Also, free drugs showed more impact on the expression of RB1 and CDK2 genes.

Metabolic alterations, including lipid metabolism, may reduce treatment efficacy, resulting in tumor relapse and poor therapeutic outcome. In the current study, we investigated the role of the lipophagy-related protein perilipin-3 (PLIN3) and the lysosomal acid lipase (LAL) in PCa response to radiation therapy.  Methods and materials:   We explored the in vitro and xenograft (in NOD SCID and R2G2 mice) response to radiation of either PLIN3-depleted or LAL-depleted hormone-refractory (DU145, PC3) and hormone-responsive (22Rv1) PCa cell lines. Moreover, we evaluated the clinical role of PLIN3 and LAL protein expression in a series of PCa tissue specimens from patients treated with radical radiation therapy.  Results:   In vitro and in vivo experiments showed reduced proliferation and strong radiosensitization of all studied PCa cell lines upon PLIN3 depletion. In vivo experiments demonstrated the significantly augmented radiation therapy efficacy upon PLIN3 depletion, resulting in extensive tissue necrosis. Overexpression of PLIN3 in tissue specimens was correlated with an increased MIB1 proliferation index, increased autophagy flux, reduced response to radiation therapy, and poor prognosis. The effect of LAL depletion on radiation therapy was of lesser importance.  Conclusions:   Assessment of PLIN3 expression may identify subgroups of patients with PCa who are less responsive to radiation therapy and at high risk of relapse after irradiation.

In this study, we demonstrate that retinoblastoma (Rb) family proteins play a central role in maintaining the global chromatin binding and transcriptional repression program of AR and that Rb inactivation desensitizes CRPC to the high-dose testosterone treatment in vitro and in vivo. Using a series of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) CRPC models, we further show that the efficacy of high-T treatment can be fully exploited by a CDK4/6 inhibitor, which strengthens the chromatin binding of the Rb-E2F repressor complex by blocking the hyperphosphorylation of Rb proteins.

However, acute activation of the UPR directly leads to tumor cell death. This study has shown that WJ-644A, a novel small molecule activator of UPR, potently inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and caused tumor regression with a good safety profile in multiple animal models.

Prostate cancer was the most common histology (69%). Most patients (63%) had received previous abdominopelvic radiotherapy (RT). SMART was delivered in 3-7 fractions based on planning target volume (PTV) location and previous dose exposures. For SMART, the baseline plan was recalculated on daily 3D MR-imaging (predicted plan), and plan adaptation was mandatory in case of planning objective violations.  Results:   Plan adaptation was mostly performed due to violation of planning objectives in the predicted plan (134/140 fractions, 96%) and significantly improved plan dosimetry: (1) PTV coverage was increased (predicted: median 89%, adapted: median 95%, p < 0.001), (2) organs-at-risk (OAR) overdoses were reduced (predicted: 27/140 (19%), adapted: 1/140 (1%), p < 0.001) and (3) PTV overdoses were reduced (predicted: 21/140 (15%), adapted: 1/140 (1%), p < 0.001).

Since rare diseases are often incorrectly diagnosed and managed, the aim of this study was to analyze the experience of a single urology center in the treatment of PUC, focusing on neoplasms arising from the male anterior urethra.  Materials and methods:   Medical records of patients with neoplasms at the level of the penile and bulbar urethra who presented at our tertiary referral center between January 1988 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with carcinoma of the prostatic urethra were excluded. The diagnosis was obtained with the aid of urethroscopy and lesion biopsy. Local staging was performed by means of contrast-enhanced MRI in selected patients. Staging was achieved by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and CT scan. Radical surgery (radical cystectomy + total penectomy + bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy) was proposed to patients with ≥T2 tumors or cN+ with a good performance status, proximal tumor and without severe comorbidities. In case of nodal involvement, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was additionally offered. Patients with localized disease (<T2) and/or more distal tumors underwent urethrectomy or partial penectomy. Kaplan-Meier curves were evaluated for analysis of overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS).  Results:   A total of 13 male patients with anterior PUC were studied retrospectively. Total penectomy was performed in 7 cases, while partial urethrectomy was performed in 5 cases, and partial penectomy in 1 case. Of the 7 patients who underwent total penectomy, 5 underwent radical cystectomy with bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy. Three patients were treated with neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy, of which 2 were cT3N+ and 1 was cT3N0. The predominant histologic subtype was squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), found in 7 patients (53.8%), while urothelial carcinoma (UC) was present in 5 patients (38.5%) and a malignant fibro-histiocytoma in 1 case. Most patients were diagnosed at advanced stages of the disease, with T2 tumors in 15.4% and T3 tumors in 46.2% of the cases. Median follow-up was 24 months (range 1-294). After surgical treatment, 8 patients (61.5%) presented disease recurrence after a median of 6.3 months, with a 5-year RFS of 58% ± 14%. The 5-year OS rate was 50% ± 14% while the 5-year CSS rate was 66% ± 13%.  Conclusion:   Given its rarity, urethral carcinoma should be treated in a referral center. Treatment options include a radical approach or penile-preserving surgery (urethrectomy or partial penectomy) in cases of localized disease. Due to the high recurrence rate, strict follow-up is mandatory.""","""['J F Calderón Cortez', 'A Territo', 'M Fontana', 'J M Gaya', 'F Sanguedolce', 'J Palou', 'J Huguet', 'A Breda']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Primary urethral carcinoma: Results from a single center experience.', 'Melanoma of the penis, scrotum and male urethra: a 40-year single institution experience.', 'Primary Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Male Proximal Urethra: Outcomes from a Single Centre.', 'A Challenging Surgical Approach to Locally Advanced Primary Urethral Carcinoma: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'EAU guidelines on primary urethral carcinoma.']"""

Objective:   The present study aimed at investigating these associations within the Göteborg-1 randomized, population-based PC screening trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   The screening arm of the Göteborg-1 screening trial comprises 10000 randomly selected men (aged 50-64 yr at randomization) from the Göteborg region of Sweden. Between 1995 and 2014, they were biennially invited to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing to an upper age limit of 70 yr (range 67-71 yr). PSA ≥3 ng/ml triggered a prostate biopsy (sextant biopsy 1995-2009, thereafter a ten-core biopsy).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The impact of age on Gleason score, given a screen-detected PC, was investigated with multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for year of testing and screening round.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 7625 men had at least one PSA test and 1022 men were diagnosed with PC. For men with screen-detected PC, age was associated with the risk of clinically significant PC above and beyond screening round and year of testing (p < 0.001). For each 1-yr increase in age, the risk of being diagnosed with a Gleason score ≥3 + 4 cancer (vs <7) increased by 11% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-17), whereas the risk of being diagnosed with a Gleason score ≥4 + 3 cancer (vs <7) increased by 8.5% (95% CI -1.6 to 20).  Conclusions:   The increased risk of a higher Gleason score in older men should be considered when counseling men regarding early diagnosis and treatment for PC.

Methods and materials:   Fifteen patients treated with SBRT via the CyberKnife system (36.25 Gy/5 fractions) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Two magnetic resonance (MR) images were obtained with a hydrogel spacer: one on a computed tomography (CT) simulation day (MR pretreatment [MRpre]) and the other on the last treatment day (MR posttreatment [MRpost]). Two medical physicists contoured the hydrogel spacer on each MR image. The changes of the shapes and the volume for the hydrogel spacer between 2 MR images were evaluated.  Results:   The median period between hydrogel spacer injection and CT simulation was 1 day (range, 1-9 days). The median period between CT simulation and the last treatment was 17 days (range, 14-25 days). Regarding the volume change of the hydrogel spacer, the 2 observers observed significant differences between the volumes of the hydrogel spacer on the MRpre and MRpost. However, the average volume difference between them was less than 1 cm3. The average dice similarity coefficient between the MRpre and MRpost to compare the shape was more than 0.83.

However, China is experiencing a transition in its cancer profiles, with greater incidence of cancers that were previously more common in the USA. This study compared the latest cancer profiles, trends, and determinants between China and USA.  Methods:   This was a comparative study using open-source data. Cancer cases and deaths in 2022 were calculated using cancer estimates from GLOBOCAN 2020 and population estimates from the United Nations. Trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates in the USA used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and National Center for Health Statistics. Chinese data were obtained from cancer registry reports. Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 and a decomposition method were used to express cancer deaths as the product of four determinant factors.  Results:   In 2022, there will be approximately 4,820,000 and 2,370,000 new cancer cases, and 3,210,000 and 640,000 cancer deaths in China and the USA, respectively. The most common cancers are lung cancer in China and breast cancer in the USA, and lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both. Age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for lung cancer and colorectal cancer in the USA have decreased significantly recently, but rates of liver cancer have increased slightly. Rates of stomach, liver, and esophageal cancer decreased gradually in China, but rates have increased for colorectal cancer in the whole population, prostate cancer in men, and other seven cancer types in women. Increases in adult population size and population aging were major determinants for incremental cancer deaths, and case-fatality rates contributed to reduced cancer deaths in both countries.  Conclusions:   The decreasing cancer burden in liver, stomach, and esophagus, and increasing burden in lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate, mean that cancer profiles in China and the USA are converging. Population aging is a growing determinant of incremental cancer burden. Progress in cancer prevention and care in the USA, and measures to actively respond to population aging, may help China to reduce the cancer burden.""","""['Changfa Xia', 'Xuesi Dong', 'He Li', 'Maomao Cao', 'Dianqin Sun', 'Siyi He', 'Fan Yang', 'Xinxin Yan', 'Shaoli Zhang', 'Ni Li', 'Wanqing Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['Changing profiles of cancer burden worldwide and in China: a secondary analysis of the global cancer statistics 2020.', 'Global patterns of breast cancer incidence and mortality: A population-based cancer registry data analysis from 2000 to 2020.', 'The updated incidences and mortalities of major cancers in China, 2011.', 'Cancer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020: a review of current estimates of the national burden, data gaps, and future needs.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Advancement and Applications of Nanotherapy for Cancer Immune Microenvironment.', 'Proteomics-based identification of proteins in tumor-derived exosomes as candidate biomarkers for colorectal cancer.', 'Collagen-related gene expression level predicts the prognosis and immune therapy response.', 'Acupuncture improves immunity and fatigue after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients by inhibiting the Leptin/AMPK signaling pathway.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.']"""

The quantitative imaging biomarkers alliance (QIBA) profile for quantitative DWI claims a within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) for prostate lesion ADC of 0.17. Improved understanding of ADC reproducibility would aid the use of quantitative diffusion in prostate MRI evaluation.  Purpose:   Evaluation of the repeatability (same-day) and reproducibility (multi-day) of whole-prostate and focal-lesion ADC assessment in a multi-site setting.  Study type:   Prospective multi-institutional.  Subjects:   Twenty-nine males, ages 53 to 80 (median 63) years, following diagnosis of prostate cancer, 10 with focal lesions.  Field strength/sequence:   3T, single-shot spin-echo diffusion-weighted echo-planar sequence with four b-values.  Assessment:   Sites qualified for the study using an ice-water phantom with known ADC. Readers performed DWI analyses at visit 1 (""V1"") and visit 2 (""V2,"" 2-14 days after V1), where V2 comprised scans before (""V2pre"") and after (""V2post"") a ""coffee-break"" interval with subject removal and repositioning. A single reader segmented the whole prostate. Two readers separately placed region-of-interests for focal lesions.  Statistical tests:   Reproducibility and repeatability coefficients for whole prostate and focal lesions derived from median pixel ADC. We estimated the wCV and 95% confidence interval using a variance stabilizing transformation and assessed interreader reliability of focal lesion ADC using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results:   The ADC biases from b0 -b600 and b0 -b800 phantom scans averaged 1.32% and 1.44%, respectively; mean b-value dependence was 0.188%. Repeatability and reproducibility of whole prostate median pixel ADC both yielded wCVs of 0.033 (N = 29). In 10 subjects with an evaluable focal lesion, the individual reader wCVs were 0.148 and 0.074 (repeatability) and 0.137 and 0.078 (reproducibility). All time points demonstrated good to excellent interreader reliability for focal lesion ADC (ICCV1 = 0.89; ICCV2pre = 0.76; ICCV2post = 0.94).  Data conclusion:   This study met the QIBA claim for prostate ADC. Test-retest repeatability and multi-day reproducibility were largely equivalent.

Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths for Black people in the United States and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence (herein through 2018), mortality (through 2019), survival, screening, and risk factors using population-based data from the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In 2022, there will be approximately 224,080 new cancer cases and 73,680 cancer deaths among Black people in the United States. During the most recent 5-year period, Black men had a 6% higher incidence rate but 19% higher mortality than White men overall, including an approximately 2-fold higher risk of death from myeloma, stomach cancer, and prostate cancer. The overall cancer mortality disparity is narrowing between Black and White men because of a steeper drop in Black men for lung and prostate cancers. However, the decline in prostate cancer mortality in Black men slowed from 5% annually during 2010 through 2014 to 1.3% during 2015 through 2019, likely reflecting the 5% annual increase in advanced-stage diagnoses since 2012. Black women have an 8% lower incidence rate than White women but a 12% higher mortality; further, mortality rates are 2-fold higher for endometrial cancer and 41% higher for breast cancer despite similar or lower incidence rates. The wide breast cancer disparity reflects both later stage diagnosis (57% localized stage vs 67% in White women) and lower 5-year survival overall (82% vs 92%, respectively) and for every stage of disease (eg, 20% vs 30%, respectively, for distant stage).

Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCVAC/PCa plus chemotherapy followed by DCVAC/PCa maintenance treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Design, setting, and participants:   The VIABLE double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, phase 3 randomized clinical trial enrolled patients with mCRPC among 177 hospital clinics in the US and Europe between June 2014 and November 2017. Data analyses were performed from December 2019 to July 2020.  Interventions:   Eligible patients were randomized (2:1) to receive DCVAC/PCa (add-on and maintenance) or placebo, both in combination with chemotherapy (docetaxel plus prednisone). The stratification was applied according to geographical region (US or non-US), prior therapy (abiraterone, enzalutamide, or neither), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0-1 or 2). DCVAC/PCa or placebo was administered subcutaneously every 3 to 4 weeks (up to 15 doses).  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), defined as the time from randomization until death due to any cause, in all randomized patients. Survival was compared using 2-sided log-rank test stratified by geographical region, prior therapy with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status.  Results:   A total of 1182 men with mCRPC (median [range] age, 68 [46-89] years) were randomized to receive DCVAC/PCa (n = 787) or placebo (n = 395). Of these, 610 (81.8%) started DCVAC/PCa, and 376 (98.4%) started placebo. There was no difference in OS between the DCVAC/PCa and placebo groups in all randomized patients (median OS, 23.9 months [95% CI, 21.6-25.3] vs 24.3 months [95% CI, 22.6-26.0]; hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.90-1.21; P = .60). No differences in the secondary efficacy end points (radiological progression-free survival, time to prostate-specific antigen progression, or skeletal-related events) were observed. Treatment-emergent adverse events related to DCVAC/PCa or placebo occurred in 69 of 749 (9.2%) and 48 of 379 (12.7%) patients, respectively. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (DCVAC/PCa [n = 749] vs placebo [n = 379]) were fatigue (271 [36.2%] vs 152 [40.1%]), alopecia (222 [29.6%] vs 130 [34.3%]), and diarrhea (206 [27.5%] vs 117 [30.9%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this phase 3 randomized clinical trial, DCVAC/PCa combined with docetaxel plus prednisone and continued as maintenance treatment did not extend OS in patients with mCRPC and was well tolerated.

In this study, we demonstrated that mannose inhibits the proliferation and promotes the apoptosis of PCa cells in vitro, and mannose was observed to have an anticancer effect in mice without harming their health. Accumulation of intracellular mannose simultaneously decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in PCa cells. Mannose treatment of PCa cells induced changes in mitochondrial morphology, caused dysregulated expression of the fission protein, such as fission, mitochondrial 1 (FIS1), and enhanced the expression of proapoptotic factors, such as BCL2-associated X (Bax) and BCL2-antagonist/killer 1 (Bak). Furthermore, lower expression of mannose phosphate isomerase (MPI), the key enzyme in mannose metabolism, indicated poorer prognosis in PCa patients, and downregulation of MPI expression in PCa cells enhanced the anticancer effect of mannose.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of prostate carcinoma patients with a Gleason score (GS) of 3+4 or higher who underwent prostate MRI using a 3T unit at our institution. They were divided into two groups based on the use of ERC for MRI acquisition, and patients who underwent prostate MRI with an ERC constituted the ERC (n = 55) data set, while the remaining patients accounted for the non-ERC data set (n = 41). DWI was performed with b-values of 50, 500, 1000, and 1,400 s/mm2, and ADC maps were automatically calculated. Additionally, computed DWI (cDWI) was performed with a b-value of 2000 s/mm2. Six ADC and two cDWI parameters were evaluated. In the ERC data set, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for each metric to determine the best cutoff threshold values for differentiating GS 3+4 PCa from that with a higher GS. The performance of these cutoff values was assessed in non-ERC dataset. The diagnostic accuracies and area under the curves (AUCs) of the metrics were compared using Fisher's exact test and De Long's method, respectively.  Results:   Among all metrics, the ADCmean-ratio yielded the highest AUC, 0.84, for differing GS 3+4 PCa from that with a higher GS. The best threshold cutoff values of ADCmean-ratio (£0.51) for discriminating GS 3+4 PCa from that with a higher GS classified 48 patients out of 55 with an accuracy of 87.27%. However, there was no significant difference between each metric in terms of accuracy and AUC (p = 0.163 and 0.214). Similarly, in the non-ERC data set, the ADCmean-ratio provided the highest diagnostic accuracy (82.92%) by classifying 34 patients out of 41. However, Fisher's exact test yielded no significant difference between DWI and ADC metrics in terms of diagnostic accuracy in non-ERC data (p = 0.561).

The mechanism through which resistance to androgen deprivation in PCa is developed remains largely unknown. Our understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and key signaling pathways between tumors and their TME is currently changing in light of the generation of new knowledge with regard to cancer progression. A disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 9 (ADAM9) is a membranous bridge forming cell-cell and cell-matrix connections that regulate tumor aggressiveness and metastasis. However, it is not known whether ADAM9 expressed in the TME contributes to the CRPC phenotype. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression patterns of ADAM9 in prostate cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We also intended to elucidate the effects of both stromal cell- and cancer cell-derived ADAM9 on the progression of CRPC and the implicated molecular pathways. By using both clinical specimens and cell lines, we herein showed that unlike the membrane anchored ADAM9 overexpressed by both PCa cells and prostate CAFs, the secreted isoform of ADAM9 (sADAM9) was strongly detected in CAFs, but rarely in tumor cells, and that could be a serum marker for PCa patients. We demonstrated that functionally sADAM9 are characterized as chemoattractant for the directed movement of androgen-independent PCa cells through integrin downstream FAK/AKT pathway, supporting that elevated sADAM9 by prostate CAFs could be responsible for the promotion of CRPC metastasis. Moreover, by stimulating PCa cells with sADAM9, we found that ubinuclein-2 (UBN2) expression was increased. A positive correlation of ADAM9 and UBN2 expression was observed in androgen receptor-expressing PCa cell lines and further confirmed in clinical PCa specimens. Using a genetic modification approach, we identified UBN2 as a downstream target gene of ADAM9 that is critical for the survival of androgen-dependent PCa cells in response to androgen deprivation, through the induction and effect of the aldo-keto reductase family 1 member C3 (AKR1C3). Collectively, our results reveal a novel action of ADAM9 on the transition of androgen-dependent PCa cells into an androgen-independent manner through the UBN2/AKR1C3 axis; the aforementioned action could contribute to the clinically-observed acquired androgen-deprivation therapy resistance.""","""['Trang Thi-Huynh Le', 'Chia-Ling Hsieh', 'I-Hsuan Lin', 'Cheng-Ying Chu', 'Anh Duy Do', 'Seu-Hwa Chen', 'Katsumi Shigemura', 'Koichi Kitagawa', 'Masato Fujisawa', 'Ming-Che Liu', 'Kuan-Chou Chen', 'Shian-Ying Sung']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""['Loss of exosomal miR-146a-5p from cancer-associated fibroblasts after androgen deprivation therapy contributes to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate tumor growth and progression through upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis.', 'Inhibitory Interplay of SULT2B1b Sulfotransferase with AKR1C3 Aldo-keto Reductase in Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, it lacks specificity, and its inter-reader reproducibility remains moderate. Biomarkers, such as the Prostate Health Index (PHI), may help select patients for prostate biopsy. Computer-aided diagnosis/detection (CAD) systems may also improve mpMRI interpretation. Different prototypes of CAD systems are currently developed under the Recherche Hospitalo-Universitaire en Santé / Personalized Focused Ultrasound Surgery of Localized Prostate Cancer (RHU PERFUSE) research programme, tackling challenging issues such as robustness across imaging protocols and magnetic resonance (MR) vendors, and ability to characterise cancer aggressiveness. The study primary objective is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final CAD system as compared with the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System V.2.1 (PI-RADS V.2.1) in predicting the presence of ISUP ≥2 prostate cancer in patients undergoing prostate biopsy.  Methods:   This prospective, multicentre, non-inferiority trial will include 420 men with suspected prostate cancer, a prostate-specific antigen level of ≤30 ng/mL and a clinical stage ≤T2 c. Included men will undergo prostate mpMRI that will be interpreted using the PI-RADS V.2.1 score. Then, they will undergo systematic and targeted biopsy. PHI will be assessed before biopsy. At the end of patient inclusion, MR images will be assessed by the final version of the CAD system developed under the RHU PERFUSE programme. Key secondary outcomes include the prediction of ISUP grade ≥2 prostate cancer during a 3-year follow-up, and the number of biopsy procedures saved and ISUP grade ≥2 cancers missed by several diagnostic pathways combining PHI and MRI findings.  Ethics and dissemination:   Ethical approval was obtained from the Comité de Protection des Personnes Nord Ouest III (ID-RCB: 2020-A02785-34).

Here we introduce a method, Bias Reduction through Analysis of Competing Events (BRACE), to reduce bias in the presence of residual confounding.  Experimental design:   BRACE is a novel method for adjusting for bias from residual confounding in proportional hazards models. Using standard simulation methods, we compared BRACE with Cox proportional hazards regression in the presence of an unmeasured confounder. We examined estimator distributions, bias, mean squared error (MSE), and coverage probability. We then estimated treatment effects of high versus low intensity treatments in 36,630 prostate cancer, 4,069 lung cancer, and 7,117 head/neck cancer patients, using the Veterans Affairs database. We analyzed treatment effects on cancer-specific mortality (CSM), noncancer mortality (NCM), and overall survival (OS), using conventional multivariable Cox and propensity score (adjusted using inverse probability weighting) models, versus BRACE-adjusted estimates.  Results:   In simulations with residual confounding, BRACE uniformly reduced both bias and MSE. In the absence of bias, BRACE introduced bias toward the null, albeit with lower MSE. BRACE markedly improved coverage probability, but with a tendency toward overcorrection for effective but nontoxic treatments. For each clinical cohort, more intensive treatments were associated with significantly reduced hazards for CSM, NCM, and OS. BRACE attenuated OS estimates, yielding results more consistent with findings from randomized trials and meta-analyses.

We investigated patient-related risk factors for late rectal bleeding after hypofractionated radiotherapy.  Methods:   A total of 231 patients with local or locally advanced prostate cancer treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy (70 or 67.2 Gy in 28 fractions) were evaluated retrospectively. All patients received intensity-modulated radiotherapy with daily image guidance. The relationships between late rectal bleeding and risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, cirrhosis, and anticoagulant use were analyzed.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 23 months, the crude rates of grade ≥ 1, grade ≥ 2, and grade ≥ 3 late rectal bleeding were 23.8%, 16.9%, and 9.5%, respectively. Cirrhosis and anticoagulant use predicted an increased risk of grade ≥ 3 rectal bleeding in multivariable analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 14.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.09-66.87, P = 0.001, and HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.14-7.55, P = 0.026, respectively). The non-anticoagulant group had a significantly superior 5-year freedom from grade ≥ 3 bleeding compared to the anticoagulant group in a propensity-weighted log-rank analysis (88.0% vs. 76.7%, P = 0.041). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that rectal bleeding was minimized in the anticoagulant group if the equivalent dose at fractionation of 2 Gy (EQD2) V77 Gy of the rectum was < 4.5% or if the EQD2 V8.2 Gy was < 71.0%.

This paper provides a complete overview of RARP long-term oncologic and functional results produced in an Italian spoke hospital.  Methods:   From December 2004 to December 2010, 300 consecutive patients with prostate cancer were treated with extraperitoneal RARP. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), salvage therapy-free survival (STFS), prostate cancer specific survival (PCa-SS), and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of BCR and ST. Crude rates of continence and potency recovery after surgery were reported.  Results:   Median follow-up was 135.6 months (IQR 20-184). At 15 years, BCR-FS, ST-FS, PCa-SS, and OS rates were 78% (95% CI 0.73-0.83), 85% (95% CI 0.81 -0.89), 98% (95% CI 0.97-100), and 89% (95% CI 0.84-0.94), respectively.

Material and methods:   We used 1872 billing codes in EHRs of 102 880 patients from 12 healthcare systems. Using tools borrowed from single-cell omics, we mitigated center-specific batch effects and performed clustering to identify patients with highly similar medical history patterns across the various centers. Our visualization method (PheSpec) depicts the phenotypic profile of clusters, applies a novel filtering of noninformative codes (Ranked Scope Pervasion), and indicates the most distinguishing features.  Results:   We observed 114 clinically meaningful profiles, for example, linking prostate hyperplasia with cancer and diabetes with cardiovascular problems and grouping pediatric developmental disorders. Our framework identified disease subsets, exemplified by 6 ""other headache"" clusters, where phenotypic profiles suggested different underlying mechanisms: migraine, convulsion, injury, eye problems, joint pain, and pituitary gland disorders. Phenotypic patterns replicated well, with high correlations of ≥0.75 to an average of 6 (2-8) of the 12 different cohorts, demonstrating the consistency with which our method discovers disease history profiles.  Discussion:   Costly clinical research ventures should be based on solid hypotheses. We repurpose methods from single-cell omics to build these hypotheses from observational EHR data, distilling useful information from complex data.

The long non-coding RNA TP73-AS1 has been shown to be involved in the malignant transformation of various human cancers. However, whether TP73-AS1 contributes to prostate cancer progression has not been reported yet. Accordingly, here we aimed to report the role of TP73-AS1 in the development and progression of prostate cancer and determine its relationship with TP73.  Methods and results:   TP73-AS1-specific siRNA oligo duplexes were used to silence TP73-AS1 in DU-145 and PC-3 cells. Results indicated that TP73-AS1 was upregulated whereas TP73 was downregulated in prostate cancer cells compared to normal prostate cells and there was a negative correlation between them. Besides, loss of function experiments of TP73-AS1 in prostate cancer cells strongly induced cellular apoptosis, interfered with the cell cycle progression, and modulated related pro- and anti-apoptotic gene expression. Colony formation and migration capacities of TP73-AS1-silenced prostate cancer cells were also found to be dramatically reduced.

Primary outcome was the adjusted risk of any cancer after the first THA; secondary outcomes were specific cancer forms.  Results:   We found no enhanced adjusted risk of developing any cancer, either in exposed females compared with unexposed females (hazard ratio [HR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95-1.2), or in exposed males (HR 1.1, CI 0.99-1.2). When analysing specific cancers, increased adjusted risks were found for thyroid and pancreas cancer in exposed females, and for cancer of the stomach, skin melanoma, and prostate cancer in exposed males.

These illnesses, such as various forms of cancer, are often associated with poor prognoses, prompting the need for more comprehensive characterization of the glycoproteome. While innovative instrumental and computational strategies have largely benefited glycoproteomic analyses, less attention is given to benefits gained through alternative, optimized chromatographic techniques. Porous graphitic carbon (PGC) chromatography has gained considerable interest in glycomics research due to its mobile phase flexibility, increased retention of polar analytes, and improved structural elucidation at higher temperatures. PGC has yet to be systematically compared against or in tandem with standard reversed phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) in high-throughput bottom-up glycoproteomic experiments, leaving the potential benefits unexplored. Performing comparative analysis of single and biphasic separation regimes at a range of column temperatures illustrates complementary advantages for each method. PGC separation is shown to selectively retain shorter, more hydrophilic glycopeptide species, imparting higher average charge, and exhibiting greater microheterogeneity coverage for identified glycosites. Additionally, we demonstrate that liquid-phase separation of glycopeptide isomers may be achieved through both single and biphasic PGC separations, providing a means towards facile, multidimensional glycopeptide characterization. Beyond this, we demonstrate how utilization of multiple separation regimes and column temperatures can aid in profiling the glycoproteome in tumorigenic and aggressive prostate cancer cells.

Within the current study, we analyzed irradiation-induced plasticity within the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive (ALDH+) population in prostate cancer. The radiosensitivity of xenograft tumors derived from ALDH+ and ALDH-negative (ALDH-) cells was determined with local tumor control analyses and demonstrated different dose-response profiles, time to relapse, and focal adhesion signaling. The transcriptional heterogeneity was analyzed in pools of 10 DU145 and PC3 cells with multiplex gene expression analyses and illustrated a higher degree of heterogeneity within the ALDH+ population that even increases upon irradiation in comparison with ALDH- cells. Phenotypic conversion and clonal competition were analyzed with fluorescence protein-labeled cells to distinguish cellular origins in competitive three-dimensional cultures and xenograft tumors. We found that the ALDH+ population outcompetes ALDH- cells and drives tumor growth, in particular upon irradiation. The observed dynamics of the cellular state compositions between ALDH+ and ALDH- cells in vivo before and after tumor irradiation was reproduced by a probabilistic Markov compartment model that incorporates cellular plasticity, clonal competition, and phenotype-specific radiosensitivities. Transcriptional analyses indicate that the cellular conversion from ALDH- into ALDH+ cells within xenograft tumors under therapeutic pressure was partially mediated through induction of the transcriptional repressor SNAI2. In summary, irradiation-induced cellular conversion events are present in xenograft tumors derived from prostate cancer cells and may be responsible for radiotherapy failure.

In prostate cancer, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are major contributors of secreted lactate, which can be taken up by cancer cells to sustain mitochondrial metabolism. However, how lactate impacts transcriptional regulation in tumors has yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we describe a mechanism by which CAF-secreted lactate is able to increase the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism in prostate cancer cells. This regulation enhanced intracellular lipid accumulation in lipid droplets (LD) and provided acetyl moieties for histone acetylation, establishing a regulatory loop between metabolites and epigenetic modification. Inhibition of this loop by targeting the bromodomain and extraterminal protein family of histone acetylation readers suppressed the expression of perilipin 2 (PLIN2), a crucial component of LDs, disrupting lactate-dependent lipid metabolic rewiring. Inhibition of this CAF-induced metabolic-epigenetic regulatory loop in vivo reduced growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells, demonstrating its translational relevance as a therapeutic target in prostate cancer. Clinically, PLIN2 expression was elevated in tumors with a higher Gleason grade and in castration-resistant prostate cancer compared with primary prostate cancer. Overall, these findings show that lactate has both a metabolic and an epigenetic role in promoting prostate cancer progression.  Significance:   This work shows that stromal-derived lactate induces accumulation of lipid droplets, stimulates epigenetic rewiring, and fosters metastatic potential in prostate cancer.""","""['Luigi Ippolito#', 'Giuseppina Comito#', 'Matteo Parri', 'Marta Iozzo', 'Assia Duatti', 'Francesca Virgilio', 'Nicla Lorito', 'Marina Bacci', 'Elisa Pardella', 'Giada Sandrini', 'Francesca Bianchini', 'Roberta Damiano', 'Lavinia Ferrone', 'Giancarlo la Marca', 'Sergio Serni', 'Pietro Spatafora', 'Carlo V Catapano', 'Andrea Morandi', 'Elisa Giannoni#', 'Paola Chiarugi#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Reciprocal metabolic reprogramming through lactate shuttle coordinately influences tumor-stroma interplay.', 'Lactate modulates CD4+ T-cell polarization and induces an immunosuppressive environment, which sustains prostate carcinoma progression via TLR8/miR21 axis.', 'A reciprocal role of prostate cancer on stromal DNA damage.', 'Lipid Metabolism and Epigenetics Crosstalk in Prostate Cancer.', 'Lactate transporters in the context of prostate cancer metabolism: what do we know?', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts: from basic science to anticancer therapy.', 'Cancer metabolites: promising biomarkers for cancer liquid biopsy.', 'Heterogeneity of cancer-associated fibroblasts in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Orchestral role of lipid metabolic reprogramming in T-cell malignancy.']"""

The survey was answered by 62.32% of the 69 physicians surveyed (urologists, oncologists, radiation therapists, radiologists, and pathologists). The 88.4% consider the duration of the meetings appropriate. There are disparate opinions concerning the protection of the MDT meeting time as well as protocol update.

Published data suggest that a low T level is an independent predictor of higher-grade prostate cancer (PC).  Aim:   To evaluate the relationship between T and PSA in patients with PC.  Methods:   All men diagnosed with PC with a recorded pre-treatment total T level measurement were included in this analysis. We analyzed demographic, clinical, and pathological data. Patients were stratified according to pretreatment PSA levels: <2 ng/mL, 2-4 ng/mL, >4 ng/mL. Low T was defined as total T < 10.4 nmol/L (300 ng/dL), very low T < 6.9 nmol/L (200 ng/dL).  Outcomes:   T levels by PSA groups according to the PC pathology.  Results:   In this retrospective study, mean patient age was 61 years among 646 men. The distribution by PSA group was: 8% (<2), 17% (2-4), and 76% (>4). The mean T level across the entire cohort was 13 nmol/L (374 ng/dL). Overall, 30% had a T level < 10.4 nmol/L (300 ng/dL). The mean total T level by PSA group was: <2 ng/mL, 7 nmol/L (206 ng/dL); 2-4 ng/mL, 13 nmol/L (362 ng/dL); >4 ng/mL, 14 nmol/L (393 ng/dL), P < .001. PSA <4 ng/mL was a significant predictor of low T in men with PC GS ≥8. PSA <2 ng/mL was a significant predictor of very low T independent of the PC pathology.  Clinical implications:   These findings suggest that clinicians should consider measuring T levels when a patient diagnosed with PC GS ≥8 and PSA level <4 ng/mL, and for each patient with PSA level <2 ng/mL independent of the PC pathology.  Strengths & limitations:   Our study has several strengths including (i) inclusion of a large population of men, (ii) use of a database which is audited and reviewed for accuracy annually, and (iii) use of an accurate T assay (LCMS). Nonetheless, there are limitations: (i) the subjects of the study are from a single institution, and (ii) we did not measure free T levels.  Conclusion:   In men with PC with GS ≥8, PSA level <4 ng/mL predicts low T. PSA <2 ng/mL predicts very low T independent of the PC pathology. Flores JM, Bernie HL, Miranda E, et al.

However, pyroptosis research in prostate cancer (PCa) has rarely been reported.  Methods:   The expression profile and corresponding clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases. Patients were divided into different clusters using consensus clustering analysis, and differential genes were obtained. We developed and validated a prognostic biomarker for biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa using univariate Cox analysis, Lasso-Cox analysis, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival analysis, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.  Results:   The expression levels of most pyroptosis-related genes (PRGs) are different not only between normal and tumor tissues but also between different clusters. Cluster 2 patients have a better prognosis than cluster 1 patients, and there are significant differences in immune cell content and biological pathway between them. Based on the classification of different clusters, we constructed an eight genes signature that can independently predict the progression-free survival (PFS) rate of a patient, and this signature was validated using a GEO data set (GSE70769). Finally, we established a nomogram model with good accuracy.  Conclusions:   In this study, PRGs were used as the starting point and based on the expression profile and clinical data, a prognostic signature with a high predictive value for biochemical recurrence (BCR) following radical prostatectomy (RP) was finally constructed, and the relationship between pyroptosis, immune microenvironment, and PCa was explored, providing important clues for future research on pyroptosis and immunity.""","""['Ding Hu#', 'Qingfei Cao#', 'Ming Tong#', 'Chundong Ji#', 'Zizhi Li', 'Weichao Huang', 'Yanyang Jin', 'Guangquan Tong', 'Yutao Wang', 'Pengfei Li', 'Huashan Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Pyroptosis related genes signature predicts prognosis and immune infiltration of tumor microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Identification of a pyroptosis-related prognostic signature in breast cancer.', 'A Novel Set of Immune-associated Gene Signature predicts Biochemical Recurrence in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'A pyroptosis-related gene signature predicts prognosis and immune microenvironment in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Combination of ferroptosis and pyroptosis to construct a prognostic classifier and predict immune landscape, chemotherapeutic efficacy and immunosuppressive molecules in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Membrane tension-mediated stiff and soft tumor subtypes closely associated with prognosis for prostate cancer patients.', 'Relationship between pyroptosis-mediated inflammation and the pathogenesis of prostate disease.', 'A novel signature based on pyroptosis-related genes for predicting prognosis and treatment response in prostate cancer patients.', 'Identification of pyroptosis-related lncRNA signature and AC005253.1 as a pyroptosis-related oncogene in prostate cancer.', 'A newly identified pyroptosis-related gene signature for predicting prognosis of patients with hepatocellular cancer.']"""

Methods:   Simulations based on annual updates of vital status, CCI and DCI were used to estimate life expectancy at population level. The probabilities of these transitions were determined from generalised linear models using prostate cancer-free comparison men in PCBaSe Sweden. A simulation was performed for each combination of age, CCI, and DCI. Survival curves were created and compared to observed survival. Life expectancy was then calculated as the area under the simulated survival curve.  Results:   There was good agreement between observed and simulated survival curves for most ages and comorbidities, except for younger men. With increasing age and comorbidity, there was a decrease in life expectancy. Cross-validation based on six regions in Sweden also showed that simulated and observed survival was similar.

The chances to prevent and/or survive the disease chiefly hinge on adopting a form of cancer-biopedagogy, which entails a composite entanglement of knowledge and health-related practices underpinned by the ethnicization of cancer through the consumption of ""traditional food"" (washoku) and the assumption that turning into a ""healthy self"" is determined by Japanese ethnic traits.

The Oncology Care Model (OCM) offers oncology practices financial incentives to improve the value of cancer care. We assessed the impact of OCM on adherence to oral cancer therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), prostate cancer, and breast cancer.  Methods:   Using 2014-2019 Medicare data, we studied chemotherapy episodes for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries prescribed tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for CML, antiandrogens (ie, enzalutamide, abiraterone) for prostate cancer, or hormonal therapies for breast cancer in OCM-participating and propensity-matched comparison practices. We measured adherence as the proportion of days covered and used difference-in-difference (DID) models to detect changes in adherence over time, adjusting for patient, practice, and market-level characteristics.  Results:   There was no overall impact of OCM on improved adherence to TKIs for CML (DID = -0.3%, 90% confidence interval [CI] = -1.2% to 0.6%), antiandrogens for prostate cancer (DID = 0.4%, 90% CI = -0.3% to 1.2%), or hormonal therapy for breast cancer (DID = 0.0%, 90% CI = -0.2% to 0.2%). Among episodes for Black beneficiaries in OCM practices, for whom adherence was lower than for White beneficiaries at baseline, we observed small improvements in adherence to high cost TKIs (DID = 3.0%, 90% CI = 0.2% to 5.8%) and antiandrogens (DID = 2.2%, 90% CI = 0.2% to 4.3%).  Conclusions:   OCM did not impact adherence to oral cancer therapies for Medicare beneficiaries with CML, prostate cancer, or breast cancer overall but modestly improved adherence to high-cost TKIs and antiandrogens for Black beneficiaries, who had somewhat lower adherence than White beneficiaries at baseline.

The majority of PCas are androgen-sensitive, with a significant up-regulation of Androgen Receptor (AR) that causes a stimulatory effect on growth and progression of cancer cells. For this reason, the first-line therapy for PCa is androgen ablation, even if it ultimately fails due to the onset of hormone-refractory state, in which the malignant cells do not sense the androgen signal anymore. Besides androgens, a growing number of evidence suggests that Thyroid Hormones (THs) mediate tumor-promoting effects in a variety of human cancers, as Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), invasion and metastasis and also stimulation of angiogenesis and tumor metabolism. Moreover, epidemiological studies demonstrated an increased risk for PCa in patients with lower levels of Thyreotropin (TSH). Here, we investigated if intracellular TH metabolism affects Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa formation and progression. We found that the intracellular TH metabolism is a crucial determinant of PCa behavior. We observed that a dynamic stage-specific expression of the THs modulating enzymes, the deiodinases, is required for the progression of BPH to PCa malignancy. By acting simultaneously on epithelial cancer cells and fibroblasts, THs exert a proliferative and pro-inflammatory effect cooperating with androgens. These findings suggest that androgens and THs may interplay and mediate a coordinate effect on human PCa formation and progression. In light of our results, future perspective could be to explore the potential benefits of THs intracellular modulators aimed to counteract PCa progression.""","""['Caterina Miro', 'Angelo Di Giovanni', 'Melania Murolo', 'Annunziata Gaetana Cicatiello', 'Annarita Nappi', 'Serena Sagliocchi', 'Emery Di Cicco', 'Francesco Morra', 'Angela Celetti', 'Francesco Pacifico', 'Ciro Imbimbo', 'Felice Crocetto', 'Monica Dentice']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'βKlotho inhibits androgen/androgen receptor‑associated epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer through inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling.', 'Expressions of the androgen receptor in normal prostate, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Stromal androgen receptor roles in the development of normal prostate, benign prostate hyperplasia, and prostate cancer.', 'Genetically predicted alterations in thyroid function are associated with the risk of benign prostatic disease.', 'The Efficacy of Flogofilm® in the Treatment of Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis as an Adjuvant to Antibiotic Therapy: A Randomized Prospective Trial.', 'Overview of BPH: Symptom Relief with Dietary Polyphenols, Vitamins and Phytochemicals by Nutraceutical Supplements with Implications to the Prostate Microbiome.', 'The androgen-thyroid hormone crosstalk in prostate cancer and the clinical implications.', 'Loss of p53 activates thyroid hormone via type 2 deiodinase and enhances DNA damage.']"""

Neuropeptide substance P (SP) acting via neurokinin-1receptor (NK1R) promotes tumorigenicity in many human malignant tumors. However, its pro-tumorigenic functions and the therapeutic effects of its inhibition in prostate cancer remain unclear.  Methods:   MTT assay was employed for measuring cellular proliferation and cytotoxicity. mRNAs and proteins expression levels were evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot assay, respectively. Gelatinase activity was assessed by zymography. The migration ability was defined using wound-healing assay. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the cell cycle distribution. We also performed an in vivo experiment in a mouse model of prostate cancer to confirm the in vitro therapeutic effect of targeting the SP/NK1R system.  Results:   We found a noticeable increase in the expression of the truncated isoform of NK1R as an oncogenic NK1R splice variant in tumor cells. We also demonstrated that SP promotes both proliferative and migrative phenotypes of prostate cancer through modifying cell cycle-related proteins (c-Myc, cyclin D1, cyclin B1, p21), and apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2 and Bax), promoting cell migration and increasing MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity, while aprepitant administration could remarkably reverse these effects. SP also stimulated tumor growth in vivo, which was correlated with shorter survival times, while aprepitant reversed this effect and led to significantly longer survival time.  Significance:   Our findings suggest that SP/NK1R system may serve as a novel therapeutic target in prostate cancer and support the possible candidacy of aprepitant in future prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Safieh Ebrahimi', 'Farshad Mirzavi', 'Seyed Hamid Aghaee-Bakhtiari', 'Seyed Isaac Hashemy']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res""","""['Potential in vitro therapeutic effects of targeting SP/NK1R system in cervical cancer.', 'Hepatoblastoma cells express truncated neurokinin-1 receptor and can be growth inhibited by aprepitant in vitro and in vivo.', 'The Effect of Blocking Neurokinin-1 Receptor by Aprepitant on the Inflammatory and Apoptosis Pathways in Human Ovarian Cancer Cells.', 'New insight into the role of substance P/neurokinin-1 receptor system in breast cancer progression and its crosstalk with microRNAs.', 'The substance P/NK-1 receptor system: NK-1 receptor antagonists as anti-cancer drugs.', 'Neurokinin-1 receptor drives PKCɑ-AURKA/N-Myc signaling to facilitate the neuroendocrine progression of prostate cancer.', 'Functional neuronal circuits promote disease progression in cancer.', 'The In Vitro Pro-inflammatory Functions of the SP/NK1R System in Prostate Cancer: a Focus on Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) and Its Pro-inflammatory Target Genes.', 'The Potential In Vitro Inhibitory Effects of Neurokinin-1 Receptor (NK-1R) Antagonist, Aprepitant, in Osteosarcoma Cell Migration and Metastasis.', 'Involvement of the Substance P/Neurokinin-1 Receptor System in Cancer.']"""

Results:   The meeting and survey highlighted several developments since APAC APCCC 2018. Increased access and use in the region of PSMA PET/CT imaging is providing additional diagnostic and staging information for advanced prostate cancer and influencing local and systemic therapy choices. Awareness of oligometastatic disease, although not clearly defined, is increasing. Novel androgen receptor pathway antagonists are expanding treatment options. Cost and access to contemporary treatments and technologies continue to be a significant factor influencing therapeutic decisions in the region. With treatment options increasing, multidisciplinary treatment planning, shared decision making, and informed choice remain critical.

The production of 64 Cu is already well established. However, the production of 67 Cu in quantities suitable to conduct clinical trials is more challenging as it leads to the coproduction of other Cu isotopes, in particular 64 Cu. The aim of this study is to investigate the possibility of using a CuCl2 solution with a mixture of 67/64 Cu radioisotopes for therapeutic purposes, providing an alternative solution for the cyclotron production problem.  Methods:   Copper radioisotopes activities were calculated by considering proton beam irradiation of the following targets: (i) 70 Zn in the energy range 70-45 MeV; (ii) 68 Zn in the energy range 70-35 MeV; (iii) a combination of 70 Zn (70-55 MeV) and 68 Zn (55-35 MeV). The contribution of each copper radioisotope to the human-absorbed dose was estimated with OLINDA/EXM software using the biokinetic model for CuCl2 published by ICRP 53. The total absorbed dose generated by the 67/64 CuCl2 mixture, obtained through different production routes, was calculated at different times after the end of the bombardment (EOB). A simple spherical model was used to simulate tumors of different sizes containing uniformly distributed 67/64 Cu mixture and to calculate the absorbed dose of self-irradiation. The biological damage produced by 67 Cu and 64 Cu was also evaluated through cellular dosimetry and cell surviving fraction assessment using the MIRDcell code, considering two prostate cancer cell lines with different radiosensitivity.  Results:   The absorbed dose to healthy organs and the effective dose (ED) per unit of administered activity of 67 CuCl2 are higher than those of 64 CuCl2 . Absorbed dose values per unit of administered activity of 67/64 CuCl2 mixture increase with time after the EOB because the amount of 67 Cu in the mixture increases. Survival data showed that the biological damage caused per each decay of 67 Cu is greater than that of 64 Cu, assuming that radionuclides remain accumulated in the cell cytoplasm. Sphere model calculations demonstrated that 64 Cu administered activity must be about five times higher than that of 67 Cu to obtain the same absorbed dose for tumor mass between 0.01 and 10 g and about 10 times higher for very small spheres. Consequently, the 64 CuCl2 -absorbed dose to healthy organs will reach higher values than those of 67 CuCl2 . The supplemental activity of the 67/64 CuCl2 mixture, required to get the same tumor-absorbed dose produced by 67 CuCl2 , triggers a dose increment (DI) in healthy organs. The waiting time post-EOB necessary to keep this DI below 10% (t10% ) depends on the irradiation methods employed for the production of the 67/64 CuCl2 mixture.  Conclusions:   A mixture of cyclotron produced 67/64 Cu radioisotopes proved to be an alternative solution for the therapeutic use of CuCl2 with minimal DI to healthy organs compared with pure 67 Cu. Irradiation of a 70 Zn+68 Zn target in the 70-35 MeV proton energy range for 185 h appears to be the best option from among all the production routes investigated, as it gives the maximum amount of activity, the shortest t10% (10 h), and less than 1% of 61 Cu and 60 Cu impurities.""","""['Laura De Nardo', 'Gaia Pupillo', 'Liliana Mou', 'Juan Esposito', 'Antonio Rosato', 'Laura Meléndez-Alafort']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Internal radiation dose assessment of radiopharmaceuticals prepared with cyclotron-produced 99m Tc.', 'Alternative routes for 64Cu production using an 18\xa0MeV medical cyclotron in view of theranostic applications.', 'Cross-section measurement for an optimized 61Cu production at an 18 MeV medical cyclotron from natural Zn and enriched 64Zn solid targets.', 'An overview of copper radionuclides and production of 61Cu by proton irradiation of (nat)Zn at a medical cyclotron.', 'LARAMED: A Laboratory for Radioisotopes of Medical Interest.', 'First Results on Zinc Oxide Thick Film Deposition by Inverted Magnetron Sputtering for Cyclotron Solid Targets Production.', 'Estimation of biological effect of Cu-64 radiopharmaceuticals with Geant4-DNA simulation.', '67Cu Production Capabilities: A Mini Review.']"""

Nonetheless, a number of cancer patients are jamming traditional medicinal places seeking therapy. The results of these visits are undocumented. This study explored healthcare seeking behaviors and perspectives on cancer indigenous palliative care among patients visiting traditional health practitioners in Kenya.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study was undertaken through client exit survey. Face to face interviews were conducted using semi-structured questionnaires with all consenting cancer patients exiting mapped outlets. Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science Version 22.0.  Results:   A total of 433 respondents were interviewed and the majority were female 59.6%, Christians 97.2%, married 89.8% and educated 85.7%. Their mean age was 48.25 ± 15. 58. Education, sex and religion were significantly associated with perceived improvement. The predominant cancer types were breast cancer (22.4%); throat (14.8%), prostate (12.9%), bone (12.5%), cervical (9.9%), stomach (6.0%) and skin cancer (5.1%). The most frequently used traditional medicine was herbal medicine that was driven by unresponsive conditions (42.2%), inaccessible biomedical services (18.8%) and yearning for second opinion (18%) over a condition. Seventy six percent of the respondents reported improved and prolonged quality of life. 78.2% reported improved eating, drinking, standing, walking and doing light duties alone. Patients felt healthier, hopeful, happier, confident and bonded to their families.

The goal of this study was to determine expression patterns of ADH1 and ADH7 isozymes in normal, hyperplastic (benign prostatic hyperplasia [BPH]) and neoplastic (prostate cancer [PCa]) prostate. Furthermore, racial differences in ADH expression between African Americans and Caucasians were investigated.  Methods:   ADH expression patterns were characterized by density analysis of ADH immunohistochemistry (n = 21) and real-time RT-PCR of total RNAs by laser-capture microdissection (n = 10) and whole tissue formalin-fixed paraffin embedded prostate biopsies (n = 63).  Results:   ADH protein is found in normal prostate and is primarily associated with glandular epithelium. Transcripts of ADH1B are suppressed in PCa compared to BPH (p = 0.0095). Racial differences in ADH7 transcripts exist between African American and Caucasian men. A total of 57.6% of biopsies from African American prostates have detectable ADH7 messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts compared to the 13.3% of Caucasian prostate biopsies with detectable transcripts (p = 0.0005). This increased frequency of detection contributes to higher mean ADH7 mRNA transcript levels in African Americans (p = 0.001).  Conclusions:   To our knowledge this study is the first to report downregulation of ADH1B in neoplastic prostate at the transcriptional level, suggesting protective regulatory functions. ADH7 transcripts were not detectable in all samples and was found in higher frequency and amount in our African American samples. Racial differences in ADH7 within the prostate is a novel finding and should be investigated further.""","""['Sarah A Stamis', 'Elisabeth I Heath', 'Steven Lucas', 'Julie Boerner', 'Leslie B Slusher']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Expression of c-kit and kit-ligand in benign and malignant prostatic tissues.', 'Downregulated gelsolin expression in hyperplastic and neoplastic lesions of the prostate.', 'Benign prostatic hyperplasia: racial differences in treatment patterns and prostate cancer prevalence.', 'Pathology of premalignant lesions and carcinoma of the prostate in African-American men.', 'Enriching gene expression profiles will help personalize prostate cancer management for African-Americans: A perspective.', 'A Comparison of Tissue Dissection Techniques for Diagnostic, Prognostic, and Theragnostic Analysis of Human Disease.']"""

This study aims to explore the effects of ATG5 on prostate cancer metastasis and its molecular mechanism.  Methods:   The metastatic characteristics of LNCaP and DU145 cells were assessed by NOD/SCID mouse experiments, western blot, transwell assay, and wound-healing assay. Double membrane autophagic vesicle observation and the adenovirus-expressing mCherry-GFP-LC3B fusion protein were used to assess the autophagic characteristics of LNCaP and DU145 cells. The role of p62 in the accumulation of TWIST1 was confirmed by western blot under different conditions. The lentivirus particles of shATG5, NOD/SCID mice experiments, western blot, transwell assay, and wound-healing assay were used to confirm the role of ATG5 in TWIST1 accumulation and prostate cancer cell metastasis.  Results:   We identified a stabilizing effect of p62 on TWIST1 in the autophagic regulation of EMT and prostate cancer metastasis. The loss of ATG5 in DU145 cells resulted in autophagy deficiency and p62 accumulation, which stabilized TWIST1 and increased the TWIST1 level in prostate cancer cells, and eventually promoted EMT and metastasis. In comparison, LNCaP cells with regular ATG5 expression and autophagy status retained remarkable epithelial cell characteristics and had limited metastatic characteristics. Similar results were also found in wild-type LNCaP cells and LNCaP cells with stable ATG5 interference.

Although tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has broad-spectrum antitumor activity, its clinical applications are limited because most tumor cells eventually develop resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis through various pathways. Prostate apoptosis response-4 (Par-4) selectively induces apoptosis in cancer cells after binding to the cell surface receptor, GRP78. In this study, TRAIL was fused with the core domain of Par-4 (SAC) to produce a novel recombinant fusion protein. To obtain solubly expressed fusion protein, a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) was added to the N-terminus of the target protein. Cytotoxicity assays showed that the purified fusion protein exhibited more significant antitumor activity on cancer cells than that by native TRAIL. The connection order and linker sequence of the fusion proteins were optimized. In vitro cytotoxicity assay showed that the SAC-TRAIL fusion protein, which contained a flexible linker (G4S)3, optimally inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells. Immunofluorescence assays demonstrated that SAC-TRAIL could efficiently and specifically bind to cancer cells. Additionally, circular dichroism assays showed that the secondary structure of the recombinant protein with a flexible linker (G4S)3 has both a lower α-helix and higher random coiling, which facilitates the specific binding of SAC-TRAIL to the receptor. Collectively, these results suggest that the novel recombinant fusion protein SAC-(G4S)3-TRAIL is a potential therapeutic agent for cancer.

Consequently, sera from patients with prostate cancer, treated prior to or after vaccination in one of four separate clinical trials, were evaluated for antibody responses to an array of 177,604 peptides derived from over 1600 prostate cancer-associated gene products. Antibody responses to the same group of 5680 peptides previously reported were identified following vaccinations in which patients were administered GM-CSF as an adjuvant, but not with vaccine in the absence of GM-CSF. Hence, antibody responses to off-target proteins following vaccination may not necessarily serve as evidence of antigen spread and must be interpreted with particular caution following vaccine strategies that use GM-CSF, as GM-CSF appears to have direct effects on the production of antibodies.

Results:   In the high-interest group (n = 45), satisfaction correlated with high urinary function and urinary bother scores early after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (urinary function: 1 and 3 months, urinary bother: 3 months postoperatively; P < 0.05) and then with high sexual bother score thereafter (sexual bother at 6 and 12 months after surgery; P < 0.05). Sexual function score did not correlate with satisfaction. In the low-interest group (n = 56), satisfaction correlated with high urinary function and urinary bother scores over time (urinary function: 3 and 6 months, urinary bother: at 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively; P < 0.05). Neither sexual function nor sexual bother correlated with satisfaction postoperatively in the low-interest group.  Conclusions:   The impact of urinary and sexual functions and bothers on patients' overall satisfaction differed between patients with high- and low-interest in sex. The patient's interest in sex should be considered when assessing satisfaction after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.""","""['Yuki Kohada', 'Jun Ito', 'Yasuhiro Kaiho', 'Hiroki Kusumoto', 'Takashi Kukimoto', 'Jotaro Mikami', 'Nobuyuki Hinata', 'Makoto Sato']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment to Importance of considering interest in sex when evaluating satisfaction after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Quality of Life, Psychological Functioning, and Treatment Satisfaction of Men Who Have Undergone Penile Prosthesis Surgery Following Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of urinary and sexual patient-reported outcomes between open radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a propensity score matched, population-based study in Victoria.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Quality of life following radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy compared with open and laparoscopic approaches: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Long-term efficacy of penile rehabilitation with low-intensity extracorporeal shock wave therapy for sexual and erectile function recovery following robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a single-cohort pilot study.']"""

Using trained network-based image segmentation, we investigated if MRE data suffice to extract anatomical and viscoelastic information for automatic tabulation of zonal mechanical properties of the prostate. Overall, 40 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or prostate cancer (PCa) were examined with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences: T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and MRE-based tomoelastography, yielding six independent sets of imaging data per patient (T2w, DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient, MRE magnitude, shear wave speed, and loss angle maps). Combinations of these data were used to train Dense U-nets with manually segmented masks of the entire prostate gland (PG), central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ) in 30 patients and to validate them in 10 patients. Dice score (DS), sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff distance were determined. We found that segmentation based on MRE magnitude maps alone (DS, PG: 0.93 ± 0.04, CZ: 0.95 ± 0.03, PZ: 0.77 ± 0.05) was more accurate than magnitude maps combined with T2w and DWI_b (DS, PG: 0.91 ± 0.04, CZ: 0.91 ± 0.06, PZ: 0.63 ± 0.16) or T2w alone (DS, PG: 0.92 ± 0.03, CZ: 0.91 ± 0.04, PZ: 0.65 ± 0.08). Automatically tabulated MRE values were not different from ground-truth values (P>0.05). In conclusion, MRE combined with Dense U-net segmentation allows tabulation of quantitative imaging markers without manual analysis and independent of other MRI sequences and can thus contribute to PCa detection and classification.""","""['Nader Aldoj', 'Federico Biavati', 'Marc Dewey', 'Anja Hennemuth', 'Patrick Asbach', 'Ingolf Sack']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'In Vivo Quantification of Water Diffusion, Stiffness, and Tissue Fluidity in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia and Prostate Cancer.', 'MR elastography and diffusion-weighted imaging of ex vivo prostate cancer: quantitative comparison to histopathology.', 'Fully automated detection of prostate transition zone tumors on T2-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Net ensemble.', 'Segmentation of the prostate, its zones, anterior fibromuscular stroma, and urethra on the MRIs and multimodality image fusion using U-Net model.']"""

To address this, the Movember Global Action Plan 1 Unique tissue microarray (GAP1-UTMA) project constructed a set of unique and richly annotated tissue microarrays (TMA) from prostate cancer samples obtained from multiple institutions across several global locations.  Methods:   Three separate TMA sets were built that differ by purpose and disease state.  Results:   The intended use of TMA1 (Primary Matched LN) is to validate biomarkers that help determine which clinically localized prostate cancers with associated lymph node metastasis have a high risk of progression to lethal castration-resistant metastatic disease, and to compare molecular properties of high-risk index lesions within the prostate to regional lymph node metastases resected at the time of prostatectomy. TMA2 (Pre vs. Post ADT) was designed to address questions regarding risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and response to suppression of the androgen receptor/androgen axis, and characterization of the castration-resistant phenotype. TMA3 (CRPC Met Heterogeneity)'s intended use is to assess the heterogeneity of molecular markers across different anatomic sites in lethal prostate cancer metastases.  Conclusions:   The GAP1-UTMA project has succeeded in combining a large set of tissue specimens from 501 patients with prostate cancer with rich clinical annotation.

Methods:   Cancer incidence data were obtained from the population-based cancer registry of the Barretos Region, and mortality data were obtained from the Official Federal Database from 2002 to 2016. Age-standardized rates for incidence and mortality were calculated. Joinpoint Regression software was used to estimate the average annual percentage changes (AAPC).  Results:   Age-standardized rates of incidence increased significantly for colon cancer (AAPC: 2.2), rectum and rectosigmoid (AAPC: 2.4), liver (AAPC: 4.7), female breast (AAPC: 2.2), and thyroid cancer (AAPC: 3.8) but decreased for esophageal (AAPC: -3.2), stomach (AAPC: -4.2), lung (AAPC: -2.0), and ovarian cancer (AAPC: -5.6).

However, nongenomic drivers and downstream effectors of Wnt signaling in prostate cancer and the therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway in prostate cancer have not been fully established. Here we analyzed Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer and identified effectors distinct from those found in other tissues, including aryl hydrocarbon receptor and RUNX1, which are linked to stem cell maintenance, and ROR1, a noncanonical Wnt5a coreceptor. Wnt/β-catenin signaling-mediated increases in ROR1 enhanced noncanonical responses to Wnt5a. Regarding upstream drivers, APC genomic loss, but not its epigenetic downregulation commonly observed in prostate cancer, was strongly associated with Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation in clinical samples. Tumor cell upregulation of the Wnt transporter Wntless (WLS) was strongly associated with Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity in primary prostate cancer but also associated with both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling in mCRPC. IHC confirmed tumor cell WLS expression in primary prostate cancer and mCRPC, and patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts expressing WLS were responsive to treatment with Wnt synthesis inhibitor ETC-1922159. These findings reveal that Wnt/β-catenin signaling in prostate cancer drives stem cell maintenance and invasion and primes for noncanonical Wnt signaling through ROR1. They further show that autocrine Wnt production is a nongenomic driver of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling in prostate cancer, which can be targeted with Wnt synthesis inhibitors to suppress tumor growth.  Significance:   This work provides fundamental insights into Wnt signaling and prostate cancer cell biology and indicates that a subset of prostate cancer driven by autocrine Wnt signaling is sensitive to Wnt synthesis inhibitors.""","""['Fen Ma', 'Seiji Arai', 'Keshan Wang', 'Carla Calagua', 'Amanda R Yuan', 'Larysa Poluben', 'Zhongkai Gu', 'Joshua W Russo', 'David J Einstein', 'Huihui Ye', 'Meng Xiao He', 'Yu Liu', 'Eliezer Van Allen', 'Adam G Sowalsky', 'Manoj K Bhasin', 'Xin Yuan', 'Steven P Balk']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Activation of β-Catenin Cooperates with Loss of Pten to Drive AR-Independent Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling are simultaneously activated by Wnts in colon cancer cells.', 'The Wnt5a/Ror2 noncanonical signaling pathway inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in K562 cells.', 'Interplay Between SOX9, Wnt/β-Catenin and Androgen Receptor Signaling in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Insight into the role of Wnt5a-induced signaling in normal and cancer cells.', 'HOXB3 drives WNT-activation associated progression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Tumor cell plasticity in targeted therapy-induced resistance: mechanisms and new strategies.', 'The role of Evi/Wntless in exporting Wnt proteins.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer: WNT signaling, chromatin regulation, and transcriptional coregulators.', 'WNT5a Signaling through ROR2 Activates the Hippo Pathway to Suppress YAP1 Activity and Tumor Growth.']"""

Methods:   We used dogs with naturally occurring prostate cancer to study the molecular mechanism underlying Treg infiltration and the effect of anti-Treg treatment. Tumor-infiltrating Tregs was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and the association with prognosis was examined in dogs with spontaneous prostate cancer. The molecular mechanism of Treg infiltration was explored by RNA sequencing and protein analyses. A non-randomized canine clinical trial was conducted to define the therapeutic potential of anti-Treg treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Human prostate cancer datasets were analyzed to compare gene expression in dogs and humans.  Results:   Tumor-infiltrating Tregs were associated with poor prognosis in dogs bearing spontaneous prostate cancer. RNA sequencing and protein analyses showed a possible link between the CCL17-CCR4 pathway and the increase of tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Dogs with advanced prostate cancer responded to mogamulizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CCR4, with decreased circulating Tregs, improved survival, and low incidence of clinically relevant adverse events. Urinary CCL17 concentration and BRAFV595E mutation were independently predictive of the response to mogamulizumab. Analysis of a transcriptomic dataset of human prostate cancer showed that the CCL17-CCR4 axis correlated with Foxp3. In silico survival analyses revealed that high expression of CCL17 was associated with poor prognosis.

Aim:   To develop and psychometrically evaluate a new scale to measure sexual functioning among sexual minority men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Sexual minority prostate cancer patients (n = 401) completed an online battery of urinary and sexual functioning tests in 2019, including a new 37-item instrument about their sexual functioning post-treatment for prostate cancer.  Outcomes:   We used confirmatory factor analysis to determine the construct validity of a new scale including five subscales: a four-factor model for all participants (n = 401) evaluated Sexual Satisfaction, Sexual Confidence, Frequency of Sexual Problems, and Urinary Incontinence in Sex. A single-factor model completed only by participants who had attempted or desired receptive anal sex (n = 255) was evaluated in the fifth subscale: Problematic Receptive Anal Sex. To evaluate criterion validity, we calculated the intercorrelations between each Sexual Minorities and Prostate Cancer Scale (SMACS) subscale and four related scales: the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50 (EPIC), the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and the International Consultation on incontinence questionnaire. Cronbach's alphas were calculated to measure internal consistency (ie, reliability).  Results:   Cronbach's alpha values ranged from 0.64 to 0.89. Loadings (0.479-0.926) and model fit indices were strong (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: 0.085, Standardized root mean squared residual: 0.063, comparative fit index: 0.927, Tucker-Lewis Index: 0.907). For criterion validity, Sexual Satisfaction, Sexual Confidence, and Frequency of Sexual Problems were moderately correlated with EPIC function and bother scores (r = 0.50-0.72) and Urinary incontinence in sex correlated moderately with EPIC Urinary Function and International Consultation on incontinence questionnaire scores (0.45-0.56).  Clinical implications:   The SMACS can be used by clinicians and researchers to comprehensively measure sexual functioning in sexual minority men, in conjunction with existing scales.  Strengths and limitations:   This new scale is validated in a large, geographically diverse cohort of sexual minority cancer survivors and fills an important gap in existing measures of sexual functioning.

In clinical trials, COVID-19 vaccines were safe and efficacious against infection, hospitalization, and death, but most trials excluded participants with cancer. We report results from participants with a history of past or active neoplasm (malignant or benign/unknown) and up to 6 months' follow-up post-dose 2 from the placebo-controlled, observer-blinded trial of the 2-dose BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.  Patients and methods:   Between July 2020-January 2021, 46,429 participants aged ≥ 12 years were randomized at 152 sites in 6 countries. Healthy participants with pre-existing stable neoplasm could participate; those receiving immunosuppressive therapy were excluded. Data are reported for participants, aged ≥ 16 years for safety and ≥ 12 years for efficacy, who had any history of neoplasm at baseline (data cut-off: March 13, 2021). Adverse-event (AE) data are controlled for follow-up time before unblinding and reported as incidence rates (IRs) per 100 person-years follow-up.  Results:   At baseline, 3813 participants had a history of neoplasm; most common malignancies were breast (n = 460), prostate (n = 362), and melanoma (n = 223). Four BNT162b2 and 71 placebo recipients developed COVID-19 from 7 days post-dose 2; vaccine efficacy was 94.4% (95% CI: 85.2, 98.5) after up to 6 months' follow-up post-dose 2. This compares favorably with vaccine efficacy of 91.1% in the overall trial population after the same follow-up. AEs were reported at IRs of 95.4(BNT162b2) and 48.3 (placebo) per 100 person-years. Most common AEs were reactogenicity events (injection-site pain, fatigue, pyrexia). Three BNT162b2 and 1 placebo recipients withdrew because of vaccine-related AEs. No vaccine-related deaths were reported.  Conclusion:   In participants with past or active neoplasms, BNT162b2 vaccine has a similar efficacy and safety profile as in the overall trial population.

We evaluated the anti-tumour activity and safety of the PARP inhibitor niraparib in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancers and DRDs who progressed on previous treatment with an androgen signalling inhibitor and a taxane.  Methods:   In this multicentre, open-label, single-arm, phase 2 study, patients aged at least 18 years with histologically confirmed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mixed histology accepted, with the exception of the small cell pure phenotype) and DRDs (assessed in blood, tumour tissue, or saliva), with progression on a previous next-generation androgen signalling inhibitor and a taxane per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 or Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, were eligible. Enrolled patients received niraparib 300 mg orally once daily until treatment discontinuation, death, or study termination. For the final study analysis, all patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis population; patients with germline pathogenic or somatic biallelic pathogenic alterations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA cohort) or biallelic alterations in other prespecified DRDs (non-BRCA cohort) were included in the efficacy analysis population. The primary endpoint was objective response rate in patients with BRCA alterations and measurable disease (measurable BRCA cohort). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02854436.  Findings:   Between Sept 28, 2016, and June 26, 2020, 289 patients were enrolled, of whom 182 (63%) had received three or more systemic therapies for prostate cancer. 223 (77%) of 289 patients were included in the overall efficacy analysis population, which included BRCA (n=142) and non-BRCA (n=81) cohorts. At final analysis, with a median follow-up of 10·0 months (IQR 6·6-13·3), the objective response rate in the measurable BRCA cohort (n=76) was 34·2% (95% CI 23·7-46·0). In the safety analysis population, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events of any grade were nausea (169 [58%] of 289), anaemia (156 [54%]), and vomiting (111 [38%]); the most common grade 3 or worse events were haematological (anaemia in 95 [33%] of 289; thrombocytopenia in 47 [16%]; and neutropenia in 28 [10%]). Of 134 (46%) of 289 patients with at least one serious treatment-emergent adverse event, the most common were also haematological (thrombocytopenia in 17 [6%] and anaemia in 13 [4%]). Two adverse events with fatal outcome (one patient with urosepsis in the BRCA cohort and one patient with sepsis in the non-BRCA cohort) were deemed possibly related to niraparib treatment.

Methods:   This retrospective study included men who contributed data to the Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry-Victoria (PCOR-Vic), underwent ORP or RARP between January 2014 and May 2018, and completed the EPIC-26 questionnaire 12 months post-surgery. Urinary and sexual bother items, the urinary incontinence domain score, the urinary irritative/obstructive domain score, the sexual domain score and the pad usage item from the EPIC-26 questionnaire were compared between the two cohorts. Unmatched and propensity score matched cohorts were used to determine if there were differences in urinary and sexual PROs between ORP and RARP after accounting for the patient case-mix and surgeon characteristics.  Results:   Of 3826 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP), 1047 received ORP and 2779 received RARP. Propensity score matching reduced the magnitude of the observed differences in four out of six outcomes (urinary bother, urinary incontinence domain, pad usage and sexual domain). Using a propensity score matched cohort, there were no statistically significant differences for RARP patients, compared to ORP patients, in terms of urinary bother (Rd = 0.47%, P = 0.707), urinary incontinence domain scores (Coeff = - 0.84, P = 0.506), urinary irritative/obstructive domain scores (Coeff = 1.03, P = 0.105), pad usage (Rd = - 0.75%, P = 0.771) and sexual bother (Rd = - 0.89%, P = 0.731). RARP patients had slightly higher sexual domain scores (Coeff = 3.65, P = 0.005).  Conclusion:   There were no differences in urinary PROs between ORP and RARP when assessed 12 months post-surgery.

However, most patients eventually develop resistance to chemotherapy and experience tumor progression or even death. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) affect docetaxel chemosensitivity. However, the biological role and regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer remain unclear. Differences in lncRNAs were evaluated by lncRNA sequencing and evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and TrkB expression was measured through western blot analysis. Proliferation was measured using the MTS, while apoptosis and cell cycle were measured using flow cytometry. In addition, migration and invasion were measured using transwell assays. Forty-eight female BALB/c nude mice were used for subcutaneous tumorigenicity and lung metastasis assays. We found that LINC01963 was overexpressed in the PC3-DR cells. LINC01963 silencing enhanced the chemosensitivity of PC3-DR to docetaxel and inhibited tumorigenicity and lung metastasis, while LINC01963 overexpression enhanced the chemoresistance of PC3 cells to docetaxel. It was found that LINC01963 bind to miR-216b-5p. The miR-216b-5p inhibitor reversed the suppressive effect of sh-LINC01963 on PC3-DR cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, miR-216b-5p can bind to the 3'-UTR of NTRK2 and inhibit TrkB protein levels. TrkB enhances docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer and reverses the effects of LINC01963 silencing and miR-216b-5p overexpression. In conclusion, silencing LINC01963 inhibited TrkB protein level to enhance the chemosensitivity of PC3-DR to docetaxel by means of competitively binding to miR-216b-5p.

It is not yet known whether men with advanced prostate cancer can elicit such adaptations following a program of exercise. The purpose is to examine myokine levels of serum acquired from metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients recruited to the INTERVAL-GAP4 trial before and after 6 months of exercise and its tumour-suppressive effect.  Methods:   Twenty-five men with mCRPC (age = 74.7 ± 7.1 yrs) were randomised to supervised multimodal (aerobic and resistance) exercise (EX) or self-directed exercise control group (CON). Body composition was assessed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and fasting blood in a rested state was collected at baseline and at 6 months. Serum levels of myokines (SPARC, OSM, decorin, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3) were measured. Serum was applied to the prostate cancer cell line DU145, and growth was assessed for 72 h.  Results:   No significant change in body composition was observed. Adjusted serum OSM (P = 0.050) and relative OSM (P = 0.083), serum SPARC (P = 0.022) and relative SPARC (P = 0.025) increased in EX compared to CON. The area under curve (AUC) over 72 h showed a significant reduction in DU145 growth after applying post-intervention serum from the EX vs CON (P = 0.029).

We evaluated whether including additional SNPs in a prostate cancer polygenic hazard score (PHS) would improve associations with clinically significant prostate cancer in multi-ancestry datasets.  Methods:   In total, 299 SNPs previously associated with prostate cancer were evaluated for inclusion in a new PHS, using a LASSO-regularized Cox proportional hazards model in a training dataset of 72,181 men from the PRACTICAL Consortium. The PHS model was evaluated in four testing datasets: African ancestry, Asian ancestry, and two of European Ancestry-the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM) and the ProtecT study. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to compare men with high versus low PHS for association with clinically significant, with any, and with fatal prostate cancer. The impact of genetic risk stratification on the positive predictive value (PPV) of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer was also measured.  Results:   The final model (PHS290) had 290 SNPs with non-zero coefficients. Comparing, for example, the highest and lowest quintiles of PHS290, the hazard ratios (HRs) for clinically significant prostate cancer were 13.73 [95% CI: 12.43-15.16] in ProtecT, 7.07 [6.58-7.60] in African ancestry, 10.31 [9.58-11.11] in Asian ancestry, and 11.18 [10.34-12.09] in COSM. Similar results were seen for association with any and fatal prostate cancer. Without PHS stratification, the PPV of PSA testing for clinically significant prostate cancer in ProtecT was 0.12 (0.11-0.14). For the top 20% and top 5% of PHS290, the PPV of PSA testing was 0.19 (0.15-0.22) and 0.26 (0.19-0.33), respectively.

Whether Bic also damages the glycolytic pathway has never been cited. To investigate this, we performed an in vitro model study with mesangial cells, and at the same time, collected data from an in vivo experiment. Bic induced hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 which upregulates phosphorylated-5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) and severely suppresses the rate of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in both the oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis pathways. Bic suppressed the oxygen consumption rate, extracellular acidification rate, and mitochondrial proton efflux rate, downregulated in vivo but upregulated in vitro glucose transporter (GLUT)-1, reduced glucose uptake, inhibited key glycolytic enzymes, including phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), and upregulated hexokinase II (HKII) and lactic dehydrogenase A (LDHA). In vivo, Bic downregulated renal cubilin levels, thereby disrupting the glomerular reabsorption function. Conclusively, Bic can damage bioenergenesis from both mitochondria and glycolysis. It was suggested that long-term administration of Bic can initiate renal damage depending on the duration and dose of treatment, which requires cautious follow-up.""","""['Chiung-Chi Peng', 'Chang-Rong Chen', 'Chang-Yu Chen', 'Kuan-Chou Chen', 'Robert Y Peng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Chem Biol Interact""","""['Bicalutamide Elicits Renal Damage by Causing Mitochondrial Dysfunction via ROS Damage and Upregulation of HIF-1.', 'Renal Damaging Effect Elicited by Bicalutamide Therapy Uncovered Multiple Action Mechanisms As Evidenced by the Cell Model.', 'The androgen receptor pathway is by-passed in prostate cancer cells generated after prolonged treatment with bicalutamide.', 'HIF-1alpha modulates energy metabolism in cancer cells by inducing over-expression of specific glycolytic isoforms.', 'Bicalutamide dosages used in the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

However, approximately 70% of PCa patients undergoing a radical prostatectomy are IDC/C negative, yet up-to 20% of these patients progress and experience BCR. Thus, tumor histopathologic characteristics such as IDC/C alone are limited in their ability to predict disease progression. Conversely, several nomograms such as Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment-Surgery (CAPRA-S) have been developed to aid in the prognostication of BCR, but not yet widely applied in clinical settings.  Materials and methods:   In this study, we assessed the combined prognostic utility of IDC/C, and CAPRA-S for BCR in 3 PCa patient cohorts.  Results:   CAPRA-S+IDC/C improved the predictive accuracy of BCR in all 3 cohorts (P < .001). Specifically, among IDC/C negative cases, CAPRA-S improved the prognostication of BCR in low-risk (Cohort 1; P < .001, Cohort 2; P < .001, Cohort 3; P = .003), intermediate (Cohort 1; P < .001, Cohort 2; P = .006, Cohort 3; P = .03) and high-risk (Cohort 1-3; P < .001) patients. Conversely, IDC/C improved the prognostication of BCR among CAPRA-S low-risk (Cohorts 1; P < .001 and Cohort 3; P = .003) patients.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest the investigation of histopathological IDC/C features in CAPRA-S low-risk patients and conversely, nomogram CAPRA-S among IDC/C negative patients improves the identification of patients likely to experience BCR, which would otherwise be missed through current assessment regimens. These patients can be offered more intensive monitoring and adjuvant therapies upfront to circumvent the development of recurrent cancer or overtreatment at the time of surgery.""","""['Renu Jeyapala', 'Shivani Kamdar', 'Ekaterina Olkhov-Mitsel', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Tapio Visakorpi', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Bharati Bapat']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Impact of cribriform pattern 4 and intraductal prostatic carcinoma on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and Cancer of Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) patient stratification.', 'GBX2 Methylation Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Improves Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Among Patients with Prostate Cancer Negative for Intraductal Carcinoma and Cribriform Architecture.', 'Evaluation of biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy by cancer of the prostate risk assessment post-surgical (CAPRA-S) score.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate without High-Grade Invasive Adenocarcinoma: Report of Two Cases and Review of the Literature.']"""

We sought to assess whether VAs, compared to key figures (KFs), increased reader engagement via social media using articles published in European Urology. We prospectively randomized 200 consecutive new publications to representation on Twitter and Instagram using either a VA (n = 99) or a KF (n = 101). Randomization was stratified by prostate cancer content. The primary outcome was Twitter impressions. Secondary outcomes included Twitter total engagements, link clicks, likes, and retweets, as well as Instagram likes. Analysis of covariance was conducted using the stratification variable as a covariate. We found that Twitter impressions were greater for tweets containing VAs compared to KFs (8385 vs 6882; adjusted difference 1480, 95% confidence interval [CI] 434-2526; p = 0.006). VA use was also associated with more retweets and likes (p < 0.002), but fewer full-article link clicks than KFs (60 vs 105, adjusted difference 45, 95% CI 21-70; p = 0.0004). The choice between VA and KF should depend on the relative value given to impressions versus full-article link clicks. PATIENT SUMMARY: We found that use of a visual abstract increases the social media reach of new urology articles when compared to key figures from the manuscript, but was associated in a significantly lower click-through rate. In the increasingly virtual world of academic medicine, these findings may assist authors, editors, and publishers with dissemination of new research.""","""['Zachary Klaassen', 'Emily Vertosick', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Melissa J Assel', 'Giacomo Novara', 'Cathy Pierce', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'James W F Catto', 'Alexander Kutikov']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Re: Zachary Klaassen, Emily Vertosick, Andrew J.

However, few eukaryotic genetic instability endpoints have been directly measured for CYP1B1-activated metabolites. In this study, we expressed human CYP1B1 in yeast strains that measure DNA damage-associated toxicity and frequencies of chromosomal translocations. DNA damage-associated toxicity was measured in a rad4 rad51 strain, defective in both DNA excision and recombinational repair. Frequencies of chromosomal translocations were measured in diploid yeast strains containing two his3 fragments. These strains were exposed to benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol (BaP-DHD), aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), and the heterocyclic aromatic amines, 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ). We observed that AFB1, BaP-DHD, IQ, and MeIQx conferred toxicity in the DNA repair mutant expressing CYP1B1. Translocation frequencies increased eight-fold and three-fold after exposure to 50 μM AFB1 and 33 μM BaP-DHD respectively. A DNA damage response was observed after AFB1 exposure, as measured by the induction of the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, Rnr3. While CYP1B1-mediated activation of BaP-DHD and heterocyclic aromatic amines was expected, activation of AFB1 to become a potent recombinagen was not expected.

We aimed to evaluate the association of genetically proxied inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) with risks of breast cancer and prostate cancer using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method.  Methods:   Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 associated with LDL-C in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium (GLGC; up to 188,577 European individuals) were used to proxy inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, NPC1L1, and PCSK9. Summary statistics with outcomes were obtained from a GWAS meta-analysis of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC; 228,951 European females) and a Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL; 140,254 European males) consortium. SNPs were combined into multiallelic models and MR estimates representing lifelong inhibition of targets were generated using the inverse-variance weighted method.  Results:   Genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (OR: 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.95; P = 0.005) and NPC1L1 (OR: 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.90; P = 0.005) equivalent to a 1-mmol/L (38.7 mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C was associated with reduced breast cancer risk. There were no significant associations of genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 with breast cancer. In contrast, genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 (OR: 0.81; 95% CI 0.73-0.90; P < 0.001) but not HMG-CoA reductase and NPC1L1 was negatively associated with prostate cancer. In the secondary analysis, genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (OR: 0.82; 95% CI 0.71-0.95; P = 0.008) and NPC1L1 (OR: 0.66; 95% CI 0.50-0.86; P = 0.002) was associated with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, whereas there was no association of HMG-CoA reductase and NPC1L1 with estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.  Conclusions:   Genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and NPC1L1 was significantly associated with lower odds of breast cancer, while genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 was associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer.

We assessed whether the Oncology Care Model (OCM), an alternative payment model for practices providing chemotherapy to patients with cancer, affected the overall use and value of radiation therapy in terms of Choosing Wisely recommendations.  Methods and materials:   We used Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrative data to identify beneficiaries enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare who initiated chemotherapy episodes at OCM and propensity-matched comparison practices. Difference-in-difference (DID) analyses evaluated the effect of OCM on overall use of postoperative radiation for breast cancer, use of intensity modulated radiation therapy and hypofractionation for breast cancer, and fractionation patterns for treatment of metastatic bone disease from breast or prostate cancer. We performed additional analyses stratified by the presence or absence of a radiation oncologist in the practice.  Results:   Among 27,859 postoperative breast cancer episodes, OCM had no effect on overall use of radiation therapy after breast surgery (DID percentage point difference = 0.4%; 90% confidence interval [CI], -1.7%, 2.4%) or on use of intensity modulated radiation therapy in this setting (DID = -0.6; 90% CI, -3.1, 2.0). Among 19,366 metastatic bone disease episodes, OCM had no effect on fractionation patterns for palliation of bone metastases (DID for ≤10 fractions = -1.1%; 90% CI, -2.6%, 0.4% and DID for single fraction = -0.2%; 90% CI, -1.9%, 1.6%). Results were similar for practices with and without a radiation oncologist. We did not evaluate the effect of OCM on hypofractionated radiation after breast-conserving surgery owing to evidence of differential baseline trends.

This challenge is even more acute for Middle Eastern populations, where the paucity of genomic data could affect the clinical potential of cancer genetic risk profiling. We used data from the phase 1 cohort of the Qatar Genome Programme to investigate genetic variation in cancer-susceptibility genes in the Qatari population.  Methods:   The Qatar Genome Programme generated high-coverage genome sequencing on DNA samples collected from 6142 native Qataris, stratified into six distinct ancestry groups: general Arab, Persian, Arabian Peninsula, Admixture Arab, African, and South Asian. In this population-based, cohort study, we evaluated the performance of polygenic risk scores for the most common cancers in Qatar (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers). Polygenic risk scores were trained in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset, and their distributions were subsequently applied to the six different genetic ancestry groups of the Qatari population. Rare deleterious variants within 1218 cancer susceptibility genes were analysed, and their clinical pathogenicity was assessed by ClinVar and the CharGer computational tools.  Findings:   The cohort included in this study was recruited by the Qatar Biobank between Dec 11, 2012, and June 9, 2016. The initial dataset comprised 6218 cohort participants, and whole genome sequencing quality control filtering led to a final dataset of 6142 samples. Polygenic risk score analyses of the most common cancers in Qatar showed significant differences between the six ancestry groups (p<0·0001). Qataris with Arabian Peninsula ancestry showed the lowest polygenic risk score mean for colorectal cancer (-0·41), and those of African ancestry showed the highest average for prostate cancer (0·85). Cancer-gene rare variant analysis identified 76 Qataris (1·2% of 6142 individuals in the Qatar Genome Programme cohort) carrying ClinVar pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in clinically actionable cancer genes. Variant analysis using CharGer identified 195 individuals carriers (3·17% of the cohort). Breast cancer pathogenic variants were over-represented in Qataris of Persian origin (22 [56·4%] of 39 BRCA1/BRCA2 variant carriers) and completely absent in those of Arabian Peninsula origin.

Forty-five patients who underwent PI using iodine-125 seeds combined with endocrine therapy or androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were compared with 151 patients who underwent RP combined with endocrine therapy or adjuvant ADT. The efficacy and safety outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and t-tests. Results Between the RP and PI treatment modalities, no significant difference (P > 0.05) in biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) was observed using Kaplan-Meier curves, regardless of the combination of adjuvant treatment modalities. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed (P > 0.05) with respect to PSA fluctuations, albumin, leukocyte count, urinary and rectal symptoms, erectile function or quality of life (QoL) between the two therapy methods. However, significant differences in the maximum flow rate, average length of hospital stay and indwelling catheter time were observed between the two groups (P < 0.001).

When marital status and race were combined, single black patients had the worst prognosis after adjusting for other variables (hazard ratio = 1.93, 95% confidence interval: 1.58-2.35; p < 0.001). Married status had a prognostic advantage in all races. In the same marital groups, whites and Asians had lower risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality than blacks with married and single status (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Marital status and race serve as prognostic factors for localized prostate cancer. Blacks or single individuals had higher risk of mortality when considered independently, and single black patients had the worst prognosis. Furthermore, married status was an advantage in the same race group, and whites and Asians had lower risk than blacks with married and single status. Accordingly, the interaction between race and marital status on prostate cancer prognosis in clinical practice should be assessed carefully.""","""['Sijun Liu', 'Zongwei Wang', 'Xingbo Long', 'Aaron Fleishman', 'Xiangchun Huang', 'Qingguang Wu', 'Boris Gershman', 'Aria F Olumi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['The long-running disparity in early detection and treatment of prostate cancer in African American men.', 'Impact of marital status and race on outcomes of patients enrolled in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group prostate cancer trials.', 'Prognosis of prostate cancer and bone metastasis pattern of patients: a SEER-based study and a local hospital based study from China.', 'Marital status and colon cancer outcomes in US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries: does marriage affect cancer survival by gender and stage?', 'Marital status and prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Marital status independently predicts testis cancer survival--an analysis of the SEER database.', 'American Indian/Alaska Native men are less likely to receive prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal exams from primary care providers than White men: a secondary analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012-2018.']"""

Materials and methods:   Included were patients ≤ 55 years treated with PB. Erectile function at baseline and after treatment were assessed using the physician-reported CTCAE version 4.0. Biochemical failure (BF) was defined according to the Phoenix Consensus definition (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL). The log-rank test (Kaplan-Meier method) and cox-regression analysis was used to calculate BF-free survival.  Results:   Between July 2005 and November 2020, a total of 137 patients ≤ 55 years (range 44-55 years old) were treated with PB. Median follow up was 72 months. Twenty percent had Gleason 3+4 disease and 6% a PSA >10 ng/mL. Median prostate volume was 34 cc. Actuarial biochemical failure free survival at 5, 7, and 10 years, were 98%, 95% and 89%, respectively. Five patients received local salvage treatment. On multivariate analysis, CAPRA-score (HR 4.46, 95%CI 1.76-11.33, p = 0.002) and the dosimetric measure D90 > 130 Gy (p = 0.03) were predictive of BF. Five deaths occurred in our cohort, two due to cardiovascular reasons and three due to another malignancy. At baseline, all patients were able to have erections with or without medication. At 5 years and 7 years after PB, 80% and 64% of patients had little or no ED (erections without the need for medication) respectively.  Conclusion:   In young-onset patients treated with PB, failure rates are similar to their older counterparts.

This is important as such patients may benefit from postoperative radiotherapy. With the advent of preoperative MRI, we posited that pelvimetry could predict positive margins after RP in patients with less-than ideal pelvic dimensions undergoing robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery.  Materials and methods:   After IRB approval, data from patients undergoing RP at our center between 1/1/2018 and 12/31/2019 (n = 314) who had undergone prior prostate MRI imaging (n = 102) were analyzed. All RPs were performed using robotic-assisted laparoscopic technique. Data from the cancer center data warehouse were retrieved, to include postoperative T-stage, gland size, responsible surgeon, PSA, patient body mass index, and surgical margin status. These data were analyzed with corresponding pelvimetry data from 91 preoperative scans with complete data and imaging.  Results:   On multivariable analysis, pathologic T-stage (p = 0.004), anteroposterior pelvic outlet (p = 0.015) and pelvic depth (length of the pubic symphysis; p = 0.019) were all statistically correlated with positive surgical margins.  Conclusions:   With the widespread use of MRI in the initial staging of prostate cancer, automated radiomic analysis could augment the critical data already being accumulated in terms of seminal vesical involvement, extracapsular extension, and suspicious lymph nodes as risk factors for postoperative salvage radiation.

The objective of this study is to simultaneously assess these two types of germline mutations.  Methods:   Germline rare pathogenic mutations (RPMs) in 9 commonly tested DNA repair genes and KLK3 variants were tested for their associations with PCa progression in two PCa cohorts: (1) hospital-based PCa patients treated with radical surgery at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH, N = 1943), and (2) population-based PCa patients in the UK Biobank (UKB, N = 10,224). Progression was defined as metastasis and/or PCa-specific death (JHH) and PCa-specific death (UKB). RPMs of DNA repair genes were annotated using the American College of Medical Genetics recommendations. Known KLK3 variants were genotyped. Associations were tested using a logistic regression model adjusting for genetic background (top ten principal components).  Results:   In the JHH, 3.2% (59/1,843) of patients had RPMs in 9 DNA repair genes; odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence interval) for progression was 2.99 (1.6-5.34), P < 0.001. In comparison, KLK3 I179T mutation was more common; 9.7% (189/1,943) carried the mutation, OR = 1.6 (1.05-2.37), P = 0.02. Similar results were found in the UKB. Both types of mutations remained statistically significant in multivariable analyses. In the combined cohort, compared to patients without any mutations (RPMs-/KLK3-), RPMs-/KLK3+ patients had modestly increased risk for progression [OR = 1.54 (1.15-2.02), P = 0.003], and RPMs+/KLK3+ patients had greatly increased risk for progression [OR = 5.41 (2.04-12.99), P < 0.001]. Importantly, associations of mutations with PCa progression were found in patients with clinically defined low- or intermediate risk for disease progression.  Conclusions:   Two different cohorts consistently demonstrate that KLK3 I179T and RPMs of nine commonly tested DNA repair genes are complementary for predicting PCa progression.

Given the responsiveness to selective NTRK inhibitors, it remains critical to identify those ultra-rare cases occurring in the viscera of adults. In five females and two males aged 18-53 years, we characterized visceral mesenchymal tumors harboring TPM3-NTRK1 [uterine cervix (N = 2), pleura, prostate], LMNA-NTRK1 (lung), SQSTM1-NTRK3 (heart), and NTRK3 rearrangement with unknown fusion partner (colon/mesocolon) with RNA sequencing, FISH, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry. The tumors exhibited spindled to ovoid/epithelioid or pleomorphic cells, often arranged in fascicles, and were low-to-intermediate-grade and high-grade in three and four cases, respectively. Keloid-like stromal collagen and perivascular hyalinization was noted in five. Adenosarcoma-like appearances were observed in two, manifesting frond-like protrusions in one cervical tumor and phyllodes-like architecture in the prostatic tumor. Abrupt high-grade transformation into pleomorphic liposarcoma was found in another cervical tumor, while the pleural tumor contained intermixed rhabdomyoblasts. Pan-TRK immunostaining was positive in all cases. All cases expressed CD34, while five were S100-positive. CDKN2A homozygous deletion with concomitant p16 loss occurred in 4/7. Whole-exome sequencing identified TP53 mutation (c.672+2T>C, involving a splice site, with concomitant protein loss) in a cervical sarcoma, limited to its heterologous liposarcomatous component. At least moderate pan-TRK immunoreactivity was present in varying proportions of potential pathologic mimics, with BCOR-positive sarcoma (56%, 5/9), undifferentiated uterine sarcoma (50%, 3/6), and spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (33%, 2/6) being among the most frequent. This underscored the unsatisfactory specificity of pan-TRK immunohistochemistry and warranted molecular confirmation in the diagnosis of adult NTRK-rearranged visceral mesenchymal neoplasms.

The study included 390 nonaggressive (T1-2, N0, M0, and Gleason score <8) and 313 aggressive cases (T3-4, or N1, or M1, or Gleason score 8-10) diagnosed after blood draw (1998-2001) and up to 2013, and a random subcohort of 1,303 cancer-free men at blood draw in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort. Prentice-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   In the multivariable-adjusted model without body mass index, HbA1c was inversely associated with nonaggressive prostate cancer (HR per unit increase, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80-1.00; P = 0.04).

Intraoperative molecular imaging (IMI) with tumor-targeted optical contrast agents is effective in improving resection completeness for other tumor types, but there are no IMI tracers targeted to pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. In this report, we describe the use of a novel prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted near-infrared conjugate (OTL78) to identify pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma. We identified PSMA as a viable target by examining its expression in human lung tumor specimens from a surgical cohort. Ninety-four percent of tumors expressed PSMA in either the pulmonary squamous cells or the tumor neovasculature. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we found that OTL78 reliably localized pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma in a PSMA-dependent manner.

Although the photoelectrochemical (PEC)-based POCT platform offers the benefits of cheap cost and good user engagement, its commercialization is still limited by the photodetection components' downsizing and mobility, among other factors. In this work, a novel highly integrated PEC biosensor aided by piezophototronics to enhance the efficiency of PEC testing was reported for flexible detection of cancer-associated antigens in biological fluids (prostate-specific antigen, PSA, used as an example). Multiple signal enhancement strategies, including a magnetic bead-linked enzyme-linked immune system catalyzing the production of ascorbic acid from the substrate and a piezoelectric-assisted enhancement strategy, were used for sensitive detection of the analyte to be tested in human body fluids. Unlike the electron transfer mechanism in heterojunctions, piezoelectric semiconductors promote the transfer of electrons and holes by generating piezoelectric potentials in the ultrasonic field, thus contributing to the performance of the PEC testbed. Under optimized conditions, the test platform achieves good correspondence for PSA at 0.02-40 ng mL-1. Impressively, the test devices are comparable to or even superior to gold standard ELISA kits in terms of cost approval and batch testing.

The treatment planning process requires accurate and precise segmentation of the prostate and organs at risk (OARs), which is laborious and time-consuming when contoured manually. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based auto-segmentation has the potential to significantly accelerate the radiation therapy treatment planning process; however, the accuracy of auto-segmentation needs to be validated before its full clinical adoption.  Purpose:   A commercial AI-based contouring model was trained to provide segmentation of the prostate and surrounding OARs. The segmented structures were input to a commercial auto-planning module for automated prostate treatment planning. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of this contouring model in the automated prostate treatment planning process.  Methods and materials:   A 3D U-Net-based model (INTContour, Carina AI) was trained and validated on 84 computed tomography (CT) scans and tested on an additional 23 CT scans from patients treated in our local institution. Prostate and OARs contours generated by the AI model (AI contour) were geometrically evaluated against reference contours. The prostate contours were further evaluated against AI, reference, and two additional observer contours for comparison using inter-observer variation (IOV) and 3D boundaries discrepancy analyses. A blinded evaluation was introduced to assess subjectively the clinical acceptability of the AI contours. Finally, treatment plans were created from an automated prostate planning workflow using the AI contours and were evaluated for their clinical acceptability following the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group-0815 protocol.  Results:   The AI contours demonstrated good geometric accuracy on OARs and prostate contours, with average Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) for bladder, rectum, femoral heads, seminal vesicles, and penile bulb of 0.93, 0.85, 0.96, 0.72, and 0.53, respectively. The DSC, 95% directed Hausdorff distance (HD95), and mean surface distance for the prostate were 0.83 ± 0.05, 6.07 ± 1.87 mm, and 2.07 ± 0.73 mm, respectively. No significant differences were found when comparing with IOV. In the double-blinded evaluation, 95.7% of the AI contours were scored as either ""perfect"" (34.8%) or ""acceptable"" (60.9%), while only one case (4.3%) was scored as ""unacceptable with minor changes required."" In total, 69.6% of the AI contours were considered equal to or better than the reference contours by an independent radiation oncologist. Automated treatment plans created from the AI contours produced similar and clinically acceptable dosimetric distributions as those from plans created from reference contours.  Conclusions:   The investigated AI-based commercial model for prostate segmentation demonstrated good performance in clinical practice.

Overexpression of CD49b has been associated with unfavorable survival rates in several malignant tumor entities, such as prostate cancer, gastric cancer and colon cancer. Therefore, we aimed to analyze the protein expression of CD49b in patients with different types of lung cancer and additionally to identify the influence of CD49b on clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival.Expression levels of CD49b were retrospective analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 92 cases of pulmonary adenocarcinoma (AC), 85 cases of squamous cell lung carcinoma (SQCLC) and 32 cases of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and correlated with clinicopathological characteristics and patients' overall survival.A strong expression of CD49b was most seen in SQCLC (78%), followed by AC (48%) and SCLC (9%). All patients combined, strong expression of CD49b correlated significantly with poorer overall survival. However, an increased expression of CD49b correlated significantly with a poorer survival rate only in SQCLC. In AC and SCLC, no significant correlation could be demonstrated in this regard.In our study, CD49b expression was associated with poor overall survival in patients with SQCLC.

For detecting progression timely, patients undergo invasive tests planned in a fixed one-size-fits-all manner (eg, annually). We aim to present personalized test schedules based on the risk of disease progression, that optimize the burden (the number of tests) and the benefit (shorter time delay in detecting progression is better) better than fixed schedules, and enable shared decision making. Our motivation comes from the problem of scheduling biopsies in prostate cancer surveillance. Using joint models for time-to-event and longitudinal data, we consolidate patients' longitudinal data (eg, biomarkers) and results of previous tests, into individualized future cumulative-risk of progression. We then create personalized schedules by planning tests on future visits where the predicted cumulative-risk is above a threshold (eg, 5% risk). We update personalized schedules with data gathered over follow-up. To find the optimal risk threshold, we minimize a utility function of the expected number of tests (burden) and expected time delay in detecting progression (shorter is beneficial) for different thresholds. We estimate these two in a patient-specific manner for following any schedule, by utilizing a patient's predicted risk profile.

Given the requirement to develop immune-mediated antitumor activity as vaccine-based therapy, sipuleucel-T may have delayed clinical activity. We explored this in a cohort of men from PROCEED (NCT01306890), an FDA-requested outcomes registry, and in a separate institutional cohort of mCRPC patients treated with sipuleucel-T at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI).  Methods:   Men with mCRPC who received 3 infusions of sipuleucel-T and did not initiate a new mCRPC directed therapy for ≥6 months after completion of sipuleucel-T were included. All patients had rising PSA before starting sipuleucel-T and available post-treatment PSA measurements. Clinical outcomes of interest included: PSA50 response rate, time to subsequent mCRPC directed therapy, and overall survival (OS).

We conducted an initial training phase using the tissue microarray based Canary retrospective radical prostatectomy cohort. Of 1287 patients analyzed, cribriform growth was observed in 307 (24%). Using Kaplan-Meier estimates of recurrence-free survival curves (RFS) that were stratified by cribriform gland size, we identified 0.25 mm as the optimal cutoff to identify more aggressive disease. In univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, size >0.25 mm was a significant predictor of worse RFS compared to patients with cribriform glands ≤0.25 mm, independent of pre-operative PSA, grade, stage and margin status (p < 0.001). In addition, two different subset analyses of low-intermediate risk cases (cases with Gleason score ≤ 3 + 4 = 7; and cases with Gleason score = 3 + 4 = 7/4 + 3 = 7) likewise demonstrated patients with largest cribriform diameter >0.25 mm had a significantly lower RFS relative to patients with cribriform glands ≤0.25 mm (each subset p = 0.004). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in outcomes between patients with cribriform glands ≤ 0.25 mm and patients without cribriform glands.

Tocotrienols may have higher potential for clinical use due to their lower effective doses in laboratory studies. However, most studies on tocotrienols have been carried out using cancer cell lines. Strong data from animal studies may encourage the use of tocotrienols for human cancer prevention research. To examine the cancer inhibitory activity of different vitamin E forms, we first investigated their inhibitory activities of different vitamin E forms in prostate cancer cell lines. We found that δ-tocotrienol (δT3) was the most effective form in inhibiting cell growth at equivalent doses. Because of this in vitro potency, δT3 was further studied using prostate-specific Pten-/- (Ptenp-/-) mice. We found that 0.05% δT3 in diet reduced prostate adenocarcinoma multiplicity by 32.7%, featuring increased apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. The inhibitory effect of 0.05% δT3 in diet was similar to that of 0.2% δ-tocopherol (δT) in diet reported previously. Our further study on the δT3-induced transcriptome changes indicated that δT3 inhibited genes in blood vessel development in the prostate of Ptenp-/- mice, which was confirmed by IHC. Together, our results demonstrate that δT3 effectively inhibits the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in Ptenp-/- mice, which involves inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis and promotion of apoptosis.  Prevention relevance:   We demonstrated that δ-tocotrienol is the most active vitamin E form in inhibiting the growth of several prostate cancer cell lines. In transgenic Ptenp-/- mice, δ-tocotrienol inhibited the formation of prostate cancer. This result would encourage and help design clinical studies for the application of δ-tocotrienol for prostate cancer prevention.""","""['Hong Wang', 'William Yan', 'Yuhai Sun', 'Chung S Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Prev Res (Phila)""","""['δ-Tocopherol inhibits the development of prostate adenocarcinoma in prostate specific Pten-/- mice.', 'Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of tocopherols and tocotrienols on preneoplastic and neoplastic mouse mammary epithelial cells.', 'Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of tocopherols and tocotrienols on normal mouse mammary epithelial cells.', 'Natural forms of vitamin E and metabolites-regulation of cancer cell death and underlying mechanisms.', 'Tocotrienols: Vitamin E beyond tocopherols.', 'Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents in chronic liver diseases: Molecular mechanisms and therapy.', 'Novel Insights into the Role of the Antioxidants in Prostate Pathology.']"""

These processes leave characteristic profiles of somatic mutations called mutational signatures. Mutational signatures, including single-base substitution (SBS) signatures, may reflect the effects of exogenous or endogenous exposures.  Methods:   We used polygenic risk scores (PRS) to summarize common germline variation associated with cancer risk and other cancer-related traits and examined the association between somatic mutational profiles and germline PRS in 12 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Somatic mutational profiles were constructed from whole-exome sequencing data of primary tumors. PRS were calculated for the 12 selected cancer types and 9 non-cancer traits, including cancer risk determinants, hormonal factors, and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, using germline genetic data and published summary statistics from genome-wide association studies.  Results:   We found 17 statistically significant associations between somatic mutational profiles and germline PRS after Bonferroni correction (p < 3.15 × 10-5), including positive associations between germline inflammatory bowel disease PRS and number of somatic mutations attributed to signature SBS1 in prostate cancer and APOBEC-related signatures in breast cancer. Positive associations were also found between age at menarche PRS and mutation counts of SBS1 in overall and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Consistent with prior studies that found an inverse association between the pubertal development PRS and risk of prostate cancer, likely reflecting hormone-related mechanisms, we found an inverse association between age at menarche PRS and mutation counts of SBS1 in prostate cancer. Inverse associations were also found between several cancer PRS and tumor mutation counts.  Conclusions:   Our analysis suggests that there are robust associations between tumor somatic mutational profiles and germline PRS. These may reflect the mechanisms through hormone regulation and immune responses that contribute to cancer etiology and drive cancer progression.""","""['Yuxi Liu', 'Alexander Gusev', 'Yujing J Heng', 'Ludmil B Alexandrov', 'Peter Kraft']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['An investigation of the association of genetic susceptibility risk with somatic mutation burden in breast cancer.', 'Germline variants and somatic mutation signatures of breast cancer across populations of African and European ancestry in the US and Nigeria.', 'Network-based approaches elucidate differences within APOBEC and clock-like signatures in breast cancer.', 'Mutational spectra and mutational signatures: Insights into cancer aetiology and mechanisms of DNA damage and repair.', 'Polygenic risk scores and breast cancer risk prediction.', 'Carcino-Evo-Devo, A Theory of the Evolutionary Role of Hereditary Tumors.', 'Genomic Landscape of Normal and Breast Cancer Tissues in a Hungarian Pilot Cohort.', 'Germline Cancer Gene Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Are Associated with Local and Global Tumor Mutations.', ""Evaluation of NOTCH family genes' expression and prognostic value in prostate cancer.""]"""

However, few studies have statistically analyzed these publications. In this work, we conducted the knowledge domain and highlighted current research hotspots and emerging trends in CP/CPPS from 1970 to 2020 based on VOSviewer and CiteSpace.  Methods:   Relevant original articles were obtained from the Web of Science (WoS) database between 1970 and 2020. VOSviewer and CiteSpace software were used to perform the analysis and visualization of scientific productivity and emerging trends.  Results:   Our results show that the articles related to CP/CPPS have dramatically increased every year from 1 publication in 1970 to 111 publications in 2020. The USA dominated the field in all countries, and Queen's University (Canada) has more extensive cooperating relationships with other institutions. J. Curtis Nickel may have a significant influence on CP/CPPS research with more publications and cocitations. The Journal of Urology is the foremost productive journal and has the most citations of all the journals. A total of 11 major clusters were explored based on the reference cocitation analysis (RCA).

Previous studies on PBS arcs have primarily been focused on plan quality, and lately efforts have been made to reduce the delivery time. However, the methods presented so far suffer from slow optimization processes.Approach.We present a new method for fast robust optimization of PBS arc plans. The new method assigns a single energy layer per discretized direction prior to spot weight optimization and reduces the number of initial spots considerably compared to conventional methods. We used the new method for three prostate cancer patients with a prescribed dose to the CTV of 77 GyRBEin 35 fractions. For each of the patients, four plans were created: 2-beam IMPT (2IMPT), 1-beam PBS arc (1Arc), 1-beam PBS arc without focus on reducing upward energy jumps (1Arc_unseq) and two-beam PBS arc (2Arc).Main results.All PBS arc plans show a reduced integral dose compared to their respective 2IMPT plans. In the nominal case, the average CTV D98 and D2 metrics over the three patients were best for the 2Arc, followed by 2IMPT (D98¯/D2¯:7523/7986 cGyRBE(2IMPT), 7478/7984 cGy (1Arc), 7486/7951 cGy (1Arc_unseq), 7531/7951 cGyRBE(2Arc)). The average robust target coverage in terms of V95 of the voxelwise minimum dose distribution (evaluated over 42 scenarios) was: 98.0% (2IMPT), 88.6% (1Arc), 92.5% (1Arc_unseq), 97.3% (2Arc). The optimization time, including spot selection and spot dose computation, is longest for the 2Arc plan, but is below 6 min for all patients. The maximum estimated delivery time for all types of arc plans is just above 5 minSignificance.The ability for efficient treatment planning constitutes an important step towards clinical introduction of proton PBS arcs.""","""['Erik Engwall', 'Cecilia Battinelli', 'Viktor Wase', 'Otte Marthin', 'Lars Glimelius', 'Rasmus Bokrantz', 'Björn Andersson', 'Albin Fredriksson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Dosimetric comparison of fixed field dynamic IMRT and VMAT techniques in simultaneous integrated boost radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Spot scanning proton arc therapy reduces toxicity in oropharyngeal cancer patients.', 'Comparison of plan optimization for single and dual volumetric-modulated arc therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy during post-mastectomy regional irradiation.', 'Technical Note: Plan-delivery-time constrained inverse optimization method with minimum-MU-per-energy-layer (MMPEL) for efficient pencil beam scanning proton therapy.', 'A novel energy layer optimization framework for spot-scanning proton arc therapy.', 'FLASH instead of proton arc therapy is a more promising advancement for the next generation proton radiotherapy.', 'Beam angle optimization for proton therapy via group-sparsity based angle generation method.', 'A treatment plan optimization method with direct minimization of number of energy jumps for proton arc therapy.']"""

Posttranslational modifications characterizing receptor activation are considered potentially strong indicators of disease progression.  Methods:   The posttranscriptional regulation of leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and its novel downstream signalling activity in PCa were studied using liquid mass spectrometry, genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models, organoid assays, lentivirus packaging, infection and stable cell line construction.  Results:   In this study, the level of acetylated K620 on LIFR in its extracellular domain was shown to predict the progression and prognosis of PCa. In PCa cells, LIFR-K620 acetylation is reversibly mediated by GCN5 and SIRT2. GEM experiments and organoid assays confirmed that the loss of LIFR-K620 acetylation inhibits PCa progression. Mechanistically, K620 acetylation facilitates LIFR homodimerization and subsequently promotes LIFR-S1044 phosphorylation and activation, which further recruits PDPK1 to activate AKT signalling and sequentially enhances the GCN5 protein level to sustain the protumour level of LIFR-K620 acetylation by preventing GCN5 degradation via CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase.  Conclusions:   Acetylation of extracellular K620 on LIFR reinforces its homodimerization and integrates the activities of PDPK1, AKT, GSK3β and GCN5 to form a novel positive feedback loop in PCa; this modification is thus a promising biomarker for monitoring PCa progression.""","""['Yufeng Ding', 'Honggang Chi', 'Jialiang Shao', 'Tiezhu Shi', 'Hua Yu', 'Xiang Wang', 'Xiongjun Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Transl Med""","""['Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'Phosphorylation of LIFR promotes prostate cancer progression by activating the AKT pathway.', 'Novel Long Non-coding RNA lncAMPC Promotes Metastasis and Immunosuppression in Prostate Cancer by Stimulating LIF/LIFR Expression.', 'Phosphoinositide-dependent Kinase-1 (PDPK1) regulates serum/glucocorticoid-regulated Kinase 3 (SGK3) for prostate cancer cell survival.', 'Targeting LIF/LIFR signaling in cancer.', 'Targeting epigenetic regulators to overcome drug resistance in cancers.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Multiple Roles of SIRT2 in Regulating Physiological and Pathological Signal Transduction.', 'Lysine Acetyltransferases and Their Role in AR Signaling and Prostate Cancer.', 'The Pleiotropic role, functions and targeted therapies of LIF/LIFR axis in cancer: Old spectacles with new insights.']"""

A lateral projection of the C-arm setup was considered in the current study. The ambient dose equivalent rate was measured using an electronic dosimeter in 30° steps all around for 1, and 1.6-m heights as well as 1, and 2-m distances away from a water tank (scattering medium). By assuming a typical workload, the annual ambient dose and a maximum number of permissible operations were determined. For a worst-case scenario, the dose was used to estimate the ERR for various organs including prostate, ovary, breast, lung, thyroid, and colon for attained ages of 35, 40, and 50 years. The maximum ambient dose equivalent rate was seen at 330° and 30° (about 600 µSv/h at 1 m height and a distance of 1 m from the scattering medium). The corresponding permissible workload for an OR staff was about 30,660 operations. Based on the obtained results, 60° next to the image intensifier was the optimum position for the surgeon, while 30° next to the tube was the worst position because of backscattered radiation.

As natural vehicles, EVs may exhibit higher delivery efficiency, lower immunogenicity, and better compatibility than existing RNA carriers. A major limitation of their therapeutic use is the shortage of efficient, robust, and scalable methods to load siRNA of interest. Here, we report a novel strategy using polycationic membrane-penetrating peptide TAT to encapsulate siRNAs into EVs. Three TAT peptides were co-expressed with DRBD as 3TD fusion protein. The sequence-independent binding of DRBD facilitates multiplex genes targeting of mixed siRNAs. Functional assays for siRNA-mediated gene silencing of CRPC were performed after engineered EVs treatment. EVs were isolated using differential centrifugation from WPMY-1 cell culture medium. The increase of merged yellow fluorescence in the engineered EVs showed by TIRFM and the decrease in zeta potential absolute values certified the co-localization of siRNA with EVs, which indicated that siRNA had been successfully delivered into WPMY-1 EVs. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that the mRNA level of FLOH1, NKX3, and DHRS7 was dramatically decreased when cells were treated with engineered EVs loaded with siRNAs mixtures relative to the level of untreated cells.

This retrospective study analyses the accuracy of 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT in detecting csPCa as a primary diagnostic tool and directly compares it with mpMRI prostate in treatment-naive patients. The two modalities are then correlated to determine whether they are better in combination, than either alone.  Methods:   This is a retrospective dual-institution study of patients who underwent contemporaneous MRI and PSMA-PET between January 2017 and March 2020 with histologic confirmation. The images were re-reviewed and concordance between modalities assessed. Results were compared with histopathology to determine the ability of MRI and PSMA-PET to detect csPCA.  Results:   MRI and PSMA-PET detected the same index lesion in 90.8% of cases with a kappa of 0.82. PET detected an additional 6.2% of index lesions which were MRI occult. MRI detected an additional 3.1% which were PET occult. No additional csPCa was identified on pathology which was not seen on imaging. The sensitivity of PSMA-PET in detecting csPCa is 96.7% and that of MRI is 93.4% with no statistically significant difference between the two (P = 0.232). Both modalities detected all four cases of non-csPCa with these being considered false positives.  Conclusion:   Both mpMRI and 18F-DCFPyL-PSMA-PET/CT have high sensitivity for detecting csPCa with high agreement between modalities. There were no synchronous csPCa lesions detected on pathology that were not detected on imaging too.""","""['Nishanthinie Parathithasan', 'Elisa Perry', 'Kim Taubman', 'Justin Hegarty', 'Arpit Talwar', 'Lih-Ming Wong', 'Tom Sutherland']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['Synchronous vs independent reading of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to improve diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Prospective analysis of clinically significant prostate cancer detection with 18FDCFPyL PET/MRI compared to multiparametric MRI: a comparison with the histopathology in the radical prostatectomy specimen, the ProStaPET study.', 'Detection of prostate cancer with 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT compared to final histopathology of radical prostatectomy specimens: is PSMA-targeted biopsy feasible?

The parameters tested included four different tissue washes, four methods of protein denaturation, four methods of trypsin digestion (different trypsin densities, sprayers, and incubation times), and five matrix deposition methods (different sprayers, settings, and matrix concentrations). Evaluation criteria were the number of detected and excluded peaks, percentage of high mass peaks, signal-to-noise ratio, spatial localization, and average intensities of identified peptides, all of which were integrated into a weighted quality evaluation scoring system. Based on these scores, the optimized protocol included an ice-cold EtOH+H2 O wash, a 5 min heating step at 95°C, tryptic digestion incubated for 17h at 37°C and CHCA matrix deposited at a final amount of 1.8 μg/mm2 .

The remaining activity in the patient and the dose rate were correlated. From frequent intratherapeutic measurements (biexponential fit) scenarios for discharging patients are deduced.  Results:   Thirty-four per cent of all patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA received 3 to 5 cycles per calendar year. The dose limit of 1 mSv per calendar year (German Law) at a distance of 2 m from the patient would be exceeded in 10 % and 15 % of the treated patients if discharged 72 hours after treatment given 3 and 4 cycles per calendar year, respectively.

The objective of our multi-rater study was to compare intra- and inter-rater variability of PV from manual planimetry and ellipsoid formulas.  Methods:   Forty treatment-naive patients who underwent prostate MRI were selected from a local database. PV and corresponding PSA density (PSAd) were estimated on 3D T2-weighted MRI (3 T) by 7 independent radiologists using the traditional ellipsoid formula (TEF), the newer biproximate ellipsoid formula (BPEF), and the manual planimetry method (MPM) used as ground truth. Intra- and inter-rater variability was calculated using the mixed model-based intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).  Results:   Mean volumes were 67.00 (± 36.61), 66.07 (± 35.03), and 64.77 (± 38.27) cm3 with the TEF, BPEF, and MPM methods, respectively. Both TEF and BPEF overestimated PV relative to MPM, with the former presenting significant differences (+ 1.91 cm3, IQ = [- 0.33 cm3, 5.07 cm3], p val = 0.03). Both intra- (ICC > 0.90) and inter-rater (ICC > 0.90) reproducibility were excellent. MPM had the highest inter-rater reproducibility (ICC = 0.999). Inter-rater PV variation led to discrepancies in classification according to the clinical criterion of PSAd > 0.15 ng/mL for 2 patients (5%), 7 patients (17.5%), and 9 patients (22.5%) when using MPM, TEF, and BPEF, respectively.  Conclusion:   PV measurements using ellipsoid formulas and MPM are highly reproducible. MPM is a robust method for PV assessment and PSAd calculation, with the lowest variability. TEF showed a high degree of concordance with MPM but a slight overestimation of PV. Precise anatomic landmarks as defined with the BPEF led to a more accurate PV estimation, but also to a higher variability.

However, given the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in TPBx remains controversial according to the current guidelines, we also investigated the safety and side effects of TPBx with and without antibiotic prophylaxis.  Materials and methods:   A total of 777 patients who underwent prostate biopsy were enrolled in this study in accordance with the criteria. The primary outcome was pooled infectious complications (sepsis, fever, symptomatic urinary tract infection and urinary retention), and the secondary outcome was prostate cancer detection rate.  Results:   Findings showed that TPBx and TRBx were equivalent in terms of prostate cancer detection rate (TPBx: 50.4% vs. TRBx: 47.3%; P = 0.424) and urinary retention (TPBx: 5% vs. TRBx: 6.3%; P = 0.451).

Notably, for TPBx, patients who received a single dose of cephazolin prophylaxis were not associated with the risk of sepsis (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.13-4.63; P = 0.783) and symptomatic urinary tract infection (RR: 1.17, 95% CI: 0.24-5.74; P = 0.848) in contrast to patients who did not receive any antibiotic prophylaxis. Meanwhile, no effects on prostate cancer detection rate and urinary retention were observed in the TPBx group.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicated that TPBx significantly reduced infectious complications compared with TRBx and should therefore be preferred. Importantly, we need to re-examine whether the antibiotic prophylaxis should be routinely applied before TPBx in consideration of increasing antibiotic resistance. This result complements the current national guidelines. Nevertheless, future studies on this topic with improved quality and increased sample size are still needed to minimise bacterial resistance.""","""['Junwei He', 'Zhenlang Guo', 'Yanqin Huang', 'Zhaohui Wang', 'Lijuan Huang', 'Baimou Li', 'Zunguang Bai', 'Shusheng Wang', 'Songtao Xiang', 'Chiming Gu', 'Jun Pan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Complication Rate After Antibiotic Prophylaxis with Fosfomycin Versus Fluorochinolones or β-lactam Antibiotics in Patients Undergoing Prostate Biopsy: A Propensity Score-adjusted Analysis.', 'Comparison between Ultrasound Guided Transperineal and Transrectal Prostate Biopsy: A Prospective, Randomized, and Controlled Trial.', 'Rationale and protocol for randomized study of transrectal and transperineal prostate biopsy efficacy and complications (ProBE-PC study).', 'Comparison of diagnostic efficacy between transrectal and transperineal prostate biopsy: A propensity score-matched study.', 'The augmented prophylactic antibiotic could be more efficacious in patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The downstream genes and pathways of UAP1L1 were explored using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), and screened by qRT-PCR and western blot. The effects of CDCA8 on prostate cancer cells were also verified in vitro, which was through detecting the change of proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of prostate cancer cells after CDCA8 knockdown.

Methods:   Under the guidance of a stereoscopic microscope, the anatomy of the individual prostate lobes in male Balb/c athymic nude mice was investigated, and LNCaP cells were inoculated into the mouse dorsal prostate (DP) to generate orthotopic tumors that mimicked the pathophysiological process of prostate cancer in humans. Real-time ultrasound imaging was used to monitor orthotopic prostate tumorigenesis, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) was used to characterize tumor angiogenesis, and macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of tumors were described.  Results:   The DP had a trigonal bipyramid-shape and were located at the base of the seminal vesicles. After orthotopic inoculation, gray scale ultrasound imaging showed progressive changes in tumor echotexture, shape and location, and tumors tended to protrude into the bladder. After 8 weeks, the tumor take rate was 65% (n = 13/20 mice). On CEUS, signal intensity increased rapidly, peaked, and decreased gradually. Observations of gross specimens showed orthotopic prostate tumors were well circumscribed, round, dark brown, and soft, with a smooth outer surface and a glossy appearance. Microscopically, tumor cells were arranged in acini encircled by fibrous septa with variably thickened walls, mimicking human adenocarcinoma.  Conclusions:   This study describes a successful approach to establishing an orthotopic LNCaP xenograft Balb/c athymic nude mouse model. The model requires a thorough understanding of mouse prostate anatomy and proper technique. The model represents a valuable tool for the in vivo study of the biological processes involved in angiogenesis in prostate cancer and preclinical evaluations of novel anti-angiogenic therapies.""","""['Weiyong Liu', 'Yunkai Zhu', 'Lei Ye', 'Yajuan Zhu', 'Yuhao Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Correction: Establishment of an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft mouse model using microscope-guided orthotopic injection of LNCaP cells into the dorsal lobe of the mouse prostate.', 'Comparison of tumor angiogenesis in subcutaneous and orthotopic LNCaP mouse models using contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging.', 'Real-Time GFP Intravital Imaging of the Differences in Cellular and Angiogenic Behavior of Subcutaneous and Orthotopic Nude-Mouse Models of Human PC-3 Prostate Cancer.', 'Human prostate tumor angiogenesis in nude mice: metalloprotease and plasminogen activator activities during tumor growth and neovascularization of subcutaneously injected matrigel impregnated with human prostate tumor cells.', 'Metastatic model for human prostate cancer using orthotopic implantation in nude mice.', 'Obesity and cancer: Mouse models used in studies.', 'Correction: Establishment of an orthotopic prostate cancer xenograft mouse model using microscope-guided orthotopic injection of LNCaP cells into the dorsal lobe of the mouse prostate.']"""

Results showed that feijoa extracts had cancer-specific anti-proliferative activity on the LNCaP cell line. The anticancer activity of feijoa extracts was shown through activation of the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway based on the increase of sub-G1 phase in the cell cycle, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential, as well as the elevated caspase 3, 8, and 9 activity in the treated LNCaP cells. The anti-cancer activity of feijoa extracts could be attributed to the high total phenolic contents (0.14-0.37 mg GAE/mg dw) and, in particular, the high ellagic acid content (2.662-9.119 μg/mg dw).

In this paper, a microfluidic chip integrated with electrodes for dielectrophoretic (DEP) separation, microchannels for electrochemical nanoprobes binding and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) detection was proposed for the sensitive and rapid detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in whole blood. The functional units, which could realize cell separation, PSA derivatization (binding of electrochemical nanoprobes), capture and detection, were integrated on the microfluidic chip. The well-designed V-shaped interdigital electrode arrays provided DEP separation for blood cells with efficiency as high as 98%. Particularly, DEP effect significantly improved the sensitivity of PSA detection and reduced the detection limit by two orders of magnitude. In order to achieve sensitive detection of PSA, binding of electrochemical nanoprobes and then DPV detection was selected and integrated following the DEP separation. A sandwich structure based on electrochemical nanoprobes and dual-aptamers for on-chip DPV detection was proposed, which included self-synthesized electrochemical nanoprobes bovine serum albumin/detection aptamer 2/polythionine@gold nanoparticles (BSA/Apt2/PThi@Au NPs), target PSA, and sensing interface 6-mercaptohexanol/capture aptamer 1/gold nanoparticles on gold electrode (MCH/Apt1/Au NPs/Au). The method of quantitative detection of PSA in whole blood was then established. The excellent performance of the microfluidic chip allowed the determination of PSA in whole blood in the range of 1 pg/mL ∼10 ng/mL with an ultralow limit of detection of 0.25 pg/mL, which was better than the results obtained by conventional methods.""","""['Xiaoli Wang', 'Xinyu He', 'Zhiheng He', 'Liwei Hou', 'Chuang Ge', 'Li Wang', 'Shunbo Li', 'Yi Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['A Sensitive Aptamer-Based Biosensor for Electrochemical Quantification of PSA as a Specific Diagnostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Detection of VEGF165 in Whole Blood by Differential Pulse Voltammetry Based on a Centrifugal Microfluidic Chip.', 'Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'Recent Progress of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Bacteria Detection.', 'Affinity-based electrochemical sensors for biomolecular detection in whole blood.', 'Recent progress of microfluidic chips in immunoassay.', 'Numerical Study on a Bio-Inspired Micropillar Array Electrode in a Microfluidic Device.']"""

Prostate cancer cells secrete factors, including serine proteases, that are capable of influencing the behavior of surrounding cells. Some of these proteases activate protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2 ), which is expressed by osteoblasts (bone-forming cells) and precursors of osteoclasts (bone-resorbing cells). The aim of the current study was to investigate a possible role for PAR2 in regulating the behavior of bone cells exposed to metastatic prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   The effect of medium conditioned by the PC3, DU145, and MDA-PCa-2b prostate cancer cell lines was investigated in assays of bone cell function using cells isolated from wildtype and PAR2 -null mice. Osteoclast differentiation was assessed by counting tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive multinucleate cells in bone marrow cultured in osteoclastogenic medium. Osteoblasts were isolated from calvariae of neonatal mice, and BrdU incorporation was used to assess their proliferation. Assays of alkaline phosphatase activity and quantitative PCR analysis of osteoblastic gene expression were used to assess osteoblast differentiation. Responses of osteoblasts to medium conditioned by MDA-PCa-2b cells were analyzed by RNAseq.  Results:   Conditioned medium (CM) from all three cell lines inhibited osteoclast differentiation independently of PAR2 . Media from PC3 and DU145 cells had no effect on assays of osteoblast function. Medium conditioned by MDA-PCa-2b cells stimulated BrdU incorporation in both wildtype and PAR2 -null osteoblasts but increased alkaline phosphatase activity and Runx2 and Col1a1 expression in wildtype but not PAR2 -null cells. Functional enrichment analysis of RNAseq data identified enrichment of multiple gene ontology terms associated with lysosomal function in both wildtype and PAR2 -null cells in response to MDA-PCa-2b-CM. Analysis of individual genes identified osteogenesis-associated genes that were either upregulated by MDA-PCa-2b-CM selectively in wildtype cells or downregulated selectively in PAR2 -null cells.  Conclusions:   Factors secreted by prostate cancer cells influence bone cell behavior through both PAR2 -dependent and -independent mechanisms. Both PAR2 -independent suppression of osteoclast differentiation and PAR2 -dependent stimulation of osteogenesis are likely to determine the nature of prostate cancer metastases in bone.""","""['Charles N Pagel', 'Pamu K Kularathna', 'Reza Sanaei', 'Neil D Young', 'John D Hooper', 'Eleanor J Mackie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate cancer cells induce osteoblast differentiation through a Cbfa1-dependent pathway.', 'Prostate cancer cells-osteoblast interaction shifts expression of growth/survival-related genes in prostate cancer and reduces expression of osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts.', 'Notch signaling and ERK activation are important for the osteomimetic properties of prostate cancer bone metastatic cell lines.', 'Cellular and molecular effects of growth hormone and estrogen on human bone cells.', 'Prostate cancer and bone: clinical presentation and molecular mechanisms.']"""

The canine PCa model is currently the only large animal model which can be used to test new preclinical interventions but is costly and availability is sparse. As an alternative, we developed an orthotopic human prostate tumor model in an immunosuppressed New Zealand White rabbit. Rabbits are phylogenetically closer to humans, their prostate gland is anatomically similar, and its size allows for clinically-relevant testing of interventions.  Methods:   Rabbits were immunosuppressed via injection of cyclosporine. Human PC3pipGFP PCa cells were injected into the prostate via either (a) laparotomy or (b) transabdominal ultrasound (US) guided injection. Tumor growth was monitored using US and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) imaging using nanobubbles and Lumason microbubbles was also performed to examine imaging features and determine the optimal contrast dose required for enhanced visualization of the tumor. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry analyses of the collected tissues were performed to validate tumor morphology and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression.  Results:   Immunosuppression and tumor growth were, in general, well-tolerated by the rabbits. Fourteen out of 20 rabbits, with an average age of 8 months, successfully grew detectable tumors from Day 14 onwards after cell injection. The tumor growth rate was 39 ± 25 mm2 per week. CEUS and MRI of tumors appear hypoechoic and T2 hypointense, respectively, relative to normal prostate tissue. Minimally invasive US-guided tumor cell injection proved to be a better method compared to laparotomy due to the shorter recovery time required for the rabbits following injection. Among the rabbits that grew tumors, seven had tumors both inside and outside the prostate, three had tumors only inside the prostate, and four had tumors exclusively outside of the prostate. All tumors expressed the PSMA receptor.  Conclusions:   We have established, for the first time, an orthotopic PCa rabbit model via percutaneous US-guided tumor cell inoculation.

However, its role in ovarian cancer is barely known. This study was carried out to investigate the role of PRNCR1 and the underlying mechanisms in OC. The expression of PRNCR1 and miR-653-5p in OC cell lines and tissues were detected by qRT-PCR. The expression of ELF2 protein was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was measured by colony formation and MTT assay. Cell invasion and migration were evaluated by Transwell and wound healing assay. Luciferase reporter assay and RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation assay were performed to determine the interaction between miR-653-5p and PRNCR1, as well as between miR-653-5p and ELF2. In vivo tumor xenograft model was established to evaluate the role of PRNCR1 in tumor growth. Our results demonstrated that PRNCR1 was significantly upregulated in both OC cell lines and tissues, and high expression of PRNCR1 was correlated with poor survival of OC patients. Overexpression of PRNCR1 accelerated OC cell invasion, migration and proliferation. Besides, the expression of PRNCR1 was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-653-5p, while positively correlated with the expression of E74-like factor 2 in OC tissues. Importantly, ELF2 could target miR-653-5p, and PRNCR1 increased the expression levels of ELF2 by sponging miR-653-5p in OC cells. Furthermore, the miR-145-5p/ELF2 axis was involved in the regulation of PRNCR1 in OC progression in vivo.

Subjects and methods:   We analysed baseline data of 6754 men, aged 50-75 years divided into: lifelong non-smokers, former smokers, and current smokers. We examined total testosterone (TT, normal range ≥10 nmol/L) and sexual function variables: self-reported sexual activity, low libido, and erectile dysfunction (ED). Differences between current vs non-smokers and former vs current smokers were analysed using the chi-square test, linear and logistic regressions.  Results:   A total of 3069 (45.4%) men were non-smokers, 2673 (39.6%) former smokers, and 1012 (15%) current smokers. Current smokers were significantly younger than former and non-smokers (mean age 61.6, 63.2, and 62.7 years, respectively), leaner (mean body mass index 27.0, 27.7, and 27.2 kg/m2 , respectively), and had less hypertension (32.4%, 41.6%, and 36.8%, respectively; all P < 0.01).

Patients and methods:   A bi-centric, secondary analysis of two previous, prospective cohort studies was performed in 318 patients with biopsy confirmed PCa and who were scheduled for RARP.

In this scenario, we performed a prospective analysis of outcomes of our patients undergoing SDD protocol after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Materials and Methods: The SDD criteria included patients with no intraoperative complications, stable postoperative hemoglobin levels (compared with preoperative values), stable vital signs, normal urine output, ambulation with assistance and independently without dizziness, tolerance of clear liquids without nausea or vomiting, pain control with oral medication, and patient/family confidence with SDD. Patients older than 70 years, concomitant general surgery operations, multiple comorbidities, and complex procedures such as salvage surgery were excluded from our protocol. Results: Of the 101 patients who met the criteria for SDD, 73 (72%) had an effective SDD. All SDF (same day discharge failure) patients were discharged one day after surgery. Intraoperative characteristics were not statistically different with a median operative time of 92 (81-107) vs 103 (91-111) minutes for SDD and SDF, respectively. Of the 28 SDF patients, the most common reasons for staying were anesthesia-related factors of nausea (35%), drowsiness (7%), patient/caregiver preference (25%), pain (14%), labile blood pressure (7%), arrhythmia (7%), and dizziness (7%). There was no significant difference in readmission rates, complication rates, or postoperative pain scores between SDD and SDF patients. Conclusions: In our experience, SDD for patients undergoing RARP can be safely and feasibly incorporated into a clinical care pathway without increasing readmission rates. We were effective in 72% of cases because of coordinated care between anesthetics, nursing staff, and appropriate patient selection. We also believe that incorporating pre- and postoperative patient education and assurance is crucial to minimize their exposure to COVID-19 during the surgical treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Sunil S Reddy', 'Jonathan Noël', 'Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'Seetharam Bhat', 'Roshane Perera', 'Travis Rogers', 'Daniel Stirt', 'Janice Doss', 'Cathy Jenson', 'John Andrich', 'Vipul R Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Same-day discharge surgery for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the era of ERAS and prehabilitation pathways: a contemporary, comparative, feasibility study.', 'Same day discharge for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a prospective cohort study documenting an Australian approach.', 'Multi-Institutional Assessment of Routine Same Day Discharge Surgery for Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Same-day discharge (SDD) vs standard enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols for major colorectal surgery: a systematic review.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and androgen-ablation therapy halts disease progression. However, a significant number of prostate cancer patients develop resistance against anti-androgens, and this incurable disease is termed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We have shown that combined inhibition of OGT and the transcription elongation kinase CDK9 induce CRPC-selective anti-proliferative effects. Here, we explain the functional basis for these combinatorial effects.  Methods:   We used comprehensive mass spectrometry profiling of short-term CDK9 inhibitor effects on O-GlcNAcylated proteins in an isogenic cell line system that models transition from PC to CRPC. In addition, we used both ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiling, and pulldown experiments in multiple CRPC models. Finally, we validated our findings in prostate cancer patient samples.  Results:   Inhibition of CDK9 results in an OGT-dependent remodeling of the proteome in prostate cancer cells. More specifically, the activity of the DNA damage repair protein MRE11 is regulated in response to CDK9 inhibition in an OGT-dependent manner. MRE11 is enriched at the O-GlcNAc-marked loci. CDK9 inhibition does not decrease the expression of mRNAs whose genes are bound by both O-GlcNAc and MRE11. Combined inhibition of CDK9 and OGT or MRE11 further decreases RNA polymerase II activity, induces DNA damage signaling, and blocks the survival of prostate cancer cells. These effects are seen in CRPC cells but not in normal prostate cells. Mechanistically, OGT activity is required for MRE11 chromatin-loading in cells treated with CDK9 inhibitor. Finally, we show that MRE11 and O-GlcNAc are enriched at the prostate cancer-specific small nucleotide polymorphic sites, and the loss of MRE11 activity results in a hyper-mutator phenotype in patient tumors.  Conclusions:   Both OGT and MRE11 are essential for the repair of CDK9 inhibitor-induced DNA damage. Our study raises the possibility of targeting CDK9 to elicit DNA damage in CRPC setting as an adjuvant to other treatments.""","""['Aishwarya Gondane', 'Samuel Girmay', 'Alma Helevä', 'Satu Pallasaho', 'Massimo Loda', 'Harri M Itkonen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biomed Sci""","""['O-GlcNAc transferase maintains metabolic homeostasis in response to CDK9 inhibition.', 'High OGT activity is essential for MYC-driven proliferation of prostate cancer cells.', 'Inhibition of O-GlcNAc Transferase Renders Prostate Cancer Cells Dependent on CDK9.', 'O-GlcNAc Transferase - An Auxiliary Factor or a Full-blown Oncogene?', 'O-GlcNAcylation and chromatin remodeling in mammals: an up-to-date overview.', 'Castration-resistant prostate cancer cells are dependent on the high activity of CDK7.', 'O-GlcNAc transferase maintains metabolic homeostasis in response to CDK9 inhibition.']"""

At 10 nM, IDD-1010 has induced increased apoptosis and mitotic arrest of PC3-Luc prostate cancer cells, causing aneuploidy and cell death at higher concentrations. Toxicology studies indicate that the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of IDD-1010 is 150 mg/kg in mice; equivalent to about 12.2 mg/kg of body weight, or to about an 850 mg dose for a patient weighing 70 kg. The MTD-treated mice exhibited weight gain similar to that of the control group, with no gross pathological signs at 14 days post-dosing. At a lower dose, IDD-1010 treatment did not lead to any significant weight loss in mice, although decreased the tumor volume stemming from injecting cancer cells into the dorsal loop of mouse prostate, and it was found to be more potent than Paclitaxel (reference drug). Similarly, IDD-1010 treatment significantly reduced tumor weight and thereby increased the percentage of mice survival as compared to reference drug-treated and control groups.

Since T850 phosphorylation was reported to affect AR function, we created the phosphomimetic mutation T850D.

In the androgen responsive LNCaP cell line grown in medium with low androgen levels, we observed a growth advantage for cells in which the endogenous AR was replaced by AR T850D. Despite the distance to the AF2 site, the AR T850D LBD displayed an increased affinity for coactivator peptides as well as the 23FQNLF27 motif of AR itself. Molecular Dynamics simulations confirm allosteric transmission of the T850D mutation towards the AF2 site via extended hydrogen bond formation between coactivator peptide and AF2 site.

Higher immunohistochemistry (IHC) expressions of ARPC1B were observed in localized and castrate resistant PCa (CRPC) vs. benign prostate tissue (p < 0.01). Additionally, 47% of patients with grade group 5 (GG) showed high ARPC1B expression vs. other GG patients. Assessing ARPC1B expression in association with two of the common genetic aberrations in PCa (ERG and PTEN) showed significant association to overall and cause-specific survival for combined assessment of ARPC1B and PTEN, and ARPC1B and ERG. Knockdown of ARPC1B impaired the migration and invasion of PC3 and DU145 PCa cells via downregulation of Aurora A kinase (AURKA) and resulted in the arrest of the cells in the G2/M checkpoint of the cell cycle. Additionally, higher ARPC1B expression was observed in stable PC3-ERG cells compared to normal PC3, supporting the association between ERG and ARPC1B. Our findings implicate the role of ARPC1B in PCa invasion and metastasis in association with ERG and further support its prognostic value as a biomarker in association with ERG and PTEN in identifying aggressive phenotypes of PCa cancer.""","""['Yaser Gamallat', 'Hend Zaaluk', 'Ealia Khosh Kish', 'Ramy Abdelsalam', 'Konstantinos Liosis', 'Sunita Ghosh', 'Tarek A Bismar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['ING3 is associated with increased cell invasion and lethal outcome in ERG-negative prostate cancer patients.', 'P2X4 purinergic receptors offer a therapeutic target for aggressive prostate cancer.', 'PTEN deletion and heme oxygenase-1 overexpression cooperate in prostate cancer progression and are associated with adverse clinical outcome.', 'Characterizing the molecular features of ERG-positive tumors in primary and castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.']"""

The compound, 4-acetylantroquinonol B (4AAQB), is isolated from Antrodia cinnamomea (commonly known as Niu-Chang-Chih), which has been shown to inhibit cancer growth. However, the anticancer activity of 4AAQB has not previously been examined in prostate cancer. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 4AAQB on cancer and angiogenesis, as well as to explore its mechanism of action. Human prostate cancer cells (PC3) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were used in cell viability, cell migration, and cell cycle functional assays to evaluate the anticancer and antiangiogenic efficacy of 4AAQB in vitro. The effects of 4AAQB in vivo were determined using xenograft and angiogenesis models. The signaling events downstream of 4AAQB were also examined. The 4AAQB compound inhibited PC3 cell growth and migration, and reduced in vivo cancer growth, as shown in a subcutaneous xenograft model. Furthermore, 4AAQB inhibited HUVEC migration, tube formation, and aortic ring sprouting; it also reduced neovascularization in a Matrigel implant angiogenesis assay in vivo. The 4AAQB compound also decreased metastasis in the PC3 prostate cancer model in vivo. Serum or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Ak strain transforming (Akt), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase ½ (ERK ½) phosphorylation were attenuated by 4AAQB in both PC3 and HUVEC.

One of the reasons that cancer cells show resistance to ionizing radiation is hypoxia, defined as a low level of oxygenation, which is typical for solid tumors. In the hypoxic environment, cancer cells are 2-3 times more resistant to ionizing radiation than normoxic cells. To overcome this important impediment, radiosensitizers should be introduced to cancer therapy. When modified with an electrophilic substituent, nucleosides may undergo efficient dissociative electron attachment (DEA) that leaves behind nucleoside radicals, which, in secondary reactions, are able to induce DNA damage, leading to cancer cell death. We report the radiosensitizing effect of one of the best-known DEA-type radiosensitizers-5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU)-on breast (MCF-7) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells under both normoxia and hypoxia. MCF-7 and PC3 cells were treated with BrdU to investigate the effect of hypoxia on cell proliferation, incorporation into DNA and radiosensitivity. While the oxygen concentration did not significantly affect the efficiency of BrdU incorporation into DNA or the proliferation of tumor cells, the radiosensitizing effect of BrdU on hypoxic cells was more evident than on normoxic cells. Further mechanistic studies performed with the use of flow cytometry showed that under hypoxia, BrdU increased the level of histone H2A.X phosphorylation after X-ray exposure to a greater extent than under normal oxygenation conditions. These results confirm that the formation of double-strand breaks in hypoxic BrdU-treated cancer cells is more efficient. In addition, by performing stationary radiolysis of BrdU solution in the presence of an ●OH radical scavenger, we compared the degree of its electron-induced degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It was determined that radiodegradation under anaerobic conditions was almost twice as high as that under aerobic conditions.""","""['Magdalena Zdrowowicz', 'Paulina Spisz', 'Aleksandra Hać', 'Anna Herman-Antosiewicz', 'Janusz Rak']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""[""5-Iodo-4-thio-2'-Deoxyuridine as a Sensitizer of X-ray Induced Cancer Cell Killing."", 'Comparison of the bromodeoxyuridine-mediated sensitization effects between low-LET and high-LET ionizing radiation on DNA double-strand breaks.', ""Why Does the Type of Halogen Atom Matter for the Radiosensitizing Properties of 5-Halogen Substituted 4-Thio-2'-Deoxyuridines?"", 'Mechanisms of Damage to DNA Labeled with Electrophilic Nucleobases Induced by Ionizing or UV Radiation.', 'Chemical modification of radiation effects.', 'Electron and Photon Interactions with Bio (Related) Molecules.', 'Differential Radiomodulating Action of Olea europaea L. cv.

This study investigated whether and how Sp1 plays a crucial role in the process of VM in human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, PC-3 and DU145. A cell viability assay and three-dimensional culture VM tube formation assay were performed. Protein and mRNA expression levels were detected by Western blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The nuclear twist expression was observed by immunofluorescence assay. A co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed. Mithramycin A (MiA) and Sp1 siRNA significantly decreased serum-induced VM, whereas Sp1 overexpression caused a significant induction of VM. Serum-upregulated vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) protein and mRNA expression levels were decreased after MiA treatment or Sp1 silencing. The protein expression and the nuclear localization of twist were increased by serum, which was effectively inhibited after MiA treatment or Sp1 silencing. The interaction between Sp1 and twist was reduced by MiA. On the contrary, Sp1 overexpression enhanced VE-cadherin and twist expressions. Serum phosphorylated AKT and raised matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and laminin subunit 5 gamma-2 (LAMC2) expressions. MiA or Sp1 silencing impaired these effects. However, Sp1 overexpression upregulated phosphor-AKT, MMP-2 and LAMC2 expressions. Serum-upregulated Sp1 was significantly reduced by an AKT inhibitor, wortmannin.

In recent years, canine PC has been shown to resemble human castrate-resistant prostate cancer. The influx and efflux of testosterone in prostatic luminal cells are regulated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, human PC generally lacks P-gp expression and maintains the expression of androgen receptors (ARs). However, this co-expression has not previously been investigated in dogs. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate AR and P-gp co-expression to elucidate these protein patterns in canine prostate samples. We identified AR/P-gp double immunofluorescence co-expression of both proteins in normal luminal cells. However, in canine PC, cells lack AR expression and exhibit increased P-gp expression. These results were confirmed by gene expression analyses. Overall, our results strongly suggest that normal canine prostate testosterone influx may be regulated by P-gp expression, and that during progression to PC, prostatic cells lack AR expression and P-gp overexpress.

Phoenix Rising is however usurped in cancer, potentially nullifying pro-apoptotic therapies. Cytotoxic therapies also promote cancer cell plasticity through epigenetic reprogramming, leading to epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT), chemo-resistance and tumor progression. We explored the relationship between such scenarios, setting-up an innovative, straightforward one-pot in vitro model of therapy-induced prostate cancer repopulation. Cancer (castration-resistant PC3 and androgen-sensitive LNCaP), or normal (RWPE-1) prostate cells, are treated with etoposide and left recovering for 18 days. After a robust apoptotic phase, PC3 setup a coordinate tissue-like response, repopulating and acquiring EMT and chemo-resistance; repopulation occurs via Phoenix Rising, being dependent on high PGE-2 levels achieved through caspase-3-promoted signaling; epigenetic inhibitors interrupt Phoenix Rising after PGE-2, preventing repopulation. Instead, RWPE-1 repopulate via Phoenix Rising without reprogramming, EMT or chemo-resistance, indicating that only cancer cells require reprogramming to complete Phoenix Rising. Intriguingly, LNCaP stop Phoenix-Rising after PGE-2, failing repopulating, suggesting that the propensity to engage/complete Phoenix Rising may influence the outcome of pro-apoptotic therapies. Concluding, we established a reliable system where to study prostate cancer repopulation, showing that epigenetic reprogramming assists Phoenix Rising to promote post-therapy cancer repopulation and acquired cell-resistance (CRAC).""","""['Francesca Corsi', 'Francesco Capradossi', 'Andrea Pelliccia', 'Stefania Briganti', 'Emanuele Bruni', 'Enrico Traversa', 'Francesco Torino', 'Albrecht Reichle', 'Lina Ghibelli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Metabolic Reprogramming of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells as a Response to Chemotherapy.', 'Nimotuzumab inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by targeting the Akt/YB-1/AR axis.', 'Crosstalk between epithelial-mesenchymal transition and castration resistance mediated by Twist1/AR signaling in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition regulators in prostate cancer: Androgens and beyond.', 'Cell death under epithelial-mesenchymal transition control in prostate cancer therapeutic response.', 'Intratumor Heterogeneity and Treatment Resistance of Solid Tumors with a Focus on Polyploid/Senescent Giant Cancer Cells (PGCCs).', 'Cancer cell repopulation after therapy: which is the mechanism?', 'Safe-Shields: Basal and Anti-UV Protection of Human Keratinocytes by Redox-Active Cerium Oxide Nanoparticles Prevents UVB-Induced Mutagenesis.', 'Androgen Deprivation Freezes Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells in a Reversible, Genetically Unstable Quasi-Apoptotic State, Bursting into Full Apoptosis upon Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibition.', 'Apoptosis inhibition restrains primary malignant traits in different Drosophila cancer models.']"""

Therefore, this study investigated the effect of activation and inhibition of androgen signaling on PSMA expression levels in vitro and compared these findings with PSMA levels in PCa patients receiving systemic therapy. To this end, LAPC4, LNCaP, and C4-2 PCa cells were treated with various concentrations of the synthetic androgen R1881 and antiandrogens. Changes in FOLH1 mRNA were determined using qPCR. Open access databases were used for ChIP-Seq and tissue expression analysis. Changes in PSMA protein were determined using western blot. For PSMA staining in patients' specimens, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. Results revealed that treatment with the synthetic androgen R1881 led to decreased FOLH1 mRNA and PSMA protein. This effect was partially reversed by antiandrogen treatment. However, AR ChIP-Seq analysis revealed no canonical AR binding sites in the regulatory elements of the FOLH1 gene. IHC analysis indicated that androgen deprivation only resulted in increased PSMA expression in patients with low PSMA levels. The data demonstrate that AR activation and inhibition affects PSMA protein levels via a possible non-canonical mechanism.

We aimed to assess pain and patient-centric health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures in patients in the trial.  Methods:   In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 study, patients (aged ≥18 years) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and gene alterations to one of 15 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM [cohort A] and BRIP1, BARD1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L [cohort B]) and disease progression after a previous next-generation hormonal drug were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive olaparib tablets (300 mg orally twice daily) or a control drug (enzalutamide tablets [160 mg orally once daily] or abiraterone tablets [1000 mg orally once daily] plus prednisone tablets [5 mg orally twice daily]), stratified by previous taxane use and measurable disease. The primary endpoint (radiographical progression-free survival in cohort A) has been previously reported. The prespecified secondary endpoints reported here are on pain, HRQOL, symptomatic skeletal-related events, and time to first opiate use for cancer-related pain in cohort A. Pain was assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, and HRQOL was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P). All endpoints were analysed in patients in cohort A by modified intention-to-treat. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02987543.  Findings:   Between Feb 6, 2017, and June 4, 2019, 245 patients were enrolled in cohort A and received study treatment (162 [66%] in the olaparib group and 83 [34%] in the control group). Median duration of follow-up at data cutoff in all patients was 6·2 months (IQR 2·2-10·4) for the olaparib group and 3·5 months (1·7-4·9) for the control group. In cohort A, median time to pain progression was significantly longer with olaparib than with control (median not reached [95% CI not reached-not reached] with olaparib vs 9·92 months [5·39-not reached] with control; HR 0·44 [95% CI 0·22-0·91]; p=0·019). Pain interference scores were also better in the olaparib group (difference in overall adjusted mean change from baseline score -0·85 [95% CI -1·31 to -0·39]; pnominal=0·0004). Median time to progression of pain severity was not reached in either group (95% CI not reached-not reached for both groups; HR 0·56 [95% CI 0·25-1·34]; pnominal=0·17). In patients who had not used opiates at baseline (113 in the olaparib group, 58 in the control group), median time to first opiate use for cancer-related pain was 18·0 months (95% CI 12·8-not reached) in the olaparib group versus 7·5 months (3·2-not reached) in the control group (HR 0·61; 95% CI 0·38-0·99; pnominal=0·044). The proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in FACT-P total score during treatment was higher for the olaparib group than the control group: 15 (10%) of 152 evaluable patients had a response in the olaparib group compared with one (1%) of evaluable 77 patients in the control group (odds ratio 8·32 [95% CI 1·64-151·84]; pnominal=0·0065).

Our understanding of the natural history of prostate cancer in testicular cancer survivors is very limited due to its rare incidence.  Methods:   Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Registry from 1978 to 2011, we identified 282 TCS with subsequent prostate cancer and examined the tumor grade and clinical outcomes in contrast to men with primary prostate cancer in the general population.  Results:   TCS with a subsequent prostate cancer diagnosis were more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age than men with primary prostate cancer (65.2% vs. 37.6% for age ≤65, 34.8% vs. 62.4% for age >65, p<0.001) and were more likely to have grade III/IV tumors (46.2% vs. 37.0%, p<0.002). Longer latency between testicular and prostate cancer diagnoses was associated with a higher risk of grade III/IV (p<0.001) cancer. Despite the increased risk for high-grade tumors, 10-year prostate cancer-specific survival and overall survival were not significantly different between TCS and men with primary prostate cancer. Based on the available information in SEER, we found that prior history of radiotherapy for testicular cancer had no impact on tumor grade or survival outcomes.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer in TCS was more likely to be diagnosed at a younger age and with higher grades. Risks of grade III/IV disease increased with longer latency between testicular and prostate cancer diagnoses. Radiotherapy for testicular cancer did not appear to have a significant impact on the outcome of subsequent prostate cancer.""","""['Hong Zhang', 'Hongmei Yang', 'Sanjukta Bandyopadhyay', 'Michael T Milano', 'Chunkit Fung', 'Edward M Messing', 'Yuhchyau Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Risk of second primary tumors in men diagnosed with prostate cancer: a population-based cohort study.', 'Prostate cancer in Pennsylvania: The role of older age at diagnosis, aggressiveness, and environmental risk factors on treatment and mortality using data from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry.', 'Might men diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer benefit from definitive treatment of the primary tumor?

To examine the extent and impact of these modifications on oncology service disruptions in Nigeria, we surveyed oncology patients across selected public and private cancer treatment centers.  Materials and methods:   Participating in the study were 15 tertiary cancer treatment centers across 12 Nigerian states. We recruited adult patients with cancer (18+ years) on active treatment to complete a self-administered survey on cancer care during COVID-19. We conducted descriptive and multivariate data analysis using Stata 16.1.  Results:   Respondents were (n = 1,072), female (65.7%), ages 18-49 years (50.3%), and married (80.7%). The top two cancers were breast and prostate. Overall, 17.3% of respondents reported disruptions to cancer care, and more than half (51.0%) reported difficulties accessing care. Changes in chemotherapy regimens or route of administration were reported in 8.4% of respondents. Odds for any disruption were highest for older patients, western states, patients with prostate cancer, and patients with two or more flu symptoms. Odds for radiotherapy cancellation were highest for older patients, those with prostate cancer, and those with medium service perception.  Conclusion:   This study investigated COVID-19-influenced cancer treatment disruptions in Nigeria. Patients with cancer experienced significant disruptions to cancer care. Vulnerable patients are most likely to be negatively affected. Policies and strategies aimed at minimizing service disruptions while maintaining cancer patients' safety should be a priority for all health care institutions in the COVID-19 era.""","""['Adedayo Joseph', 'Bankole Olatosi', 'Mohammad Rifat Haider', 'Bolanle C Adegboyega', 'Nwamaka N Lasebikan', 'Usman M Aliyu', 'Musa Ali-Gombe', 'Mutiu A Jimoh', 'Olusegun Abayomi Biyi-Olutunde', 'Opeyemi Awofeso', 'Omolara Aminat Fatiregun', 'Evaristus Oseiwe Oboh', 'Emmanuella Nwachukwu', 'Ismail H Zubairu', 'Samuel A Otene', 'Oluwatoyin I Iyare', 'Temitope Andero', 'Alabi Babatunde Musbau', 'Azeezat Ajose', 'Adedayo A Onitilo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JCO Glob Oncol""","""['Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on provision of sexual and reproductive health services in primary health facilities in Nigeria: a cross-sectional study.', 'Global effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on paediatric cancer care: a cross-sectional study.', 'Public perception of COVID-19 management and response in Nigeria: a cross-sectional survey.', 'Impact of the early phase of the COVID pandemic on cancer treatment delivery and the quality of cancer care: a scoping review and conceptual model.', 'A Practical Approach to the Management of Cancer Patients During the Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic: An International Collaborative Group.', 'COVID-19 impacts on healthcare access in sub-Saharan Africa: an overview.', 'Impact of COVID-19 on delivery of oncology services in Northern Tanzania: a cross-sectional study of community health workers and patients undergoing cancer treatment at the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre.', 'Cancer service delivery and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa: a scoping review.']"""

Two proof-of-principle studies have proposed alternative grading schemes based on percentage Gleason pattern 4/5 (integrated quantitative Gleason score; IQ-Gleason) and IC/IDC presence (cribriform grade; cGrade). Our objective was to compare the performance of GG, IQ-Gleason and cGrade for predicting biochemical recurrence and metastasis after radical prostatectomy (RP). RP specimens of 1064 patients were pathologically reviewed and graded according to the three schemes. Discriminative power for prediction of biochemical recurrence-free (BCRFS) and metastasis-free (MFS) survival was compared using Harrell's c-index. The GG distribution at RP was 207 (19.4%) GG1, 472 (44.4%) GG2, 126 (11.8%) GG3, 140 (13.2%) GG4 and 119 (11.2%) GG5.

The results showed that Ezrin expression was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and 22RV1 and PC-3 cell samples. The overexpression of Ezrin promoted the migratory and invasive abilities of 22RV1 and PC-3 cells. Finally, the clinical data revealed that the expression of Ezrin in CTCs of PCa patients was significantly upregulated with the metastatic degree.

STIL has been found disordered in multiple cancers and driven carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of STIL in cancers remain ambiguous. Here, we systematically analyzed the genetic alterations, molecular mechanisms, and clinical relevance of STIL across >10,000 samples representing 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We found that STIL expression is up-regulated in most cancer types compared with their adjacent normal tissues. The expression dysregulation of STIL was affected by copy number variation, mutation, and DNA methylation. High STIL expression was associated with worse outcomes and promoted the progression of cancers. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) further revealed that STIL is involved in cell cycle progression, Mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets pathways across cancer types. STIL expression was negatively correlated with multiple genes taking part in ciliogenesis and was positively correlated with several genes which participated with centrosomal duplication or cilia degradation. Moreover, STIL silencing could promote primary cilia formation and inhibit cell cycle protein expression in prostate and kidney cancer cell lines. The phenotype and protein expression alteration due to STIL silencing could be reversed by IFT88 silencing in cancer cells. These results revealed that STIL could regulate the cell cycle through primary cilia in tumor cells. In summary, our results revealed the importance of STIL in cancers.

In this study, we first established a novel nomogram to predict PCA progression based on circadian clock (CIC)-related genes and provided insights into the tumor immune microenvironment.  Methods:   The TCGA and Genecards databases were used to identify potential candidate genes. Lasso and Cox regression analyses were applied to develop a CIC-related gene signature. The tumor immune microenvironment was evaluated through appropriate statistical methods and the GSCALite database.  Results:   Ten genes were identified to construct a gene signature to predict progression probability for patients with PCA. Patients with high-risk scores were more prone to progress than those with low-risk scores (hazard ratio (HR): 4.11, 95% CI: 2.66-6.37; risk score cut-off: 1.194). CLOCK, PER (1, 2, 3), CRY2, NPAS2, RORA, and ARNTL showed a higher correlation with anti-oncogenes, while CSNK1D and CSNK1E presented a greater relationship with oncogenes. Overall, patients with higher risk scores showed lower mRNA expression of PER1, PER2, and CRY2 and higher expression of CSNK1E. In general, tumor samples presented higher infiltration levels of macrophages, T cells and myeloid dendritic cells than normal samples. In addition, tumor samples had higher immune scores, lower stroma scores and lower microenvironment scores than normal samples. Notably, patients with higher risk scores were associated with significantly lower levels of neutrophils, NK cells, T helper type 1, and mast cells. There was a positive correlation between the risk score and the tumor mutation burden (TMB) score, and patients with higher TMB scores were more prone to progress than those with lower TMB scores. Likewise, we observed similar results regarding the correlation between the microsatellite instability (MSI) score and the risk score and the impact of the MSI score on the progression-free interval. We observed that anti-oncogenes presented a significantly positive correlation with PD-L1, PD-L2, TIGIT and SIGLEC15, especially PD-L2.

Conclusion:   We present the first study evaluating inter-fraction changes to the PB during MR-guided RT.

Graphene oxide (GO) nanostructures have the capacity for DOX delivery while promoting its cytotoxicity in cancer.  Areas covered:   The favorable characteristics of GO nanocomposites, preparation method, and application in cancer therapy are described. Then, DOX resistance in cancer, GO-mediated photothermal therapy, and DOX delivery for cancer suppression are described. Preparation of stimuli-responsive GO nanocomposites, surface functionalization, hybrid nanoparticles, and theranostic applications are emphasized in DOX chemotherapy.  Expert opinion:   GO nanoparticle-based photothermal therapy maximizes the anti-cancer activity of DOX against cancer cells. Besides DOX delivery, GO nanomaterials are capable of loading anti-cancer agents and genetic tools to minimize drug resistance and enhance the cytolytic impact of DOX in cancer eradication. To enhance DOX accumulation, stimuli-responsive (redox-, light-, enzyme- and pH-sensitive) GO nanoparticles have been developed for DOX delivery. Development of targeted delivery of DOX-loaded GO nanomaterials against cancer cells may be achieved by surface modification of polymers such as polyethylene glycol, hyaluronic acid, and chitosan. DOX-loaded GO nanoparticles have demonstrated theranostic potential.

A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis on 362 Patients Undergoing Surgery at a Referral Center""","""Introduction: Active surveillance (AS) is a treatment strategy for low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients, with extended indication to some intermediate-risk PCa. However, active treatment is necessary in case of disease progression and robotic radical prostatectomy (RALP) is one of the treatment modalities. The aim of the study is to compare outcomes of a delayed RALP after an initial heterogeneous surveillance strategy with those of immediate RALP in a single referral center. Methods: Data from patients who underwent RALP after initial assumed ""active surveillance"" (referred from different institutions and backgrounds) were compared to those of patients who underwent an immediate RALP after propensity score (PS) matching. The PS analysis was performed matching ISUP score at the time of entering surveillance with ISUP at RALP for the control group; other matching covariates at the time of surgery were considered (including age, prostate-specific antigen, body mass index, prostate size, cT, pre-op Sexual Health Inventory for Men, etc.). Perioperative, functional, and oncological outcomes were compared between groups. Results: Three hundred sixty-two RALP patients were included (181 after surveillance and 181 immediate RALP). Patients after surveillance had a worse pT and ISUP score (p < 0.001); LVI and EPE were higher in the surveilled group (13% vs. 5%, p = 0.001; 38% vs. 22%, p = 0.001), without significant difference in positive surgical margin. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) was significantly higher for delayed RALP (hazard ratio: 4.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.4-12; p = 0.013), whereas potency and continence rate did not differ significantly. Conclusions: At a referral center receiving patients from diverse backgrounds, outcomes of RALP after heterogeneous surveillance strategies are variable and less predictable, maybe attributable to different protocols and surgical planning. The higher BCR rate in a high-risk surveilled cohort may suggest an increased burden of cancer-related care for RALP patients after surveillance.""","""['Bernardo Rocco', 'Maria Chiara Sighinolfi', 'Marcio Covas Moscovas', 'Marco Sandri', 'Simone Assumma', 'Giorgio Bozzini', 'Salvatore Micali', 'Seetharam Bath', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Retzius-sparing versus standard robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Modified Apical Dissection and Lateral Prostatic Fascia Preservation Improves Early Postoperative Functional Recovery in Robotic-assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Propensity Score-matched Analysis.', 'Benchmarks for operative outcomes of robotic and open radical prostatectomy: results from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.', 'Positive surgical margin and perioperative complication rates of primary surgical treatments for prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing retropubic, laparoscopic, and robotic prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

Physical simulation training can provide a structured approach to this training but only if suitably challenging training simulators exist. This study describes the design and preliminary evaluation of a simulation-based transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging training workshop developed for medical physicists involved in low-dose-rate (LDR) prostate brachytherapy (PBT).  Methods:   The study incorporated novel high-fidelity anthropomorphic PBT TRUS training simulators and a TRUS imaging module with a blended-learning pedagogical approach, to address TRUS image optimisation and managing image quality.  Results:   Results demonstrated a significant improvement in knowledge, with an average increase in multiple choice question score of 61% (P < 0.0002), and that there was a 46% (P < 0.0001) average increase in the participants perceived understanding of TRUS scanner operation, and an increase of 36% (P < 0.001) in participants readiness to optimise image quality and mitigate image artefacts. Focus group data explored participants' experiences, perceptions and challenges with TRUS LDR PBT.  Conclusions:   This study suggests a benefit in offering a simulation training workshop to medical physicists and the potential benefit to other healthcare professionals involved in prostate brachytherapy, by incorporating novel high-fidelity anthropomorphic PBT TRUS training simulators, in a simulated environment to practice ultrasound image optimisation for PBT image guidance.

Methods:   From 2004 to 2015, 430,347 patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer were identified in the National Cancer Database. Radiation case volume (RCV) of each hospital was calculated based on number of patients treated. After excluding certain patients including those with metastatic disease, our final analysis population included 116,091 intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients receiving radiation therapy or radiation with androgen deprivation therapy. Characteristics analyzed include age, race, distance to treatment facility, Charlson-Deyo Score, and socioeconomic factors. Primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Five-year survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Adjusted hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were computed using multivariate analysis. Cox regression and propensity score-matched analysis was performed.  Results:   Median follow up was 63.5 months and estimated 5-year OS was 90.1% at high RCV centers and 88.2% at low RCV centers (P <.0001). Treatment at high RCV facility was associated with significantly lower mortality compared to treatment at a low RCV facility on multivariate analysis and propensity score matching analysis. The survival benefit of treatment at a high RCV facility remained when high RCV facilities were defined as those above the 80th, 90th, and 95th percentile in patient volume (P <.05).  Conclusion:   Treatment at a high radiation case volume facility is associated with improved OS in patients with radiation-treated intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

We hypothesized that LE will be affected by race/ethnicity.  Patients and methods:   We relied on the 2004-2006 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk PCa patients treated with either RP or EBRT. SSA life tables were used to compute 10-year LE predictions and were compared to OS. Stratification was performed according to treatment type (RP/EBRT) and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian).  Results:   Of 55,383 assessable patients, 40,490 were non-Hispanic White (RP 49.3% vs. EBRT 50.7%), 7194 non-Hispanic Black (RP 41.3% vs. EBRT 50.7%), 4716 Hispanic/Latino (RP 51.0% vs. EBRT 49.0%) and 2983 were Asian (RP 41.6% vs. EBRT 58.4%). In both RP and EBRT patients, OS exceeded life tables' LE predictions, except for non-Hispanic Blacks. However, in RP patients, the magnitude of the difference was greater than in EBRT. Moreover, in RP patients, OS of non-Hispanic Blacks virtually perfectly followed predicted LE. Conversely, in EBRT patients, the OS of non-Hispanic Black patients was worse than predicted LE.  Conclusions:   When comparing SEER-derived observed OS with SSA life table-derived predicted life expectancy, we recorded a survival disadvantage in non-Hispanic Black RP and EBRT patients, which was not the case in the three other races/ethnicities (non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic/Latinos, and Asians).

This paper investigates several techniques for analyzing data from DWI acquired at a range of b-values for the purpose of detecting prostate cancer.

Accordingly, we evaluated the benign/malignant tissue classification potential of several parametric maps produced using different combinations of b-values and fitting models. In the second phase, we utilized the maps that performed best in the first phase of experiments to design a machine learning-based computer-assisted diagnosis system for the detection of early stage prostate cancer. The system performance was cross-validated using data from 20 patients. On a fivefold cross-validation scheme, a maximum accuracy and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 90% and 0.978, respectively, was achieved by a system that uses ADC maps fitted using the mono-exponential model at 11 different b-values.

Our goal was to document and compare lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) among men who underwent SBRT with and without SpaceOAR hydrogel (Augmenix, Inc., Bedford, MA).  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 87 men (50 SpaceOAR and 37 non-SpaceOAR) who underwent SBRT. Primary outcomes were patient reported symptoms during radiation therapy, pharmacotherapy usage, and urologic and bowel survey scores up to 6-months post-SBRT.  Results:   78% of men were on α-inhibitors at the end of SBRT, an increase from 27.6% baseline usage (p < 0.001). Post-SBRT urinary frequency was more common in the non-SpaceOAR group versus the SpaceOAR group (68% versus 38%, p = 0.006), as was nocturia (35% vs. 8%, p = 0.002). Acute gastrointestinal symptoms did not differ. 58.8% of men were on α-inhibitors at 6-months of follow-up post-SBRT, an increase from 27.6% baseline usage (p < 0.001). Importantly, there was a difference of α-inhibitor use between non-SpaceOAR and SpaceOAR groups at the end of SBRT and at 1.5-, 3-, and 6-months follow up (86% vs. 53% [p = 0.002], 83% vs. 53% [p = 0.005], 72% vs. 49% [p = 0.038], respectively).  Conclusion:   LUTS after SBRT remains a significant problem for men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. LUTS affects men during and up to 6-months following SBRT.

Knockout of the Skp2 gene blocks pRb/p53 doubly deficient prostate cancer in mice, which inspired the authors to develop an approach for delivering siRNA that would efficiently silence Skp2 (siSkp2) in vivo. Here, a facile strategy is reported to directly assemble siSkp2 with the natural compound quercetin (Que) into supramolecular nanoparticles (NPs). This carrier-free siSkp2 delivery system could effectively protect siSkp2 from degradation in serum and enhance its cellular internalization. Furthermore, the siSkp2/Que NPs exhibit synergistic effects in Skp2 silencing, because they can degrade the mRNA and protein of Skp2 simultaneously. Indeed, siSkp2/Que NPs remarkably diminish the Skp2 abundance and further inhibit the proliferation and migration of TMU cells (RB1/TP53/KRAS triple mutations) in vitro. The in vivo results further show that i.v. administration of siSkp2/Que NPs efficiently accumulates in tumor sites and strongly inhibits the growth of TMU tumors in nude mice. Importantly, the siSkp2/Que NPs do not induce any abnormality in the treated mice, which suggests satisfactory biocompatibility.

The current study explored the underlying molecular mechanisms of CDK8/CDK19 and tested effects of novel CDK8/CDK19 inhibitors. PC3, DU145, LNCaP, and androgen-independent LNCaP Abl were used for in vitro experiments. Two inhibitors and CDK19 overexpression were used to modify CDK8/CDK19 activity. MTT assay, propidium iodide staining, wound healing assay, Boyden chamber assay, and adhesion assay were used to investigate cell viability, cell cycle, migration, and adhesion, respectively. Peptide-kinase screen using the PamGene platform was conducted to identify phosphorylated targets. Combining CDK8/CDK19 inhibitors with anti-androgens led to synergistic antiproliferative effects and sensitized androgen-independent cells to bicalutamide. CDK8/CDK19 inhibition resulted in reduced migration and increased collagen I-dependent adhesion. Phosphorylation of multiple peptides linked to cancer progression was identified to be dependent on CDK8/CDK19.

A few recent studies have reported that manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) can effectively modulate EMT phenotype by influencing cellular redox environment via altering the intracellular ratio between O2- and H2O2. Daidzin (DDZ), a naturally occurring isoflavone isolated from Pueraria lobate (Fabaceae), has numerous pharmacologic effects including anti-cholesterol, anti-angiocardiopathy, anti-cancer. However, the potential inhibitory impact of DDZ on cancer metastasis and specifically on the EMT process has not been evaluated. We aimed to evaluate the possible relationship between MnSOD and EMT as well as influence of DDZ on these two processes in colon and prostate carcinoma cells.  Main methods:   Cell viability was measured by MTT and real time cell analysis (RTCA) assay. Protein expression level of EMT markers and Akt/mTOR/PI3K signaling pathway were evaluated by Western blot analysis. Expression of EMT markers in cells was observed by immunocytochemistry. Cell invasion and migrations were evaluated by wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay.  Key findings:   DDZ can block EMT accompanied with down-regulation of MnSOD, fibronectin, vimentin, MMP-9, MMP-2, N-cadherin, twist, and Snail, and up-regulation of occludin and E-cadherin in both unstimulated and TGFβ-induced cells. In addition, DDZ exposure also attenuated cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis by reversing the EMT process in SNU-C2A, DU145, and PC-3 cells. DDZ treatment also modulated activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascades in DU145 cells. Moreover, an overexpression of MnSOD or silencing of MnSOD expression modulated EMT-related proteins, PI3K/Akt/mTOR activation and invasive activity.  Significance:   This is first finding on the DDZ in regulating MnSOD and EMT process by targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in both colorectal and prostate cancer cell lines. Our data indicated that DDZ might act as a potent suppressor of EMT by affecting MnSOD expression in tumor cells.""","""['Min Hee Yang', 'Sang Hoon Jung', 'Jae-Young Um', 'Alan Prem Kumar', 'Gautam Sethi', 'Kwang Seok Ahn']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Potential function of oxymatrine as a novel suppressor of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in lung tumor cells.', 'Ginkgolic Acid Inhibits Invasion and Migration and TGF-β-Induced EMT of Lung Cancer Cells Through PI3K/Akt/mTOR Inactivation.', 'Inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway alleviates ovarian cancer chemoresistance through reversing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and decreasing cancer stem cell marker expression.', 'Role of AKT and mTOR signaling pathways in the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process.', 'PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in cancer stem cells.', 'The Role of Natural Flavonoids as Telomerase Inhibitors in Suppressing Cancer Growth.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.', 'Procaine Abrogates the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Process through Modulating c-Met Phosphorylation in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Potential Application of Leelamine as a Novel Regulator of Chemokine-Induced Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer Cells.']"""

Current PSA test results guidelines in our population are informed by reference intervals derived from studies from Caucasians and other racial groups. With scanty data on PSA reference values from our local population, this study evaluated the serum PSA levels of apparently healthy Nigerian male subjects in whom prostate cancer and urinary tract infection have been excluded.  Method:   This study had participants aged 40 to 70 years, with no lower urinary tract symptoms or other symptoms suggestive of prostate disease recruited from the male staff population of the University of Abuja and University of Abuja Teaching Hospital and the adjoining local community. They were physically examined, had prostate ultrasonography, urine analysis, and blood sample collected for PSA testing. Data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 24.  Result:   Of a total of 210 men who participated in the study, 191 eventually met the inclusion criteria. The average age was 52.9 years, ninety seven percent of them had heard of prostate cancer before now. The mean total PSA was 1.46 ng/mL (SD +/-1.55), while the reference interval was .23-5.60 ng/mL. The average prostate size was 41.8 mL (SD+/-20.11), and there was a positive correlation between the PSA and the prostate size (.418) as well as the age of the subjects (.446). There was no significant difference in the mean PSA value for those with or without family history of prostate cancer (P=.979).  Conclusion:   The reference range of PSA in Nigeria is higher than in other races, hence utilizing a local value in decision making would help to reduce unnecessary invasive procedures.""","""['Oseremen I Aisuodionoe-Shadrach', 'Sefiu B Eniola', 'Maxwell M Nwegbu', 'Hadijat O Kolade-Yunusa', 'Oriaku O Okereke', 'Thairu Yunusa']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Control""","""['Serum prostate-specific antigen in a community-based population of healthy men.

Methods:   PI-QUAL scores were independently recorded by three radiologists (two senior, one junior). Readers also recorded whether MRI was sufficient to rule-in/out cancer and if repeat imaging was required. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using Cohen's κ. PI-QUAL scores were further correlated to PI-RADS score, number of biopsy procedures, and need for repeat imaging.  Results:   Image quality was sufficient (≥PI-QUAL-3) in 237/247 (96%) and optimal (≥PI-QUAL-4) in 206/247 (83%) of males undergoing 3T-MRI. Overall PI-QUAL scores showed moderate inter-reader agreement for senior (K = 0.51) and junior-senior readers (K = 0.47), with DCE showing highest agreement (K = 0.47). With PI-QUAL-5 studies, the negative MRI calls increased from 50 to 87% and indeterminate PI-RADS-3 rates decreased from 31.8. to 10.4% compared to lower quality PI-QUAL-3 studies. More patients with PI-QUAL scores 1-3 underwent biopsy for negative (47%) and indeterminate probability (100%) MRIs compared to PI-QUAL score 4-5 (30 and 75%, respectively). Ability to rule-in cancer increased with PI-QUAL score, from 50% at PI-QUAL 1-2 to 90% for PI-QUAL 4-5, with a similarly, but greater effect for ruling-out cancer and at a lower threshold, from 0% for scans of PI-QUAL 1-2 to 67.1% for PI-QUAL 4 and 100% for PI-QUAL-5.  Conclusion:   Higher PI-QUAL scores for image quality are associated with decreased uncertainty in MRI decision-making and improved efficiency of diagnostic pathway delivery.

Loss of RNASEH2B confers cancer cells sensitivity to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition due to impaired ribonucleotide excision repair and PARP trapping. When co-deleted with RB1, however, cells lose their sensitivity, in part, through E2F1-induced BRCA2 expression, thereby enhancing homologous recombination repair capacity. Nevertheless, loss of BRCA2 resensitizes RNASEH2B/RB1 co-deleted cells to PARP inhibition. Our results may explain some of the disparate clinical results from PARP inhibition due to interaction between multiple genomic alterations and support a comprehensive genomic test to determine who may benefit from PARP inhibition.

However, developing new ELISAs with high detection sensitivity and broad detection dynamic ranges without resorting to complicated signal processing and equipment setups remains a challenge. In this work, we report a strategy to simultaneously improve the detection sensitivity and broaden the dynamic range by replacing the chromogenic reagents used in traditional ELISAs with an aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen). The developed AIE-ELISA could generate complementary absorbance and fluorescence signals with a linear detection range of 1.6-25,000 pg/mL. The application of this dual-mode AIE-ELISA in the detection of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) realized a limit of detection of 1.3 pg/mL (3.78 × 10-14 M) and dynamic range improvement of approximately 2 orders of magnitude compared to a single-mode ELISA, which enabled it to discriminate a minor PSA difference in a patient's serum.

HC worsens transplant outcomes and patient wellbeing in terms of pain, hospitalization, and need for supportive care. A deeper understanding of the risk factors of HC may lead to more intensive prevention in high-risk patients.  Methods:   In this report, we analyzed 237 consecutive patients who received HSCT with the aim of identifying possible risk factors for HC and their consequences, with a particular focus on transplant- and gender-related risk factors.  Results:   HC occurred in 17% of patients, with a higher incidence in males (21% vs 11%, p = 0.03). Risk factors identified for HC included age over 55 years, male recipient, HLA mismatch, reduced intensity conditioning, and cyclophosphamide-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Increased HC was seen in patients with grade II-IV acute GVHD and detectable BKV and JCV viruria. In a multivariate model, increased age remained significant (p = 0.013). Patients with HC had longer hospitalizations and increased non-relapse mortality (NRM). Among male recipients, independent risk factors for HC included age (p = 0.016) and prostate volume (p = 0.016). Prostatic hyperplasia (volume more than 40 cm3) occurred in 33% of male patients, of which 32% developed HC (compared with 16% of patients without prostatic hyperplasia; p = 0.032).  Conclusions:   Age is the most important risk factor for HC. Additional potential risk factors include cyclophosphamide-based GVHD prophylaxis and HLA mismatch. Among male recipients, prostatic hyperplasia is an additional independent risk factor. As HC is common and associated with prolonged hospitalization, more intensive prophylactic strategies should be considered in high-risk patients.""","""['Eugenio Galli', 'Federica Sorà', 'Luca Di Gianfrancesco', 'Sabrina Giammarco', 'Elisabetta Metafuni', 'Maria Assunta Limongiello', 'Idanna Innocenti', 'Francesco Autore', 'Luca Laurenti', 'Patrizia Chiusolo', 'Andrea Bacigalupo', 'Simona Sica']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Hemorrhagic cystitis after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: risk factors, graft source and survival.', 'BK Virus Infections and Hemorrhagic Cystitis in Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Recipients.', 'Hemorrhagic cystitis following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: incidence, risk factors and association with CMV reactivation and graft-versus-host disease.', 'A Clinical Review of the Different Strategies to Minimize Hemorrhagic Cystitis Associated with the Use of Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide in an Allogeneic Transplant.', 'Full myeloablative conditioning and an unrelated HLA mismatched donor increase the risk for BK virus-positive hemorrhagic cystitis in allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplanted patients.']"""

Our early experience has identified several procedure refinements, and aligns with early evidence from prospective clinical studies using transurethral ultrasound ablation for treatment of patients with either primary or recurrent disease.

Whether a combination of darolutamide, androgen-deprivation therapy, and docetaxel would increase survival among patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer is unknown.  Methods:   In this international, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in a 1:1 ratio to receive darolutamide (at a dose of 600 mg [two 300-mg tablets] twice daily) or matching placebo, both in combination with androgen-deprivation therapy and docetaxel. The primary end point was overall survival.  Results:   The primary analysis involved 1306 patients (651 in the darolutamide group and 655 in the placebo group); 86.1% of the patients had disease that was metastatic at the time of the initial diagnosis. At the data cutoff date for the primary analysis (October 25, 2021), the risk of death was significantly lower, by 32.5%, in the darolutamide group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.68; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.80; P<0.001). Darolutamide was also associated with consistent benefits with respect to the secondary end points and prespecified subgroups. Adverse events were similar in the two groups, and the incidences of the most common adverse events (occurring in ≥10% of the patients) were highest during the overlapping docetaxel treatment period in both groups.

Materials and methods:   The ERASE (Exercise during Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer) Trial randomized 52 patients with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance to high-intensity interval training (HIIT, 26 patients) or usual care (UC, 26 patients). The HIIT group performed a 12-week, thrice weekly, supervised, aerobic HIIT program. The UC group did not exercise. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline and after intervention, including prostate cancer-specific anxiety (Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer), fear of cancer progression (Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory), prostate cancer symptoms (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite), quality of life (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core) and psychological health outcomes (eg fatigue, stress and self-esteem). Analysis of covariance was used to compare between-group differences.  Results:   Fifty of 52 participants (96%) completed patient-reported outcome assessments at 12 weeks. Adherence to HIIT was 96%. Compared to UC, HIIT significantly improved total prostate cancer-specific anxiety (adjusted between-group mean difference -2.7, 95% confidence interval, range -5.0 to -0.4, p=0.024), as well as the fear of progression subscale (p=0.013), hormonal symptoms (p=0.005), perceived stress (p=0.037), fatigue (p=0.029) and self-esteem (p=0.007).  Conclusions:   A 12-week supervised HIIT program may improve prostate cancer-specific anxiety, fear of cancer progression, hormone symptoms, stress, fatigue and self-esteem in men with prostate cancer on active surveillance.

Students discussed their personal experiences with cancer and their thoughts on the causes of and potential solutions to Appalachian Kentucky's cancer disparities. Content analysis was used to identify common themes, subthemes, and subtopics in the essays regarding cancer types, causes of cancer in Appalachia, and solutions to the high cancer rates. Common cancer types experienced by the students included breast, lung, and prostate. The most frequently identified themes that drive cancer rates in Appalachian Kentucky were identified as geography, environmental factors, tobacco use, education, poverty, prevention, and mistrust. Common proposed solutions to decrease cancer rates were to increase education and awareness, screening, and tobacco cessation.

Different predictive models have already been used either for initial stratification of PC patients or to predict disease recurrence. Recently, artificial intelligence has been introduced in the diagnosis and management of PC with a potential to revolutionize this field. The aim of this study was to analyze machine learning (ML) classifiers in order to predict disease progression in the moment of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) elevation during follow-up. The study cohort consisted of 109 PC patients treated with external beam radiotherapy alone or in combination with androgen deprivation therapy. We developed and evaluated the performance of two ML algorithms based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and naïve Bayes (NB). Of all patients, 72.5% was randomly selected for a training set while the remaining patients were used for testing of the models. The presence/absence of disease progression was defined as the output variable. The input variables for models were conducted from the univariate analysis preformed among two groups of patients in the training set. They included two pretreatment variables (UICC stage and Gleason's score risk group) and five posttreatment variables (nadir PSA, time to nadir PSA, PSA doubling time, PSA velocity, and PSA in the moment of disease reevaluation). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive accuracy was calculated to test the models' performance. The results showed that specificity was similar for both models, while NB achieved better sensitivity then ANN (100.0% versus 94.4%). The ANN showed an accuracy of 93.3%, and the matching for NB model was 96.7%.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of NaBu on cell cycle control, apoptosis, and expression of some lncRNAs in two human prostate cancer cells (PC-3 and LNCAP). Cell viability was assessed and the appropriate dose was determined using the MTT assay. Real-time PCR technique was also used to evaluate the expression levels of HULC, FOXCUT, and CCAT2 lncRNAs. Apoptosis was diagnosed using annexin V staining, and cell cycle distribution was then assessed using flow cytometry with propidium iodide DNA staining. NaBu induced apoptosis in both prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. The expressions of CCAT2 and HULC lncRNAs genes have significantly decreased in the presence of NaBu (P <0.05) in both PC3 and LNCAP cell lines, in comparison with the control. However, no significant difference was observed in the expression of FOXCUT lncRNAs. Moreover, the results of flow cytometry showed an increase in cell cycle arrest of LNCAP cell line at the sub-G1 stage as compared to the control cells, but no significant difference was observed between the control cells and NaBu-exposed PC-3 cells. In addition, the percentages of early and late apoptotic cells following treatment with NaBu were 80% and 49.63% in LNCAP and PC-3 cells, respectively.

Our present study was conducted to discover the possible drug target and curative mechanism of luteolin to serve as treatment for PC and COVID-19. The differential gene expression of PC cases was determined via RNA sequencing. The application of network pharmacology and molecular docking aimed to exhibit the drug targets and pharmacological mechanisms of luteolin. In this study, we found the top 20 up- and downregulated gene expressions in PC patients. Enrichment data demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects, where improvement of metabolism and enhancement of immunity were the main functions and mechanism of luteolin in treating PC and COVID-19, characterized by associated signaling pathways.

In turn, this induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), activates tumor cell movements through exaggerated mitochondrial dynamics, and promotes metastatic dissemination in vivo. In a small-molecule drug screen, compensatory activation of stress response (GCN2) and survival (Akt) signaling maintains the viability of Mic60-low tumors and provides a selective therapeutic vulnerability.

Here, we report on treatment outcome and survival using this novel treatment modality in a series of 53 patients with mCRPC directly after their androgen deprivation treatment (ADT). Methods: 225Ac-PSMA-617 was administered to 53 such patients. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was obtained at baseline, before every treatment cycle, and on follow-up to select patients for treatment, determine the activity to be administered, and assess their response. Serial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurements were obtained for response assessment. Results: The median age of the patients was 63.4 y (range, 45-83 y). In total, 167 cycles were administered (median, 3; range, 1-7). Forty-eight patients (91%) had a PSA decline of at least 50%, and 51 patients (96%) had any decline in PSA. 68Ga-PSMA PET findings became negative in 30 patients. In the multivariate analysis, a PSA decline of at least 50% proved predictive of both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and platelet count also proved predictive for PFS. The median estimated OS was 9 mo for patients with a PSA decline of less than 50% but was not yet reached at the latest follow-up (55 mo) for patients with a PSA decline of 50% or more. The estimated median PFS was 22 mo for patients with a PSA decline of at least 50% and 4 mo for patients with a PSA decline of less than 50%. No severe hematotoxicity was noted, and only 3 patients had grade III-IV nephrotoxicity. The commonest toxicity seen was grade I-II xerostomia, observed in 81% of patients. Conclusion: In 91% of 53 patients with mCRPC, treatment with 225Ac-PSMA-617 immediately after ADT resulted in at least a 50% decrease in PSA level. Furthermore, a PSA decline of at least 50% proved the single most important factor predicting PFS and OS after 225Ac-PSMA-617 treatment. Of interest, median OS in patients with a PSA decline of at least 50% was not yet reached at the latest follow-up (55 mo).

High expression of neurotensin receptor subtype 1 (NTR1) is associated with neuroendocrine differentiation of PCa, which makes NTR1 a potential target for neuroendocrine PCa. In this study, the NTR1-targeted tracer 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 was synthesized, and its affinity to androgen-dependent (LNCap) and androgen-independent (PC3) xenografts was determined. Methods: 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 was labeled using an automated synthesizer module, and its stability, labeling yield, and radiochemical purity were analyzed by radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. Receptor binding affinity was evaluated in NTR1-positive PC3 cells by a competitive binding assay. The biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 in vivo was evaluated in PC3 and LNCap xenografts by small-animal PET imaging. NTR1 expression was identified by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence evaluation. Results: 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 was synthesized successfully, with a yield of 88.07% ± 1.26%, radiochemical purity of at least 99%, and favorable stability. The NTR1 affinity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) for 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 was 7.59 ± 0.41 nM. Small-animal PET/CT of PC3 xenograft animals showed high-contrast images with intense tumor uptake, which revealed specific NTR1 expression. The tumors showed significant radioactivity (4.95 ± 0.67 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue [%ID/g]) at 1 h, which fell to 1.95 ± 0.17 %ID/g (P < 0.01, t = 8.72) after specific blockage by neurotensin. LNCap xenografts had no significant accumulation (0.81 ± 0.06 %ID/g) of 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 at 1 h. In contrast, 68Ga-PSMA-11 was concentrated mainly in LNCap xenografts (8.60 ± 2.11 %ID/g), with no significant uptake in PC3 tumors (0.53 ± 0.05 %ID/g), consistent with the in vitro immunohistochemistry findings. Biodistribution evaluation showed rapid clearance from the blood and main organs (brain, heart, lung, liver, muscle, and bone), with significantly high tumor-to-liver (4.41 ± 0.73) and tumor-to-muscle (12.34 ± 1.32) ratios at 60 min after injection.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying PD-L1 overexpression in tumours have yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we describe that RelB participates in the immune evasion of prostate cancer (PCa) via cis/trans transcriptional upregulation of PD-L1.  Methods:   Based on transcriptome results, RelB was manipulated in multiple human and murine PCa cell lines. Activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were cocultured with PCa cells with different levels of RelB to examine the effect of tumourous RelB on T cell immunity. Male mice were injected with murine PCa cells to validate the effect of RelB on the PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune checkpoint using both tumour growth and metastatic experimental models.  Results:   PD-L1 is uniquely expressed at a high level in PCa with high constitutive RelB and correlates with the patients' Gleason scores. Indeed, a high level of PD-L1 is associated with RelB nuclear translocation in AR-negative aggressive PCa cells. Conversely, the silencing of RelB in advanced PCa cells resulted in reduced PD-L1 expression and enhanced susceptibility of PCa cells to the T cell immune response in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, a proximal NF-κB enhancer element was identified in the core promoter region of the human CD274 gene, which is responsible for RelB-mediated PD-L1 transcriptional activation. This finding provides an informative insight into immune checkpoint blockade by administering RelB within the tumour microenvironment.  Conclusion:   This study deciphers the molecular mechanism by which tumourous RelB contributes to immune evasion by inhibiting T cell immunity via the amplification of the PD-L1/PD-1-mediated immune checkpoint.""","""['Yanyan Zhang', 'Shuyi Zhu', 'Yuanyuan Du', 'Fan Xu', 'Wenbo Sun', 'Zhi Xu', 'Xiumei Wang', 'Peipei Qian', 'Qin Zhang', 'Jifeng Feng', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Inverse relationship between PSA and IL-8 in prostate cancer: an insight into a NF-κB-mediated mechanism.', 'Disruption of SIRT7 Increases the Efficacy of Checkpoint Inhibitor via MEF2D Regulation of Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.', 'HZ08 suppresses RelB-activated MnSOD expression and enhances Radiosensitivity of prostate Cancer cells.', 'Vitamin D receptor-mediated suppression of RelB in antigen presenting cells: a paradigm for ligand-augmented negative transcriptional regulation.', 'PD-1/PD-L1 pathway inhibitors in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Insights into the Relationship between Pentraxin-3 and Cancer.', 'Current insight into the regulation of PD-L1 in cancer.', 'PTX3 mediates the infiltration, migration, and inflammation-resolving-polarization of macrophages in glioblastoma.']"""

Despite the availability of these large-scale data, relatively few variants have been functionally characterized, mainly because the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) map to the non-coding regions of the human genome. The functional characterization of these non-coding variants and the identification of their target genes remain challenging.  Results:   In this communication, we explore the potential functional mechanisms of non-coding SNPs by integrating GWAS with the high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data for breast and prostate cancers. We show that more genetic variants map to regulatory elements through the 3D genome structure than the 1D linear genome lacking physical chromatin interactions. Importantly, the association of enhancers, transcription factors, and their target genes with breast and prostate cancers tends to be higher when these regulatory elements are mapped to high-risk SNPs through spatial interactions compared to simply using a linear proximity. Finally, we demonstrate that topologically associating domains (TADs) carrying high-risk SNPs also contain gene regulatory elements whose association with cancer is generally higher than those belonging to control TADs containing no high-risk variants.  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that many SNPs may contribute to the cancer development by affecting the expression of certain tumor-related genes through long-range chromatin interactions with gene regulatory elements. Integrating large-scale genetic datasets with the 3D genome structure offers an attractive and unique approach to systematically investigate the functional mechanisms of genetic variants in disease risk and progression.""","""['Noha Osman', 'Abd-El-Monsif Shawky', 'Michal Brylinski']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Genom Data""","""[""Enhancer variants associated with Alzheimer's disease affect gene expression via chromatin looping."", 'Bromodomain protein 4 discriminates tissue-specific super-enhancers containing disease-specific susceptibility loci in prostate and breast cancer.', 'On the identification of potential regulatory variants within genome wide association candidate SNP sets.', 'From DNA human sequence to the chromatin higher order organisation and its biological meaning: Using biomolecular interaction networks to understand the influence of structural variation on spatial genome organisation and its functional effect.', 'Mechanistic insights into genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.', 'Identification of non-coding silencer elements and their regulation of gene expression.']"""

Kaplan Meier analysis was used to determine survival in a large retrospective cohort of radical prostatectomy samples. qRS was validated in two additional, distinct cohorts that include international cases and tissue from both radical prostatectomy and biopsy specimens. In the developmental cohort (Baylor College of Medicine, n = 482), patients whose tumor had qRS > 34% had increased risk of prostate cancer-specific death (HR 2.94; p = 0.039). This result was replicated in two validation cohorts, where patients with qRS > 34% had increased risk of prostate cancer-specific death (MEDVAMC; n = 332; HR 2.64; p = 0.02) and also biochemical recurrence (Canary; n = 988; HR 1.51; p = 0.001). By multivariate analysis, these associations were shown to hold independent predictive value when compared to currently used clinicopathologic factors including Gleason score and PSA. qRS is a new, validated biomarker that predicts prostate cancer death and biochemical recurrence across three distinct cohorts.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of ribociclib plus docetaxel in a phase Ib/II study in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Patients and methods:   Patients had chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC with progression on ≥ 1 androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI). The phase II primary endpoint was 6-month radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) rate, with an alternative hypothesis of 55% versus 35% historical control. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) were collected at baseline and genomically profiled.  Result:   Forty-three patients were enrolled (N = 30 in phase II). Two dose-limiting toxicities were observed (grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia). The recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and schedule was docetaxel 60 mg/m2 every 21 days plus ribociclib 400 mg/day on days 1-4 and 8-15 with filgrastim on days 5-7. At the RP2D, neutropenia was the most common grade ≥ 3 adverse event (37%); however, no cases of febrile neutropenia were observed. The primary endpoint was met; the 6-month rPFS rate was 65.8% [95% confidence interval (CI): 50.6%-85.5%; P = 0.005] and median rPFS was 8.1 months (95% CI, 6.0-10.0 months). Thirty-two percent of evaluable patients achieved a PSA50 response. Nonamplified MYC in baseline CTCs was associated with longer rPFS (P = 0.052).  Conclusions:   The combination of intermittent ribociclib plus every-3-weeks docetaxel demonstrated acceptable toxicity and encouraging efficacy in ARSI-pretreated mCRPC.

Patients and methods:   An observational cross-sectional cohort study, including all patients who underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided PBx (TRUS PBx) for the suspicion of prostate cancer at the Department of Urology, Skåne University Hospital between 1 May 2003 and 31 December 2017. Positive blood and urinary cultures were considered markers of bloodstream infection (BSI) and urinary tract infection (UTI), respectively. For all patients, details regarding blood or urine cultures from the date of the TRUS PBx and 14 days onwards were retrieved.  Results:   In total, 8973 TRUS PBx procedures were performed in 6597 men during the study period. Over time, there was a trend towards a changing case-mix, with PBx procedures increasingly being performed in older patients, patients with lower prostate-specific antigen values, and higher prostate volumes. During the study period, the number of PBx procedures performed increased for each time period and we found an increasing rate of infectious complications in the last period. Overall, the rates of BSI and UTI with at least one relevant pathogen were 1% (88/8973) and 1.8% (159/8973), respectively. In total, 16 of 90 strains (18%) were extended spectrum beta-lactamases producing, with an increasing proportion over time. The proportion of ciprofloxacin-resistant pathogens did not increase over time.  Conclusion:   During the 15 years of this study, BSI and UTI after TRUS PBx increased. The rise of infectious complications after TRUS PBx in this population is unlikely to be explained by quinolone-resistance, as ciprofloxacin-resistance did not increase in the blood and urinary samples obtained during the study period.

Melatonin has shown antiproliferative and antimetastatic activities but has not yet been shown to be active in osteoblastic bone lesions of prostate cancer.

Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is becoming familiar among researchers and industrialists. The PAI is found useful in several applications of brain and cancer imaging such as prostate cancer, breast cancer, and ovarian cancer. At the same time, the vessel images hold important medical details which offer strategies for a qualified diagnosis. Recently developed image processing techniques can be employed to segment vessels. Since vessel segmentation on PAI is a difficult process, this paper employs metaheuristic optimization-based vascular segmentation techniques for PAI. The proposed model involves two distinct kinds of vessel segmentation approaches such as Shannon's entropy function (SEF) and multilevel Otsu thresholding (MLOT). Moreover, the threshold value and entropy function in the segmentation process are optimized using three metaheuristics such as the cuckoo search (CS), equilibrium optimizer (EO), and harmony search (HS) algorithms. A detailed experimental analysis is made on benchmark PAI dataset, and the results are inspected under varying aspects.

However, mCRPC patients are mainly frail elderly men, constantly accompanied by comorbidities and showing poor tolerance to standard docetaxel chemotherapy. Some exploratory studies administering modified chemotherapy regimens have reported noninferior oncologic outcomes with fewer adverse events, yet most are retrospective or small studies, and prospective randomized controlled trials have rarely been conducted. Therefore, we designed this modified docetaxel chemotherapy regimen in patients with mCRPC, aiming to evaluate its efficacy and safety compared with the standard docetaxel chemotherapy regimen.  Methods:   This is an open-label, multi-institutional, prospective, randomized non-inferiority trial. A total of 128 patients with mCRPC will be randomized to receive ADT combined with modified docetaxel chemotherapy (experimental group, n=64) or ADT combined with standard docetaxel chemotherapy (control group, n=64). Patients in the experimental group will receive a modified regimen with docetaxel 40 mg/m2 on the 1st day and 35 mg/m2 on the 8th day, repeated every 21 days. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival at 2 years. Secondary endpoints include overall survival, prostate-specific antigen response rate, pain response rate, toxicity and quality of life.  Discussion:   The expected benefit for the patient in the experimental arm is noninferior efficacy with decreased toxicity and improved quality of life compared with that in the control arm. To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first multicentre prospective randomized study to assess the efficacy and safety of modified docetaxel chemotherapy in patients with mCRPC in China.

However, brachytherapy alone with or without ADT is not well defined and is currently not recommended for UIR prostate cancer. We hypothesized that men treated with brachytherapy with or without ADT have comparable survival rates to men treated with EBRT with or without ADT.  Methods:   A total of 31,783 men diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 with UIR prostate cancer were retrospectively reviewed from the National Cancer Database. Men were stratified into 4 groups: EBRT (n=12,985), EBRT plus ADT (n=12,960), brachytherapy (n=4,535), or brachytherapy plus ADT (n=1,303). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for covariable imbalances, and weight-adjusted multivariable analysis (MVA) using Cox regression modeling was used to compare overall survival (OS) hazard ratios (HRs).  Results:   Relative to EBRT alone, the following treatments were associated with improved OS: EBRT plus ADT (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.97; P=.002), brachytherapy alone (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.98; P=.01), and brachytherapy plus ADT (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88; P=.00006). Brachytherapy correlated with improved OS relative to EBRT in men who were not treated with ADT (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99; P=.03) and in those receiving ADT (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95; P=.004). At 10-year follow-up, 56% and 63% of men receiving EBRT and brachytherapy, respectively, were alive (P<.0001). IPTW was used to determine the average treatment effect of definitive brachytherapy. Relative to EBRT, definitive brachytherapy correlated with improved OS (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P=.009) on weight-adjusted MVA.  Conclusions:   Definitive brachytherapy was associated with improved OS compared with EBRT. The addition of ADT to both EBRT and definitive brachytherapy was associated with improved OS.

Aberrant intracellular calcium (Cai2+) is known to promote neoplastic transformation and treatment resistance. There is growing evidence that voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC) expression is increased in cancer, particularly CACNA1D/CaV1.3 in CRPC. The aim of this study was to investigate if increased CaV1.3 drives resistance to ADT and determine its associated impact on Cai2+ and cancer biology. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that CACNA1D gene expression is increased in ADT treated PCa patients. This was corroborated in both in vivo LNCaP xenograft mouse and in vitro PCa cell line models, which demonstrated a significant increase in CaV1.3 protein expression following ADT with bicalutamide. Expression was found to be of a shortened 170kDa CaV1.3 isoform associated with plasma and intracellular membranes, which failed to induce calcium influx following membrane depolarisation. Instead, under ADT CaV1.3 mediated a rise in basal cytosolic calcium and an increase in store operated calcium entry (SOCE). This mechanism was found to promote the proliferation and survival of ADT resistant CRPC cells. Overall, this study demonstrates for the first time in PCa that under ADT specific CaV1.3 isoforms promote an upregulation of SOCE which contributes to treatment resistance and CRPC biology. Thus, this novel oncochannel represents a target for therapeutic development to improve PCa patient outcomes.""","""[""Debbie O'Reilly"", 'Tim Downing', 'Sana Kouba', 'Marie Potier-Cartereau', 'Declan J McKenna', 'Christophe Vandier', 'Paul J Buchanan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Calcium""","""['Data pertaining to aberrant intracellular calcium handling during androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Pre-existing Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer-like Cells in Primary Prostate Cancer Promote Resistance to Hormonal Therapy.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Materials and methods:   Deep convolutional neural networks were used to develop the AI model. The AI model was trained on The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostatic Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) whole slide images (WSI) and data set (n = 243) to predict 3-year biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) and was subsequently validated on WSI from patients with PCa (n = 173) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  Results:   Our AI-powered platform can extract visual and subvisual morphologic features from WSI to identify driver regions predictive of early recurrence of PCa (regions of interest [ROIs]) after RP. The ROIs were ranked with AI-morphometric scores, which were prognostic for 3-year biochemical recurrence (area under the curve [AUC], 0.78), which is significantly better than the GGG overall (AUC, 0.62). The AI-morphometric scores also showed high accuracy in the prediction of recurrence for low- or intermediate-risk PCa-AUC, 0.76, 0.84, and 0.81 for GGG1, GGG2, and GGG3, respectively.

Methods:   Twenty consecutive patients prospectively underwent MRI-US PBx, followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). The AI algorithm was trained with the integration of MR-US image data with a MRI-US PBx trajectory-proven pathology. The relationship with the 3D-cancer-mapping of RARP specimens was compared between AI system-suggested 3D-CSCa mapping and an experienced radiologist's suggested 3D-CSCa mapping on MRI alone according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2. The characteristics of detected and undetected tumors at AI were compared in 22,968 image data. The relationships between CSCa volumes and volumes predicted by AI as well as the radiologist's reading based on PI-RADS were analyzed.  Results:   The concordance of the CSCa center with that in RARP specimens was significantly higher in the AI prediction than the radiologist' reading (83% vs. 54%, p = 0.036). CSCa volumes predicted with AI were more accurate (r = 0.90, p < 0.001) than the radiologist's reading. The limitations include that the elastic fusion technology has its own registration error.  Conclusions:   We presented a novel pilot AI algorithm for 3D prediction of PCa. AI was trained by integration of multiparametric MR-US image data and fusion biopsy trajectory-proven pathology data.

Methods:   Male volunteers (n = 101), aged 20-80 (mean, 49.9) years were randomized to exercise at the first or second study visit. They performed 1 h of either cycling or rowing on a stationary machine. To determine exercise-induced effects on the PSA level, serum total PSA (tPSA) and free PSA (fPSA) concentrations were evaluated before and after exercise and another sampling was performed at the second study visit. Pre-exercise and postexercise tPSA and fPSA concentrations were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. The results were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test.  Results:   A significant (p < 0.001) average increase in tPSA after exercise (1.14 ± 1.11 ng/ml to 1.24 ± 1.26 ng/ml [mean, +8.8%]) was observed after both cycling and rowing, without significant differences between the sports (p = 0.54).

This was a retrospective, exploratory study. Social factors, depression, and prostate screening data on 267 male patients were retrieved from medical records from 2014 to 2018. Patients that were not screened for depression were associated with a lower probability of having received a PSA screening (OR = .40, p = 02). Of those screened for depression, higher scores were associated with lower PSA screening (OR = .89, p = .02). Patients who self-identified as Hispanic (OR = .19, p <. 001), African American (AA) (OR = .06, P = .01) or White (OR = .12, P = .02) had lower odds of PSA screening compared to Black-Caribbean. The above clinical evidence is a practice implication for nurses and health care professionals. Depression screening predicted higher rates of prostate screening, while higher depression scores predicted lower prostate screening. AA and Hispanic subgroups were less likely to be screened for prostate cancer than the non-U.S. born Black-Caribbean men. Findings underscore the importance of developing community-based culturally sensitive approaches to prostate preventative care.

Gallium 68 (68Ga) prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT-guided targeted biopsy has the potential to improve diagnostic yield of PCa. Purpose To evaluate the safety and diagnostic yield of 68Ga PSMA PET/CT-guided, robotic-arm assisted transgluteal prostatic biopsy. Materials and Methods In this single-center nonrandomized prospective trial, participants with a clinical suspicion of PCa (serum prostate-specific antigen level > 4 ng/mL) were recruited from January 2019 to September 2020. After whole-body 68Ga PSMA PET/CT, participants with PSMA-avid intraprostatic lesions underwent PET-guided transgluteal biopsy by using an automated robotic arm. To assess safety and diagnostic yield, procedure-related complications and histopathologic results were documented. Pain during the procedure was scored by a visual analog scale. Descriptive statistics were applied; qualitative variables were reported in percentages. Results Seventy-eight participants (mean age, 66 years ± 7 [standard deviation]; 36 participants [46%] with prior negative results at transrectal US-guided biopsy) were enrolled. Fifty-six (72%) participants had PSMA-avid lesions (prior negative results at transrectal US-guided biopsy in 22 of 56 [39%]) and underwent targeted biopsy. PCa was confirmed in 54 of 56 (96%) participants, and clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥ 7) was confirmed in 24 of 54 (44%). Two participants had nonrepresentative samples that required rebiopsy. All participants experienced pain during the procedure, mild (median visual analog scale score, 1; interquartile range, 1-2) in 36 of 56 (64%) and moderate (median visual analog scale score, 5; interquartile range, 5-6) in 20 of 56 (36%). Postprocedure complications were noted in five of 56 (9%) participants and were minor (hematuria, four participants; hematospermia, one participant; and gluteal pain, two participants). No participant developed a postprocedural infection. Conclusion Transgluteal prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT-guided, robotic-targeted prostatic biopsy is safe with a high diagnostic yield of prostate cancer for PSMA-avid lesions.

Specifically, cancers tend to undergo metabolic reprogramming to upregulate a cell‑dependent glutamine (Gln) metabolism. Notably, hepatocellular cell adhesion molecule (HepaCAM) has been previously reported to serve a key role as a tumour suppressor. However, the possible regulatory role of HepaCAM in Gln metabolism in prostate cancer (PCa) remains poorly understood. In the present study, bioinformatics analysis predicted a significant negative correlation among the expression of HepaCAM, phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate 3‑kinase catalytic subunit α (PIK3CA), glutaminase (GLS) and solute carrier family 1 member 5 (SLC1A5), components of Gln metabolism, in clinical and genomic datasets. Immunohistochemistry results verified a negative correlation between HepaCAM and PIK3CA expression in PCa tissues. Subsequently, liquid chromatography‑tandem mass spectrometry (LC‑MS/MS) and gas chromatography‑mass spectrometry (GC‑MS) assays were performed, and the results revealed markedly reduced levels of Gln and metabolic flux in the blood samples of patients with PCa and in PCa cells. Mechanistically, overexpression of HepaCAM inhibited Gln metabolism and proliferation by regulating PIK3CA in PCa cells. In addition, Gln metabolism was discovered to be stress‑resistant in PCa cells, since the expression levels of GLS and SLC1A5 remained high for a period of time after Gln starvation. However, overexpression of HepaCAM reversed this resistance to some extent. Additionally, alpelisib, a specific inhibitor of PIK3CA, effectively potentiated the inhibitory effects of HepaCAM overexpression on Gln metabolism and cell proliferation through mass spectrometry and CCK‑8 experiments. In addition, the inhibitory effect of PIK3CA on the growth of tumor tissue in nude mice was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry in vivo. To conclude, the results from the present study revealed an abnormal Gln metabolic profile in the blood samples of patients with PCa, suggesting that it can be applied as a clinical diagnostic tool for PCa. Additionally, a key role of the HepaCAM/PIK3CA axis in regulating Gln metabolism, cell proliferation and tumour growth was identified. The combination of alpelisib treatment with the upregulation of HepaCAM expression may serve as a novel method for treating patients with PCa.""","""['Zhenting He#', 'Yingying Gao#', 'Ting Li', 'Chaowen Yu', 'Liping Ou', 'Chunli Luo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['GLS-driven glutamine catabolism contributes to prostate cancer radiosensitivity by regulating the redox state, stemness and ATG5-mediated autophagy.', 'Panobinostat reverses HepaCAM gene expression and suppresses proliferation by increasing histone acetylation in prostate cancer.', 'HepaCAM inhibits cell proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer by suppressing nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor via its cytoplasmic domain.', 'The pathways related to glutamine metabolism, glutamine inhibitors and their implication for improving the efficiency of chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'The role of glutamine metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Cancer metabolites: promising biomarkers for cancer liquid biopsy.', 'Molecular and metabolic alterations of 2,3-dihydroquinazolin-4(1H)-one derivatives in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   This retrospective study of electronic health records in the US Flatiron database (NCT04516161) included patients with mCRPC treated with radium-223 between January 2013 and June 2019. Median overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50% reduction) from start of radium-223 treatment were the primary and secondary endpoints, respectively. Patient characteristics were compared between those who survived ≥2 years versus <2 years, including a subgroup who survived <6 months.  Results:   In the 1180 patients identified, median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI: 12.1-13.7), and 13% of patients with data at 6 months had a PSA response. The survival groups included 775 patients (65.7%) who survived <2 years (including 264 (22.4%) who survived <6 months) and 185 patients (15.7%) who survived ≥2 years; 220 patients (18.6%) had incomplete follow-up data and were censored. On multivariate analysis, age >75 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) 2-4, visceral metastases, prior symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs), and prior chemotherapy were independently prognostic of reduced OS. For patients with survival ≥2 years versus <2 years, median age was 71 versus 75 years, 4% versus 14% had ECOG PS 2-4, 4% versus 10% had visceral metastases, 38% versus 44% had prior SSEs, and 16% versus 32% had prior chemotherapy.  Conclusions:   In this study of men with mCRPC treated in real-world clinical practice, median OS was consistent with that seen in the phase 3 ALSYMPCA trial.

As the cost of sequencing decreases, the question of expanding multi-gene cancer panels to a broader population arises. We evaluated how many additional actionable genetic variants are returned by unrestricted panel testing in the private sector compared to those which would be returned by adhering to current NHS eligibility criteria. We reviewed 152 patients referred for multi-gene cancer panels in the private sector between 2014 and 2016. Genetic counselling and disclosure of all results was standard of care provided by the Consultant. Every panel conducted was compared to current eligibility criteria. A germline pathogenic / likely pathogenic variant (P/LP), in a gene relevant to the personal or family history of cancer, was detected in 15 patients (detection rate of 10%). 46.7% of those found to have the P/LP variants (7 of 15), or 4.6% of the entire set (7 of 152), did not fulfil NHS eligibility criteria. 46.7% of P/LP variants in this study would have been missed by national testing guidelines, all of which were actionable. However, patients who do not fulfil eligibility criteria have a higher Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) burden. We demonstrated that the current England NHS threshold for genetic testing is missing pathogenic variants which would alter management in 4.6%, nearly 1 in 20 individuals.

We report response assessment after bone SBRT using radiological changes through time and clinical examination of patients.  Methods:   We analyzed retrospectively oligo-metastatic/progressive patients with bony lesions treated with SBRT between 12/2008 and 10/2018, without in-field re-irradiation, in our institution. Radiological data were obtained from imaging modalities used for SBRT planning and follow-up purposes in picture archiving and communication system and assessed by two independent radiologists blind to the time of treatment. Several radiological changes were described. Radiographic response assessment was classified according to University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center criteria. Pain response and the neurological deficit were captured before and at least 6 months after SBRT.  Results:   A total of 35 of the 74 reviewed patients were eligible, presenting 43 bone metastases, with 51.2% (n = 22) located in the vertebral column. Median age at the time of SBRT was 66 years (range 38-84) and 77.1% (n = 27) were male. Histology was mainly prostate (51.4%, n = 18) and breast cancer (14.3%, n = 5). Median total radiation dose delivered was 24 Gy (range 24-42), in three fractions (range 2-7), prescribed to 70-90% isodose-line. After a median follow-up of 1.8 years (range < 1-8.2) for survivors, complete or partial response, stable, and progressive disease occurred in 0%, 11.4% (n = 4), 68.6% (n = 24), and 20.0% (n = 7) of the patients, respectively. Twenty patients (57.1%) died during the follow-up time, all from disease progression, yet 70% (n = 14) from this population with local stable disease after SBRT. From patients who were symptomatic and available for follow-up, almost half (44.4%) reported pain reduction after SBRT.  Conclusions:   Eighty percent of the patients showed local control after SBRT for bone metastases. Pain response was favorable. For more accurate response assessment, comparing current imaging modalities with advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI and PET/CT, in a prospective and standardized way is warranted.

This work aims to develop novel titanium-45 (t½ = 3.08 h) PET tracers using Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) targeting vectors for imaging of prostate cancer as proof of concept for this relatively unexplored isotope.  Procedures:   Titanium-45 was produced on the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) TR24 cyclotron using proton bombardments on natural scandium foils and separated using procedures described previously [1]. After purification, Titanium-45 was used to radiolabel two PSMA-targeting molecules; DFO-DUPA and LDFC-DUPA. Radiochemical yields were determined via radio-high purity liquid chromatography (radioHPLC). The radiolabeled compounds were tested both in vitro and in vivo using PSMA+ cell lines (LNCaP and 22Rv1) and PSMA- cell lines (PC3).  Results:   Titanium-45 was produced and purified in yields suitable for research studies. Radiochemical yields of up to 98 ± 1% were achieved with DFO-DUPA and 92 ± 7% with LDFC-DUPA. PSMA specific targeting was observed in vitro in PSMA positive cells (LNCaP (0.6% ± 0.05%) and confirmed by blocking (0.15% ± 0.04%) (P < 0.0001)), compared to uptake in the PSMA negative cells (PC3 (0.07% ± 0.008%)) and confirmed by blocking (0.07% ± 0.01%) (P = 0.5253). In vivo studies demonstrated statistically significant uptake in LNCaP tumors (2.3% ± 0.3% ID/g) compared to PC3 tumor uptake (0.1% ± 0.07%).  Conclusions:   This work shows that titanium-45 can be used to radiolabel PSMA targeting compounds with high radiochemical yields. These radiolabeled compounds remain intact in serum for at least two half-lives of titanium-45, showing that these compounds would be appropriate for implementation in the clinical setting. This study shows the feasibility of using titanium-45 as positron emitting radiometal for use in imaging PSMA+ prostate cancer, and illustrates that further research is in this area is warranted.""","""['Ivis F Chaple', 'Hailey A Houson', 'Angus Koller', 'Apurva Pandey', 'Eszter Boros', 'Suzanne E Lapi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucl Med Biol""","""['Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Tumor Uptake of Triazine Dendrimers Decorated with Four, Sixteen, and Sixty-Four PSMA-Targeted Ligands: Passive versus Active Tumor Targeting.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Characterization of an 18F-AlF-Labeled PSMA Ligand for Imaging of PSMA-Expressing Xenografts.', 'Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.', 'PET imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer: current state of the art and future challenges.', 'Radiometallation and photo-triggered release of ready-to-inject radiopharmaceuticals from the solid phase.']"""

Patterns and trends however have been less favourable for most eastern countries.  Methods:   We computed cancer mortality rates in western (WE) and eastern European (EE) countries using the official mortality database of the World Health Organisation, using joinpoint regression models to identify significant changes in trends over time.  Results:   Cancer mortality declined by 1-1.4% annually in WE since 1990, to reach an age-standardised rate (world standard) of 125.4/100,000 men and 81.3/100,000 women in 2016. In contrast, EE rates only started to decline around the 2000s in men and remained stable in women, to reach 171.9/100,000 men and 98.2/100,000 women. Lung cancer rates were 30.8/100,000 men and 14/100,000 women in WE versus 47.1/100,000 men and 15.2/100,000 women in EE. In relative terms, the mortality excess in EE increased from 32 to 37% in men and from 15 to 21% in women, compared with WE. The largest percent excesses were for cancers of the upper respiratory tract, stomach, intestines and lung in men and uterus in women. Prostate cancer rates increased in EE to reach 12.7/100,000 in 2016, whereas they decreased to 10.2/100,000 in WE. Compared with rates in 1990, over the period 1991-2016, about 3.9 million cancer deaths were avoided in WE, but no notable improvements was seen in EE. If cancer mortality rates in EE had been those observed in WE, over 55,000 deaths would have been avoided in 2016.  Conclusion:   Differences in lifestyle patterns, mainly smoking and alcohol, besides different roll-out of improvements in cancer diagnosis and management are the key determinants of the persisting difference in cancer mortality between western and eastern Europe.

Methods and materials:   A cohort of 219, hormone-naïve, NCCN intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients were derived from a phase 2 study of 5 × 9 Gy prostate cancer SABR. PSA-D was calculated at 3 and 6 months by dividing serum PSA by the MR-derived prostate CTV, while the slope of the 3-6 months curve was used to express the kinetics of PSA-D decay.  Results:   The median follow-up was 60.3 (range 46-76) months, and the actuarial 7-year bRFS was 98.0% for intermediate-risk favorable (FIR) patients versus 84.5% for the unfavorable (UIR) subgroup (P = 0.02). Fourteen patients developed a Phoenix-defined biochemical PSA relapse (bRFS) at a median of 34.2 months, 11 confirmed with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scan that revealed tracer uptake at the site of dominant intraprostatic pretreatment lesion in 8 patients. The 3-month PSA-D concertation (cut-off 0.08 ng/ml2) and 3-6 months decay slope (cut-off -0.45) values were predictive of long-term bRFS. A dual adverse PSA-D permutation was detected in 25/148 UIR patients, exhibiting 47.5% 7-year bRFS compared with 94.1% for the remaining 123 UIR patients with favorable PSA-D kinetics (P = 0.0006). Intraprostatic local relapse in patients with a 3-month PSA-D > 0.080 ng/ml2 was 11.0% vs. 1.7% for patients with PSA-D ≤ 0.080 ng/ml2 (P = 0.01) and 2.3% vs. 4.3%, respectively, for nodal progression (P = 0.68).  Conclusions:   Early post-treatment PSA-D kinetics transcends pre-treatment risk stratification of tumor relapse and adds a nuance in the biological characterization of intermediate-risk prostate cancer phenotypes.

Methods:   Among patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer treated with radical external beam radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, those who underwent Ga68-PSMA PETCT for rising PSA during follow up were analysed. Patterns of recurrence in Ga68-PSMA PETCT were studied. Extra-prostatic recurrences ≤5 were considered oligometastases. Local and oligometastatic recurrences were deemed suitable for focal salvage therapy. Probabilities of identifying recurrent lesion and potentially salvageable recurrences in Ga68-PSMA PETCT in relation to PSA were calculated.  Results:   Total 114 patients were included (69% high-risk). Radiotherapy was hypofractionated in 57% (moderate 40%, extreme 17%), with median prostate EQD2 78.5 Gy. Median time from radiotherapy to Ga68-PSMA PETCT was 4.3 years (IQR 2.4-6.4), with median PSA 4.7 ng/mL (IQR 2.6-10.7) at scan. Uptake suggesting recurrence was observed in 91.2% patients, with positivity of 75%, 87%, 89%, and 100% at PSA thresholds ≤2, ≤5, ≤10, and >10 ng/mL respectively. Probability of detecting recurrence in Ga68-PSMA PETCT increased with higher PSA at scan (AUC = 0.82). Uptake was local in 20 (17.5%), oligometastatic in 39 (34.2%), and polymetastatic in 45 (39.5%) patients. Recurrence was potentially salvageable in 59/104 (56.7%) patients, being 67% at PSA ≤2 ng/mL but only 38% at PSA >10 ng/mL. Probability of recurrence being potentially salvageable declined with increasing PSA at scan (AUC = 0.68).

Methods:   Patients with D'Amico IRPC were included in the study. In the overall cohort and subgroups (biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group 2 and 3), patients were divided into two groups as PLND and no-PLND. More extensive PLND, defined as a number of removed nodes (NRN) ≥ 75th percentile.  Results:   After exclusion, a total of 631 patients were included: 351 (55.6%) had PLND and 280 (44.4%) had no-PLND. The mean age was 63.1 ± 3.60 years. The median NRN was 8.0 (1.0-40.0). The mean follow-up period was 47.7 ± 37.5 months. The lymph node involvement (LNI) rate was 5.7% in the overall cohort, 3.9% in ISUP grade 2, and 10.8% in ISUP grade 3. Patients with PLND were associated with more aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics but no significant difference in biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) was found between patients with PLND and no-PLND (p = 0.642). In the subgroup analysis for ISUP grades 2 and 3, no significant difference in BCRFS outcomes was found in patients with PLND and No-PLND (p = 0.680 and p = 0.922). Also, PLND extent had no effect on BCRFS (p = 0.569). The multivariable Cox regression model adjusted for preoperative tumor characteristics revealed that prostate specific antigen (PSA) (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.01-1.25; p = 0.048) was an independent predictor of biochemical recurrence (BCR). The optimum cut-off value for PSA, which can predict BCRFS, was assigned to be 7.81 ng/ml, with an AUC of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.571-0.688). The highest sensitivity and specificity were 0.667 and 0.549.  Conclusion:   Overall and cancer-specific survival analyzes were not evaluated because not enough events were observed. Neither PLND nor its extent improved BCRFS outcomes in IRPC.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the lack of a robust antitumor adaptive immune response in the prostate are poorly understood, which hinders the development of novel immunotherapeutic approaches.  Aims:   Most inflammatory infiltrates in the prostate are centered around benign glands and stroma, which can confound the molecular characterization of the antitumor immune response. We sought to analytically validate a chromogenic-based multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) approach applicable to whole slide digital image analysis to quantify T cell subsets from the tumor microenvironment of primary prostatic adenocarcinomas. As an initial application, we tested the hypothesis that PTEN loss leads to an altered antitumor immune response by comparing matched regions of tumors within the same individual with and without PTEN loss.  Materials & methods:   Using the HALO Image Analysis Platform (Indica Labs), we trained a classifier to quantify the densities of eight T cell phenotypes separately in the tumor epithelial and stromal subcompartments.  Results:   The iterative chromogenic approach using 7 different antibodies on the same slide provides highly similar findings to results using individually stained slides with single antibodies. Our main findings in carcinomas (benign removed) include the following: i) CD4+ T cells are present at higher density than CD8+ T cells; ii) all T cell subsets are present at higher densities in the stromal compartment compared to the epithelial tumor compartment; iii) most CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are PD1+; iv) cancer foci with PTEN loss harbored increased numbers of T cells compared to regions without PTEN loss, in both stromal and epithelial compartments; and v) the increases in T cells in PTEN loss regions were associated with ERG gene fusion status.  Discussion:   This modular approach can apply to any IHC-validated antibody combination and sets the groundwork for more detailed spatial analyses.

We hypothesized that a considerable proportion of such patients will exhibit clinically meaningful GGG upgrading or non-organ confined (NOC) stage at radical prostatectomy (RP).  Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2010-2015) we identified RP-patients with cT1c-stage and B-GGG1, B-GGG2, or B-GGG3 and PSA 20-50 ng/ml. Rates of GGG4 or GGG5 and/or rates of NOC stage (≥ pT3 and/or pN1) were analyzed. Subsequently, separate univariable and multivariable logistic regression models tested for predictors of NOC stage and upgrading at RP.  Results:   Of 486 assessable patients, 134 (28%) exhibited B-GGG1, 209 (43%) B-GGG2, and 143 (29%) B-GGG3, respectively. The overall upgrading and NOC rates were 11% and 51% for a combined rate of upgrading and/or NOC stage of 53%. In multivariable logistic regression models predicting upgrading, only B-GGG3 was an independent predictor (odds ratio [OR]: 5.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.21-14.19; p < 0.001).

Our goal was to analyse the characteristics and outcomes of early-stage resected lung adenocarcinomas in patients with previous cancers (PC) and correlations with adenocarcinoma subtypes.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data of patients radically operated on for stage I-II lung adenocarcinoma in 9 thoracic surgery departments between 2014 and 2017. Overall survival (OS) and time to disease relapse were evaluated between subgroups.  Results:   We included 700 consecutive patients. PC were present in 260 (37.1%). Breast adenocarcinoma, lung cancer and prostate cancer were the most frequent (21.5%, 11.5% and 11.2%, respectively). No significant differences in OS were observed between the PC and non-PC groups (P = 0.378), with 31 and 75 deaths, respectively. Patients with PC had smaller tumours and were more likely to receive sublobar resection and to be operated on with a minimally invasive approach. Previous gastric cancer (P = 0.042) and synchronous PC (when diagnosed up to 6 months before lung adenocarcinoma; P = 0.044) were related, with a worse OS. Colon and breast adenocarcinomas and melanomas were significantly related to a lower incidence of high grade (solid or micropapillary, P = 0.0039, P = 0.005 and P = 0.028 respectively), whereas patients affected by a previous lymphoma had a higher incidence of a micropapillary pattern (P = 0.008).  Conclusions:   In patients with PC, we found smaller tumours more frequently treated with minimally invasive techniques and sublobar resection, probably due to a more careful follow-up.

In vitro, the androgen receptor-negative PrCa cells express high levels of the αVβ6 integrin compared to androgen receptor-positive PrCa cells. Additionally, expression of androgen receptor (wild type or variant 7) in androgen receptor-negative PrCa cells downregulates the expression of the β6 but not αV subunit compared to control cells. We demonstrate an efficient strategy to therapeutically target the αVβ6 integrin during PrCa progression by using short interfering RNA (siRNA) loaded into PrCa cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). We first demonstrate that fluorescently-labeled siRNAs can be efficiently loaded into PrCa cell-derived sEVs by electroporation. By confocal microscopy, we show efficient internalization of these siRNA-loaded sEVs into PrCa cells. We show that sEV-mediated delivery of ITGB6-targeting siRNAs into PC3 cells specifically downregulates expression of the β6 subunit. Furthermore, treatment with sEVs encapsulating ITGB6 siRNA significantly reduces cell adhesion and migration of PrCa cells on an αVβ6-specific substrate, LAP-TGFβ1. Our results demonstrate an approach for specific targeting of the αVβ6 integrin in PrCa cells using sEVs encapsulating ITGB6-specific siRNAs.""","""['Shiv Ram Krishn', 'Vaughn Garcia', 'Nicole M Naranjo', 'Fabio Quaglia', 'Christopher D Shields', 'Maisha A Harris', 'Andrew V Kossenkov', 'Qin Liu', 'Eva Corey', 'Dario C Altieri', 'Lucia R Languino']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['The αvβ6 integrin in cancer cell-derived small extracellular vesicles enhances angiogenesis.', 'IFIT3 (interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3) modulates STAT1 expression in small extracellular vesicles.', 'Differential expression of αVβ3 and αVβ6 integrins in prostate cancer progression.', 'The ITGB6 gene: its role in experimental and clinical biology.', 'The roles of integrin αvβ6 in cancer.', 'Identification and Expression of Integrins during Testicular Fusion in Spodoptera litura.', 'The Emerging Role of Cell Adhesion Molecules on Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Application Perspectives of Nanomedicine in Cancer Treatment.']"""

Enzalutamide is a next-generation androgen receptor inhibitor, initially approved to treat castration-resistance prostate cancer. Lupeol, a triterpene present in various fruits, vegetables, has anti-oxidant and anti-proliferative activity. The present study aimed to evaluate the Enzalutamide-induced toxicity and its possible amelioration by Lupeol. We performed multiple in vitro and in vivo experiments to conclude our hypothesis. The results revealed that both Enzalutamide and Lupeol interact with DNA through electrostatic interactions. Enzalutamide (5-20 μM) caused cytotoxicity in both normal (PNT2) and cancer cells (LNCaP and 22Rv1). However, Lupeol (10-50 μM) specifically killed the cancer cells while sparing normal cells. The study further revealed that Lupeol could attenuate Enzalutamide-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity (chromosomal aberrations and micronucleus formation) to normal cells and potentially induce cytotoxicity to transformed cells. We further observed that Lupeol (40 mg/kg) mediated attenuation of the Enzalutamide (10 mg/kg) induced oxidative and DNA damages. Our study also revealed that Lupeol reverses the Enzalutamide-induced hepatic and renal damages. In conclusion, our study indicates that Lupeol can be used as an adjuvant for reducing the toxic effects and enhancing the effectiveness of Enzalutamide.""","""['Mohammad A Khan', 'Deepti Singh', 'Homa Fatma', 'Kafil Akhtar', 'Farruk Arjmand', 'Santosh Maurya', 'Hifzur R Siddique']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Drug Chem Toxicol""","""['Lupeol, a novel androgen receptor inhibitor: implications in prostate cancer therapy.', 'A novel dietary triterpene Lupeol induces fas-mediated apoptotic death of androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth in a xenograft model.', 'Lupeol triterpene, a novel diet-based microtubule targeting agent: disrupts survivin/cFLIP activation in prostate cancer cells.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Darolutamide as a Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Inhibitor in the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Fridericia platyphylla is a shrub found in Brazilian cerrado biome which has cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the antiproliferative potential of the crude hydroethanolic extract, subfraction (containing 59.3% of unusual dimeric flavonoids Brachydin E and 40.7% Brachydin F), as well as Brachydin E and Brachydin F isolated from F. platyphylla roots. The cytotoxic activity was evaluated in glioblastoma, lung, prostate, and colorectal human tumor cell lines. The crude hydroethanolic extract did not present cytotoxic activity, but its subfraction presented lower IC50 values for glioblastoma (U-251) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PC-3) cell lines. Brachydins E and F significantly reduced cell viability, proliferation, and clonogenic potential of PC-3, inducing them to the process of regulated cell death. In silico studies have indicated nuclear receptors as targets for Brachydins E and F, and molecular docking has pointed out their binding into glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ligand pocket. Targeting GR pathway has been described as a therapeutic strategy, especially for prostate cancer.

We report on the work of the PIONEER Consortium in this context for prostate cancer (PCa).  Objective:   To update and integrate existing core outcome sets (COS) for PCa for the different stages of the disease, assess their applicability, and develop standardised definitions of prioritised outcomes.  Evidence acquisition:   We followed a four-stage process involving: (1) systematic reviews; (2) qualitative interviews; (3) expert group meetings to agree standardised terminologies; and (4) recommendations for the most appropriate definitions of clinician-reported outcomes.  Evidence synthesis:   Following four systematic reviews, a multinational interview study, and expert group consensus meetings, we defined the most clinically suitable definitions for (1) COS for localised and locally advanced PCa and (2) COS for metastatic and nonmetastatic castration-resistant PCa. No new outcomes were identified in our COS for localised and locally advanced PCa. For our COS for metastatic and nonmetastatic castration-resistant PCa, nine new core outcomes were identified.  Conclusions:   These are the first COS for PCa for which the definitions of prioritised outcomes have been surveyed in a systematic, transparent, and replicable way. This is also the first time that outcome definitions across all prostate cancer COS have been agreed on by a multidisciplinary expert group and recommended for use in research and clinical practice. To limit heterogeneity across research, these COS should be recommended for future effectiveness trials, systematic reviews, guidelines and clinical practice of localised and metastatic PCa.  Patient summary:   Patient outcomes after treatment for prostate cancer (PCa) are difficult to compare because of variability.

However, the tumor type in ADPC patients transforms into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after 18-24 months of treatments, the underlying mechanism of which remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the potential pathological mechanism of the conversion from ADPC to CRPC by exploring the function of lung cancer metastasis-related protein 1 (LCMR1). We found that LCMR1 and glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα) were highly expressed in CRPC tissues, compared to ADPC tissues, and were accompanied by high concentrations of inflammatory factors. Knocking down LCMR1 or GRα in CRPC cells led to inhibition of metastasis and proliferation and induction of apoptosis. The expression of HSP90 and IL-6 was upregulated and that of androgen receptor was downregulated by knocking down LCMR1 or GRα in CRPC cells. Luciferase assay results indicated that the transcription of GRα was promoted by the LCMR1 promoter. The growth rate of CRPC cells in vivo was greatly decreased by knocking down LCMR1 or GRα. Lastly, CRPC cell sensitivity to enzalutamide treatment was found significantly enhanced by the knockdown of LCMR1. Taken together, LCMR1 might regulate the conversion of ADPC to CRPC by activating the GRα signaling pathway.""","""['Kai Wang', 'Xuliang Wang', 'Xian Fu', 'Ji Sun', 'Liwei Zhao', 'Huadong He', 'Yi Fan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['Anti-androgen therapy induces transcriptomic reprogramming in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a murine model.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Correlation between the expression of Pim-1 and androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'The role of glucocorticoid receptor in prostate cancer progression: from bench to bedside.', 'Deletion of LCMR1 in alveolar type II cells induces lethal impairment of lung structure and function in adult mice.', 'A narrative review of the role of glucocorticoid receptors in prostate cancer: developments in last 5 years.']"""

The molecular mechanisms underlying the trans-differentiation from CRPC to NEPC are not fully characterized, which hampers the development of effective targeted therapy.  Methods:   Bioinformatic analyses were conducted to determine the clinical correlation of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in CRPC progression. To investigate the transcriptional regulation SphK1 and neuroendocrine (NE) transcription factor genes, both chromosome immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter gene assays were performed. To demonstrate the role of SphK1 in NEPC development, neurosphere assay was carried out along with several biomarkers determined by quantitative PCR and western blot. Furthermore, in vivo NEPC xenograft models and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model were employed to determine the effect of SphK1 inhibitors and target validation.  Results:   Significant prevalence of SphK1 in NEPC development is observed from clinical datasets. SphK1 is transcriptionally repressed by androgen receptor-RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST) complex. Furthermore, sphingosine 1-phosphate produced by SphK1 can modulate REST protein turnover via MAPK signaling pathway. Also, decreased REST protein levels enhance the expression of NE markers in CRPC, enabling the transition to NEPC. Finally, specific SphK1 inhibitors can effectively inhibit the growth of NEPC tumors and block the REST protein degradation in PDX.

Methods:   The study included 168 prostate cancer patients who had received radical prostatectomy between 2012 and 2018. Kaplan-Meier plot and log-rank analysis were used to screen recurrence-free survival-related features. The nomogram was established by combining the significant coagulation features with clinicopathological characteristics by using Cox regression analysis. The accuracy and clinical significance of the nomogram model were assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve, Kaplan-Meier plot, and calibration plot. We explored the correlation between coagulation pathway activity and patient prognosis in public datasets by using gene set variation analysis (GSVA).  Results:   The results suggested that patients classified by the nomogram into the high-risk subgroup showed unfavorable prognoses compared with those in the low-risk subgroup in both the training (log-rank p < 0.0001) and validation (log-rank p = 0.0004) cohorts. The nomogram model exhibited high discriminative accuracy in the training cohort (1-year area under the curve [AUC] of 0.74 and 3-year AUC of 0.69), which was confirmed in the internal validation cohort (C-index = 0.651). The calibration plots confirmed good concordance for the prediction of recurrence-free survival at 1 and 3 years. Subgroup analyses confirmed the utility of this model in different clinicopathological subgroups. Finally, GSVA suggested that patients with higher coagulation pathway scores mostly had unfavorable prognoses compared to those with lower scores, a result consistent with the findings above.

The radiotherapy dosage quantity is limited by toxicity in organs with de-novo genitourinary toxicity occurrence remaining unperturbed. Estimation of the urethral radiation dose via anatomical contouring may improve our understanding of genitourinary toxicity and its related symptoms. Yet, urethral delineation remains an expert-dependent and time-consuming procedure. In this study, we aim to develop a fully automated segmentation tool for the prostatic urethra.  Materials and methods:   This study incorporated 939 patients' T2-weighted MRI scans (train/validation/test/excluded: 657/141/140/1 patients), including in-house and public PROSTATE-x datasets, and their corresponding ground truth urethral contours from an expert genitourinary radiologist. The AI model was developed using MONAI framework and was based on a 3D-UNet. AI model performance was determined by Dice score (volume-based) and the Centerline Distance (CLD) between the prediction and ground truth centers (slice-based). All predictions were compared to ground truth in a systematic failure analysis to elucidate the model's strengths and weaknesses. The Wilcoxon-rank sum test was used for pair-wise comparison of group differences.  Results:   The overall organ-adjusted Dice score for this model was 0.61 and overall CLD was 2.56 mm. When comparing prostates with symmetrical (n = 117) and asymmetrical (n = 23) benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), the AI model performed better on symmetrical prostates compared to asymmetrical in both Dice score (0.64 vs. 0.51 respectively, p < 0.05) and mean CLD (2.3 mm vs. 3.8 mm respectively, p < 0.05). When calculating location-specific performance, the performance was highest at the apex and lowest at the base location of the prostate for Dice and CLD. Dice location dependence: symmetrical (Apex, Mid, Base: 0.69 vs. 0.67 vs. 0.54 respectively, p < 0.05) and asymmetrical (Apex, Mid, Base: 0.68 vs. 0.52 vs. 0.39 respectively, p < 0.05).

Yet it is relatively rare in prostate cancer and no such case has ever been reported in Japanese patients.  Case presentation:   A 54-year-old patient with prostatic adenocarcinoma with bone and lymph node metastases was started on androgen-deprivation therapy. As the prostate cancer turned castration-resistant, multimodal therapies including taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy, androgen-receptor antagonist inhibitors, radiotherapy and radium-233 were introduced. Good controls of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and bone metastases were achieved for more than 13 years since after the initial treatment. During the treatment, a metastatic lymph node biopsy was performed to confirm the tumor histology, and spinal decompression surgery were performed for spinal compression due to lumber vertebral metastases. The immunohistochemical analysis identified PSA and androgen receptor positive tumor cells in both metastatic lesions, while no variable cancer cells were detected in the prostate on second biopsy. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on the biopsied metastatic lymph node in search for another possible treatment and it revealed that the tumor had WGD and CDK12 mutation. The WGD-positive tumor cells contained large and polymorphic nucleus, presumably reflecting on the ploidy abnormality of the chromosomes.

Here, based on two independent datasets, we modelled an mtDNA mutation-cancer network by systematic integrative analysis including 37 cancer types to identify the mitochondrial variants found in common among them.  Results:   Our network showed mtDNA associations between gastric cancer and other cancer types, particularly kidney, liver, and prostate cancers, which is suggestive of a potential role of such variants in the metastatic processes among these cancer types. A graph-based interactive web tool was made available at www2.lghm.ufpa.br/mtdna. We also highlighted that most shared variants were in the MT-ND4, MT-ND5 and D-loop, and that some of these variants were nonsynonymous, indicating a special importance of these variants and regions regarding cancer progression, involving genomic and epigenomic alterations.

We evaluated the impact of OCM on appropriate use of supportive care medications during cancer treatment.  Methods:   We evaluated chemotherapy episodes assigned to OCM (n = 201) and comparison practices (n = 534) using Medicare claims (2013-2019). We assessed denosumab use for beneficiaries with bone metastases from breast, lung, or prostate cancer; prophylactic WBC growth factor use for beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy for breast, lung, or colorectal cancer; and prophylactic use of neurokinin-1 (NK1) antagonists and long-acting serotonin antagonists for beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy for any cancer type. Analyses used a difference-in-difference approach.  Results:   After its launch in 2016, OCM led to a relative reduction in the use of denosumab for beneficiaries with bone metastases receiving bone-modifying medications (eg, 5.0 percentage point relative reduction in breast cancer episodes [90% CI, -7.1 to -2.8]). There was no OCM impact on use of prophylactic WBC growth factors during chemotherapy with high or low risk for febrile neutropenia. Among beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy with intermediate febrile neutropenia risk, OCM led to a 7.6 percentage point reduction in the use of prophylactic WBC growth factors during breast cancer episodes (90% CI, -12.6 to -2.7); there was no OCM impact in lung or colorectal cancer episodes. Among beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy with high or moderate emetic risk, OCM led to reductions in the prophylactic use of NK1 antagonists and long-acting serotonin antagonists (eg, 6.0 percentage point reduction in the use of NK1 antagonists during high emetic risk chemotherapy [90% CI, -9.0 to -3.1]).

However, the role of circRNA midline-1 (circMID1) in prostate cancer (PCa) progression has not been clarified. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure relative expression. Function analysis was performed using EdU staining, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, wound healing assay, transwell assay and cell glycolysis detection. The protein levels were detected by Western blot analysis. RNA pull-down assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to verify RNA interaction. Animal experiments were utilized to explore the effects of circMID1 knockdown on PCa tumorigenesis in vivo. Our results showed that circMID1 was upregulated in PCa tissues and cells and its knockdown inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis in vitro, as well as PCa tumorigenesis in vivo. IGF1R and YTHDC2 were highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells, and their expression was positively regulated by circMID1. IGF1R and YTHDC2 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of circMID1 silencing on PCa cell progression. In terms of mechanism, circMID1 could sponge miR-330-3p and miR-330-3p could target IGF1R and YTHDC2. Functional experiments showed that circMID1 sponged miR-330-3p to regulate PCa progression via the YTHDC2/IGF1R/AKT axis.

The oncologic risk of such tumors can be explored by looking at long-term outcomes of men with negative TRUS biopsy followed without MRI. The aim was to analyze the mortality after initial and second negative TRUS biopsy.  Materials and methods:   All men who underwent initial TRUS biopsies between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2016 in Denmark were included. A total of 37,214 men had a negative initial TRUS biopsy and 6,389 underwent a re-biopsy. Risk of cause-specific mortality was analyzed with competing risks. Diagnosis of Gleason score ≥7 prostate cancer following negative biopsies was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression including time to re-biopsy, prostate specific antigen (PSA), age and digital rectal examination.  Results:   The 15-year prostate cancer-specific mortality was 1.9% (95% CI: 1.7-2.1). Prostate cancer-specific mortality was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.9-1.6) and 4.6% (95% CI: 3.4-5.8) for men with PSA <10 and >20 ng/ml, respectively. Of the TRUS re-biopsies 12% were Gleason score ≥7 and risk of Gleason score ≥7 increased with longer time to re-biopsy (p <0.001). Mortality after re-biopsy was similar to after initial biopsy.  Conclusions:   Men with negative TRUS biopsies have a very low prostate cancer-specific mortality, especially with PSA <10 ng/ml. This raises serious questions about the routine use of MRI targeting for initial prostate biopsy and suggests that MRI targeting should only be recommended for men with PSA >10 ng/ml after negative biopsy.""","""['Sandra Miriam Kawa', 'Hein Vincent Stroomberg', 'Signe Benzon Larsen', 'John Thomas Helgstrand', 'Birgitte Grønkær Toft', 'Andrew Julian Vickers', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Martin Andreas Røder']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['A Nationwide Analysis of Risk of Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Mortality following an Initial Negative Transrectal Ultrasound Biopsy with Long-Term Followup.

Management has shifted toward active surveillance (AS), yet an optimal regimen remains controversial especially regarding expensive multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We aimed to assess cost-effectiveness of MRI in AS protocols.  Materials and methods:   A probabilistic microsimulation modeled individual patient trajectories for men diagnosed with low-risk cancer. We assessed no surveillance, up-front treatment (surgery or radiation), and scheduled AS protocols incorporating transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy or MRI based regimens at serial intervals. Lifetime quality-adjusted life-years and costs adjusted to 2020 US$ were used to calculate expected net monetary benefit at $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Uncertainty was assessed with probabilistic sensitivity analysis and linear regression metamodeling.  Results:   Conservative management with AS outperformed up-front definitive treatment in a modeled cohort reflecting characteristics from a multi-institutional trial. Biopsy decision conditional on positive imaging (MRI triage) at 2-year intervals provided the highest expected net monetary benefit (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $44,576). Biopsy after both positive and negative imaging (MRI pathway) and TRUS biopsy based regimens were not cost-effective. MRI triage resulted in fewer biopsies while reducing metastatic disease or cancer death. Results were sensitive to test performance and cost. MRI triage was the most likely cost-effective strategy on probabilistic sensitivity analysis.  Conclusions:   For men with low-risk prostate cancer, our modeling demonstrated that AS with sequential MRI triage is more cost-effective than biopsy regardless of imaging, TRUS biopsy alone or immediate treatment.

Methods: Human normal prostate cells and PCa cells were used to detect the expressions of miR-103a-3p and TRIM66 and analyze their relationship. DTX-resistant (DR) PCa cells were established and transfected with miR-103a-3p and TRIM66 plasmids. The MTT assay, the plate cloning assay, the wound healing assay, and the Transwell assay were used to detect cell viability, colony formation, cell migration, and cell invasion, respectively. Cell glycolysis was analyzed using a cell glycolysis kit. Results: The expression of miR-103a-3p was low and that of TRIM66 was high in PCa cells. MiR-103a-3p had a binding site with TRIM66, and the double luciferase report confirmed that they had a targeting relationship. Compared with the PCa group cells, the DTX-resistant group cells showed increased resistance to DTX. The resistance index was 13.33, and the doubling time of the DTX-resistant group cells was significantly longer than that of the PCa group cells. The DTX-resistant group showed more obvious low expression of miR-103a-3p and high expression of TRIM66. After the DTX-resistant group cells were transfected with miR-103a-3p and TRIM66 plasmids, the expression of miR-103a-3p increased significantly and that of TRIM66 decreased significantly. Upregulation of miR-103a-3p and interference with TRIM66 can inhibit the proliferation, metastasis, and glycolysis of DTX-resistant cells. Conclusion: The expression of miR-103a-3p was downregulated and that of TRIM66 was upregulated in the malignant progression of PCa, especially during DTX resistance.

We report safety and efficacy results from the advanced non-clear cell RCC (nccRCC) cohort of CheckMate 920.  Methods:   Patients with previously untreated advanced/metastatic nccRCC, Karnofsky performance status ≥70%, and any International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium risk received up to four doses of nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks followed by nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks for ≤2 years or until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was incidence of grade ≥3 immune-mediated adverse events (AEs) within 100 days of last dose of study drug. Key secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS; both investigator-assessed), time to response (TTR), and duration of response (DOR), all using RECIST V.1.1. Overall survival (OS) was exploratory.  Results:   Fifty-two patients with nccRCC (unclassified histology, 42.3%; papillary, 34.6%; chromophobe, 13.5%; translocation-associated, 3.8%; collecting duct, 3.8%; renal medullary, 1.9%) received treatment.

Relative margin deficiencies may relate to efficacy and margin excesses to post-implant toxicity. Our purpose is to determine MRI-defined treatment margins on prostate achieved with LDR brachytherapy.  Methods and materials:   Post implant CT and MR images from 487 consecutive patients who received LDR brachytherapy from 2010 to 14 were co-registered. Four prostate quadrants were defined; anterior-superior (AS), posterior-superior (PS), anterior-inferior (AI), posterior-inferior (PI). Dosimetric variables were measured for prostate, and for each quadrant with a 0-, 2-, 3-, and 5-mm margin, as well as for the membranous urethra defined on MRI.  Results:   Prostate D90 (no margin) was associated with D90 to the volume enclosed by 2 mm, 3 mm and 5 mm margins (R2 = 0.9 - 1.0) with an average 7.1% decrease in dose per mm of margin. Mean D90 for PS, AI and PI quadrants were > 110% of prescription dose for margins of 2-, 3-, and 5-mm. AS quadrant mean D90s were generally lower (83.2% for 2 mm, 76.4% for 3 mm and 62.2% for 5 mm). Urethral strictures (n = 9) were associated with higher doses in the AI quadrant, and higher membranous urethral V125 (51 vs. 32%, p 0.013) and V150 (34.5 vs. 17.6%, p 0.01).  Conclusions:   Using MR-CT post implant dosimetry, margin coverage up to 5 mm was excellent with less margin coverage in the AS quadrant. Late ≥ grade 2 toxicity and urinary strictures are more likely to occur with relative margin excess in the anterior-inferior quadrant and higher doses caudal to the prostate apex.

Enzalutamide (MDV3100) can prolong the survival of patients with CRPC after chemotherapy, but ∼50% of patients eventually relapse and develop resistance to MDV3100. Thus, it is necessary to explore new treatment methods to improve the therapeutic effect of MDV3100. Tyrosine kinases play an essential role in the pathogenesis of CRPC. Methods: MTT assay was used to detect the inhibitory effects of MDV3100 and tyrosine kinase inhibitor on prostate cancer cells. CompuSyn version 1.0 was used to calculate the combination index (CI) values using the Chou-Talalay method. Clone formation and EdU assay were used to detect the effect of afatinib combined with MDV3100 on the proliferation of 22Rv1 cells. RT-qPCR and Western blot were used to explore the mechanism of drug combination. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) when used in combination with MDV3100 in vitro. Results: The results demonstrated that TKIs combined with MDV3100 exerted a synergistic effect on a variety of PCa cells. Afatinib combined with MDV3100 could suppress the proliferation and migration of 22RV1 cells, as well as cause their cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, afatinib effectively reduced the protein expression levels of HER2 and HER3 and inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, thereby enhancing the effect of MDV3100 and suppressing CRPC. Conclusions: These findings suggested that afatinib treatment improved the effect of MDV3100 on 22RV1 cells, highlighting this drug as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with CRPC.""","""['Jianhua Li', 'Huanxian Wu', 'Shidong Lv', 'Dongling Quan', 'Danni Yang', 'Jiahuan Xu', 'Boyu Chen', 'Baofang Ou', 'Shaoyu Wu', 'Qiang Wei']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pharmazie""","""['Natural killer cells suppress enzalutamide resistance and cell invasion in the castration resistant prostate cancer via targeting the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7).', 'Combination of sorafenib and enzalutamide as a potential new approach for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Galectin-3 Is Implicated in Tumor Progression and Resistance to Anti-androgen Drug Through Regulation of Androgen Receptor Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.']"""

In this work, different parts from Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng were selected to perform cytotoxic screening against human prostate cancer (PC-3) cells. Chromatographic separation and purification were performed for the main constituents of the most effective extract. The content of the fatty acids was determined by Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID). Chemical structural elucidation was performed by spectroscopic means. For the mechanism of the apoptotic induction of the most effective extract, the characteristics were evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining, sub-G1 peak analysis, JC-1 staining, and Western blotting. As a result, extracts from different parts of M. cochinchinensis significantly inhibited cancer cell viability. The most effective stem extract induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells by causing nuclear fragmentation, increasing the sub-G1 peak, and changing the mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, the stem extract increased the pro-apoptotic (caspase-3 and Noxa) mediators while decreasing the anti-apoptotic (Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) mediators. The main constituents of the stem extract are α-spinasterol and ligballinol, as well as some fatty acids.

Our analysis revealed that AA PCa, overall, have more DNA damage than EA PCa. Increased uracil and pyrimidine lesions occurred in AA tumors, while EA tumors had more oxidative lesions. AA PCa have higher levels of UMP and folate cycle metabolites than their EA counterparts. AA PCa showed higher levels of UNG, the uracil-specific glycosylase, than EA, despite uracil lesions being retained within the genome.

Here, we demonstrate that HMA is similarly cytotoxic toward breast CSC-related subpopulations that are resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but poorly cytotoxic toward normal mammary stem cells. HMA inhibits the sphere-forming capacity of FACS-sorted human and mouse mammary CSC-related cells in vitro, specifically kills tumor but not normal mammary organoids ex vivo, and inhibits metastatic outgrowth in vivo, consistent with CSC suppression. Moreover, HMA inhibits viability and sphere formation by lung, colon, pancreatic, brain, liver, prostate, and bladder tumor cell lines, suggesting that its effects may be applicable to multiple malignancies.

It creates an inflammatory microenvironment favouring the initiation and progression of various age-related diseases, including prostate cancer. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of cellular gene expression. Nonetheless, very little is known about the interplay of microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and how deregulation of ncRNA networks promotes cellular senescence. To investigate this, human prostate epithelial cells were cultured through different passages until senescent, and their RNA was extracted and sequenced using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq) miRNAseq. Differential expression (DE) gene analysis was performed to compare senescent and proliferating cells with Limma, miRNA-target interactions with multiMiR, lncRNA-target interactions using TCGA data and network evaluation with miRmapper. We found that miR-335-3p, miR-543 and the lncRNAs H19 and SMIM10L2A all play central roles in the regulation of cell cycle and DNA repair processes. Expression of most genes belonging to these pathways were down-regulated by senescence.

This study aims to investigate the expression of HAVcR-1 in prostate cancer samples and the exploration of the cellular/molecular impact of HAVcR-1.  Methods:   Levels of HAVcR-1 ectodomain in the serum of prostate cancer patients were compared to healthy controls, and assessed as the total protein and gene expression of HAVcR-1 and tissues sections. The manipulation of HAVcR-1 levels within prostate cancer cell lines determined changes in cell behaviour using in vitro cell models and barrier function assays. Protein/phosphoprotein levels were assessed using Western blotting.  Results:   Levels of HAVcR-1 ectodomain from serum were decreased in patients with prostate cancer. Ectodomain levels correlated with the Gleason score. Histologically, the total protein/gene expression of HAVcR-1 was overexpressed in prostate cancer. The overexpression of HAVcR-1 in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in key changes in cell behaviour and the phosphorylation of β-catenin with a concurrent decrease in membranous E-cadherin, increased nuclear β-catenin and increased cyclin D1 protein expression, which were associated with HGF-promoted changes in the barrier function.

Androgen deprivation is the first-line therapy for mPCa; however, resistance to therapy inevitably occurs and the disease progresses to the castration resistant stage, which is uncurable. A definition of novel targeted therapies is necessary for the establishment of innovative and more effective protocols of personalized oncology. We employed genetically engineered mouse models of PCa and human samples to characterize the expression of the TRPM8 cation channel in both hormone naïve and castration resistant tumors. We show that Trpm8 expression marks both indolent (Pten-null) and aggressive (Pten/Trp53 double-null and TRAMP) mouse prostate adenocarcinomas. Importantly, both mouse and human castration-resistant PCa preserve TRPM8 protein expression. Finally, we tested the effect of TRPM8 agonist D-3263 administration in combination with enzalutamide or docetaxel on the viability of aggressive mouse PCa cell lines. Our data demonstrate that D-3263 substantially enhances the pro-apoptotic activity of enzalutamide and docetaxel in TRAMP-C1 e TRAMP-C2 PCa cell lines.

Here we found that pirin is overexpressed in human colorectal cancer in comparison with matched normal tissue. The overexpression of pirin correlates with activation of transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased expression of the classical Nrf2 target NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), but interestingly and unexpectedly, not with expression of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family members AKR1B10 and AKR1C1, which are considered to be the most overexpressed genes in response to Nrf2 activation in humans. Using pharmacologic and genetic approaches to either downregulate or upregulate Nrf2, we show that pirin is regulated by Nrf2 in human and mouse cells and in the mouse colon in vivo. The small molecule pirin inhibitor TPhA decreased the viability of human colorectal cancer (DLD1) cells, but this decrease was independent of the levels of pirin.

The neighborhood-level factors including socioeconomic disadvantage and lack of access to care may contribute to disparities in cancer mortality. This study examines the impact of neighborhood deprivation on mortality among PCa survivors.  Methods:   North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) data were used. A total of 2113 men, 1046 AA and 1067 EA, with PCa were included in the analysis. Neighborhood deprivation was measured by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) at the census block group level using data from the US Census Bureau. Quintiles of ADI were created. Cox proportional hazards and competing risk models with mixed effects were performed to estimate the effect of neighborhood deprivation on all-cause and PCa-specific mortality adjusted for age, race, study site, insurance status, and comorbidities.  Results:   Participants living in the most deprived neighborhoods had an increased risk for all-cause mortality (quintiles 4 + 5: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-1.96) compared to those in the least deprived (quintile 1) neighborhoods. The risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality was also higher among those living in the deprived neighborhoods (quintiles 4 + 5: aHR = 1.90, 95% CI = 1.10-3.50) than those in the least deprived neighborhood.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the cost-effectiveness of exercise in preventing falls and fractures for this high-risk population in Australia.  Methods:   A decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate the cost utility of an exercise intervention compared to usual care from a health system perspective. The intervention comprised two 1-h sessions of supervised exercise per week over 1 year for men with non-metastatic PCa receiving curative radiation therapy and ADT. A Markov model simulated the transition between five health states: (1) at risk of falling; (2) at recurrent risk of falling; (3) fracture (minor or major); (4) non-fracture injury (minor or major); and (5) death. Model inputs including transition probabilities and utility scores were obtained from published meta-analyses, and costs were drawn from Australian data sources (e.g. Medical Benefits Schedule). The model time horizon was 3 years, and costs and effects were discounted at 5% annual rate. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were aggregated and compared between the intervention and control to calculate incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB). Uncertainty in the results was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA).

Results:   The median patient age was 63 years (interquartile range (IQR) 58-67 years) and median PSA was 6.5 ng/mL (IQR 5.0-10.0 ng/mL). Extracapsular extension was present in 85/133 (63.9%) patients and SVI was present in 22/133 (16.5%) patients.

Hypothesizing that such changes might confer an advantage to tumor cells, we aimed at the identification of commercially available compounds to guide further mechanistic studies. We therefore screened for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved compounds that reverse the direction of characteristic tumor nuclear size changes in PC3, HCT116, and H1299 cell lines reflecting, respectively, prostate adenocarcinoma, colonic adenocarcinoma, and small-cell squamous lung cancer. Results: We found distinct, largely nonoverlapping sets of compounds that rectify nuclear size changes for each tumor cell line. Several classes of compounds including, e.g., serotonin uptake inhibitors, cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, β-adrenergic receptor agonists, and Na+/K+ ATPase inhibitors, displayed coherent nuclear size phenotypes focused on a particular cell line or across cell lines and treatment conditions. Several compounds from classes far afield from current chemotherapy regimens were also identified. Seven nuclear size-rectifying compounds selected for further investigation all inhibited cell migration and/or invasion. Conclusions: Our study provides (a) proof of concept that nuclear size might be a valuable target to reduce cell migration/invasion in cancer treatment and (b) the most thorough collection of tool compounds to date reversing nuclear size changes specific to individual cancer-type cell lines.

Oftentimes, two screening tests for a specific disease are compared in order to determine an optimal screening policy, for example, the digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level for screening prostate cancer. Ideally, if a gold standard test is given to each individual being screened to establish their true disease status, the difference in accuracy measures between two tests can be evaluated. In practice, however, it is common that only individuals who test positive on at least one screening test are to receive gold standard tests, which are often invasive and cannot be applied to those with negative results on both tests due to ethical reasons. Under such circumstances, estimates of the differences in accuracy measures between two tests cannot be determined, thus the inference problem within this framework is challenging. In this article, using sensitivity and specificity as measures of test accuracy, we show that their difference between two tests is interval-identified, as bounded by estimable sharp bounds. Here, we develop the asymptotic normality for the estimators of the bounds and construct confidence intervals for the difference by utilizing the method for solving inference problem for partially identified parameters. The performance of constructed confidence intervals for the difference and their sharp bounds are evaluated via simulation studies. We also apply the proposed method to the prostate cancer example to compare the accuracy of DRE and PSA.""","""['Lu Wang', 'Xiao-Hua Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Digital rectal examination in primary care is important for early detection of prostate cancer: a retrospective cohort analysis study.', 'An evaluation of usefulness of prostate specific antigen and digital rectal examination in the diagnosis of prostate cancer in an unscreened population:experience in a Nigerian teaching hospital.', 'Notes on testing non-inferiority under the partial verification design with a confirmatory procedure limited to screen positives.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in U.S. men ACPM position statement on preventive practice.']"""

In this study, we develop an advanced method, GATGCN, using graph attention network (GAT) and graph convolutional network (GCN) to detect potential circRNA-disease relationships. First, several sources of biomedical information are fused via the centered kernel alignment model (CKA), which calculates the corresponding weight of different kernels. Second, we adopt the graph attention network to learn latent representation of diseases and circRNAs. Third, the graph convolutional network is deployed to effectively extract features of associations by aggregating feature vectors of neighbors. Meanwhile, GATGCN achieves the prominent AUC of 0.951 under leave-one-out cross-validation and AUC of 0.932 under 5-fold cross-validation.

However it is still a challenge to early diagnose it since no reliable examination could be done except PSA, which has high variability. It is now known that miRNAs are involved in nearly all inflammatory responses. Several malignancies in humans that specifically express miRNA have been detected and identified. The expression values of miRNA-21 also correlates with the occurrence of resistant castration of prostate cancer and metastases, therefore miRNA-21 is expected to be a biomarker to estimate the progression of cancer.  Objective:   The purpose of this study was to analyze the expression values and cut-off markers of miRNA-21 as markers of CRPC progression.  Methods:   This study used a retrospective cohort design with observational analysis. The forty-eight total sample was obtained from serum, then the RT-PCR was performed to obtain expression values of miRNA-21. Data were analyzed using One Way ANOVA to see the difference in the expression values of miRNA-21. Furthermore, to determine the cut-off analysis was carried out using the ROC curve.  Results:   In the BPH group, an average expression value of miRNA-21 was 33,785±1.80 ng/dL, in the Prostate cancer group the average miRNA-21 was 34.51±1.32 ng/dL, while in the CRPC group, an average miRNA-21 was obtained, reaching to 34.51±1.32 ng/dL.

This study examined the real-world utilization of docetaxel in these patients and their outcomes.  Methods:   A retrospective population-based study used administrative data from Ontario, Canada, to identify men aged ≥66 years who were diagnosed with de novo mCSPC or mCRPC between 2014 and 2019 and received docetaxel. The study assessed treatment tolerability and toxicity, and survival in both cohorts. Descriptive and comparative statistical analysis were conducted.  Results:   The study identified 11.2% (399/3556) and 13.2% (203/1534) patients diagnosed with de novo mCSPC and with mCRPC who received docetaxel respectively. The median age in both cohorts was 72 years (IQR: 68-76). Overall, 43.9% (n = 175) patients with de novo mCSPC and 52.1% (n = 85) with mCRPC completed ≥6 cycles of docetaxel. Over two-fifth also needed dose adjustments in both cohorts. Hospitalization or emergency department visit for febrile neutropenia were noted in 15.8% (n = 63) of de novo mCSPC patients and similarly in 19% (n = 31) of mCRPC cohort.

Methods:   We conducted a biochemical analysis of 29,102 male Finnish smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Serum α-tocopherol was measured at baseline using high-performance liquid chromatography, and 2724 prostate cancer cases were identified during 28 years of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models examined whether serum α-tocopherol concentrations were associated with prostate cancer risk. Among 8383 participants, three SNPs related to vitamin E status (rs964184, rs2108622, and rs11057830) were examined to determine whether they modified the relationship between serum α-tocopherol concentrations and prostate cancer risk, both individually and as a PRS using logistic regression models.  Results:   No association was observed between serum α-tocopherol and prostate cancer risk (fifth quintile (Q5) vs. Q1 hazard ratio (HR) = 0.87, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.75, 1.02; P-trend = 0.57). Though no interactions were seen by population characteristics, high α-tocopherol concentration was associated with reduced prostate cancer risk among the trial α-tocopherol supplementation group (Q5 quintile vs. Q1 HR = 0.79, 95% CI 0.64, 0.99). Finally, no associated interaction between the three SNPs or their PRS and prostate cancer risk was observed.  Conclusion:   Although there was a weak inverse association between α-tocopherol concentration and prostate cancer risk over nearly three decades, our findings suggest that men receiving the trial α-tocopherol supplementation who had higher baseline serum α-tocopherol concentration experienced reduced prostate cancer risk.

In this study we took advantage of a recombinant CSPG-binding lectin VAR2CSA (rVAR2) to track internalization and cell fate of CSPGs in tumor cells. We found that rVAR2 is internalized into cancer cells via multiple internalization mechanisms after initial docking on cell surface CSPGs. Regardless of the internalization pathway used, CSPG-bound rVAR2 was trafficked to the early endosomes in an energy-dependent manner but not further transported to the lysosomal compartment. Instead, internalized CSPG-bound rVAR2 proteins were secreted with exosomes to the extracellular environment in a strictly chondroitin sulfate-dependent manner. In summary, our work describes the cell fate of rVAR2 proteins in tumor cells after initial binding to CSPGs, which can be further used to inform development of rVAR2-drug conjugates and other therapeutics targeting CSPGs.""","""['Chris Kedong Wang', 'Irina Nelepcu', 'Desmond Hui', 'Htoo Zarni Oo', 'Sarah Truong', 'Sarah Zhao', 'Zakir Tahiry', 'Shaghayegh Esfandnia', 'Fariba Ghaidi', 'Hans Adomat', 'Robert Dagil', 'Tobias Gustavsson', 'Swati Choudhary', 'Ali Salanti', 'Poul H Sorensen', 'Nader Al Nakouzi', 'Mads Daugaard']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) function as endocytic receptors for an internalizing anti-nucleic acid antibody.', 'Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans of bovine cornea: structural characterization and assessment for the adherence of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes.', 'Plasmodium falciparum: adherence of the parasite-infected erythrocytes to chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans bearing structurally distinct chondroitin sulfate chains.', 'Scar-mediated inhibition and CSPG receptors in the CNS.', 'Molecular mechanisms of scar-sourced axon growth inhibitors.', 'Peptide-Drug Conjugates: A New Hope for Cancer Management.', 'Immunotherapeutic Targeting of NG2/CSPG4 in Solid Organ Cancers.']"""

However, mpMRI pathways are depending on experience, expertise, and information transfer from radiology to urology. Micro-ultrasound (Micro-US) is a new system, using high frequency (up to 29 MHz) and high resolution (down to 75 µm) ultrasound images. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of Micro-US in the detection of the prostate cancer index lesion and compared its performance to mpMRI using pathological whole mount sections as the reference.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the data of 32 patients with diagnosis of prostate cancer and scheduled for radical prostatectomy and who underwent Micro-US before surgery. Still images and cineloops of Micro-US were recorded. Sixteen patients had also mpMRI images with acceptable quality and complete sequences available. For validation purposes each prostate was partitioned into 12 sectors for a total of 192 sectors evaluated. Micro-US and mpMRI images were both scored according to a validated system (PRI-MUS and Pi-RADS) where a score ≥3 was suspicious for both scores. Preoperative and postoperative results regarding the identification of the index lesion, the biggest lesion visible, were then compared and sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values, and accuracy were calculated.  Results:   Median age was 67 years, median PSA was 6.2ng/ml, and median cancer volume of the index lesion was 3.1cc. The sensitivity of Micro-US in the index lesion detection was 76.5%, specificity 76.6%, negative predictive value 85.6%, positive predictive value 64.1% and 76.6% of accuracy. The sensitivity of mpMRI was 65.1%, specificity 93.4%, negative predictive value 83.2%, positive predictive value 84.3%, and 81.8% of accuracy (all p> .05).  Conclusion:   Micro-US showed good reliability in identifying prostate cancer index lesions. Its performance is comparable to that of mpMRI.""","""['Vito Lorusso', 'Boukary Kabre', 'Geraldine Pignot', 'Nicolas Branger', 'Andrea Pacchetti', 'Jeanne Thomassin-Piana', 'Serge Brunelle', 'Andrea Gregori', 'Naji Salem', 'Gennaro Musi', 'Emanuele Montanari', 'Ottavio de Cobelli', 'Gwenaelle Gravis', 'Jochen Walz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['The use of 29 MHz transrectal micro-ultrasound to stratify the prostate cancer risk in patients with PI-RADS III lesions at multiparametric MRI: A single institutional analysis.', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Evolution of Targeted Prostate Biopsy by Adding Micro-Ultrasound to the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pathway.', 'Prostate Indeterminate Lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Biopsy Versus Surveillance: A Literature Review.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'The diagnostic accuracy of micro-ultrasound for prostate cancer diagnosis: a review.', 'Special Issue ""Prostate Cancer: Recent Advances in Diagnostics and Treatment Planning"".']"""

Methods:   Thirty-eight patients who received definitive volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT)-stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer with prostate motion monitoring in our institution in 2018-2019 were retrospectively evaluated. In order to move the rectum away from the prostate, hydrogel spacer (SpaceOAR system, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, the United States) injection was proposed to the patients as an option in case of meeting the indication of use. We monitored intrafractional prostate motion by using a 4-dimensional (4D) transperineal ultrasound device: the Clarity 4D ultrasound system (Elekta AB). The deviation of the prostate was monitored in each direction: superior-inferior, left-right, and anterior-posterior. We also calculated the vector length. The maximum intrafractional displacement (MID) per fraction for each direction was detected and mean of MIDs was calculated per patient. The MIDs in the non-spacer group and the spacer group were compared using the unpaired t-test.  Results:   We reviewed 33 fractions in eight patients as the spacer group and 148 fractions in 30 patients as the non-spacer group. The superior MID was 0.47 ± 0.07 (mean ± SE) mm versus 0.97 ± 0.24 mm (P = 0.014), the inferior MID was 1.07 ± 0.11 mm versus 1.03 ± 0.25 mm (P = 0.88), the left MID was 0.74 ± 0.08 mm versus 0.87 ± 0.27 mm (P = 0.55), the right MID was 0.67 ± 0.08 mm versus 0.92 ± 0.21 mm (P = 0.17), the anterior MID was 0.45 ± 0.06 mm versus 1.16 ± 0.35 mm (P = 0.0023), and the posterior MID was 1.57 ± 0.17 mm versus 1.37 ± 0.22 mm (P = 0.56) in the non-spacer group and the spacer group, respectively. The max of VL was 2.24 ± 0.19 mm versus 2.89 ± 0.62 mm (P = 0.19), respectively.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that maximum intrafractional prostate motion during VMAT-SBRT was larger in patients with hydrogel spacer injection in the superior and anterior directions.

Patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy along with docetaxel result in superior survival, lower serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, and better quality of life. However, a significant proportion of these patients ultimately develop resistance to docetaxel within months. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), one of the main bioactive components extracted from the propolis, has been reported to be effective for repressing the tumor growth, the migration and invasion of prostate cancer (PCa) cells, as well as the downstream signaling and stability of androgen receptor (AR). We hence determined if combination treatment of docetaxel with CAPE can suppress the proliferation and the survival of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells.  Methods:   We established docetaxel-resistant PC/DX25 and DU/DX50 CRPC cell lines from PC-3 and DU-145 human PCa cells, respectively. Proliferation assay, MTT assay, flow cytometry with Annexin V staining, Comet Assay, and nude mice xenograft model were applied to determine the effects of combination treatment on cell proliferation and survival of the docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. Micro-Western Array (MWA) and qRT-PCR were used to investigate the molecular mechanism lying underneath.  Results:   Combination treatment effectively suppressed the proliferation, survival and tumor growth of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells both in vitro and in nude mice. Comet assay and flow cytometry indicated that combination treatment induced apoptosis in docetaxel-resistant PCa cells. MWA and Western blotting assay revealed that combination treatment suppressed protein expression of Bcl-2, AKT2, c-Myc, apoptosis and caspase activation inhibitor (AVEN), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) but increased protein expression of Bax, caspase 3, cytochrome c, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and acylglycerol kinase (AGK). Overexpression of Bcl-2 in the docetaxel-resistant PCa cells enhanced cell proliferation of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells under combination treatment. Analysis with qRT-PCR suggested that combination treatment decreased cholesterol biosynthesis genes DHCR24 (24-dehydrocholesterol reductase) and LSS (lanosterol synthase) but increased genes involved in glycolysis and TCA cycle.  Conclusions:   Combination treatment of docetaxel with CAPE effectively suppressed the proliferation and survival of docetaxel-resistant PCa cells via inhibition of Bcl-2 and c-Myc as well as induction of metabolism interference.

However, for specific cancer sites, the evidence is limited. Our aim was to assess the associations of vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets with risks of all cancer, colorectal cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer, and prostate cancer and to explore the role of potential mediators between these associations.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective analysis of 472,377 UK Biobank participants who were free from cancer at recruitment. Participants were categorised into regular meat-eaters (n = 247,571), low meat-eaters (n = 205,385), fish-eaters (n = 10,696), and vegetarians (n = 8685) based on dietary questions completed at recruitment. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regressions were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all cancer incidence and separate cancer sites across diet groups.  Results:   After an average follow-up of 11.4 years, 54,961 incident cancers were identified, including 5882 colorectal, 7537 postmenopausal breast, and 9501 prostate cancers. Compared with regular meat-eaters, being a low meat-eater, fish-eater, or vegetarian were all associated with a lower risk of all cancer (HR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-1.00; 0.90, 0.84-0.96; 0.86, 0.80-0.93, respectively). Being a low meat-eater was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in comparison to regular meat-eaters (0.91, 0.86-0.96); however, there was heterogeneity in this association by sex (p = 0.007), with an inverse association across diet groups in men, but not in women. Vegetarian postmenopausal women had a lower risk of breast cancer (0.82, 0.68-0.99), which was attenuated and non-significant after adjusting for body mass index (BMI; 0.87, 0.72-1.05); in mediation analyses, BMI was found to possibly mediate the observed association. In men, being a fish-eater or a vegetarian was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer (0.80, 0.65-0.99 and 0.69, 0.54-0.89, respectively).  Conclusion:   The lower risk of colorectal cancer in low meat-eaters is consistent with previous evidence suggesting an adverse impact of meat intake. The lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in vegetarian women may be explained by their lower BMI.

In a previous study, we found that ionizing radiation itself enriches for ALDH-positive CSCs. In this study, we analyze CSC marker dynamics in prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, and glioblastoma cells upon proton beam irradiation. We find that proton irradiation has a higher potential to target CSCs through induction of complex DNA damages, lower rates of cellular senescence, and minor alteration in histone methylation pattern compared with conventional photon irradiation.

While androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective in the initial treatment of prostate cancer, resistance to ADT or to next-generation androgen pathway inhibitors invariably arises, most commonly through the re-activation of the AR axis. Thus, orthogonal approaches to inhibit AR signaling in advanced prostate cancer are essential. Here, via genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening, we identify protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) as a critical mediator of AR expression and signaling.

Given the paucity of data on this topic in urologic oncology, we sought to quantify the enrollment of minority patients in clinical trials studying prostate, kidney, and bladder/urothelial cancers.  Methods:   The ClincialTrials.gov database was queried for completed phase II and III interventional trials in prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers. The SEER database was used to calculate the US prevalence of these genitourinary cancers. Representation quotients (RQ) were calculated to describe the relative proportion of each racial/ethnic group enrolled in clinical trials over the proportion of persons from each group among national cancer cases by cancer type.  Results:   Of 341 trials that met initial eligibility criteria, only 169 (49.7%) reported data on race or ethnicity. Aggregate RQs from 2000 to 2017 showed that White patients were continually over-represented in trials for all cancer types. Black and Asian patients were poorly represented across all cancer types. When stratified by 3-year increments, the RQs remained stable for all races, from 2000 to 2017. When stratified by ethnicity, Hispanic patients were under-represented across all cancer types in the study period. When examining representation by funding source, we found that US government-funded clinical trials proportionally enroll the most diverse patient populations over those funded by academic institutions and industry. Interestingly, more than 50% of the trials examined did not report race nor ethnicity, highlighting a crucial flaw in investigator compliance with federal clinical trial mandates.  Conclusion:   Clinical trials targeting prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers continue to under-represent racial/ethnic minority patients. On the basis of the incidence of these cancers within minority populations, efforts should focus on creating racially and ethnically inclusive cancer research.""","""['Jeunice Owens-Walton', 'Cheyenne Williams', 'Alexis Rompré-Brodeur', 'Peter A Pinto', 'Mark W Ball']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Is representation enough or should we be targeting equitable inclusion?', 'Participation of Patients From Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups in Phase 1 Early Cancer Drug Development Trials in the US, 2000-2018.', 'Enrollment of Individuals From Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups in Gynecologic Cancer Precision Oncology Trials.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities Among Participants in Precision Oncology Clinical Studies.', 'Assessment of the Inclusion of Racial/Ethnic Minority, Female, and Older Individuals in Vaccine Clinical Trials.', 'Twenty years post-NIH Revitalization Act: enhancing minority participation in clinical trials (EMPaCT): laying the groundwork for improving minority clinical trial accrual: renewing the case for enhancing minority participation in cancer clinical trials.', 'Current Status and Future Direction to Address Disparities in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Prostate Cancer Care.', 'Dépistage du cancer de la prostate chez les hommes noirs au Canada : Argument en faveur des soins stratifiés en fonction du risque.', 'Addressing multilevel barriers to clinical trial participation among Black and White men with prostate cancer through the PACCT study.', 'Comparison of Race-Based and Non-Race-Based Glomerular Filtration Rate Equations for the Assessment of Renal Functional Risk Before Nephrectomy.', 'Participation of Patients From Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups in Phase 1 Early Cancer Drug Development Trials in the US, 2000-2018.']"""

Objectives:   This study aims to analyze the phytochemistry and screen the cytotoxic activity of new bioactive compounds against a panel of cancer cells, in addition to proapototic properties against prostate cancer cells.  Method:   Purification procedure was done using repeated column chromatographies by MPLC and HPLC systems. The structures were elucidated by the NMR and exact mass spectroscopy, stereochemistry by NOESY, and absolute configuration by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Cytotoxicity was done against DU 145, LNCaP, HeLa, MCF-7, and MDA-MB 231 cells by standard MTT assay. An annexin V/PI assay was performed to measure the type of death following treatment with these compounds for 48 h, followed by the caspase-3 activity test.  Results:   In this study, one new dilignan named lignopontin A (9), in addition to 13 known compounds including two phenolic acids (3, 5), one flavanone (6), one bis flavonoid (1), one cumarin glycoside (2), one mono (4) and two dicumarins (10, 11), two lignans (7, 8), and three daphnane diterpenoids (12-14) were isolated for the first time from D. pontica stems. Complete spectral data of compound 12, named as 6,7α-epoxy-5β-hydroxy-9,13,14-ortho-(4,2E)-pentadeca-2,4-diene-1-yl)-resiniferonol, and compound 14, named as 6,7α-epoxy-5β-hydroxy-9,3,14-ortho-(2,4E)-pentadeca-2,4-di-1-yl)-resiniferonol-12β-yl-acetate are reported for the first time. In the MTT assay of newly described compounds against a panel of cancer cells, compounds 9, 12, and 14 possessed moderate to potent cytotoxicity against prostate, breast, and cervical cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis against prostate cancer cells indicated that the cytotoxicity of compounds 12 and 14 was due to their ability to induce apoptosis. In the case of compound 9, in Du 145 cells, cell death was mainly through apoptosis. In contrast, LNCaP cells showed both apoptosis and necrotic cell death, predominated by necrosis at the higher concentrations. Caspase-3 activity confirmed apoptosis observed in these compounds through the caspase pathway in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   D. pontica is a new source of dimeric phenolic compounds, including bisflavonoids, phenylpropanoid-cumarin adduct, and dilignans, as well as daphnane diterpenoids with resiniferonol core with long-chain orthoester moieties. In cytotoxicity screening, compounds 9, 12, and 14 inhibited the growth of DU-145 and LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 varied from 0.9 - 27.3 and 25.2 - 87.4 μM, respectively. Among them, 9 exhibited selective growth inhibition against DU 145 treated cells.

The authors investigated whether higher ambient air concentrations of As and Cd are associated with lower overall and PC-specific survival among PC cases in Pennsylvania.  Methods:   Incident PC cases of patients, aged 40 years or older, with a clinical diagnosis and nonmetastatic disease were identified in the 2004 to 2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. Demographic, clinical, and pathologic information were extracted from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. The 3- and 5-year average and cumulative air concentrations of As and Cd were extracted from the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory database. Spatial-temporal hierarchical accelerated failure time models were used to examine the associations between air concentrations of As and Cd and overall and PC-specific survival for the total population and stratified by geographical region defined by rurality and Appalachia status, after adjusting for confounders.  Results:   There were 78,914 PC cases included. Increasing 3- and 5-year average and cumulative air concentrations of As and Cd were significantly associated with lower overall and PC-specific survival among cases, after adjusting for confounders, for the total population, and stratified by geographical region for most of the estimates.  Conclusions:   Data suggest that increasing ambient air exposures to As and Cd may play a role in overall and PC-specific mortality risk among PC cases. Exposures to As and Cd are modifiable and may provide insight into potential strategies to improve PC health outcomes.  Lay summary:   Arsenic and cadmium exposures linked to increased prostate cancer deaths remain unclear. We investigated whether air levels of arsenic and cadmium reported to be released from industries decrease overall and prostate cancer-specific survival among prostate cancer cases identified in the 2004 to 2014 Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. Among the 78,914 prostate cancer cases, increasing air levels of arsenic and cadmium are found to be associated with lower overall and prostate cancer-specific survival for the total population and within rural and urban Appalachia and urban non-Appalachia counties in Pennsylvania.

When human prostate cancer cells stained with PC were imaged using a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope, PC was found to selectively stain the lipid droplets. Under the cell conditions where the formation of droplets was inhibited, PC could be distributed to both the remaining droplets and the intercellular membranes, which could be distinguished based on the fluorescence solvatochromic function of PC. Furthermore, PC efficiently stained normal human skin tissue blocks treated with a transparency-enhancing agent and enabled clear visualization of individual cells in each tissue architecture by means of two-photon fluorescence microscopy (2PM). Interestingly, PC provides bright 2PM images under tissue-penetrative 960 nm excitation, realizing much clearer and deeper tissue imaging than conventional pyrene dyes and NR.

In recent years, anticancer properties of a number of delphinium species were reported, but there is no study on the anticancer effects of Delphinium semibarbatum (D. semibarbatum) alkaloid contents. Therefore, this survey aimed to check the cytotoxicity and apoptotic properties of D. semibarbatum alkaloid fractions (DSAFs) against prostate cancer cells. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay. We examined the apoptosis by detecting annexin V-FITC/PI staining, the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) disruption, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the activity of caspase-3, and expression of the Bax and Bcl-2 in cancer cells. DSAFs treatment inhibited the growth of LNCaP and DU-145 cells by the increase of apoptotic (Q2+Q3) cells detected by annexin V/PI assay. We found over-generation of intracellular ROS and ΔΨm loss in mitochondrial membrane potential treated cell lines. Attenuation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 followed by the increase in pro-apoptotic Bax bands, as well as activation of the caspase-3 enzyme was shown in Western blot analysis.

From each patient, multiple samples were taken from one or more malignant foci, in addition to one sample from benign prostate tissue. Transcriptomic profiles of different malignant foci from the same patient showed a similar level of heterogeneity as tumors from different patients. This applies to expression of genes, fusion genes, and somatic mutations. Within-patient pair-wise analyses identified expression patterns linked to ETS status and extraprostatic extension. A set of 62 genes were found with low intrapatient heterogeneity and high interpatient heterogeneity, retaining stable expression profiles across foci within the same patient. Among these, 16 genes are associated with biochemical recurrence in a separately published study and are therefore nominated as biomarkers with prognostic value regardless of which malignant focus is sampled. In conclusion, an extensive heterogeneity in multifocal prostate cancer is confirmed at the gene expression level.

However, the upstream regulatory mechanism of PrLZ protein stability and its physiological contribution to PCa carcinogenesis remain largely elusive. Here we report that PrLZ can be degraded by SPOP. PrLZ abundance is elevated in SPOP-mutant expressing PCa cell lines and patient specimens. Meanwhile, ERK1/2 might regulate SPOP-mediated PrLZ degradation through phosphorylating PrLZ at Ser40, which blocks the interaction between SPOP and PrLZ. In addition, we identify IL-6 might act as an upstream PrLZ degradation regulator via promoting its phosphorylation by ERK1/2, leading to its impaired recognition by SPOP.

Methods:   This retrospective cohort study included 45,674 low-risk PCa patients who underwent prostatectomy and were not on active surveillance, from National Cancer Database (NCDB). A propensity score matched-pair design was employed, and the final cohort was limited to 1:1 matched 12,340 patients. Gleason score reclassification was used as primary endpoint. As such, any migration to pathologic Gleason score ≥7(3 + 4) was identified as overall, whereas migration to ≥7(4 + 3) was defined as extreme reclassification. A conditional Poisson regression model was used to estimate the risk of reclassification. Whereas spline model was used to estimate the impact of increasing time to treatment as a non-linear function on Gleason reclassification between race group.  Results:   Upon matching there were no differences in the baseline characteristics between race groups. In a matched cohort, higher proportion of low-risk Black men (6.6%) reported extreme reclassification to pathologic Gleason score than White men (5.0%), p < 0.001. In a conditional Poisson regression model adjusted for time to treatment, the risk of overall (RR = 1.09, 95% CI, 1.05-1.13, p < 0.001) and extreme (RR = 1.30, 95% CI, 1.12-1.50, p = 0.004) reclassification was significantly higher in Black men as compared to their White counterpart. In spline model, the probability of Gleason reclassification in Black men was elevated with increasing time to treatment, especially after 180 days (53% vs. 43% between Black and White men).

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an essential role in the pathogenesis of CRC. Therefore, bioinformatics studies on lncRNAs and their target genes have potential importance as novel biomarkers. In the current study, publicly available microarray gene expression data of colorectal cancer (GSE106582) was analyzed with the Limma, Geoquery, Biobase package. Afterward, identified differentially expressed lncRNAs and their target genes were inserted into Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to obtain modules and hub genes. A total of nine differentially expressed lncRNAs (LINC01018, ITCH-IT, ITPK1-AS1, FOXP1-IT1, FAM238B, PAXIP1-AS1, ATP2B1-AS1, MIR29B2CHG, and SNHG32) were identified using microarray data analysis. The WGCNA has identified several hub genes for black (LMOD3, CDKN2AIPNL, EXO5, ZNF69, BMS1P5, METTL21A, IL17RD, MIGA1, CEP19, FKBP14), blue (CLCA1, GUCA2A, UGT2B17, DSC2, CA1, AQP8, ITLN1, BEST4, KLF4, IQCF6) and turquoise (PAFAH1B1, LMNB1, CACYBP, GLO1, PUM3, POC1A, ASF1B, SDCCAG3, ASNS, PDCD2L) modules.

We investigated the associations of obesity and DM in relation to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) PCa risk groups in a racially-diverse patient population.  Patients and methods:   We abstracted demographic and clinical data from men who underwent radical prostatectomy at our institution between 2005 and 2019. Patients were classified into three NCCN PCa risk-groups: low, intermediate and high-risk. Logistic regression models were used to examine the independent and combined associations of body mass index (BMI)/obesity and DM with risks of intermediate and high-risk PCa, adjusting for age and race/ethnicity.  Results:   A total of 1303 men with PCa (average age 60 ± 6.9 years) were analyzed. The majority were non-Hispanic Black (N = 493, 38%) or Hispanic (N = 407, 31%). The prevalence of obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and DM was 29.3% (N = 382) and 28.3% (N = 369), respectively. In multivariate analyses, obesity was independently associated with an odds ratio (OR) = 2.21 of high-risk PCa (95% CI: 1.28-3.81), while DM was associated with an OR = 1.49 (95% CI: 1.05-2.11) of intermediate-risk PCa. Compared to non-obese men without diabetes, men with BMI ≥ 30 and DM had increased risks of both intermediate (OR = 1.93; 95% CI 1.12-3.43) and high-risk PCa (OR = 2.40; 95% CI 1.22-4.73). Interestingly, most of the association of high-risk PCa was driven by obesity.  Conclusion:   In this multiethnic population both obesity and DM were independently associated with intermediate- and high-risk PCa; however, most of the association for high-risk cancer was driven by obesity. Our results corroborate findings that obesity increases the risk of aggressive PCa; however, results regarding DM need to be confirmed in other large multiethnic populations.""","""['Denzel Zhu', 'Michelle Toker', 'William Shyr', 'Ethan Fram', 'Kara L Watts', 'Ilir Agalliu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Effect of diabetes mellitus on high-grade prostate cancer detection among Japanese obese patients with prostate-specific antigen less than 10 ng/mL.', 'The association of diabetes mellitus and high-grade prostate cancer in a multiethnic biopsy series.', 'Diabetes predicts metastasis after radical prostatectomy in obese men: results from the SEARCH database.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer: weighing the evidence.', 'Obesity and prostate cancer: epidemiology and clinical implications.', 'Adipose Tissue-Derived Extracellular Vesicles Contribute to Phenotypic Plasticity of Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

In this study, employing 5-fraction stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to deliver 40 Gy to the prostate clinical target volume (CTV) while boosting the DIL up to 50 Gy was evaluated for patients before and after rectal spacer insertion.  Materials and methods:   24 Computed Tomography (CT) scans of 12 prostate cancer patients with unfavourable intermediate or high risk prostate cancer were employed in this study. At least two treatment plans were generated for each patient to compare pre- and post-spacer insertion plans. Plans were evaluated for target coverage, organs-at-risk doses, and the achievable boost dose level.  Results:   The CTV coverage was significantly better in plans with a spacer, V40Gy 98.4% versus 97.0% (p = 0.012). Using spacers significantly reduced rectal dose in all 12 patients in this study. It was possible to boost DIL to 50 Gy to without violating dose constraints in 6 of 12 patients and to 47.5 Gy in 3 patients post-spacer insertion. For 3 patients (25%) it was not possible to boost DIL above 45 Gy even with a spacer in situ. Without a spacer, for 6 patient (50%) clinically acceptable plan were only achieved when the DIL dose was lowered to 45 Gy. In five of these 6 patients the dose limiting structure was the urethra (urethra planning risk volume V45Gy [cc] ≤ 0.1 cc constraint).  Conclusions:   Clinically acceptable plans for 5 fraction SABR, 40 Gy to the prostate CTV, with a SIB to DIL (45-50 Gy) were achieved. The boost dose achieved was DIL location dependent and primarily affected by DIL's proximity to the urethra. Compared to plans before spacer insertion, higher DIL dose were achieved with spacer in situ for 25% of the patients.

Patients aged ≥65 years with newly-diagnosed PCa, and receiving RT as initial treatment between 2011 and 2015 were identified in the study. Frailty was measured using the multimorbidity frailty index (mFI), categorized as fit, mild frailty, moderate frailty, and severe frailty. Cox regression models were used to examine the association between frailty and mortality.  Results:   Among 4,291 men with a median age of 75 years at PCa diagnosis, 21.87% were categorized as fit, 44.72% were mild frailty, 23.02% were moderate frailty, and 10.42% were severe frailty. With the mean follow-up duration of 4.8 years, patients in the severe frailty group had a significantly higher all-cause mortality risk (HR 1.86; 95% CI, 1.48-2.32) and cancer-specific mortality risk (HR 1.44; 95% CI, 1.05-1.98) than patients in the fit group, whereas no such association was found in the mild frailty group after adjustment.  Conclusions:   This is the first population-based cohort study to evaluate the feasibility of mFI on mortality of PCa patients treated with RT. We found that severe frailty was associated with a higher risk of both all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality.""","""['Yi-Ying Pan', 'Lin-Chieh Meng', 'Ho-Min Chen', 'Liang-Kung Chen', 'Fei-Yuan Hsiao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Arch Gerontol Geriatr""","""['Geriatrics.', 'Development of frailty index using ICD-10 codes to predict mortality and rehospitalization of older adults: An update of the multimorbidity frailty index.', 'Predicting mortality and hospitalization of older adults by the multimorbidity frailty index.', 'Comparisons Between Hypothesis- and Data-Driven Approaches for Multimorbidity Frailty Index: A Machine Learning Approach.', 'Combined Effects of Frailty and Polypharmacy on Health Outcomes in Older Adults: Frailty Outweighs Polypharmacy.', 'Social inequalities in multimorbidity, frailty, disability, and transitions to mortality: a 24-year follow-up of the Whitehall II cohort study.', 'Should clinical trials about prostate cancer assess the frailty as an endpoint?']"""

Treatment success and survival rates are not high enough with current approaches. Therefore, there is a need to develop new agents and treatment methods. Boric acid is the most frequently observed form of boron. Some epidemiological data suggest that environmental exposure to boric acid reduces the incidence of prostate cancer in men, cervical and lung cancers in women. Experimental studies show, boric acid reduces cell proliferation and stimulates apoptosis in some prostate, melanoma, breast cancer cell lines. In this study, it was investigated whether boric acid could be a new candidate molecule that could be used in the treatment of colon cancer.  Materials and methods:   The effects of boric acid on human colon adenocarcinoma cell line SW-480 were investigated with BrdU, TUNEL, Caspase-3, and AIF immunohistochemical studies in both 2D and 3D culture systems. In addition, a qRT-PCR study was carried out to determine the expression changes in key genes that take part in apoptosis.  Results:   We observed that boric acid suppresses cell proliferation and induces apoptosis both in 2D and 3D culture conditions. In addition, as a result of qRt-PCR studies, it was revealed that the observed apoptotic process was related to the TNF signaling pathway.  Conclusion:   Boric acid can be considered as a potential anti-cancer agent candidate for colon cancer treatment.

The use of potent targeted therapies in cancers has led to the development of highly aggressive carcinoma, including neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Although metabolic reprogramming has been reported to be essential for tumor growth and energy production, the relationship between metabolic reprogramming and lineage differentiation which can cause hormone therapy resistance has never been reported in prostate cancer (PCa). Moreover, as there is still no efficient therapy for NEPC, it is urgent to reverse this lineage differentiation during the hormone therapy. Here for the first time, we used in vitro and in vivo human PCa models to study the effect of metabolic reprogramming on the lineage differentiation from the androgen receptor (AR)-dependent adenocarcinoma to AR-independent NEPC. This lineage differentiation leads to antiandrogen drug resistance and tumor development. This phenotype is enabled by the loss of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), the gate for mitochondrial pyruvate influx, and can be reversed by MPC overexpression. Morphologic and cellular studies also demonstrate that the pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) involved epithelium-mesenchymal transition process mediated this lineage alteration. Its inhibition is a potential treatment for MPC-lo tumors. All of these results suggest that metabolic rewiring can act as a starter for increased cellular plasticity which leads to antiandrogen therapy resistance through lineage differentiation.

Methods:   We conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal effects of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) on six common cancers. For exposure data, 221 genetic variants associated with the predicted volume of VAT in 325 153 Europeans from UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Genetic association data of six common cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancers) were obtained from large-scale consortia with an average of 19 576 cases and 43 272 controls. We performed univariable MR with five MR methods [inverse-variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression, weighted median, MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier (MR-PRESSO) and Radial MR] and multivariable MR to estimate the effect of VAT independent of body mass index (BMI). Finally, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses as validation of primary MR results.  Results:   Two associations survived the false discovery rate correction for multiple testing (q-value < 0.05): in IVW, the odds ratios (95% CIs) per unit increase in genetically determined VAT were 1.65 (1.03 to 2.62) for pancreatic cancer and 1.47 (1.20 to 1.82) for lung squamous-cell carcinoma, respectively, which showed the same directions and overlapped confidence intervals with MR-Egger regression and weighted median results. There were no outlier variants identified by MR-PRESSO and no evidence supporting the presence of heterogeneity and pleiotropy in sensitivity analyses, although with wider confidence intervals that included the null, multivariable MR results for these two cancers showed the same directions and similar effect sizes as in IVW, which were independent of the effect from BMI. There was no evidence for a causal effect of VAT on the risk of other types of cancer.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the Tenascin C expression in prostate cancer and its correlation to glycolysis-related protein and gene expression, clinicopathological parameters, and survival of patients.  Methods:   We performed immunohistochemical staining for Tenascin C in 141 cases of primary prostate cancer. Based on public data sets, we explored the association of Tenascin C with angiogenesis-related genes, M2 macrophage-related gene, androgen receptor levels, PI3K/AKT/NF-κB pathway genes, and glycolytic enzyme expression. The glucose uptake, lactate production, and glycolytic enzyme levels were detected by glycolysis assay and western blotting.  Results:   Our results showed that Tenascin C expression is upregulated in prostate cancer tissues compared with benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. High Tenascin C expression in prostate cancer cells was positively associated with lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage, the expression of CD105, CD206, and androgen receptor levels. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant association of Tenascin C expression with the patient's overall survival. Tenascin C expression was positively associated with PI3K p85, pAKT-ser308, and NF-κB p65 protein expression in prostate cancer samples. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tenascin C expression inhibited cell glucose uptake, lactate production, and glycolytic-enzyme expression in prostate cancer cells in vitro.

Methods:   Forty-four patients treated for prostate cancer were enrolled into a clinical trial (NCT03238170). Dose-escalated prostate RT plans were manually created for 30 patients with simulated boost volumes using a conventional treatment planning system (TPS) and used to train a hierarchically dense 3D convolutional neural network to rapidly predict RT dose distributions. The network was used to predict rectal doses for 14 unseen test patients, with associated toxicity risks calculated according to published data. All metrics obtained using the network were compared to conventionally planned values.  Results:   The neural network stratified patients with an accuracy of 100% based on optimal rectal dose-volume histogram constraints and 78.6% based on mandatory constraints. The network predicted dose-derived grade 2 rectal bleeding risk within 95% confidence limits of -1.9% to +1.7% of conventional risk estimates (risk range 3.5%-9.9%) and late grade 2 fecal incontinence risk within -0.8% to +1.5% (risk range 2.3%-5.7%).

Methods:   This is a prospective multi-centre cohort yielded from the READT database (Real-life experience of ADT in Asia), in which patients diagnosed of PCa and offered ADT were prospectively recruited since 2016. Chinese patients recruited from Hong Kong were selected and compared to another cohort of newly diagnosed PCa patients in Hong Kong (HK-Cap database), which was collected prospectively and retrieved retrospectively for this study.

Baseline characteristics including pre-treatment comorbidities, medications and tumour characteristics are documented.  Results:   151 patients receiving ADT (from READT database) and 447 patients not receiving ADT (from HK-Cap database) were analysed.

However, data regarding the oncological outcomes of patients who performed PSMA-PET are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of clinically relevant events during follow-up in patients who performed PSMA-PET for BCR after radical treatment.  Materials and methods:   This analysis included consecutive, hormone-sensitive, hormone-free, recurrent PCa patients (HSPC) enrolled through a prospective study. All patients were eligible for salvage therapy, having at least 24 months of follow-up after PSMA-PET. The primary endpoint was the Event-Free Survival (EFS), defined as the time between the PSMA-PET and the date of event/last follow-up. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the EFS curves. EFS was also investigated by Cox proportional hazards regression. Events were defined as death, radiological progression, or PSA recurrence after therapy.  Results:   One-hundred and seventy-six (n = 176) patients were analyzed (median PSA 0.62 [IQR: 0.43-1.00] ng/mL; median follow-up of 35.4 [IQR: 26.5-40.3] months). The EFS was 78.8% at 1 year, 65.2% (2 years), and 52.2% (3 years). Patients experiencing events during study follow-up had a significantly higher median PSA (0.81 [IQR: 0.53-1.28] vs 0.51 [IQR: 0.36-0.80] ng/mL) and a lower PSA doubling time (PSAdt) (5.4 [IQR: 3.7-11.6] vs 12.7 [IQR: 6.6-24.3] months) (p < 0.001) compared to event-free patients. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that PSA > 0.5 ng/mL, PSAdt ≤ 6 months, and a positive PSMA-PET result were associated with a higher event rate (p < 0.01). No significant differences of event rates were observed in patients who received changes in therapy management after PSMA-PET vs. patients who did not receive therapy changes. Finally, PSA > 0.5 ng/mL and PSAdt ≤ 6 months were statistically significant event-predictors in multivariate model (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Low PSA and long PSAdt were significant predictors of longer EFS.

Therefore, generation of evidence for older patients with prostate cancer is a key imperative. The International Society of Geriatric Oncology has produced and updated several guidelines for management of prostate cancer in older men since 2010. Regarding localized prostate cancer, both surgery and radiotherapy are considered as feasible treatment options for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer even in older men, whereas watchful waiting and active surveillance are useful options for a proportion of these patients. With regard to advanced disease, androgen-receptor axis targets and taxane chemotherapy are standard treatment modalities, although dose modification and prevention of adverse events need to be considered. Management strategy for older patients with prostate cancer should take cognizance of not only the chronological age but also psychological and physical condition, socio-economic status and patient preferences. Geriatric assessment and patient-reported health-related quality of life are important tools for assessing health status of older patients with prostate cancer; however, there is a paucity of evidence of the impact of these tools on the clinical outcomes.

By screening all the DUBs, here we reveal that OTUD6A is exclusively amplified and overexpressed in PrCa but not in other cancers, eliciting a prostatic-specific oncogenic role through deubiquitinating and stabilizing c-Myc oncoprotein. Moreover, genetic ablation of OTUD6A efficiently represses prostatic tumorigenesis of both human PrCa cells and the Hi-Myc transgenic PrCa mice, via reversing the metabolic remodeling caused by c-Myc overexpression in PrCa.

This paper presents preclinical characterization of the LAG-3 inhibitor, ieramilimab (LAG525), and phase I data for the treatment of patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors with ieramilimab ±the anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody, spartalizumab.  Methods:   Eligible patients had advanced/metastatic solid tumors and progressed after, or were unsuitable for, standard-of-care therapy, including checkpoint inhibitors in some cases. Patients received ieramilimab ±spartalizumab across various dose-escalation schedules. The primary objective was to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RP2D).  Results:   In total, 255 patients were allocated to single-agent ieramilimab (n=134) and combination (n=121) treatment arms. The majority (98%) had received prior antineoplastic therapy (median, 3). Four patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities in each treatment arm across various dosing cohorts. No MTD was reached. The RP2D on a 3-week schedule was declared as 400 mg ieramilimab plus 300 mg spartalizumab and, on a 4-week schedule (once every 4 weeks; Q4W), as 800 mg ieramilimab plus 400 mg spartalizumab; tumor target (LAG-3) suppression with 600 mg ieramilimab Q4W was predicted to be similar to the Q4W, RP2D schedule. Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 75 (56%) and 84 (69%) patients in the single-agent and combination arms, respectively. Most common TRAEs were fatigue, gastrointestinal, and skin disorders, and were of mild severity; seven patients experienced at least one treatment-related serious adverse event in the single-agent (5%) and combination group (5.8%). Antitumor activity was observed in the combination arm, with 3 (2%) complete responses and 10 (8%) partial responses in a mixed population of tumor types. In the combination arm, eight patients (6.6%) experienced stable disease for 6 months or longer versus six patients (4.5%) in the single-agent arm. Responding patients trended towards having higher levels of immune gene expression, including CD8 and LAG3, in tumor tissue at baseline.  Conclusions:   Ieramilimab was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with spartalizumab. The toxicity profile of ieramilimab in combination with spartalizumab was comparable to that of spartalizumab alone. Modest antitumor activity was seen with combination treatment.

Objective:   To compare the continence, potency, and oncological outcomes between RARP and LRP in the 12-mo follow-up.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this multicentre, randomised, patient-blinded controlled trial, patients referred for radical prostatectomy to four hospitals in Germany were randomly assigned (3:1) to undergo either RARP or LRP.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Continence was assessed as a patient-reported outcome through validated questionnaires. Secondary endpoints included potency and oncological outcomes. Data were statistically analysed by bivariate tests and multivariable models.  Results and limitations:   At 12 mo, follow-up data were available for 701 of 782 patients. Continence at 6 and 12 mo after surgery was better in RARP patients, however no longer statistically significant (p = 0.068 and 0.38, respectively). Patients who were potent at baseline and underwent nerve-sparing surgery reported significantly higher potency after RARP, as defined by the capability to maintain an erection sufficient for intercourse at 3 (p = 0.005), 6 (p = 0.018), and 12 mo (p = 0.013). There were no statistically significant differences in oncological outcomes at 12 mo. It is a limitation that the influence of different anastomotic techniques was not investigated in this study.  Conclusions:   Both LRP and RARP offer a high standard of therapy for prostate cancer patients. However, robotic assistance offers better functional outcomes in specific areas such as potency and early continence in patients who are eligible for nerve-sparing RP.  Patient summary:   We compared outcomes 12 mo after radical prostatectomy between robotic-assisted and conventional laparoscopy. Both methods were equivalent with respect to oncological outcomes.

We aimed to study: 1) the impact of MRI and PSA density (PSAd) at baseline on the final status, and 2) the impact of bio-clinical features during the follow-up on pursuing AS.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective, monocentric study between June 2013 and July 2020, included 99 patients in AS (median follow-up: 19 months [18-92]). All MRI were reviewed by a single radiologist. Lost to follow-up were 17 patients and 6 patients chose treatment by themselves. Treatment was proposed in case of upgrading (≥ GG2) or increasing PCa volume.  Results:   Impact of MRI and PSAd at baseline: Combining PSAd ≤ 0.15 and PIRADS ≤ 3, the probability to remain in AS was 72%. This rate reached 83% when PSAd ≤ 0.10 was associated to normal MRI. During follow-up: One hundred fifty-seven prostatic biopsies (PBx) were performed and 38 (24%) found PCa upgrading. The association between negative MRI and PSAd ≤ 0.10, during follow-up, had an excellent NPV to predict treatment (95%).

Methods:   This study was a retrospective, longitudinal, population-based study of administrative claims data between January 2016 and April 2020. Men ≥ 66 years with mCRPC receiving advanced treatment were included. Patients were indexed on the day they initiated mCRPC treatment and followed up until death or end of study period to assess treatment and survival. Multinomial regression was used to model the association between baseline covariates, treatment and survival.  Results:   Median age was 75 years among the 944 mCRPC patients who received life-prolonging therapies during this time period. Over 90% of patients used an ARAT as a first-line therapy, and 71.5% received only first-line therapy before death or censoring. Of patients that received two or more lines, over 80% received subsequent therapy with a different mechanism of action. Median overall survival was 18.9 months.  Conclusions:   ARATs have become the predominant first-line systemic treatment option for mCRPC patients in recent years. Notably, the majority of patients received only a single line of life-prolonging therapy after developing mCRPC. In keeping with the recognized efficacy-effectiveness gap, real-world outcomes in this cohort appear poorer than in clinical trials.""","""['Bobby Shayegan', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Shawn Malone', 'Ilias Cagiannos', 'Robert J Hamilton', 'Cristano Ferrario', 'Geoffrey T Gotto', 'Naveen S Basappa', 'Scott C Morgan', 'Ricardo Fernandes', 'Christopher Morash', 'Tamim Niazi', 'Krista L Noonan', 'Ricardo Rendon', 'Brendan Osborne', 'Laura Park-Wyllie', 'Katherine F Y Chan', 'Sebastien J Hotte', 'Fred Saad']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['A real-world retrospective analysis of the management of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada from 2010 - 2018.', 'Survival of Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer After Disease Progression on an Androgen Receptor Axis-Targeted Therapy Given in the Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Versus Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Setting.', 'Real-World Effectiveness of Sipuleucel-T on Overall Survival in Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated with Androgen Receptor-Targeting Agents.', 'Identification of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer using administrative health claims and laboratory data.', 'Update on Systemic Prostate Cancer Therapies: Management of Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the Era of Precision Oncology.']"""

Materials and methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results (SEER) (2004-2016), we identified 4685 cN1 PCa patients, of whom 3589 (76.6%) versus 1096 (24.4%) were treated with RP versus RT. After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression models tested the effect of RP versus RT on OM, while cumulative incidence plots and competing-risks regression (CRR) models addressed CSM and OCM between RP and RT patients. All analyses were repeated after the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). For CSM and OCM analyses, the propensity score was used as a covariate in the regression model.  Results:   Overall, RT patients were older, harbored higher prostate-specific antigen values, higher clinical T and higher Gleason grade groups. PSM resulted in two equally sized groups of 894 RP versus 894 RT patients.

The disease is initially treated with methods that inhibit androgen receptor (AR) signal transduction. Laboratory-based and clinical studies have identified alternative pathways that cause the failure of AR signal inhibition and consequent development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling is activated in certain PC patients and promotes the emergence of CRPC, although by as yet incompletely understood mechanisms. We have previously demonstrated that ubiquitous βarrestin1 (βArr1) expression levels are linked to PC progression. Here, we consider the possibility that βArr1 interacts with and activates GR in model CRPC cells.  Methods:   Bioinformatic analysis of tumor xenograft and human PC datasets was used to correlate the expression of βArr1 and GR. Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence microscopy, and subcellular fractionation were used to determine protein expression level and localization. Immunoprecipitation was applied to detect protein-protein interactions. RNA expression levels were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Prostate sphere analysis was used to assess the rate of growth and invasion. The xenograft tumor implantation method was used to determine the tumor growth rate, local invasion, and metastasis.  Results:   Elevated expression of βArr1 positively correlated with increased GR expression and function in CRPC xenograft and in human PC patients. βArr1 is expressed in the cell cytosol and nucleus, and it formed a complex with GR in the nucleus and not cytosol. Depletion of βArr1 in AR-null CRPC cells inhibited GR function and CRPC growth and invasion in both in vitro and in vivo settings.  Conclusions:   βArr1 binds GR that initiates mitogenic signaling cascades involved in the progression of PC to CRPC. The targeting of the βArr1-GR axis may provide a new opportunity to better manage the CRPC disease.""","""['Hamsa Thayele Purayil', 'Yehia Daaka']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Nuclear βArrestin1 regulates androgen receptor function in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The expression of glucocorticoid receptor is negatively regulated by active androgen receptor signaling in prostate tumors.', 'GR silencing impedes the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer through the JAG1/NOTCH2 pathway via up-regulation of microRNA-143-3p.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Interference with the androgen receptor protein stability in therapy-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Prognostic value of β-Arrestins in combination with glucocorticoid receptor in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'Advances in the Current Understanding of the Mechanisms Governing the Acquisition of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Furthermore, the association between PSM and surgical experience was evaluated, adjusting for case mix. A total of 761 consecutive patients were included, 370 treated by the Mentor surgeon, 247 and 144 treated, respectively, by the two Trainees. Mentor and Trainees had similar PSM rates (31.6% vs 28.0% vs 31.3%, p = 0.6). CUSUM charts showed different LC shapes for different PSM locations (postero-lateral, bladder neck, apex, and multifocal/> 3 mm).

The aim of this study was to develop a new prognostic scoring system for higher accuracy of survival prediction in patients with malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC).  Methods:   Data were collected from 89 patients diagnosed with MSCC in 2018-2020. Potential clinical factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate Cox's regression analysis. The selected logistic coefficients were transformed into a prognostic predictive scoring system. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrapping procedure.  Results:   According to multivariate Cox's regression analysis, 9 potential prognostic factors were obtained, i.e. Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte ratio >3.6, breast cancer, lung cancer, other types of cancer (except prostate cancer), male, complete paralysis, spinal metastases in three levels, hypercalcemia, and no further systemic treatment.

Methods:   The cytotoxicity analysis was measured by using MTT assay on HuCCA and BHK-21 cells. Analysis of apoptosis was evaluated by using staining with Hoechst 33342 and quantitative real-time PCR.  Results:   The BA (50-800 µg/mL) significantly reduced the viability of HuCCA cells in a dose-dependent action with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 92.45 µg/mL at 24 h. It also induced apoptosis signaling pathway, such as nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that BA increased p53, Bax and caspase-3 expression whilst it decreased Bcl-2 expression in the HuCCA cells in a dose dependent manner.

Previous work has shown that active targeting of nanobubbles to tumor biomarkers such as the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) significantly prolongs ultrasound signal enhancement, which is a critical feature for successful tumor diagnosis. However, the specific mechanism behind this effect is not well understood, and has not been previously studied in detail. Thus, in the current work, we investigated the process of PMSA- targeted nanobubble transport in tumors across different scales from in vivo whole tumor imaging using high-frequency dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound to intracellular confocal imaging and, molecularly using headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Data demonstrated that, indeed, molecular targeting of nanobubbles to the PSMA biomarker prolongs their tumor uptake and retention across the entire tumor volume, but with variability due to the expected tumor heterogeneity. Importantly, in vitro, the active targeting of NBs results in internalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis into the target cells, and the co-localization with intracellular vesicles (late-stage endosomes/lysosomes) significantly prolongs perfluorocarbon gas retention within the cells. This has not been directly observed previously.

Analysis was performed according to cancer type and level of recurrence risk, with pathologic stage used a proxy for recurrence risk.  Results:   Three hundred thirty-seven patients were prospectively surveyed from 2018 to 2020: 127 (38%) Kid, 134 (40%) Pros, and 76 (23%) Bld. Patients showed satisfaction with provided strategies to combat recurrence anxiety (Kid 86%, Pros 81%, Bld 85%). However, approximately 16% of patients reported wanting, but not receiving, strategies for fear reduction. Most patients reported diagnostic tests were ""Not at All"" burdensome (Kid 86%, Pros 94%, Bld 82%) and disagree that fewer tests would alleviate anxiety (Kid 89%, Pros 91%, Bld 84%). The majority reported an increased sense of worry if there were no cancer follow-ups (Kid 84%, Pros 80%, Kid 81%), and preferred their specialist to their family physician to direct such care (Kid 89%, Pros 91%, Bld 95%). When stratified by recurrence risk, no significant differences existed across cancers in patients' attitudes toward follow-up. However, Pros cancer patients showed a difference in fear of recurrence (""Not at All"" worried about recurrence ≤T2 38%, ≥T3, 19%; P= .04).  Conclusion:   Urology patients appear satisfied with their oncologic follow-up. Sixteen percent of patients sought additional strategies to combat fear, indicating opportunity for improvement.""","""['Sarah A Strausser', 'R Grant Owens', 'Tyler Vu', 'Ellius Kwok', 'Eric W Schaefer', 'Suzanne Boltz', 'Alireza Aminsharifi', 'Matthew Kaag', 'Jay D Raman', 'Suzanne B Merrill']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Patient-initiated follow up affects fear of recurrence and healthcare use: a randomised trial in early-stage endometrial cancer.', ""Patients' views on follow up of colorectal cancer: implications for risk communication and decision making."", 'Fear of recurrence and possible cases of anxiety and depression in orofacial cancer patients.', 'Upper urinary tract recurrence following radical cystectomy for bladder cancer: a meta-analysis on 13,185 patients.', 'Primary percutaneous approach to upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   Eighty-eight patients who underwent robotic radical prostatectomy between 2018-2019 were included. We compared the minimum one-year follow-up results of patients who underwent Rs-RARP or RARP in terms of oncological and functional outcomes. Potency was assessed with the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score and was defined as an erection sufficient for penetration. Continence was defined as the absence of urinary incontinence with no safety pad. Patients were evaluated in the first month of follow-up and subsequently, every three months.  Results:   Forty-six patients in Rs-RARP and 42 patients in the RARP group were enrolled. Catheter removal time was shorter in the Rs-RARP group (12 vs. 14 days, p = 0.001). At the 1st month visit, 41 patients (%89) were continent (no pads) in the Rs-RARP group while 25 patients (%59) were continent in the RARP group (p = 0.001). Patients who underwent Rs-RARP achieved faster recovery of urinary continence (Log-rank, p = 0.001). After one year of follow-up, 43 patients (93%) in Rs-RARP group and 38 patients (90%) in RARP group were continent (p = 0.6). Potency rates were 38.7% in Rs-RARP and 34.4% in RARP group (p = 0.28). There were no cases of biochemical recurrence in any group.  Conclusions:   Rs-RARP is a feasible technique, providing early return of continence. However, overall continence rates were similar at the end of the one-year follow-up.""","""['A Tahra', 'U Tolga Sen', 'R Sobay', 'A İnkaya', 'E Veli Kucuk', 'U Boylu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Retzius-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy versus open retropubic radical prostatectomy: a prospective comparative study with 19-month follow-up.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Thus, we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the current prevalence and prognosis of these histological variants. A total of 780 (3.3%) patients with histological variants and 235834 patients with typical adenocarcinoma were included in the present study. The variants group presented with a more advanced stage than the typical adenocarcinoma group. The results also showed that patients with neuroendocrine (NE) PCa were more likely to have visceral metastases. In prognostic comparison, we found that variants, except for mucinous, had a worse prognosis than typical adenocarcinoma. Moreover, among these variants, we also discovered that NEPCa patients with low prostate-specific antigen level had the worst survival. In contrast, mucinous PCa had similar overall survival to typical adenocarcinoma. PATIENT SUMMARY: We reported follow-up results for prostate cancer (PCa) patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016). We focused on the prognosis of PCa with different histological variants and evaluated the risk factors that were significant in predicting poor prognosis. We suggested that neuroendocrine PCa patients should receive active treatment as soon as possible to improve their prognosis. We still need further studies to identify the role of mucinous PCa in patients' prognosis compared with typical adenocarcinoma.""","""['Jiatong Zhou', 'Jie Ding', 'Jun Qi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A comprehensive review of incidence and survival in patients with rare histological variants of prostate cancer in the United States from 1973 to 2008.', 'Low-serum prostate-specific antigen level predicts poor outcomes in patients with primary neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Mucinous Prostate Cancer Shows Similar Prognosis to Typical Prostate Acinar Carcinoma: A Large Population-Based and Propensity Score-Matched Study.', 'Neuroendocrine Carcinoma as an Independent Prognostic Factor for Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Population-Based Study.', 'Histological patterns, subtypes and aspects of prostate cancer: different aspects, different outcomes.', 'Animal Models and Their Role in Imaging-Assisted Co-Clinical Trials.']"""

DLL3 is overexpressed in CRPC-NE but not in localised prostate cancer or BPH. There are no effective treatments for neuroendocrine differentiated prostate cancer due to a lack of understanding of DLL3 structure and function. The structure of DLL3 is not yet determined using any experimental techniques. Hence, the structure-based drug discovery approach against prostate cancer has not shown great success. In present study, molecular modelling techniques were employed to generate three-dimensional structure of DLL3 and performed its thorough structural analysis. Further, all-atom molecular dynamics simulation was performed to obtain energetically favourable conformation. Further, we used a virtual screening using a library of >13800 phytochemicals from the IMPPAT database and other literature to select the best possible phytochemical inhibitor for DLL3 and identified the top five compounds. Relative binding affinity was calculated using the MM-PBSA approach. ADMET properties of the screened compounds reveal the toxic effect of Gnemonol C. We believe these studied physicochemical properties, functional domain identification, and binding site identification would be very useful to gain more structural and functional insights of DLL3; also, it can be used to infer their pharmacodynamics properties of DLL3 which was recently reported as an important prostate cancer target. The current study also proposes that Ergosterol Peroxide, Dioslupecin A, Mulberrofuran K, and Caracurine V have strong affinities and could serve as plausible inhibitors against DLL3. We believe this study would further help develop better drug candidates against neuroendocrine prostate cancer.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

This journal club reviews the VISION trial in the context of the earlier TheraP trial of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC post docetaxel and androgen pathway inhibition, to provide direction for the real-world application of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. Treatment in the control groups differed significantly between both trials and may have influenced outcomes: TheraP mandated cabazitaxel whereas VISION's design could not allow it. In both trials, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 had a good safety profile, with common adverse events being fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, marrow suppression and diarrhea. Given its efficacy and favorable safety even in heavily pre-treated patients, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 provides hope to mCRPC patients and may be applied to earlier disease stages in future investigations.""","""['Elias Chandran', 'William D Figg', 'Ravi Madan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Ther""","""['177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', '177Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide treatment in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (LuPSMA trial): a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study.', 'Update on radioligand therapy with 177Lu-PSMA for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: clinical aspects and survival effects.', 'Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan: First Approval.', 'Fundamentals of Rhenium-188 Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry.', 'Potential Ophthalmological Side Effects Induced by Anti-Neoplastic Regimens for the Treatment of Genitourinary Cancers: A Review.']"""
