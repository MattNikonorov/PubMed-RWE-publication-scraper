The prostate gland, including both lesions and their microenvironment, may contain more comprehensive information about the PCa. We aimed to investigate the potential of prostate gland radiomic features in identifying Gleason scores (GS) < 7, = 7, and >7.  Methods:   We retrospectively examined preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results, clinical data, and postoperative pathological findings from 489 PCa patients. The three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) radiomic features were extracted from the manually segmented 3D prostate gland and its maximum 2D layer on MRI, respectively. Significant features were selected, and sequence signatures were then developed via multi-class linear regression (MLR) accordingly. Subsequently, 2D and 3D radiomic models were constructed by applying MLR to the combination of the sequence signatures, respectively. The stability of the significant features was discussed by their average ranking in the other 30 random cohorts. Based on our distance matrix algorithm, we generated different regions of interest to simulate the manual segmentation biases and discuss the model's tolerance to them.  Results:   Our 2D model reached a C-index of 0.728 and an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.794 in the validation cohort. The corresponding key features were stable, with an average ranking of the top 8.352% in 30 random cohorts, and the model could tolerate a segmentation boundary deviation of 2 mm without significant performance degradation.  Conclusion:   2D prostate-gland-MRI-based radiomic features showed stable potential in identifying GS.""","""['Lixin Gong', 'Min Xu', 'Mengjie Fang', 'Bingxi He', 'Hailin Li', 'Xiangming Fang', 'Di Dong', 'Jie Tian']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['The Use of MRI-Derived Radiomic Models in Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification: A Critical Review of Contemporary Literature.', 'Noninvasive Prediction of High-Grade Prostate Cancer via Biparametric MRI Radiomics.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging radiomics predicts preoperative axillary lymph node metastasis to support surgical decisions and is associated with tumor microenvironment in invasive breast cancer: A machine learning, multicenter study.', 'Radiomics Models Based on Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Maps for the Prediction of High-Grade Prostate Cancer at Radical Prostatectomy: Comparison With Preoperative Biopsy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'What benefit can be obtained from magnetic resonance imaging diagnosis with artificial intelligence in prostate cancer compared with clinical assessments?', 'The Use of MRI-Derived Radiomic Models in Prostate Cancer Risk Stratification: A Critical Review of Contemporary Literature.', 'Unsupervised Analysis Based on DCE-MRI Radiomics Features Revealed Three Novel Breast Cancer Subtypes with Distinct Clinical Outcomes and Biological Characteristics.', 'Integration between Novel Imaging Technologies and Modern Radiotherapy Techniques: How the Eye Drove the Chisel.', 'Prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer with a multimodal MRI-based radiomics nomogram.']"""

However, after a protracted drug administration, many patients develop a form of androgen insensitivity since R-bicalutamide starts to exhibit some agonistic properties lead by the W741L AR mutation in the ligand-binding pocket even if the mechanism of the antagonist-agonist switch is still not clear. To study the drug-resistant mechanism, we explored the structural effects of the antagonist R-bicalutamide on the homodimer stability considering both the AR wild-type and W741L employing molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The results obtained indicate that the binding of R-bicalutamide in the two AR monomers induces a great instability in the homodimer, which may determine the monomer's dissociation preventing AR migration into the nucleus and avoiding the transcriptional activity. If the W741L mutation occurs, the homodimer tends to have a behaviour close to the agonistic system where the two monomers are tightly bound, which may explain the effect of the W741L in drug insensitivity from a structural point of view.""","""['Francesca Cavaliere', 'Pietro Cozzini']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Interaction mechanism exploration of R-bicalutamide/S-1 with WT/W741L AR using molecular dynamics simulations.', 'The antiandrogen bicalutamide activates the androgen receptor (AR) with a mutation in codon 741 through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MARK) pathway in human prostate cancer PC3 cells.', 'Molecular mechanism of R-bicalutamide switching from androgen receptor antagonist to agonist induced by amino acid mutations using molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculation.', 'Comparison of the effect of the antiandrogen apalutamide (ARN-509) versus bicalutamide on the androgen receptor pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Activity of androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide in prostate cancer cells is independent of NCoR and SMRT corepressors.']"""

Although individual MS components are associated with increased risk of cancer, it is still unclear whether the association between MS and cancer differs from the association between individual MS components and cancer. The aim of this matched case-control study was to estimate the association of 13 types of cancer with (1) MS and (2) the diagnosis of 0, 1 or 2 individual MS components.  Methods:   Cases included 183,248 patients ≥40 years from the SIDIAP database with incident cancer diagnosed between January 2008-December 2017. Each case was matched to four controls by inclusion date, sex and age. Adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between MS and cancer risk, comparing the effect of global MS versus having one or two individual components of MS.  Results:   MS was associated with an increased risk of the following cancers: colorectal (OR: 1.28, 95%CI: 1.23-1.32), liver (OR: 1.93, 95%CI: 1.74-2.14), pancreas (OR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.63-1.98), post-menopausal breast (OR: 1.10, 95%CI: 1.06-1.15), pre-menopausal endometrial (OR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.74-2.65), post-menopausal endometrial (OR: 2.46, 95%CI: 2.20-2.74), bladder (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.34-1.48), kidney (OR: 1.84, 95%CI: 1.69-2.00), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.10-1.38), leukaemia (OR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.31-1.54), lung (OR: 1.11, 95%CI: 1.05-1.16) and thyroid (OR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.50-1.95). Except for prostate, pre-menopause breast cancer and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, MS is associated with a higher risk of cancer than 1 or 2 individual MS components. Estimates were significantly higher in men than in women for colorectal and lung cancer, and in smokers than in non-smokers for lung cancer.

Although urinary miRNAs are promising non-invasive biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa), their clinical application is challenging for technical reasons. We examined the efficacy of urinary hsv2-miR-H9 to hsa-miR-3659 ratio as a non-invasive diagnostic biomarker of PCa.  Materials and methods:   The expression of urinary miRNAs was quantified by real-time PCR in 116 samples from 53 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 63 patients with PCa. The miRNA expression ratio was calculated using an upregulated miRNA (hsv2-miR-H9) as the numerator and a downregulated miRNA (hsa-miR-3659) as the denominator.  Results:   The urinary miR-H9 to miR-3659 ratio was significantly higher in PCa than in BPH controls (p<0.001). The diagnostic accuracy of the urinary miRNA expression ratio was comparable with that of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve comparison, p=0.287). The area under the curve for urinary miRNA expression ratio was 0.862 and that for PSA was 0.642 in the ""PSA gray zone"" (3-10 ng/mL) (ROC curve comparison, p=0.034). The use of the urinary miRNA expression ratio would have prevented 70.6% of unnecessary prostate biopsies; however, 28.6% of PCa cases could be missed in patients within the PSA gray zone.

Results:   In Korean men, prostate cancer was the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2016. Based on newly diagnosed cases, the leading cancer site in the year 2034 is expected to be the lung, and the prostate is expected to be the second most frequently diagnosed cancer among Korean men. Age-standardized incidence rates of the most common cancers in men, except prostate cancer, are expected to decrease until 2034. Lung cancer is projected to remain the most common cause of cancer-related mortality until 2034, and the highest estimated change in cancer deaths is expected to be for prostate cancer.

Cellular thermal shift assay reveals that SU086 binds to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and leads to a decrease in HSP90 levels. Proteomic profiling demonstrates that SU086 binds to and decreases HSP90. Metabolomic profiling reveals that SU086 leads to perturbation of glycolysis.

Because Na+-K+-ATPase is widely involved in various pathological processes, but the action of its α2 subtype (ATP1A2) in PC is unclear, we investigated the role of ATP1A2 in the invasion and migration of PC cells.  Methods:   We measured the expression levels of ATP1A2 in human normal prostate epithelial cell line (RWPE-1) and PC cell lines (PC-3 and DU145) by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of PC-3 and DU145 cells were investigated through clone formation assay, EdU assay, flow cytometry and transwell assay, respectively. The effect of ATP1A2 on a tumor-inhibitory pathway [transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/Smad] was assessed using western blot. In addition, tumor formation was detected using in vivo xenograft model in male BALB/c nude mice.  Results:   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) analysis showed that ATP1A2 expression was reduced in PC patients (P<0.05), and patients with low ATP1A2 expression had a lower survival rate (P<0.05). ATP1A2 levels were significantly reduced in PC-3 and DU145 cells, compared with RWPE-1 cells (P<0.01). We also demonstrated that overexpression of ATP1A2 significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PC-3 and DU145 cells (P<0.01) and promoted apoptosis (P<0.01). However, silencing ATP1A2 had the opposite effect (P<0.01). In addition, overexpression of ATP1A2 significantly inhibited the TGF-β/Smad pathway (P<0.01), whereas silencing ATP1A2 activated the TGF-β/Smad pathway (P<0.01). Meanwhile, the effect of ATP1A2 silencing on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion was reversed by TGF-β/Smad pathway inhibitor (LY364947). Furthermore, ATP1A2 inhibited tumor growth in vivo.

Glycolysis had been validated to promote cancer progression. However, the clinical significance of glycolytic regulators in PCa was not well understood. Here, we discovered that glycolytic regulators were dysregulated in PCa samples using GSE8511, GSE6919, and GEPIA. By detecting the expression of these regulators in PCa samples, we found that SLC2A1, SLC2A3, HK2, PFKFB2, TPI1, PKM2, and LDHA had higher expression in PCa compared with normal tissues. Moreover, both higher expression of TPI1, ALDOA, ENO1, LDHA, and PKM and lower expression of LDHB and HK2 were significantly related to shorter progression-free survival time in PCa. Of note, an 8 gene-based risk score was further constructed and confirmed to have a good performance in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) time in PCa. The signature risk score significantly correlated with NK cell, neutrophil cell, macrophage M2 cell, and myeloid dendritic cell infiltration levels in PCa. After bioinformatics analysis, our data suggested glycolytic regulators participated in the regulation of multiple nonmetabolic biological processes, such as RNA transport, biosynthesis of antibiotics, and cell cycle.

As radiotherapy modulates gene expression and protein phosphorylation dependent on dose and fractionation, we analyzed the long-term effects of irradiation on the post-radiation efficacy of molecular targeted drugs. We irradiated prostate cancer cells either with a single dose (SD) of 10 Gy x-ray or a multifractionated (MF) regimen with 10 fractions of 1 Gy. Whole genome arrays and reverse phase protein microarrays were used to determine gene expression and protein phosphorylation. Additionally, we evaluated radiation-induced pathway activation with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. To measure cell survival and sensitivity to clinically used molecular targeted drugs, we performed colony formation assays. We found increased activation of several pathways regulating important cell functions such as cell migration and cell survival at 24 h after MF irradiation or at 2 months after SD irradiation. Further, cells which survived a SD of 10 Gy showed a long-term upregulation and increased activity of multiple molecular targets including AKT, IGF-1R, VEGFR2, or MET, while HDAC expression was decreased. In line with this, 10 Gy SD cells were more sensitive to target inhibition with Capivasertib or Ipatasertib (AKTi), BMS-754807 (IGF-1Ri), or Foretinib (VEGFR2/METi), but less sensitive to Panobinostat or Vorinostat (HDACi).

In addition, HSP are involved in the regulation of a variety of important signaling pathways and processes as well as many pathological conditions, including cancer. In prostate cancer (PC), HSP60 is associated with poor differentiation and prognostic clinical parameters, such as high Gleason score, initial serum prostate-specific antigen levels, and lower cancer-specific survival. In this study, we investigated the regulation of HSP60 protein in PC.  Materials and methods:   LNCaP or PC3 cells were treated with androgens or transfected with vectors containing microRNA-1 (miR-1), HSP60, HSP60-specific short-hairpin RNA (shHSP60), or a miR-1 inhibitor. The change in HSP60 protein levels was examined using Western blot.  Results:   Treatment of PC cells with androgens did not alter the HSP60 protein levels. Modulation of miR-1 levels in LNCaP cells also did not affect the HSP60 protein. Furthermore, HSP60 levels could not be modified by overexpression or short hairpin RNA.  Conclusion:   It was found that neither physiological factors, such as androgens and the HSP60-specific miR-1, nor overexpression and knockdown systems could influence the HSP60 protein levels.

However, data regarding VAL on 18F-rhPSMA-7.3-ligand PET are currently lacking. This study assesses the prevalence, temporal response to vaccination, and characteristics of VAL. Methods: Two hundred thirty-three consecutive vaccinated and 41 unvaccinated patients with confirmed prostate cancer who underwent 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET/CT were retrospectively analyzed. Size and uptake of the axillary lymph nodes were measured. Ratios of SUVmax of ipsilateral to contralateral axillary lymph node (SUVratio) were determined. The characteristics of SUVratio in respect to the duration of PSMA avidity in the axillary lymph node after COVID-19 vaccination was analyzed. Results: The prevalence of VAL on 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET was 45%. Up to a period of 8 wk after the last COVID-19 vaccination, SUVratio was positive (2.05 ± 0.17). Thereafter, SUVratio dropped significantly (1.35 ± 0.09) and approached the value of unvaccinated group (1.1 ± 0.2). SUVratio of metastatic axillary lymph nodes was very high (>11) and can be easily detected visually or semiquantitatively. In 3 patients, we observed suspected development and consecutively confirmed involving metastasis of axillary lymph node with SUVratio between 4.0 to 6.6. Correlation between SUVratio and lymph node size (r = 0.93, P < 0.0001) and lymph node size and duration after vaccine (r = -0.88, P < 0.0008) was found. Conclusion: Increased uptake of the PSMA ligand 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 by axillary lymph nodes is common after COVID-19 vaccination and can persist for 8 wk.

Patients underwent staging 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT scanning. Preoperatively, a 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligand (99mTc PSMA I&S; 500 MBq) was administered followed by SPECT/CT. A RARP including extended pelvic lymph node dissection was performed, with intraoperative tracing of PSMA-avid tissues using a prototype DROP-IN γ-probe. Resected specimens were also measured ex vivo. Histopathologic concordance with probe findings was evaluated. A radiotracer count of ≥ 1.5 times the background reference (in vivo), and ≥ 10 (absolute count) in the ex vivo setting, was considered positive. Results: Twelve patients were included (median age, 68 y, and prostate-specific antigen, 9.15 ng/mL). Most of the patients harbored ISUP 5 PCa (75%) and had avid lymph nodes on preoperative PSMA PET (64%). The DROP-IN probe aided resection of PSMA-avid (out-of-template) lymph nodes and residual disease at the prostate bed. Eleven metastatic lymph nodes were identified by the probe that were not observed on preoperative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Of the 74 extraprostatic tissue specimens that were resected, 22 (29.7%) contained PCa. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of inpatient use of the γ-probe were 76% (95% CI, 53%-92%), 69% (95% CI, 55%-81%), 50%, and 88%, respectively.

However, the deterioration of CPM performance over time has rarely been studied. This paper proposes a model updating method to solve the calibration drift issue caused by data drift.  Materials and methods:   This paper proposes a novel model updating method based on lifelong machine learning (LML). The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified in four tumor datasets, and a comprehensive comparison with other model updating methods is performed.  Results:   Changes in data distributions cause model performances to drift. The four compared model updating methods have different effects in terms of improving the discrimination and calibration abilities of the tested models. The LML method proposed in this study improves model performance better than or equivalent to the other methods. The proposed method achieved a mean AUC of 0.8249, 0.8780, 0.8261, and 0.8489, a mean AUPRC of 0.7782, 0.9730, 0.4655, and 0.5728, a mean F1 of 0.6866, 0.9552, 0.2985, and 0.3585, and a mean estimated calibration index (ECI) of 0.0320, 0.0338, 0.0101, and 0.0115 using colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer datasets.  Discussion:   The LML framework simultaneously monitors model performance and the distribution of disease risk characteristics, enabling it to effectively address the performance degradation caused by gradual and sudden data drifts and provide reasonable explanations for the causes of performance degradation.

Here, we report the results of a first-in-human phase 1/2 study which assessed the safety, pharmacokinetics, and activity of SHR3680 (a novel AR antagonist) in patients with metastatic CRPC.  Methods:   This phase 1/2 study enrolled patients with progressive metastatic CRPC who had not been previously treated with novel AR-targeted agents. In the phase 1 dose-escalation portion, patients received oral SHR3680 at a starting daily dose of 40 mg, which was subsequently escalated to 80 mg, 160 mg, 240 mg, 360 mg, and 480 mg per day. In phase 2 dose-expansion portion, patients were randomized to receive daily dose of 80 mg, 160 mg, or 240 mg of SHR3680. The primary endpoint in phase 1 was safety and tolerability and in phase 2 was the proportion of patients with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (≥ 50% decrease of PSA level) at week 12.  Results:   A total of 197 eligible patients were enrolled and received SHR3680 treatment, including 18 patients in phase 1 and 179 patients in phase 2.

Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in 116 (58.9%) patients, with the most common one being proteinuria (13.7%). TRAEs of grade ≥ 3 occurred in only 23 (11.7%) patients, and no treatment-related deaths occurred. Antitumor activities were evident at all doses, including PSA response at week 12 in 134 (68.0%; 95% CI, 61.0-74.5) patients, stabilized bone disease at week 12 in 174 (88.3%; 95% CI, 87.2-95.5) patients, and responses in soft tissue lesions in 21 (34.4%, 95% CI, 22.7-47.7) of 61 patients.

However, there is no study reporting the potential role of LMNB1 in a systematic pan-cancer manner.  Methods:   The gene expression level and potential oncogenic roles of LMNB1 in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were analyzed with Tumor Immune Estimation Resource version 2 (TIMER2.0), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis version 2 (GEPIA2), UALCAN and Sangerbox tools. Pathway enrichment analysis was carried out to explore the possible mechanism of LMNB1 on tumorigenesis and tumor progression. The therapeutic effects of LMNB1 knockdown combined with PARP inhibition on human cancers were further investigated in vitro.  Results:   LMNB1 upregulation is generally observed in the tumor tissues of most TCGA cancer types, and is verified in kidney renal clear cell carcinoma using clinical specimens of our institute. High level of LMNB1 expression usually predicts poor overall survival and disease free survival for patients with tumors. Mechanically, LMNB1 level is positively correlated with CD4+ Th2 cell infiltration and DNA homologous recombination repair gene expression. In vitro experiments reveal that targeting LMNB1 has a synergistic effect on prostate cancer with PARP inhibitor treatment.  Conclusions:   LMNB1 is a biomarker of CD4+ Th2 cell infiltration and DNA homologous recombination repair in human cancers.

We have previously developed an automatic 3D prostate segmentation algorithm involving deep learning prediction on radially sampled 2D images followed by 3D reconstruction, trained on a large, clinically diverse dataset with variable image quality. As large clinical datasets are rare, widespread adoption of automatic segmentation could be facilitated with efficient 2D-based approaches and the development of an image quality grading method. The complete training dataset of 6761 2D images, resliced from 206 3D TRUS volumes acquired using end-fire and side-fire acquisition methods, was split to train two separate networks using either end-fire or side-fire images. Split datasets were reduced to 1000, 500, 250, and 100 2D images. For deep learning prediction, modified U-Net and U-Net++ architectures were implemented and compared using an unseen test dataset of 40 3D TRUS volumes. A 3D TRUS image quality grading scale with three factors (acquisition quality, artifact severity, and boundary visibility) was developed to assess the impact on segmentation performance. For the complete training dataset, U-Net and U-Net++ networks demonstrated equivalent performance, but when trained using split end-fire/side-fire datasets, U-Net++ significantly outperformed the U-Net. Compared to the complete training datasets, U-Net++ trained using reduced-size end-fire and side-fire datasets demonstrated equivalent performance down to 500 training images. For this dataset, image quality had no impact on segmentation performance for end-fire images but did have a significant effect for side-fire images, with boundary visibility having the largest impact. Our algorithm provided fast (<1.5 s) and accurate 3D segmentations across clinically diverse images, demonstrating generalizability and efficiency when employed on smaller datasets, supporting the potential for widespread use, even when data is scarce. The development of an image quality grading scale provides a quantitative tool for assessing segmentation performance.""","""['Nathan Orlando', 'Igor Gyacskov', 'Derek J Gillies', 'Fumin Guo', 'Cesare Romagnoli', ""David D'Souza"", 'Derek W Cool', 'Douglas A Hoover', 'Aaron Fenster']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'A deep learning method for real-time intraoperative US image segmentation in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deep Learning for Real-time, Automatic, and Scanner-adapted Prostate (Zone) Segmentation of Transrectal Ultrasound, for Example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Prostate Biopsy.', 'Automatic Segmentation of Multiple Organs on 3D CT Images by Using Deep Learning Approaches.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of AI for Opportunistic Screening of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in CT: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis.', 'Evaluation of an Object Detection Algorithm for Shrapnel and Development of a Triage Tool to Determine Injury Severity.']"""

However, multiparametric ultrasound is more readily available than multiparametric MRI. Data from paired-cohort validation studies and randomised, controlled trials support the use of multiparametric MRI, whereas the evidence for individual ultrasound methods and multiparametric ultrasound is only derived from case series. We aimed to establish the overall agreement between multiparametric ultrasound and multiparametric MRI to diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a prospective, multicentre, paired-cohort, confirmatory study in seven hospitals in the UK. Patients at risk of prostate cancer, aged 18 years or older, with an elevated prostate-specific antigen concentration or abnormal findings on digital rectal examination underwent both multiparametric ultrasound and multiparametric MRI. Multiparametric ultrasound consisted of B-mode, colour Doppler, real-time elastography, and contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Multiparametric MRI included high-resolution T2-weighted images, diffusion-weighted imaging (dedicated high B 1400 s/mm2 or 2000 s/mm2 and apparent diffusion coefficient map), and dynamic contrast-enhanced axial T1-weighted images. Patients with positive findings on multiparametric ultrasound or multiparametric MRI underwent targeted biopsies but were masked to their test results. If both tests yielded positive findings, the order of targeting at biopsy was randomly assigned (1:1) using stratified (according to centre only) block randomisation with randomly varying block sizes. The co-primary endpoints were the proportion of positive lesions on, and agreement between, multiparametric MRI and multiparametric ultrasound in identifying suspicious lesions (Likert score of ≥3), and detection of clinically significant cancer (defined as a Gleason score of ≥4 + 3 in any area or a maximum cancer core length of ≥6 mm of any grade [PROMIS definition 1]) in those patients who underwent a biopsy. Adverse events were defined according to Good Clinical Practice and trial regulatory guidelines. The trial is registered on ISRCTN, 38541912, and ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02712684, with recruitment and follow-up completed.  Findings:   Between March 15, 2016, and Nov 7, 2019, 370 eligible patients were enrolled; 306 patients completed both multiparametric ultrasound and multiparametric MRI and 257 underwent a prostate biopsy. Multiparametric ultrasound was positive in 272 (89% [95% CI 85-92]) of 306 patients and multiparametric MRI was positive in 238 patients (78% [73-82]; difference 11·1% [95% CI 5·1-17·1]). Positive test agreement was 73·2% (95% CI 67·9-78·1; κ=0·06 [95% CI -0·56 to 0·17]). Any cancer was detected in 133 (52% [95% CI 45·5-58]) of 257 patients, with 83 (32% [26-38]) of 257 being clinically significant by PROMIS definition 1. Each test alone would result in multiparametric ultrasound detecting PROMIS definition 1 cancer in 66 (26% [95% CI 21-32]) of 257 patients who had biopsies and multiparametric MRI detecting it in 77 (30% [24-36]; difference -4·3% [95% CI -8·3% to -0·3]). Combining both tests detected 83 (32% [95% CI 27-38]) of 257 clinically significant cancers as per PROMIS definition 1; of these 83 cancers, six (7% [95% CI 3-15]) were detected exclusively with multiparametric ultrasound, and 17 (20% [12-31]) were exclusively detected by multiparametric MRI (agreement 91·1% [95% CI 86·9-94·2]; κ=0·78 [95% CI 0·69-0·86]). No serious adverse events were related to trial activity.  Interpretation:   Multiparametric ultrasound detected 4·3% fewer clinically significant prostate cancers than multiparametric MRI, but it would lead to 11·1% more patients being referred for a biopsy. Multiparametric ultrasound could be an alternative to multiparametric MRI as a first test for patients at risk of prostate cancer, particularly if multiparametric MRI cannot be carried out. Both imaging tests missed clinically significant cancers detected by the other, so the use of both would increase the detection of clinically significant prostate cancers compared with using each test alone.

Patients were recruited from the World Trade Center Health Program. Non-WTC PC samples were frequency matched on age, race/ethnicity and Gleason score. Bisulfite-treated DNA was extracted from tumor tissue blocks and used to assess global DNA methylation with the MethylationEPIC BeadChip. Differential and pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. RNA from the same tumor blocks was used for gene expression analysis to further support DNA methylation findings. Methylation data were generated for 28 samples (13 WTC and 15 non-WTC). Statistically significant differences in methylation were observed for 3,586 genes; on average WTC samples were statistically significantly more hypermethylated (P = 0.04131). Pathway enrichment analysis revealed hypermethylation in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, mitotic spindle, TNFA signaling via NFKB, WNT signaling, and TGF beta signaling pathways in WTC compared to non-WTC samples. The androgen response, G2M and MYC target pathways were hypomethylated. These results correlated well with RNA gene expression. In conclusion, long-term epigenic changes associated with WTC dust exposure were observed in PC tissues. These occurred in genes of critical pathways, likely increasing prostate tumorigenesis potential.

Materials and methodology:   Fifteen patients with locally recurrent prostate cancer after RP and EBRT were salvaged with HDR brachytherapy. Patients had no nodal or distant metastasis evidence on imaging findings, including whole body bone scan, CT scan, and MRI or PSMA PET scan. HDR brachytherapy was applied with 36 Gy in four fractions, in two implantations with 1 week apart.

Results:   Fifteen patients with the mean age of 64 years (ranged 51-79) underwent salvage HDR brachytherapy. The mean baseline level of PSA was calculated 2.26 ng/ml (ranged from 0.21 to 9, SD = 2.33), which has been significantly decreased in all patients. Hence, two of our patients experienced a biochemical failure during the follow-up period. Our results showed that 86.6% (n = 13) of patients had never experienced a significant increment in PSA level after a median follow-up of 48 months (ranging from 12 to 132 months). Besides, salvage HDR brachytherapy did not induce any significant side effects such as acute or late rectal complications, despite causing urinary complication.

Methods:   An integrative radiomics model (IRM) was proposed to predict LNI, confirmed by the histopathologic examination, integrating radiomics features, extracted from prostatic index lesion regions on MRI images, and clinical features via SVM. The study cohort comprised 244 PCa patients with MRI and followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) and ePLND within 6 months between 2010 and 2019. The proposed IRM was trained in training/validation set and evaluated in an internal independent testing set. The model's performance was measured by area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). AUCs were compared via Delong test with 95% confidence interval (CI), and the rest measurements were compared via chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Overall, 17 (10.6%) and 14 (16.7%) patients with LNI were included in training/validation set and testing set, respectively. Shape and first-order radiomics features showed usefulness in building the IRM. The proposed IRM achieved an AUC of 0.915 (95% CI: 0.846-0.984) in the testing set, superior to pre-existing nomograms whose AUCs were from 0.698 to 0.724 (p < 0.05).  Conclusion:   The proposed IRM could be potentially feasible to predict the risk of having LNI for patients with PCa. With the improved predictability, it could be utilized to assess which patients with PCa could safely avoid ePLND, thus reduce the number of unnecessary ePLND.  Key points:   • The combination of MRI-based radiomics features with clinical information improved the prediction of lymph node invasion, compared with the model using only radiomics features or clinical features. • With improved prediction performance on predicting lymph node invasion, the number of extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) could be reduced by the proposed integrative radiomics model (IRM), compared with the existing nomograms.""","""['Haoxin Zheng', 'Qi Miao', 'Yongkai Liu', 'Sohrab Afshari Mirak', 'Melina Hosseiny', 'Fabien Scalzo', 'Steven S Raman', 'Kyunghyun Sung']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['A Novel Nomogram to Identify Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection Among Patients with Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Diagnosed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted and Systematic Biopsies.', 'Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify the Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.', 'Updated nomogram predicting lymph node invasion in patients with prostate cancer undergoing extended pelvic lymph node dissection: the essential importance of percentage of positive cores.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Objective:   To identify clinical, sociodemographic, and structural processes underlying racial disparity in the use of prostate MRI among men with a new diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study used mediation analysis to assess claims in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database for prostate MRI among 39 534 patients with a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015. Statistical analysis was performed from April 1, 2020, to September 1, 2021.  Exposure:   Diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   Claims for prostate MRI within 6 months before or after diagnosis of prostate cancer were assessed. Candidate clinical and sociodemographic meditators were identified based on their association with both race and prostate MRI, including the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE), as specified to measure racialized residential segregation. Mediation analysis was performed using nonlinear multiple additive regression trees models to estimate the direct and indirect effects of mediators.  Results:   A total of 39 534 eligible male patients (3979 Black patients [10.1%] and 32 585 White patients [82.4%]; mean [SD] age, 72.8 [5.3] years) were identified. Black patients with prostate cancer were less likely than White patients to receive a prostate MRI (6.3% vs 9.9%; unadjusted odds ratio, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.54-0.70). Approximately 24% (95% CI, 14%-32%) of the racial disparity in prostate MRI use between Black and White patients was attributable to geographic differences (SEER registry), 19% (95% CI, 11%-28%) was attributable to neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (residence in a high-poverty area), 19% (95% CI, 10%-29%) was attributable to racialized residential segregation (ICE quintile), and 11% (95% CI, 7%-16%) was attributable to a marker of individual-level socioeconomic status (dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid). Clinical and pathologic factors were not significant mediators. In this model, the identified mediators accounted for 81% (95% CI, 64%-98%) of the observed racial disparity in prostate MRI use between Black and White patients.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this this population-based cohort study of US adults, mediation analysis revealed that sociodemographic factors and manifestations of structural racism, including poverty and residential segregation, explained most of the racial disparity in the use of prostate MRI among older Black and White men with prostate cancer.

Cancer mortality across persistent poverty, rurality, and race is understudied.  Methods:   We gathered data on race and cancer deaths (all sites, lung and bronchus, colorectal, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, oropharyngeal, breast and cervical [females], and prostate [males]) from the National Death Index (1990-1992; 2014-2018). We linked these data to county characteristics: 1) persistent poverty or not; and 2) rural or urban. We calculated absolute (range difference [RD]) and relative (range ratio [RR]) disparities for each cancer mortality outcome across persistent poverty, rurality, race, and time.  Results:   The 1990-1992 RD for all sites combined indicated persistent poverty counties had 12.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.37 to 14.09) excess deaths per 100 000 people per year compared with nonpersistent poverty counties; the 2014-2018 RD was 10.99 (95% CI = 10.22 to 11.77). Similarly, the 1990-1992 RR for all sites indicated mortality rates in persistent poverty counties were 1.06 (95% CI = 1.05 to 1.07) times as high as nonpersistent poverty counties; the 2014-2018 RR was 1.07 (95% CI = 1.07 to 1.08). Between 1990-1992 and 2014-2018, absolute and relative disparities by persistent poverty widened for colorectal and breast cancers; however, for remaining outcomes, trends in disparities were stable or mixed. The highest mortality rates were observed among African American or Black residents of rural, persistent poverty counties for all sites, colorectal, oropharyngeal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancers.  Conclusions:   Mortality disparities by persistent poverty endured over time for most cancer outcomes, particularly for racial minorities in rural, persistent poverty counties.

Patients and methods:   We undertook a retrospective study, in a single centre in the United Kingdom, reviewing outcomes for 19 patients (20 hips) treated with a cage reconstruction for metastatic disease of their acetabulum over 6 years. Inclusion criteria were those with an impending fracture of the acetabulum, metastatic dissociation, fracture of the acetabulum and or femur and those whose life expectancy was considered by the oncology team to be >6 months.  Results:   In all patients the Restoration GAP II acetabular cage (Stryker, Howmedica Osteonics Corp, NJ, USA) was used in conjunction with a cemented acetabular cup and cemented femoral stem. The mean age at the time of surgery was 68 (44-87) years with breast cancer being the most common primary malignancy (31%) followed by prostate cancer (26%).Radiological survivorship estimates were 94.1% (95% CI, 99.2-65.0) at 12 and 24 months, 70.6% (95% CI, 93.6-16.0) at 36 months and 35.3% (95% CI, 78.2-1.2) at 48 months. There were 3 radiological failures of the implant due to disease progression. Complications occurred in 3 patients with 2 developing deep infection which was treated with suppressive antibiotic therapy following aspiration of the hip. 1 patient suffered a hip dislocation following trauma which was successfully reduced closed and no further intervention was required.

Samples from ambulatory patients being treated for recurrent or castration-resistant prostate cancers were included in the study. The lipid-rich nature was studied with lipophilic stains and lipid panel analysis, while surface membrane was assessed with specific staining and antibody detection. We identified a new entity, lipid droplet-like objects or circulating fatty objects (CFOs), visible in the blood samples of many cancer patients, with the potential of causing embolism. CFOs were defined as lipid-rich objects with a membrane, capable of gaining in volume through interaction with peripheral blood mononuclear cells in ex vivo culture. Blood samples from pancreatic cancer patients were found to have the highest CFO incidence and largest CFO numbers. Most noticeably, CFOs from many pancreatic cancer samples presented as large clusters entangled in insoluble fiber networks, suggestive of intravascular clotting.

We aimed to determine the association between incident cancer and the following risk of GBS development.  Methods:   We conducted a nationwide population-based case-control study of all patients with first-time hospital-diagnosed GBS in Denmark between 1987 and 2016 and 10 age-, sex-, and index date-matched population controls per case. We identified incident cancer diagnoses between 6 months before and 2 months after the GBS index date. We used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios (ORs) as a measure of relative risk and performed stratified analyses to assess the impact of cancer on GBS risk in strata of calendar periods, sex, and age. In sensitivity analyses, to assess any potential risk of survival bias induced by including cancer diagnoses potentially made after GBS diagnosis, we examined incident cancers in both a broader exposure window (1 year before to 3 months after GBS index date) and a narrower window (6 months to 1 month before the GBS index date).  Results:   Of the 2,414 patients with GBS and 23,909 controls included, 49 cases (2.0%) and 138 controls (0.6%) had a recent cancer diagnosis, yielding a matched OR of 3.6 (95% CI 2.6-5.1) for GBS associated with cancer. Stratification by calendar time, sex, and age showed robust results for the association between cancer and GBS, with no major variations. Broadening and narrowing the exposure window produced slightly weakened associations of OR of 2.4 (95% CI 1.8-3.3) and 2.5 (95% CI 1.5-4.1), respectively. The GBS ORs were highest for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue (OR 7.2, 95% CI 2.9-18.0), respiratory tract (OR 5.6, 95% CI 2.7-11.9), prostate and other male genital organ (OR 5.0, 95% CI 2.1-11.6), and breast (OR 5.0, 95% CI 1.7-14.5) cancer.  Discussion:   In this large nationwide epidemiologic study, incident cancer was associated with a markedly increased risk of subsequent GBS development.

Currently, there is still a lack of effective strategies for improving tumor immunogenicity.  Methods:   The antitumor effect of ultrasound-stimulated nanobubbles (USNBs) alone and in combination with an anti-PD1 antibody was evaluated in RM1 (prostate cancer), MC38 (colon cancer) and B16 (melanoma) xenograft mouse models. The phenotypes of antigen-presenting cells and CD8+ T cells were evaluated by flow cytometry. Damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release, antigen release and tumor cell necrosis were assessed via western blot, flow cytometry, transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscopy.  Results:   USNB promoted the infiltration and antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells. The combination of USNB and anti-PD1 blockade improved systemic antitumor immunity and resulted in an abscopal effect and long-term immune memory protection after complete tumor remission. Mechanistically, tumor-targeting USNB induced tumor cell necrosis through an ultrasound-mediated cavitation effect, which significantly increased DAMP release and tumor antigen presentation, consequently sensitizing tumors to ICB treatment.

The median [IQR] time from focal IRE to sRARP was 42 (21-57) months. There were no rectal, bladder or ureteric injuries. The T-stage was pT2 in 9 (60%) patients and pT3a in 6 (40%) patients. Only one (7%) patient had a positive surgical margin. At a median [IQR] follow up of 22 (16-32) months no patient had a biochemical recurrence (PSA > 0.2). All 15 patients were continent (pad-free) by 6 months and 9 (60%) patients had erections sufficient for intercourse with or without PDE5 inhibitors. No predisposing factors were identified for predicting erectile dysfunction after sRARP.  Conclusions:   In patients with recurrent or residual significant PCa after focal IRE ablation it is feasible to obtain good functional and oncological outcomes with sRARP. Our results demonstrate that good outcomes can be achieved with sRARP, when respecting close monitoring post-IRE, good patient selection and surgical experience. The limitations of this study are that it is a small series, with short follow up and a lack of standardised quality of life instruments.""","""['Alexandar Blazevski', 'William Gondoputro', 'Matthijs J Scheltema', 'Amer Amin', 'Bart Geboers', 'Daniela Barreto', 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Ron Shnier', 'Warick Delprado', 'Shikha Agrawal', 'James E Thompson', 'Phillip D Stricker']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Techniques and Outcomes of Salvage Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (sRARP).', 'Peri-operative, functional and early oncologic outcomes of salvage robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy after high-intensity focused ultrasound partial ablation.', 'Outcomes of salvage radical prostatectomy after initial irreversible electroporation treatment for recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Salvage Local Treatments After Focal Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Irreversible electroporation (IRE): a narrative review of the development of IRE from the laboratory to a prostate cancer treatment.', 'Guidelines of guidelines: focal therapy for prostate cancer, is it time for consensus?', 'Complications Risk Assessment and Imaging Findings of Thermal Ablation Treatment in Liver Cancers: What the Radiologist Should Expect.']"""

ExoCe6+R848 was constructed by simple co-incubation of Ce6 and R848 with HEK 293T cell-derived exosomes. The properties of exosomes were not affected after loading Ce6 and R848, and the exosomes were accumulated in the tumor site after intratumoral injection. In vitro and in vivo assays showed that ultrasonic irradiation enhanced R848-mediated DCs maturation when ExoCe6+R848 was engulfed by DCs, as demonstrated by the upregulated expression of CD80 and CD86. Furthermore, these engineered exosomes together with ultrasound irradiation could synergistically reprogram macrophages from an immunosuppressive M2-like phenotype to an anti-tumor M1-like phenotype, further activating effector T cells and reverting the immunosuppressive microenvironment. The exosome delivery strategy not only supplies a paradigm for overcoming side effects of systemic delivery of Ce6 and R848, but also offers an effective combination regimen of cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Dingyi Wang', 'Zhuo Wan', 'Qian Yang', 'Jianmei Chen', 'Yunnan Liu', 'Fan Lu', 'Jie Tang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Drug Deliv""","""['Exosome-mediated delivery of transforming growth factor-β receptor 1 kinase inhibitors and toll-like receptor 7/8 agonists for combination therapy of tumors.', 'Exosome-based photoacoustic imaging guided photodynamic and immunotherapy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 'Macrophages mediated delivery of chlorin e6 and treatment of lung cancer by photodynamic reprogramming.', 'Exosomes: Powerful weapon for cancer nano-immunoengineering.', 'Exosomes Derived from Immune Cells: The New Role of Tumor Immune Microenvironment and Tumor Therapy.', 'Recent Progress in Extracellular Vesicle-Based Carriers for Targeted Drug Delivery in Cancer Therapy.', 'Hypoxia-elicited Exosomes Promote the Chemoresistance of Pancreatic Cancer Cells by Transferring LncROR via Hippo Signaling.', 'Engineered exosomes from different sources for cancer-targeted therapy.', 'Exosomes as smart drug delivery vehicles for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Exosomes and cancer immunotherapy: A review of recent cancer research.']"""

The treatment of the prostate itself in mPCa represents a new paradigm in the so-called oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPCa), which is considered to be a kind of intermediate stage between localized disease and extensive metastatic disease. Thanks to new dia-gnostic methods, OMPCa is an increasingly frequently dia-gnosed stage of mPCa. In addition to improving local control of the disease, aggressive local therapy could lower the need for ADT, or improve survival. Radiotherapy has already demonstrated the oncological benefit of OMPCa in a randomized study and is now part of the guidelines for the treatment of low volume de novo mPCa. Cytoreductive prostatectomy (CP) is still awaiting the results of randomized trials; however, retrospective data already exist to support this treatment modality. Several population-based studies have been published that have demonstrated the benefit of CP. Minor retrospective works have demonstrated the safety of CP in clinical practice. Several prospective randomized trials investigating this treatment modality are currently underway. However, the whole concept of CP in OMPCa is still shrouded in many unresolved issues such as the definition of a suitable patient and the role of another form of local therapy targeted to metastases.

However, developing a urinary exosomal miRNA detection method with high accuracy is challenging because of the low abundance and high sequence homology of miRNAs. Herein, we present a quantitative and label-free miRNA sensing platform using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) based on three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical plasmonic nano-architecture to detect urinary exosomal miRNAs. This hierarchical nanostructure is constructed by self-assembly between target-complementary DNA probes-conjugated gold nanoparticles and head-flocked gold nanopillars in the presence of the target miRNAs, creating numerous 3D plasmonic hot-spots inducing exceedingly high amplification of SERS signals. This 3D SERS biosensor achieved ∼10 aM detection limits for the target miRNAs (miR-10a and miR-21), which is over 1000-fold more sensitive than previously reported miRNA sensors without the requirement of any labelling or pre-treatment steps. Finally, the clinical validation using urinary samples revealed that our 3D SERS sensor discriminates PC patients from healthy control with high diagnostic accuracy (0.93) based on the differential expression level of urinary exosomal miRNAs. These outputs demonstrate that our SERS sensor based on 3D hierarchical nano-architecture can offer facile, accurate and rapid methods to measure miRNA expression and is helpful for the diagnosis of various diseases.""","""['Woo Hyun Kim', 'Jong Uk Lee', 'Myeong Jin Jeon', 'Kyong Hwa Park', 'Sang Jun Sim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Quantitative and Specific Detection of Exosomal miRNAs for Accurate Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Using a Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Sensor Based on Plasmonic Head-Flocked Gold Nanopillars.', 'A label-free, ultra-highly sensitive and multiplexed SERS nanoplasmonic biosensor for miRNA detection using a head-flocked gold nanopillar.', 'Quantitative detection of exosomal microRNA extracted from human blood based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering.', 'Current strategies of plasmonic nanoparticles assisted surface-enhanced Raman scattering toward biosensor studies.', 'Development and Application of Aptamer-Based Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Sensors in Quantitative Analysis and Biotherapy.', 'miRNAs as Predictors of Barrier Integrity.', 'Nucleic Acid Probes in Bio-Imaging and Diagnostics: Recent Advances in ODN-Based Fluorescent and Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Nanoparticle and Nanostructured Systems.', 'Electrochemical aptasensor based on the engineered core-shell MOF nanostructures for the detection of tumor antigens.', 'Exosomes: A potential tool for immunotherapy of ovarian cancer.', 'Gold Nanoparticles as a Biosensor for Cancer Biomarker Determination.']"""

Methods:   Patients diagnosed with PCa, without lymph node or distant metastasis, who received RP in West China Hospital between January 2009 and April 2019, were enrolled in this study. We performed survival, multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, and subgroup analyses.  Results:   A total of 262 patients were enrolled, including 107 patients who received castration alone and 155 patients who received CAB. The survival analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the two groups (hazard ratios [HR] = 1.07, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI] = 0.60-1.90, P = 0.8195). Moreover, the multivariable Cox model provided similarly negative results before and after adjustment for potential covariant. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the clinical recurrence between the two groups in both non-adjusted and adjusted models. Furthermore, our subgroup analysis showed that CAB achieved better biochemical recurrence (BCR) outcomes than medical castration alone as adjuvant ADT for locally advanced PCa (P for interaction = 0.0247, HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.14-1.00, P = 0.0497).

Despite its global good prognosis, cases can vary from indolent to lethal metastatic and scientific efforts are aimed to discern those with worse outcomes. Current prognostic markers, as Gleason score, fall short when it comes to distinguishing these cases. Identification of new early biomarkers to enable a better PCa distinction and classification remains a challenge. In order to identify new genes implicated in PCa progression we conducted several differential gene expression analyses over paired samples comparing primary PCa tissue against healthy prostatic tissue of PCa patients. The results obtained show that this approach is a serious alternative to overcome patient heterogeneity. We were able to identify 250 genes whose expression varies along with tissue differentiation-healthy to tumor tissue, 161 of these genes are described here for the first time to be related to PCa. The further manual curation of these genes allowed to annotate 39 genes with antitumoral activity, 22 of them described for the first time to be related to PCa proliferation and metastasis. These findings could be replicated in different cohorts for most genes. Results obtained considering paired differential expression, functional annotation and replication results point to: CGREF1, UNC5A, C16orf74, LGR6, IGSF1, QPRT and CA14 as possible new early markers in PCa.

Zambia Central Statistics Office (CSO) demographic data were used to determine catchment area denominator used to calculate prevalence and incidence rates of cancers. Age-adjusted rates and case fatality rates were estimated using standard methods. We used a Poisson Approximation for calculating 95% confidence intervals (CI).  Results:   The seven most cancer prevalent districts in Zambia were Luangwa, Kabwe, Lusaka, Monze, Mongu, Katete and Chipata. Cervical cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and Kaposi's sarcoma were the four most prevalent cancers as well as major causes of cancer related deaths in Zambia. Age adjusted rates and 95% CI for these cancers were: cervix uteri (186.3; CI = 181.77 - 190.83), prostate (60.03; CI = 57.03 - 63.03), breast (38.08; CI = 36.0 - 40.16) and Kaposi's sarcoma (26.18; CI = 25.14 - 27.22).

Previous studies have shown cancer incidence rates vary by ethnic group in England. Since their publication, the completeness of ethnicity recording in cancer data has improved, and relevant inequalities (e.g. risk factor prevalence and healthcare access) may have changed.  Methods:   Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated for Asian, Black, Mixed/Multiple and White ethnic groups in England in 2013-2017, using almost 3 million diagnoses across 31 cancer sites. Rate ratios were calculated with the White ethnic group as reference. Sensitivity analyses used imputed ethnicity for cases with missing data and perturbed population estimates.  Results:   Incidence rates for most cancer sites and ethnic group and sex combinations were lower in non-White minority ethnic groups compared with the corresponding White group, with particularly low rate ratios (below 0.5) for melanoma skin cancer and some smoking-related cancers (lung, bladder and oesophageal cancers). Exceptions included prostate cancer (2.1 times higher in males of Black ethnicity), myeloma (2.7-3.0 times higher in people of Black ethnicity), several gastrointestinal cancers (1.1-1.9 times higher in people of Black ethnicity, 1.4-2.2 times higher in people of Asian ethnicity), Hodgkin lymphoma (1.1 times higher in males of Asian ethnicity, 1.3 times higher in males of Black ethnicity) and thyroid cancers (1.4 times higher in people of Asian ethnicity, 1.2 times higher in people of Black ethnicity). Sensitivity analyses did not materially alter these results (rate ratios changed by a maximum of 12 percentage points, the direction and significance of results were unchanged in all but two cancer site/sex/ethnic group combinations).  Conclusions:   People of non-White minority ethnicity in England generally have lower cancer risk than the White population, though there are a number of notable exceptions. These results should galvanise efforts to better understand the reasons for this variation, and the possible impact on cancer services, patient experiences and outcomes.""","""['Christine Delon', 'Katrina F Brown', 'Nick W S Payne', 'Yannis Kotrotsios', 'Sally Vernon', 'Jon Shelton']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Incidence of gastrointestinal cancers by ethnic group in England, 2001-2007.', 'Ethnic inequalities in the incidence of diagnosis of severe mental illness in England: a systematic review and new meta-analyses for non-affective and affective psychoses.', 'Ethnic differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, and death in 17 million adults in England: an observational cohort study using the OpenSAFELY platform.', 'Variation in Breast Cancer Subtype Incidence and Distribution by Race/Ethnicity in the United States From 2010 to 2015.', 'Ethnic Inequalities in Healthcare Use and Care Quality among People with Multiple Long-Term Health Conditions Living in the United Kingdom: A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis.', 'Experiences of using a supported digital intervention for cancer survivors in primary care: a qualitative process evaluation.', 'The Influence of Ethnicity on Survival from Malignant Primary Brain Tumours in England: A Population-Based Cohort Study.', ""Risk Stratified Follow-Up for Endometrial Cancer: The Clinicians' Perspective."", 'Dépistage du cancer de la prostate chez les hommes noirs au Canada : Argument en faveur des soins stratifiés en fonction du risque.', 'Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

In this study, we observed that several OTU members displayed genomic amplification in PCa, among which ovarian tumor deubiquitinase 6A (OTUD6A) amplified in the top around 15-20%. Further clinical investigation showed that the OTUD6A protein was highly expressed in prostate tumors, and increased OTUD6A expression correlated with a higher biochemical recurrence risk after prostatectomy. Biologically, wild-type but not a catalytically inactive mutant form of OTUD6A was required for PCa cell progression. In vivo experiments demonstrated that OTUD6A oligonucleotides markedly suppressed prostate tumorigenesis in PtenPC-/- mice and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Mechanistically, the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit Brg1 and the nuclear receptor AR (androgen receptor) were identified as essential substrates for OTUD6A in PCa cells by a mass spectrometry (MS) screening approach. Furthermore, OTUD6A stabilized these two proteins by erasing the K27-linked polyubiquitination of Brg1 and K11-linked polyubiquitination of AR. OTUD6A amplification exhibited strong mutual exclusivity with mutations in the tumor suppressors FBXW7 and SPOP.

This study is the first population-based study to estimate the net survival (NS) of adult cancer patients in Reunion Island, a French overseas department with distinctive epidemiological, cultural, and sociodemographic characteristics.  Methods:   All adult incident cases (n=23,055) of invasive solid tumors diagnosed between 1998 and 2014 and registered in the Reunion Island Cancer Registry were included in the study. The Pohar-Perme estimator was used to estimate 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year NS.  Results:   5-year NS ranged from 7% (liver in women) to 97% (thyroid cancer in women) for cancers diagnosed between 2006 and 2014. For the most common cancers, the age-standardized 5-year NS of women was 81% for breast cancer, 58% for colorectal cancer and 62% for cervical cancer. For men, the age-standardized 5-year NS was 85% for prostate cancer, 12% for lung cancer, and 52% for colorectal cancer. Age-standardized 5-year NS increased slightly with the period of diagnosis (from 1998-2005 to 2006-2014) for prostate, breast, head and neck, lung, colorectal (women), and stomach (men) cancers, remained stable for colorectal (men) cancer, and decreased slightly for cervical and stomach (women) cancers.  Discussion:   Overall, NS was lower in Reunion Island than in mainland France. While the epidemiological, cultural, and sociodemographic characteristics of the Reunionese population likely explain some of the observed differences compared to mainland France, site-specific studies are needed to explore the different determinants of survival in Reunion Island.""","""['Sophie Devos', 'Mohamed Khettab', 'Emmanuel Chirpaz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bull Cancer""","""['Survival and epidemiological characteristics of women with lung cancer in Reunion.', 'Incidence and survival of childhood cancer in the French islands of Reunion and Mayotte (2005-2011).', 'Cancer net survival on registry data: use of the new unbiased Pohar-Perme estimator and magnitude of the bias with the classical methods.', 'Health, illness and cancer in Reunion Island: Health services in a diverse but aging French territory.', 'Oncogenetics in the French overseas departments and regions: Situation in Reunion Island.']"""

Described as a ""hidden population,"" the principal research challenge has been to develop effective methods to identify and recruit such cancer patients into cancer studies. Online recruitment strategies, as well as targeted clinic recruitment using patient-entered sexual orientation and gender identity data from electronic medical records have potential to transform recruitment, but studies testing the effects of how to recruit using these have not been published.  Methods:   In 2019, we conducted a naturalistic, three-arm, stratified prospective study to compare three recruitment strategies: (a) clinic based recruitment of prostate cancer patients from gay health and urology clinics; (b) directly from the gay community; and (c) online recruitment (through cancer support, sex/dating, and social sites). For each strategy, we estimated time, workload, and direct costs involved. To study how recruitment strategy may affect sampling, we tested for retention rates, demographic and outcome differences across sites. Using these methods, we successfully recruited 401 gay and bisexual prostate cancer patients into a randomized, controlled, 24-month trial testing an online sexual and urinary rehabilitation curriculum tailored for this population.  Results:   There were seven key results. First, it is possible to recruit substantial numbers of sexual minority men into prostate cancer studies provided online recruitment methods are used. Second, we observed big differences in dropout during study onboarding by recruitment source. Third, within online recruitment, the online sex/dating application (app) was the most successful and efficient, followed by the cancer support site, and then the social networking site. Fourth, while clinics were the cheapest source of recruitment, they were time intensive and low in yield. Fifth, the cancer support site and sex/dating app recruits differed by several characteristics, with the former being more rehabilitation-focused while the latter were younger and more sexually active. Sixth, we found almost no differences in outcomes across the three online recruitment sites. Seventh, because retention in online studies has been a concern, we confirm very low attrition at 3- and 6 months into the trial.  Conclusion:   For sexual minority cancer research, more research on how to use sexual orientation and gender identity electronic medical record data for clinic-based recruitment is needed. For other small or hard-to-reach populations, researchers should compare and publish online versus offline recruitment strategies.""","""['B R Simon Rosser', 'Morgan Wright', 'Chris J Hoefer', 'Elizabeth J Polter', 'Nidhi Kohli', 'Christopher W Wheldon', 'Ryan Haggart', 'Kristine Mc Talley', 'Darryl Mitteldorf', 'Gunna Kilian', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Michael W Ross', 'William West']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Trials""","""['Reaching Adolescent Gay, Bisexual, and Queer Men Online: Development and Refinement of a National Recruitment Strategy.', 'Online Versus Telephone Methods to Recruit and Interview Older Gay and Bisexual Men Treated for Prostate Cancer: Findings from the Restore Study.', 'Recruiting Hard-to-Reach Populations for Survey Research: Using Facebook and Instagram Advertisements and In-Person Intercept in LGBT Bars and Nightclubs to Recruit LGBT Young Adults.', 'Sex After Prostate Cancer in Gay and Bisexual Men: A Review of the Literature.', 'Online interventions to address HIV and other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections among young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men: a systematic review.', 'Sexual health and treatment-related sexual dysfunction in sexual and gender minorities with prostate cancer.', 'Discrimination of Sexual and Gender Minority Patients in Prostate Cancer Treatment: Results from the Restore-1 Study.', 'The Effects of Prostate Cancer Treatment on Role-In-Sex in Gay and Bisexual Men: Mixed Methods Results from the Restore-1 and Restore-2 Studies.']"""

Few interventions have focused on protecting specifically men. Emerging evidence may implicate testosterone. Neurokinin 3 receptor (NK3R) antagonists, an existing class of drugs being considered as treatments for reproductive conditions in women, affect testosterone; this study addresses genetic validation of their use to prevent IHD in men.  Methods:   A one-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study using the UK Biobank cohort study, based on independent (r2 < 0.005) genetic variants predicting testosterone in men (n = 157738) at genome wide significance in the target gene for NK3R antagonists (TACR3), was used to assess associations with IHD (cases=15056, non-cases=151964) and positive control outcomes (relative age voice broke, children fathered, hypertension) in men and a negative control outcome (IHD) in women using summary statistics. A two-sample MR study using the PRACTICAL consortium was used for the positive control outcome of prostate cancer.  Findings:   Two relevant TACR3 genetic variants (rs116646027 and rs1351623) were identified in men. Genetically mimicked NK3R antagonists were inversely associated with IHD (odds ratio 0.54 per standard deviation lower testosterone, 95% confidence interval 0.31, 0.94) and with control outcomes (older relative age voice broke, fewer children and lower risk of hypertension and prostate cancer) as expected in men and in women (unrelated to IHD).  Interpretation:   Genetic validation of a role of NK3R antagonists in IHD suggests their consideration as a new means of preventing IHD in men.

An ecological study based on the cancer mortality data collected from 5,565 Brazilian cities during 2010-2018 using a difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, was applied to examine PM2.5-cancer mortality associations. Globally gridded annual average surface PM2.5 concentration was extracted and linked with the residential municipality of participants in this study. Sex, age stratified and exposure-response estimations were also conducted. Totalling 1,768,668 adult cancer deaths records of about 208 million population living across 5,565 municipalities were included in this study. The average PM2.5 concentration was 7.63 μg/m3 (standard deviation 3.32) with range from 2.95 μg/m3 to 28.5 μg/m3. With each 10 μg/m3 increase in three-year-average (current year and previous two years) concentrations of PM2.5, the relative risks (RR) of cancer mortality were 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-1.20) for all-site cancers. The PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with several cancer-specific mortalities including oral, nasopharynx, oesophagus, and stomach, colon rectum, liver, gallbladder, larynx, lung, bone, skin, female breast, cervix, prostate, brain and leukaemia. No safe level of PM2.5 exposure was observed in the exposure-response curve for all types of cancer. In conclusion, with nationwide cancer death records in Brazil, we found that long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 increased risks of mortality for many cancer types.

To test the hypothesis, we studied associations across 25(OH)D, PCA and death in 2578 middle-aged men belonging to the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study. The men were free of cancer at baseline, and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 23.3 (9.1) years. During this period, 296 men had a PCA diagnosis, and 1448 men died without the PCA diagnosis.

A competing risk analysis showed that belonging to the highest 25(OH)D tertile increased the risk of PCA incidence and improved survival with the respective hazard ratios (HR) of 1.35 (95% CI = 1.07-1.70) and 0.79 (95% CI = 0.71-0.89). Adjusting for 10 covariates together with 25(OH)D did not significantly change the results, but the respective adjusted HRs for PCA and death were 1.20 and 0.87.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of two separate cohorts of men with prostate cancer: (1) a multicenter cohort of 17,256 men who underwent germline testing in a CLIA-certified laboratory and (2) a single-center cohort of all men eligible for germline testing between 2018 and 2020. The proportions of P/LP alterations and variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were computed. Fisher's exact test was used to compare germline alteration rates for significance. A multivariate logistic regression was performed adjusting for demographic and clinical factors to examine factors associated with germline testing.  Results:   In the multicenter cohort, the rate of P/LP germline alterations among self-reported Hispanic men was 7.1%, which was lower than self-reported NHW men (9.7% vs. 7.1%, p = 0.058), but was not statistically significant. The VUS rate was significantly higher among the Hispanic cohort (21.5% vs. 16.6%, p = 0.005). In the single-center cohort, 136 Hispanic patients were eligible for testing of which 34 underwent germline testing (26.1%, N = 34/136). Of all prostate cancer patients in the single-center cohort undergoing germline testing (n = 173), the rate of P/LP alterations in Hispanic patients was not significantly different compared to NHW patients (14.7% vs. 12.2%, p = 0.77). The rate of VUS in Hispanic patients was significantly higher than that of NHW patients (20.6% vs. 7.2%, p = 0.047).  Conclusion:   The P/LP germline alteration rate in our cohorts was similar between Hispanic and NHW men.

We have previously shown that overexpression of miR-32 in the prostate of transgenic mice potentiates proliferation in prostate epithelium. Here, we set out to determine whether increased expression of miR-32 influences growth or phenotype in prostate adenocarcinoma in vivo. We studied transgenic mice expressing MYC oncogene (hiMYC mice) to induce tumorigenesis in the mouse prostate and discovered that transgenic overexpression of miR-32 resulted in increased tumor burden as well as a more aggressive tumor phenotype in this model. Elevated expression of miR-32 increased proliferation as assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry, increased nuclear density, and higher mitotic index in the tumors. By gene expression analysis of the tumorous prostate tissue, we confirmed earlier findings that miR-32 expression regulates prostate secretome by modulating expression levels of several PC-related target genes such as Spink1, Spink5, and Msmb. Further, we identified Pdk4 as a tumor-associated miR-32 target in the mouse prostate. Expression analysis of PDK4 in human PC reveals an inverse correlation with miR-32 expression and Gleason score, a decrease in castration-resistant and metastatic tumors compared to untreated primary PC, and an association of low PDK4 expression with a shorter recurrence-free survival of patients. Although decreased PDK4 expression induces the higher metabolic activity of PC cells, induced expression of PDK4 reduces both mitotic respiration and glycolysis rates as well as inhibits cell growth.

Here, we showed that downregulation of METTL3 in prostate cancer TAMs modulated macrophages toward an M2-like phenotype and that this modulation was mediated by activation of STAT6. In addition, our data demonstrated that prostate cancer cell-derived small lipid molecule lipoxin A4 (LXA4) activated STAT6 by inhibiting METTL3. Treatment with PBP10 (an inhibitor of the LXA4 receptor) abolished the inhibition of METTL3 by LXA4 and consequently reduced the tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells. Altogether, this work demonstrated that prostate cancer cells facilitate polarization of M2 like macrophages by releasing LXA4 via inhibiting METTL3.

However, hypoxia, often seen in PCa tumors, leads to radiation-resistance. This work investigates the effect of a novel oxygen-generating polymer-lipid manganese dioxide nanoparticle (PLMDs) on improving RT outcomes in CRPC xenograft models by modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) both before and after RT.  Materials and methods:   Human PC3 and DU145 PCa cells were used to investigate clonogenic inhibition and DNA repair pathways in vitro. Tumor hypoxia and post-RT angiogenesis were evaluated in a PC3-bearing SCID mouse model. PC3 and DU145 xenografts were used to study the efficacy of PLMD in combination with single or fractionated RT.  Results:   PLMD plus RT significantly inhibited clonogenic potential, increased DNA double-strand breaks, and reduced DNA damage repair in hypoxic PC3 and DU145 cells as compared to RT alone. PLMD significantly reduced hypoxia-positive areas, hypoxia induced factor 1α (HIF-1α) expression, and protein carbonyl levels (a measure of oxidative stress). Application of PLMD with RT decreased RT-induced angiogenic biomarkers by up to 3-fold. Treatment of the human CRPC xenografts with PLMD plus RT (single or fractionated doses) significantly prolonged median survival of the host compared to RT alone resulting in up to a 40% curative rate.  Conclusion:   PLMD treatment modulated TME and sensitized hypoxic human CRPC cells to RT thus enhancing the efficacy of RT.

The proportions of patients who went through the CPP within the recommended time frames were highest among colon (84%) and breast (76%) cancer patients who underwent surgery and lung cancer patients who started systemic anticancer treatment (76%), and lowest for prostate cancer patients who underwent surgery (43%). The time from treatment decision to start of treatment was the main source of delay for all cancers. Travelling outside the resident health trust prolonged waiting time and was associated with a reduced odds of receiving surgery and radiotherapy for lung and rectal cancer patients, respectively.  Conclusions:   Achievement of national recommendations of the CCP times differed by cancer type and treatment. Identified bottlenecks in the pathway should be targeted to decrease waiting times. Further, CPP guidelines should be re-examined to determine their ongoing relevance.""","""['Yngvar Nilssen', 'Odd Terje Brustugun', 'Morten Tandberg Eriksen', 'Marianne G Guren', 'Erik Skaaheim Haug', 'Bjørn Naume', 'Ellen Schlichting', 'Bjørn Møller']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Patient and tumour characteristics associated with inclusion in Cancer patient pathways in Norway in 2015-2016.', 'Decreasing waiting time for treatment before and during implementation of cancer patient pathways in Norway.', 'Factors associated with emergency-onset diagnosis, time to treatment and type of treatment in colorectal cancer patients in Norway.', 'Interventions to reduce waiting times for elective procedures.', 'Does prolonging the time to prostate cancer surgery impact long-term cancer control: a systematic review of the literature.']"""

Methods:   Seventy-nine patients who underwent 3-T MRI and were histopathologically confirmed by microblocks were enrolled in this retrospective study. The index lesions were interpreted by two experienced radiologists. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were also noted. Weighted κ statistics were used to compare interreader agreement. Univariate logistic regression analysis was performed to define independent predictors of EPE status. Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were performed to compare the MRI-based methods and clinical variables (ISUP grade, prostate volume and PSA density) + MRI-based methods for pathologic EPE prediction by using the area under the curve (AUC) value.  Results:   The mean age was 64.5 years ± 6.2. 33/79 (41.8%) patients had pathologic EPE. As ESUR score showed weak interreader agreement (κ = 0.537), Likert scale, TCL, and EPE grade showed moderate agreement (κ = 0.608, κ = 0.747, κ = 0.647 respectively). Univariate ROC analysis result showed that all MRI-based score systems, mean ADC value, the ISUP grade, prostate volume, PSA density were the best variables in predicting EPE. ROC analysis results of four MRI-based methods showed good diagnostic performance. At multivariate analysis, all clinical models showed excellent diagnostic performance.

Methods:   A prospective nested case-control study used stored serum from 571 men who died of, or with history of, prostate cancer (cases), and 2169 matched controls. Total, free and intact PSA, human kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2), and microseminoprotein were measured and converted into MoM values.

Monte Carlo simulation used these in a risk-based algorithm to estimate screening performance (detection rates [DRs] and false-positive rates [FPRs]).  Results:   Almost all (99%) cases occurred aged ≥55. Marker values were similar in cases who did and did not die of prostate cancer. Combining age, total PSA and hK2 MoM values (other markers added little or no discrimination) yielded a 1.2% FPR (95% CI 0.2-4.8%) for a 90% DR (59-98%) in men who died of or with a prostate cancer diagnosis within 5 years of blood collection (risk cut-off 1 in 20), two-thirds less than the 4.5% FPR using total PSA alone measured in ng/ml for the same 90% DR (cut-off 3.1 ng/ml). Screening performance over 10 years yielded a 33% (22-46%) FPR for a 90% DR.  Conclusion:   Screening performed up to every 5 years from age 55 using the multi-marker risk-based screening algorithm for future prostate cancer achieves a high DR and a much lower FPR than using PSA alone, resulting in reductions in overdiagnosis and overtreatment.""","""['Nicholas J Wald', 'Jonathan P Bestwick', 'Joan K Morris']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Screen""","""['Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Impact of recent screening on predicting the outcome of prostate cancer biopsy in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen: data from the European Randomized Study of Prostate Cancer Screening in Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'A Four-kallikrein Panel and β-Microseminoprotein in Predicting High-grade Prostate Cancer on Biopsy: An Independent Replication from the Finnish Section of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'PSA and hK2 in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, the changes in gene expression profiles of multidrug resistant PCa cells that were established in response to docetaxel were determined using microarray analysis. In addition to alterations in the expression of multidrug resistance-associated genes, the expression levels of multiple inflammatory molecules, in particular IL-6, significantly increased in resistant cells in vitro and in vivo, which further increased with the development of drug resistance following microarray, qRT-PCR and ELISA analysis. Compared with parental cells, resistant cells also presented with stronger activation of multiple IL-6-associated signaling pathways STAT1/3, NF-κB, and PI3K/AKT. Inactivation of IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody resulted in a slight effect on the sensitivity of resistant cells to docetaxel, while blockade of of STAT1/3, NF-κB, or PI3K/AKT signaling significantly resensitized resistant cells to docetaxel. Of note, simultaneous inactivation of IL-6 and STAT1/3, PI3K/AKT or NF-κB further enhanced the sensitivity of the resistant cells to docetaxel. Thus, inflammatory molecules, in particular IL-6, and IL-6-associated signaling pathways NF-κB, STAT1/3, and PI3K/AKT, are crucial mediators of the development of docetaxel-resistance in PCa.

The objective of this study was to determine whether men taking 5-ARIs with regular health care access have increased prostate cancer mortality.  Methods:   We undertook two analyses in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study examining 5-ARI use, determined by biennial questionnaires, and prostate cancer. A cohort analysis followed 38,037 cancer-free men for prostate cancer incidence from 1996 through January 2017 and mortality through January 2019. A case-only analysis followed 4,383 men with localized/locally advanced prostate cancer for mortality over a similar period. HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for prostate cancer incidence and mortality.  Results:   Men using 5-ARIs underwent more PSA testing, prostate exams and biopsies. Over 20 years of follow-up, 509 men developed lethal disease (metastases or prostate cancer death). Among men initially free from prostate cancer, 5-ARI use was not associated with developing lethal disease [HR, 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.71-1.46], but was associated with reduced rates of overall and localized disease (HR, 0.71; 0.60-0.83). Among men diagnosed with prostate cancer, there was no association between 5-ARI use and cancer-specific (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.48-1.27) or overall survival (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72-1.07).  Conclusions:   Men using 5-ARIs were less likely to be diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer, without increasing long-term risk of lethal prostate cancer or cancer-specific death after diagnosis.

Methods:   In this multicenter, randomized controlled trial, prostate cancer patients were randomly assigned 3:1 to undergo either RARP or LRP. Patient-reported outcomes were prospectively collected before and 1, 3, 6, 12 months after radical prostatectomy and included QoL as a secondary outcome. Validated questionnaires were used to assess general health-related (EORTC QLQ-C30) and prostate cancer-specific (QLQ-PR25) QoL. Cross-sectional and longitudinal contrasts were analyzed through linear mixed models. Predictive variables for QoL outcomes were identified by general linear modeling.  Results:   Of 782 randomized patients, QoL was evaluable in 681 patients. In terms of general QoL, the cross-sectional analysis showed only small differences between study arms, whereas longitudinal comparison indicated an advantage of RARP on recovery: RARP patients reported an earlier return to baseline in global health status (3 vs. 6 months) and social functioning (6 vs. 12 months). In role functioning, only the RARP arm regained baseline scores. Regarding prostate-specific QoL, LRP patients experienced more urinary symptoms and reported 3.2 points (95% confidence interval 0.4-6, p = 0.024) higher mean scores at 1-month follow-up and in mean 2.9 points (0.1-5, p = 0.042) higher urinary symptoms scores at 3-month follow-up than RARP patients. There were no other significant differences between treatment groups. Urinary symptoms, sexual activity, and sexual function remained significantly worse compared with baseline at all time points in both arms.

While proven very effective for radiotracers, microdosing approaches the detection limit for fluorescence imaging. Thus, utility will be highly dependent on the tracer performance, the sensitivity of the fluorescence camera used, and the degree of background signal. Using a porcine model the ability to perform robot-assisted radical prostatectomy under fluorescence guidance using the bimodal or rather hybrid PSMA tracer (99mTc-EuK-(SO3)Cy5-mas3) was studied, while employing the tracer in a microdosing regime. This was followed by ex vivo evaluation in surgical specimens obtained from prostate cancer patients.  Results:   T50% blood and T50% urine were reached at 85 min and 390 min, in, respectively, blood and urine. Surgical fluorescence imaging allowed visualization of the prostate gland based on the basal PSMA-expression in porcine prostate. Together, in vivo visualization of the prostate and urinary excretion suggests at least an interval of > 7 h between tracer administration and surgery. Confocal microscopy of excised tissues confirmed tracer uptake in kidney and prostate, which was confirmed with PSMA IHC. No fluorescence was detected in other excised tissues. Tumor identification based on ex vivo fluorescence imaging of human prostate cancer specimens correlated with PSMA IHC.  Conclusion:   Intraoperative PSMA-mediated fluorescence imaging with a microdosing approach was shown to be feasible. Furthermore, EuK-(SO3)Cy5-mas3 allowed tumor identification in human prostate samples, underlining the translational potential of this novel tracer.

Overexpressed CDT1 can cause DNA damage through re-replication. However, the function of CDT1 in prostate cancer (PCa) development has not been established.  Methods:   Through bioinformatics, expression levels of CDT1 were found to be higher in metastatic PCa when compared to primary PCa. Then, immunohistochemical staining confirmed that the expression of CDT1 was significantly correlated with the occurrence of distant metastasis. For PCa cells, we established a stable clones knockdown CDT1. MTT was used in analyzing the proliferation ability of cells. Migration as well as invasion assays were performed. Effects of CDT1 knockdown on the cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. Expression levels of EMT-associated markers in PCa cells were determined by Western blotting. And PI3K/AKT/GSK3β, a signaling molecule recognized in PCa that can regulate EMT, was detected in protein level.  Results:   Over expression of CDT1 in PCa cells enhanced cell migration, invasion, tumor metastasis and was correlated with cell cycle regulation. Our results showed that knockdown of CDT1 inhibited G1 to S phase transition and induced the G1 phase cell cycle arrest in PCa cells. Moreover, it upregulated the expressions of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) and down-regulated mesenchymal markers (including Slug, N-cadherin, MMP2, vimentin, Snail, and MMP9) via regulating the phosphorylation level of PI3K, AKT and GSK3β.

Patient-derived tissue microarray immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on 729 commercially prepared tissue blocks of lung, colon, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovary cancers combined, plus a National Cancer Institute (NCI) tissue microarray derived from another 236 cases. The results confirmed that anti-labyrinthin mouse monoclonal MCA 44-3A6 antibody recognized adenocarcinomas, but not normal or non-adenocarcinoma cancer cells. The consensus of multiple topology analysis programs on labyrinthin (255 amino acids) estimate a type II cell membrane associated protein with an N-terminus signal peptide. However, because the labyrinthin sequence is enveloped within the 758 amino acids of the intracellular aspartyl/asparaginyl beta-hydroxylase (ASPH), a purported tumor associated antigen, standard IHC methods that permeabilize cells can expose common epitopes. To circumvent antibody cross-reactivity, cell surface labyrinthin was distinguished from intracellular ASPH by FACS analysis of permeabilized vs non-permeabilized cells. All permeabilized normal, adeno-and non-adenocarcinoma cells produced a strong MCA 44-3A6 binding signal, likely reflecting co-recognition of intracellular ASPH proteins along with internalized labyrinthin, but in non-permeabilized cells only adenocarcinoma cells were positive for labyrinthin. Confocal microscopy confirmed the FACS results. Labyrinthin as a functional cell-surface marker was suggested when: 1) WI-38 normal lung fibroblasts transfected with labyrinthin sense cDNA displayed a cancerous phenotype; 2) antisense transfection of A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells appeared more normal; and 3) MCA44-3A6 suppressed A549 cell proliferation. Collectively, the data indicate that labyrinthin is a unique, promising adenocarcinoma tumor-specific antigen and therapeutic target.

By analyzing The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)-PRAD, we found that the expression of INMT in prostate cancer was lower than that of adjacent non-cancerous prostate tissues and was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis Gleason score, PSA expression, and survival. Combined with the GSE46602 cohorts for pathway enrichment analysis, we found that INMT was involved in regulating the MAPK, TGFβ, and Wnt signaling pathways. After overexpression of INMT in prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and PC-3, we found an effect of INMT on these tumor signal pathways; overexpression of INMT inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and promoted apoptosis. Using the ESTIMATE algorithm, we found that with the increase of INMT expression, immune and stromal scores in the tumor microenvironment increased, immune response intensity increased, and tumor purity decreased. The difference in INMT expression affected the proportion of several immune cells. According to PRISM and CTRP2.0, the potential therapeutic agents associated with the INMT expression subgroup in TCGA were predicted. The area under the curve (AUC) values of 26 compounds positively correlated with the expression of INMT, while the AUC values of 14 compounds were negatively correlated with the expression of INMT.

Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) has always been considered a low-performance modality. To overcome this, a computerized artificial neural network analysis (ANNA/C-TRUS) of the TRUS based on an artificial intelligence (AI) analysis has been proposed. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ANNA/C-TRUS system and its ability to improve conventional TRUS in PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 64 patients with PCa and scheduled for radical prostatectomy who underwent TRUS followed by ANNA/C-TRUS analysis before the procedure. The results of ANNA/C-TRUS analysis with whole mount sections from final pathology.  Results:   On a per-sectors analysis, sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), positive predictive value (PPV) and accuracy were 62%, 81%, 80%, 64% and 78% respectively. The values for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer were 69%, 77%, 88%, 50% and 75%. The diagnostic values for high grade tumours were 70%, 74%, 91%, 41% and 74%, respectively. Cancer volume (≤ 0.5 or greater) did not influence the diagnostic performance of the ANNA/C-TRUS system.  Conclusions:   ANNA/C-TRUS represents a promising diagnostic tool and application of AI for PCa diagnosis. It improves the ability of conventional TRUS to diagnose prostate cancer, preserving its simplicity and availability.

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of PSM on biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) for patients who underwent PC for pT2 tumor without adjuvant treatment.  Methods:   We included each patient who underwent radical prostatectomy for pT2N0 PC between 1988 and 2018. Primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence (BR). BRFS was calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine factors associated with BR and PSM.  Results:   Overall, 2429 patients were included whom 420 patients had PSM (17.3%). Median follow-up was 116 months. BRFS at 10 years was 66.6% in case of PSM, and 84% in the negative margins group (P<0.0001). Parameters associated with BR were preoperative PSA level (P<0.0001), Gleason score (P<0.0001), tumor volume in biopsies, and margins length (P<0.04).  Conclusion:   PSM in pT2N0 CP are associated with poor prognosis in terms of BR. Nevertheless, only a small number of pT2R1 cancer will present biological recurrence. The use of adjuvant radiotherapy in these patients therefore represents a risk of overtreatment, with the risk of adverse effects inherent to irradiation. Clinical and biological monitoring in case of PSM seems acceptable.""","""['E Saïer', 'U Pinar', 'A De La Taille', 'J Irani', 'L Salomon']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prog Urol""","""['Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate cancer prognosis.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naïve patients.', 'Influence du score de Gleason des marges chirurgicales de prostatectomie totale sur la récidive biologique.', 'Radical prostatectomy for clinically localised prostate cancer at Rigshospitalet 1995-2011 - an analysis of surgical and oncological outcome.', 'Treatments around surgery of prostate cancer and surgery of recurrence.']"""

Unfortunately, this has come with a commensurate increase in the prevalence of osseous metastases and skeletal related events approaching 100,000 new patients each year. Patients are now experiencing serious morbidity and mortality due to pathologic fractures, altered structural mechanics, and cancer related bone pain. This patient population poses challenges for conventional open surgical and/or medical management often due to disease extent, location, and, in general, poor surgical candidacy. Percutaneous techniques may also be challenging under image guidance due to limited ability to use traditional orthopedic corridors, loss of cortical landmarks with destructive lesions, and need for live image guidance. Modern angiography suites with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and advanced imaging applications including needle guidance, 3D fusion, tumor segmentation, and angio-CT have facilitated the development of novel minimally invasive techniques for pain palliation and stabilization. The interventional radiologist is uniquely positioned to harness these advanced imaging applications and offer effective, safe, minimally invasive treatment options to patients with neoplastic disease within the axial, and appendicular skeletons.

Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and tumor and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses.  Results:   In total, 161 patients were enrolled. AZD8186 was well tolerated across all study arms, the most common adverse events being gastrointestinal symptoms.

Most cancer studies have used telomere length in leukocytes rather than in the target tissue of cancer origin.  Methods:   A case-control study of 524 case-control pairs with a benign prostate biopsy nested within a historical cohort of 10,478 men was conducted to determine whether premalignant prostate telomere length (assessed using a modified qRT-PCR) is associated with prostate cancer risk.  Results:   Telomere lengths in benign prostate biopsies of cases versus controls were similar (1.46 ± 0.38 vs. 1.45 ± 0.42; P = 0.49). African American (AA) men had significantly shorter telomeres compared with White men (1.51 ± 0.38 vs. 1.63 ± 0.39; P < 0.0001). In race-stratified analyses, increasing telomere length was more strongly associated with prostate cancer risk in White men, wherein those with telomere length in the highest quartile had 1.9-fold greater adjusted risk of prostate cancer compared with men with prostate telomere lengths in the lowest quartile [OR = 1.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-3.36]. Men in the highest telomere length quartile also had a greater risk of aggressive prostate cancer compared with men with telomere lengths in the lowest quartile (OR = 2.78; 95% CI = 1.25-6.19).  Conclusions:   White men have longer telomeres in benign prostate tissue compared with AA men, and those with the longest telomeres may be at increased risk for prostate cancer, particularly the more aggressive form of the disease.

From a regulatory perspective, data sets that cover a large chemical space and contain reference chemicals offer utility for the prediction of molecular initiating events associated with chemical exposure. Here, we integrate data from a large compendium of transcriptomic responses to chemical exposure with a comprehensive database of chemical-protein associations to train binary classifiers that predict mechanism(s) of action from transcriptomic responses. First, we linked reference chemicals present in the LINCS L1000 gene expression data collection to chemical identifiers in RefChemDB, a database of chemical-protein interactions. Next, we trained binary classifiers on MCF7 human breast cancer cell line derived gene expression profiles and chemical-protein labels using six classification algorithms to identify optimal analysis parameters. To validate classifier accuracy, we used holdout data sets, training-excluded reference chemicals, and empirical significance testing of null models derived from permuted chemical-protein associations. To identify classifiers that have variable predicting performance across training data derived from different cellular contexts, we trained a separate set of binary classifiers on the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line.  Results:   We trained classifiers using expression data associated with chemical treatments linked to 51 molecular initiating events. This analysis identified and validated 9 high-performing classifiers with empirical p-values lower than 0.05 and internal accuracies ranging from 0.73 to 0.94 and holdout accuracies of 0.68 to 0.92. High-ranking predictions for training-excluded reference chemicals demonstrating that predictive accuracy extends beyond the set of chemicals used in classifier training. To explore differences in classifier performance as a function of training data cellular context, MCF7-trained classifier accuracies were compared to classifiers trained on the PC3 gene expression data for the same molecular initiating events.  Conclusions:   This methodology can offer insight in prioritizing candidate perturbagens of interest for targeted screens.

In this study, we aimed to construct a prognostic model consisting of gene expression profiles to predict BCR-free survival.  Methods:   We analyzed 70 metabolic pathways in 152 normal prostate samples and 494 PCa samples from the UCSC Xena dataset (training set) via gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to select BCR-related genes and constructed a BCR-related gene risk score (RS) model. We tested the power of our model using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plots and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses of RS using other clinicopathological features and established a nomogram model, which has stronger prediction ability. We used GSE70770 and DFKZ 2018 datasets to validate the results. Finally, we performed differential expression and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses of the UCSC data for further verification of the findings.  Results:   A total of 194 core enriched genes were obtained through GSEA, among which 16 BCR-related genes were selected and a three-gene RS model based on the expression levels of CA14, LRAT, and MGAT5B was constructed. The outcomes of the K-M plots and ROC curves verified the accuracy of the RS model. We identified the Gleason score, pathologic T stage, and RS model as independent predictors through univariate and multivariate Cox analyses and constructed a nomogram model that presented better predictability than the RS model. The outcomes of the validation set were consistent with those of the training set. Finally, the results of differential expression analyses support the effectiveness of our model.  Conclusion:   We constructed an RS model based on metabolic genes that could predict the prognosis of PCa patients.

TUBB3, WDR62 and PPARGC1A were finally identified to establish the IGPI score. The IGPI score increased with the augment of the Gleason score and T stage, as well as biochemical recurrence (BCR) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Patients with a higher IGPI score were at a higher risk of progress (HR: 2·88; 95%CI: 95%CI: 1·80-4·61). Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that patients in high-risk group were positively associated with mismatch repair, cell cycle, DNA replication, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, homologous recombination and pyrimidine metabolism.

The response of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) to androgen receptor (AR)-directed hormonal treatments (i.e., enzalutamide and abiraterone) is mediated by the expression of a molecular variant of the androgen receptor called androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7). Detection and measurement of AR-V7 in mCRPC patients will lead to more informed PCa treatment. Herein, we demonstrate a quantitative nanoparticle-enhanced sandwich antibody assay for the successful ex vivo measurement of AR-V7 protein in serum from mCRPC patients. The nanoparticles are constructed as extrinsic Raman spectroscopy labels (ERLs), and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is used for assay readout. Our approach does not require specialized specimen collection materials, circulating tumor cell enrichment, or pretreatment of serum. Calibration of our assay is accomplished by expressing AR-V7 in an appropriate cell line as AR-V7 is not commercially available. We demonstrate a linear calibration curve from cell lysate and correlate lysate protein with mRNA from cultured prostate cancer cells. Finally, we demonstrate a novel pilot-scale application for clinical use by quantitatively measuring AR-V7 in serum of seven advanced PCa patients. Distinct separation of PCa patients by AR-V7 status (positive or negative) was observed. Together, the presence and amount of AR-V7 in serum offer predictive and prognostic value to inform selection between two classes of systemic treatments (i.e., hormones or taxanes). Triaging patients that are AR-V7-positive to other systemic treatments (e.g., taxane-based chemotherapy) can improve progression-free survival and overall survival.""","""['Sunil Rajput', 'Desmond Pink', 'Scott Findlay', 'Emma Woolner', 'John D Lewis', 'Mark T McDermott']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ACS Sens""","""['Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 and Efficacy of Taxane Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Nuclear-specific AR-V7 Protein Localization is Necessary to Guide Treatment Selection in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'CTC-derived AR-V7 detection as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Development of AR-V7 as a putative treatment selection marker for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Recent Trends in SERS-Based Plasmonic Sensors for Disease Diagnostics, Biomolecules Detection, and Machine Learning Techniques.']"""

The survival of patients with prostate cancer relies on detection at an early, treatable stage. In this paper, we introduce a new comprehensive framework to precisely differentiate between malignant and benign prostate cancer. This framework proposes a noninvasive computer-aided diagnosis system that integrates two imaging modalities of MR (diffusion-weighted (DW) and T2-weighted (T2W)). For the first time, it utilizes the combination of functional features represented by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps estimated from DW-MRI for the whole prostate in combination with texture features with its first- and second-order representations, extracted from T2W-MRIs of the whole prostate, and shape features represented by spherical harmonics constructed for the lesion inside the prostate and integrated with PSA screening results. The dataset presented in the paper includes 80 biopsy confirmed patients, with a mean age of 65.7 years (43 benign prostatic hyperplasia, 37 prostatic carcinomas). Experiments were conducted using different well-known machine learning approaches including support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), decision trees (DT), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classification models to study the impact of different feature sets that lead to better identification of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, the diagnostic results obtained using the SVM classification model along with the combined feature set after applying feature selection (88.75% accuracy, 81.08% sensitivity, 95.35% specificity, and 0.8821 AUC) indicated that the system's performance, after integrating and reducing different types of feature sets, obtained an enhanced diagnostic performance compared with each individual feature set and other machine learning classifiers. In addition, the developed diagnostic system provided consistent diagnostic performance using 10-fold and 5-fold cross-validation approaches, which confirms the reliability, generalization ability, and robustness of the developed system.""","""['Sarah M Ayyad', 'Mohamed A Badawy', 'Mohamed Shehata', 'Ahmed Alksas', 'Ali Mahmoud', 'Mohamed Abou El-Ghar', 'Mohammed Ghazal', 'Moumen El-Melegy', 'Nahla B Abdel-Hamid', 'Labib M Labib', 'H Arafat Ali', 'Ayman El-Baz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sensors (Basel)""","""['Characterisation of prostate cancer using texture analysis for diagnostic and prognostic monitoring.', 'Automated prostate cancer detection via comprehensive multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging texture feature models.', 'Bi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging based radiomics for the identification of benign and malignant prostate lesions: cross-vendor validation.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Anatomically guided self-adapting deep neural network for clinically significant prostate cancer detection on bi-parametric MRI: a multi-center study.', 'Construction of machine learning-based models for cancer outcomes in low and lower-middle income countries: A scoping review.', 'Special Issue ""Computer Aided Diagnosis Sensors"".', 'A Novel System for Precise Grading of Glioma.', 'Identidication of novel biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer using machine learning.']"""

However, TERT, the catalytic protein component of the reverse transcriptase telomerase, itself does not suit as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer as it is rather low expressed. We investigated if, instead of TERT, transcription factors regulating TERT may suit as prognostic markers. To identify transcription factors regulating TERT, we developed and applied a new gene regulatory modeling strategy to a comprehensive transcriptome dataset of 445 primary PCa. Six transcription factors were predicted as TERT regulators, and most prominently, the developmental morphogenic factor PITX1. PITX1 expression positively correlated with telomere staining intensity in PCa tumor samples. Functional assays and chromatin immune-precipitation showed that PITX1 activates TERT expression in PCa cells. Clinically, we observed that PITX1 is an excellent prognostic marker, as concluded from an analysis of more than 15,000 PCa samples.

This study aimed to investigate the anti-tumor activity of beta-blockers on prostate and bladder cancer. Prostate and bladder cancer cell lines were cultured and treated with beta-blocker (propranolol). Then, protein levels and activity of apoptotic pathway mediators and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway mediators were analyzed by ELISA. Propranolol treatment elevated the activity of caspase-3 and expression of bax, Wee1, GADD153 and apoptosis-inducing factor, but decreased bcl-2 which is an antiapoptotic protein. Propranolol treatment also inhibited ERK and JNK activity.

Curcumin (CUR) is a well-known phytochemical, and scorpion venom (SV) is a natural peptide with proven anticancer properties. However, these natural bioactive agents are limited by low solubility, low bioavailability, poor thermal stability, and short half-lives. Therefore, the aim of this study was to fabricate SV-conjugated CUR phytosomes as promising functionalized nanovesicles and assess their anticancer efficacy in human prostatic cancer PC3 cells. CUR-Phytosome-SV was fabricated using experimental design software in which the zeta potential and particle sizes were used as dependent variables. The anticancer effect of the fabricated formulation was determined by performing a tetrazolium (MTT) assay, cell cycle analysis, annexin V staining, and examining the expression levels of Bcl-associated X-protein (Bax), p53, caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), nuclear factor kappa beta (NF-kB), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). The particle size of the nanoconjugates was found to be in the range of 137.5 ± 7.9 to 298.4 ± 11.9 nm, and the zeta potential was 2.9 ± 0.1 to 26.9 ± 1.2 mV. The outcome of the MTT assay showed that curcumin-Phospholipon®-scorpion venom (CUR-PL-SV) exhibited a satisfactory level of cytotoxicity, and the IC50 was found to be lower than CUR and PL-SV individually. Cell cycle analysis showed predominantly cell cycle arrest at the G2-M and pre-G1 phases. In contrast, annexin V staining showed significant early and late apoptosis events in addition to increased necrosis when PC3 cells were treated with CUR-PL-SV. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed a reduction in expression of Bax, p53, caspase-3, NF-kB, TNF-α, and an increase in Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, a MMP analysis showed a reduction in mitochondrial permeability and hence confirmed the superior anticancer potential of CUR-PL-SV.

The mean MUL in sagittal and coronal planes was 11.31 mm (SD: 2.6, range: 6-17 mm) and 11.43 mm (SD: 2.94, range: 5-17 mm) in patients who had AUS and MS, respectively; 15.23 mm (SD: 4.2, range: 8.25-25 mm) and 15.75 mm (SD: 4.1, range: 8-24 mm) in controls (p < 0.01). No men in the PPI surgery group had an MUL >17 mm compared to 35% (20/57 sagittal, 20/58 coronal) of controls. The odds ratio for requiring surgery for PPI was 13.4 for sagittal MUL <9 mm and 3.2 if the MUL <12 mm.  Conclusions:   Patients who had surgery for PPI had a significantly shorter MUL and sphincter volume than continent controls. Men with an MUL >17 mm are unlikely to require surgery for PPI whereas an MUL <12 mm significantly increases the risk of requiring surgery for PPI. MUL should be considered when discussing treatment options for prostate cancer.""","""['Priyanka Oza', 'Nicholas Faure Walker', 'Giles Rottenberg', 'Findlay MacAskill', 'Sachin Malde', 'Claire Taylor', 'Arun Sahai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Neurourol Urodyn""","""['Corrigendum.', 'Factors contributing to treatment outcomes of post-prostatectomy incontinence surgery for the selection of the proper surgical procedure for individual patients: A single-center experience.', 'Synthetic sling or artificial urinary sphincter for men with urodynamic stress incontinence after prostate surgery: the MASTER non-inferiority RCT.', 'Male synthetic sling versus artificial urinary sphincter trial for men with urodynamic stress incontinence after prostate surgery (MASTER): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.', 'Surgical Treatment of Male Postprostatectomy Incontinence: Current Concepts.', 'The artificial urinary sphincter and male sling for postprostatectomy incontinence: Which patient should get which procedure?', 'Corrigendum.']"""

From April 2017 to January 2021, 40 patients with oligorecurrent prostate cancer detected by PSMA-PET were treated with SBRT for bone oligometastases. Concurrent androgen deprivation therapy was an exclusion criterion. A total of 56 prostate cancer bone oligometastases were included in the present analysis. In 28 patients (70%), oligometastatic disease presented as a single lesion, two lesions in 22.5%, three lesions in 5%, four lesions in 2.5%. 30.3% were spine-metastases, while 69.7% were non-spine metastases. SBRT was delivered for a median dose of 30 Gy (24-40 Gy) in 3-5 fractions, with a median EQD2 = 85 Gy2 (64.3-138.9Gy2). With a median follow-up of 22 months (range 2-48 months), local control (LC) 1- and 2-years rates were 96.3% and 93.9%, while distant progression-free survival (DPFS) rates were 45.3% and 27%. At multivariate analysis, the lower PSA nadir value after SBRT remained significantly related to better DPFS rates (p = 0.03).

A new treatment strategy is urgently needed for patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer, particularly an approach that combines two drugs with different mechanisms. Combinations of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy have shown synergistic effects in clinical trials, but are limited by off-target toxicity. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a well-established biomarker for prostate cancer. Here we describe the use of a PSMA ligand to selectively and simultaneously deliver a potent microtubule inhibiting agent, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), and a PDT agent, IR700, to prostate cancers. Methods: Using a bifunctional PSMA ligand PSMA-1-Cys-C6-Lys, we created a novel theranostic molecule PSMA-1-MMAE-IR700. The molecule was tested in vitro and in vivo for selectivity and antitumor activity studies. Results: PSMA-1-MMAE-IR700 showed selective and specific uptake in PSMA-positive PC3pip cells, but not in PSMA-negative PC3flu cells both in vitro and in vivo. In in vitro cytotoxicity studies, when exposed to 690 nm light, PSMA-1-MMAE-IR700 demonstrated a synergistic effect leading to greater cytotoxicity for PC3pip cells when compared to PSMA-1-IR700 with light irradiation or PSMA-1-MMAE-IR700 without light irradiation. In vivo antitumor activity studies further showed that PSMA-1-MMAE-IR700 with light irradiation significantly inhibited PC3pip tumor growth and prolonged survival time as compared to mice receiving an equimolar amount of PSMA-1-IR700 with light irradiation or PSMA-1-IR700-MMAE without light irradiation. Conclusion: We have synthesized a new multifunctional theranostic molecule that combines imaging, chemotherapy, and PDT for therapy against PSMA-expressing cancer tissues.

Methods: Bidirectional transference of lipids, proteins and RNA between platelets and tumor cells and its impact on tumor cell behavior and tumor process are analyzed in this work. Phenotypic, genetic and functional modifications induced by platelets were analyzed both in tumor cell lines and in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Results: Data from these assays showed that platelets transferred structural components to tumor cells with higher efficiency than tumor cells to platelets (p = 0.001). This biological interplay occurred by direct contact, internalization or via extracellular vesicles. As a result, tumor cells acquired platelet markers (CD61 and CD42), showed decreased EpCAM, expressed epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, and increased proliferation rates. Moreover, we were able to detect CD61 in CTCs from early and advanced prostate cancer. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated, for the first time, that platelets educate tumor cells by highly efficient transference of lipids, proteins and RNA through different mechanisms.

In situ hybridization (ISH) was performed to detect the expression of NEAT1 in PCa and paracarcinoma clinical samples. Then, NEAT1 was knocked down in PC3 cells through lentiviral infection with a plasmid construct. Bioinformatics and integrative analytical approaches were utilized to identify the relationships of NEAT1 with specific cancer-related gene sets. Cell proliferation assay and colony formation assay were performed to evaluate the cell proliferative ability. Glycolysis stress test, metabolism assay, and infiltrating T-cell function analysis were implemented to assess the changes in metabolism and immune microenvironment of PCa. We found that the expression of NEAT1 was higher in PCa than in non-neoplastic tissues. The cell proliferative capability of PCa cells was significantly reduced in the NEAT1 knockdown group. PCR array and bioinformatics analysis revealed that the enrichment of acidic substance-related gene sets was associated with NEAT1 expression. NEAT1 depletion inhibited PCa cell aerobic glycolysis accompanied by the reduction of lactate levels in the medium. Further, we found that lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) expression was positively regulated by NEAT1. At last, co-culture systems indicated that NEAT1 or LDHA knockdown promoted the secretion of CD8+ T-lymphocyte factors, including TNF-α, IFN-γ, and Granzyme B, and enhanced the antitumor effects.""","""['Kai-Guo Xia', 'Chang-Ming Wang', 'De-Yun Shen', 'Xiao-Yuan Song', 'Xiang-Yu Mu', 'Jia-Wei Zhou', 'An-Yang Zhu', 'Qiang Xuan', 'Tao Tao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Neoplasma""","""['Long non-coding RNA-NEAT1, a sponge for miR-98-5p, promotes expression of oncogene HMGA2 in prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA nuclear-enriched abundant transcript 1 shuttled by prostate cancer cells-secreted exosomes initiates osteoblastic phenotypes in the bone metastatic microenvironment via miR-205-5p/runt-related transcription factor 2/splicing factor proline- and glutamine-rich/polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 axis.', 'Inhibition of lncRNA-NEAT1 sensitizes 5-Fu resistant cervical cancer cells through de-repressing the microRNA-34a/LDHA axis.', 'Long non‑coding RNA NEAT1 modifies cell proliferation, colony formation, apoptosis, migration and invasion via the miR‑4500/BZW1 axis in ovarian cancer.', 'The Long and the Short of It: NEAT1 and Cancer Cell Metabolism.', 'LINC00659 Inhibits Hepatocellular Carcinoma Malignant Progression by Blocking Aerobic Glycolysis through FUS Recruitment and SLC10A1 Modulation.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Noncoding RNAs Controlling Oxidative Stress in Cancer.', 'A lactate-related LncRNA model for predicting prognosis, immune landscape and therapeutic response in breast cancer.']"""

The validation cohort included 103 men from another hospital. Adverse pathology outcome was defined either by upgrading on RP Gleason Score (GS) (from GS 3+3 to GS ≥ 3+4 with Gleason pattern 4 ≥ 10%) or a non-organ confined disease (pathologic stage ≥ pT3a). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to build nomogram for predicting adverse pathology outcome. Nomogram validation was performed by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and comparing nomogram-predicted probabilities with actual rates of adverse pathology outcome in the external cohort. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate and compare the biochemical recurrence-free survival rates between the two groups.  Results:   Of 426 men in the development cohort, 45.7% showed adverse pathology outcome on RP.

However, monotherapy with IL15 was ineffective in patients with cancer, indicating that it would have to be used in combination with other anticancer agents. The administration of high doses of common gamma chain cytokines, such as IL15, is associated with the generation of ""helpless"" antigen-nonspecific CD8 T cells. The generation of the tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells can be mediated by CD40 signaling via agonistic anti-CD40 antibodies. Nevertheless, parenteral administration of anti-CD40 antibodies is associated with unacceptable side effects, such as thrombocytopenia and hepatic toxicity, which can be avoided by intratumoral administration.  Experimental design:   We investigated the combination of IL15 with an intratumoral anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (mAb) in a dual tumor TRAMP-C2 murine prostate cancer model and expanded the regimen to include an anti-PD-1 mAb.  Results:   Here we demonstrated that anti-CD40 given intratumorally not only showed significant antitumor activity in treated tumors, but also noninjected contralateral tumors, indicative of abscopal efficacy. The combination of IL15 with intratumoral anti-CD40 showed an additive immune response with an increase in the number of tumor-specific tetramer-positive CD8 T cells. Furthermore, the addition of anti-PD-1 further improved efficacy mediated by the anti-CD40/IL15 combination.

Results:   The median age of the patients was 65 (60-70) years. TBx and concomitant SBx were performed in 78 (82.1%) patients, while 16 (16.8%) patients underwent SBx alone and one (1.1%) patient underwent TBx alone. The frequency of PNI in TBx and SBx was 17 (21.5%) and 32 (34.0%), respectively. The specificity/negative predictive values of PNI for surgical margin positivity, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion were 79.7/88.7%, 92.5/79.0%, and 83.3/96.8%, in TBx, and 71.1/87.1%, 80.7/74.2%, and 69.5/91.9%, in SBx, respectively. There was also a statistically significant correlation between PNI in biopsy and surgical margin positivity, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle invasion in prostatectomy as well as the ISUP grade group and pT stage.  Conclusions:   The absence of PNI in prostate needle biopsy may predict localized PCa with a pT stage ≤ 2c and negative surgical margins in contrast to its presence which appears to be an indicator of unfavorable factors in final pathology.""","""['N Karsiyakali', 'M Bulent Ozgen', 'B Ozveren', 'C Akbal', 'A Dincer', 'H Durak', 'L Turkeri']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Transperineal multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion-targeted prostate biopsy combined with standard template improves perineural invasion detection.', 'Perineural invasion on prostate biopsy does not predict adverse pathological outcome.', 'Suboptimal Prediction of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Radical Prostatectomy Specimens by mpMRI-Targeted Biopsy.', 'Prostate cancer reporting and staging: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.']"""

Materials and methods:   We selected men at high risk for genetic mutations from 1515 Hispanic men enrolled in the San Antonio Biomarkers of Risk for prostate cancer (SABOR) cohort. Inclusion criteria included men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer or a first-degree family history of prostate cancer. We performed germline genetic testing using the Color Genomics platform, sequencing 30 genes associated with hereditary cancer risk. Additionally, we assessed ancestral informative markers to determine the admixture of the ethnically unique cohort.  Results:   Of the 275 subjects who met selection criteria, 263 patients had sufficient samples for sequencing. We identified 3.8% of patients (10 of 263) with a pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutation in the 30 genes tested, of whom 70% would not have met established criteria for genetic testing. Six of these mutations were in BRCA1/2 or ATM. There was a significant inverse association between the percentage of Native American ancestry and the risk of prostate cancer, OR 0.11 (95% CI 0.02-0.76, P = .025).

However, the clinical significance and biological function of miR-5195-3p in prostate cancer (PCa) have not been reported yet.  Methods:   The expression levels of miR-5195-3p and Cyclin L1 (CCNL1) were determined using quantitative real-time PCR in clinical specimens and cell lines. The clinical significance of miR-5195-3p in patients with PCa was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models. Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were measured by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. The association between miR-5195-3p and CCNL1 was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   MiR-5195-3p expression levels were significantly downregulated in 69 paired PCa tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues. The decreased miR-5195-3p expression was associated with Gleason score and TNM stage, as well as worse survival prognosis. The in vitro experiments showed that miR-5195-3p overexpression suppressed the proliferation and cell cycle G1/S transition in PC-3 and DU145 cells. Elevated miR-5195-3p abundance obviously impaired tumor formation in vivo using PC-3 xenografts. Mechanistically, CCNL1 was a direct target of miR-5195-3p in PCa cells, which was inversely correlated with miR-5195-3p in PCa tissues. Importantly, CCNL1 knockdown imitated, while overexpression reversed, the effects of miR-5195-3p overexpression on PCa cell proliferation and cell cycle G1/S transition.

Purpose To investigate the feasibility of time-dependent diffusion MRI-based microstructural mapping for noninvasively characterizing cellular properties of PCa and for discriminating between clinically significant PCa and clinically insignificant disease. Materials and Methods Men with a clinical suspicion of PCa were enrolled prospectively between October 2019 and August 2020. Time-dependent diffusion MRI data were acquired with pulsed and oscillating gradient diffusion MRI sequences at an equivalent diffusion time of 7.5-30 msec on a 3.0-T scanner. Time-dependent diffusion MRI-based microstructural parameters, including cell diameter, intracellular volume fraction, cellularity, and diffusivities, were estimated with a two-compartment model. These were compared for different International Society of Urological Pathology grade groups (GGs), and their performance in discriminating clinically significant PCa (GG >1) from clinically insignificant disease (benign and GG 1) was determined with a linear discriminant analysis. The fitted microstructural parameters were validated by means of correlation with histopathologic measurements. Results In the 48 enrolled men, the time-dependent diffusion MRI measurements showed that higher GG was correlated with higher intracellular volume fraction and higher cellularity (intracellular volume fraction = 0.22, 0.36, 0.34, 0.37, and 0.40 in GGs 1-5, respectively; P < .001 at one-way analysis of variance), while lower cell diameter was found at higher GGs (diameter = 23.4, 18.3, 19.2, 17.9, and 18.5 μm in GGs 1-5, respectively; P = .002). Among all measurements derived from time-dependent diffusion MRI, cellularity achieved the highest diagnostic performance, with an accuracy of 92% (44 of 48 participants) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 0.99) in discriminating clinically significant PCa from clinically insignificant disease. Microstructural mapping was supported by positive correlations between time-dependent diffusion MRI-based and pathologic examination-based intracellular volume fraction (r = 0.83; P < .001).

However, selective sampling of surface proteins for proteomics requires large samples (>10e6 cells) and long labeling times. These limitations preclude analysis of material-limited biological samples or the capture of rapid surface proteomic changes. Here, we present two labeling approaches to tether exogenous peroxidases (APEX2 and HRP) directly to cells, enabling rapid, small-scale cell surface biotinylation without the need to engineer cells. We used a novel lipidated DNA-tethered APEX2 (DNA-APEX2), which upon addition to cells promoted cell agnostic membrane-proximal labeling. Alternatively, we employed horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fused to the glycan-binding domain of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-HRP). This approach yielded a rapid and commercially inexpensive means to directly label cells containing common N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and sialic acid glycans on their surface. The facile WGA-HRP method permitted high surface coverage of cellular samples and enabled the first comparative surface proteome characterization of cells and cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (EVs), leading to the robust quantification of 953 cell and EV surface annotated proteins. We identified a newly recognized subset of EV-enriched markers, as well as proteins that are uniquely upregulated on Myc oncogene-transformed prostate cancer EVs. These two cell-tethered enzyme surface biotinylation approaches are highly advantageous for rapidly and directly labeling surface proteins across a range of material-limited sample types.""","""['Lisa L Kirkemo#', 'Susanna K Elledge#', 'Jiuling Yang', 'James R Byrnes', 'Jeff E Glasgow', 'Robert Blelloch', 'James A Wells']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Elife""","""['Proteomic dissection of large extracellular vesicle surfaceome unravels interactive surface platform.', 'A light and electron microscopic study of the intraneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase and wheat germ agglutinin-peroxidase conjugates in the rat visual system.', 'Transneuronal transport of wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in the somatosensory system of the rat: a light- and electron-microscopic study.', 'Extracellular Vesicle Proteome in Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Analysis of Mass Spectrometry Studies.', 'Experimental and Biological Insights from Proteomic Analyses of Extracellular Vesicle Cargos in Normalcy and Disease.', '(Glycan Binding) Activity-Based Protein Profiling in Cells Enabled by Mass Spectrometry-Based Proteomics.', 'SLAPSHOT reveals rapid dynamics of extracellularly exposed proteome in response to calcium-activated plasma membrane phospholipid scrambling.']"""

Results:   We found that the expression of 4E-BP1 and p4E-BP1 was higher in prostate cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Interestingly, the expression of p4E-BP1 was significantly associated with Gleason score and lymph node metastasis, but had no obvious correlation with PSA and the presence of bone or visceral metastasis. However, no evident correlation was found between the positive expression of 4E-BP1 and these clinical characteristics. In in vitro experiments, we found similar results as the clinical presentation that 4E-BP1 and p4E-BP1 were low expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells, but in prostate cancer cells, as the malignancy increasing, 4E-BP1 and p4E-BP1 expression also gradually increased. Then, we used Everolimus to inhibit the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and found that Everolimus effectively reduced cloning formation, inhibited cell migration, and promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in PC3 cells.

Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analysis were used to evaluate the impact of prior malignancy on the prognosis of ICC patients.  Results:   A total of 9667 ICC patients were identified; among them, 782 (8.09%) had a history of prior cancer. Prostate, breast, colorectal, bladder, and liver/gallbladder/other biliary cancers were the most common types of prior cancer. Patients with prior cancer had better tumor-related profiles than those without prior cancer, namely, the former patients showed a lower proportion of positive AFP levels and vascular invasion, a lower AJCC stage, a smaller tumor size, and a lower stage of tumor grade. The median survival times after the diagnosis of ICC were 10 and 11.5 months for patients with and without prior cancer, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis suggested that prior cancer did not contribute to inferior overall survival (OS, HR 0.870, 95% CI 0.797-0.950, and p = 0.002) or cancer-specific survival (CSS, HR 0.820, 95% CI 0.741-0.906, and p < 0.001).

Liquid biopsy analysis of miRNAs is a fast-developing field with a considerable likelihood to predict tumor progression and metastasis by targeting genes involved in oncogenesis.  Patients and methods:   Differential expression analysis of miRNAs profile in CRPC patients was performed by creating small RNA libraries of circulating miRNAs using HiSeq2500 Illumina platform. A secondary analysis of aligned reads with miRNA identification and quantification was performed using miARmaSeq. Using the Bowtie algorithm, the selected variants were compared to reference nucleotide sequence GRCh38 and miRbase. Novel miRNA sequences were structurally analyzed using mirDeep2®.  Results:   A total of 16 patients with CRPC were included for analysis. Identified circulating miRNAs were hsa-miR-885-3p, hsa-miR-4467, hsa-miR-4686, hsa-miR-146a-3p, hsa-miR-6514-5p. Genes identified as regulated by these miRNAs were GPR56, BDNF, CTNND1, C17orf62, and DTNA.  Conclusion:   We explored the miRNA expression profile in patients with CRPC, identifying five miRNAs implicated in the regulation of genes involved in prostate cancer (PCa) oncogenesis and progression. We also found miRNA 855-3p in peripheral blood for the first time, which has a critical role in tumor growth mechanisms and higher expression profile than in healthy individuals.""","""['Nicolas Fernandez', 'Julian Chavarriaga', 'Paola Ayala', 'Adriana Pedraza', 'John Bolivar', 'Juan Guillermo Prada', 'Juan Guillermo Cataño', 'Herney Andres García-Perdomo', 'Juliana Villanueva', 'Daniela Varela', 'Ignacio Zarante']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Res Rep Urol""","""['Functional roles and potential clinical application of miRNA-345-5p in prostate cancer.', 'The Identification of Plasma Exosomal miR-423-3p as a Potential Predictive Biomarker for Prostate Cancer Castration-Resistance Development by Plasma Exosomal miRNA Sequencing.', 'Dysregulated Serum MiRNA Profile and Promising Biomarkers in Dengue-infected Patients.', 'Identification of Key MicroRNAs and Mechanisms in Prostate Cancer Evolution Based on Biomarker Prioritization Model and Carcinogenic Survey.', 'MicroRNAs in oral fluids (saliva and gingival crevicular fluid) as biomarkers in orthodontics: systematic review and integrated bioinformatic analysis.', ""Novel microRNAs modulating ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression.""]"""

Treatments that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) have been approved for human cancers with clinical benefit. However, many patients, especially prostate cancer, fail to respond to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, so it is an urgent need to seek a support strategy for improving the traditional PD-1/PD-L1 targeting immunotherapy. In the present study, analyzing the data from our prostate cancer tissue microarray, we found that PD-L1 expression was positively correlated with the expression of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (HnRNP L). Hence, we further investigated the potential role of HnRNP L on the PD-L1 expression, the sensitivity of cancer cells to T-cell killing and the synergistic effect with anti-PD-1 therapy in CRPC. Indeed, HnRNP L knockdown effectively decreased PD-L1 expression and recovered the sensitivity of cancer cells to T-cell killing in vitro and in vivo, on the contrary, HnRNP L overexpression led to the opposite effect in CRPC cells. In addition, consistent with the previous study, we revealed that ferroptosis played a critical role in T-cell-induced cancer cell death, and HnRNP L promoted the cancer immune escape partly through targeting YY1/PD-L1 axis and inhibiting ferroptosis in CRPC cells. Furthermore, HnRNP L knockdown enhanced antitumor immunity by recruiting infiltrating CD8+ T cells and synergized with anti-PD-1 therapy in CRPC tumors. This study provided biological evidence that HnRNP L knockdown might be a novel therapeutic agent in PD-L1/PD-1 blockade strategy that enhanced anti-tumor immune response in CRPC.""","""['Xumin Zhou', 'Libin Zou', 'Hangyu Liao', 'Junqi Luo', 'Taowei Yang', 'Jun Wu', 'Wenbin Chen', 'Kaihui Wu', 'Shengren Cen', 'Daojun Lv', 'Fangpeng Shu', 'Yu Yang', 'Chun Li', 'Bingkun Li', 'Xiangming Mao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Pharm Sin B""","""['Flubendazole, FDA-approved anthelmintic, elicits valid antitumor effects by targeting P53 and promoting ferroptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combined treatment with anti-PSMA CAR NK-92 cell and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody enhances the antitumour efficacy against castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of IL-6-JAK/Stat3 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells enhances the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity via alteration of PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Cases were randomized into two groups: 80% (548 cases) as the development group, and 20% (149 cases) as the validation group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent risk factors for prostate cancer. The nomogram prediction model was generated using the finalized independent risk factors. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) of both development group and validation group were calculated and compared to validate the accuracy and efficiency of the nomogram prediction model.

Gene expression profiling has been demonstrated the ability to classify multiple tumor types. The present study aims to assess the performance of a 90-gene expression test for tumor classification (i.e. the determination of tumor tissue of origin) in real clinical settings.  Methods:   Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples and associated clinicopathologic information were collected from three cancer centers between January 2016 and January 2021. A total of 1417 specimens that met quality control criteria (RNA quality, tumor cell content ≥ 60% and so on) were analyzed by the 90-gene expression test to identify the tumor tissue of origin. The performance was evaluated by comparing the test results with histopathological diagnosis.  Results:   The 1417 samples represent 21 main tumor types classified by common tissue origins and anatomic sites. Overall, the 90-gene expression test reached an accuracy of 94.4% (1338/1417, 95% CI: 0.93 to 0.96).

Patient and methods:   Retrospective analysis of trials using androgen receptor axis-targeted drugs for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients (mCRPC). aBSI increase in bone disease was assessed from baseline scan to time-to-progression (per PCWG criteria). Threshold for time to aBSI increase were explored and the association between each time-to-threshold and OS was computed.  Results:   A total of 169 mCPRC patients had bone scans available for aBSI analysis. Of these, 90 (53%) had progression in bone meeting PCWG criteria. Total aBSI increase in patients meeting PCWG criteria was 1.22 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.65-2.49), with a median relative increase of 109% (IQR: 40%-377%). Median aBSI at baseline was 3.1 (IQR: 1.3-7.1). The best association between OS and time-to-progression occurred with an absolute increase in aBSI equal to 0.6 (Kendall's tau 0.52).  Conclusion:   An absolute increase of 0.6 or more in aBSI from the first follow-up scan results in the highest association with OS in patients with mCRPC. The rPFS by PCWG, identified progression at nearly twice this tumor burden, suggesting that aBSI may be used to further develop the PCWG criteria without degrading its association with OS.""","""['Aseem Anand', 'Glenn Heller', 'Joseph Fox', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Lars Edenbrandt', 'Steven M Larson', 'Howard I Scher', 'Michael J Morris']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Phase 3 Assessment of the Automated Bone Scan Index as a Prognostic Imaging Biomarker of Overall Survival in Men With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Radiographic progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-2 criteria as an intermediate endpoint for drug development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Assessing Radiographic Response to 223Ra with an Automated Bone Scan Index in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Measuring the unmeasurable: automated bone scan index as a quantitative endpoint in prostate cancer clinical trials.', 'Monitoring the clinical outcomes in advanced prostate cancer: what imaging modalities and other markers are reliable?']"""

However, data on the prevalence of cancer are very scarce. Kidney transplantation improves quality of life, prolongs survival, and is cost-effective but bears some serious complications including malignancy. Therefore, active screening for cancer is of utmost importance. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of malignancy in dialyzed patients in relation to status on the on the waiting list and type of dialysis. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 108 hemodialyzed patients (mean age 65 years, 47 women) and 47 peritoneally dialyzed patients (mean age 51 years, 25 women). Among the population studied, 20 patients were actively waitlisted, including 14 peritoneal dialysis patients. Patients who had been active on the cadaver kidney waiting list and not listed did not differ in regard to sex, dialysis vintage, and causes of end-stage renal failure, but were significantly younger. Among hemodialysis patients, 24 of them had a history of malignancy and 10 in the peritoneal dialysis population. The most common were renal cell carcinoma in 6, breast cancer in 4, lung cancer in 3, prostate cancer in 3, hepatocellular cancer in 2, colorectal cancer in 2, esophageal cancer in 2, and others 14. In waitlisted patients, only 2 hemodialysis patients had a history of malignancy. Waitlisted patients represent a very selected and healthier dialyzed population. Malignancy has become a more common comorbidity in dialyzed patients, which may have important clinical implication regarding therapy.

In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, SCC is a clinically significant cause of disease-related morbidity and mortality. We investigated whether screening for SCC with spinal MRI, and pre-emptive treatment if radiological SCC (rSCC) was detected, reduced the incidence of clinical SCC (cSCC) in asymptomatic patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and spinal metastasis.  Methods:   We did a parallel-group, open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3, superiority trial. Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were recruited from 45 National Health Service hospitals in the UK. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years, with an Eastern Co-operative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, asymptomatic spinal metastasis, no previous SCC, and no spinal MRI in the past 12 months. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a minimisation algorithm with a random element (balancing factors were treatment centre, alkaline phosphatase [normal vs raised, with the upper limit of normal being defined at each participating laboratory], number of previous systemic treatments [first-line vs second-line or later], previous spinal treatment, and imaging of thorax and abdomen), to no MRI (control group) or screening spinal MRI (intervention group). Serious adverse events were monitored in the 24 h after screening MRI in the intervention group. Participants with screen-detected rSCC were offered pre-emptive treatment (radiotherapy or surgical decompression was recommended per treating physician's recommendation) and 6-monthly spinal MRI. All patients were followed up every 3 months, and then at month 30 and 36. The primary endpoint was time to and incidence of confirmed cSCC in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all patients randomly assigned), with the primary timepoint of interest being 1 year after randomisation. The study is registered with ISRCTN, ISRCTN74112318, and is now complete.  Findings:   Between Feb 26, 2013, and April 25, 2017, 420 patients were randomly assigned to the control (n=210) or screening MRI (n=210) groups. Median age was 74 years (IQR 68 to 79), 222 (53%) of 420 patients had normal alkaline phosphatase, and median prostate-specific antigen concentration was 48 ng/mL (IQR 17 to 162). Screening MRI detected rSCC in 61 (31%) of 200 patients with assessable scans in the intervention group. As of data cutoff (April 23, 2020), at a median follow-up of 22 months (IQR 13 to 31), time to cSCC was not significantly improved with screening (hazard ratio 0·64 [95% CI 0·37 to 1·11]; Gray's test p=0·12). 1-year cSCC rates were 6·7% (95% CI 3·8-10·6; 14 of 210 patients) for the control group and 4·3% (2·1-7·7; nine of 210 patients) for the intervention group (difference -2·4% [95% CI -4·2 to 0·1]). Median time to cSCC was not reached in either group. No serious adverse events were reported within 24 h of screening.  Interpretation:   Despite the substantial incidence of rSCC detected in the intervention group, the rate of cSCC in both groups was low at a median of 22 months of follow-up. Routine use of screening MRI and pre-emptive treatment to prevent cSCC is not warranted in patients with asymptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with spinal metastasis.

The systems allow online adaption of the treatment plan with the aim of compensating for interfractional anatomical changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dose volume histogram (DVH)-based dosimetric benefits of online adaptive MR-guided radiotherapy (oMRgRT) across different tumor entities and to investigate which subgroup of plans improved the most from adaption.  Methods:   Fifty patients treated with oMRgRT for five different tumor entities (liver, lung, multiple abdominal lymph nodes, pancreas, and prostate) were included in this retrospective analysis. Various target volume (gross tumor volume GTV, clinical target volume CTV, and planning target volume PTV) and organs at risk (OAR) related DVH parameters were compared between the dose distributions before and after plan adaption.  Results:   All subgroups clearly benefited from online plan adaption in terms of improved PTV coverage. For the liver, lung and abdominal lymph nodes cases, a consistent improvement in GTV coverage was found, while many fractions of the prostate subgroup showed acceptable CTV coverage even before plan adaption. The largest median improvements in GTV near-minimum dose (D98%) were found for the liver (6.3%, p < 0.001), lung (3.9%, p < 0.001), and abdominal lymph nodes (6.8%, p < 0.001) subgroups. Regarding OAR sparing, the largest median OAR dose reduction during plan adaption was found for the pancreas subgroup (-87.0%). However, in the pancreas subgroup an optimal GTV coverage was not always achieved because sparing of OARs was prioritized.  Conclusion:   With online plan adaptation, it was possible to achieve significant improvements in target volume coverage and OAR sparing for various tumor entities and account for interfractional anatomical changes.""","""['Lukas Nierer', 'Chukwuka Eze', 'Vanessa da Silva Mendes', 'Juliane Braun', 'Patrick Thum', 'Rieke von Bestenbostel', 'Christopher Kurz', 'Guillaume Landry', 'Michael Reiner', 'Maximilian Niyazi', 'Claus Belka', 'Stefanie Corradini']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Benefit of replanning in MR-guided online adaptive radiation therapy in the treatment of liver metastasis.', 'Dosimetric comparison of MR-linac-based IMRT and conventional VMAT treatment plans for prostate cancer.', 'Role of Daily Plan Adaptation in MR-Guided Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy for Adrenal Metastases.', 'Primary treatment of prostate cancer using 1.5\xa0T MR-linear accelerator.', 'Online adaptive magnetic resonance guided radiotherapy for pancreatic cancer: state of the art, pearls and pitfalls.', 'Fan beam CT-guided online adaptive external radiotherapy of uterine cervical cancer: a dosimetric evaluation.', 'Effect of 0.35\xa0T and 1.5\xa0T magnetic fields on superficial dose in MR-guided radiotherapy of laryngeal cancer.', 'Ventilation and perfusion MRI at a 0.35 T MR-Linac: feasibility and reproducibility study.', 'Simultaneous treatment of two lung cancer lesions with stereotactic MR-guided adaptive radiation therapy: A case report.', 'Stereotactic MR-Guided Radiotherapy for Adrenal Gland Metastases: First Clinical Results.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed urinary tract infection patients with urolithiasis, presented to Xiangya Hospital from March 2014 to April 2021. Patients were divided into older and younger groups according to 60 years of age. The bacterial spectrum and drug sensitivity of uropathogens were compared.  Results:   A total of 542 strains of uropathogens (177 in older and 365 in younger groups) were isolated from 507 patients. E. coli (41.8% vs 43.6%) remains the most common pathogen, followed by E. faecalis (6.2% vs 9.6%) in older and younger groups, respectively. Particularly, K. pneumoniae was significantly more frequent in older (9.6%) than in younger group (4.7%, P < .05). E. faecium was substantially more prevalent in older group (6.2%) than in younger group (2.7%, P < .05). The proportion of males increased in older patients (47.3%) than in younger patients (34.9%, P = 0.007). In both groups, major Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) revealed a high sensitivity over 70% to piperacillin/tazobactam, imipenem and amikacin, whereas the resistance level was high to penicillin, tetracycline and vancomycin. Major Gram-positive (E. faecalis and E. faecium) isolates demonstrated high sensitivity of over 50% to gentamicin and vancomycin in both groups. Furthermore, uropathogens isolated from younger urolithiasis patients were more susceptible to antimicrobials than those isolated from older patients.  Conclusions:   The male increased in the older urolithiasis patients with UTI and uropathogens microbial spectrum in older urolithiasis patients are different from younger.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the participation of HIF-1α activation in the radiobiological response of the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP, describing the phenomena with a mathematical model. Four groups were formed under different exposure conditions, including hypoxic cells treated with CoCl2 (300 μM for 22 h) with or without hypoxia-inducible factor inhibitor (150 nM chetomin for 4 h added after an incubation period of 18 h with CoCl2, just before completing the incubation period of 22 h). They were exposed to a source of 60Co in a dose range between 2 and 10 Gy to obtain survival curves that are fitted to a mathematical model. CoCl2 or chetomin treatments do not affect the viability of LNCaP cells that remained unchanged after irradiation. CoCl2 induced hypoxia reduces the survivability of LNCaP, and obstruction of HIF-1α signaling with chetomine produces a slight radioprotective effect. As others report, the genetic reprogramming induced by HIF-1α activation acts as an intrinsic agent that selects cells with more aggressive behavior (Pressley et al., 2017), while chetomin protects cells from death due to its scavenger properties. Interestingly, treatment with chetomin of cells induced to hypoxia (HIF-1 activation with CoCl2) produces a significant reduction in the radioresistance of LNCaP cells, demonstrating that the simultaneous use of chetomin and gamma radiation is an effective option for the treatment of hypoxic prostate cancer. At the molecular level, we suggest that the selective force exerted by HIF-1α depends on the production of free radicals by radiation. The proposed mathematical model showed that the rate of change in cell survival as a function of radiation dose is proportional to the product of two functions, one that describes cell death and the other that describes natural or artificial resistance to radiation.""","""['Erika Patricia Azorín-Vega', 'Consuelo Letechípia de León', 'Mayra Guadalupe García-Reyna', 'Héctor René Vega-Carrillo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Appl Radiat Isot""","""['Inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha radiosensitized MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells in vitro.', 'Dual targeting of the androgen receptor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α pathways synergistically inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'HIF-1α inhibition by siRNA or chetomin in human malignant glioma cells: effects on hypoxic radioresistance and monitoring via CA9 expression.', 'Silibinin inhibits hypoxia-induced HIF-1α-mediated signaling, angiogenesis and lipogenesis in prostate cancer cells: In vitro evidence and in vivo functional imaging and metabolomics.', 'Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.']"""

Methods:   Prostate intrafraction 3D displacements were recorded with a transperineal ultrasound probe and were evaluated in 46 prostate cancer patients (876 fractions) treated by moderate hypofractionated radiation therapy (60 Gy in 20 fractions). For 18 patients (346 fractions), treatment plans were recomputed increasing CTV-to-PTV margins from 0 to 6 mm with an auto-planning optimization algorithm. Dose distribution was estimated using the voxel shifting method by displacing CTV structure according to the retrieved movements. Time-dependent margins were finally calculated using both van Herk's formula and the voxel shifting method.  Results:   Mean intrafraction prostate displacements observed were -0.02 ± 0.52 mm, 0.27 ± 0.78 mm and -0.43 ± 1.06 mm in left-right, supero-inferior and antero-posterior directions, respectively. The CTV dosimetric coverage increased with increased CTV-to-PTV margins but it decreased with time. Hence using van Herk's formula, after 7 min of treatment, a margin of 0.4 and 0.5 mm was needed in left and right, 1.5 and 0.7 mm in inferior and superior and 1.1 and 3.2 mm in anterior and posterior directions, respectively. Conversely, using the voxel shifting method, a margin of 0 mm was needed in left-right, 2 mm in superior, 3 mm in inferior and anterior and 5 mm in posterior directions, respectively. With this latter NI-AS margin strategy, the dosimetric target coverage was equivalent to the one obtained with a 5 mm homogeneous margin.

Despite great efforts, the detailed mechanisms underlying castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) remain unclear. Sirtuin 5 (SIRT5), an NAD+-dependent desuccinylase, is hypothesized to be a key regulator of various cancers. However, compared to other SIRTs, the role of SIRT5 in cancer has not been extensively studied. Here, we revealed significantly decreased SIRT5 levels in aggressive PCa cells relative to the PCa stages. The correlation between the decrease in the SIRT5 level and the patient's reduced survival rate was also confirmed. Using quantitative global succinylome analysis, we characterized a significant increase in the succinylation at lysine 118 (K118su) of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which plays a role in increasing LDH activity. As a substrate of SIRT5, LDHA-K118su significantly increased the migration and invasion of PCa cells and LDH activity in PCa patients.

Disparities in survival and long-term side effects encourage the establishment of networks to increase access to complex organ-conservative strategies, such as brachytherapy. We report our experience of an international cooperation model in childhood cancers.  Methods and materials:   We examined the outcome of all children referred to our center from national or international networks to be treated according to a multimodal organ-conservative approach, including brachytherapy.  Results:   We identified 305 patients whose median age at diagnosis was 2.2 years (range, 1.4 months to 17.2 years). Among these patients, 99 (32.4%) were treated between 2015 and 2020; 172 (56.4%) were referred from national centers; and 133 (43.6%) were international patients from 31 countries (mainly Europe). Also, 263 patients were referred for primary treatment and 42 patients were referred for salvage treatment. Genitourinary tumors were the most frequent sites, with 56.4% bladder/prostate rhabdomyosarcoma and 28.5% gynecologic tumors. In addition to brachytherapy, local treatment consisted of partial tumor resection in 207 patients (67.9%), and 39 patients (13%) had additional external radiation therapy. Median follow-up was 58 months (range, 1 month to 48 years), 93 months for national patients, and 37 months for international patients (P < .0001). Five-year local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates were 90.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 87.3%-94.4%), 84.4% (95% CI, 80.1%-89.0%), and 93.3% (95% CI, 90.1%-96.5%), respectively. Patients referred for salvage treatment had poorer disease-free survival (P < .01). Implementation of image guided pulse-dose-rate brachytherapy was associated with better local control among patients with rhabdomyosarcoma referred for primary treatment (hazard ratio, 9.72; 95% CI, 1.24-71.0). At last follow-up, 16.7% patients had long-term severe treatment-related complications, and 2 patients (0.7%) had developed second malignancy.  Conclusions:   This retrospective series shows the feasibility of a multinational referral network for brachytherapy allowing high patient numbers in rare pediatric cancers. High local control probability and acceptable late severe complication probability could be achieved despite very challenging situations. This cooperation model could serve as a basis for generating international reference networks for high-tech radiation such as brachytherapy to increase treatment care opportunities and cure probability.""","""['Cyrus Chargari', 'Christine Haie-Meder', 'Sophie Espenel', 'Max-Adrien Garcia', 'Myriam Ben-Arush', 'Stéphanie Bolle', 'Anna Borjesson', 'Maja Cesen', 'Rita Costa Lago', 'Anne-Sophie Defachelles', 'Barbara De Moerloose', 'Christine Devalck', 'Pernille Edslev', 'Nuno Jorge Farinha', 'Nadine Francotte', 'Heidi Glosli', 'Sebastien Gouy', 'Gabriela Guillen Burrieza', 'Sylvie Helfre', 'Sabine Irtan', 'Antonis Kattamis', 'Ana Lacerda', 'Antonin Levy', 'Lisa Lyngsie Hjalgrim', 'Ludovic Mansuy', 'Eric Mascard', 'Salma Moalla', 'Daniel Orbach', 'Cormac Owens', 'Pascale Philippe-Chomette', 'Barry Pizer', 'Claire Pluchart', 'Marleen Renard', 'Anne Gro Wesenberg Rognlien', 'Angélique Rome', 'Sabine Sarnacki', 'Akmal Safwat', 'Amalia Schiavetti', 'Jill Serre', 'Cécile Verite', 'Nicolas Von Der Weid', 'Mariusz Wysocki', 'Dominique Valteay-Couanet', 'Eric Deutsch', 'Véronique Minard-Colin', 'Hélène Martelli', 'Florent Guérin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Brachytherapy Combined With Surgery for Conservative Treatment of Children With Bladder Neck and/or Prostate Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Pulsed-dose rate brachytherapy for pediatric bladder prostate rhabdomyosarcoma: Compliance and early clinical results.', 'Brachytherapy in the treatment of vesicoprostatic rhabdomyosarcomas in children.', 'Salvage low-dose-rate brachytherapy for local recurrences after prostatectomy and adjuvant or salvage external beam irradiation: Feasibility study on five patients and literature review.', 'Brachytherapy in paediatric sarcoma.', 'Developments in the Surgical Approach to Staging and Resection of Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Implementation of Image-Guided Brachytherapy for Pediatric Vaginal Cancers: Feasibility and Early Clinical Results.', 'Providing Patients with Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Access to Brachytherapy: Experience from a Referral Network for Women Treated in Overseas France.', 'A Web-Based Prognostic Model for Pediatric Genitourinary Rhabdomyosarcoma: Analysis of Population-Based Cohort With External Validation.']"""

Here, we extended the finding of elevated RNF6 expression levels and its association with poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Genome-wide RNA sequencing in H3255 cells with RNF6 knockdown, followed by analysis of differentially expressed genes using Clusters of Orthologous Groups and gene set enrichment analysis revealed aberrations in genes related to DNA repair, especially double-strand break (DSB) repair. RNF6 knockdown increased γH2AX foci, a biomarker for DSBs in H3255 and A549 LUAD cells, and enhanced DNA damage induced by chemotherapy in cisplatin-resistant A549/CDDP cells. In a series of experiments in cultured cells, as well as in nude mice carrying xenografts, RNF6 knockdown restored the sensitivity of A549/CDDP cells to cisplatin treatment. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing in RNF6-knockdown cells revealed the significant downregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an oncogene that promotes DNA repair. Re-chromatin immunoprecipitation assay results suggested the formation of a RNF6-TCF4 complex that binds to the PCNA promoter to activate its transcription. Downregulation of RNF6 reduced TCF4 recruitment to PCNA promoters in H3255 and A549 cells, indicating that RNF6 regulates PCNA transcription to a certain extent by regulating TCF4 binding to PCNA promoters. The collective results implicate RNF6 overexpression as a molecular target in the management of cisplatin-resistant LUAD.""","""['Yile Sun', 'Hongmiao Sun', 'Yuwen Qi', 'Mengqiao Pan', 'Na An', 'Xuejiao Leng', 'Yun Liu', 'Zhiwei Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Elevated Glutathione Peroxidase 2 Expression Promotes Cisplatin Resistance in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Circular RNA CDR1-AS contributes to pemetrexed and cisplatin chemoresistance through EGFR/PI3K signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'ADH1C Facilitates Cisplatin Resistance of Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells.', 'Gene commander in the trash heap: Transcriptional regulation and ubiquitination modification mediated by RNF6 in carcinogenesis.', 'RNF6 as an Oncogene and Potential Therapeutic Target-A Review.', 'TRIM26 promotes non-small cell lung cancer survival by inducing PBX1 degradation.', 'Downregulation of Linc00173 increases BCL2 mRNA stability via the miR-1275/PROCA1/ZFP36L2 axis and induces acquired cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

We report the final analysis of this trial following two additional treatment arms in which patients with mCRPC continued concurrent treatment until progression.  Materials and methods:   Patients with mCRPC were treated with MVI-816 and pembrolizumab every 3 weeks (arm 3, n=20) or MVI-816 every 2 weeks and pembrolizumab every 4 weeks (arm 4, n=20). The primary objectives were safety, 6-month progression-free survival (PFS), median time to radiographic progression, and objective response rates. Secondary objectives included immunological evaluations.  Results:   In 25 patients with measurable disease, there were no complete response and one confirmed partial response in a patient who subsequently found to have an MSIhi tumor. 4/40 patients (10%) had a prostate-specific antigen decline >50%. The estimated overall radiographic PFS rate at 6 months was 47.2% (44.4% arm 3, 61.5% arm 4). Accounting for all off-study events, overall median time on treatment was 5.6 months (95% CI: 5.4 to 10.8 months), 5.6 months for arm 3 and 8.1 months for arm 4 (p=0.64). Thirty-two per cent of patients remained on trial beyond 6 months without progression. Median overall survival was 22.9 (95% CI: 16.2 to 25.6) months. One grade 4 event (hyperglycemia) was observed. Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) >grade 1 were observed in 42% of patients overall. Interferon-γ and/or granzyme B immune response to prostatic acid phosphatase was detected in 2/20 patients in arm 3 and 6/20 patients in arm 4. Plasma cytokines associated with immune activation and CD8+ T-cell recruitment were augmented at weeks 6 and 12. The development of irAE was significantly associated with a prolonged time on treatment (HR=0.42, p=0.003). Baseline DNA homologous recombination repair mutations were not associated with longer time to progression.  Conclusions:   Findings here demonstrate that combining programmed cell death 1 blockade with MVI-816 is safe, can augment tumor-specific T cells, and can result in a favorable 6-month disease control rate. Correlative studies suggest T-cell activation by vaccination is critical to the mechanism of action of this combination. Future randomized clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.

Introduction:   Prostate cancer (PCa) is a heterogeneous disease with many prostate adenocarcinomas being indolent and a low probability of ever causing symptoms or death. Active surveillance (AS) is a form of conservative management aimed to reduce over-treatment for low-risk PCa patients. Over the years, experience with AS has grown considerably and is now standard in some countries, however a universal protocol still does not exist.  Methods:   Nationwide anonymous e-survey concerning habits and practices on AS among Portuguese urologists, that consisted of twelve questions and was sent electronically to all 368 current members of the Portuguese Urological Association.  Results:   56 urologists were surveyed (15.21% answer rate), evenly distributed geographically and allocated according to years of experience as well as number of PCa patients managed monthly. The vast majority of respondents recommends AS to their patients, particularly ISUP grade 1 patients, whose PSA serum level is bellow 20 ng/mL. Observance of AS programs by patients was not in question but concerns exist over psychological morbidity while harboring disease. Majority believed that international guidelines surveillance protocols were adequate and sufficient, but there are some constraints concerning availability of periodic MRIs and re-biopsy needs.  Conclusions:   AS seems to be sustained in urologist clinical practice, although patients still lag to adhere and choose for active treatment. AS may not be an easy choice for patients and clinicians due to uncertainty of disease progression, risk of loss to follow-up and repeated biopsies but is also a cause for anxiety, depression, uncertainty and a perception of danger.""","""['S R Silva Gaspar', 'M Fernandes', 'A Castro', 'T Oliveira', 'J Santos Dias', 'J Palma Dos Reis']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Systematic Review of Active Surveillance for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer to Develop Recommendations Regarding Inclusion of Intermediate-risk Disease, Biopsy Characteristics at Inclusion and Monitoring, and Surveillance Repeat Biopsy Strategy.', 'Selecting men diagnosed with prostate cancer for active surveillance using a risk calculator: a prospective impact study.', 'Knowledge, attitudes, and practices of active surveillance in prostate cancer among urologists: a real-life survey from Brazil.', 'A Narrative Overview of Active Surveillance for Clinically Localised Prostate Cancer.', 'Update and optimization of active surveillance in prostate cancer in 2021.', 'Anxiety and Depression in Patients with Prostate Cancer, at Cancer Diagnosis and after a One-Year Follow-Up.']"""

Gold fiducial markers and a PR-HS was inserted in 22 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed localized prostate cancer. For planning comparison, dosimetry from the clinical plans was compared against replans based on a simulated rectum volume designed to recreate a clinically appropriate spacer-less anatomy for each patient. Both sets were planned to 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions using the treatment planning system associated with the CyberKnife VSI system. The aim was to ensure equivalent target coverage for both plans and to evaluate doses to the organs-at-risk (OARs): rectum, bladder and penile bulb. The median PR-HS implant volume was 11.2 cc (range 8.8 to 14.9 cc). The maximal median perirectal separation was 15.5 mm (10.5 to 20.7 mm). Statistically significant reductions were noted for the 3 OARs, with no statistically significant difference in planning target volumes or clinical target volume coverage. All rectal dose constraints were significantly improved in the PR-HS plans with a percentage dose difference of at least 24% (rectum V18.1Gy (%)) to 60.5% (rectum V36Gy (cc)). The bladder and penile bulb dose constraints parameters were also significantly improved: the bladder V37Gy was reduced by 17.1%, V18.1Gy was reduced by 4.2%; the penile bulb D50% was reduced by 7.7%.

However, novel hormonal agents (NHAs) and chemotherapy are now approved for male patients with mHSPC. This study aimed to understand the impact NHA approvals had on mHSPC real-world treatment patterns and to identify the key factors associated with NHA or chemotherapy (± ADT) usage vs ADT alone.  Methods:   Data were collected from the Adelphi Prostate Cancer Disease Specific Programme (DSP)™, a point-in-time survey of physicians and their consulting patients conducted in the United States (US), five European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom), and Japan between January and August 2020. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics for individual countries, regions, and all countries combined. Pairwise analyses were used to further investigate differences between treatment groups at global level.  Results:   336 physicians provided data on 1195 mHSPC patients. Globally, at data collection, the most common mHSPC regimen initiated first was ADT alone (47%), followed by NHAs (± ADT) (31%, of which 21% was abiraterone, 8% was enzalutamide, and 2% was apalutamide) and chemotherapy (± ADT) (19%). The highest rates of ADT alone usage were observed in Japan (78%) and Italy (66%), and the lowest in Spain (34%) and in the US (36%). Our results showed that clinical decision making was driven by patient fitness, compliance, tolerance of adverse events, and balance of impact on quality of life vs overall survival.  Conclusions:   This real-world survey offered early insights into the evolving mHSPC treatment paradigm. It showed that in 2020, ADT alone remained the most common initial mHSPC therapy, suggesting that physicians may prefer using treatments which they are familiar and have experience with, despite clinical trial evidence of improved survival with NHAs or chemotherapy (± ADT) vs ADT alone. Results also indicated that physicians prescribed specific mHSPC treatments primarily based on the following criteria: patient preference, disease burden/severity, and the performance status and comorbidities of the patient. To fully appreciate the rapidly changing mHSPC treatment landscape and monitor NHA uptake, additional real-world studies are required.""","""['Andrea Leith', 'Amanda Ribbands', 'Jeri Kim', 'Emily Clayton', 'Liane Gillespie-Akar', 'Lingfeng Yang', 'Sameer R Ghate']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Real-World Treatment Patterns in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Across Europe (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom) and Japan.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy plus chemotherapy\u202f±\u2009androgen receptor-targeting agents for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Management of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC): an Evolving Treatment Paradigm.', 'Adding abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A\xa0systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'ARCHES: A Randomized, Phase III Study of Androgen Deprivation Therapy With Enzalutamide or Placebo in Men With Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Trends in the Use of Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Axis Inhibitors for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Clinical Factors Predicting Biological Recurrence.']"""

RT-qPCR was used to test the expression of SNHG11 in prostate cancer and BPH tissues, as well as in cell lines. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression assays were introduced to evaluate the prognostic meaning of SNHG11 in prostate cancer. The CCK-8 assays were performed to explore the effect of SNHG11 on prostate cancer cell proliferation, and a Transwell assay was conducted to access the influence of SNHG11 on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. SNHG11 expression level was upregulated both in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of SNHG11 was significantly associated with Gleason score, clinical T stage, surgical margin status, and lymph node metastasis. Patients with high SNHG11 expression levels led to a shorter overall survival time and biochemical recurrence-free survival when compared with those of low expression levels. Multivariate Cox regression results suggested that SNHG11 has the potential to act as a prognostic marker for prostate cancer patients. Knockdown of SNHG11 suppressed 22RV1 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.

This mechanism does not require activation of caspase or the participation of other apoptotic effector molecules (such as BAX or BAK), nor is it accompanied by the morphological characteristics or biochemical processes of apoptosis. The STEAP3 gene was found because it promotes tumor apoptosis in prostate cancer, but its role in renal cell carcinoma has not been studied in depth. Through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found that the expression of the STEAP3 gene was upregulated in renal cell carcinoma tissue samples and cell lines, and it was found to be highly expressed in renal cell carcinoma tissue through immunohistochemistry. This upregulation is related to poor survival and prognosis of patients. We used erastin, a ferroptosis inducer, found that renal cell carcinoma became more susceptible to ferroptosis after knocking down STEAP3. The results indicate that renal cell carcinoma cell lines with knocked down STEAP3 expression are more sensitive to ferroptosis, and this effect occurs through the p53/xCT pathway.

The mechanistic studies of 4 in A549 cells indicated that the complex induced apoptotic cell death as evidenced via caspase 3/7 activity, Bcl2 inactivation, annexin V and DAPI/PI staining. 4 further elevated the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), depolarized mitochondria and enhanced the expression of γ-H2AX, thus contributing to its remarkable anticancer activity.""","""['Ceyda Icsel', 'Veysel T Yilmaz', 'Muhittin Aygun', 'Merve Erkisa', 'Engin Ulukaya']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Dalton Trans""","""['Water-soluble copper(II) 5-fluorouracil complexes bearing polypyridyl co-ligands: synthesis, structures and anticancer activity.', 'Zn(ii), Cd(ii) and Hg(ii) saccharinate complexes with 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine as promising anticancer agents in breast and lung cancer cell lines via ROS-induced apoptosis.', ""Ni(ii)/Cu(ii)/Zn(ii) 5,5-diethylbarbiturate complexes with 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2'-dipyridylamine: synthesis, structures, DNA/BSA binding, nuclease activity, molecular docking, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity and the mode of cell death."", 'New manganese(II), iron(II), cobalt(II), nickel(II) and copper(II) saccharinate complexes of 2,6-bis(2-benzimidazolyl)pyridine as potential anticancer agents.', 'Synthesis, characterization, interaction with DNA and cytotoxicity in vitro of novel pyridine complexes with Zn(II).']"""

Aim:   To determine the surgical potential of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) and the rate of postoperative complications during the learning curve.  Materials and methods:   A total of 98 patients undergoing HoLEP in the surgical department of the Clinical Hospital ""Mother & Child"" during the period from January 2018 to May 2020 were included in the study. HoLEP was performed by a single surgeon with previous experience in transurethral procedures. The criteria for inclusion in the study group were as follows: moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms, prostate volume > 40 cm3, maximum flow <15 ml/sec, the volume of residual urine > 50 ml. The exclusion criteria were the following: inflammatory process in the lower urinary tract, genitourinary malignancy, previous urinary tract interventions. The evaluated criteria included age, prostate size, International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS and QoL), bladder diary, PSA, uroflowmetry, total operative time, length of catheterization, complications according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification, and length of stay.  Results:   During pathologic study, two cases of incidental prostate cancer (2.1%) were detected. The relationships between the prostate size and operative time (p<0.05), operative time and length of stay (p<0.05) were found. The total rate of complications was 16.3%. There were no complications more or equal IIIb according to the Clavien-Dindo Classification. The most dangerous complications were injuries of the bladder wall and ureteral orifice (31.25% and 18.75% among all complications, respectively).  Discussion:   It should be considered that a large ""middle lobe"" is associated with a high risk of injury of the ureteral orifices. In our series, there were 5 cases of bladder tamponade, while bladder injuries during the morcellation developed in the first 10 patients.  Conclusion:   HoLEP is a reasonable alternative to TURP for surgical treatment of BPH and is considered a safe procedure for patients taking anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs. Past experience of TURP allows to learn the technique faster and to reduce the number of complications.""","""['M M Kutluev', 'R I Safiullin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Feasibility of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for recurrent/residual benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).', 'Transurethral resection of the prostate versus transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia with bladder detrusor overactivity.', 'Holmium laser en-bloc enucleation of the prostate: Bi-centric prospective evaluation of 109 consecutive cases.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate versus transurethral resection of the prostate: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.']"""

OBJECTIVE: to analyze the role of the components of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of proliferative lesions of the prostate glan MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 63 patients who underwent transrectal prostate biopsy. The first group consisted of 19 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, the second group consisted of 19 men whose prostate cancer was detected during repeated biopsy, the third group consisted of 25 men with prostate cancer detected during primary prostate biopsy. The expression of angiotensin II type II (AT2-R) receptors in prostate tissue was evaluated using primary polyclonal antibodies Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor and the EnVision FLEX imaging system (Dako, Denmark) according to a standard technique. The activity of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) was determined in the secret of the prostate gland, RESULTS: It was found that the activity of ACE in the secret of the prostate gland in proliferative diseases is significantly higher than in the ""healthy"" prostate. The highest activity of ACE was noted for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and the minimum - for prostate cancer. The expression of AT2-R in prostate tissues in proliferative diseases of the prostate gland has its own characteristics. The expression of AT2-R in the prostate stroma turned out to be the same, in the nuclei of epithelial cells, the level of expression of AT2-R decreased in the range of BPH-PIN-CP. Thus, an increase in the activity of ACE, the accumulation of angiotensin II in prostate secretions in proliferative prostate diseases against the background of a deficiency of AT2-R is the metabolic basis of malignant transformation of the prostate gland.

However, there is insufficient data about the diagnostic performance and cost of fpMRI.  Purpose:   To compare the diagnostic performances and cost analysis of fpMRI and mpMRI in clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCA).  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 103 patients (63 had csPCA) with a mean age of 66.83 (± 7.22) years were included.  Field strength/sequence:   A 1.5-T; T1- and T2-weighted turbo spin-echo imaging (T1WI and T2WI), echo-planar diffusion-weighted images, and dynamic contrast-enhanced T1W imaging.  Assessment:   Three readers independently evaluated the fpMRI and mpMRI images in different sessions blinded to all patient information. Diagnostic performances of fpMRI and mpMRI were evaluated. Kappa coefficient (κ) was used to determine the interreader and intrareader agreement. A detailed cost analysis was performed for each protocol.  Statistical tests:   Receiver operating characteristics analysis, area under the curve (AUC), and κ test were used. Diagnostic performance parameters were also calculated.  Results:   Of the 63 malignant index lesions (csPCA), 53/63 of those (84.1%) originated from the peripheral zone and 10/63 lesions (15.9%) originated from the transition zone. The AUC values for fpMRI were 0.878 for reader 1, 0.937 for reader 2, and 0.855 for reader 3. For mpMRI, the AUC values were 0.893 for reader 1, 0.94 for reader 2, and 0.862 for reader 3. Inter and intrareader agreements were moderate to substantial (κ range, 0.5-0.79). The total cost per examination was calculated as €12.39 and €30.10 for fpMRI and mpMRI, respectively.  Data conclusions:   Fast MRI protocol has similar diagnostic performance with mpMRI in detecting csPCA, and fpMRI can be considered an alternative protocol that could create a lower financial burden on health-care systems.

Traditionally however, it is performed under general anaesthesia, thus it carries a differing set of risks. Recently, new studies have performed TPB under local anaesthesia with success. In the present study, we explored our experience of performing TPB under local anaesthesia in an Australian cohort.  Methods:   In this prospective study based at a metropolitan outpatient clinic, patients were provided with TPB under local anaesthesia. We assessed prostate cancer detection rates, complication rates and patient tolerability. Pain tolerability was assess using patient reported pain score on the visual analogue scale. Follow up data was collected at days 7 and 30 post-biopsy via telephone interview.  Results:   A total of 48 patients were enrolled in this study between June 2020 and March 2021. Median age was 65.5 years and median PSA was 6.95 ng/mL. Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 58% of patients. During the procedure, pain scores were rated the highest during infiltration of local anaesthetic agent with a median score of 5. By the conclusion of the procedure, median pain score was 1. Vast majority of patients (85.4%) would opt for a repeat TPB under local anaesthesia should the need for prostate biopsy arise again.

Our objective was to determine whether supervised exercise prior to and during initial therapy could mitigate adverse effects of ADT plus enzalutamide.  Methods:   We conducted a single center trial in patients with recurrent prostate cancer treated with ADT and enzalutamide. We randomized 26 patients to 16 weeks of supervised exercise (aerobic and resistance), starting 4 weeks before initiation of ADT and enzalutamide, or usual care. The primary endpoint was change in peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) as a measure of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF). Secondary endpoints were functional capacity, maximal strength, body composition, patient-reported outcomes, safety, and feasibility. Analysis of covariance was used to compare outcomes for groups at Week 17 adjusted for baseline values.  Results:   The usual care group (N = 13) showed declines from baseline to week 17 in both absolute CRF (-0.31 L/min, -10.9%; p < 0.01) and relative CRF (-3.2 mL/kg/min, -8.9%; p = 0.04); worse fatigue (p = 0.01); and worse quality of life (p = 0.01).

Detection rates were correlated with patients' prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, primary Gleason score, and prior use of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Results: Ninety-seven patients were included (65 at Technical University Munich and 32 at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich). The median prescan PSA was 4.19 ng/mL (range, 0.1-159 ng/mL). The primary Gleason score was ≤6 in 19 patients, 7 in 25, ≥8 in 33, and unknown in 20. Thirty patients received ADT in the 6 mo preceding PET/CT. 18F-rhPSMA-7 identified lesions in 91 of 97 (94%) patients. Detection rates stratified by PSA were 88% (22/25), 97% (30/31), 90% (19/21), and 100% (20/20) for a PSA of <2, 2-<5, 5-<10, and ≥10 ng/mL, respectively. Detection rates in the subgroup of patients not meeting the Phoenix criteria for BCR were 80% (4/5), 90% (9/10), 100% (4/4), and 83% (5/6) for a PSA of <0.5, 0.5-<1, 1-<1.5, and 1.5-2 ng/mL, respectively. There were no significant differences in detection rates between patients with and without prior ADT (100% vs. 91%, P = 0.173) or patients with a Gleason score of ≤7 and a Gleason score of ≥8 (98% vs. 91%, P = 0.316).18F-rhPSMA-7 revealed local recurrence in 80% (78/97); pelvic lymph node metastases in 38% (37/97); retroperitoneal and supradiaphragmatic lymph node metastases in 9% (9/97) and 4% (4/97), respectively; bone metastases in 27% (26/97); and visceral metastases in 3% (3/97).

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a predictive indicator of prostate pathology. Men with elevated PSA levels are at increased risk of developing PC. There is currently no UK national PC screening programme, therefore patients often present to general practices (GPs) at later stages of pathology, worsening patient prognosis and outcomes.  Local problem:   The location of the GP surgery had a large patient population at increased risk of PC, namely Afro-Caribbean/Asian males.  Methods:   We conducted baseline measurements to identify male patients over the age of 65 and/or male patients who were at high risk of developing PC. These included previous referred patients or patients with a PSA over 10.0. We then implemented three plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles and measured their effect after 2 weeks of starting the respective intervention.  Interventions:   PDSA1: Generating a list of target patients who have not had repeat/follow-up/referral and directly contacting by telephone to invite them for a blood test.PDSA2: Creating patient-specific electronic pop-up reminders on the electronic-patient-record system for PSA follow-up/referral/repeat test.Planned PDSA3: Patient education of prostate health and general self-checking, as well as benefits/risks of undergoing PSA screening in the form of patient focus groups and informative leaflets.  Results:   We identified 220 male patients over 65 registered at a large South London GP surgery. 77.7% of eligible patients had a PSA measurement since 1 April 2019. Our results showed an overall increase in screening of 13.5% from baseline.  Conclusions:   Our project identified patients that may potentially have undiagnosed prostate pathology. However, a key factor for not reaching our goal was blood test refusal. This was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the capacity to disseminate appropriate information to the local population on the importance of PSA screening.""","""['Neil Limaye', 'Daniele Zorzato', 'Aaruran Nadarajasundaram', 'Sabrina B Y Ong']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMJ Open Qual""","""['GPs views and understanding of PSA testing, screening and early detection; survey.', 'Prostate-specific antigen testing rates and referral patterns from general practice data in England.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA)-Based Population Screening for Prostate Cancer: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing of men in UK general practice: a 10-year longitudinal cohort study.', 'Baseline prostate-specific antigen testing at a young age.']"""

Nowadays there is no standardized method for urinary continence measurement. Posterior rhabdosphincter reconstruction (PRR) is a surgical step that can improve early urinary continence after RP. Our objective was to analyse different continence definitions and predictors of urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted RP (RARP).  Material and methods:   We conducted a double-blind, randomised controlled trial (NCT03302169) including 152 consecutive patients with localized prostate cancer subjected to RARP. Patients were randomised to single urethrovesical anastomosis (control arm) or PRR before urethrovesical anastomosis (PRR arm). Urinary continence was measured with the EPIC-26 and ICIQ-SF validated questionnaires, and pad use (0-1 pads and no pads), at 7, 15, 30, 90, 180 and 365 days after catheter removal. Prognostic factors for early urinary continence recovery were analysed.  Results:   72 patients were included in the control arm and 80 in the PRR arm. Baseline characteristics were similar between arms, except body mass index, which was higher in PRR arm. ""No pad"" was the only definition assessing the benefit of PRR at 30 days, 33.8% in PRR arm and 18.1% in control arm, p = 0.022; and at 90 days, 58.8 and 43.1% respectively, p = 0.038. Questionnaires did not detect differences in terms of continence recovery. PRR was the only predictor for early continence recovery, p = 0.03.

Glycerol alone was therefore one of the controls. Tumors of human PC3 castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells were initiated in male nude mice and grown for 12 days. Mice were then sorted such that mean tumor weights were the same in each group, and osmotic minipumps delivering 0.25 µL/h of either saline or glycerol were then implanted subcutaneously.  Results:   Contrary to our initial assumption that glycerol would be without effect, tumors grew more rapidly in the glycerol group such that tumors were twice the size of those in the saline group after 4 weeks. Given the dose delivered, analysis of the literature suggests this effect was not via the conversion of glycerol to glucose but possibly via a reduction in oxidative damage in the growing tumor. Our data demonstrate that amounts of glycerol that could reasonably be derived from the diet promote the growth of these tumors. Given the increasing use of glycerol in foods and beverages, we present these data to stimulate interest in an epidemiological study in the human population examining glycerol consumption and the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.""","""['Ariel DeGuzman', 'Mary Y Lorenson', 'Ameae M Walker']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Res Notes""","""['Coffee inhibits nuclear factor-kappa B in prostate cancer cells and xenografts.', 'Effects of direct injection of dehydrated ethanol on PC3 human prostate cancer cells in nude mice: preliminary study.', 'A molecular mimic of phosphorylated prolactin markedly reduced tumor incidence and size when DU145 human prostate cancer cells were grown in nude mice.', 'SNAI1 is critical for the aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells with low E-cadherin.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.', 'Differential Metabolism of Glycerol Based on Oral versus Intravenous Administration in Humans.']"""

Traditional approaches for methylation analysis have relied on bisulfite conversion of DNA, which can damage DNA and is not suitable for targeted gene analysis in low-input samples. Here, we have adapted methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2)-based DNA enrichment for use on a semi-automated exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP) platform for robust and scalable enrichment of methylated DNA from low-input samples, called SEEMLIS.  Results:   We show that combining methylation-sensitive enzyme digestion with ESP-based MBD2 enrichment allows for single gene analysis with high sensitivity for GSTP1 in highly impure, heterogenous samples. We also show that ESP-based MBD2 enrichment coupled with targeted pre-amplification allows for analysis of multiple genes with sensitivities approaching the single cell level in pure samples for GSTP1 and RASSF1 and sensitivity down to 14 cells for these genes in highly impure samples. Finally, we demonstrate the potential clinical utility of SEEMLIS by successful detection of methylated gene signatures in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from patients with prostate cancer with varying CTC number and sample purity.  Conclusions:   SEEMLIS is a robust assay for targeted DNA methylation analysis in low-input samples, with flexibility at multiple steps. We demonstrate the feasibility of this assay to analyze DNA methylation in prostate cancer cells using CTCs from patients with prostate cancer as a real-world example of a low-input analyte of clinical importance.

If managed inappropriately, severe hyponatremia can cause seizures, cerebral edema, and even death. There are various known causes of this inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone, including malignancy, CNS disorders, and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-renal axis. However, reports of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone after brachytherapy for prostate cancer are exceedingly rare.  Case presentation:   We report a case of symptomatic hyponatremia secondary to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone after prostate high-dose rate brachytherapy under general anesthesia in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  Conclusions:   In rare instances, inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone can occur after high-dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer.

Cohorts with different types of prostate biopsies were compiled within these hospitals. Primary outcome measure was any registered infectious complication within 7 days post-biopsy.

This study presents detailed tumour-based cancer prevalence estimates in Canada by sex, age group, cancer type and prevalence duration as of January 1, 2018.  Data and methods:   Estimates of two- and five-year cancer prevalence were calculated for an extensive list of cancers in the Canadian population (excluding Quebec) based on incidence data from the Canadian Cancer Registry linked to mortality data from the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database, and death-related information from tax data.  Results:   The two- and five-year cancer prevalence counts were 236,785 (832.1 per 100,000 people) and 503,060 (1,767.8 per 100,000 people), respectively. Cancer prevalence estimates varied by cancer site, and the four most prevalent cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung) accounted for 49.6% of total five-year cancer prevalence in Canada. Prevalence for all cancers combined increased dramatically with age: 74.3% of prevalent cases among males and 61.9% among females were encountered among the population aged 60 and older. Prevalence was higher among females than males before age 60, and higher among males thereafter, peaking in the 80-to-89 age group for both sexes.  Interpretation:   Prevalence mirrors the effects of both cancer incidence and survival. Breaking down cancer prevalence by disease duration is useful to distinguish groups of patients in different phases of care.

Five cohorts containing 1,046 PCa patients with RNA expression profiles and recorded clinical follow-up information were included. Univariate, multivariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression were used to select prognostic genes and establish the signature. Immunohistochemistry staining, cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays were used to assess the biological functions of key genes. Thirty-nine intersecting consensus prognostic genes from five independent cohorts were identified. Subsequently, an eleven-consensus-gene classifier was established. In addition, multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the classifier served as an independent indicator of recurrence-free survival in three of the five cohorts.

Therapy of prostate cancer is known to impact cognitive function. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of multiple classes of androgen-targeting therapeutics (ATT) on the risk of NDD.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study of men aged 45 and older with prostate within the US-based Mariner claims data set between January 1 and 27, 2021. A propensity score approach was used to minimize measured and unmeasured selection bias. Disease risk was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses.  Results:   Of the 1,798,648 men with prostate cancer, 209,722 met inclusion criteria. Mean (SD) follow-up was 6.4 (1.8) years. In the propensity score-matched population, exposure to ATT was associated with a minimal increase in NDD incidence (relative risk [RR], 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.10; p < 0.001). However, GnRH agonists alone were associated with significantly increased NDD risk (RR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.30-1.66; p <0.001). Abiraterone, commonly administered with GnRH agonists and low-dose prednisone, was associated with a significantly decreased risk (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.87; p < 0.001) of any NDD.  Conclusions:   Among patients with prostate cancer, GnRH agonist exposure was associated with an increased NDD risk. Abiraterone acetate reduced the risks of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease conferred by GnRH agonists, whereas the risk for ALS was reduced by androgen receptor inhibitors. Outcomes of these analyses contribute to addressing controversies in the field and indicate that GnRH agonism may be a predictable instigator of risk for NDD with opportunities for risk mitigation in combination with another ATT.""","""['Gregory L Branigan', 'Georgina Torrandell-Haro', 'Maira Soto', 'Edward P Gelmann', 'Francesca Vitali', 'Kathleen E Rodgers', 'Roberta Diaz Brinton']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Differential Impact of Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Antagonist Versus Agonist on Clinical Safety and Oncologic Outcomes on Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.', 'Androgen Deprivation Therapies and Changes in Comorbidity: A Comparison of Gonadotropin-releasing Hormone Agonists and Antiandrogen Monotherapy as Primary Therapy in Men with High-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Cardiovascular risk of androgen deprivation therapy for\xa0treatment of hormone-dependent prostate cancer : Differences\xa0between GnRH antagonists and GnRH agonists.', 'Update on cardiovascular and metabolic risk profiles of hormonal agents used in managing advanced prostate cancer.', 'Age and sex differences on anti-hyperglycemic medication exposure and risk of newly diagnosed multiple sclerosis in propensity score matched type 2 diabetics.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

APIP overexpression promoted tumor cell proliferation and migration and induced extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1/2 signaling reversed APIP-induced increase in cell proliferation and migration induced by APIP overexpression. Expression of APIP was hampered by miR-146a-3p. A dual luciferase reporter gene assay identified the regulatory relationship between APIP and miR-146a-3p in prostate cancer, suggesting that APIP is a direct target of miR-146a-3p. miR-146a-3p reduced cell proliferation and migration in prostate cancer. Furthermore, miR-146a-3p inhibited ERK1/2 activation. Application of an ERK1/2 inhibitor reversed the increase in cell proliferation and migration induced by miR-146a-3p inhibition.

However, this conclusion is still controversial. There is a close relationship between GSTs gene polymorphism and Mets. We suspect that the effect of GSTs gene polymorphism and Mets on PCa may be the result of their joint action. As a result, the purpose of this study was to investigate the potential effect of GSTs gene polymorphism on PCa in patients with Mets.  Methods:   We collected blood samples from 128 patients with PCa and 200 controls. The GSTs gene polymorphism was detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Age, characteristics of Mets, frequencies of GSTs gene polymorphism, total prostate volume (TPV), Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were recorded and analyzed.  Results:   There were significant differences in BMI, TG, LDL-C, FBG, SBP, DBP, and HDL-C among the control group, N-PCa group, and Mets-PCa group (p < 0.05). GSTT1 null genotype (OR = 2.844, 95% CI: 1.791-4.517), GSTM1 null genotype (OR = 2.192, 95% CI: 1.395-3.446), and GSTP1 (A/G + G/G) genotype (OR = 2.315, 95% CI: 1.465-3.657) were associated with PCa susceptibility and malignancy. Only the GSTT1 null genotype in Mets patients was positively correlated with PCa.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that GSTs gene polymorphism may be a risk factor for PCa and can predict the susceptibility and malignancy of PCa. Secondly, in Mets patients, GSTT1 null genotype significantly increased the risk of PCa.

Methods:   We conducted an open label single center phase 2 trial (NCT03179410) of men with progressive NEPC/AVPC either defined by histology or AVPC criteria. Avelumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks) was administered until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included ORR, radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival, and safety. Correlative studies included longitudinal peripheral blood immune phenotyping. The study was limited by the small number of patients enrolled and by the early termination due to COVID-19.  Results:   A total of 15 men with AVPC/NEPC were enrolled. The median age was 71 (range 51-85 years), and men had received a median of two prior therapies (range 1-3). Median PSA was 54 ng/dl (range 0-393), and 73% of men had liver metastasis.

Nevertheless, the side effects of these therapies are associated with an increased risk of accidental falls and fractures and a decreased quality of life. Preliminary evidence suggests that physical exercise can be a valid strategy to reduce the side effects of ADT and RT in men with prostate cancer. Despite this knowledge, most patients with prostate cancer are insufficiently active, and there is a lack of data on the safety and adherence to the recommended dose of physical exercise. This study protocol is designed to examine the feasibility and safety of a multicomponent experimental physical exercise intervention targeting psychophysical and cognitive functions and the quality of life in this population.  Methods and analysis:   This is a pilot feasibility study. Twenty-five men currently treated with ADT and RT for prostate cancer will be invited to participate in a 20-week, multicomponent physical exercise intervention, including supervised and unsupervised exercise sessions and meeting the current recommendation for exercise in cancer. The primary outcomes are physical exercise feasibility (recruitment, adherence and drop-out rates) and safety (adverse events related and unrelated to the intervention). The secondary outcomes are muscle strength, balance, fatigue, symptoms of anxiety and depression, cognitive function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. We will also record the number of accidental falls and fractures occurring during the intervention and at 1 year of follow-up.

CYP1B1, a critical enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of estradiol to 4-Hydroxy-17β-estradiol (4-OHE2), has been reported to promote the development and progression of hormone-related cancer, but its role in CRPC is unclear.  Methods:   To explore the underlying mechanism which CYP1B1 promotes the prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) characteristics, bioinformatics analyses of human clinical prostate cancer (PCa) datasets were performed. CYP1B1, IL6, and estrogen receptor-α (ERα) expression levels were evaluated in PCa and CRPC tissues via immunohistochemistry. The high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry assay was carried out to examine intracellular 4-OHE2 levels. Serum-free suspension culture and flow cytometry assays were performed to evaluate PCSCs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to validate that 4-OHE2 recruited ERα to the IL6 promoter.  Results:   CYP1B1 expression was significantly increased in CRPC tissues and androgen-independent PCa cell lines. CYP1B1+ PCa cells were significantly enriched in bicalutamide-treated LNCaP cells, and CYP1B1 knockdown reduced the cell viability under bicalutamide treatment. In addition, CYP1B1 knockdown decreased the intracellular 4-OHE2 concentration, accompanied by reduced PCSC characteristics. In PCa cells, 4-OHE2 stimulated ERα transcriptional activity and upregulated the expression of IL6 and downstream genes of the IL6-STAT3 signaling. 4-OHE2 increased cell viability under bicalutamide treatment and promoted PCSC characteristics, while IL6 neutralizing antibody reversed these effects. Mechanistically, siERα and the ER antagonist ICI182780 significantly attenuated 4-OHE2-induced IL6 expression, and 4-OHE2 promoted the binding of ERα to the estrogen response element of the IL6 promoter.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that CYP1B1-catalyzed 4-OHE2 enhanced PCSC characteristics and attenuated bicalutamide sensitivity by ERα-mediated the IL6-STAT3 pathway activation. Our study further emphasizes the role of CYP1B1 in castration resistance and illustrates a novel mechanism of CRPC development.

Radiation cystitis was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 definition, and severe radiation cystitis was defined as grade 3 or higher. All medical records were reviewed to calculate the cumulative incidence of radiation cystitis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate its association with clinicopathologic features.  Results:   The median follow-up period after radiation therapy was 56 months (range 5-81). The 5-year cumulative incidence of radiation cystitis and severe radiation cystitis was 16.2% and 3.0%, respectively. Multivariate analyses identified radiation therapy in the adjuvant/salvage setting was the sole risk factor associated with the development of radiation cystitis (hazard ratio: 2.75, p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Radiation therapy in the post-prostatectomy setting was associated with increased risk of radiation cystitis compared with radiotherapy as the primary treatment.""","""['Katsuhiro Makino', 'Yusuke Sato', 'Ryosuke Takenaka', 'Hideomi Yamashita', 'Yoshiyuki Akiyama', 'Yuta Yamada', 'Masaki Nakamura', 'Taketo Kawai', 'Daisuke Yamada', 'Motofumi Suzuki', 'Haruki Kume']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Cumulative incidence and predictive factors of radiation cystitis in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Last resort surgical management of postradiation urinary cystitis after external beam radiation for prostate cancer: a monocentric analysis.', 'Improved toxicity profile following high-dose postprostatectomy salvage radiation therapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.', 'Adjuvant and Salvage Radiotherapy after Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed all consecutive patients admitted to two institutions for radical prostatectomy for PCa with available records of mpMRI performed between January 2015 and December 2020. Data from one institution was used for investigating diagnostic performance of each mEPE feature using radical prostatectomy specimens as benchmark. The results were implemented in a mEPE-score as follows: no mEPE features: 1; capsular abutment: 2; irregular or spiculated margin: 3; bulging prostatic contour, or asymmetry of the neurovascular bundles, or tumor-capsule interface > 1.0 cm: 4; ≥ 2 of the previous three parameters or measurable extraprostatic disease: 5. The performance of mEPE features was evaluated using the five diagnostic parameters and ROC curve analysis.  Results:   Two-hundred patients were enrolled at site 1 and 76 at site 2. mEPE features had poor sensitivities ranging from 0.08 (0.00-0.15) to 0.71 (0.59-0.83), whereas specificity ranged from 0.68 (0.58-0.79) to 1.00. mEPE-score showed excellent discriminating ability (AUC > 0.8) and sensitivity = 0.82 and specificity = 0.77 with a threshold of 3. mEPE-score had AUC comparable to ESUR-score (p = 0.59 internal validation; p = 0.82 external validation), higher than or comparable to mEPE-grade (p = 0.04 internal validation; p = 0.58 external validation), and higher than early-and-late-EPE (p < 0.0001 internal and external validation). There were no significant differences between readers having different expertise with EPE-score (p = 0.32) or mEPE-grade (p = 0.45), but there were significant differences for ESUR-score (p = 0.02) and early-versus-late-EPE (p = 0.03).

Yet, whether this finding applies irrespective of the number of positive lymph nodes (LNs) after adjusting for the time-dependent use and duration of androgen deprivation therapy is unknown and is addressed in the current study.  Methods:   Univariable and multivariable Cox regression was used to evaluate whether the ACM risk ratio for time-dependent use of adjuvant versus early sRT per unit increase in positive pelvic LNs was significantly reduced. Adjusted ACM estimates were calculated among men who received adjuvant, early salvage, or no RT stratified by one to three or four or more positive pelvic LNs.  Results:   After a median follow-up of 7.02 years, 986 (5.50%) men died, with 223 (22.62%) of PC. Adjuvant compared with early sRT was associated with a significantly lower ACM risk per unit increase in positive pelvic LNs (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.99; P = .03). A significant difference in the 7-year adjusted ACM estimates favoring aRT versus early sRT was observed in men with four or more positive LNs (7.74% v 23.36%) in that the 95% CI for the 15.62% difference (5.90 to 25.35) excluded 0.00, but this was not true for men with 1-3 positive LNs (14.27% v 13.89%; 95% CI for the 0.38% difference [-7.02 to 7.79]).

Lycopene is a carotenoid found in chloroplasts and chromoplasts of tomatoes, providing the familiar red color, and a bioactive that inhibits prostate carcinogenesis. We employed live-cell Raman microscopy to visualize lycopene delivery from tween 80 micelles into PC-3 prostate cancer cells. The tween 80 micelle provides a mimic of natural lipoprotein complexes that deliver lycopene in vivo, overcomes the low aqueous solubility of lycopene and challenges replicating physiological uptake to cells, and provides a stable signal to assess cellular uptake of the nutraceutical formulation. The Raman images indicate subcellular localization of the lycopene within the cells. The lycopene Raman signal is resonantly enhanced at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, providing a convenient, sensitive, and label-free technique to detect and quantify lycopene uptake in living cells. Analysis of the acquired Raman spectra in the maps determines the concentration of lycopene at each point in the cell. In addition to the expected lycopene Raman signal, Raman scattering from the tween 80 vehicle is also mapped in the cells. The Raman data correlates with scattering features observed in darkfield microscopy images of the cells, which display the cell membrane and other features for reference.

However, few data describe the tumor immune contexture in relation to RT sensitivity. To address this challenge, we used the radiation sensitivity index (RSI) gene signature to estimate the RT sensitivity of >10,000 primary tumors and characterized their immune microenvironments in relation to the RSI.  Methods and materials:   We analyzed gene expression profiles of 10,469 primary tumors (31 types) within a prospective tissue collection protocol. The RT sensitivity of each tumor was estimated by the RSI and respective distributions were characterized. The tumor biology measured by the RSI was evaluated by differentially expressed genes combined with single sample gene set enrichment analysis. Differences in the expression of immune regulatory molecules were assessed and deconvolution algorithms were used to estimate immune cell infiltrates in relation to the RSI. A subset (n = 2368) of tumors underwent DNA sequencing for mutational frequency characterization.  Results:   We identified a wide range of RSI values within and across various tumor types, with several demonstrating nonunimodal distributions (eg, colon, renal, lung, prostate, esophagus, pancreas, and PAM50 breast subtypes; P < .05). Across all tumor types, stratifying RSI at a tumor type-specific median identified 7148 differentially expressed genes, of which 146 were coordinate in direction. Network topology analysis demonstrates RSI measures a coordinated STAT1, IRF1, and CCL4/MIP-1β transcriptional network. Tumors with an estimated high sensitivity to RT demonstrated distinct enrichment of interferon-associated signaling pathways and immune cell infiltrates (eg, CD8+ T cells, activated natural killer cells, M1-macrophages; q < 0.05), which was in the context of diverse expression patterns of various immunoregulatory molecules.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) with GS 9-10 PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) or external beam radiation therapy with androgen deprivation therapy (EBRT+ADT) from 1/2000 to 12/2010.

Results:   We identified 1220 veterans with GS 9-10 PCa; 335 were treated with RP, and 885 were treated with EBRT+ADT. With a median follow-up of 9.9 years, propensity score-matched analyses demonstrated that RP had superior 10-year OS (70.8% [RP] vs. 61.2% [EBRT+ADT], p < 0.001), 10-year DMFS rates were similar between RP (76.7%) and EBRT+ADT (81.0%), and 10-year SAFS rates were lower for RP vs EBRT + ADT (35.2% [RP] vs. 75.2% [EBRT+ADT], p < 0.001). The receipt of salvage ADT was higher with upfront RP (51.9% vs. 26.1%, p < 0.001), despite receipt of adjuvant/salvage EBRT in 41.8% of RP patients. Among patients treated with RP, there were no differences in outcomes by race. However, higher survival rates were noted among Black patients treated with EBRT+ADT compared with White patients.  Conclusions:   This analysis demonstrated higher 10-year OS rates among men treated with upfront RP versus EBRT+ADT, though missing confounders and similar DMFS rates suggest the long-term cause-specific OS rates may be similar.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the crosstalk between ECs and adipocytes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that local production of polyamines in ECs stimulates adipocyte lipolysis and regulates WAT homeostasis in mice. We promote enhanced cell-autonomous angiogenesis by deleting Pten in the murine endothelium. Endothelial Pten loss leads to a WAT-selective phenotype, characterized by reduced body weight and adiposity in pathophysiological conditions. This phenotype stems from enhanced fatty acid β-oxidation in ECs concomitant with a paracrine lipolytic action on adipocytes, accounting for reduced adiposity. Combined analysis of murine models, isolated ECs and human specimens reveals that WAT lipolysis is mediated by mTORC1-dependent production of polyamines by ECs.

Methods:   Our objective was to validate and compare prediction models selecting newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients for bone scan staging. To achieve this, we validated eleven models in a population-based cohort of 10,721 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2005 and 2019. The primary outcome was net-benefit. This was assessed at different balances of conservatism and tolerance, represented by preference ratio and number-willing-to-test (NWT). Secondary outcomes included calibration slope, calibration-in-the-large (intercept), and discrimination measured by Area-under-the-receiver-operator-characteristics curve (AUC).  Results:   For preference ratios less than 1:39 (NWT greater than 40), scanning everyone provided greater net-benefit than selective staging. For preference ratios 1:39 to 3:97 (NWT 33-40), the European Association of Urology (EAU) 2020 guideline recommendation was the best approach. For preference ratios 3:97-7:93 (NWT 14-33), scanning EAU high-risk patients only was preferable. For preference ratios 7:93-1:9 (NWT 10-13), scanning only Gnanapragasam Group 5 patients was best. All models had similar fair discrimination (AUCs 0.68-0.80), but most had poor calibration.  Conclusions:   We identified three selective staging strategies that outperformed all other approaches but did so over different ranges of conservatism and tolerance.

Actually, the measurement of prostate-specific antigen level in blood is affected by limited sensitivity and specificity and cannot discriminate PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia patients (BPH). In the present paper, 20 urine samples from BPH patients and 20 from PCa patients were investigated to develop a metabolomics strategy useful to distinguish malignancy from benign hyperplasia. A UHPLC-HRMS untargeted approach was carried out to generate two large sets of candidate biomarkers. After mass spectrometric analysis, an innovative chemometric data treatment was employed involving PLS-DA classification with repeated double cross-validation and permutation test to provide a rigorously validated PLS-DA model. Simultaneously, this chemometric approach filtered out the most effective biomarkers and optimized their relative weights to yield the highest classification efficiency.

While approximately three-quarters of all cases present as localized disease, the rate of metastatic disease has been increasing. Common sites of metastatic prostate cancer include regional lymph nodes, bones, and lungs. In this case report, we discuss a man with a history of low-risk prostate cancer who developed a testicular mass, which was ultimately diagnosed as a solitary testicular metastasis. CASE REPORT An abnormal nodule on the left apex area was identified on a digital rectal exam of an otherwise healthy 67-year-old man in February 2008. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided transrectal biopsy of the prostate gland in April 2008. The biopsy demonstrated adenocarcinoma of the prostate, Gleason 6 (3+3), with tumor present in 3 out of 12 submitted cores in up to 20% of biopsy specimens. Following treatment, his prostate cancer remained quiescent for several years. He was also found to have a urethral bulbar stricture that required dilation; during the procedure, a nurse detected an abnormality in the right testicle while prepping the patient. A follow-up testicular ultrasound in September 2020 identified an abnormal heterogeneous area with calcifications within the right testicle. Following radical right orchiectomy, pathology revealed metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma, acinar type, with lymphovascular invasion present at the spermatic cord margin. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance for prostate cancer following treatment, even for low-risk disease, should always be continued. Although rare, recurrence and metastasis can occur in patients with low and even absent post-treatment prostate-specific antigen levels.""","""['Kaden DiMarco', 'Michael Johnson', 'David Esrig', 'David DiMarco']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Case Rep""","""['Prostate cancer involving bilateral seminal vesicles along with bone and testicular metastases: a case report.', 'Small cell carcinoma of the prostate presenting with skin metastasis: a case report.', 'Metastasis of Prostate Adenocarcinoma to the Testis.', 'Bilateral secondary testicular, epididymal and spermatic cords carcinoma of prostatic origin: a case report and review of the\xa0literature.', 'Atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP): Is a repeat biopsy necessary ASAP?

A total of 34 prostate cancer patients with intermediate and high risk were included in this prospective study. Each patient in the intermediate risk group received a total of 78 Gy in 39 fractions for prostate and seminal vesicles. In patients in the high risk group, 2 Gy daily fraction dose for pelvic lymphatics was given to 50 Gy, and then 78 Gy was given to prostate and seminal vesicles volumes. Treatment plans were created for all patients using the IMRT technique with 6MV. Testicular doses were measured for WPRT and PORT by thermoluminescence dosimetry (TLD) detectors placed on testis surface. Testicular doses measured for WPRT and PORT were compared. The isocenter to testicular distance for WPRT and PORT was 16.83-cm (13.20 to 18.80-cm) and 11.15 cm (9.10 to 13.00-cm), respectively. The mean testicular dose measurements of TPS and TLD per fraction during PORT were 2.41 cGy (1.95 to 3.60 cGy) and 3.70 cGy (2.80 to 5.10 cGy), respectively (p = 0.00). In WPRT irradiation, mean testicular dose values of TPS and TLD per fraction were measured as 3.85 cGy (2.00 to 5.70 cGy) and 5.85 cGy (4.25 to 7.55 cGy), respectively (p = 0.00). The cumulative mean scattered dose for PORT irradiation of 78 Gy in 39 fractions was 144.30 cGy. The mean cumulative dose received by the testis for the high-risk prostate patient was 228.15 cGy. There was a significant difference in testicular dose between WPRT and PORT irradiation. Testicular doses decreased significantly with increasing isocenter-testis distance. Incidental testicular dose during prostate radiotherapy can be significantly detrimental to spermatogenesis.

However, oligozoospermia and azoospermia after administration of CDDP are clinical problems. One of the testicular toxicities of CDDP is known to cause oxidative stress. Tadalafil has been reported to exhibit antioxidant effects and is widely used in clinical practice to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and erectile dysfunction. Rho-kinase α (ROCK2) regulates cell migration and apoptosis and has been reported to be involved in CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity. The excessive expression of ROCK2 is known to cause oxidative stress.  Objective:   The objective of the current study was to test the effect of tadalafil on the testicular toxicity of CDDP.  Material and methods:   Thirty-two rats were used and divided into the following four groups. (1) The control group (CONT), treated with saline on day 1 and saline and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on days 1-10 intraperitoneally (i.p.) (2) The Tadalafil Group (TAD), treated with saline on day 1, and 0.4 mg/kg tadalafil on days 1-10 i.p. (3) The CDDP group (CD), treated with 7 mg/kg CDDP, saline, and DMSO on days 1-10 i.p. and (4) The CDDP + TAD group (CDT) was treated with 7 mg/kg CDDP on day 1, and 0.4 mg/kg tadalafil on days 1-10 i.p. Testes and epididymides samples were collected on day 11. Biochemical and pathological analyses and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were performed on the excised specimens.  Results:   CDDP treatment resulted in testicular atrophy, decreased sperm concentration, and atrophy of seminiferous tubules as observed from the testicular histology. Increased apoptosis of seminiferous tubules, oxidative stress, and ROCK2 mRNA expression were observed after CDDP treatment. Treatment with tadalafil improved these adverse effects.  Conclusion:   Tadalafil is a potential drug for reducing CDDP-induced spermatogenic dysfunction. The antioxidant effect of tadalafil may be partly responsible for this phenomenon. ROCK2 and oxidative stress markers may be involved in the possible antioxidant effects of tadalafil. Tadalafil may be considered as one of a treatment option for reducing spermatogenic dysfunction after administration of CDDP.""","""['Yasuhiro Kaku', 'Koji Chiba', 'Katsuya Sato', 'Atsushi Onishi', 'Takaki Ishida', 'Keisuke Okada', 'Masato Fujisawa']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Cardioprotective role of tadalafil against cisplatin-induced cardiovascular damage in rats.', 'Tadalafil alleviates cisplatin-induced reproductive toxicity through the activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and the inhibition of oxidative stress and apoptosis in male rats.', 'Resveratrol improves sperm parameter and testicular apoptosis in cisplatin-treated rats: Effects on ERK1/2, JNK, and Akt pathways.', 'Protective effect of tadalafil and verapamil on testicular function and oxidative stress after torsion/detorsion in adult male rat.', 'Improvement of cisplatin-induced injuries to sperm quality, the oxidant-antioxidant system, and the histologic structure of the rat testis by ellagic acid.']"""

However, prior trials of DSF in PC used DSF as monotherapy.  Objective:   To assess the safety and efficacy of concurrent administration of DSF with Cu, we conducted a phase 1b clinical trial of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving Cu with DSF.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients with mCRPC were treated in two cohorts: mCRPC with nonliver/peritoneal metastases (A), and mCRPC with liver and/or peritoneal metastases (B). Baseline Cu avidity was measured by 64 CuCl2 PET scan. Intravenous (IV) CuCl2 was given weekly for three doses with oral daily DSF followed by daily oral Cu gluconate and DSF until disease progression. DSF and metabolite diethyldithiocarbamic acid methyl ester (Me-DDC) levels in plasma were measured. DSF and Me-DDC were then assessed for cytotoxicity in vitro.  Results:   We treated nine patients with mCRPC (six on cohort A and three on cohort B). Bone and nodal metastases showed differential and heterogeneous Cu uptake on 64 CuCl2 PET scans. No confirmed PSA declines or radiographic responses were observed. Median PFS was 2.8 months and median OS was 8.3 months. Common adverse events included fatigue and psychomotor depression; no Grade 4/5 AEs were observed. Me-DDC was measurable in all samples (LOQ = 0.512 ng/ml), whereas DSF was not (LOQ = 0.032 ng/ml, LOD = 0.01 ng/ml); Me-DDC was not cytotoxic in vitro.

In our previous study, we found kaempferol could act as a selective androgen receptor modulator, thereby suppress development of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This finding inspired us to further explore the effect and the mechanism of action of kaempferol on prostate cancer.  Methods:   Plate clone formation assay was performed to detect the effect of kaempferol on cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to detect the impact of kaempferol on cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution. qPCR, immunofluorescence staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to detect the expression of gene and protein of Ki67 which is a biomarker of cell proliferation.  Results:   In the present study, we found kaempferol could dramatically suppress androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells proliferation and induce their apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that kaempferol induced cell cycle to be arrested at G1 phase in 22Rv1 cells but at S and G2 phase in PC-3 cells. In addition, we detected the mRNA and protein of Ki67 which is corresponding to the cell proliferation and found that kaempferol could significantly inhibit Ki67 expression at mRNA level but increase its expression at protein levels in both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   Taken together, kaempferol inhibited the proliferation of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer cells by regulating the expression of Ki67.

Little is known about splice-disrupt genomic variants.  Methods and results:   Here, pattern of splice-disrupt variants was investigated using 21,842,764 genomic variants in different types of prostate cancer. A particular attention was paid to genomic locations of splice-disrupt variants on target genes. HLA-A in prostate cancer, MSR1 in familial prostate cancer, and EGFR in both castration-resistant prostate cancer and metastatic castration-resistant had the highest allele frequencies of splice-disrupt variations. Some splice-disrupt variants, located on coding sequences of NCOR2, PTPRC, and CRP, were solely present in the advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. High-risk splice-disrupt variants were identified based on computationally calculated Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen), Sorting Intolerant From Tolerant (SIFT), and Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP) + + scores as well as the recorded clinical significance in dbSNP database of NCBI. Functional annotation of damaging splice-disrupt variants highlighted important cancer-associated functions, including endocrine resistance, lipid metabolic process, steroid metabolic process, regulation of mitotic cell cycle, and regulation of metabolic process. This is the first study that profiles the splice-disrupt genomic variants and their target genes in prostate cancer. Literature mining based variant analysis highlighted the importance of rs1800716 variant, located on the CYP2D6 gene, involved in a range of important functions, such as RNA spicing, drug interaction, death, and urotoxicity.

We aimed to evaluate the site-specific incidence, prognosis, and risk factors for metachronous SPMs following thyroid cancer.  Design:   A nationwide cohort study.  Methods:   This study included data from the Korea National Health Insurance Service (between 2002 and 2018). Exposure to diagnostic radiation was defined by the number of computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT scans after the index date. A cumulative radioactive iodine (RAI) dose >100 mCi was considered high-dose RAI.  Results:   During the median 6 years of follow-up, among 291 640 patients, 13 083 (4.5%) developed SPMs. Thyroid cancer survivors had a 26% increased risk of SPMs compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.22-1.29). Furthermore, those with SPMs had a significantly poorer survival rate than those without SPMs (hazard ratio: 11.85; 95% CI: 11.21-12.54; P < 0.001). Significantly elevated risks were observed in myeloid leukemia and 13 solid cancer sites: lip, salivary gland, small intestine, larynx, lung, mediastinum and pleura, mesothelium, breast, corpus uteri, ovary, prostate, kidney, and bladder. Frequent diagnostic medical radiation exposure and high-dose RAI therapy were independent risk factors for several SPMs, including the cancer of salivary gland, lung, mediastinum and pleura, breast, kidney, and bladder, as well as myeloid leukemia.  Conclusions:   Frequent diagnostic radiation exposure and high-dose RAI therapy are independent risk factors for SPM following thyroid cancer. Clinicians need to consider minimizing unnecessary diagnostic radiation exposure and administering a high dose RAI only when justified in patients with thyroid cancer.""","""['Mijin Kim', 'Hyereen Kim', 'Sojeong Park', 'Jaeeun Joo', 'In Ju Kim', 'Bo Hyun Kim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Endocrinol""","""['Second primary malignancy risk after radioactive iodine treatment for thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Use of Radioactive Iodine for Thyroid Cancer and Risk of Second Primary Malignancy: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.', 'Increased risk of second primary malignancy in pediatric and young adult patients treated with radioactive iodine for differentiated thyroid cancer.', 'Rising incidence of second cancers in patients with low-risk (T1N0) thyroid cancer who receive radioactive iodine therapy.', 'Second primary malignancies induced by radioactive iodine treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma - a critical review and evaluation of the existing evidence.', 'Risk prediction of second primary malignant tumor in primary differentiated thyroid cancer patients: a population-based study.', 'Linear association between radioactive iodine dose and second primary malignancy risk in thyroid cancer.', 'Big Data Research in the Field of Endocrine Diseases Using the Korean National Health Information Database.']"""

Concern has been raised that, by recommending against screening, and thus early detection, the USPSTF recommendations may be associated with an increase in the incidence of metastatic PCa (mPCa).  Objective:   To explore the incidence of mPCa before and after the USPSTF recommendations against routine PCa screening.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study used the recently released Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry incidence data to identify men aged 45 years and older with a diagnosis of invasive PCa from 2004 through 2018. Data were analyzed from January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2018.  Exposure:   Outcomes were assessed before vs after the USPSTF recommendations against routine screening.  Main outcomes and measures:   Annual age-adjusted incidence rates per 100 000 population of mPCa (defined using SEER Summary Stage and American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] staging systems), with adjustments for age structure and reporting delay from 2004 to 2011, according to race and age were examined. Annual percentage changes (APCs) were calculated to quantify changes in the annual incidence rates.  Results:   From 2004 to 2018, a total of 836 282 patients with PCa were recorded in the SEER database; 26 642 (56.5%) distant mPCa cases were reported in men aged 45 to 74 years, and 20 507 (43.5%) cases were reported in men aged 75 years or older. Among men aged 45 to 74 years, the incidence rate of distant mPCa (SEER Summary staging) remained stable during 2004 to 2010 (APC, -0.4%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 1.1%; P = .60), then increased significantly during 2010 to 2018 (APC, 5.3%; 95% CI, 4.5% to 6.0%; P < .001). In men aged 75 years or older, the incidence rate of distant mPCa decreased from 2004 to 2011 (APC, -1.5%; 95% CI, -3.0% to 0%; P = .046), and then increased from 2011 to 2018 (APC, 6.5%; 95% CI, 5.1% to 7.8%; P < .001). Similar trends were also seen for M1 mPCa defined per the AJCC staging system. These increased trends in mPCa incidence were particularly significant in non-Hispanic White men (2010-2018 APC, 6.9%; 95% CI, 5.4% to 8.4%; P < .001).  Conclusions and relevance:   Analysis of the emerging trends from the most recently released SEER data set (2004-2018) suggests that the incidence rates of mPCa have increased significantly and coincide temporally with the USPSTF recommendations against PCa screening across races and age groups. These mPCa trends are associated with reported changes in screening practices following the USPSTF recommendations.""","""['Mihir M Desai', 'Giovanni E Cacciamani', 'Karanvir Gill', 'Juanjuan Zhang', 'Lihua Liu', 'Andre Abreu', 'Inderbir S Gill']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Striking the Right Balance With Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate Cancer Incidence and PSA Testing Patterns in Relation to USPSTF Screening Recommendations.', 'Changing Incidence of Metastatic Prostate Cancer by Race and Age, 1988-2015.', 'Rates and trends in stage-specific prostate cancer incidence by age and race/ethnicity, 2000-2017.', 'Increase in the Annual Rate of Newly Diagnosed Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Contemporary Analysis of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Database.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'American Indian/Alaska Native men are less likely to receive prostate-specific antigen testing and digital rectal exams from primary care providers than White men: a secondary analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 2012-2018.', 'PARP inhibitors in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Personalizing approaches to the management of metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: role of advanced imaging, genetics and therapeutics.', 'Effects of In-office Dispensing by Single-specialty Urology Practices on Management of Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'A vision for closing the evidence-practice gap in the management of low-grade prostate cancer.']"""

Actually, the interaction between cancer cells and bone microenvironment plays important role in prostate cancer bone metastasis, especially the Sonic hedgehog protein (SHH) signaling in the bone microenvironment. The SHH promotes osteoblast maturation and osteoblast then secretes RANKL to induce osteoclastogenesis. Herein, this study develops bone-targeting calcium phosphate lipid hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with docetaxel (DTXL) and SHH siRNA for PCa bone metastasis treatment. For bone targeting purposes, the nanoplatform was modified with alendronate (ALN). (DTXL + siRNA)@NPs-ALN NPs effectively change the bone microenvironment by inhibiting the SHH paracrine and autocrine signaling, enhancing the anti-tumor effects of DTXL. Besides showing good in vitro cellular uptake, the NPs-ALN also inhibited tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and autophagy.

Patient was treated to doses of 45 Gy to the primary tumor site and nodal regions over 25 fractions using VMAT and 100 Gy to the prostate using prostate seed implant (PSI). In VMAT plans of patients with no spacer, mean doses of rectal wall were 43.6, 42.4, 40.1, and 28.8 Gy to the volume of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 cm3 , respectively. In patients with SpaceOAR, average rectal wall doses decreased to 39.0, 36.9, 33.5, and 23.9 Gy to the volume of 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 cm3 , respectively (p < 0.01).

The mortality rate of lung cancer patients has continued to rise in recent years. Several studies revealed that the expression of melanoma antigen 6 (MAGE-A6) promoted the development of multiple types of cancer. In addition, the suppression of AMPK pathway could restrict the radiosensitization of prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of MAGE-A6 activated the AMPK pathway in colorectal cancer cells. However, whether the MAGE-A6 could regulate the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells by regulating of the AMPK pathway is unclear. In this study, we established the MAGE-A6 knockdown in A549 and H1299 cells. Next, the apoptosis and proliferation of these cells were detected by the flow cytometry analysis and colony formation assay after the irradiation, respectively. Then, the expression of p-AMPKα1 and p-S6K1 in these cells was explored by the western blotting. After that, we inhibited the expression of AMPKα1 in MAGE-A6 knockdown cells. The proliferation and apoptosis of these cells were detected with colony formation assay and flow cytometry analysis. Finally, the tumor formation of these cells was detected in nude mice. Our results showed that inhibition of MAGE-A6 suppressed the proliferation and aggravated the apoptosis of A549 and H1299 cells after the irradiation. Knockdown of MAGE-A6 activated the expression of p-AMPKα1 and repressed the expression of p-S6K1 in these cells. Suppression of AMPKα1 in MAGE-A6 knockdown cells abolished these effects. Knockdown of MAGE-A6 also enhanced the radiosensitivity of these cells in vivo. These results suggested that inhibition of MAGE-A6 promoted the radiosensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells by activating AMPK pathway. Therefore, MAGE-6 has the potential to be explored as the therapeutic target for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in clinical.""","""['Jialiang Zhou', 'Qiang Fan', 'Jie Li', 'Jia Wu', 'Jianfeng Huang', 'Yunxia Zhang', 'Xiuyun He']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol""","""['Knockdown of MAGEA6 Activates AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) Signaling to Inhibit Human Renal Cell Carcinoma Cells.', 'Baicalin, a Chinese Herbal Medicine, Inhibits the Proliferation and Migration of Human Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) Cells, A549 and H1299, by Activating the SIRT1/AMPK Signaling Pathway.', 'Ad-apoptin inhibits glycolysis, migration and invasion in lung cancer cells targeting AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Inhibition on Numb/Notch signal pathway enhances radiosensitivity of lung cancer cell line H358.', 'Inhibition of protein phosphatase 5 suppresses non-small cell lung cancer through AMP-activated kinase activation.']"""

Beneficiaries contributed to the annual cost calculations (Years 1-5) using their observed time after diagnosis. Beneficiaries were continuously enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare Parts A/B and Part D during follow-up. Total, inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy cancer-related service costs were calculated.  Results:   From 2012 to 2016, we identified 597,778 Medicare beneficiaries with incident cancer diagnosis within 5 years (Stage I, II, III, and IV: 32.6%, 33.4%, 15.9%, and 18.0%, respectively). In Year 1, mean (standard deviation) total costs for Stage I diagnoses varied from $7640 ($17,378) (prostate) to $94,636 ($117,636) (pancreas). Total costs increased by stage and reached $58,783 ($92,344) (prostate) to $156,982 ($175,009) (stomach) for Stage IV diagnoses in Year 1. Costs in Year 1 were significantly higher for Stage IV diagnoses than for earlier stages across all cancer types. In Years 2-5, total costs were lower than in Year 1 but continued to increase by stage.

Initially mobilized as an elixir for men's talk about health practices and illness experiences, participant-produced photographs and accompanying narratives have grown significantly in reach, influence, and application. The current article highlights the gendered dimensions of photovoice in men's health promotion research across three studies addressing (1) psychosocial prostate cancer care, (2) fathers' tobacco reduction and smoking cessation, and (3) male suicidality. Insights drawn from the psychosocial prostate cancer care project emphasize the plurality of masculinities, and the implications for health promoters treating the common treatment side effect of erectile dysfunction. The relational nature of gender is central to the fathers' tobacco reduction and smoking cessation work whereby the well-being of partners and children strongly influenced men's behavior changes amid guiding adjustments to smoke-free policies. The male suicidality research highlights the unmuting powers of photovoice for making visible the interiority of men's mental illness, and the destigmatizing potentials for sharing participants' accompanying narratives. Evident across the three projects are the gendered dimensions of photovoice processes and products for advancing understandings of, and avenues toward, promoting the health of men and their families.

The purpose of this analysis was to assess oncologic outcomes and toxicity in a large cohort of patients treated with conventionally fractionated three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy (CF) and hypofractionated volumetric modulated arc therapy (HF) after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Between 1994 and 2019, a total of 855 patients with prostate carcinoma were treated by postoperative radiotherapy using CF (total dose 65-72 Gy, single fraction 1.8-2 Gy) in 572 patients and HF (total dose 62.5-63.75 Gy, single fraction 2.5-2.55 Gy) in 283 patients. The association of treatment modality with biochemical control, overall survival (OS), and gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity was assessed using logistic and Cox regression analysis.  Results:   There was no difference between the two modalities regarding biochemical control rates (77% versus 81%, respectively, for HF and CF at 24 months and 58% and 64% at 60 months; p = 0.20). OS estimates after 5 years: 95% versus 93% (p = 0.72). Patients undergoing HF had less frequent grade 2 or higher acute GI or GU side effects (p = 0.03 and p = 0.005, respectively). There were no differences in late GI side effects between modalities (hazard ratio 0.99). Median follow-up was 23 months for HF and 72 months for CF (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   For radiation therapy of resected prostate cancer, our analysis of this largest single-centre cohort (n = 283) treated with hypofractionation with advanced treatment techniques compared with conventional fractionation did not yield different outcomes in terms of biochemical control and toxicities.

This study aimed at (1) specifically recording medicinal plants traditionally used for the treatment of cancer in Hammanskraal and Winterveld, South Africa, and (2) documenting the different methods of preparation and administration of those medicinal plants as recorded during the study.  Method:   An open-ended semi-structured questionnaire was administered to 90 willing traditional healers in Hammanskraal and Winterveld area, Tshwane Municipality, South Africa to document plants used for cancer treatments. The study was conducted over a period of six months (July - December, 2018). Descriptive statistics was used to present the obtained data.  Results:   The study recorded twenty-eight plant species belonging to 18 families for the treatment of different types of cancer. Plant species in the Fabaceae family particularly Lessertia frutescens (L.) Goldblatt and J.C.

Thus, readers deciding on RLT must have certainty on the repeatability of PSMA uptake metrics. As such, we aimed to evaluate the test-retest repeatability of lesion uptake in a large cohort of patients imaged with 18F-DCFPyL.  Methods:   In this prospective, IRB-approved trial (NCT03793543), 21 patients with history of histologically proven PC underwent two 18F-DCFPyL PET/CTs within 7 days (mean 3.7, range 1 to 7 days). Lesions in the bone, lymph nodes (LN), and other organs were manually segmented on both scans, and uptake parameters were assessed (maximum (SUVmax) and mean (SUVmean) SUVs), PSMA-tumor volume (PSMA-TV), and total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA, defined as PSMA - TV × SUVmean)). Repeatability was determined using Pearson's correlations, within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), and Bland-Altman analysis.  Results:   In total, 230 pairs of lesions (177 bone, 38 LN, and 15 other) were delineated, demonstrating a wide range of SUVmax (1.5-80.5) and SUVmean (1.4-24.8). Including all sites of suspected disease, SUVs had a strong interscan correlation (R 2 ≥ 0.99), with high repeatability for SUVmean and SUVmax (wCOV, 7.3% and 12.1%, respectively). High SUVs showed significantly improved wCOV relative to lower SUVs (P < 0.0001), indicating that high SUVs are more repeatable, relative to the magnitude of the underlying SUV. Repeatability for PSMA-TV and TL-PSMA, however, was low (wCOV ≥ 23.5%). Across all metrics for LN and bone lesions, interscan correlation was again strong (R 2 ≥ 0.98). Moreover, LN-based SUVmean also achieved the best wCOV (3.8%), which was significantly reduced when compared to osseous lesions (7.8%, P < 0.0001). This was also noted for SUVmax (wCOV, LN 8.8% vs. bone 12.0%, P < 0.03). On a compartment-based level, wCOVs for volumetric features were ≥22.8%, demonstrating no significant differences between LN and bone lesions (PSMA-TV, P =0.63; TL-PSMA, P =0.9). Findings on an entire tumor burden level were also corroborated in a hottest lesion analysis investigating the SUVmax of the most intense lesion per patient (R 2, 0.99; wCOV, 11.2%).  Conclusion:   In this prospective test-retest setting, SUV parameters demonstrated high repeatability, in particular in LNs, while volumetric parameters demonstrated low repeatability. Further, the large number of lesions and wide distribution of SUVs included in this analysis allowed for the demonstration of a dependence of repeatability on SUV, with higher SUVs having more robust repeatability.""","""['Rudolf A Werner', 'Bilêl Habacha', 'Susanne Lütje', 'Lena Bundschuh', 'Takahiro Higuchi', 'Philipp Hartrampf', 'Sebastian E Serfling', 'Thorsten Derlin', 'Constantin Lapa', 'Andreas K Buck', 'Markus Essler', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Mark C Markowski', 'Laura Shinehouse', 'Rehab AbdAllah', 'Ali Salavati', 'Martin A Lodge', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Ralph A Bundschuh', 'Steven P Rowe']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Imaging""","""['Lack of repeatability of radiomic features derived from PET scans: Results from a 18 F-DCFPyL test-retest cohort.', 'Test-retest repeatability of organ uptake on PSMA-targeted 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Repeatability of Quantitative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Measurements in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Repeatability of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT-Derived Total Molecular Tumor Volume.', 'Comparison of hybrid (68)Ga-PSMA PET/MRI and (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT in the evaluation of lymph node and bone metastases of prostate cancer.']"""

Long-term survival in men with penile squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) depends on accurately staging lymph node metastases. European Association of Urology (EAU) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recognize DSLNB as a standard for staging men with intermediate to high-risk tumors and clinically absent inguinal lymphadenopathy. DSLNB accuracy has been linked with pre-operative planning and surgical technique, yet no peer-reviewed video exists to establish an operative standard. Here we present a narrated video of our technique and discuss the accuracy of this approach using retrospective patient data.  Methods:   Ethics approval and patient consent was obtained. Retrospective analysis was performed on patients undergoing DSLNB for inguinal lymph node staging of histologically proven penile SCC. Data was included from 2 experienced uro-oncologists with subspecialty training in penile cancer working in Victoria, Australia between January 2015 and July 2021. Variables collected included Primary tumour histology, DSLNB pathology, progression to radical inguinal lymph node dissection (RILND) and recurrence patterns. DSLNB sensitivity and proportion of groins spared RILND is calculated.  Results:   DSLNB was performed on 127 groins (64 patients) during the study period. Within the cohort, 44% (n = 28) of patients had a pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Analysis of primary tumor intervention demonstrates that 82.8% (n = 53) of men underwent penile sparing surgery. Tumor histology in 88% of patients (n = 56) demonstrated pT1-pT2 disease. Overall n = 19 groins undergoing DSLNB were positive for malignancy and n = 108 were negative. 36 groins progressed to RILND during a mean follow up of 29 months. Only 2 groins that previously had a negative DSLNB were positive on RILND, one in the groin and one in the pelvis. We observed a false negative rate of 1.9% and a sensitivity of 90.5%. In our cohort DSLNB allowed 71.7% of groins to proceed for surveillance instead of prophylactic radical ILND.  Conclusions:   DSLNB is a safe and accurate method for assessing inguinal lymphadenopathy in men with intermediate to high-risk penile SCC and impalpable groins. This video study establishes an operative standard for DSLNB with oncological outcomes are consistent with international expectations. Standardized use of DSLNB by an experienced team will reduce morbidity while maintaining oncological safety for men with intermediate to high-risk penile cancer and cN0 disease.""","""[""Jonathan S O'Brien"", 'Jiasian Teh', 'Kenneth Chen', 'Brian D Kelly', 'Justin Chee', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Interrogating the Impassable: A Case Series and Literature Review of Unilateral SPECT-CT Groin Visualization in Men With Penile Cancer.', 'Evaluation of dynamic sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis and palpable inguinal nodes.', 'Lymph node metastasis in intermediate-risk penile squamous cell cancer: a two-centre experience.', 'Management of the lymph nodes in penile cancer.', 'Non-invasive and minimally invasive staging of regional lymph nodes in penile cancer.', 'Interrogating the Impassable: A Case Series and Literature Review of Unilateral SPECT-CT Groin Visualization in Men With Penile Cancer.']"""

However, knowledge gap persists on the influence of perceived self-vulnerability to prostate cancer on uptake of screening among male health workers; a demographic that has health insurance and is assumed to have knowledge of screening services for prostate cancer.  Objective:   This study aimed to assess the effect of perceived self-vulnerability to prostate cancer on screening uptake among male health workers in Kisumu County, western Kenya.  Methods:   This was a hospital-based cross-sectional study with a descriptive and analytical design. A modified self-administered questionnaire on self-vulnerability was issued to 197 male health workers who were randomly sampled from a study population of 336 eligible participants. The study was conducted at purposively selected public health facilities.  Findings:   Level of self-reported screening uptake was 27%. Rural residence (AOR = 0.71: 95% CI, 0.32-1.57, p = 0.019), education level (AOR = 5.01; 95% CI, 1.2-20.86, p = 0.027), participant's lack of knowledge about screening services covered by health insurance schemes of which they are members (AOR = 0.2, 95% CI, 0.08-0.5, p = 0.001), good perception of health status (AOR = 4; 95% CI: 1.52-10.53, p = 005) were determinants of screening uptake for prostate cancer. Perceived self-vulnerability to prostate cancer didn't influence screening uptake of participants (p < 0.05). Participants from rural set-up had a higher likelihood of perceiving themselves to be at risk of prostate cancer (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI, 1.17-4.72, p < 0.05) compared to those form urban settings. Old age of 60 years and above (AOR = 3.5, 95% CI: 0.3-40.98, p < 0.002) was predictive of perceived self-vulnerability.  Conclusion:   Findings from this study showed low uptake of screening and low perceived self-vulnerability to prostate cancer. Perceived self-vulnerability did not influence screening uptake for prostate cancer.

It is worth noting that many of the affected COVID-19 patients have malignant tumors. In addition, cancer has been identified as a personal risk factor for COVID-19. Transmembrane proteaseserine-2 (TMPRSS2) is a crucial host protease that mediates S protein activation and initially promotes virus entry into host cells. Moreover, it is abnormally expressed in a variety of tumors. However, the systematic analysis of TMPRSS2 aberrations in human cancer remains to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the genetic changes, RNA expression, and DNA methylation of TMPRSS2 in more than 30 tumors. It has been reported that TMPRSS2 is overexpressed in tumors such as prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and in contrast, the expression of TMPRSS2 is decreased in tumors such as head and neck cancer (HNSC). In addition, TMPRSS2 low DNA methylation was also found in most of these TMPRSS2 high-expressing tumors in this study. Clinical studies have found that there is a significant correlation between the expression of TMPRSS2 and the prognosis of some tumor patients. The expression of TMPRSS2 is also related to the infiltration of cancer-related fibroblasts, and the potential pathways and functional mechanisms were analyzed through KEGG/GO enrichment. In the end, our study planned the genetic and epigenetic variation of TMPRSS2 in human malignant tumors for the first time and provided a relatively comprehensive understanding of the carcinogenic effects of TMPRSS2.""","""['Yiming Meng', 'Jing Sun', 'Guirong Zhang', 'Tao Yu', 'Haozhe Piao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Pan‑cancer analysis of transmembrane protease serine 2 and cathepsin L that mediate cellular SARS‑CoV‑2 infection leading to COVID-19.', 'TMPRSS2 Correlated With Immune Infiltration Serves as a Prognostic Biomarker in Prostatic Adenocarcinoma: Implication for the COVID-2019.', 'Decreased TMPRSS2 expression by SARS-CoV-2 predicts the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients through metabolic pathways and immune infiltration.', 'A Review on Expression, Pathological Roles, and Inhibition of TMPRSS2, the Serine Protease Responsible for SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Activation.', 'Gene of the month: TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2).']"""

We have used an immunoscore for assessing level of expression of MOC31 as follows: 0 for <5% of positive cells, 1 for 5-30%, 2 for 31-50%, 3 for 51-70%.The total score resulted by summing the percentage score with the intensity score; the final score was varying from 0 to 7, considered low between 1-4 and high 5-7.  Results:   The mean age of patients was 45,2 years-old for PTC cases and 48,1 years-old for NIFTP cases. A net female predominance was found in both groups (male to female ratio of respectively 0,4 and 0,3). MOC31 expression was found in 19 cases of PTC with a percentage of positive cells varying from 5 to 90%. Percentage of positive cells was variable from 5 to 90%. The immunoscore for positive cells was: 0 in 5/24cases, 1 in 4/24cases, 3 in 9/24cases and 4 in 6/24cases. The intensity of staining was assessed score2 (moderate) in 8 cases and score 3 (high) in 7cases (Figure1-2). Final MOC31 staining score was low in 37,5% (9/24) and high in 62.5% (15/24). Patients with advanced pt2-pt3 stages mostly showed high score of MOC31 staining (61,5%).One case was associated with lymph node involvement and was of a high score. 6 cases showed vascular invasion and was of high MOC31 score. MOC31 was expressed in all NIFTP cases with variable proportion of positive cells (5%-80%). The immunoscore for positive cells was: 0 in 1/9cases, 1 in 2/9cases, 2 in 3/9cases, 3 in 1/9cases and 4 in 2/9cases. The intensity of staining was assessed score 1 (weak) in one case, score 2 (moderate) in 6 cases and score 3 (high) in one case (Figure3-4). The final combined score was low in 66,7 (6/9) and high in 33,3% (3/9).  Conclusion:   Our study revealed different immunohistochemical profile of MOC31 in benign and malignant tumors. It has somewhat a diffuse and marked staining in the first group. The changes of MOC31 location as well as its score of staining in PTC and NIFTP could hence be helpful in the differential diagnosis. Our findings also support the potential prognostic value of this molecule that deserves further investigations.""","""['Sarra Ben Rejeb', 'Dorsaf Beltaifa', 'Amen Ghozzi', 'Khadija Bellil', 'Senda Turki']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Tunis Med""","""['Ultrasound and cytological characteristics of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features compared to papillary carcinomas.', 'Diagnostic significance of apical membranous and cytoplasmic dot-like CD26 expression in encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma: a useful marker for capsular invasion.', 'Suggesting the cytologic diagnosis of noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP): A retrospective analysis of atypical and suspicious nodules.', 'Noninvasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm With Papillary-Like Nuclear Features in Children: An Institutional Experience and Literature Review.', 'The impact of non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features (NIFTP) on the diagnosis of thyroid nodules.']"""

However, those undergoing active surveillance remain underrepresented in the literature with less known about their unique challenges. Therefore, we aimed to explore their lived experiences post diagnosis and its effect on their mental, social, and physical wellbeing.  Methods:   Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 13 men undergoing active surveillance for low-risk disease. Thematic analysis was used to inductively co-construct themes through the lens of the biopsychosocial model.  Results:   Mental wellbeing was strongly affected in our participants due to the overwhelming emotional impact of their diagnosis resulting in an 'Emotional Diagnostic Disequilibrium'. Informational awareness and education about prostate cancer helped patients with 'Recognition of the Impact'. Patients experienced an 'Unsettling Monitoring Cycle' due to the increased fear and anxiety around PSA monitoring appointments, with some men ignoring their mental wellbeing needs as their disease is 'A Future Problem'. 'Concealment of Diagnosis' left many feeling isolated and highlighted an important coping mechanisms in the 'Importance of a Social Support Network' theme. Finally, physical health mostly changed through alterations in health behaviour, leading to 'A Healthier Lifestyle' with increasing attribution of physical symptoms to age through 'Symptomatic Overshadowing'.  Conclusion:   The greatest disease impact on men's wellbeing was at the time of diagnosis, with a subsequent cyclical anxiety and fear of disease progression prominent around monitoring appointments. Future research should explore ways to better support patients with these issues and at these times, improving their quality of life.""","""['Omar Eymech#', 'Oliver Brunckhorst#', 'Louis Fox', 'Anam Jawaid', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Robert Stewart', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Kamran Ahmed']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""[""Undergoing radical treatment for prostate cancer and its impact on wellbeing: A qualitative study exploring men's experiences."", 'Symptom experiences of older adults during treatment for metastatic prostate cancer: A qualitative investigation.', 'Perceptions of wellbeing and quality of life following participation in a community-based pre-operative exercise programme in men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer: A qualitative pilot study.', 'Patient reported factors influencing the decision-making process of men with localised prostate cancer when considering Active Surveillance-A systematic review and thematic synthesis.', 'Fear of cancer recurrence and PSA anxiety in patients with prostate cancer: a systematic review.', ""Cross-cultural differences in men on active surveillance' anxiety: a longitudinal comparison between Italian and Dutch patients from the Prostate cancer Research International Active Surveillance study.""]"""

This cross-sectional study evaluated the association between several simplistic techniques for assessing muscle mass and function with a more complex standard of reference for muscle wasting among Mexican men with prostate cancer. Muscle wasting was highly prevalent, yet it was presumably associated with aging rather than cancer and its treatment itself. The restricted availability of specific equipment in clinical settings with technological limitations supports using unsophisticated techniques as surrogate measurements for muscle wasting. The left-arm handgrip dynamometry displayed the highest correlation with the standard of reference and exhibited an acceptable predicted probability for muscle estimation. Combining several simplistic techniques may be preferable.

Previous studies have established that AR, TP53, RB1 and PTEN gene alterations are frequent at this stage of progression and that TP53, RB1 and PTEN, but not AR alterations are associated with poor outcome. However, the clonal dynamics of these key driver cancer genes during chemotherapy in mCRPC patients have not been described. Toward this goal, we performed a retrospective analysis of serially profiled cell-free DNA (cfDNA) alterations in blood samples collected from mCRPC patients before and after starting chemotherapy who were followed for response and clinical outcomes. While AR alterations and measures of mutational load were significantly reduced in patients with stable or decreased PSA levels after 3 cycles of chemotherapy, reductions in RB1, TP53 and PTEN alterations were relatively modest, which may represent the persistence of a clonal signature associated with the emergence of treatment-induced lineage plasticity (TILP) underlying resistance.

However, there is limited prospective evidence regarding its impact on the efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Objective:   To evaluate metastasis-free survival (MFS) and toxicity after SBRT to dual-tracer PET/CT-detected metastases in patients with nmPCa and early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; PSA ≤2 ng/ml).  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were prospectively screened using dual-tracer PET/CT between April 2019 and October 2020. SBRT was recommended for patients with five or fewer nonvisceral metastases (SBRT group). Patients without detectable metastases (N-/M- group) and those who refused SBRT (ADT group) continued to receive ADT. Patients were followed with conventional imaging.  Intervention:   SBRT to each PET/CT-detected metastasis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine MFS. Toxicity was evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event v4.0.  Results and limitations:   Seventy-four consecutive patients were screened. The median PSA and PSA doubling time were 0.59 ng/ml and 4.56 mo, respectively. Overall, 54 patients had metastases and 17 had PSMA-/FDG+ disease. Seven patients were excluded from the MFS analysis, including two with a history of abiraterone treatment and five with more than five metastases. The median follow-up was 21.4 mo. The ADT group had shorter MFS than the SBRT group (11.0 mo vs not reached; hazard ratio [HR] 4.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.92-25.0; p < 0.001) and the N-/M- group (11.0 mo vs not reached; HR 8.78, 95% CI 4.04-40.30; p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in median MFS between the SBRT group and the N-/M- group (p = 0.261). A PSA response >90% was achieved by 86% of patients in the SBRT group. There were no grade ≥3 adverse events after SBRT. The nonrandomized design is the major study limitation.  Conclusions:   Dual-tracer PET/CT-guided SBRT delivered superior local control rates in comparison to ADT alone and had minimal toxicity.

Materials/methods:   From a prospectively gathered institutional database, we identified patients with pN + M0 prostate cancer after surgery. We evaluated several regression models of known or suspected clinical-pathologic covariates and selected the model with the highest Harrell's concordance-index (c-index) and clinical utility to prognosticate metastasis for inclusion in a nomogram. Covariates in the final, competing-risk adjusted, metastasis model included PSA nadir after surgery, pathologic T-stage, margin status, Gleason score (GS), number of positive lymph nodes, and use of postoperative radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (RT + ADT). The overall survival model also included Charlson comorbidity score and age.  Results:   336 pN + men with a mean age of 64.9 years and a median follow-up of 4.1 years who had a radical prostatectomy were included in the analysis. 83 men were recommended RT + ADT, of whom 4% refused the ADT and received RT alone. C-index was 0.85 and 0.71 for the MFS and OS models, respectively. On multivariable analysis (MVA) adjusted for competing risks, RT + ADT significantly improved MFS (HR=0.70 P = < .01) with number of nodes positive, GS 8-10, PSA nadir > 1 ng/mL, and pT3b prognostic for metastasis. MVA for OS demonstrates RT+ADT improves survival (HR=0.40, P = .02), with GS8-10 and PSA nadir > 1.0 prognostic for death.

However, several randomized controlled trials have not shown the superiority of hypofractionated radiotherapy over conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Besides, in vivo and in vitro experimental results show that the linear-quadratic (LQ) model may not be appropriate for hypofractionated radiotherapy, and we guess it may be due to the influence of fractionation schedules on the α/β ratio. Therefore, this study attempted to estimate the α/β ratio in different fractionation schedules and evaluate the applicability of the LQ model in hypofractionated radiotherapy.  Methods:   The maximum likelihood principle in mathematical statistics was used to fit the parameters: α and β values in the tumor control probability (TCP) formula derived from the LQ model. In addition, the fitting results were substituted into the original TCP formula to calculate 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival for further verification.  Results:   Information necessary for fitting could be extracted from a total of 23,281 PCa patients. A total of 16,442 PCa patients were grouped according to fractionation schedules. We found that, for patients who received conventionally fractionated radiotherapy, moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy, the average α/β ratios were 1.78 Gy (95% CI 1.59-1.98), 3.46 Gy (95% CI 3.27-3.65), and 4.24 Gy (95% CI 4.10-4.39), respectively. Hence, the calculated α/β ratios for PCa tended to become higher when the dose per fraction increased. Among all PCa patients, 14,641 could be grouped according to the risks of PCa in patients receiving radiotherapy with different fractionation schedules. The results showed that as the risk increased, the k (natural logarithm of an effective target cell number) and α values decreased, indicating that the number of effective target cells decreased and the radioresistance increased.  Conclusions:   The LQ model appeared to be inappropriate for high doses per fraction owing to α/β ratios tending to become higher when the dose per fraction increased. Therefore, to convert the conventionally fractionated radiation doses to equivalent high doses per fraction using the standard LQ model, a higher α/β ratio should be used for calculation.""","""['Ming Cui', 'Xian-Shu Gao#', 'Xiaoying Li', 'Mingwei Ma', 'Xin Qi', 'Yuta Shibamoto#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['The minimal FLASH sparing effect needed to compensate the increase of radiobiological damage due to hypofractionation for late-reacting tissues.', 'Intensity-modulated fractionated radiotherapy versus stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PACE-B): acute toxicity findings from an international, randomised, open-label, phase 3, non-inferiority trial.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: 5-year outcomes of the HYPO-RT-PC randomised, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'The alfa and beta of tumours: a review of parameters of the linear-quadratic model, derived from clinical radiotherapy studies.', 'Systematic review of hypofractionated radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Invalidity of, and alternative to, the linear quadratic model as a predictive model for postirradiation cell survival.', 'Comparison of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with the 5-field technique, helical tomotherapy and volumetric modulated arc therapy for localized prostate cancer.']"""

We performed a meta-analysis and a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to evaluate the relationship and causality between schizophrenia and the risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   A comprehensive and systematic search of cohort studies was conducted, and a random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to calculate the standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for prostate cancer incidence among schizophrenia patients versus the general population. To investigate the correlation between genetically-predicted schizophrenia and prostate cancer risk, we used summary statistics from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium (61,106 controls and 79,148 cases), and 75 schizophrenia-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from European descent as the instrumental variable.  Results:   In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies with 218,076 men involved, a decreased risk of prostate cancer was observed among schizophrenia patients [SIR 0.610; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.500-0.740; p < 0.001] with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 83.3%; p < 0.001).

The result was robust against extensive sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   Our study indicated a decreased risk of prostate cancer in schizophrenia patients through meta-analysis, while MR analysis did not support the connection between schizophrenia and prostate cancer.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as key posttranscriptional modulators in diverse cancers. Herein, we purposed to explore the impacts of miR-363-3p on PCa growth, migration, infiltration along with apoptosis.  Methods:   The expressions of miR-363-3p along with Dickkopf 3 (DKK3) were assessed in clinical PCa specimens. We adopted the PCa cell line PC3 and transfected it using miR-363-3p repressors or mimic. The relationship of miR-363-3p with DKK3 was verified by a luciferase enzyme reporter assay. Cell viability along with apoptosis were determined by MTT assay coupled with flow cytometry analysis. Cell migration along infiltration were detected via wound healing, as well as Transwell assays. The contents of DKK3, E-cadherin, vimentin along with N-cadherin were analyzed via Western blotting accompanied with qRT-PCR.  Results:   MiR-363-3p was found to be inversely associated with the content of DKK3 in clinical PCa specimens. Further investigations revealed that DKK3 was miR-363-3p's direct target. Besides, overexpression of miR-363-3p decreased the contents of DKK3, promoted cell viability, migration coupled with infiltration, and reduced cell apoptosis, while silencing of miR-363-3p resulted in opposite influence. Upregulation of miR-363-3p diminished E-cadherin contents but increased vimentin along with N-cadherin protein contents in PC3 cells; in contrast, miR-363-3p downregulation produced the opposite result.

This study focused on the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is known to act as an antitumourigenic in several cancer cell lines. Though a genome-wide downregulation of proto-oncogenes in prostate cancer cell lines treated with SAM is obvious, the anticancer effects remain elusive. Thus, in this study, the impact of SAM treatment on the cell cycle, apoptosis and cancer-related pathways was investigated.  Methods and results:   After performing SAM treatment on prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and DU145), a cell-cycle arrest during the S-phase, a downregulation of cyclin A protein levels and an upregulation of p21 cell cycle inhibitor were observed. The proapoptotic Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and the caspase-3 activity were elevated; additionally, the apoptosis rate of SAM treated cells increased significantly in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, immunoblots displayed a downregulation of Erk1/2 and STAT3 phosphorylation accompanied by a reduced expression of the STAT3 protein.

Methods:   Among 495 patients with positive lymph nodes who consecutively underwent radical prostatectomy between 2007 and 2017, we investigated 347 patients who were recommended to undergo adjuvant radiotherapy by a multidisciplinary post-therapeutic tumor board and in whom information whether such treatment was eventually given was available. The median follow-up for censored patients was 5.4 years. Univariate analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, Mantel-Haenszel hazard ratios and log rank tests. Proportional hazard models for competing risks were used for multivariable analyses.  Results:   Adjuvant radiotherapy was independently associated with lower overall mortality and in high-risk patients (Gleason score 8-10 or three or more involved lymph nodes) also with lower prostate cancer-specific mortality. In patients with a Gleason score of 8-10 or three or more involved lymph nodes, the hazard ratio for adjuvant radiotherapy was 0.455 (95% confidence interval 0.257-0.806, p = 0.0069) for overall and 0.426 (95% confidence interval 0.201-0.902, p = 0.0259) for prostate cancer-specific mortality. Among patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, there was a trend to lower mortality when such treatment was combined with adjuvant androgen deprivation.  Conclusion:   Adjuvant radiotherapy decreased mortality in patients with positive lymph nodes at radical prostatectomy with further disease factors but not in patients with low-risk disease. Simultaneous androgen deprivation might increase efficacy.

They are also used as food additives (preservatives) in processed meats. They could play a role in the carcinogenicity of processed meat. The objective was to investigate the relationship between nitrate and nitrite intakes (natural food, water and food additive sources) and cancer risk in a large prospective cohort with detailed dietary assessment.  Methods:   Overall, 101 056 adults from the French NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-ongoing, median follow-up 6.7 years) were included. Nitrites/nitrates exposure was evaluated using repeated 24-h dietary records, linked to a comprehensive composition database and accounting for commercial names/brands of industrial products. Associations with cancer risk were assessed using multi-adjusted Cox hazard models.  Results:   In total, 3311 incident cancer cases were diagnosed. Compared with non-consumers, high consumers of food additive nitrates had higher breast cancer risk [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.24 (95% CI 1.03-1.48), P = 0.02], more specifically for potassium nitrate. High consumers of food additive nitrites had higher prostate cancer risk [HR = 1.58 (1.14-2.18), P = 0.008], specifically for sodium nitrite. Although similar HRs were observed for colorectal cancer for additive nitrites [HR = 1.22 (0.85-1.75)] and nitrates [HR = 1.26 (0.90-1.76)], no association was detected, maybe due to limited statistical power for this cancer location. No association was observed for natural sources.  Conclusion:   Food additive nitrates and nitrites were positively associated with breast and prostate cancer risks, respectively.

Acquired resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy represents a major impediment to durable clinical response. Understanding resistance mechanisms, including the role of AR expressed in other cell types within the tumor microenvironment, will extend the clinical benefit of AR-targeted therapy. Here, we show the ASI enzalutamide induces vascular catastrophe and promotes hypoxia and microenvironment adaptation. We characterize treatment-induced hypoxia, and subsequent induction of angiogenesis, as novel mechanisms of relapse to enzalutamide, highlighting the importance of two hypoxia-regulated cytokines in underpinning relapse. We confirmed AR expression in CD34+ vascular endothelium of biopsy tissue and human vascular endothelial cells (HVEC). Enzalutamide attenuated angiogenic tubule formation and induced cytotoxicity in HVECs in vitro, and rapidly induced sustained hypoxia in LNCaP xenografts. Subsequent reoxygenation, following prolonged enzalutamide treatment, was associated with increased tumor vessel density and accelerated tumor growth. Hypoxia increased AR expression and transcriptional activity in prostate cells in vitro. Coinhibition of IL8 and VEGF-A restored tumor response in the presence of enzalutamide, confirming the functional importance of their elevated expression in enzalutamide-resistant models. Moreover, coinhibition of IL8 and VEGF-A resulted in a durable, effective resolution of enzalutamide-sensitive prostate tumors. We conclude that concurrent inhibition of two hypoxia-induced factors, IL8 and VEGF-A, prolongs tumor sensitivity to enzalutamide in preclinical models and may delay the onset of enzalutamide resistance.

Theaflavin-3,3'-digallate (TF-3) is an important functional ingredient of black tea. We aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of TF-3 on prostate cancer and to identify the underlying molecular mechanism. In this study, we explored the effects of TF-3 on prostate cancer in PC-3 cells and in NOD/SCID mice with prostate cancer. The results demonstrated that TF-3 inhibited prostate cancer cell proliferation by regulating the PKCδ/aSMase signaling pathway. The anti-prostate cancer effect of TF-3 was attributed to the expression of the 67 kDa laminin receptor (67LR), which is overexpressed in various cancers, playing a vital role in the growth and metastasis of tumor cells. Stable knockdown of 67LR could efficiently inhibit TF-3 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in PC-3 cells, through interacting with the PKCδ/aSMase signaling pathway. In vivo studies also confirmed the above findings that TF-3 effectively inhibited tumor growth in terms of tumor volume. TF-3 treatment can significantly inhibit tumor growth and up-regulate the phosphorylation of PKCδ and the expression of aSMase in tumor xenografts developed by subcutaneously implanting PC-3 cells and 67LR-overexpressing PC-3 cells in mice.

The aim of this post hoc analysis of the PRIMARY study was to evaluate the clinical significance of patterns of intraprostatic PSMA activity, proposing a 5-point PRIMARY score to optimize the accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for csPCa in a low-prevalence population. Methods: The PRIMARY trial was a prospective multicenter phase II imaging trial that enrolled men with suspected PCa, no prior biopsy, and a recent mpMRI examination (6 mo) and for whom prostate biopsy was planned. In total, 291 men underwent mpMRI, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, and systematic biopsy with or without targeted biopsy. The mpMRI was read separately using the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) (version 2). 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT (pelvis only) was acquired a minimum of 60 min after injection. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was centrally read for pattern (diffuse transition zone [TZ], symmetric central zone [CZ], focal TZ, or focal peripheral zone [PZ]) and intensity (SUVmax). In this post hoc analysis, a 5-level PRIMARY score was assigned on the basis of analysis of the central read: no pattern (score of 1), diffuse TZ or CZ (not focal) (score of 2), focal TZ (score of 3), focal PZ (score of 4), or an SUVmax of at least 12 (score of 5). Two further readers independently assigned a PRIMARY score to 118 scans to determine interrater agreement.

However, as it is not always possible to apply the reference standard on the whole population under study, verification bias is introduced. Statistical methods exist to adjust estimates to account for this bias. We extend common methods to adjust for verification bias when multiple tests are compared to a reference standard using data from a prospective double blind screening study for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Begg and Greenes method and multiple imputation are extended to include the results of multiple screening tests which determine condition verification status. These two methods are compared to the complete case analysis using the IP1-PROSTAGRAM study data. IP1-PROSTAGRAM used a paired-cohort double-blind design to evaluate the use of imaging as alternative tests to screen for prostate cancer, compared to a blood test called prostate specific antigen (PSA). Participants with positive imaging (index) and/or PSA (control) underwent a prostate biopsy (reference standard).  Results:   When comparing complete case results to Begg and Greenes and methods of multiple imputation there is a statistically significant increase in the specificity estimates for all screening tests. Sensitivity estimates remained similar across the methods, with completely overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Negative predictive value (NPV) estimates were higher when adjusting for verification bias, compared to complete case analysis, even though the 95% confidence intervals overlap. Positive predictive value (PPV) estimates were similar across all methods.  Conclusion:   Statistical methods are required to adjust for verification bias in accuracy estimates of screening tests. Expanding Begg and Greenes method to include multiple screening tests can be computationally intensive, hence multiple imputation is recommended, especially as it can be modified for low prevalence of the target condition.""","""['Emily Day', 'David Eldred-Evans', 'A Toby Prevost', 'Hashim U Ahmed', 'Francesca Fiorentino']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['An Evaluation of Screening Pathways Using a Combination of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Prostate-specific Antigen: Results from the IP1-PROSTAGRAM Study.', 'Multiple imputation to correct for partial verification bias revisited.', 'Perceived patient burden and acceptability of MRI in comparison to PSA and ultrasound: results from the IP1-PROSTAGRAM study.', 'Screening for High Blood Pressure in Adults: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Correcting for partial verification bias in diagnostic accuracy studies: A tutorial using R.', 'Prostate cancer screening-stepping forward with MRI.', 'Partial Verification Bias Correction Using Inverse Probability Bootstrap Sampling for Binary Diagnostic Tests.']"""

We will highlight cancers that originate in organs surrounded by smooth muscle, which presents a barrier to dissemination, including prostate, bladder, esophageal, gastric, and colorectal cancers. We propose that the heterogeneity of cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion receptors is an important driver of aggressive tumor networks with functional consequences for progression. Phenotype heterogeneity of the tumor provides a biophysical advantage for tumor network invasion through the tensile muscle and survival of the tumor network. We hypothesize that a functional epithelial-mesenchymal cooperation (EMC)exists within the tumor invasive network to facilitate tumor escape from the primary organ, invasion and traversing of muscle, and navigation to metastatic sites. Cooperation between specific epithelial cells within the tumor and stromal (mesenchymal) cells interacting with the tumor is illustrated using the examples of laminin-binding adhesion molecules-especially integrins-and their response to growth and inflammatory factors in the tumor microenvironment. The cooperation between cell-cell (E-cadherin, CDH1) and cell-ECM (α6 integrin, CD49f) expression and growth factor receptors is highlighted within poorly differentiated human tumors associated with aggressive disease. Cancer-associated fibroblasts are examined for their role in the tumor microenvironment in generating and organizing various growth factors. Cellular structural proteins are potential utility markers for future spatial profiling studies. We also examine the special characteristics of the smooth muscle microenvironment and how invasion by a primary tumor can alter this environment and contribute to tumor escape via cooperation between epithelial and stromal cells. This cooperative state allows the heterogenous tumor clusters to be shaped by various growth factors, co-opt or evade immune system response, adapt from hypoxic to normoxic conditions, adjust to varying energy sources, and survive radiation and chemotherapeutic interventions. Understanding the epithelial-mesenchymal cooperation in early tumor invasive networks holds potential for both identifying early biomarkers of the aggressive transition and identification of novel agents to prevent the epithelial-mesenchymal cooperation phenotype. Epithelial-mesenchymal cooperation is likely to unveil new tumor subtypes to aid in selection of appropriate therapeutic strategies.""","""['William L Harryman', 'Kendra D Marr', 'Ray B Nagle', 'Anne E Cress']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['The matrix environmental and cell mechanical properties regulate cell migration and contribute to the invasive phenotype of cancer cells.', 'Gene Editing of α6 Integrin Inhibits Muscle Invasive Networks and Increases Cell-Cell Biophysical Properties in Prostate Cancer.', 'HR+HER2- breast cancers with growth factor receptor-mediated EMT have a poor prognosis and lapatinib downregulates EMT in MCF-7 cells.', 'Identification of a new pro-invasion factor in tumor microenvironment: progress in function and mechanism of extracellular ATP.', 'Cell death under epithelial-mesenchymal transition control in prostate cancer therapeutic response.']"""

Results:   After a median follow-up of 41 months, 219 events occurred; the estimated 3-year BRFS was 79% and the 5-year BRFS was 70%. Increasing PSMA intensity was associated with less favourable BRFS overall (Log rank p < 0.001), and within subgroups of Gleason score category (Log rank p < 0.03). PSMA intensity was significantly associated with shorter time to biochemical recurrence, after adjusting for pre-operative (HR per 5-unit SUVmax increase = 1.15) and post-operative (HR per 5-unit SUVmax increase = 1.10) parameters.

Little is known about how the mental health of these men is treated.  Materials and methods:   We identified men with prostate cancer who received ADT between 2001 and 2015 using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database. We determined the incidence of depression or anxiety diagnoses, mental health treatments, and the specialty of providers initiating psychotropic medications, after the start of ADT. Outcomes were compared with those of men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT and men without prostate cancer.  Results:   Of 37 388 men with prostate cancer treated with ADT, 3964 (10.6%) received a new diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Of those 3964 men, 1892 (47.7%) did not receive a documented treatment, 10 (0.3%) received psychotherapy, 1321 (33.3%) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and 744 (18.8%) a benzodiazepine. The median time from initiation of ADT to a depression or anxiety diagnosis was 9.3 months. Primary care physicians were the most common prescribers of psychotropic medications (72.2%). The proportion of men not receiving mental health treatments of interest (47.7%) was similar compared to men without prostate cancer (49.1%), but statistically significantly lower compared to men with prostate cancer not receiving ADT (52.7%).

We investigated a mouse model of PC as well as specimens from PC patients to unravel an unsuspected contribution of thymus-derived T lymphocytes and the intestinal microbiota in the efficacy of ADT.  Methods:   Preclinical experiments were performed in PC-bearing mice, immunocompetent or immunodeficient. In parallel, we prospectively included 65 HSPC and CRPC patients (Oncobiotic trial) to analyze their feces and blood specimens.  Results:   In PC-bearing mice, ADT increased thymic cellularity and output. PC implanted in T lymphocyte-depleted or athymic mice responded less efficiently to ADT than in immunocompetent mice. Moreover, depletion of the intestinal microbiota by oral antibiotics reduced the efficacy of ADT. PC reduced the relative abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut, and this effect was reversed by ADT. Moreover, cohousing of PC-bearing mice with tumor-free mice or oral gavage with Akkermansia improved the efficacy of ADT. This appears to be applicable to PC patients because long-term ADT resulted in an increase of thymic output, as demonstrated by an increase in circulating recent thymic emigrant cells (sjTRECs). Moreover, as compared with HSPC controls, CRPC patients demonstrated a shift in their intestinal microbiota that significantly correlated with sjTRECs. While feces from healthy volunteers restored ADT efficacy, feces from PC patients failed to do so.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest the potential clinical utility of reversing intestinal dysbiosis and repairing acquired immune defects in PC patients.""","""['Safae Terrisse', 'Anne-Gaelle Goubet', 'Kousuke Ueda', 'Andrew Maltez Thomas', 'Valentin Quiniou', 'Cassandra Thelemaque', 'Garett Dunsmore', 'Emmanuel Clave', 'Melissa Gamat-Huber', 'Satoru Yonekura', 'Gladys Ferrere', 'Conrad Rauber', 'Hang Phuong Pham', 'Jean-Eudes Fahrner', 'Eugenie Pizzato', 'Pierre Ly', 'Marine Fidelle', 'Marine Mazzenga', 'Carolina Alves Costa Silva', 'Federica Armanini', 'Federica Pinto', 'Francesco Asnicar', 'Romain Daillère', 'Lisa Derosa', 'Corentin Richard', 'Pierre Blanchard', 'Bertrand Routy', 'Stéphane Culine', 'Paule Opolon', 'Aymeric Silvin', 'Florent Ginhoux', 'Antoine Toubert', 'Nicola Segata', 'Douglas G McNeel', 'Karim Fizazi#', 'Guido Kroemer#', 'Laurence Zitvogel#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Effects of the intestinal microbiota on prostate cancer treatment by androgen deprivation therapy.', 'RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'CaV1.3 enhanced store operated calcium promotes resistance to androgen deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Effects of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer on gut microbiota and treatment.', 'Bipolar Androgen Therapy for Men With Androgen Ablation Naïve Prostate Cancer: Results From the Phase II BATMAN Study.', 'Bacteria in cancer initiation, promotion and progression.', 'Gut OncoMicrobiome Signatures (GOMS) as next-generation biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Acute exercise induces distinct quantitative and phenotypical T cell profiles in men with prostate cancer.', 'Potential role of gut microbiota in prostate cancer: immunity, metabolites, pathways of action?', 'The human microbiome links to prostate cancer risk and treatment (Review).']"""

Using the Kampala Cancer Registry data, we projected incidence of top five cancers, namely, Kaposi sarcoma (KS), cervical, breast and prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in Uganda.  Design:   Trend analysis of cancer registry data.  Setting:   Kampala Cancer Registry, Uganda.  Main outcome measure:   Cancer incidence data from 2001 to 2015 were used and projected to 2030. Population data were obtained from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics. Age-standardised incidence rates (ASRs) and their trends over the observed and projected period were calculated. Percentage change in cancer incidence was calculated to determine whether cancer incidence changes were attributable to cancer risk changes or population changes.  Results:   It was projected that the incidence rates of KS and NHL continue to decrease by 22.6% and 37.3%, respectively. The ASR of KS was expected to decline from 29.6 per 100 000 population to 10.4, while ASR of NHL was expected to decrease from 7.6 to 3.2. In contrast, cervical, breast and prostate cancer incidence were projected to increase by 35.3%, 57.7% and 33.4%, respectively. The ASRs of cervical and breast were projected to increase up to 66.1 and 48.4 per 100 000 women. The ASR of prostate cancer was estimated to increase from 41.6 to 60.5 per 100 000 men. These changes were due to changes in risk factors and population growth.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest a rapid shift in the profile of common cancers in Uganda, reflecting a new trend emerging in low/middle-income countries. This change in cancer spectrum, from infection-related to lifestyle-related, yields another challenge to cancer control programmes in resource-limited countries. Forthcoming cancer control programmes should include a substantial focus on lifestyle-related cancers, while infectious disease control programmes should be maintained.""","""['Judith Asasira', 'Sanghee Lee', 'Thi Xuan Mai Tran', 'Collins Mpamani', 'Henry Wabinga', 'So-Youn Jung', 'Yoon Jung Chang', 'Yikyung Park', 'Hyunsoon Cho']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMJ Open""","""['Cancer in Kampala, Uganda, in 1989-91: changes in incidence in the era of AIDS.', 'Changing cancer incidence in Kampala, Uganda, 1991-2006.', 'Cancer incidence in Northern Uganda (2013-2016).', 'The Changing Global Burden of Cancer: Transitions in Human Development and Implications for Cancer Prevention and Control.', 'Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-associated cancers in Sub-Saharan Africa.', 'Treatment compliance among adult cervical cancer patients receiving care at Uganda cancer institute, Uganda: a retrospective data review.', 'Prevalence, trends and distribution of lifestyle cancer risk factors in Uganda: a 20-year systematic review.', 'Ethnobotanical Survey of Medicinal Plants Used in Breast Cancer Treatment by Traditional Health Practitioners in Central Uganda.', 'Uptake of prostate cancer screening and associated factors among men aged 50 years and above in Lira city, Uganda: a cross-sectional study.', 'Age and Cancer Incidence in 5.2 Million People With Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): The South African HIV Cancer Match Study.']"""

Image quality, lesion detection and characterization (biparametric PI-RADSv2.1) were evaluated by 2 independent observers. Estimated signal-to-noise ratio (eSNR) was measured in identified lesions and the peripheral zone (PZ). Patient comfort was assessed using a questionnaire. Data were compared between sequences and acquisitions. Inter/intra-observer agreement for PI-RADS scores was evaluated.  Results:   Twenty four prostate lesions (22 PCa) were identified in 20/33 men. Superior image quality was found for ERC-PAC compared to PAC for T2WI for one observer (Obs.1, p < 0.03) and high b-value DWI for both observers (p < 0.05).

Socioeconomic disadvantage and geographical remoteness have been shown to be related to worse oncologic outcomes, and it is expected that they would similarly influence functional outcomes in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using data from the Victorian Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry (n = 10,924), we investigated functional outcomes as measured by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26) following prostate cancer treatment, focusing on associations with socioeconomic status and geographical remoteness and controlling for clinicopathologic characteristics. A single composite score was developed from the five separate EPIC-26 domains for use in geo-mapping.  Results:   A total of 7690 patients had complete EPIC-26 data, allowing mapping hotspots of poor function using our composite score. These hotspots were observed to relate to areas of socioeconomic disadvantage. Significant heterogeneity in outcomes was seen in urban areas, with hotspots of good and poor function. Both socioeconomic disadvantage and geographical remoteness were found to predict for worse functional outcomes, although only the former is significant on multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   Geo-mapping of functional outcomes in prostate cancer has the potential to guide health care service provision and planning. A nuanced policy approach is required so as not to miss disadvantaged patients who live in urban areas. We have demonstrated the potential of geo-mapping to visualise population-level outcomes, potentially allowing targeted interventions to address inequities in quality of care.""","""['Kendrick Koo', 'Nathan Papa', 'Melanie Evans', 'Michael Jefford', 'Maarten IJzerman', 'Victoria White', 'Sue M Evans', 'Eli Ristevski', 'Jon Emery', 'Jeremy Millar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Geographic disparities in prostate cancer outcomes--review of international patterns.', 'Regional Variations in Quality of Survival Among Men with Prostate Cancer Across the United Kingdom.', 'Development and validation of an abbreviated version of the expanded prostate cancer index composite instrument for measuring health-related quality of life among prostate cancer survivors.', 'Health-related quality of life by human immunodeficiency virus status in a cross-sectional survey of gay and bisexual prostate cancer survivors.', 'Influence of deprivation and rurality on patient-reported outcomes of men living with and beyond prostate cancer diagnosis in the UK: A population-based study.', 'A Systematic Review of Areal Units and Adjacency Used in Bayesian Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Conditional Autoregressive Models in Health Research.']"""

Cancer cells typically exhibit much-facilitated growth that necessitates upregulated glycolysis and augmented amino acid metabolism, that of glutamine and aspartate in particular, which is tightly coupled with an increased flux of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Epidemiological studies have exploited metabolomics to explore the etiology and found potentially effective biomarkers for early detection or progression of prostate and breast cancers. However, large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to establish causal associations between amino acid metabolism and prostate and breast cancers have not been reported.  Objective:   Utilizing two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), we aimed to estimate how genetically predicted glutamate and aspartate levels could impact upon prostate and breast cancers development.  Methods:   Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as instrumental variables (IVs), associated with the serum levels of glutamate and aspartate were extracted from the publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWASs), which were conducted to associate genetic variations with blood metabolite levels using comprehensive metabolite profiling in 1,960 adults; and the glutamate and aspartate we have chosen were two of 644 metabolites. The summary statistics for the largest and latest GWAS datasets for prostate cancer (61,106 controls and 79,148 cases) were from the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL) consortium, and datasets for breast cancer (113,789 controls and 133,384 cases) were from Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). The study was performed through two-sample MR method.  Results:   Causal estimates were expressed as odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) per standard deviation increment in serum level of aspartate or glutamate. Aspartate was positively associated with prostate cancer (Effect = 1.043; 95% confidence interval, 1.003 to 1.084; P = 0.034) and breast cancer (Effect = 1.033; 95% confidence interval, 1.004 to 1.063; P = 0.028); however, glutamate was neither associated with prostate cancer nor with breast cancer. The potential causal associations were robust to the sensitivity analysis.  Conclusions:   Our study found that the level of serum aspartate could serve as a risk factor that contributed to the development of prostate and breast cancers. Efforts on a detailed description of the underlying biochemical mechanisms would be extremely valuable in early assessment and/or diagnosis, and strategizing clinical intervention, of both cancers.""","""['Yindan Lin#', 'Ze Yang#', 'Jingjia Li#', 'Yandi Sun', 'Xueyun Zhang', 'Zihao Qu', 'Yan Luo', 'Lihong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Genomics""","""['Circulating phosphorus concentration and risk of prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Association between serum uric acid and prostate cancer risk in East Asian populations: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Mendelian randomization study of adiposity-related traits and risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, lung and colorectal cancer.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Metabolomics of Breast Cancer: A Review.', 'Changes in the survival of patients with breast cancer: Poland, 2000-2019.', 'Dual Effect of Tryptamine on Prostate Cancer Cell Growth Regulation: A Pilot Study.']"""

Live cells are often encapsulated into the biomaterials (i.e., bio-ink) and extruded by controlling the printing parameters. The functionality of the bioink depends upon three factors: (a) printability, (b) shape fidelity, and (c) bio-compatibility. Increasing viscosity will improve the printability and the shape fidelity but require higher applied extrusion pressure, which is detrimental to the living cell dwelling in the bio-ink, which is often ignored in the bio-ink optimization process. This paper demonstrates a roadmap to develop and optimize bio-inks, ensuring printability, shape fidelity, and cell survivability. The pressure exerted on the bio-ink during extrusion processes is measured analytically, and the information is incorporated in the bio-ink's rheology design. Cell-laden filaments are fabricated with multiple cell lines, i.e., Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK 293), BxPC3, and prostate cancer cells which are analyzed for cell viability. The cross-sectional live-dead assay of the extruded filament demonstrates a spatial pattern for HEK 293 cell viability, which correlates with our analytical finding of the shear stress at the nozzle tip. All three cell lines were able to sustain a transient shear stress of 3.7 kPa and demonstrate 90% viability with our designed bio-ink after 15 days of incubation. Simultaneously, the shape fidelity and printability matrices show its suitability for 3D bio-printing process.""","""['Md Ahasan Habib', 'Bashir Khoda']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Manuf Process""","""['Digestion degree is a key factor to regulate the printability of pure tendon decellularized extracellular matrix bio-ink in extrusion-based 3D cell printing.', 'Effect of bioink properties on printability and cell viability for 3D bioplotting of embryonic stem cells.', 'Printability and bio-functionality of a shear thinning methacrylated xanthan-gelatin composite bioink.', 'Printability and Shape Fidelity of Bioinks in 3D Bioprinting.', 'Natural Hydrogel-Based Bio-Inks for 3D Bioprinting in Tissue Engineering: A Review.', 'Three-dimensional bioprinting of artificial blood vessel: Process, bioinks, and challenges.', '3D Bioprinting Strategies for Articular Cartilage Tissue Engineering.', 'Development of Polyurethane/Peptide-Based Carriers with Self-Healing Properties.', 'Rheology as a Tool for Fine-Tuning the Properties of Printable Bioinspired Gels.', 'Effect of sterilization processes on alginate/gelatin inks for three-dimensional printing.']"""

ADT alters testosterone levels via its action on the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis and may influence hypothalamic functions. Given the wide regional connectivity of the hypothalamus and its role in regulating cognition and behavior, we assessed the effects of ADT on hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) and their cognitive and clinical correlates.  Methods:   In a prospective observational study, 22 men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT and 28 patients not receiving ADT (controls), matched in age, years of education, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, participated in N-back task and quality of life (QoL) assessments and brain imaging at baseline and at 6 months. Imaging data were processed with published routines and the results of a group by time flexible factorial analysis were evaluated at a corrected threshold.  Results:   ADT and control groups did not differ in N-back performance or QoL across time points. Relative to controls, patients receiving ADT showed significantly higher hypothalamus-right mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) and precentral gyrus (PCG) rsFC during follow-up versus baseline. Further, the changes in MCC and PCG rsFC were correlated positively with the change in QoL score and 0-back correct response rate, respectively, in patients with undergoing ADT.  Conclusion:   Six-month ADT affects hypothalamic functional connectivity with brain regions critical to cognitive motor and affective functions. Elevated hypothalamic MCC and PCG connectivity likely serve to functionally compensate for the effects of ADT and sustain attention and overall QoL.

Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) are promising non‑immunoglobulin‑based scaffold proteins for payload delivery to cancer‑associated molecular targets. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is overexpressed in 40‑60% of prostate cancers (PCs) and is associated with metastasis, increased risk of PC recurrence and resistance to treatment. Here, we investigated the use of DARPin Ec1 for targeted delivery of Pseudomonas exotoxin A variant (LoPE) with low immunogenicity and low non‑specific toxicity to EpCAM‑expressing prostate cancer cells. Ec1‑LoPE fusion protein was radiolabeled with tricarbonyl technetium‑99m and its binding specificity, binding kinetics, cellular processing, internalization and cytotoxicity were evaluated in PC‑3 and DU145 cell lines. Ec1‑LoPE showed EpCAM‑specific binding to EpCAM‑expressing prostate cancer cells. Rapid internalization mediated potent cytotoxic effect with picomolar IC50 values in both studied cell lines. Taken together, these data support further evaluation of Ec1‑LoPE in a therapeutic setting in a prostate cancer model in vivo.""","""['Tianqi Xu', 'Yongsheng Liu', 'Alexey Schulga', 'Elena Konovalova', 'Sergey M Deyev', 'Vladimir Tolmachev', 'Anzhelika Vorobyeva']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Feasibility of Co-Targeting HER3 and EpCAM Using Seribantumab and DARPin-Toxin Fusion in a Pancreatic Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'Assessing the use of tumor-specific DARPin-toxin fusion proteins for ex\xa0vivo purging of cancer metastases from human ovarian cortex before autotransplantation.', 'Effect of a radiolabel biochemical nature on tumor-targeting properties of EpCAM-binding engineered scaffold protein DARPin Ec1.', 'Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins: A New Class of Viral Entry Inhibitors.', 'Recent Advances on Affibody- and DARPin-Conjugated Nanomaterials in Cancer Therapy.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.', 'Feasibility of Co-Targeting HER3 and EpCAM Using Seribantumab and DARPin-Toxin Fusion in a Pancreatic Cancer Xenograft Model.', 'Experimental HER2-Targeted Therapy Using ADAPT6-ABD-mcDM1 in Mice Bearing SKOV3 Ovarian Cancer Xenografts: Efficacy and Selection of Companion Imaging Counterpart.']"""

Ten PPSRCC patients diagnosed at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from November 2014 to December 2020 were included. Clinical characteristics, image features, therapeutic procedures, histological diagnosis, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. All patients received prostate-specific antigen (PSA) examination preoperatively. Nine of them accepted multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) due to elevated PSA value, and further biopsied. Among them, five patients were diagnosed as prostatic adenocarcinoma and the other four cases were found a mixture of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) and adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, gastrointestinal endoscope and abdominal computed tomography (CT) did not find SRCC originating in gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, these cases were considered to be PPSRCC. Nine patients accepted laparoscopic or robot-assisted RP. Only one patient with normal PSA adopted transurethral resection of the prostate. Postoperative pathological results confirmed SRCC mixed with prostatic adenocarcinoma in nine cases, and only one patient with pure SRCC. After surgery, nine patients received adjuvant hormone therapy, one of which accepted radiotherapy simultaneously. The patient with pure SRCC did not accept any adjuvant therapy postoperatively. During a mean follow-up of 31.9 months, only four patients were alive without disease progression. In summary, PPSRCC is a rare malignant tumor with few specific symptoms, rapid disease progression, and poor prognosis and is frequently accompanied by high-grade prostate adenocarcinoma patterns.

There is a well-documented association between PC and metabolic health. Impaired metabolic health is a significant risk factor for the development of PC, and a metabolic syndrome can be induced by hormonal therapies commonly required for its management. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292041).  Methods:   We introduced a periodic 4-day FMD -low in calories, sugars, and proteins but high in unsaturated fats -to a cohort of PC patients and features of metabolic syndrome. 29/35 patients completed 3-monthly cycles of the 4-consecutive day packaged FMD. We compared the subjects' baseline weight, abdominal circumference (AC), blood pressure (BP) and selected laboratory results to the same measurements 3-months after completing the FMD cycles.  Results:   Several important metabolic factors showed improvements post-intervention. On average patients' weights dropped by 3.79 kg (95% CI: -5.61, -1.97, p = 0.0002). AC was reduced on average by 4.57 cm, (95% CI: -2.27, -6.87, p = 0.0003). There was also a decrease in systolic and diastolic BP by 9.52 mmHg (95% CI: -16.16, -2.88, p = 0.0066) and 4.48 mmHg (95% CI: -8.85, -0.43, p = 0.0316) respectively. A sub-analysis indicates that FMD had more relevant effects in 'at-risk' patients than those with normal values of risk factors for metabolic syndrome. For example, subjects with baseline levels of systolic BP > 130 mmHg experienced a greater reduction in BP(-16.04 mmHg, p = 0.0001) than those with baseline systolic BP < 130 mmHg (-0.78 mmHg, p = 0.89).  Conclusions:   The FMD cycles were safely introduced to this small cohort of PC patients with little or no observed toxicity, and a high overall compliance of 83%. Analysis of the metabolic variables showed an overall decrease in weight, AC, and BP. Larger clinical trials focused on metabolic risk factors, PC quality of life and progression free survival are needed to assess the effect of the FMD on prostate cancer patients.""","""['V Fay-Watt', ""S O'Connor"", 'D Roshan', 'A C Romeo', 'V D Longo#', 'F J Sullivan#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Correction: The impact of a fasting mimicking diet on the metabolic health of a prospective cohort of patients with prostate cancer: a pilot implementation study.', 'The effects of diet on prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Fasting-mimicking diet and markers/risk factors for aging, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.', 'Fasting in diabetes treatment (FIT) trial: study protocol for a randomised, controlled, assessor-blinded intervention trial on the effects of intermittent use of a fasting-mimicking diet in patients with type 2 diabetes.', 'Antihypertensive efficacy and safety of olmesartan medoxomil and ramipril in elderly mild to moderate essential hypertensive patients with or without metabolic syndrome: a pooled post hoc analysis of two comparative trials.', 'Behavioral Counseling to Promote a Healthful Diet and Physical Activity for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Adults Without Known Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: Updated Systematic Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Blood pressure-lowering efficacy of monotherapy with thiazide diuretics for primary hypertension.', ""The Potential of Fasting-Mimicking Diet as a Preventive and Curative Strategy for Alzheimer's Disease."", 'Intermittent fasting interventions to leverage metabolic and circadian mechanisms for cancer treatment and supportive care outcomes.', 'The Effects of a Fasting Mimicking Diet on Skin Hydration, Skin Texture, and Skin Assessment: A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'A healthy diet, a healthy prostate?

PHC is a basic package of services offered to local communities, serving as the first point of contact within the health system. These services are offered at clinics and community health centres (CHC), the latter providing additional maternity, accident and emergency services.  Design:   The retrospective descriptive study design was used.  Methods:   We analysed national laboratory data between 2006 and 2016 for men ≥30 years in the Gauteng Province. We used the probabilistic matching algorithm to create first-ever PSA cohort. We used the hot-deck imputation to assign missing race group values and the district health information system facility descriptors to identify PHC testing. We reported patient numbers by calendar year, age category and race group as well as descriptive statistics. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess any association for race group and age with a PSA ≥4 µg/L.  Results:   Between 2006 and 2016, numbers of men tested increased from 1782 to 67 025, respectively, with 186 984/239 506 (78.1%) tests were from clinics. The majority of testing was for men in the 50-59 age category (31.5%) and Black Africans (86.4%). We reported a median of 0.9 µg/L that increased with age. A PSA ≥4 µg/L was reported for 11.7% of men, increasing to 35.5% for the ≥70 age category. The logistic regression reported that the adjusted odds of having a PSA ≥4 µg/L was significantly lower for Indian/Asians, multiracials and whites than for Black Africans (p value<0.0001).

Materials and methods:   Data were obtained from four randomised controlled trials and a non-trial cohort from a tertiary cancer centre. The PSA kinetics covariates chosen were absolute value (PSAT), best percentage change (BPCH) and tumour growth rate (K). The association between the covariates collected and overall survival was assessed within a Cox proportional hazards model. How well a covariate captured the difference between trial and non-trial patients was assessed by reporting on models with or without trial status as a covariate.  Results:   We reviewed individual datasets of 2282 patients.

Of the time-dependent covariates, we found that BPCH best captured the difference between trial and non-trial patient prognosis.  Conclusions:   The analysis presented here highlights how data from open-source trial databases can be combined with emerging clinical practice databases to assess differences between trial versus non-trial patients for particular treatments.

Methods:   The expressions of STEAP1 between normal and tumor tissues were analyzed using TCGA and GTEx. Clinicopathologic data was collected from GEPIA and TCGA. Prognostic analysis was conducted by Cox proportional hazard regression and Kaplan-Meier survival. DNA methylation, mutation features, and molecular subtypes of cancers were also investigated. The top-100 coexpressed genes with STEAP1 were involved in functional enrichment analysis. ESTIMATE algorithm was used to analyze the correlation between STEAP1 and immunity value. The relationships of STEAP1 and biomarkers including tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and stemness score as well as chemosensitivity were also illustrated.  Results:   Among 33 cancers, STEAP1 was overexpressed in 19 cancers such as cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma (CESC), colon adenocarcinoma, and lymphoid neoplasm diffuse large B cell lymphoma while was downregulated in 5 cancers such as adrenocortical carcinoma, breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), and kidney chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. STEAP1 has significant prognostic relationships in multiple cancers. 15 cancers exhibited differences of DNA methylation including bladder urothelial carcinoma, BRCA, and CESC. STEAP1 expression was positively correlated to immune molecules especially in thyroid carcinoma and negatively especially in uveal melanoma. STEAP1 was associated with TMB and MSI in certain cancers. In addition, STEAP1 was connected with increased chemosensitivity of drugs such as trametinib and pimasertib.

Since high levels of kinesin Eg5 expression have been correlated with a poor prognosis in laryngeal carcinoma, we decided to test the anticancer activity of K858 toward this tumor, which belongs to the group of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). These cancers are characterized by low responsiveness to therapy. The effects of K858 on the proliferation and assembly of mitotic spindles of three human HNSCC cell lines were studied using cytotoxicity assays and immunofluorescence for tubulin. The effect of K858 on the cell cycle was analyzed by FACS. The expression levels of cyclin B1 and several markers of apoptosis and invasion were studied by Western blot. Finally, the negative regulation of the malignant phenotype by K858 was evaluated by an invasion assay. K858 inhibited cell replication by rendering cells incapable of developing normal bipolar mitotic spindles. At the same time, K858 blocked the cell cycle in the G2 phase and induced the accumulation of cytoplasmic cyclin B and, eventually, apoptosis.

Today's minimally invasive surgical procedures require miniaturization and surgical integration of highly sensitive imagers to seamlessly integrate into the modern clinical workflow. However, current intraoperative imagers remain cumbersome and still heavily dependent on large lenses and rigid filters, precluding further miniaturization and integration into surgical tools.  Procedures:   We have successfully engineered a chip-scale intraoperative micro-imager array-without optical filters or lenses-integrated with lanthanide-based alloyed upconverting nanoparticles (aUCNPs) to achieve tissue imaging using a single micro-chip. This imaging platform is able to leverage the unique optical properties of aUCNPs (long luminescent lifetime, high-efficiency upconversion, no photobleaching) by utilizing a time-resolved imaging method to acquire images using a 36-by-80-pixel, 2.3 mm [Formula: see text] 4.8 mm silicon-based electronic imager micro-chip, that is, less than 100-µm thin. Each pixel incorporates a novel architecture enabling automated background measurement and cancellation. We have validated the performance, spatial resolution, and the background cancellation scheme of the imaging platform, using resolution test targets and mouse prostate tumor sample intratumorally injected with aUCNPs. To demonstrate the ability to image MRD, or tumor margins, we evaluated the imaging platform in visualizing a single-cell thin section of the injected prostate tumor sample.  Results:   Tested on USAF resolution targets, the imager is able to achieve a resolution of 71 µm. We have also demonstrated successful background cancellation, achieving a signal-to-background ratio of 8 when performing ex vivo imaging on aUCNP-injected prostate tumor sample, improved from originally 0.4. The performance of the imaging platform on single-cell layer sections was also evaluated and the sensor achieved a signal-to-background ratio of 4.3 in resolving cell clusters with sizes as low as 200 cells.  Conclusion:   The imaging system proposed here is a scalable chip-scale ultra-thin alternative for bulky conventional intraoperative imagers. Its novel pixel architecture and background correction scheme enable visualization of microscopic-scale residual disease while remaining completely free of lenses and filters, achieving an ultra-miniaturized form factor-critical for intraoperative settings.""","""['Hossein Najafiaghdam', 'Cassio C S Pedroso', 'Nicole A Torquato', 'Bruce E Cohen', 'Mekhail Anwar']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Imaging Biol""","""['A 25 micron-thin microscope for imaging upconverting nanoparticles with NIR-I and NIR-II illumination.', 'Optics-Free Chip-Scale Intraoperative Imaging Using NIR-Excited Upconverting Nanoparticles.', 'A Molecular Imaging ""Skin A Time-resolving Intraoperative Imager for Microscopic Residual Cancer Detection Using Enhanced Upconverting Nanoparticles.', 'Optimizing brain tumor resection.

Subjects and methods:   In this Swedish nationwide cohort, PC diagnosis was followed for among 149,985 men with one FDR affected by PCa-1, 10,972 with one FDR affected by PCa-2 and 2,896,561 without any FDRs affected by cancer in a maximum of 57 years. PC patients were further followed for death due to PC since diagnosis. Relative risk (RR) of PC was estimated with Poisson regression and hazard ratio (HR) with Cox proportional hazard model.  Results:   Compared to men without any FDRs affected by cancer, the RRs of PC in men with one FDR affected by PCa-1 and PCa-2 were 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.07-2.17) and 1.69 (1.54-1.85), respectively. The risk in men with one FDR affected by PCa-2 was significantly lower than those with one FDR affected by PCa-1 after additionally adjusting for family relationship (father-son and brothers) and age at diagnosis of PC in FDR (RR PCa-2 vs PCa-1 , 0.85, 95% CI, 0.78-0.94). PC patients with a family history of PCa-2 were more likely to be detected at late-stage and less likely to be diagnosed by screening, compared to those with a family history of PCa-1. Patients whose PC was diagnosed after the diagnosis of PCa-1 in FDRs had a better survival than those without a family history of cancer (HR, 0.88, 95% CI, 0.80-0.97), but no such association was observed among patients with a family history of PCa-2.

Although the benefits and barriers to using web-based resources for cancer patients are well-documented, less research has focused on the personal characteristics important for efficient tailoring and targeting of information that are associated with usage.  Objective:   We used the Cognitive-Social Health Information Processing (C-SHIP) framework to guide our exploration of personal characteristics associated with use of PROGRESS, an informational PC survivorship website that addresses physical, emotional, interpersonal, and practical concerns relevant for PC survivors.  Methods:   PC survivors (N=217) were randomized to the intervention arm (PROGRESS) of a randomized controlled trial. Of those randomized to the intervention arm, 84 used PROGRESS, and 133 did not use PROGRESS. Multivariable analyses evaluated demographic and psychosocial characteristics (eg, style of coping, health literacy, self-efficacy, affective states of depression, anxiety, and fatigue) associated with website use.  Results:   A larger proportion of non-Hispanic White (68/160, 42.5%), compared with non-Hispanic Black (9/40, 23%), participants used PROGRESS (P<.001). Further, PROGRESS users were older in age (P<.001), had a monitoring style of coping (P=.01), and were less depressed (P=.004), anxious (P=.02), and fatigued (P<.001) than nonusers. Education, income, health literacy, blunting style of coping, self-efficacy, and treatment type (radiation therapy or surgery) were not significantly related to use. On multivariable analyses, race (OR 0.28, P<.001), age (OR 1.05, P<.001), monitoring style of coping (OR 1.27, P=.02), and overall mood (OR 0.98, P<.001) remained significant.  Conclusions:   A combination of monitoring and low levels of negative affect were associated with website use. Additionally, users were older, non-Hispanic White survivors.

Solamargine, a natural alkaloid isolated from a traditional Chinese herbal medicine known as Solanum nigrum, exhibits antitumor activity in various human cancers. In this study, we demonstrated that solamargine substantially inhibited CRPC cell growth in a dose-dependent manner through the suppression of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling.

In addition, a chaotic invasive weed optimization (CIWO) based feature selection (FS) technique for choosing an optimal subset of features shows the novelty of the work. Moreover, the deep neural network (DNN) model can be applied as a classification model to detect the existence of prostate cancer in the microarray gene expression data. Furthermore, the hyperparameters of the DNN model can be effectively adjusted by the use of RMSprop optimizer.

Methods:   Patients with pathologically diagnosed PCa (PCa group, n = 25), patients with other benign prostate diseases (benign group, n = 25), and men who underwent normal physical examination (control group, n = 25) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine between October 2020 and January 2021 were included.

Results:   There were statistically significant differences in IL-6 and F/T among the three groups (all P < 0.05), but there were no statistically significant differences in UA (P > 0.05). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the three indicators was, respectively, as follows: PCa group-benign group 0.5416, 0.6776, and 0.6832; PCa group-control group 0.5432, 0.9536, and 0.9887; and benign group-control group 0.5000, 0.8784, and 0.9456.

The most preferred features include: (1) well-curated, specific content, (2) individualized feedback from trusted sources, (3) moderated peer discussion, and (4) support from small teams and peer mentors. These findings inform digital PA programs that survivors will find engaging and can promote PA.""","""['Savitha Sangameswaran', 'Courtney Segal', 'Dori E Rosenberg', 'Reggie Casanova-Perez', 'David Cronkite', 'John L Gore', 'Andrea L Hartzler']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""AMIA Annu Symp Proc""","""[""Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer Survivors' Experiences of Using Publicly Available Physical Activity Mobile Apps: Qualitative Study."", 'Exercise participation, barriers, and preferences in Korean prostate cancer survivors.', ""Breast Cancer Survivors' Perspectives on Motivational and Personalization Strategies in Mobile App-Based Physical Activity Coaching Interventions: Qualitative Study."", 'Physical activity programming and counseling preferences among cancer survivors: a systematic review.', ""Survivors' preferences for the organization and delivery of supportive care after treatment: An integrative review.""]"""

We attempted to evaluate the prognostic role of the slope associated with nadir PSA in patients treated with PADT.  Methods:   A total of 107 patients who were treated with PADT from 2015 to 2019 were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model were used to analyze the prognostic significance of the slope associated with nadir PSA in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   After PADT, the median follow-up duration was 40.1 months; 66 patients (61.7%) had disease progression, and 33 patients (30.8%) died. In the univariate analysis, T stage, N stage, nadir PSA, time to PSA nadir, nadir PSA declining slope (nPSA-DS), nadir PSA percentage declining slope (nPSA-PDS), and nadir PSA line slope (nPSA-LS) were significant predictors for PFS and OS. The multivariate analysis showed that a higher nPSA-DS (> - 0.74) and lower PSA nadir (≤0.16 ng/ml) were independent predictors for prolonged survival. The significance of nPSA-DS and nPSA was supported by the analysis of nPSA-DS and nPSA as time-dependent covariates. The combined analyses demonstrated that patients with a higher nPSA-DS and lower PSA nadir had the best PFS and OS.  Conclusions:   The slope associated with the nadir PSA of nPSA-DS was a significant independent predictor for patients treated with PADT.

Objective:   To determine whether local recurrences after prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are associated with the presence of and occur more commonly within the region of a PI-RADS 4 or 5 dominant intra-prostatic lesion (DIL) identified on pre-treatment multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Design, setting, and participants:   247 patients with localized prostate cancer treated with SBRT at our institution from 2009-2018 underwent post-treatment biopsies (median time to biopsy: 2.2 years) to evaluate local control.  Interventions:   Prostate SBRT (median 40 Gy in 5 fractions).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   MRIs were read by a single diagnostic radiologist blinded to other patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. The DIL presence, size, location, and extent were then analyzed to determine associations with the post-treatment biopsy outcomes.  Results and limitations:   Among patients who underwent post-treatment biopsies, 39/247 (15.8%) were positive for Gleason-gradable prostate adenocarcinoma, of which 35/39 (90%) had a DIL initially present and 29/39 (74.4%) had a positive biopsy within the DIL. Factors independently associated with post-treatment biopsy outcomes included the presence of a DIL (OR 6.95; p = 0.001), radiographic T3 disease (OR 5.23, p < 0.001), SBRT dose ≥40 Gy (OR 0.26, p = 0.003), and use of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT; OR 0.28, p = 0.027). Among patients with a DIL (N = 149), the only factors associated with post-treatment biopsy outcomes included ≥50% percent cores positive (OR 2.4, p = 0.037), radiographic T3 disease (OR 4.04, p = 0.001), SBRT dose ≥40 Gy (OR 0.22, p < 0.001), and use of ADT (OR 0.21, p = 0.014).  Conclusions:   Our results suggest that men with PI-RADS 4 or 5 DILs have a higher risk of local recurrence after prostate SBRT and that most recurrences are located within the DIL.

Subjects and methods:   Our database included 592 patients who received prostate multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation for active surveillance. Upgrading to significant prostate cancer on MRI-TB was defined as upgrading to G 3+4 (definition 1 - DF1) and 4+3 (DF2). Machine learning classifiers were applied on both classification problems DF1 and DF2.  Results:   Univariate analysis showed that older age and the number of positive cores on pre-MRI-TB were positively correlated with upgrading by DF1 (P-value ≤ 0.05). Upgrading by DF2 was positively correlated with age and the number of positive cores and negatively correlated with body mass index. For upgrading prediction, the AdaBoost model was highly predictive of upgrading by DF1 (AUC 0.952), while for prediction of upgrading by DF2, the Random Forest model had a lower but excellent prediction performance (AUC 0.947).

However, it is unknown if men with more advanced disease are willing to partake in such interventions.  Purpose:   To determine the feasibility of a home-based exercise intervention in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   mCRPC patients on androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) were prescribed a 12-week, home-based exercise intervention using resistance bands and walking. Feasibility was assessed using recruitment, retention, adherence, and outcome capture. Physiological changes and patient reported outcomes were assessed before and after the intervention.  Results:   Of the 62 referrals, 47 were eligible with 22 men performing baseline testing (47% recruitment rate) and 16 completing the intervention (73% retention). Task completion was >86% for all physiological tests. Walking adherence was 80% and resistance training was 63%, the latter falling short of the study target (75%). Training increased thigh muscle cross-sectional area by 22%, time to exhaustion by 19% (both p < 0.05) and peak oxygen uptake by 6% (p = 0.057). Improvements in short physical performance battery scores and 400 m walk demonstrated moderate effect sizes that did not reach significance.  Conclusions:   Home-based exercise is feasible during ARSI treatment for mCRPC. Greater endurance capacity and localized hypertrophy appear as the primary improvements following training.

There is no conventional therapeutic approach for PCa patients with NED pathologic features because the molecular targets are unknown. Here, we evaluated the regulatory mechanism of NED-associated metabolic reprogramming induced by ADT. We detected that the loss of the androgen-responsive transcription factor, zinc finger, and BTB domain containing 10 (ZBTB10), can activate pyruvate kinase L/R (PKLR) to enhance a NED response that is associated with glucose uptake by PCa cells. PKLR exhibits a tumor-promoting effect in PCa after ADT, but ZBTB10 can compensate for the glucose metabolism and NED capacity of PKLR through the direct transcriptional downregulation of PKLR. Targeting PKLR by drug repurposing with FDA-approved compounds can reduce the aggressiveness and NED of ADT-resistant PCa. We demonstrated that PKLR acts as a modulator to activate NED in PCa enhancement by loss of ZBTB10, thereby enabling PCa cells to mount a glycolysis response essential for therapeutic resistance.

Aim:   The purpose of this study is to evaluate ejaculatory function following SBRT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two hundred and thirty-one patients on a prospective quality of life study with baseline ejaculatory capacity treated with prostate SBRT from 2013 to 2019 were included in this analysis. Ejaculation was assessed via the Ejaculation Scale (ES-8) from the Male Sexual Health Questionnaire. Patients completed the questionnaire at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months post-SBRT. Elderly patients (Age > 70) and those who received hormonal therapy were excluded from analysis. Patients were treated to 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions delivered with the CyberKnife Radiosurgical System (Accuray).  Outcomes:   Ejaculatory function was assessed by ES-8 scores (range 4-40) with lower values representing increased interference or annoyance.  Results:   Median age at the time of treatment was 65 years. Median follow up was 24 months (IQR 19-24.5 months). 64.5% of patients had ED at baseline (SHIM < 22). The 2-year anejaculation rate was 15%. Mean composite ES-8 scores showed a decline in the first month following treatment then stabilized: 30.4 (start of treatment); 26.5 (1 month); 27.6 (3 month); 27.0 (6 month); 26.2 (9 month); 25.4 (12 month); 25.0 (18 month) and 25.4 (24 month). White race, higher pre-treatment SHIM (≥22), and higher ES-8 (≥31) at treatment start were significantly associated with a decreased probability of a clinically significant decline. Patient-reported ejaculate volume was significantly reduced at all time points post-SBRT. Ejaculatory discomfort peaked at 1 month and 9 months post-SBRT. Prior to treatment, 8.0% of men reported that they were very to extremely bothered by their ejaculatory dysfunction. The number of patients reporting this concern increased to 14.4% at one year and dropped to 11% at 24-months post-SBRT.  Clinical translation:   Patients undergoing prostate SBRT may experience meaningful changes in ejaculatory function and should be counseled on the trajectory of these side effects.  Strengths & limitations:   This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. Subjective questionnaire responses captured limited aspects of ejaculatory function in this cohort.  Conclusion:   The high incidence of moderate to extreme bother in ejaculatory function before and after SBRT suggests a need for novel approaches to improving ejaculation.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of homo sapiens solute carrier family 4 member 4 (SLC4A4), which encodes the electrogenic Na+/HCO3- cotransporter isoform 1 (NBCe1), in the development and progression of PCa.  Methods:   The expression levels of SLC4A4 in PCa and normal prostate tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The SLC4A4 knockdown cell model was structured by lentiviral infection, and the knockdown efficiency was validated by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. The effects of SLC4A4 knockdown on cell proliferation, apoptosis and cycle, migration, and invasion were detected by Celigo cell counting assay and CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, wound-healing, and Transwell assay, respectively. Tumor growth in nude mice was surveyed by in vivo imaging and Ki-67 staining. Furthermore, underlying mechanism of SLC4A4 silence induced inhibition of PCa progression was explored by human phospho-kinase array.  Results:   Our results revealed that SLC4A4 expression was up-regulated in PCa tissues and human PCa cell lines. High expression of SLC4A4 in tumor specimens was significantly correlated with disease progression. SLC4A4 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, while facilitated apoptosis, which was also confirmed in vivo. Moreover, SLC4A4 promoted PCa progression through the AKT-mediated signalling pathway.  Conclusion:   The results of this study indicated that SLC4A4 overexpression was closely associated with the progression of PCa; SLC4A4 knockdown suppressed PCa development in vitro and in vivo.

During cancer treatments, some tumor cells switch to a ""dormant mode"" to help tumor cells avoid attack from the immune system and anti-tumor therapies. In this dormant mode, tumor cells can be resuscitated, causing cancer to reoccur. The generally accepted explanation for this phenomenon is that the tumor cells have spread to the bone marrow before treatment and are dormant in the bone marrow. However, the key mechanism for inducing and maintaining the dormancy of these prostate cancer disseminated tumor cells in the bone marrow is still unclear. Therefore, studying the dormancy mechanism of tumor cells in bone metastasis is of great significance for the treatment and the prevention of recurrence of prostate cancer.  Methods:   We obtained single-cell RNA-seq data of tumors from mouse models of prostate cancer bone metastasis mouse model numbered (GSE147150) from the GEO database, and obtained RNA-seq expression data and clinical information from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA) of prostate cancer patients from the USCS Xena database. Screening of differential genes and annotation of GO functions were performed separately. Subsequently, the screened differential genes were compared and analyzed with 50 classic Hallmark signaling pathways, and the prognosis analysis of prostate cancer patients in TCGA data was performed to discover the key genes of the dormant mechanism of tumor cells in bone metastasis, and obtain new biomarkers that can be used to predict the prognosis of patients.  Results:   A total of 378 differentially expressed genes were screened, of which 293 were significantly up-regulated and 85 were significantly down-regulated. Among them, the up-regulated genes were mainly related to the immune response, and the down-regulated genes were mainly related to the cell cycle. Through GSVA (Gene set variation analysis), it is found that there are differences in a total of 3 signal pathways: COMPLEMENT, MYC_TARGETS_V1 and MYC_TARGETS_V2. By comparing and analyzing the significantly down-regulated genes in dormant tumor cells with MYC_TARGETS_V1, MYC_TARGETS_V2, three significantly down-regulated genes were obtained: Ccna2, Mad2L1 and Plk1.  Conclusion:   In summary, our findings indicate that the MYC targeting gene Mad2L1 is potentially related to the dormancy mechanism of prostate cancer. At the same time, Mad2L1, a gene associated with dormant prostate cancer cells, may be used as a biomarker for prognostic survival.""","""['Xing Wang', 'Jiandi Yu', 'Junfeng Yan', 'Kun Peng', 'Haiyong Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Bioinformatic analysis revealing mitotic spindle assembly regulated NDC80 and MAD2L1 as prognostic biomarkers in non-small cell lung cancer development.', 'Secreted Protein Acidic and Rich in Cysteine (SPARC) Mediates Metastatic Dormancy of Prostate Cancer in Bone.', 'Screening of Target Genes and Regulatory Function of miRNAs as Prognostic Indicators for Prostate Cancer.', 'Bone Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms Implicated in Tumour Cell Dormancy in Breast and Prostate Cancer.', 'The biology and clinical implications of prostate cancer dormancy and metastasis.', 'The genomic regulation of metastatic dormancy.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

This report investigates the impact of curative-intent radiotherapy on HRQoL and toxicity in early stage and locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy enrolled in the observational prospective REQUITE study.  Materials and methods:   HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 questionnaire up to 2 years post radiotherapy. Eleven toxicities were scored by clinicians using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4. Toxicity scores were calculated by subtracting baseline values. Mixed model analyses were applied to determine statistical significance (p ≤ 0.01). Meaningful clinical important differences (MCID) were determined for changes in HRQoL. Analysis was performed on the overall data, different radiotherapy techniques, multimodality treatments and disease stages.  Results:   Data of 510 patients were analysed. There was no significant change in HRQoL or its domains, except for deterioration in cognitive functioning (p = 0.01). Radiotherapy technique had no significant impact on HRQoL. The addition of chemotherapy was significantly associated with HRQoL over time (p <.001). Overall toxicity did not significantly change over time. Acute toxicities of radiation-dermatitis (p =.003), dysphagia (p =.002) and esophagitis (p <.001) peaked at 3 months and decreased thereafter. Pneumonitis initially deteriorated but improved significantly after 12 months (p =.011). A proportion of patients experienced meaningful clinically important improvements and deteriorations in overall HRQoL and its domains. In some patients, pre-treatment symptoms improved gradually.  Conclusions:   While overall HRQoL and toxicity did not change over time, some patients improved, whereas others experienced acute radiotherapy-induced toxicities and deteriorated HRQoL, especially physical and cognitive functioning. Patient characteristics, more so than radiotherapy technique and treatment modality, impact post-radiotherapy toxicity and HRQoL outcomes. This stresses the importance of considering the potential impact of radiotherapy on individuals' HRQoL, symptoms and toxicity in treatment decision-making.""","""['Lotte Van der Weijst', 'Miguel E Aguado-Barrera', 'David Azria', 'Patrick Berkovic', 'Pierre Boisselier', 'Erik Briers', 'Renée Bultijnck', 'Patricia Calvo-Crespo', 'Jenny Chang-Claude', 'Ananya Choudhury', 'Gilles Defraene', 'Sylvian Demontois', 'Alison M Dunning', 'Rebecca M Elliott', 'Dawn Ennis', 'Corinne Faivre-Finn', 'Marzia Franceschini', 'Sara Gutiérrez-Enríquez', 'Carsten Herskind', 'Daniel S Higginson', 'Sarah L Kerns', 'Kerstie Johnson', 'Meritxell Mollà', 'Maarten Lambrecht', 'Mónica Ramos', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Andreas Rimner', 'Barry S Rosenstein', 'Dirk De Ruysscher', 'Ahmed Salem', 'Claudia Sangalli', 'Petra Seibold', 'Paloma Sosa-Fajardo', 'Elena Sperk', 'Hilary Stobart', 'Holly Summersgill', 'Veerle Surmont', 'Paul Symonds', 'Begoña Taboada-Lorenzo', 'Christopher J Talbot', 'Riccardo Valdagni', 'Ana Vega', 'Liv Veldeman', 'Marlon R Veldwijk', 'Tim Ward', 'Adam Webb', 'Catharine M L West;REQUITE Consortium;Yolande Lievens']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Lung Cancer""","""['The correlation between pre-treatment symptoms, acute and late toxicity and patient-reported health-related quality of life in non-small cell lung cancer patients: Results of the REQUITE study.', 'Real Life Data on Patient-Reported Outcomes and Neuro-Cognitive Functioning of Lung Cancer Patients: The PRO-Long Study.', 'Quality of life assessment in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients undergoing an accelerated radiotherapy regimen: report of ECOG study 4593.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common malignancies in men. The transition to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a lethal form that is still lacking an effective cure, could be influenced by fine tuning intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) homeostasis. This study investigates [Ca2+]i dynamics in metastatic PCa cell lines that mimic the progression of PCa to CRPC: (i) well differentiated LNCaP cells that require androgen for survival, and (ii) poorly differentiated, highly aggressive androgen-insensitive prostate cancer (AIPC) PC3 and DU145 cells. In AIPC cells, ATP induces a fast rise in [Ca2+]i, due to release from intracellular stores and sensitive to phospholipase C inhibitors, while LNCaP cells do not respond to ATP challenge. Moreover, AIPC cells showed a reduced capacity to store Ca2+ in thapsigargin-sensitive stores and limited store-operated calcium entry, with respect to androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. Finally, green tea extract causes [Ca2+]i elevation and inhibits proliferation in PC3 and DU145 cells, but is ineffective in LNCaP cells.

Methods:   Self-reported receipt of a survivorship care plan (SCP) and information on various aspects of survivorship care (e.g., managing side effects, healthy lifestyles, psychosocial advice and monitoring for recurrence) were collected from 215 cancer survivors who had returned home to a rural area in Queensland Australia after receiving cancer treatment in a major city within the previous 5 years (72% in the previous 12 months). Logistic regression was used to assess for differences across demographic factors and cancer type.  Results:   Only 35% of participants reported receiving a SCP and proportions of those reporting the receipt of specific information varied from 74% for information on short-term side effects to less than 30% for information on finances, chemoprevention and monitoring for signs of recurrence. No significant differences were found in the receipt of survivorship care information across demographic factors or cancer type.  Conclusions:   Findings suggest that cancer survivors living in rural areas are not consistently provided with adequate survivorship care information, particularly that pertaining to long-term health and recovery.

However, the efficacy of such drugs is often limited by the emergence of resistance, mediated through point mutations and receptor splice variants lacking the AR-LBD. As a result, the prognosis for patients with malignant, castrate-resistant disease remains poor. The amino terminal domain (NTD) of the AR has been shown to be critical for AR function. Its modular activation function (AF-1) is important for both gene regulation and participation in protein-protein interactions. However, due to the intrinsically disordered structure of the domain, its potential as a candidate for therapeutic intervention has been generally overlooked. In this article, we describe the design and development of a functional cell-based assay aimed at identifying small-molecule inhibitors of the AR-NTD.

In this study, we determined the role of polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), which regulates centriole duplication and centrosome amplification (CA), in PCa.  Materials and methods:   Employing human PCa tissue microarrays, we assessed the prevalence of CA, correlated with Gleason score, and estimated major causes of CA in PCa (cell doubling vs. centriole overduplication) by staining for mother/mature centrioles. We also assessed PLK4 expression and correlated it with CA in human PCa tissues and cell lines. Further, we determined the effects of PLK4 inhibition in human PCa cells.  Results:   Compared to benign prostate, human PCa demonstrated significantly higher CA, which was also positively correlated with the Gleason score. Further, most cases of CA were found to arise by centriole overduplication rather than cell doubling events (e.g., cytokinesis failure) in PCa. In addition, PLK4 was overexpressed in human PCa cell lines and tumors. Moreover, PLK4 inhibitors CFI-400945 and centrinone-B inhibited cell growth, viability, and colony formation of both androgen-responsive and androgen-independent PCa cell lines. PLK4 inhibition also induced cell cycle arrest and senescence in human PCa cells.  Conclusions:   CA is prevalent in PCa and arises predominantly by centriole overduplication as opposed to cell doubling events. Loss of centrioles is cellular stress that can promote senescence and suggests that PLK4 inhibition may be a viable therapeutic strategy in PCa.""","""['Chandra K Singh', 'Ryan A Denu', 'Minakshi Nihal', 'Maria Shabbir', 'Debra R Garvey', 'Wei Huang', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'Nihal Ahmad']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Centriole Overduplication is the Predominant Mechanism Leading to Centrosome Amplification in Melanoma.', 'Cep78 is a new centriolar protein involved in Plk4-induced centriole overduplication.', 'Autophosphorylation of polo-like kinase 4 and its role in centriole duplication.', 'Role of Polo-like Kinases Plk1 and Plk4 in the Initiation of Centriole Duplication-Impact on Cancer.', 'The PLK4-STIL-SAS-6 module at the core of centriole duplication.', 'Polo-like kinase 4 (Plk4) potentiates anoikis-resistance of p53KO mammary epithelial cells by inducing a hybrid EMT phenotype.', 'Aberrant expression of polo-like kinase 4 in renal cell carcinoma: Association with clinicopathological characteristics and long-term survival.', 'Targeting senescence as an anticancer therapy.', 'Effects of the PLK4 inhibitor Centrinone on the biological behaviors of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines.']"""

Immunotherapies (antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and chimeric antigen receptor T cells) targeting B7-H3 are currently in clinical trials; therefore, elucidating the molecular and immune microenvironment correlates of B7-H3 expression may help to guide trial design and interpretation. The authors tested the interconnected hypotheses that B7-H3 expression is associated with genetic racial ancestry, immune cell composition, and androgen receptor signaling in PCa.  Methods:   An automated, clinical-grade immunohistochemistry assay was developed by to digitally quantify B7-H3 protein expression across 2 racially diverse cohorts of primary PCa (1 with previously reported transcriptomic data) and pretreatment and posttreatment PCa tissues from a trial of intensive neoadjuvant hormonal therapy.  Results:   B7-H3 protein expression was significantly lower in self-identified Black patients and was inversely correlated with the percentage African ancestry. This association with race was independent of the significant association of B7-H3 protein expression with ERG/ETS and PTEN status. B7-H3 messenger RNA expression, but not B7-H3 protein expression, was significantly correlated with regulatory (FOXP3-positive) T-cell density. Finally, androgen receptor activity scores were significantly correlated with B7-H3 messenger RNA expression, and neoadjuvant intensive hormonal therapy was associated with a significant decrease in B7-H3 protein expression.  Conclusions:   The current data underscore the importance of studying racially and molecularly diverse PCa cohorts in the immunotherapy era. This study is among the first to use genetic ancestry markers to add to the emerging evidence that PCa in men of African ancestry may have a distinct biology associated with B7-H3 expression.  Lay summary:   B7-H3 is an immunomodulatory molecule that is highly expressed in prostate cancer and is under investigation in clinical trials. The authors determined that B7-H3 protein expression is inversely correlated with an individual's proportion of African ancestry. The results demonstrate that B7-H3 messenger RNA expression is correlated with the density of tumor T-regulatory cells. Finally, in the first paired analysis of B7-H3 protein expression before and after neoadjuvant intensive hormone therapy, the authors determined that hormone therapy is associated with a decrease in B7-H3 protein levels, suggesting that androgen signaling may positively regulate B7-H3 expression.

This study aimed: (1) to determine the validity of the self-performed FTSTS test in comparison to a supervised reference test and (2) to determine the reliability of a self-performed FTSTS test by cancer survivors.  Background:   Early detection of frailty in cancer survivors may enable prehabilitation interventions before surgery or intensive treatment, improving cancer outcomes.  Design:   A repeated measures reliability and agreement study, with one week in between measures, was performed.  Methods:   Cancer survivors (n = 151) performed two FTSTS tests themselves. One additional reference FTSTS test was supervised by a physical therapist. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), structural error of measurement (SEM) and minimally important clinical difference (MID) were calculated comparing a self-performed FTSTS test to the reference test, and comparing two self-performed FTSTS tests. The Guidelines for Reporting Reliability and Agreement Studies (GRASS) have been used.  Results:   Mean age of cancer survivors was 65.6 years (SD = 9.3), 54.6% were female, median time since diagnosis was 2 years [IQR = 1], and tumour type varied (e.g., breast cancer (31.8%), prostate cancer (17.2%), gastrointestinal cancer (11.9%) and haematological cancer (11.9%)). Validity of the self-performed FTSTS test at home was acceptable in comparison with the reference test (ICC = .74; SEM = 3.2; MID = 3.6) as was the reliability of the self-performed FTSTS test (ICC = .70; SEM = 2.2; MID = 3.8).  Conclusions:   The self-performed FTSTS test is a valid and reliable measure to assess lower body function and has potential to be used as objective (pre-)screening tool for frailty in cancer survivors.  Relevance to clinical practice:   The self-performed FTSTS test at home may indicate the cancer survivors in need of prehabilitation in advance of surgery or intensive treatment.

Based on the gene score, incorrect classification according to hypoxic fraction in whole-mount sections was seen in one third of the patients. The incorrect classifications were apparently not due to intra-tumour heterogeneity, since the score had low heterogeneity compared to pimonidazole-defined hypoxic fraction in biopsies.

The two groups were comparable in terms of age, gender and body mass index. Breast, kidney, prostate and lung cancers were the most frequent primary tumors. Prognostic and instability scores were comparable. Short- and medium-term pain assessment showed comparable results. Median survival was 208 days in the open surgery group and 224days in the MIS group (p=0.5299).  Conclusion:   MIS techniques aim to limit the surgical approach and allow a faster introduction of adjuvant treatments than after open surgery. Our study did not find any differences between open and MIS surgery in terms of pain, neurological evolution or survival time in patients treated for thoracolumbar spinal metastases.

Patients and methods:   All cases of localized prostate cancer presenting in an irradiated area who received salvage high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy from 2013 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed.  Results:   A total of 64 patients were included. Median follow up was 30.5 months. Median initial EBRT dose was 70 Gy [Q1-Q3: 70 - 74]. Median PSA at brachytherapy was 6.8 ng/mL [Q1-Q3: 4.4 - 8.7] with a median interval between first and salvage irradiation of 10 years [Q1-Q3: 6.9 - 12.6]. The modality of the first irradiation was an exclusive EBRT in 73% of the cases, mostly with a 3D technique (82%). Dose prescription was two fractions of 12 Gy or 13 Gy associated with androgen deprivation therapy for 63% of the patients. About 23% of the patients were castrate-resistant. Disease free survival at 2 years was 58% in the whole population and 66% in hormone sensitive patients. The only factors associated with disease free survival on multivariate analysis was a high-risk disease at initial diagnosis (HR = 3.59, IC95 [1.75; 7.39], p = 0.0005).

Our aim is to examine long term, up to 5 year erectile function status of patients after Radical Perineal Prostatectomy (RPP).  Materials and methods:   One hundred and thirty-two patients, who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing Radical Perineal Prostatectomy (RPP) in between January 2012 and January 2017, with preoperative age≤70, prostate volume<80g, transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy Gleason score (GS)<7, prostate specific antigen (PSA) value<10ng/mL, and cT stage≤2 (N0, M0) were included into this study. Exclusion criteria were previous cardiovascular diseases, serious chronic renal and/or hepatic insufficiency, neurological diseases, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, and severe lung diseases. Patients who received additional treatment (hormonal and/or radiotherapy) after RPP were also excluded from the study group. Erectile function was evaluated before surgery and at postoperative 3rd, 12th, and 60th months. Patients with an ""International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) - 5"" score of ≥21 and patients whose IIEF-5 scores were between 16 and 20 but responded as ""yes"" to the ""Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) - 2"" and ""SEP-3"" questions were accepted as having normal erectile function.  Results:   Out of the 132 patients, 96 (72.7%) of the patients were found to be potent in the first postoperative year. A total of 118 patients were evaluated at the end of 5 years.

Transcription factors initially thought to be repressed from binding by DNA methylation, have recently emerged as being able to shape DNA methylation patterns.  Results:   Here, we integrated the massive amount of data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas to predict transcription factors driving aberrant DNA methylation in 13 cancer types. We identified differentially methylated regions between cancer and matching healthy samples, searched for transcription factor motifs enriched in those regions and selected transcription factors with corresponding changes in gene expression. We predict transcription factors known to be involved in cancer as well as novel candidates to drive hypo-methylated regions such as FOXA1 and GATA3 in breast cancer, FOXA1 and TWIST1 in prostate cancer and NFE2L2 in lung cancer. We also predict transcription factors that lead to hyper-methylated regions upon transcription factor loss such as EGR1 in several cancer types. Finally, we validate that FOXA1 and GATA3 mediate hypo-methylated regions in breast cancer cells.

However, while most studies of cancer examined a single cancer type using different cohorts, few studies compared the associations of PM between different cancer types. We aimed to compare the association of long-term exposure to PM (PM10 and PM2.5) and cancer mortality across 17 different types of cancer using a population-based cohort in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), South Korea; Our study population includes 87,608 subjects (mean age: 46.58 years) residing in the SMA from the National Health Insurance Services-National Sample cohort (NHIS-NSC) and followed up for 2007-2015.

During eight years of follow-up, 1487 people died with any of 17 cancer types. Lung cancer death was the highest, followed by liver and stomach cancer. Although we did not find the association for all cancer types, possibly because of limited cancer cases, HRs of PM2.5 were relatively high for lung, stomach, pancreas, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate, esophagus, oral and pharynx, and brain cancer mortality (HRs = 1.44-7.14). High HRs for pancreas, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, esophagus, and oral and pharynx cancer were also seen for PM10; our findings suggest PM air pollution as a potential risk factor of cancer mortality for upper digestive tracts, mouth, pancreas, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a highly urbanized population with high exposure to PM for a long time.""","""['Miyoun Shin', 'Ok-Jin Kim', 'Seongwoo Yang', 'Seung-Ah Choe', 'Sun-Young Kim']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Association between long-term exposure to high levels of ambient air pollution and incidence of lung cancer in a population-based cohort.', 'Incident cardiovascular disease and particulate matter air pollution in South Korea using a population-based and nationwide cohort of 0.2 million adults.', 'Association between Long-Term Exposure to Particulate Matter Air Pollution and Mortality in a South Korean National Cohort: Comparison across Different Exposure Assessment Approaches.', ""Does utilizing WHO's interim targets further reduce the risk - meta-analysis on ambient particulate matter pollution and mortality of cardiovascular diseases?"", 'Are current Chinese national ambient air quality standards on 24-hour averages for particulate matter sufficient to protect public health?', 'Ambient exposures to selected volatile organic compounds and the risk of prostate cancer in Montreal.', 'Long-Term Exposure to Fine Particulate Matter and the Risk of Chronic Liver Diseases: A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.', 'Particulate Matter Exposure after a Cancer Diagnosis and All-Cause Mortality in a Regional Cancer Registry-Based Cohort in South Korea.']"""

In this study, CBRs were characterized in several cancer cell lines. Radioligand binding screens surprisingly revealed specific binding only for the non-selective cannabinoid [3H]WIN-55,212-2, and not [3H]CP-55,940, indicating that the expressed CBRs exhibit atypical binding properties. Furthermore, [3H]WIN-55,212-2 bound to a single site in all cancer cells with high affinity and varying densities. CBR characteristics were next compared between human prostate cancer cell lines expressing low (PC-3) and high (DU-145) CBR density. Although mRNA for canonical CBRs was detected in both cell lines, only 5 out of 15 compounds with known high affinity for canonical CBRs displaced [3H]WIN-55,212-2 binding. Functional assays further established that CBRs in prostate cancer cells exhibit distinct signaling properties relative to canonical Gi/Go-coupled CBRs. Prostate cancer cells chronically exposed to both CBR agonists and antagonists/inverse agonists produced receptor downregulation, inconsistent with actions at canonical CBRs. Treatment of DU-145 cells with CBR ligands increased LDH-release, decreased ATP-dependent cell viability, and produced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. In summary, several cancer cell lines express CBRs with binding and signaling profiles dissimilar to canonical CBRs.

In addition to socioeconomic factors, emerging evidence suggests that intrinsic biological differences may explain part of PCa disparities. In this study, we applied microRNA (miRNA)-driven bioinformatics to evaluate whether differential miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks play a role in promoting the AA PCa disparities. 10 differentially expressed miRNAs were imported to mirPath V.3 algorithm, leading to identification of 58 signaling pathways differentially regulated in AA PCa versus EA PCa. Among these pathways, we particularly focused on mTOR and VEGF signaling, where we identified 5 reciprocal miRNA-mRNA pairings: miR-34a-5p/HIF1A, miR-34a-5p/PIK3CB, miR-34a-5p/IGFBP2, miR-99b-5p/MTOR and miR-96-5p/MAPKAPK2 in AA PCa versus EA PCa. RT-qPCR validation confirmed that miR-34a-5p, miR-99b-5p and MAPKAPK2 were downregulated, while miR-96-5p, IGFBP2, HIF1A, PIK3CB and MTOR were upregulated in AA PCa versus EA PCa cells. Transfection of miRNA mimics/antagomir followed by RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis further verified that IGFBP2, HIF1A and PIK3CB are negatively regulated by miR-34a-5p, whereas MTOR and MAPKAPK2 are negatively regulated by miR-99b-5p and miR-96-5p, respectively, at mRNA and protein levels. Targeting reciprocal pairings by miR-34a-5p mimic, miR-99b-5p mimic or miR-96-5p antagomir downregulates HIF1α, PI3Kβ, mTOR, IGFBP2 but upregulates MAPKAPK2, subsequently reducing cell proliferation and sensitizing docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in PCa cells. These results suggest that miRNA-mRNA regulatory network plays a critical role in AA PCa disparities, and targeting these core miRNA-mRNA pairings may reduce PCa aggressiveness and overcome the chemoresistance in AA patients.""","""['Himali Gujrati', 'Siyoung Ha', 'Azah Mohamed', 'Bi-Dar Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Downregulation of miR-99b-5p and Upregulation of Nuclear mTOR Cooperatively Promotes the Tumor Aggressiveness and Drug Resistance in African American Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification and Functional Validation of Reciprocal microRNA-mRNA Pairings in African American Prostate Cancer Disparities.', 'MicroRNA-99b-5p targets mTOR/AR axis, induces autophagy and inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'miRNAs as drivers of TMPRSS2-ERG negative prostate tumors in African American men.', 'MicroRNA-34a, Prostate Cancer Stem Cells, and Therapeutic Development.', 'RNA activation in ticks.', 'Network regulatory mechanism of ncRNA on the Wnt signaling pathway in osteoporosis.', 'Molecular Insight into Drug Resistance Mechanism Conferred by Aberrant PIK3CD Splice Variant in African American Prostate Cancer.', 'Downregulation of miR-99b-5p and Upregulation of Nuclear mTOR Cooperatively Promotes the Tumor Aggressiveness and Drug Resistance in African American Prostate Cancer.', 'Examples of Inverse Comorbidity between Cancer and Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Possible Role for Noncoding RNA.']"""

Notably, hypoxia associates with increased metastasis and poor survival in patients. Therefore, to aid therapeutic decisions and better understand hypoxia's role in cancer progression, it is critical to identify endogenous biomarkers of hypoxia to spatially phenotype oncogenic lesions in human tissue, whether precancerous, benign, or malignant. Here, we characterize the glucose transporter GLUT3/SLC2A3 as a biomarker of hypoxic prostate epithelial cells and prostate tumors. Transcriptomic analyses of non-tumorigenic, immortalized prostate epithelial cells revealed a highly significant increase in GLUT3 expression under hypoxia. Additionally, GLUT3 protein increased 2.4-fold in cultured hypoxic prostate cell lines and was upregulated within hypoxic regions of xenograft tumors, including two patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Finally, GLUT3 out-performs other established hypoxia markers; GLUT3 staining in PDX specimens detects 2.6-8.3 times more tumor area compared to a mixture of GLUT1 and CA9 antibodies. Therefore, given the heterogeneous nature of tumors, we propose adding GLUT3 to immunostaining panels when trying to detect hypoxic regions in prostate samples.""","""['John M Ryniawec', 'Matthew R Coope', 'Emily Loertscher', 'Vignesh Bageerathan', 'Diogo de Oliveira Pessoa', 'Noel A Warfel', 'Anne E Cress', 'Megha Padi', 'Gregory C Rogers']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Diagnostics (Basel)""","""['Expression of hypoxia-related glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT3 in benign, malignant and non-neoplastic thyroid lesions.', 'Regulation of pH by Carbonic Anhydrase 9 Mediates Survival of Pancreatic Cancer Cells With Activated KRAS in Response to Hypoxia.', 'GLUT3 expression in cystic change induced by hypoxia in pituitary adenomas.', 'Molecular and cellular regulation of glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins in cancer.', 'Cellular effects and clinical implications of SLC2A3 copy number variation.', 'Identification of SLC2A3 as a prognostic indicator correlated with the NF-κB/EMT axis and immune response in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.', 'Druggable Metabolic Vulnerabilities Are Exposed and Masked during Progression to Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Comprehensive Analysis of the Role of SLC2A3 on Prognosis and Immune Infiltration in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The predictive accuracy of preoperative erythrocyte count and maximum tumor diameter to maximum kidney diameter ratio in renal cell carcinoma.']"""

Recent studies have suggested that calreticulin (CRT), a multifunctional chaperon protein, may play an important role in the regulation of PCa tumorigenesis and progression. However, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Integrin is an important regulator of cancer metastasis. Our previous study demonstrated that in J82 bladder cancer cells, CRT affects integrin activity through FUBP-1-FUT-1-dependent fucosylation, rather than directly affecting the expression of β1-integrin itself. However, whether this regulatory mechanism is conserved among different cell types remains to be determined. Herein, we attempted to determine the effects of CRT on β1-integrin in human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. CRT expression was suppressed in PC-3 cells through siRNA treatment, and then the expression levels of FUT-1 and β1-integrin were monitored through RT-PCR. We found that knockdown of CRT expression in PC-3 cells significantly affected the expression of β1-integrin itself. In addition, the lower expression level of β1-integrin was due to affecting the mRNA stability. In contrast, FUT-1 expression level was not affected by knockdown of CRT. These results strongly suggested that CRT regulates cellular behavior differently in different cell types. We further confirmed that CRT directly binds to the 3'UTR of β1-integrin mRNA by EMSA and therefore affects its stability. The suppression of CRT expression also affects PC-3 cell adhesion to type I collagen substrate. In addition, the levels of total and activated β1-integrin expressed on cell surface were both significantly suppressed by CRT knockdown. Furthermore, the intracellular distribution of β1-integrin was also affected by lowering the expression of CRT. This change in distribution is not lysosomal nor proteosomal pathway-dependent. The treatment of fucosydase significantly affected the activation of surface β1-integrin, which is conserved among different cell types. These results suggested that CRT affects the expression of β1-integrin through distinct regulatory mechanisms.""","""['Yueh-Chien Lin', 'Yuan-Li Huang', 'Ming-Hua Wang', 'Chih-Yu Chen', 'Wei-Min Chen', 'Yi-Cheng Weng', 'Pei-Yi Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomedicines""","""['Calreticulin activates β1 integrin via fucosylation by fucosyltransferase 1 in J82 human bladder cancer cells.', 'Calreticulin Is Involved in Invasion of Human Extravillous Trophoblasts Through Functional Regulation of Integrin β1.', 'Calreticulin regulates TGF-β1-induced epithelial mesenchymal transition through modulating Smad signaling and calcium signaling.', 'Changes in tumor growth and metastatic capacities of J82 human bladder cancer cells suppressed by down-regulation of calreticulin expression.', 'Integrin β1 in Pancreatic Cancer: Expressions, Functions, and Clinical Implications.', 'Calreticulin as a marker and therapeutic target for cancer.']"""

Despite the impressive response rates shortly after initiation of MTA-based therapy, the vast majority of human malignancies develop resistance to MTAs due to the different mechanisms. Here, we report that infigratinib (BGJ 398), a potent FGFR1-4 inhibitor, restores sensitivity of a broad spectrum of ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents, including paclitaxel (PTX) and doxorubicin (Dox). This was evidenced for the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) cell lines, as well. Indeed, when MDR-overexpressing cancer cells were treated with a combination of BGJ 398 and PTX (or Dox), we observed a significant increase of apoptosis which was evidenced by an increased expression of cleaved forms of PARP, caspase-3, and increased numbers of Annexin V-positive cells, as well. Moreover, BGJ 398 used in combination with PTX significantly decreased the viability and proliferation of the resistant cancer cells. As expected, no apoptosis was found in ABCB1-overexpressing cancer cells treated with PTX, Dox, or BGJ 398 alone. Inhibition of FGFR-signaling by BGJ 398 was evidenced by the decreased expression of phosphorylated (i.e., activated) forms of FGFR and FRS-2, a well-known adaptor protein of FGFR signaling, and downstream signaling molecules (e.g., STAT-1, -3, and S6). In contrast, expression of MDR-related ABC-transporters did not change after BGJ 398 treatment, thereby suggesting an impaired function of MDR-related ABC-transporters. By using the fluorescent-labeled chemotherapeutic agent PTX-Alexa488 (Flutax-2) and doxorubicin, exhibiting an intrinsic fluorescence, we found that BGJ 398 substantially impairs their efflux from MDR-overexpressing TNBC cells. Moreover, the efflux of Calcein AM, a well-known substrate for ABCB1, was also significantly impaired in BGJ 398-treated cancer cells, thereby suggesting the ABCB1 as a novel molecular target for BGJ 398. Of note, PD 173074, a potent FGFR1 and VEGFR2 inhibitor failed to retain chemotherapeutic agents inside ABCB1-overexpressing cells. This was consistent with the inability of PD 173074 to sensitize Tx-R cancer cells to PTX and Dox. Collectively, we show here for the first time that BGJ 398 reverses the sensitivity of MDR-overexpressing cancer cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents due to inhibition of their efflux from cancer cells via ABCB1-mediated mechanism.""","""['Sergei Boichuk', 'Pavel Dunaev', 'Ilshat Mustafin', 'Shinjit Mani', 'Kirill Syuzov', 'Elena Valeeva', 'Firuza Bikinieva', 'Aigul Galembikova']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomedicines""","""['Inhibition of FGFR2-Signaling Attenuates a Homology-Mediated DNA Repair in GIST and Sensitizes Them to DNA-Topoisomerase II Inhibitors.', 'Reversal effect of FW-04-806, a macrolide dilactone compound, on multidrug resistance mediated by ABCB1 and ABCG2 in vitro and in vivo.', 'Ceritinib Enhances the Efficacy of Substrate Chemotherapeutic Agent in Human ABCB1-Overexpressing Leukemia Cells In Vitro, In Vivo and Ex-Vivo.', 'Not only P-glycoprotein: Amplification of the ABCB1-containing chromosome region 7q21 confers multidrug resistance upon cancer cells by coordinated overexpression of an assortment of resistance-related proteins.', 'Therapeutic strategies to overcome taxane resistance in cancer.', ""Evolution of the Targeted Therapy Landscape for Cholangiocarcinoma: Is Cholangiocarcinoma the 'NSCLC' of GI Oncology?"", 'Pharmacological Strategies for Overcoming Multidrug Resistance to Chemotherapy.']"""

Therefore, this work introduces an embedding representation that integrates an auxiliary task learning to deal with the high inter and intra appearance of the Gleason system. The proposed strategy implements as a main task a triplet loss scheme that builds a feature embedding space with respect to batches of positive and negative histological training patches. As an auxiliary task is added a cross-entropy that helps with inter-class variability of samples while adding robust representations to the main task. The proposed approach shows promising results achieving an average accuracy of 66% and 64%, for two experts without statistical difference.

Our 3rd generation trithiol chelate with two carboxylic acid groups was further developed as a bifunctional chelate for radioarsenic.  Methods:   The As complex with the trithiol chelate was synthesized and characterized. No carrier added (nca) [77As][H2AsO4-] was used for radiolabeling studies. The trithiol chelate was conjugated to the RM2 peptide (DPhe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2) via solid phase peptide synthesis with two different linkers, Ser-Ser and Glu-Ser. The trithiol chelate and its RM2 bioconjugates were radiolabeled with nca 77As, and the RM2 bioconjugates were compared in initial biodistribution studies.  Results:   The As diacid trithiol complex was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HR-ESI-MS. The trithiol-RM2 precursor and As trithiol bioconjugates were characterized by HR-ESI-MS and/or LC-ESI-MS.

Methods: A 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-coupled 9-amino acid leuprolide peptide was synthesized after typical 9-fluorenylmethyl-oxycarbonyl-based solid-phase peptide synthesis and radiolabeled with both 68Ga and 177Lu radionuclides for theranostic use. The systemic pharmacokinetics was done in healthy balb/c mice. The in vitro tumor cell binding affinity was determined on MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines. In vivo tumor targeting and micro positron-emission tomography imaging was performed on nude mice with MCF7 breast tumor xenografts. Results: The leuprolide peptide was conveniently synthesized by solid-phase synthesis strategy and its identity and purity were validated by mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. The peptide radiolabeled efficiently (˃94%) with both diagnostic (68Ga) and therapeutic (177Lu) radionuclides and displayed nanomolar binding potency to all three tested MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines.

Results:   Patients aged 52-79 years (mean ± SD, 64.8 ± 6.15 yrs), with a median PSA of 9.2 ng/ml (IQR: 6.70, 16.83) and median prostate volume of 31.9 ml (IQR: 30.01, 38.54). 95.28% (101/106) were clinically localized. All patients underwent espRARP successfully with no open conversions. Operative time was 94.2 ± 30.26 min with an estimated blood loss of 68.5 ml (range, 50-120 ml). No Grade III complications or above were documented. Positive surgical margin was 17.9% (19/106). Median pain score at discharge was 0 (IQR: 0, 1.75) without use of opioid narcotics. Postoperative length of stay was 3 days (IQR: 1, 3), in which 28 patients were discharged within 24 h. Instant, 1-, 3-, and 6 month continence recovery was 18.9, 45.3, 79.2, 93.4, and 96.4%, respectively. Of the 43 patients who received nerve-sparing procedures, 13 (30.23%) resumed potency 6 months postoperatively. 12 month biochemical recurrence-free survival was 92.77% (77/83).  Conclusions:   Extraperitoneal single-port robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is a safe and feasible technique. Combined with super-veil nerve-sparing procedures, it may provide satisfactory outcome in short-term functional recovery.""","""['Yifan Chang', 'Weidong Xu', 'Yutian Xiao', 'Ye Wang', 'Shi Yan', 'Shancheng Ren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Comparing the Approach to Radical Prostatectomy Using the Multiport da Vinci Xi and da Vinci SP Robots: A Propensity Score Analysis of Perioperative Outcomes.', 'Initial Experience with da Vinci Single-port Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomies.', 'A comparison of perioperative outcomes between extraperitoneal robotic single-port and multiport radical prostatectomy with the da Vinci Si Surgical System.', 'Single port robotic radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Single-site multiport vs. conventional multiport robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: A propensity score matching comparative study.']"""

The analysis from Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to show an association between HIF-1α expression and survival rate in prostate cancer patients. Murine prostate cell-derived xenograft (CDX) model was set up in both nude mice and BALB/c mice to observe the therapeutic effect of HIF-1α inhibitor IDF-11774. Protein expression of HIF-1α, as well as changes in the immune microenvironment, was detected. Moreover, the synergistic antitumor effect of IDF-11774 and PD-1 antibody was detected in another murine prostate cancer model. HIF-1α was found to have higher expression in prostate cancer tumor tissue than in peritumor tissue, and the expression level was negatively correlated with survival rate (P = 0.0157). HIF-1α inhibitor IDF-11774 reduced tumor volume and exhibited better efficacy in BALB/c mouse model (P < 0.0001) with normal immune system, with the same suppression level against HIF-1α.

It is needed to develop more effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. The present study investigates whether the novel factor 3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzyl alcohol (DHMBA), which was isolated from marine oyster, suppresses the activity of metastatic human prostate cancer PC-3 or DU-145 cells. Culture of DHMBA (1 or 10 µM) suppressed colony formation and growth of PC-3 or DU-145 cells in vitro. Suppressive effects of DHMBA on cell proliferation were not occurred by culturing with intracellular signaling inhibitors. Mechanistically, DHMBA (10 µM) reduced the levels of key proteins linked to promotion of cell growth, including Ras, PI3K, Akt, MAPK, and mTOR in PC-3 cells. Interestingly, DHMBA increased the levels of cancer suppressor p53, p21, Rb, and regucalcin. Moreover, culture of DHMBA simulated the death of PC-3 and DU-145 cells. This effect was implicated to caspase-3 activation in cells. Interestingly, the effects of DHMBA on cell proliferation and death were blocked by culturing with an inhibitor of aryl hydrocarbon receptor linked to transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, culture of DHMBA inhibited production of reactive oxygen species in PC-3 or DU-145 cells. Of note, DHMBA blocked migration and invasion by diminishing their related protein levels, including NF-κB 65, caveolin-1 and integrin β1. The novel marine factor DHMBA was demonstrated to suppress metastatic prostate cancer cells via targeting diverse signaling pathways.

Recent evidence indicates that metformin may slow cancer progression and improves survival in prostate cancer patients, but the mechanism is not well understood. Circulating insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) are bound to high-affinity binding proteins, which not only modulate the bioavailability and signalling of IGFs but also have independent actions on cell growth and survival. The aim of this study was to investigate whether metformin modulates IGFs, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and the pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) - stanniocalcin 2 (STC2) axis.  Design and methods:   In a blinded, randomised, cross-over design, 15 patients with prostate cancer on stable ADT received metformin and placebo treatment for 6 weeks each. Glucose metabolism along with circulating IGFs and IGFBPs was assessed.  Results:   Metformin significantly reduced the homeostasis model assessment as an index of insulin resistance (HOMA IR) and hepatic insulin resistance. Metformin also reduced circulating IGF-2 (P < 0.05) and IGFBP-3 (P < 0.01) but increased IGF bioactivity (P < 0.05). At baseline, IGF-2 correlated significantly with the hepatic insulin resistance (r2= 0.28, P < 0.05). PAPP-A remained unchanged but STC2 declined significantly (P < 0.05) following metformin administration. During metformin treatment, change in HOMA IR correlated with the change in STC2 (r2= 0.35, P < 0.05).  Conclusion:   Metformin administration alters many components of the circulating IGF system, either directly or indirectly via improved insulin sensitivity. Reduction in IGF-2 and STC2 may provide a novel mechanism for a potential metformin-induced antineoplastic effect.""","""['Vita Birzniece', 'Teresa Lam', 'Mark McLean', 'Navneeta Reddy', 'Haleh Shahidipour', 'Amy Hayden', 'Howard Gurney', 'Glenn Stone', 'Rikke Hjortebjerg', 'Jan Frystyk']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Endocr Connect""","""['Metabolic improvement after gastric bypass correlates with changes in IGF-regulatory proteins stanniocalcin-2 and IGFBP-4.', 'The IGF system in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with prednisolone or infliximab: potential role of the stanniocalcin-2 / PAPP-A / IGFBP-4 axis.', 'Pregnancy-associated plasma proteins and Stanniocalcin-2 - Novel players controlling IGF-I physiology.', 'Novel Modulators of the Growth Hormone - Insulin-Like Growth Factor Axis: Pregnancy-Associated Plasma Protein-A2 and Stanniocalcin-2.', 'Insulin-like growth factor binding protein production in bovine retinal endothelial cells.', 'The development and benefits of metformin in various diseases.', 'Heritability and circulating concentrations of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A and stanniocalcin-2 in elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins.', 'Mechanisms of Prostate Cancer Cells Survival and Their Therapeutic Targeting.']"""

Here, for the very first time, we synthesized a library of fascaplysin derivatives covering all possible substituent introduction sites, i.e., cycles A, C and E of the 12H-pyrido[1-2-a:3,4-b']diindole system. Their selectivity towards human prostate cancer versus non-cancer cells, as well as the effects on cellular metabolism, membrane integrity, cell cycle progression, apoptosis induction and their ability to intercalate into DNA were investigated. A pronounced selectivity for cancer cells was observed for the family of di- and trisubstituted halogen derivatives (modification of cycles A and E), while a modification of cycle C resulted in a stronger activity in therapy-resistant PC-3 cells. Among others, 3,10-dibromofascaplysin exhibited the highest selectivity, presumably due to the cytostatic effects executed via the targeting of cellular metabolism. Moreover, an introduction of radical substituents at C-9, C-10 or C-10 plus C-3 resulted in a notable reduction in DNA intercalating activity and improved selectivity.

New techniques, such as stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) have been introduced with the motivation of improving therapeutic outcomes, with the consequence that the time dependence of the dose within a fraction is modified. Here, we test whether an increased toxicity to cancer cells arises when a radiation treatment fraction is delivered in two equal parts, allowing time for the expression of factors, for example, RONS and cytokines, in response to the first dose which may sensitize cells to the second dose. A medium time delay between 15 and 60 minutes is proposed to allow factors to be expressed before repair takes place. A grid field is used to enhance diffusion of the factors.  Materials and methods:   The cell lines used in the study were two prostate cancers (LNCaP and DU 145), a normal prostate (PNT1A), a non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H460), and a glioma (Hs 683). Uniform or spatially modulated grid fields, delivering the same mean dose, were used. The results for the clonogenic survival fractions were grouped into a 'short' delay (under 10 minutes) and a 'medium' delay (between 15 and 60 minutes).  Results:   The medium delay with a grid field yielded a significant increase in toxicity for the four cancer cell lines. The medium delay with a uniform field gave a significant increase in toxicity for the two prostate cancer cell lines. A highly significant increase was found in the therapeutic ratio, defined as the ratio of the survival of prostate normal to prostate cancer cells.  Conclusions:   The findings show that the intra-fractional dose schedule with medium time delay offers an opportunity to increase the toxicity of radiation to cancer cells, relative to a single radiation delivery. For all cancer cell lines, a grid field gives a greater toxic effect than a uniform field. The split dose treatment offers an increase in cancer toxicity while preserving normal cells, improving the outcomes of a treatment.""","""['Linda Joanne Rogers', 'Juliette Cornelia Harley', 'David Robert McKenzie', 'Natalka Suchowerska']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Biol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (mirage): a phase iii randomized trial.', 'A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.', 'Potential increase in biological effectiveness from field timing optimization for stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'Rectal radiation dose-reduction techniques in prostate cancer: a focus on the rectal spacer.', 'What is the best way to radiate the prostate in 2016?']"""

It is necessary to develop a prognostic nomogram for the prediction of overall survival (OS) in early-onset PCa patients.  Methods:   A total of 23,730 early-onset PCa patients (younger than 55 years old) between 2010 and 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were enrolled for the current study, and randomly separated into the training cohort and the validation cohort. 361 eligible early-onset PCa patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) cohort were obtained as the external validation cohort. Independent predictors were selected by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and a prognostic nomogram was constructed for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS. The accurate and discriminative abilities of the nomogram were evaluated by the concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration plot, net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).  Results:   Multivariate Cox analysis showed that race, marital status, TNM stage, prostate-specific antigen, Gleason score, and surgery were significantly associated with poor prognosis of PCa. A nomogram consisting of these variables was established, which had higher C-indexes than the TNM system (training cohort: 0.831 vs. 0.746, validation cohort: 0.817 vs. 0.752). Better AUCs of the nomogram than the TNM system at 1, 3, and 5 years were found in both the training cohort and the validation cohort. The 3-year and 5-year AUCs of the nomogram in the TCGA-PRAD cohort were 0.723 and 0.679, respectively. The calibration diagram, NRI, and IDI also showed promising prognostic value in OS.

Although the current anti-androgen therapy could significantly benefit prostate cancer patients initially, the efficacy of the single drug usually lasts for a relatively short period, as drug resistance quickly emerges.  Methods:   We have performed an unbiased bioinformatics analysis using the RNA-seq results in 22Rv1 cells to identify the cell response toward Dip G treatment. The RNA-seq results were validated by qRT-PCR. Protein levels were detected by western blot or staining. Cell viability was measured by Aquabluer and colony formation assay.  Results:   Here, we identified that Diptoindonesin G (Dip G), a natural extracted compound, could promote the proteasome degradation of AR and polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) through modulating the activation of CHIP E3 ligase. Administration of Dip G has shown a profound efficiency in the suppression of AR and PLK1, not only in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells but also in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant cells in a CHIP-dependent manner. Through co-targeting the AR signaling, Dip G robustly improved the efficacy of HSP90 inhibitors and enzalutamide in both human prostate cancer cells and in vivo xenograft mouse model.

Here, the authors perform single-cell RNA sequencing from 14 untreated PCa patients. They create an extensive cell atlas of the PCa patients and mapped developmental states onto tumor subclonal evolution. They identify distinct subclones across PCa patients and then stratify tumor cells into four transcriptional subtypes, EMT-like (subtype 0), luminal A-like (subtype 1), luminal B/C-like (subtype 2), and basal-like (subtype 3). These subtypes are hierarchically organized into stem cell-like and differentiated status. Strikingly, multiple subclones within a single primary tumor present with distinct combinations of preferential subtypes. In addition, subclones show different communication strengths with other cell types within the tumor ecosystem, which may modulate the distinct transcriptional subtypes of the subclones. Notably, by integrating TCGA data, they discover that both tumor cell transcriptional heterogeneity and cellular ecosystem diversity correlate with features of a poor prognosis.

RV and GV were measured using volume delineation. Toxicity data were collected.  Results:   264 CBCTs were analysed. RV and GV were not significantly different in the simethicone group compared with the control group at each time point (P >0.05) after adjusting for Week 0 values as a covariate. The simethicone group showed an average reduction in RV and GV of 10% and 21%, respectively, compared with the control group (P >0.05). Standard deviations were calculated over 10 time points, which were grouped to represent the first 2-3 weeks of radiation therapy versus subsequent weeks. These were not significantly different between the simethicone and control group. However, there was a statistically significant decrease in the variability of RV at time points 6-10 compared with time points 1-5 within the simethicone group (P = 0.012), but no significant difference was found between these grouped time points in the control group (P = 0.581). The toxicity questionnaires showed no significant difference between the groups.  Conclusions:   Simethicone did not decrease the RV or GV overall. However, simethicone appeared to significantly decrease the RV variability from Week three onwards. This suggests that taking simethicone two to three weeks before starting radiation therapy may reduce RV variability, although a larger study is needed to confirm this.""","""['Jennifer Ward', 'Suki Gill', 'Kevin Armstrong', 'Tamara Fogarty', 'Daren Tan', 'Alison Scott', 'Aylin Yahya', 'Satvinder Singh Dhaliwal', 'Angela Jacques', 'Colin Tang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['A study on planning organ at risk volume for the rectum using cone beam computed tomography in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'A feature alignment score for online cone-beam CT-based image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'The effect of bowel preparation regime on interfraction rectal filling variation during image guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Current status of intensity-modulated radiation therapy for prostate cancer: History, clinical results and future directions.', 'The influence of the bowel and bladder preparation protocol for radiotherapy of prostate cancer using kilo-voltage cone beam CT: Our experience.']"""

Epigenetic modifier abnormalities are becoming a driving event in PCa. The specific role of KMT2C, a histone methyltransferase that is frequently aberrant in various tumors, is poorly understood in PCa. This study aimed to reveal the potential carcinogenic role of KMT2C in PCa.  Methods:   We first examined the expression levels of KMT2C in prostate cancer tissues. Then, we assessed the function of KMT2C in prostate cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. To explore the mechanism of the biological consequences, RNA-seq and CHIP-qPCR were performed. We also analyzed the effects of overexpression of the KMT2C downstream genes CLDN8 and ITGAV to reverse the effects of KMT2C on prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Herein, we first confirmed KMT2C overexpression in PCa at the transcript and protein levels. Knocking down KMT2C in VCaP and LNCaP cells inhibited cell viability, colony formation, and migration. Consistently, stable KMT2C depletion effectively decreased tumor growth by approximately 70% in vivo. Mechanistically, the results suggested that CLDN8 and ITGAV are two key downstream genes of KMT2C and further regulate the MAPK/ERK and EMT pathways.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that KMT2C plays an oncogenic role in PCa. One of the mechanisms may be the epigenetic regulation of CLDN8 and ITGAV by KMT2C to modulate tumor-signaling pathways. Therefore, KMT2C may serve as a potential therapeutic target for PCa patients.""","""['Jianpo Lian#', 'Chengdang Xu#', 'Xi Chen', 'Shengsong Huang', 'Denglong Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Histone methyltransferase PRMT6 plays an oncogenic role of in prostate cancer.', 'Histone methyltransferase KMT2D sustains prostate carcinogenesis and metastasis via epigenetically activating LIFR and KLF4.', 'Down-regulation of human DAB2IP gene expression mediated by polycomb Ezh2 complex and histone deacetylase in prostate cancer.', 'βKlotho inhibits androgen/androgen receptor‑associated epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer through inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling.', 'The expanding role of epigenetics in the development, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Mutations in epigenetic regulator KMT2C detected by liquid biopsy are associated with worse survival in prostate cancer patients.', 'Comprehensive germline and somatic genomic profiles of Chinese patients with biliary tract cancer.']"""

Inhibition of AR activity in CD8 T cells prevented T cell exhaustion and improved responsiveness to PD-1 targeted therapy via increased IFNγ expression.

Glass slides from retrospective cohorts, some with patient follow-up data are digitised for the development and validation of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Such resources, therefore, become very important, with the need to ensure that their quality is of the standard necessary for downstream AI development. However, manual quality control of large cohorts of WSIs by visual assessment is unfeasible, and whilst quality control AI algorithms exist, these focus on bespoke aspects of image quality, e.g. focus, or use traditional machine-learning methods, which are unable to classify the range of potential image artefacts that should be considered. In this study, we have trained and validated a multi-task deep neural network to automate the process of quality control of a large retrospective cohort of prostate cases from which glass slides have been scanned several years after production, to determine both the usability of the images at the diagnostic level (considered in this study to be the minimal standard for research) and the common image artefacts present. Using a two-layer approach, quality overlays of WSIs were generated from a quality assessment (QA) undertaken at patch-level at [Formula: see text] magnification. From these quality overlays the slide-level quality scores were predicted and then compared to those generated by three specialist urological pathologists, with a Pearson correlation of 0.89 for overall 'usability' (at a diagnostic level), and 0.87 and 0.82 for focus and H&E staining quality scores respectively. To demonstrate its wider potential utility, we subsequently applied our QA pipeline to the TCGA prostate cancer cohort and to a colorectal cancer cohort, for comparison. Our model, designated as PathProfiler, indicates comparable predicted usability of images from the cohorts assessed (86-90% of WSIs predicted to be usable), and perhaps more significantly is able to predict WSIs that could benefit from an intervention such as re-scanning or re-staining for quality improvement.

Understanding the effect of specific experience in prostate MRI interpretation on diagnostic performance would help inform the minimum interpretation volume to establish proficiency. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to assess for an association between increasing experience in prostate MRI interpretation and change in radiologist-level PPVs for PI-RADS version 2 (v2) categories 3, 4, and 5. METHODS. This retrospective study included prostate MRI examinations performed between July 1, 2015, and August 13, 2021, that were assigned a PI-RADS v2 category of 3, 4, or 5 and with an MRI-ultrasound fusion biopsy available as the reference standard. All examinations were among the first 100-200 prostate MRI examinations interpreted using PI-RADS v2 by fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists. Radiologists received feedback through a quality assurance program. Radiologists' experience levels were classified using progressive subsets of 50 interpreted examinations. Change with increasing experience in distribution of individual radiologists' whole-gland PPVs for Gleason sum score 7 or greater prostate cancer, stratified by PI-RADS category, was assessed by hierarchic linear mixed models. RESULTS. The study included 1300 prostate MRI examinations in 1037 patients (mean age, 66 ± 7 [SD] years), interpreted by eight radiologists (median, 13 years of postfellow-ship experience; range, 5-22 years). Aggregate PPVs were 20% (68/340) for PI-RADS category 3, 49% (318/652) for category 4, and 71% (220/308) for category 5. Interquartile ranges (IQRs) of PPVs overlapped for category 4 (51%; IQR, 42-60%) and category 5 (70%; IQR, 54-75%) for radiologists' first 50 examinations. IQRs of PPVs did not overlap between categories of greater experience; for example, at the 101-150 examination level, PPV for category 3 was 24% (IQR, 20-29%), category 4 was 55% (IQR, 54-63%), and category 5 was 81% (IQR, 77-82%). Hierarchic modeling showed no change in radiologists' absolute PPV with increasing experience (category 3, p = .27; category 4, p = .71; category 5, p = .38). CONCLUSION. Absolute PPVs at specific PI-RADS categories did not change during radiologists' first 200 included examinations. However, resolution of initial overlap in IQRs indicates improved precision of PPVs after the first 50 examinations. CLINICAL IMPACT. If implementing a minimum training threshold for fellowship-trained abdominal radiologists, 50 prostate MRI examinations may be sufficient in the context of a quality assurance program with feedback.""","""['Bassel R Salka', 'Prasad R Shankar', 'Jonathan P Troost', 'Shokoufeh Khalatbari', 'Matthew S Davenport']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""AJR Am J Roentgenol""","""['Editorial Comment: What Is Prostate MRI Interpretation Experience?', 'Prostate Imaging and Data Reporting System Version 2 as a Radiology Performance Metric: An Analysis of 18 Abdominal Radiologists.', 'Utility of dual read in the setting of prostate MRI interpretation.', 'PI-RADS Versions 2 and 2.1: Interobserver Agreement and Diagnostic Performance in Peripheral and Transition Zone Lesions Among Six Radiologists.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting: A Review of Clinical Applications.']"""

PARPi treatment in prostate cancer (PC) is currently used as a monotherapy or in combination with standard therapies (hormonotherapy) in clinical trials for patients with DNA damage response mutation. Unfortunately, 20% of these patients did not respond to this new treatment. This resistance mechanism in PC is still not well understood. Here, we report that autophagy affects differently the response of PC cell lines to olaparib depending on its activation status. Pre-activation of autophagy before olaparib resulted in an increase of DNA repair activity by homologous recombination (HR) to repair double-strand breaks induced by olaparib and enhanced cell proliferation. When autophagy was activated after olaparib treatment, or completely inhibited, PC cells demonstrated an increased sensitivity to this PARPi. This autophagy-mediated resistance is, in part, regulated by the nuclear localization of sequestrosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62). Decrease of SQSTM1/p62 nuclear localization due to autophagy pre-activation leads to an increase of filamin A (FLNA) protein expression and BRCA1/Rad51 recruitment involved in the HR pathway.

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was performed with patients who underwent BNI for VUAS after RARP in a high-volume prostatectomy centre between 2006 and July 2021. Data was collected from patient charts. The cohort was divided into 4 groups: VUAS after (1) RARP-only, (2) RARP, but before salvage radiotherapy (SRT) (VUAS pre-SRT), (3) RARP and after SRT (VUAS post-SRT), and (4) primary radiotherapy and salvage RARP (SRARP). The VUAS recurrence rates, the ability to perform functional transurethral micturition and the post-BNI urinary continence rates were reported.  Results:   BNI was performed in 90 patients. The median time between first BNI and last follow-up was 32 months (interquartile range 10-58, range 0-171). The majority of VUAS occurred within 6 months after (S)RARP. In those who underwent BNI, recurrent VUAS was reported in 12%, 57%, 29%, and 50% of patients after RARP-only, VUAS pre-SRT, VUAS post-SRT, and SRARP, respectively. Ultimately, transurethral micturition was possible in 94%, 93%, 71%, and 80%, respectively.

We compared data from patients treated with 3-weekly, 75 mg/m2 docetaxel or 2-weekly, 50 mg/m2 docetaxel, including basal characteristics, predefined prognostic factors, treatment received, toxicity and survival data.  Results:   We included 200 patients, 86% of whom presented castration resistant mPC. A total of 158 patients (79%) were treated with 3-weekly scheme. Compared with these patients, patients treated with 2-weekly scheme were significantly older, had higher Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) and Charlson Comorbidity Index, presented more visceral metastases and needed opioid treatment more frequently. Patients treated with 2-weekly scheme presented shorter median overall survival; however, these differences were not shown after multivariate analysis with significant prognostic factors. Patients treated with 2-weekly scheme had more treatment delays and suspensions, but less clinically impairing toxicities such as febrile neutropenia, neuropathy and diarrhea; toxic deaths were 5 in the 3-weekly group while none in the 2-weekly group.

Identification of patients with underlying detrimental prostate cancer is paramount for tailored treatment decision-making, but guideline recommendations for this setting are lacking.  Objective:   To highlight clinical and histological characteristics related to BPO surgery that may predict IPCa with unfavorable pathology.  Design, setting, and participants:   We included men with IPCa who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) in the short term after IPCa diagnosis. Two cohorts were built according to final pathology for the RP specimen: unfavorable pathology (International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade group [GG] ≥3 and/or ≥pT3a and/or pN1) versus favorable pathology.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We performed multivariate regression analysis for the endpoint, which was unfavorable pathology for the RP specimen. Using the model estimates for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), ISUP GG, age, and prostate volume, we established a model for estimating the risk of unfavorable histopathology.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 112 patients were included in the final assessment. On multivariate analysis, PSA (odds ratio [OR] 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.003-1.170; p = 0.042), ISUP GG for the specimen from BPO surgery (OR 3.090; 95% CI 1.129-8.457; p = 0.028), and age (OR 1.121, 95% CI 1.026-1.225; p = 0.012) were independent predictors for unfavorable histopathology. On receiver operating characteristic analysis, the area under the curve was 0.751. A novel calculator was developed to predict adverse pathology for men with IPCa. The study is limited by its retrospective design.  Conclusions:   For men with IPCa, PSA before surgery for BPO, ISUP GG, and age are independent predictors of unfavorable disease.

We sought to delineate the impact of miR-346 on DNA damage, and its potential as a therapeutic agent.  Methods:   RNA-IP, RNA-seq, RNA-ISH, DNA fibre assays, in vivo xenograft studies and bioinformatics approaches were used alongside a novel method for amplification-free, single nucleotide-resolution genome-wide mapping of DNA breaks (INDUCE-seq).  Results:   miR-346 induces rapid and extensive DNA damage in PC cells - the first report of microRNA-induced DNA damage. Mechanistically, this is achieved through transcriptional hyperactivation, R-loop formation and replication stress, leading to checkpoint activation and cell cycle arrest. miR-346 also interacts with genome-protective lncRNA NORAD to disrupt its interaction with PUM2, leading to PUM2 stabilisation and its increased turnover of DNA damage response (DDR) transcripts. Confirming clinical relevance, NORAD expression and activity strongly correlate with poor PC clinical outcomes and increased DDR in biopsy RNA-seq studies. In contrast, miR-346 is associated with improved PC survival. INDUCE-seq reveals that miR-346-induced DSBs occur preferentially at binding sites of the most highly-transcriptionally active transcription factors in PC cells, including c-Myc, FOXA1, HOXB13, NKX3.1, and importantly, AR, resulting in target transcript downregulation. Further, RNA-seq reveals widespread miR-346 and shNORAD dysregulation of DNA damage, replication and cell cycle processes. NORAD drives target-directed miR decay (TDMD) of miR-346 as a novel genome protection mechanism: NORAD silencing increases mature miR-346 levels by several thousand-fold, and WT but not TDMD-mutant NORAD rescues miR-346-induced DNA damage. Importantly, miR-346 sensitises PC cells to DNA-damaging drugs including PARP inhibitor and chemotherapy, and induces tumour regression as a monotherapy in vivo, indicating that targeting miR-346:NORAD balance is a valid therapeutic strategy.  Conclusions:   A balancing act between miR-346 and NORAD regulates DNA damage and repair in PC. miR-346 may be particularly effective as a therapeutic in the context of decreased NORAD observed in advanced PC, and in transcriptionally-hyperactive cancer cells.""","""['C E Fletcher#', 'L Deng#', 'F Orafidiya#', 'W Yuan', 'M P G S Lorentzen', 'O W Cyran', 'A Varela-Carver', 'T A Constantin', 'D A Leach', 'F M Dobbs', 'I Figueiredo', 'B Gurel', 'E Parkes', 'D Bogdan', 'R R Pereira', 'S G Zhao', 'A Neeb', 'F Issa', 'J Hester', 'H Kudo', 'Y Liu', 'Y Philippou', 'R Bristow', 'K Knudsen', 'R J Bryant', 'F Y Feng', 'S H Reed', 'I G Mills', 'J de Bono', 'C L Bevan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Radiation induces NORAD expression to promote ESCC radiotherapy resistance via EEPD1/ATR/Chk1 signalling and by inhibiting pri-miR-199a1 processing and the exosomal transfer of miR-199a-5p.', 'Long non-coding RNA NORAD promotes the prostate cancer cell extracellular vesicle release via microRNA-541-3p-regulated PKM2 to induce bone metastasis of prostate cancer.', 'The long noncoding RNA noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD)-microRNA-496-Interleukin-33 axis affects carcinoma-associated fibroblasts-mediated gastric cancer development.', 'NORAD: Defender of the Genome.', 'Non-coding RNA Activated by DNA Damage: Review of Its Roles in the Carcinogenesis.', 'LncRNA weighted gene co-expression network analysis reveals novel biomarkers related to prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

Downregulated expression or activity of regucalcin contributes to the development of malignancies in various types of human cancer. Survival of cancer patients, including metastatic prostate cancer, is prolonged with high expression of regucalcin in the tumor tissues.  Methods:   We elucidate whether extracellular regucalcin conquers the growth, migration, invasion, and adhesion of metastatic human prostate cancer PC-3 and DU-145 cells.  Results:   Extracellular regucalcin (0.1, 1, and 10 nM) of physiologic levels (1 nM at human serum) inhibited colony formation and growth of PC-3 and DU-145 cells, while it did not have an effect on cell death. Repressive effects of extracellular regucalcin on the proliferation were not exhibited by the presence of inhibitors of the cell cycle, intracellular signaling process, and transcriptional activity, suggesting that the signals of extracellular regucalcin are transmitted to block cell growth. Furthermore, extracellular regucalcin (0.1, 1, or 10 nM) inhibited migration, invasion, and adhesion of PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Mechanistically, extracellular regucalcin (10 nM) decreased the levels of various signaling proteins including Ras, posphatidylinositol-3 kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, mechanistic target of rapamycin, RSK-2, caveolin-1, and integrin β1 in PC-3 cells.  Discussion and conclusion:   Thus, extracellular regucalcin may play a suppressive role in growth, migration, invasion, and adhesion, which are involved in the metastatic activity of human prostate cancer cells, via affecting diverse signaling processes.

Bioinformatics analysis reveals that EWI2 gene expression is up regulated in lung adenocarcinoma and higher expression of EWI2 mRNA may predict poorer overall survival. However, experimental analysis shows that EWI2 protein is actually downregulated constantly in the tissues of lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Forced expression of EWI2 in human lung adenocarcinoma cells reduces total cellular and cell surface levels of various integrins and growth factor receptors, which initiates the outside-in motogenic and mitogenic signaling. These reductions result in the decreases in 1) cell-matrix adhesion, cell movement, and cell transformation in vitro and 2) tumor growth, burden, and metastasis in vivo, and result from the increases in lysosomal trafficking and proteolytic degradation of theses membrane receptors. EWI2 elevates lysosome formation by promoting nuclear retention of TFEB, the master transcription factor driving lysosomogenesis. In conclusion, EWI2 as a lung cancer suppressor attenuates lung cancer cells in a comprehensive fashion by inhibiting both tumor growth and tumor metastasis; EWI2 as an endolysosome regulator promotes lysosome activity to enhance lysosomal degradation of growth factor receptors and integrins and then reduce their levels and functions; and EWI2 can become a promising therapeutic candidate given its accessibility at the cell surface, dual inhibition on growth factor receptors and integrins, and broad-spectrum anti-cancer activity.

Materials and methods:   The sample consisted of 40 prostate cancer patients, 22 of whom had undergone a radical prostatectomy. Urodynamic parameters before and after an average of 4.2 months of radiotherapy were measured and compared. External radiotherapy was administered via Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT), Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) techniques.  Results:   Uroflowmetry presented no significant parameters. In the case of Cystomanometry, the data did not show an increase in secondary stress urinary incontinence, although there is 7 percent increase in urge urinary incontinence. There were statistically significant changes in reduced bladder capacity with a strong desire to void, with an urge to void and also in the detrusor pressure with a normal desire to void. Furthermore, pressure/flow analysis revealed a statistically significant reduction of residual urine volume.  Conclusions:   The effect of prostatectomy and age varies according to the evolution of urodynamics. There was a significant reduction in terms of residual urine volume and detrusor pressure with a normal desire to void in patients without a prostatectomy and in those under 75 years old. In addition to an increase in urge incontinence, there was also a significant worsening of the bladder filling urodynamics and a decrease in the cystomanometric bladder capacity with a strong desire and an urge to void. None of these were modified by age or prostatectomy.""","""['J Casas-Nebra', 'B Blanco-Gomez', 'A Medina-González', 'I Formoso-Garcia', 'S Escaf-Barmadah', 'A Alvarez-Arenal']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Actas Urol Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Voiding patterns in patients with post-prostatectomy incontinence: urodynamic and demographic analysis.', 'Radical prostatectomy restores detrusor contraction pattern according to pressure flow parameters.', 'Predictors of de novo urge urinary incontinence after photoselective vaporization of the prostate.', 'The etiology of post-radical prostatectomy incontinence and correlation of symptoms with urodynamic findings.', 'Recommendations for the urodynamic examination in the investigation of non-neurological female urinary incontinence.']"""

Rapid extension of robot-assisted, minimally invasive surgery has increased the need to make PSMA-radioguided surgery (RGS) robot-compliant.  Objective:   To evaluate whether the miniaturized DROP-IN gamma probe facilitates translation of PSMA-RGS to robotic surgery in men with recurrent PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective feasibility study included 20 patients with up to three pelvic PCa recurrences (nodal or local) on staging PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) after previous curative-intent therapy.  Surgical procedure:   Robot-assisted PSMA-RGS using the DROP-IN gamma probe was carried out 19-23 h after intravenous injection of 99mtechnetium PSMA-Investigation & Surgery (99mTc-PSMA-I&S).  Measurements:   The primary endpoint was the feasibility of robot-assisted PSMA-RGS. Secondary endpoints were a comparison of the radioactive status (positive or negative) of resected specimens and final histopathology results, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response following PSMA-RGS, and complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification.  Results and limitations:   Using the DROP-IN probe, 19/21 (90%) PSMA-avid lesions could be resected robotically. On a per-lesion basis, the sensitivity and specificity of robot-assisted PSMA-RGS was 86% and 100%, respectively. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction of >50% and a complete biochemical response (PSA <0.2 ng/ml) were seen in 12/18 (67%) and 4/18 (22%) patients, respectively. During follow-up of up to 15 mo, 4/18 patients (22%) remained free of biochemical recurrence (PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml). One patient suffered from a Clavien-Dindo grade >III complication.  Conclusions:   The DROP-IN probe helps in realizing robot-assisted PSMA-RGS. The procedure is technically feasible for intraoperative detection of nodal or local PSMA-avid PCa recurrences.  Patient summary:   A device called the DROP-IN probe facilitates minimally invasive, robot-assisted surgery guided by radioactive tracers in patients with recurrent prostate cancer. This procedure holds promise for improving the intraoperative identification and removal of prostate cancer lesions.""","""['Hilda A de Barros', 'Matthias N van Oosterom', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Jeroen J M A Hendrikx', 'André N Vis', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Pim J van Leeuwen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['99mTechnetium-based Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-radioguided Surgery in Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen Radioguided Surgery to Detect Nodal Metastases in Primary Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection: Results of a Planned Interim Analysis of a Prospective Phase 2 Study.', 'Robot-Assisted Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Radioguided Surgery in Primary Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.', 'PSMA-radioguided surgery in localised recurrent prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'The current status of prostate cancer treatment and PSMA theranostics.', 'Sentinel Node Procedure to Select Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer Patients with Occult Nodal Metastases for Whole Pelvis Radiotherapy.', 'Development of in-House Synthesis and Quality Control of 99mTcTc-PSMA-I&S.', 'Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of novel 99mTc-labeled PSMA ligands for radioguided surgery of prostate cancer.', 'Robot-assisted vs. laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis based on comparative studies.']"""

RhoA has been shown to play a vital role in carcinogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. However, the role of RhoA in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear.  Objectives:   This study investigated the role of RhoA and the associated mechanisms of RhoA depletion in enzalutamide resistance in CRPC.  Methods:   Western blotting, 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and colony formation assays were used to assess protein expression, survival, and proliferation of PCa cells, respectively. Xenograft experiments and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining were used to detect further effects of RhoA on enzalutamide resistance in vivo.  Results:   In the present study, the expression of RhoA, ROCK2, p38, p-p38, and AR was upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells treated with enzalutamide, and silencing of RhoA or ROCK2 attenuated enzalutamide-resistant cell proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, the deletion of RhoA dramatically increased the efficacy of enzalutamide in inhibiting 22RV1-derived xenograft tumor growth. Additionally, there was no significant change in ROCK1 expression in C4-2R cells treated with or without enzalutamide. Mechanistically, the knockdown of RhoA expression reverted the resistance to enzalutamide via RhoA/ROCK2/p38 rather than RhoA/ROCK1/p38.  Conclusion:   Our results suggested that RhoA is a promising therapeutic target. As the inhibition of RhoA reverted enzalutamide resistance, it may increase its effectiveness in CRPC.""","""['Xiaoliang Chen', 'Lili Yin', 'Hui Xu', 'Jie Rong', 'Miao Feng', 'Di Jiang', 'Yunfeng Bai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Recent Pat Anticancer Drug Discov""","""['Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination of phospholipase Cε knockdown with GANT61 sensitizes castration‑resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide by suppressing the androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

However, it remains a challenging task for various reasons, including a missing or ambiguous boundary between the prostate and surrounding tissues, the presence of shadow artifacts, intra-prostate intensity heterogeneity, and anatomical variations.  Methods:   Here, we present a hybrid method for prostate segmentation (H-ProSeg) in TRUS images, using a small number of radiologist-defined seed points as the prior points. This method consists of three subnetworks. The first subnetwork uses an improved principal curve-based model to obtain data sequences consisting of seed points and their corresponding projection index. The second subnetwork uses an improved differential evolution-based artificial neural network for training to decrease the model error. The third subnetwork uses the parameters of the artificial neural network to explain the smooth mathematical description of the prostate contour. The performance of the H-ProSeg method was assessed in 55 brachytherapy patients using Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard similarity coefficient (Ω), and accuracy (ACC) values.  Results:   The H-ProSeg method achieved excellent segmentation accuracy, with DSC, Ω, and ACC values of 95.8%, 94.3%, and 95.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the DSC, Ω, and ACC values of the proposed method were as high as 93.3%, 91.9%, and 93%, respectively, due to the influence of Gaussian noise (standard deviation of Gaussian function, σ = 50). Although the σ increased from 10 to 50, the DSC, Ω, and ACC values fluctuated by a maximum of approximately 2.5%, demonstrating the excellent robustness of our method.  Conclusions:   Here, we present a hybrid method for accurate and robust prostate ultrasound image segmentation. The H-ProSeg method achieved superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art techniques. The knowledge of precise boundaries of the prostate is crucial for the conservation of risk structures. The proposed models have the potential to improve prostate cancer diagnosis and therapeutic outcomes.""","""['Tao Peng', 'Yiyun Wu', 'Jing Qin', 'Qingrong Jackie Wu', 'Jing Cai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'A deep learning method for real-time intraoperative US image segmentation in prostate brachytherapy.', 'Label-driven magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) registration using weakly supervised learning for MRI-guided prostate radiotherapy.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.']"""

This study seeks to quantify the advantages of MV-kV tracking over kV imaging alone through a retrospective analysis of over 300 patients who underwent prostate SBRT treatment using MV-kV tracking.  Methods:   An MV-kV imaging-based fiducial tracking technique has been developed at our institute and become a standard clinical practice. This technique calculates three-dimensional (3D) fiducial displacement in real time from orthogonal kV and MV images acquired simultaneously. The patient will be repositioned if for two consecutive MV-kV data points, the motion is larger than a tolerance of 1.5 mm in any of the lateral, superior-inferior, and/or anterior-posterior directions. This study retrospectively analyzed detected 3D motions using an MV-kV approach of 324 patients who recently underwent prostate SBRT treatments. An algorithm was developed to recover the 2D motion components as if they were detected by kV or MV imaging alone.  Results:   Our results indicated that out-of-tolerance motions were primarily limited to the range of 1.5-3 mm (>95%). The motions are primarily anterior-posterior and superior-inferior, with less than 14.8% of the occurrences in the lateral direction. Compared to out-of-tolerance occurrences detected by MV-kV approach, kV alone caught 46.6% of motions in all three directions, and MV alone caught 46.7%. kV alone shows an overall missing rate of 45.8% for superior-inferior motions and 38.6% for lateral motions. It is also demonstrated that the detectability of motion in specific directions greatly depends on gantry angles, as does the missing rate.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrated that MV-kV imaging-based intrafraction motion tracking is superior to single kV imaging for prostate SBRT in clinical practice.""","""['Kevin Crotteau', 'Wei Lu', 'Sean Berry', 'Laura Happersett', 'Sarah Burleson', 'Weixing Cai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Markerless motion tracking with simultaneous MV and kV imaging in spine SBRT treatment-a feasibility study.', 'Prostate SBRT With Intrafraction Motion Management Using a Novel Linear Accelerator-Based MV-kV Imaging Method.', 'The first clinical implementation of a real-time six degree of freedom target tracking system during radiation therapy based on Kilovoltage Intrafraction Monitoring (KIM).', 'Intrafraction 4D-cone beam CT acquired during volumetric arc radiotherapy delivery: kV parameter optimization and 4D motion accuracy for lung stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) patients.', 'Sequential monoscopic image-guided motion compensation in tomotherapy stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer.', 'Dynamic intrafractional position monitoring with implanted fiducial markers for enhanced accuracy in radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'Markerless motion tracking with simultaneous MV and kV imaging in spine SBRT treatment-a feasibility study.']"""

Thus, newer alternatives with fewer side effects are urgently needed. Animal and human studies suggest the therapeutic potential of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) for PC. To test this possibility, Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2) trial was conducted in PC patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after local treatment to determine the effect of a 6-month LCD intervention vs. usual care control on PC growth as measured by PSA doubling time (PSADT). We previously reported the LCD intervention led to significant weight loss, higher HDL, and lower triglycerides and HbA1c with a suggested longer PSADT. However, the metabolic basis of these effects are unknown.  Methods:   To identify the potential metabolic basis of effects of LCD on PSADT, serum metabolomic analysis was performed using baseline, month 3, and month 6 banked sera to identify the metabolites significantly altered by LCD and that correlated with varying PSADT.  Results:   LCD increased the serum levels of ketone bodies, glycine and hydroxyisocaproic acid. Reciprocally, LCD reduced the serum levels of alanine, cytidine, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and 2-oxobutanoate. As high ADMA level is shown to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) signaling and contribute to various cardiovascular diseases, the ADMA repression under LCD may contribute to the LCD-associated health benefit. Regression analysis of the PSADT revealed a correlation between longer PSADT with higher level of 2-hydroxybutyric acids, ketone bodies, citrate and malate. Longer PSADT was also associated with LCD reduced nicotinamide, fructose-1, 6-biphosphate (FBP) and 2-oxobutanoate.  Conclusion:   These results suggest a potential association of ketogenesis and TCA metabolites with slower PC growth and conversely glycolysis with faster PC growth. The link of high ketone bodies with longer PSADT supports future studies of ketogenic diets to slow PC growth.""","""['Jen-Tsan Chi', 'Pao-Hwa Lin', 'Vladimir Tolstikov', 'Lauren Howard', 'Emily Y Chen', 'Valerie Bussberg', 'Bennett Greenwood', 'Niven R Narain', 'Michael A Kiebish', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['The effects of diet on prostate cancer outcomes.', 'A Randomized Controlled Trial of a 6-Month Low-Carbohydrate Intervention on Disease Progression in Men with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2).', 'Weight loss via a low-carbohydrate diet improved the intestinal permeability marker, zonulin, in prostate cancer patients.', 'The influence of low-carbohydrate diets on the metabolic response to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.', 'The Low-Carbohydrate Diet: Short-Term Metabolic Efficacy Versus Longer-Term Limitations.', 'Markers and meaning of primary treatment failure.', 'A healthy diet, a healthy prostate?

Iron-containing ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, such as ferumoxtran-10, are not contraindicated in these patients. Thus, patients with renal failure can still undergo angiography with ferumoxtran-10.  Objective:   To evaluate the visibility of pelvic vessels with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) using ferumoxtran-10 as contrast agent.  Design, setting, and participants:   Three hundred and eighty-one patients diagnosed with primary or recurrent prostate cancer underwent pelvic ferumoxtran-10 MRA. Eleven anatomical pelvic-vessel segments per patient were evaluated using qualitative and quantitative criteria for image quality (IQ), vessel visibility (VV), and the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).  Intervention:   Ferumoxtran-10-enhaced MRA.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   IQ, VV, and CNR were assessed on a 5-point scale for each data set/vessel segment (very poor, poor, moderate, good, and excellent).  Results and limitations:   IQ was good to excellent for 98.2% of the data sets and VV was good to excellent for 97.7% of all vessel segments. The mean CNR for all segments was 88.13 (standard deviation 4.22). Contrast bolus imaging cannot be performed with this technique, so it is impossible to visualize the arterial or venous phase separately. The timing of contrast administration is also a limitation, with MRA performed 1 d after contrast infusion.  Conclusions:   Ferumoxtran-10 MRA showed excellent image quality and visibility for pelvic vessels. In addition, the homogeneity of the intraluminal contrast was superior. Patients with preterminal or terminal renal function can benefit from ferumoxtran-10 MRA if visualization of their pelvic vessels is required.

We aimed to explore the feasibility and potential utility of CGP in mCSPC.  Patients and methods:   Patients with mCSPC were prospectively recruited at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre to the OCTANE trial (NCT02906943). The objective was to assess the feasibility of profiling archival standard diagnostic tumor tissue using next generation sequencing with a custom hybridization capture DNA-based or a targeted DNA/RNA amplicon-based panel. Clinical data were extracted from electronic health records.  Results:   Among 39 mCSPC patients enrolled, 21 (54%) had sufficient archival tissue for CGP. Most had high volume (71%) or de novo (71%) mCSPC, with the majority being androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) naïve. In total, 62% of patients had a pathogenic and/or a likely pathogenic variant, many of which involved DNA damage repair (DDR, 19%), cell cycle (24%), and Androgen Receptor (AR, 10%) pathways. After median follow-up of 32.1 months, 18 of 21 patients progressed, with median time to mCRPC of 14.3 months (95% CI 10.2-21.0).

It is our goal to determine how to optimally target the underlying histopathological cancer within the setting of high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT).  Methods and materials:   Ten prostatectomy patients had pathologist-annotated mid-gland histology registered to pre-procedural mpMRI, which were interpreted by four different observers. Simulated HDR-BT plans with realistic catheter placements were generated by registering the mpMRI lesions and corresponding histology annotations to previously performed clinical HDR-BT implants. Inverse treatment planning was used to generate treatment plans that treated the entire gland to a single dose of 15 Gy, as well as focally targeted plans that aimed to escalate dose to the mpMRI lesions to 20.25 Gy. Three margins to the lesion were explored: 0 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm. The analysis compared the dose that would have been delivered to the corresponding histologically-defined cancer with the different treatment planning techniques.  Results:   mpMRI-targeted plans delivered a significantly higher dose to the histologically-defined cancer (p < 0.001), in comparison to the standard treatment plans. Additionally, adding a 1 mm margin resulted in significantly higher D98, and D90 to the histologically-defined cancer in comparison to the 0 mm margin targeted plans (p = 0.019 & p = 0.0026). There was no significant difference between plans using 1 mm and 2 mm margins.

Multiple reaction monitoring was used to quantify ARV-110 and pomalidomide with ion transitions at m/z 813.4 → 452.2 and 273.8 → 201.0, respectively. The developed method showed good linearity in the concentration range of 2-3000 ng/mL with acceptable accuracy, precision, matrix effect, process efficiency, and recovery.

Furthermore, the elimination of ARV-110 via phase 1 metabolism in rat, mouse, and human hepatic microsomes was shown to be unlikely. Application of the developed method to pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the oral bioavailability of ARV-110 in rats and mice was moderate (23.83% and 37.89%, respectively).

Secondly, we evaluated the influence of the combinations on genotoxicity of model mutagens, 4-nitroquinoline oxide (4NQO) and 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), in the umu test. All combinations of isoflavonoids and minerals inhibited prostate cancer cells growth. However, only mixtures with iron ions had significantly stronger effect than the phytochemicals. Interestingly, we observed that only genistein attenuated genotoxicity of 4NQO. The addition of any tested mineral abolished this effect. All tested isoflavonoids had anti-genotoxic activity against 2AA, which was significantly enhanced in the presence of copper sulphate. Our results indicate that the tested minerals in physiological concentrations had minimal influence on the anti-proliferative activity of isoflavonoids.

MISt is a minimally invasive fixation procedure that temporarily stabilizes the spine, thereby reducing pain, preventing pathological fractures, and improving activities of daily living at an early stage. MISt may be useful given the recent shift toward outpatient cancer treatment. Materials and Methods: This study enrolled 51 patients with metastatic spinal tumors who underwent surgery using MISt between December 2013 and October 2020. The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score, an assessment of spinal instability, was used to determine the indication for surgery, and the Epidural Spinal Cord Compression scale was used for additional decompression. Results: The patients comprised 34 men and 17 women, and the mean age at surgery was 68.9 years. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 20.8 months, and 35 of 51 patients (67%) had died by the last survey. The mean operative time was 159.8 min, mean blood loss was 115.7 mL, and mean time to ambulation was 3.2 days. No perioperative complications were observed, although two patients required refixation surgery. Preoperatively, 37 patients (72.5%) were classified as Frankel grade E. There were no cases of postoperative exacerbation, and six patients showed improvement of one or more Frankel grades after surgery. The median duration of patient survival was about 22.0 months. Patients with breast, prostate, renal, and thyroid cancers had a good prognosis, whereas those with gastrointestinal and head and neck cancers had a poor prognosis. Conclusions: MISt can benefit patients who are ineligible for conventional, highly invasive surgery and is also suitable because cancer treatment is increasingly performed on an outpatient basis. Furthermore, choosing the right surgery for the right patient at the right time can significantly affect life expectancy.""","""['Kazuo Nakanishi', 'Kazuya Uchino', 'Seiya Watanabe', 'Kosuke Misaki', 'Hideaki Iba']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Clinical Results of Minimally Invasive Spine Stabilization for the Management of Metastatic Spinal Tumors Based on the Epidural Spinal Cord Compression Scale.', 'Impairment-driven cancer rehabilitation in patients with neoplastic spinal cord compression using minimally invasive spine stabilization.', 'The surgical management of metastatic spinal tumors based on an Epidural Spinal Cord Compression (ESCC) scale.', 'Minimally invasive percutaneous fixation techniques for metastatic spinal disease.', 'Therapy progress of spinal cord compression by metastatic spinal tumor.', 'Bone Fusion Morphology after Circumferential Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery Using Lateral Lumbar Interbody Fusion and Percutaneous Pedicle Screws without Bone Grafting in the Thoracic Spine: A Retrospective Study.', 'A New Treatment Algorithm That Incorporates Minimally Invasive Surgery for Pyogenic Spondylodiscitis in the Thoracic and Lumbar Spines: The Results of Its Clinical Application to a Series of 34 Patients.']"""

Oxidative stress caused by radiation-mediated mitochondrial damage is one of the major contributors to fibrosis. As diabetics are oxidatively stressed, radiation-mediated reactive oxygen species cause severe treatment failure, treatment-related side effects, and significantly reduced survival for diabetic prostate cancer patients as compared to non-diabetic prostate cancer patients. Hyperglycemia and enhanced mitochondrial damage significantly contribute to oxidative damage and disease progression after radiation therapy among diabetic prostate cancer patients. Therefore, reduction of mitochondrial damage in normal prostate fibroblasts after radiation should improve the overall clinical state of diabetic prostate cancer patients. We previously reported that MnTE-2-PyP, a manganese porphyrin, reduces oxidative damage in irradiated hyperglycemic prostate fibroblasts by scavenging superoxide and activating NRF2. In the current study, we have investigated the potential role of MnTE-2-PyP to protect mitochondrial health in irradiated hyperglycemic prostate fibroblasts. This study revealed that hyperglycemia and radiation increased mitochondrial ROS via blocking the mitochondrial electron transport chain, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and reduced mitochondrial biogenesis. Increased mitochondrial damage preceeded an increase in myofibroblast differentiation. MnTE-2-PyP reduced myofibroblast differentiation, improved mitochondrial health by releasing the block on the mitochondrial electron transport chain, enhanced ATP production efficiency, and restored mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism in the irradiated-hyperglycemic prostate fibroblasts. Therefore, we are proposing that one of the mechanisms that MnTE-2-PyP protects prostate fibroblasts from irradiation and hyperglycemia-mediated damage is by protecting the mitochondrial health in diabetic prostate cancer patients.""","""['Arpita Chatterjee', 'Isin T Sakallioglu', 'Divya Murthy', 'Elizabeth A Kosmacek', 'Pankaj K Singh', 'J Tyson McDonald', 'Robert Powers', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Redox Biol""","""['MnTE-2-PyP, a manganese porphyrin, reduces cytotoxicity caused by irradiation in a diabetic environment through the induction of endogenous antioxidant defenses.', 'Manganese porphyrin, MnTE-2-PyP, treatment protects the prostate from radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF) by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway and enhancing SOD2 and sirtuin activity.', 'MnTE-2-PyP Treatment, or NOX4 Inhibition, Protects against Radiation-Induced Damage in Mouse Primary Prostate Fibroblasts by Inhibiting the TGF-Beta 1 Signaling Pathway.', 'Mn-porphyrins as novel molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents.', 'The role of mitochondrial oxidative stress and the tumor microenvironment in radiation-related cancer.', 'Energy stress modulation of AMPK/FoxO3 signaling inhibits mitochondria-associated ferroptosis.', 'Nucleotide metabolism: a pan-cancer metabolic dependency.', 'Multiomics Approach Captures Hepatic Metabolic Network Altered by Chronic Ethanol Administration.']"""

These unique features remain unexplained because of the poor structural and functional characterization of this tissue. This study characterized the structural organization of PPAT in patients compared with abdominopelvic adipose tissue (APAT), an extraperitoneal adipose depot, the accumulation of which is correlated to body mass index. Confocal microscopy followed by three-dimensional reconstructions showed a sparse vascular network in PPAT when compared with that in APAT, suggesting that this tissue is hypoxic. Unbiased comparisons of PPAT and APAT transcriptomes found that most differentially expressed genes were related to the hypoxia response. High levels of the hypoxia-inducible factor 2α confirmed the presence of an adaptive response to hypoxia in PPAT.

Many gene expression signatures have been developed to improve the risk stratification of prostate cancer and some of them have already been applied to clinical practice. However, no comprehensive evaluation has been performed to compare the performance of these signatures. In this study, we conducted a systematic and unbiased evaluation of 15 machine learning (ML) algorithms and 30 published prostate cancer gene expression-based prognostic signatures leveraging 10 transcriptomics datasets with 1,558 primary patients with prostate cancer from public data repositories. This analysis revealed that survival analysis models outperformed binary classification models for risk assessment, and the performance of the survival analysis methods-Cox model regularized with ridge penalty (Cox-Ridge) and partial least squares (PLS) regression for Cox model (Cox-PLS)-were generally more robust than the other methods. Based on the Cox-Ridge algorithm, several top prognostic signatures displayed comparable or even better performance than commercial panels. These findings will facilitate the identification of existing prognostic signatures that are promising for further validation in prospective studies and promote the development of robust prognostic models to guide clinical decision-making. Moreover, this study provides a valuable data resource from large primary prostate cancer cohorts, which can be used to develop, validate, and evaluate novel statistical methodologies and molecular signatures to improve prostate cancer management.

Therefore, the present study aimed to uncover the role of GATA binding protein 5 (GATA5)-mediated activation of TMEM100 in the proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa cells. The expressions of TMEM100 and GATA5 in PCa patients were analyzed by the GEPIA database. The binding site of GATA5 and TMEM100 promoter was predicted by the JASPAR database. Expressions of TMEM100 and GATA5 in PCa cells were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell Counting Kit 8 and colony formation assays were performed to measure cell proliferation. In addition, cell migration, invasion and the expression of EMT-associated proteins were evaluated using wound healing, transwell assay and Western blotting assays, respectively. The bioinformatics analysis revealed that TMEM100 was downregulated in PCa and was associated with overall survival of PCa. In addition, TMEM10 overexpression attenuated cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT in PCa cells. The interaction between TMEM100 and GATA5 was verified using dual luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, the results showed that GATA5 was downregulated and GATA5 silencing reversed the inhibitory effects of TMEM10 on PCa cells. Overall, the current study suggested that the GATA5-mediated transcriptional activation of TMEM100 could affect the behavior of PCa cells and was associated with poor prognosis in PCa.""","""['Jiaolin Liu', 'Fanlu Lin', 'Xin Wang', 'Chaopeng Li', 'Qiangyuan Qi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioengineered""","""['The Role of a Lung Vascular Endothelium Enriched Gene TMEM100.', 'TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'GATA binding protein 5 (GATA5) induces Rho GTPase activating protein 9 (ARHGAP9) to inhibit the malignant process of lung adenocarcinoma cells.', 'ARPC5 is transcriptionally activated by KLF4, and promotes cell migration and invasion in prostate cancer via up-regulating ADAM17 : ARPC5 serves as an oncogene in prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'The Role of a Lung Vascular Endothelium Enriched Gene TMEM100.', 'Transmembrane Protein 100 Inhibits the Progression of Colorectal Cancer by Promoting the Ubiquitin/Proteasome Degradation of HIF-1α.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate treatment class-specific outcomes of patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) vs taxane chemotherapy by tumor mutational burden (TMB).  Design, setting, and participants:   This comparative effectiveness analysis of clinical variables and outcomes used prospectively defined biomarker-stratified genomic data from a deidentified clinicogenomic database. Data included men with previously treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving ICI or single-agent taxane chemotherapy from January 2011 to April 2021 at approximately 280 US academic or community-based cancer clinics (approximately 800 sites of care). Data were analyzed from July to August 2021.  Exposures:   Single-agent ICI or single-agent taxanes. Treatments were assigned at discretion of physician and patient without randomization. Imbalances of known factors between treatment groups were adjusted with propensity weighting.  Main outcomes and measures:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, time to next therapy (TTNT), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   A total of 741 men (median [IQR], 70 [64-76] years) with mCRPC received comprehensive genomic profiling and were treated with ICI or single-agent taxane therapy. At baseline, the median (IQR) PSA level was 79.4 (19.0-254) ng/mL, 108 men (18.8%) had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status scores of 2 or greater, and 644 men (86.9%) had received prior systemic treatments for mCRPC. A total of 45 patients (6.1%) received ICI therapy and 696 patients (93.9%) received taxane therapy. Among patients with TMB of fewer than 10 mutations per megabase (mt/Mb) receiving ICI, compared with those receiving taxanes, had worse TTNT (median [IQR], 2.4 [1.1-3.2] months vs 4.1 [2.2-6.3] months; hazard ratio [HR], 2.65; 95% CI, 1.78-3.95; P < .001). In contrast, for patients with TMB of 10 mt/Mb or greater, use of ICIs, compared with use taxanes, was associated with more favorable TTNT (median [IQR], 8.0 [3.4 to unknown] months vs 2.4 [2.4-7.3] months; HR, 0.37, 95% CI, 0.15-0.87; P = .02) and OS (median 19.9 [8.06 to unknown] months vs 4.2 [2.69 - 6.12] months; HR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.10-0.57; P = .001). Among all 741 patients, 44 (5.9%) had TMB of 10 mt/Mb or greater, 22 (3.0%) had high microsatellite instability, and 20 (2.7%) had both. Treatment interactions with TMB of 10 mt/Mb or greater (TTNT: HR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.32-0.31; P < .001; OS: HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.076-0.81; P = .02) were stronger than high microsatellite instability alone (TTNT: HR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.03-0.51; P = .004; OS: HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.13-1.12; P = .08).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this comparative effectiveness study, ICIs were more effective than taxanes in patients with mCRPC when TMB was 10 mt/Mb or greater but not when TMB was fewer than 10 mt/Mb. The results add validity to the existing TMB cutoff of 10 mt/Mb for ICI use in later lines of therapy, and suggest that ICIs may be a viable alternative to taxane chemotherapy for patients with mCRPC with high TMB.""","""['Ryon P Graf', 'Virginia Fisher', 'Janick Weberpals', 'Ole Gjoerup', 'Marni B Tierno', 'Richard S P Huang', 'Nicolas Sayegh', 'Douglas I Lin', 'Kira Raskina', 'Alexa B Schrock', 'Eric Severson', 'James F Haberberger', 'Jeffrey S Ross', 'James Creeden', 'Mia A Levy', 'Brian M Alexander', 'Geoffrey R Oxnard', 'Neeraj Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Errors in Figures.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors vs Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With Measures of Microsatellite Instability, Mismatch Repair, or Tumor Mutational Burden.', 'Predictive Genomic Biomarkers of Hormonal Therapy Versus Chemotherapy Benefit in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Real-world Validation of TMB and Microsatellite Instability as Predictive Biomarkers of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Effectiveness in Advanced Gastroesophageal Cancer.', 'Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, and Beyond.', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Promising Treatment Option for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer?', 'Establishment of cancer-associated fibroblasts-related subtypes and prognostic index for prostate cancer through single-cell and bulk RNA transcriptome.', 'A phase I prospective, non-randomized trial of autologous dendritic cell-based cryoimmunotherapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Progression in immunotherapy for advanced prostate cancer.', 'Comparative Effectiveness of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors vs Chemotherapy in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer With Measures of Microsatellite Instability, Mismatch Repair, or Tumor Mutational Burden.', 'The Current and Future Promises of Combination Radiation and Immunotherapy for Genitourinary Cancers.']"""

Methods:   This is a population-based cohort of individuals with incident cancer, diagnosed between 2013 and 2017 in Victoria. Data linkages were performed between the Victorian Cancer Registry and Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Dataset. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had RTU12. For the three most common cancers (i.e., prostate, breast and lung cancer), the time trend in RTU12 and factors associated with RTU12 were evaluated.  Results:   The overall RTU12 in our study cohort was 26-20% radical RT and 6% palliative RT. Of the 21,735 men with prostate cancer, RTU12 was 17%, with no significant change over time (P-trend = 0.53). In multivariate analyses, increasing age and lower socioeconomic status were independently associated with higher RTU12 for prostate cancer. Of the 20,883 women with breast cancer, RTU12 was 64%, which increased from 62% in 2013 to 65% in 2017 (P-trend < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, age, socioeconomic status and area of residency were independently associated with RTU12 for breast cancer. Of the 13,093 patients with lung cancer, RTU12 was 42%, with no significant change over time (P-trend = 0.16). In multivariate analyses, younger age, male and lower socioeconomic status were independently associated with higher RTU12.

As a result, golf might be a good way for prostate cancer survivors who have been fully vaccinated against coronavirus disease to improve their musculoskeletal function, cardiorespiratory fitness, psychological function, and general quality of life. Aerobic activity's ability to adjust hormone levels, prevent obesity, increase immunological function, and lower oxidative stress have all been identified as reasons for its benefit for prostate cancer survivors. Prostate cancer survivors must first complete a fitness evaluation supervised and recommended by a certified clinical exercise physiologist after consultations with a urologic oncologist before enrolling in a cancer-specific community golf program. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing is currently the gold standard technique for the evaluation of cardiopulmonary fitness. Prostate cancer survivors should be placed in a group with regard to their fitness level if they pass this fitness test. Prostate cancer survivors can be grouped into four to five groups at a time. Golfing activities should include warm-up, driving range, and course activities (on-course golf play twice a week for a duration of 90 min per day or 180 min per week at moderate-intensity).

Studies seeking to determine whether AR-V7 is a partial mimic of the AR, or also has unique activities, and whether the AR-V7 cistrome contains unique binding sites have yielded conflicting results. One limitation in many studies has been the low level of AR variant compared to AR. Here, LNCaP and VCaP cell lines in which AR-V7 expression can be induced to match the level of AR, were used to compare the activities of AR and AR-V7. The two AR isoforms shared many targets, but overall had distinct transcriptomes. Optimal induction of novel targets sometimes required more receptor isoform than classical targets such as PSA. The isoforms displayed remarkably different cistromes with numerous differential binding sites. Some of the unique AR-V7 sites were located proximal to the transcription start sites (TSS). A de novo binding motif similar to a half ARE was identified in many AR-V7 preferential sites and, in contrast to conventional half ARE sites that bind AR-V7, FOXA1 was not enriched at these sites.

However, despite being effective against hematologic malignancies, its success in solid tumors, where cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions play essential roles, remains elusive.  Methods:   Here, we studied the effects of MLN4924 on cell growth, migration and invasion in cultured prostate cancer cells and in disease-relevant prostate tumoroids. Using focused protein profiling, drug and RNAi screening, we analyzed cellular pathways activated by neddylation inhibition.  Results:   We show that mechanical stress induced by MLN4924 in prostate cancer cells significantly affects the therapeutic outcome. The latter depends on the cell type and involves distinct Rho isoforms. In LNCaP and VCaP cells, the stimulation of RhoA and RhoB by MLN4924 markedly upregulates the level of tight junction proteins at cell-cell contacts, which augments the mechanical strain induced by Rho signaling. This ""tight junction stress response"" (TJSR) causes the collapse of cell monolayers and a characteristic rupture of cancer spheroids. Notably, TJSR is a major cause of drug-induced apoptosis in these cells. On the other hand, in PC3 cells that underwent partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the stimulation of RhoC induces an adverse effect by promoting amoeboid cell scattering and invasion. We identified complementary targets and drugs that allow for the induction of TJSR without stimulating RhoC.

However, the biological consequences of these alterations in prostate cancer have not yet been elucidated.  Methods:   To investigate the functional effects of these mutations, we deleted the C-terminal catalytic core motif of Kmt2c specifically in mouse prostate epithelium. We analysed the effect of Kmt2c SET domain deletion in a Pten-deficient PCa mouse model in vivo and of truncation mutations of KMT2C in a large number of prostate cancer patients.  Results:   We show here for the first time that impaired KMT2C methyltransferase activity drives proliferation and PIN formation and, when combined with loss of the tumour suppressor PTEN, triggers loss of senescence, metastatic dissemination and dramatically reduces life expectancy. In Kmt2c-mutated tumours we show enrichment of proliferative MYC gene signatures and loss of expression of the cell cycle repressor p16INK4A. In addition, we observe a striking reduction in disease-free survival of patients with KMT2C-mutated prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   We identified truncating events of KMT2C as drivers of proliferation and PIN formation. Loss of PTEN and KMT2C in prostate cancer results in loss of senescence, metastatic dissemination and reduced life expectancy.

Methylation-specific PCR was used to examine the methylation condition in AOX1 promoter. qRT-PCR was applied to measure the mRNA expression of AOX1. Western blot was employed to detect the expressions of AOX1 and the EMT associated proteins. Transwell and scratch healing assays were used to examine the invasive and migratory abilities of the prostate cancer cells respectively.  Results:   AOX1 was lowly expressed and hypermethylated in the prostate cancer tissues and cells. Also, AOX1 was downregulated at protein level in prostate cancer cells. Knocking down AOX1 could promote cell migration and invasion in the prostate cancer cells. By using a DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-AzadC was found to promote the expression of AOX1 and reverse the promoting effects of short interfering RNA against AOX1 on cell migration and invasion.

First, well-matched images of rigid phantoms were used to train a U-net, which is the supervised learning strategy to reduce serious artifacts. Second, the phantom-trained U-net generated intermediate CT images from the patient CBCT images. Finally, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) was trained with intermediate CT images and deformed planning CT images, which is the unsupervised learning strategy to learn the style of the patient images for further improvement. When testing or applying the trained model on patient CBCT images, the intermediate CT images were generated from the original CBCT image by U-net, and then the synthetic CT images were generated by the generator of CycleGAN with intermediate CT images as input. The performance was compared with conventional methods (U-net/CycleGAN alone trained with patient images) on the test set.Results.The proposed two-step method effectively improved the CBCT image quality to the level of CT scans.

A refined understanding of the age dependency of PRSs for a disease is important for personalized risk predictions and risk stratification. To further evaluate how the PRS relative risk for prostate cancer depends on age, we refined analyses for a validated PRS for prostate cancer by using 64,274 prostate cancer cases and 46,432 controls of diverse ancestry (82.8% European, 9.8% African American, 3.8% Latino, 2.8% Asian, and 0.8% Ghanaian). Our strategy applied a novel weighted proportional hazards model to case-control data to fully utilize age to refine how the relative risk decreased with age. We found significantly greater relative risks for younger men (age 30-55 years) compared with older men (70-88 years) for both relative risk per standard deviation of the PRS and dichotomized according to the upper 90th percentile of the PRS distribution. For the largest European ancestral group that could provide reliable resolution, the log-relative risk decreased approximately linearly from age 50 to age 75. Despite strong evidence of age-dependent genetic relative risk, our results suggest that absolute risk predictions differed little from predictions that assumed a constant relative risk over ages, from short-term to long-term predictions, simplifying implementation of risk discussions into clinical practice.""","""['Daniel J Schaid', 'Jason P Sinnwell', 'Anthony Batzler', 'Shannon K McDonnell']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['Validation of a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score and age-specific risks of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis within diverse populations.', 'Evaluation of a Multiethnic Polygenic Risk Score Model for Prostate Cancer.', 'Development and Validation of a Breast Cancer Polygenic Risk Score on the Basis of Genetic Ancestry Composition.', 'Implementation and implications for polygenic risk scores in healthcare.', 'Towards clinical utility of polygenic risk scores.', 'Aspartoacylase suppresses prostate cancer progression by blocking LYN activation.', 'Implementing Reporting Standards for Polygenic Risk Scores for Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.']"""

Using 13C-labeled substrates, we traced the incorporation of 13C into citrate by NMR of extracellular fluid. Our results provide direct evidence that glucose is a main carbon source for secreted citrate. We also demonstrate that carbons from supplied glutamine flow via oxidative Krebs cycle and reductive carboxylation routes to positions in secreted citrate but likely do not contribute to its net synthesis. The potential anaplerotic carbon sources aspartate and asparagine did not contribute to citrate carbons. We developed a quantitative metabolic model employing the 13C distribution in extracellular citrate after 13C glucose and pyruvate application to assess intracellular pathways of carbons for secreted citrate. From this model, it was estimated that in LNCaP about 21% of pyruvate entering the Krebs cycle is converted via pyruvate carboxylase as an anaplerotic route at a rate more than sufficient to compensate carbon loss of this cycle by citrate secretion. This model provides an estimation of the fraction of molecules, including citrate, leaving the Krebs cycle at every turn.

Anomalous utilization percentages are discussed during certification audits. This analysis aims to describe (1) how certified centers explain psychosocial care utilization percentages during audits and (2) the measures they then plan for improving psychosocial care utilization. The aim of the analysis is to help understand patterns of psychosocial care utilization in oncology and reduce potential disparities by describing the challenges that cancer centers face and their strategies for integrating psychosocial care into routine oncological care.  Methods:   The content of free-text comments regarding psychosocial utilization percentages by certified centers during certification audits in 2019 was analyzed. In total, 178 comments were analyzed from 116 prostate, colorectal, and breast cancer centers in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and Luxembourg.  Results:   The explanations for utilization percentages most often mentioned involved patients' levels of interest and need, outpatient care, staff shortages, inclusion of psychosocial care in other processes in the center, documentation issues, and factors regarding different legal regulations in countries outside Germany. The measures most often planned for improving psychosocial care utilization involved adjusting work processes, increasing staff resources, optimizing documentation, and establishing quality-assurance groups/task forces.

In order to reduce costs and minimize time to diagnosis, it is necessary to establish which patients benefit the most from doing mpMRI prior to prostate biopsy (PB). Our aim was to test if mpMRI still predicts PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa) in patients with high clinical suspicion of cancer, defined as prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 10 ng/ml, PSA-Density (PSAD) > 0.15 ng/ml/cc or suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively collected data on 206 patients who underwent mpMRI before PB at our Department from January 2017 to July 2018. mpMRI results were classified using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2. In primary analysis, we evaluated the association of mpMRI with PCa and csPCa and stratified this model for low and high clinical suspicion of cancer. In secondary analysis, we determined the rate of negative PB results in patients with high suspicion of cancer and compared theses rates with those obtained if only those with PI-RADS 3-5 would be biopsied.  Results:   In primary analysis and overall, mpMRI was predictive of PCa and csPCa. In stratified analysis, mpMRI was still significantly associated with csPCa in patients with PSA > 10 ng/ml and PSAD > 0.15 ng/ml/cc, but not in those with suspicious DRE. In secondary analysis, negative result rates were lower if only patients with PI-RADS 3-5 were biopsied, even in subgroups with high suspicion of cancer based on PSA and PSAD. In patients with suspicious DRE, however, the rate of negative results did not change significantly if only patients with PI-RADS 3-5 were biopsied.  Conclusions:   mpMRI is still useful in predicting csPCa in patients with PSA > 10 ng/mL and PSAD > 0.15 ng/ml/cc.

No clear cut-off of prostate specific antigen density (PSAD) for suspecting prostate cancer has been established in the Lebanese population. Our primary objective was to evaluate the diagnostic strength of the PSAD value versus total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) level in the Lebanese men in correlation with biopsy outcome to avoid unnecessary prostate biopsy.  Methods:   A retrospective study of 347 patients with history of prostate biopsy done for cancer suspicion included tPSA, prostate volume, and prostate density values and results of prostate biopsy. Data was collected from Bahman hospital and statistical analysis of the mean values of tPSA, prostate volume and PSAD in different age groups was done. Significance of the results was tested using.  Results:   On average, patients with negative biopsies were younger and they had lower tPSA levels, lower PSAD values and larger prostate volume compared to patients with positive biopsies. A PSAD cutoff of 0.185 ng/ml2 revealed the highest predictive strength for prostate cancer (6 times risk) compared with other parameters. These findings were mainly referred to patients with PSA > 10 ng/ml.  Conclusions:   A multifactorial approach must be conducted including all parameters in order to decide upon the need for prostate biopsy. PSAD proved to be a good marker in favor or against a prostate biopsy with a cut-off of 0.185 ng/ml2, especially in patients with tPSA level higher to 10 ng/ml.

Sipuleucel-T was the first immunotherapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic mCRPC. The androgen receptor-targeting agents (ARTAs) abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide were initially approved to treat mCRPC. Looking at chemotherapy-naïve men with mCRPC, we compared survival outcomes between the sipuleucel-T + ARTA cohort (men who received either sipuleucel-T or an ARTA in the first line, and then the other in the second line within 6 months) and the ARTA monotherapy cohort (men who only received ARTA monotherapy).  Methods:   This retrospective cohort analysis used longitudinal, adjudicated claims data from the US Medicare Fee-for-Service 100% research identifiable dataset that includes both urologic and oncologic practice settings. Eligible men started their first mCRPC treatment with either sipuleucel-T or ARTA in either 2014 or 2015 and had continuous Medicare Parts A, B, and D eligibility for the subsequent 3 years. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to analyze overall survival (OS), both overall and by index year, and to control for differences.  Results:   The sipuleucel-T + ARTA and ARTA monotherapy cohorts comprised 773 and 4642 men, respectively, with different characteristics at treatment start. The most commonly used ARTAs were enzalutamide in the former and abiraterone in the latter cohort. Median OS was 30.4 and 14.3 months in the sipuleucel-T + ARTA and ARTA monotherapy cohorts, respectively, with the sipuleucel-T + ARTA cohort having a 28.3% lower risk of death than the ARTA monotherapy cohort (hazard ratio 0.717; 95% CI 0.648, 0.793; p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   This real-world study of mCRPC treatment indicates that men receiving sipuleucel-T and ARTAs had a longer median OS than patients receiving treatment with an ARTA alone, suggesting that leveraging mechanisms of action can be beneficial in treating patients with mCRPC.""","""['Jason M Hafron', 'Helen M Wilfehrt', 'Christine Ferro', 'Matt Harmon', 'Scott C Flanders', 'Rana R McKay']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Adv Ther""","""['A Retrospective Observational Analysis of Overall Survival with Sipuleucel-T in Medicare Beneficiaries Treated for Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Real-world outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving second-line chemotherapy versus an alternative androgen receptor-targeted agent (ARTA) following early progression on a first-line ARTA in a US community oncology setting.', 'Real-world outcomes of sipuleucel-T treatment in PROCEED, a prospective registry of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treatment Sequences of Androgen Receptor–Targeted Agents for Prostate Cancer Internet.', 'Androgen Receptor Targeted Agents for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness Internet.', 'Combination Treatment with Sipuleucel-T and Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: STAMP and STRIDE Trials.', 'Therapeutic strategies for gastric cancer targeting immune cells: Future directions.', 'The Immunotherapy and Immunosuppressive Signaling in Therapy-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

In addition to surgical and patient factors, longer preoperative membranous urethral length (MUL) has been suggested to be associated with improved postoperative urinary continence outcomes. Here, we assess the association of preoperative MUL and the risk of persistent postoperative urinary incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer on extended follow-up.  Methods:   All participants underwent RARP at the University of California, San Francisco between 2000-2018. Patients were excluded if preoperative MRI-measured MUL was not performed by a radiologist. A single, blinded urologist remeasured MUL retrospectively. Logistic regression models examined associations between radiologist- and urologist-measured MUL and likelihood of persistent incontinence post-RARP by two definitions: strict incontinence (>0 pad/day) and social incontinence (>1 pad/day).  Results:   In 251 men with a median follow-up of 42 months (IQR 29-76), the median MUL measurements were 14 mm ([IQR 12-17], radiologist) and 15 mm ([IQR 12-18], urologist) with poor agreement (interclass correlation coefficient 0.34). On logistic regression, urologist-measured longer MUL was associated with lower likelihood of strict incontinence within 6 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-0.94) and 12 months (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.82-0.98) and social incontinence within 6 months (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.86-1.00) and 12 months (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.74-0.95). Radiologist-measured longer MUL was associated with lower likelihood of strict incontinence within 6 months (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87-1.00) and social within 12 months (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.77-1.00). MUL was not associated with likelihood of strict or social incontinence within 24 months.  Conclusion:   Preoperative MRI-measured MUL was not associated with urinary incontinence after 12 months post-RARP. Poor agreement between radiologists' and urologist's measurements supports standardizing MUL measurements to establish the likelihood of early incontinence.""","""['Scott A Greenberg', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Peter E Lonergan', 'Samuel L Washington rd', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Ronald J Zagoria', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Minimal residual membranous urethral length and membranous urethral length predict poor recovery from incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and after open radical prostatectomy.', 'Association Between Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Urethral Parameters and Continence Recovery Following Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Anatomical predictors of long-term urinary incontinence after robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy: A systematic review.', 'Prostate MRI for Improving Personalized Risk Prediction of Incontinence and Surgical Planning: The Role of Membranous Urethral Length Measurements and the Use of 3D Models.', 'Inter-observer variability in male pelvic-floor MRI measurements that might predict post-prostatectomy incontinence.', 'The Efficacy of Urinary Continence in Patients Undergoing Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy with Bladder-Prostatic Muscle Reconstruction and Bladder Neck Eversion Anastomosis.', 'A standardized method to measure the membranous urethral length (MUL) on MRI of the prostate with high inter- and intra-observer agreement.']"""

Here, we focused on miR-550a-3p, which we found downregulated in 45 DMPM clinical samples compared to normal tissues and whose expression levels were associated with patient outcome. Through a gain-of-function approach using miRNA mimics in 3 DMPM cell lines, we demonstrated the tumor-suppressive role of miR-550a-3p. Specifically, miRNA ectopic expression impaired cell proliferation and invasiveness, enhanced the apoptotic response, and reduced the growth of DMPM xenografts in mice. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects were also observed in prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines following miR-550a-3p ectopic expression. miR-550a-3p effects were mediated, at least in part, by the direct inhibition of HSP90AA1 and the consequent downregulation of its target proteins, the levels of which were rescued upon disruption of miRNA-HSP90AA1 mRNA pairing, partially abrogating miR-550a-3p-induced cellular effects.

We computed motion-compensated dose distributions for (i) all prostate positions during treatment (simulating non-gated treatments) and (ii) for prostate positions within the gating window (gated treatments). To evaluate the impact of PTV margin on prostate coverage, we simulated coverage with smaller margins than clinically applied both for gated and non-gated treatments. Motion-compensated fraction doses were accumulated and dose metrics were compared.  Results:   We found a negligible dosimetric impact of beam-gating on prostate coverage (median of 0.00 Gy for both D95% and Dmean). For 18/20 patients, prostate coverage (D95% ≥ 100%) would have been ensured with a prostate-to-PTV margin of 3 mm, even without gating. The same was true for all but one fraction.  Conclusion:   Beam-gating has negligible dosimetric impact in online-adaptive MRgRT of prostate cancer. Accounting for motion, the clinically used prostate-to-PTV margin could potentially be reduced from 5 mm to 3 mm for 18/20 patients.""","""['Isak Wahlstedt', 'Nicolaus Andratschke', 'Claus P Behrens', 'Stefanie Ehrbar', 'Hubert S Gabryś', 'Helena Garcia Schüler', 'Matthias Guckenberger', 'Abraham George Smith', 'Stephanie Tanadini-Lang', 'José D Tascón-Vidarte', 'Ivan R Vogelius', 'Janita E van Timmeren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Assessment of intrafractional prostate motion and its dosimetric impact in MRI-guided online adaptive radiotherapy with gating.', 'Retrospective study comparing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) setup strategies for prostate treatment: repositioning vs. replanning.', 'Image-guided radiotherapy for prostate cancer with cone beam CT: dosimetric effects of imaging frequency and PTV margin.', 'Advancing the treatment of localized prostate cancer with MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRgRT) for Treatment of Oligometastases: Review of Clinical Applications and Challenges.', 'Patient-specific quality assurance strategies for synthetic computed tomography in magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy of the abdomen.', 'Synthetic computed tomography for low-field magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy in the abdomen.', 'Adaptive magnetic resonance image guided radiation for intact localized prostate cancer how to optimally test a rapidly emerging technology.']"""

Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 54,947 adult Hispanic Americans diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2015. Origin was Mexican (N = 7844; 14.3%), South/Central American (N = 4010; 7.3%), Puerto Rican (N = 2938; 5.4%), Cuban (N = 2549; 4.6%), Dominican (N = 1535; 2.8%), Hispanic not specified (N = 36,269; 65.7%). Comparison between characteristics among Hispanic American sub-groups' categories was performed using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical and continuous variables respectively.  Results:   Mexicans had overall worse disease at presentation including highest median PSA (7.8 ng/mL), most prevalent T3/T4 stage (6.7%), M1 stage (8.9%), and high-grade Gleason scores (24.0%) when compared to all other Hispanic American groups. Cubans were most likely to receive hormone therapy and radiation therapy and least likely to receive surgical treatment. Compared to Mexicans, Cubans (hazards ratio [HR] = 1.30, 95% confidence interval = [1.16-1.44]) had worse overall survival, while Puerto Ricans (HR = 1.08 [0.95-1.19] had similar overall survival, and Dominicans (HR = 0.63 [0 0.53-0.75]), South/Central Americans (HR = 0.75, [0.66-0.84]) and not specified (HR = 0.84 [0.79-0.91]) had better survival.  Conclusion:   Among Hispanic Americans with different countries of origin, disparities in prostate cancer characteristics, treatment choice, and survival do exist. Mexicans had the least favorable prostate cancer characteristics at presentation.

Prostate neoplasms are visible in magnetic resonance images (MRI) but it is difficult for the practitioner to locate them at the time of performing a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy. In this study, we present a new methodology, based on simulation, that predicts both prostate deformation and lesion migration during the biopsy.  Methods:   A three-dimensional (3-D) anatomy model of the pelvic region, based on medical images, is constructed. A finite element (FE) numerical simulation of the organs motion and deformation as a result of the pressure exerted by the TRUS probe is carried out using the Code-Aster open-source computer software. Initial positions of potential prostate lesions prior to biopsy are taken into consideration and the final location of each lesion is targeted in the FE simulation output.  Results:   Our 3-D FE simulations show that the effect of the pressure exerted by the TRUS probe is twofold as the prostate experiences both a motion and a deformation of its original shape. We targeted the relocation of five small prostate lesions when the TRUS probe exerts a force of 30 N on the rectum inner wall. The distance travelled by these lesions ranged between 5.6 and 13.9 mm.  Conclusions:   Our new methodology can help to predict the location of neoplasms during a prostate biopsy but further studies are needed to validate our results. Moreover, the new methodology is completely developed on open-source software, which means that its implementation would be affordable to all healthcare providers.""","""['Muhammad Qasim', 'Dolors Puigjaner', 'Joan Herrero', 'Josep M López', 'Carme Olivé', 'Gerard Fortuny', 'Josep Garcia-Bennett']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted, 3D transrectal ultrasound-guided fusion biopsy for prostate cancer: Quantifying the impact of needle delivery error on diagnosis.', 'Multiattribute probabilistic prostate elastic registration (MAPPER): application to fusion of ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The lack of prostate cancer screening in SSA contributes to late-stage diagnosis, treatment delays, and poor survival among patients. We analyzed the availability and use of prostate cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment guidelines, procedures, and costs in few SSA countries to determine factors for consideration in the development of prostate cancer screening guidelines for SSA.  Methods:   We applied mixed methods approaches to collect data through an electronic survey administered to clinicians (oncologists, urologists, pathologists, nurses, and radiation oncologists) providing prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment services in multiple sub-Saharan countries.  Results:   Inconsistencies in respondents' understanding of the availability and use of prostate cancer screening guidelines in their countries were noted. Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) and Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) were the most commonly available screening modalities. Available diagnostic procedures included a combination of prostate biopsies, transrectal ultrasonography, and DRE. Our study's data suggest that PSA and DRE exams are available for early diagnosis and screening procedures. Availability of treatment modalities with curative intent and costs for prostate cancer related procedures varied between and within countries.  Conclusions:   PSA and DRE are available for detecting prostate cancer and may detect aggressive cancers early, leading to improved outcomes. However, PSA screening is also associated with overdiagnosis and over-treatment.

In this work, we propose a novel polar transform network (PTN) to handle this problem from a fundamentally new perspective, where the prostate is represented and segmented in the polar coordinate space rather than the original image grid space. This new representation gives a prostate volume, especially the most challenging apex and base sub-areas, much denser samples than the background and thus facilitate the learning of discriminative features for accurate prostate segmentation. Moreover, in the polar representation, the prostate surface can be efficiently parameterized using a 2D surface radius map with respect to a centroid coordinate, which allows the proposed PTN to obtain superior accuracy compared with its counterparts using convolutional neural networks while having significantly fewer (18%∼41%) trainable parameters. We also equip our PTN with a novel strategy of centroid perturbed test-time augmentation (CPTTA), which is designed to further improve the segmentation accuracy and quantitatively assess the model uncertainty at the same time. The uncertainty estimation function provides valuable feedback to clinicians when manual modifications or approvals are required for the segmentation, substantially improving the clinical significance of our work. We conduct a three-fold cross validation on a clinical dataset consisting of 315 transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images to comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that our proposed PTN with CPTTA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with statistical significance on most of the metrics while exhibiting a much smaller model size.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of NEPC, especially treatment-induced NEPC, remain unclear. Emerging evidence indicates that elevated monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) contribute to the proliferation, cell stemness, and bone metastasis in PCa. Here, we generated an enzalutamide-induced NED cell model to assess the role of MAOA during NED. Overall, MAOA expression was significantly increased upon Enz long-term exposure and was required for neuroendocrine marker expression. In particular, Enz was found to induce NED via the MAOA/mTOR/HIF-1α signaling axis. Further analyses revealed that the MAOA inhibitor clorgyline(CLG) may bring multiple benefits to CRPC patients, including better therapeutic effect and delays NED. These findings suggest that MAOA may be an important target for the development of anti-NED therapies, thereby providing a novel strategy for the combined application of CLG and AR inhibitors in the clinic.""","""['Xue Shui', 'Xuehua Ren', 'Rong Xu', 'Qinghua Xie', 'Yaohua Hu', 'Jing Qin', 'Han Meng', 'Caiqin Zhang', 'Jumei Zhao', 'Changhong Shi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Effect of Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) inhibitors on androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'MAOA-a novel decision maker of apoptosis and autophagy in hormone refractory neuroendocrine prostate cancer cells.', 'Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA): A promising target for prostate cancer therapy.', 'Reprogramming landscape highlighted by dynamic transcriptomes in therapy-induced neuroendocrine differentiation.', 'Role of MicroRNAs in Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Monoamine oxidase A: An emerging therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Coumarin-Based Dual Inhibitors of Human Carbonic Anhydrases and Monoamine Oxidases Featuring Amino Acyl and (Pseudo)-Dipeptidyl Appendages: In Vitro and Computational Studies.']"""

The development of BET inhibitors (BETi) has expanded our knowledge of BET protein function beyond transcriptional regulation and has ushered several prostate cancer (PCa) clinical trials. However, BETi as a single agent is not associated with antitumor activity in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We hypothesized novel combinatorial strategies are likely to enhance the efficacy of BETi. By using PCa patient-derived explants and xenograft models, we show that BETi treatment enhanced the efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) and overcame radioresistance. Mechanistically, BETi potentiated the activity of RT by blocking DNA repair. We also report a synergistic relationship between BETi and topoisomerase I (TOP1) inhibitors (TOP1i). We show that the BETi OTX015 synergized with the new class of synthetic noncamptothecin TOP1i, LMP400 (indotecan), to block tumor growth in aggressive CRPC xenograft models. Mechanistically, BETi potentiated the antitumor activity of TOP1i by disrupting replication fork stability. Longitudinal analysis of patient tumors indicated that TOP1 transcript abundance increased as patients progressed from hormone-sensitive prostate cancer to CRPC. TOP1 was highly expressed in metastatic CRPC, and its expression correlated with the expression of BET family genes.

Methods:   We gathered cases diagnosed with prostate cancer based on the United States Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database from 2004 to 2020. We divided the included cases into 3 groups based on the primary suspected drugs: a hormone therapy group, a positive control group (taxanes), and a negative control group. We employed reporting odds ratio, a disproportionality method, to detect the association between ILD events and target drugs.  Results:   We finally included a total of 85 403 cases, 69 894 cases (628 ILD event cases) in the hormone therapy group, 2302 cases (158 ILD event cases) in the positive control group and 13 207 cases (72 ILD event cases) in the negative control group. There were 394 ILD event cases (62.74%) in the hormone therapy group in Japan; 78.68% of the ILD events occurred within the first year after hormone treatment. Disproportionality analysis indicated that ILD events were significantly associated with nilutamide, flutamide, bicalutamide, goserelin, degarelix and apalutamide; the reporting odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 32.14 (11.03-93.63), 9.93 (3.62-27.21), 8.19 (6.01-11.16), 3.74 (2.61-5.37), 2.41 (1.55-3.75) and 1.94 (1.01-3.75), respectively.

Materials and methods:   We assessed 4555 consecutive RARP patients from a high-volume center 2008-2018. Analyses were restricted to normal-weight vs. obese patients (≥ 30 kg/m2). Multivariable cox regression analyses (MVA) assessed the effect of obesity on biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastatic progression (MP), erectile function and urinary continence recovery.

O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), the enzyme that catalyzes the covalent addition of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of proteins, is often highly expressed in prostate cancer with its expression correlated with high Gleason score. In this study, we have identified an AR and OGT coregulated factor, Vpr (HIV-1) binding protein (VPRBP) also known as DDB1 and CUL4 Associated Factor 1 (DCAF1). We show that VPRBP is regulated by the AR at the transcript level, and stabilized by OGT at the protein level. VPRBP knockdown in prostate cancer cells led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation, p53 stabilization, nucleolar fragmentation, and increased p53 recruitment to the chromatin. In human prostate tumor samples, VPRBP protein overexpression correlated with AR amplification, OGT overexpression, a shorter time to postoperative biochemical progression and poor clinical outcome. In clinical transcriptomic data, VPRBP expression was positively correlated with the AR and also with AR activity gene signatures.  Implications:   In conclusion, we have shown that VPRBP/DCAF1 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation by restraining p53 activation under the influence of the AR and OGT.""","""['Ninu Poulose', 'Nicholas Forsythe', 'Adam Polonski', 'Gemma Gregg', 'Sarah Maguire', 'Marc Fuchs', 'Sarah Minner', 'Guido Sauter', 'Simon S McDade', 'Ian G Mills']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['O-GlcNAc transferase integrates metabolic pathways to regulate the stability of c-MYC in human prostate cancer cells.', 'High OGT activity is essential for MYC-driven proliferation of prostate cancer cells.', 'Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpr-binding protein VprBP, a WD40 protein associated with the DDB1-CUL4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential for DNA replication and embryonic development.', 'The role of tumor suppressor dysregulation in prostate cancer progression.', 'Mechanisms of prostate cancer cell survival after inhibition of AR expression.']"""

Next, gDNA was amplified and analyzed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) using a specific gene panel for PCa. Raw data were refined to exclude false-positive mutations; thus, variants with coverage and frequency lower than 100× and 5%, respectively were removed. Mutation significance was processed by Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling, ClinVar, and Varsome tools. Most of 3000 mutations (80%) were single nucleotide variants and the remaining 20% indels. After raw data elaboration, 312 variants were selected. Most mutated genes were KMT2D (26.45%), FOXA1 (16.13%), ATM (15.81%), ZFHX3 (9.35%), TP53 (8.06%), and APC (5.48%). Hot spot mutations in FOXA1, ATM, ZFHX3, SPOP, and MED12 were also found. Truncating mutations of ATM, lesions lying in hot spot regions of SPOP and FOXA1 as well as mutations of TP53 correlated with poor prognosis. Importantly, we have also found some germline mutations associated with hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome. gDNA sequencing of 48 cancer tissues by NGS allowed to detect new tumor variants as well as confirmed lesions in genes linked to prostate cancer.

Statistics regarding prostate cancer indicate longer wait times for patients from a local hospital compared to patients from a university hospital. This study describes which health system-related factors influence variations in wait times. Eighteen healthcare workers participated in qualitative individual interviews conducted using a semi-structured interview guide. Transcripts were analysed by systematic text condensation, which is a cross-case method for the thematic analysis of qualitative data. The analysis unveiled four categories describing possible health system-related factors causing variation in times spent on diagnostics for patients in the local hospital and in university hospital, respectively: (a) capacity and competence, (b) logistics and efficiency, (c) need for highly specialised investigations, and (d) need for extra consultations. Centralisation of surgical treatment necessitated the transfer of patients, with extra steps indicated in the CPP for patients transferring from the local hospital to the university hospital for surgery. The local hospital seemed to lack capacity more frequently than the university hospital. Possible factors explaining variations in wait time between the two hospitals concern both internal conditions at the hospitals in organising CPPs and the implications of transferring patients between hospitals. Differences in hospitals' capacity can cause variations in wait time. The extra steps involved in transferring patients between hospitals can lead to additional time spent in CPP.""","""['Anne Grete Valbekmo', 'Lise Mo', 'Gudveig Gjøsund', 'Erna Håland', 'Line Melby']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Health Plann Manage""","""[""When time matters: a qualitative study on hospital staff's strategies for meeting the target times in cancer patient pathways."", 'Are wait lists inevitable in subacute ambulatory and community health services?

One hundred and five patients underwent adjuvant RT (aRT), 77 early-savage RT (esRT), and 123 salvage RT (sRT). Biochemical relapse-free survival (BRFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and toxicity were analyzed. A propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to account for potential confounders between aRT and esRT groups.  Results:   The median follow-up was 33 months. Three-year BRFS and PFS were 82 and 85.2%, respectively, in the overall population. At the multivariate analysis, Gleason score and hormone therapy were factors independently correlated with BRFS and PFS. After PSM, there was no difference in BRFS and PFS between aRT and esRT patients. Severe toxicity was represented by grade 3 urinary incontinence (3.5%) and urgency (1%), and aRT correlated with increased any-grade acute toxicity. Severe grade 3 gastrointestinal late toxicity occurred in 1.3% of cases.

Materials and methods:   Analysis of a cohort of 7065 men treated with RPE at 88 operating sites (prostate cancer centers, ""PCCs"") between 2016 and 2019. Patients completed EPIC-26 and sociodemographic information surveys at baseline and 12 months after RPE. Survey data were linked to clinical data. EPIC-26 domain scores at 12 months after RPE were adjusted for relevant confounders (including baseline domain score, clinical and sociodemographic information) using regression analysis. Differences between sites were described using minimal important differences (MIDs) and interquartile ranges (IQR). The effects of casemix adjustment on the score results were described using Cohen's d and MIDs.  Results:   Adjusted domain scores at 12 months varied between sites, with IQRs of 66-78 (incontinence), 89-92 (irritative/obstructive function), and 20-29 (sexual function). Changes in domain scores after casemix adjustment for sites ≥ 1 MID were noted for the incontinence domain (six sites).

WNT signaling is a promising therapeutic target for metastatic PCa. GIPC2 is a GIPC1 paralog involved in WNT signaling pathways associated with tumor progression, but its role in PCa metastasis remains unclear. Herein, we demonstrated that high GIPC2 expression in PCa tissues was significantly associated with distant metastasis and poor prognosis. Functional studies demonstrated that high GIPC2 expression due to CpG-island demethylation promoted increased metastatic capabilities of PCa cells. Conversely, silencing GIPC2 expression significantly inhibited PCa metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, GIPC2 directly bound the WNT co-receptor Fzd7 through its PDZ domain, which enabled activation of WNT-β-catenin cascades, thereby stimulating PCa metastasis. Interestingly, GIPC2 protein was also identified as a component of exosomes and that it robustly stimulated PCa adhesion, invasion, and migration. The presence of GIPC2 in tumor-derived exosomes and ability to impact the behavior of tumor cells suggest that GIPC2 is a novel epigenetic oncogene involved in PCa metastasis.

A quantitative method for analysis of 22 BXs, including novel metabolites identified by mass spectrometry and NMR, was established, and applied to plasma samples from a randomized crossover study where patients with indolent PC (n = 17) consumed 485 g whole grain rye/rye bran or fiber supplemented refined wheat daily for 6 wk.

Patients and methods:   This retrospective study investigated 14 patients histologically diagnosed with NEPC at Kanazawa University Hospital between 2000 and 2019. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were retrospectively analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Additionally, log-rank tests were used to compare survival distributions.  Results:   We included 14 patients histologically diagnosed with NEPC among 1,845 patients with prostate cancer. Four patients (0.22%) were diagnosed with de novo NEPC, and ten patients were diagnosed with NEPC during treatment. First-line platinum-based therapy's objective response rate (ORR) was 66.7%, and disease control rate was 91.7%; median PFS was 7.5 months. The median OS from NEPC diagnosis was 20.3 months. The median OS of the liver metastasis (-) group was 31.6 months, and that of the (+) group was 9.4 months (p=0.03, hazard ratio=0.24). The median OS of the somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS)-positive group was 31.6 months, and that of the SRS-negative group was 10.6 months (p=0.04, hazard ratio=0.14).

The object of this study was to clarify clinical outcomes of second-line therapy for CRPC after first-line ARTA.  Patients and methods:   The medical records of 130 consecutive patients with CRPC with disease progression during first-line ARTA and who started second-line therapy at our Institution between 2014 and 2020 were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 130 patients with CRPC were identified. Ninety patients underwent ARTA-ARTA treatment, and 40 patients underwent ARTA-docetaxel treatment. The median observation period after second-line ARTA or docetaxel administration was 14.2 months. The prostate-specific antigen response rates overall, and after second-line ARTA, and docetaxel were 26.8%, 24.7%, and 31.6%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and 1- and 2-year PFS rates of second-line therapy were 7.9 months and 34.6% and 15.4%, respectively.

Among these inhibitors, apalutamide is regarded as a key drug because of its effectiveness. However, risk factors for and the timing of the onset of apalutamide-related cutaneous adverse events remain unclear. Therefore, the present study investigated key risk factors for and timing of the onset of apalutamide-related cutaneous adverse events.  Patients and methods:   Sixty-two Japanese patients with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with 240 mg/day of apalutamide were enrolled in the present study.  Results:   Twenty-four patients (38.7%) developed cutaneous adverse events. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of age, height, and body weight identified body weight as a significant predictive factor for the incidence of cutaneous adverse events (p=0.019). When the mean body weight of patients (63.80 kg) was set as the cut-off value, the Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the risk of cutaneous adverse events was significantly increased in those with a body weight <63.8 kg (p=0.003, the log-rank test). The analysis also showed that cutaneous adverse events developed within the first 6 months regardless of body weight.

Nevertheless, it is unclear whether they play a causal role in cancer risk or if they act as a non-causal biomarker.  Methods:   We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to examine the genetically predicted effects of epigenetic age acceleration as measured by HannumAge (nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), Horvath Intrinsic Age (24 SNPs), PhenoAge (11 SNPs), and GrimAge (4 SNPs) on multiple cancers (i.e. breast, prostate, colorectal, ovarian and lung cancer). We obtained genome-wide association data for biological ageing from a meta-analysis (N = 34,710), and for cancer from the UK Biobank (N cases = 2671-13,879; N controls = 173,493-372,016), FinnGen (N cases = 719-8401; N controls = 74,685-174,006) and several international cancer genetic consortia (N cases = 11,348-122,977; N controls = 15,861-105,974). Main analyses were performed using multiplicative random effects inverse variance weighted (IVW) MR. Individual study estimates were pooled using fixed effect meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses included MR-Egger, weighted median, weighted mode and Causal Analysis using Summary Effect Estimates (CAUSE) methods, which are robust to some of the assumptions of the IVW approach.  Results:   Meta-analysed IVW MR findings suggested that higher GrimAge acceleration increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR = 1.12 per year increase in GrimAge acceleration, 95% CI 1.04-1.20, p = 0.002). The direction of the genetically predicted effects was consistent across main and sensitivity MR analyses. Among subtypes, the genetically predicted effect of GrimAge acceleration was greater for colon cancer (IVW OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.09-1.21, p = 0.006), than rectal cancer (IVW OR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.97-1.13, p = 0.24). Results were less consistent for associations between other epigenetic clocks and cancers.  Conclusions:   GrimAge acceleration may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Findings for other clocks and cancers were inconsistent. Further work is required to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying the results.

STEAP1 and STEAP2 are overexpressed in various cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression and prognostic value of STEAP1 and STEAP2 in patients with lung cancer.  Methods:   The mRNA expression and protein expression of STEAP1 and STEAP2 and their prognostic characteristics were examined using Oncomine, GEPIA, and Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotters. The correlation analysis of STEAP1 and STEAP2 gene and protein levels was conducted using GeneMANIA and STRING. KEGG pathway analysis was used to explore the related signal pathways of STEAP 1 and STEAP2. Immunohistochemical methods were used to compare the expression of STEAP2 in normal lung and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, and immunocytochemistry were used to evaluate the expression of STEAP1 and STEAP2 in three lung cancer cell lines and normal lung epithelial cell lines.  Results:   Analysis of the Oncomine database and GEPIA showed that STEAP1 was upregulated and STEAP2 was downregulated in lung cancer tissue, and both expressions were related to the clinical stage of lung cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that STEAP1 protein expression was significantly upregulated in lung cancer compared to that in adjacent tissues. The expression of STEAP1 was positively correlated with the migration and invasion abilities of lung cancer cells. Compared with paracancer tissues, the expression of STEAP2 protein in lung cancer was significantly downregulated and was correlated with the histological grade of squamous cell carcinoma, pathological classification of adenocarcinoma, tumor, lymph node, and metastasis clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis. The expression of STEAP2 was negatively correlated with the migration and invasion abilities of lung cancer cells. The KM curve showed that the downregulation of STEAP1 expression and upregulation of STEAP2 expression were related to a good lung cancer prognosis.  Conclusion:   STEAP1 and STEAP2 are expected to be potential diagnostic and prognostic markers for lung cancer, which may provide more accurate prognostic indicators for lung cancer.""","""['Tianshu Liu', 'Xiaoxin Niu', 'Yanqing Li', 'Zekun Xu', 'Jie Chen', 'Geng Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Surg Oncol""","""['Prognostic Significance of Iron Metabolism Related Genes in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'STEAP1 Inhibits Breast Cancer Metastasis and Is Associated With Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Procession.', 'STEAP1 protein overexpression is an independent marker for biochemical recurrence in prostate carcinoma.', 'STEAP proteins: from structure to applications in cancer therapy.', 'Prognostic Significance of Iron Metabolism Related Genes in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'STEAP2 promotes osteosarcoma progression by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and is regulated by EFEMP2.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.', 'UCHL1 acts as a potential oncogene and affects sensitivity of common anti-tumor drugs in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

In this study, we have shown the influence of a new palladium-based anticancer agent in contrast to the six distinct prostate cancer lines and the primary cultures.  Methods:   In this study, we have used six distinct prostate cell lines, that is, PNT2-C2, LNCaP, BPH-1, PC-3, PNT1A, and P4E6. The MTP and ATP assay were performed to evaluate the growth of the cell and the flow cytometry to investigate the status of the cell cycle. The antigrowth effect of the palladium complex was evaluated against different cell lines at three time zones 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. [PdCl(terpy)] (capsule)-2H2O is synthesized by direct encapsulation of equimolar amounts of capsule ions into [Pd (terpy) Cl] Cl-2H2O.  Results:   A comparative analysis was done on 25 mM etoposide and 12 mM cisplatin, cytotoxic agents. The lowest IC50 value at 72 hours was 0.128 mM for BPH-1 cell lines with 0.139 mM, whereas PNT2-C2 cells were found to be most resistant with IC50 values of 0.829 mM. The antigrowth effect of palladium complex on cell lines was measured using the MTS assay at 24, 48, and 72 hours. BPH-1, PNT2-C2, and PNT1A either possess normal tissues or have benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues whereas P4E6, PC-3, and LNCaP cell lines possess malignant origin. The Pd complex exhibited significant cytotoxic action in stem cells when compared against etoposide.

This study aimed to determine whether prostate zonal volume was associated with the location and aggressiveness of PCa.  Methods:   412 PCa patients were retrospectively enrolled. The volumes of the whole prostate (V) and transition zone (Vtz) were calculated by the prolate ellipsoid formula, and volume of the peripheral zone (Vpz) was calculated by their subtraction. Locations of PCa were divided into three categories, including peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (Vtz) and mixed zone group. The mixed zone group was further divided into PZ-dominated, TZ-dominated and equally distributed subgroups.  Results:   The Vtz of Gleason score (GS) 3 + 4 group was the largest, while the Vpz of GS 9 group was the largest. Tumor diameters of the PZ and TZ groups were weakly correlated with their corresponding zonal volume (r = 0.261, p < 0.001; r = 0.311, p = 0.009, respectively). There was no significant difference in the zonal volumes and GS distribution among the location groups. The proportion of tumors with high-grade GS of 8 and 9 was higher in the PZ than that in the TZ group (38.5 vs 24.3%, p = 0.041). For tumors located in the TZ, the V and Vpz of tumors with high-grade GS were larger than those in the low-grade GS of 7 group (p = 0.033 and 0.039, respectively). Among the subgroups of mixed zone group, the Vtz of the TZ-dominated group was larger than those of PZ-dominated and equally distributed groups (p = 0.016 and 0.001, respectively).  Conclusion:   PCa with high-grade GS is more likely to have a relatively larger Vpz and involve PZ, while PCa with a larger Vtz is more likely to be with low-grade GS, which support the theoretical model that pressure exerted by increasing prostate size/mechanical deformation may inhibit PCa growth from the clinical point.

In this work, we use an IQA controller to predict the task amenability which, itself being parameterised by neural networks, can be trained simultaneously with the task predictor. We further develop a meta-reinforcement learning framework to improve the adaptability for both IQA controllers and task predictors, such that they can be fine-tuned efficiently on new datasets or meta-tasks.

All baseline evaluations were performed before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and 69.7% of the 1-year assessments were completed after the first lockdown. Cognitive decline was defined as the decrease in MoCA from baseline to the 1-year evaluation below 1.5 standard deviations of the distribution of changes in the whole cohort. Participants scoring below age- and education-specific normative reference values in the MoCA were considered to have cognitive impairment. Age- and education-adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were computed for the association between ADT and cognitive outcomes.  Results:   Mean MoCA scores increased from baseline to the 1-year evaluation (22.3 versus 22.8, P < 0.001). Cognitive decline was more frequent in the ADT group, and even more after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic (aOR 6.81 versus 1.93, P for interaction = 0.233).

This retrospective study was performed to determine whether CK offers better dose distribution than IMRT and/or VMAT.  Materials and methods:   Treatment plans for three techniques were prepared using the same treatment parameters (36.35 Gy, 7.25 Gy/fr). We evaluated target coverage, conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gamma index (GI), and organs at risk (OAR) constraints.  Results:   The mean planning target volume (PTV) dose for CK (39.58 Gy) was significantly greater than VMAT or IMRT (both 36.25 Gy). However, CK resulted in a wider dose range (31.48 to 45.89 Gy) vs. VMAT and IMRT (34.6-38.76 Gy). The mean dose to the rectum (V36Gy, mm3) was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the CK plans (219.78 vs. 519.59 and 422.62, respectively). The mean bladder dose (V37Gy, mm3) was significantly greater for CK (3256 vs. 1090.75 for VMAT and 4.5 for IMRT (p < 0.001). CK yielded significantly better CI (1.07 vs. 1.17 and 1.25 for VMAT and IMRT, respectively; p < 0.01) and HI values (1.27 vs. 1.07 and 1.04; p < 0.01). GI values for the δd = 3mm, δ% = 3% criteria were 99.86 (VMAT), 99.07 (IMRT) and 99.99 (CK). For δd = 2mm, δ% = 2%, the corresponding values were 98.3, 93.35, and 97.12, respectively.

To investigate the impact of PSM, its length, the focality and the Gleason grade at the PSM, on the oncologic outcomes in nonorgan-confined RP patients.  Methods:   Within a high-volume center database, we identified patients who harbored non-organ-confined (pT3) prostate cancer (PCa) at RP between 2010 and 2016. Only patients without lymph node invasion were included. Kaplan-Meier analyses and multivariable Cox regression models were used to test the effect of PSM on biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastasis, and cancer-specific death after RP in patients without adjuvant radiotherapy.  Results:   Overall, 3705 patients were identified. Of those, 27.2% (n = 1007) harbored PSM. At 96 months after RP, BCR-free, metastasis-free and cancer-specific survival was 41.6 versus 57.5%, 82.7 versus 88.6%, and 94.7 versus 98.5% for patients with versus without PSM (all p < 0.001).

A plausible approach for this purpose is to use individual ultrasound signals corresponding to a core as inputs and consider the histopathology diagnosis for the entire core as labels. However, this introduces significant amount of label noise to training and degrades the classification performance. Previously, we suggested that histopathology-reported cancer involvement can be a reasonable approximation for the label noise.  Methods:   Here, we propose an involvement-based label refinement (iLR) method to correct corrupted labels and improve cancer classification. The difference between predicted and true cancer involvements is used to guide the label refinement process. We further incorporate iLR into state-of-the-art methods for learning with noisy labels and predicting cancer involvement.  Results:   We use 258 biopsy cores from 70 patients and demonstrate that our proposed label refinement method improves the performance of multiple noise-tolerant approaches and achieves a balanced accuracy, correlation coefficient, and mean absolute error of 76.7%, 0.68, and 12.4, respectively.  Conclusions:   Our key contribution is to leverage a data-centric method to deal with noisy labels using histopathology reports, and improve the performance of prostate cancer diagnosis through a hierarchical training process with label refinement.""","""['Minh Nguyen Nhat To#', 'Fahimeh Fooladgar#', 'Golara Javadi', 'Sharareh Bayat', 'Samira Sojoudi', 'Antonio Hurtado', 'Silvia Chang', 'Peter Black', 'Parvin Mousavi', 'Purang Abolmaesumi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Training deep neural networks with noisy clinical labels: toward accurate detection of prostate cancer in US data.', 'Deep neural maps for unsupervised visualization of high-grade cancer in prostate biopsies.', 'Multiple instance learning combined with label invariant synthetic data for guiding systematic prostate biopsy: a feasibility study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Ultrasonography of the prostate gland : From B‑image through multiparametric ultrasound to targeted biopsy.']"""

Objective:   To investigate racial disparities in severity of COVID-19 presentation, clinical complications, and outcomes between Black patients and non-Hispanic White patients with cancer and COVID-19.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used data from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry from March 17, 2020, to November 18, 2020, to examine the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 in Black patients with cancer. Data analysis was performed from December 2020 to February 2021.  Exposures:   Black and White race recorded in patient's electronic health record.  Main outcomes and measures:   An a priori 5-level ordinal scale including hospitalization intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and all-cause death.  Results:   Among 3506 included patients (1768 women [50%]; median [IQR] age, 67 [58-77] years), 1068 (30%) were Black and 2438 (70%) were White. Black patients had higher rates of preexisting comorbidities compared with White patients, including obesity (480 Black patients [45%] vs 925 White patients [38%]), diabetes (411 Black patients [38%] vs 574 White patients [24%]), and kidney disease (248 Black patients [23%] vs 392 White patients [16%]). Despite the similar distribution of cancer type, cancer status, and anticancer therapy at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis, Black patients presented with worse illness and had significantly worse COVID-19 severity (unweighted odds ratio, 1.34 [95% CI, 1.15-1.58]; weighted odds ratio, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.11-1.33]).  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that Black patients with cancer experience worse COVID-19 outcomes compared with White patients. Understanding and addressing racial inequities within the causal framework of structural racism is essential to reduce the disproportionate burden of diseases, such as COVID-19 and cancer, in Black patients.""","""['Julie Fu', 'Sonya A Reid', 'Benjamin French', 'Cassandra Hennessy', 'Clara Hwang', 'Na Tosha Gatson', 'Narjust Duma', 'Sanjay Mishra', 'Ryan Nguyen', 'Jessica E Hawley', 'Sunny R K Singh', 'David D Chism', 'Neeta K Venepalli', 'Jeremy L Warner', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Andrew L Schmidt', 'Leslie A Fecher', 'Jennifer E Girard', 'Mehmet A Bilen', 'Deepak Ravindranathan', 'Sharad Goyal', 'Trisha M Wise-Draper', 'Cathleen Park', 'Corrie A Painter', 'Sheila M McGlown', 'Gilberto de Lima Lopes Jr', 'Oscar K Serrano', 'Dimpy P Shah;COVID- and Cancer Consortium (CCC)']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Error in Supplement 2.', 'Characteristics Associated With Racial/Ethnic Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes in an Academic Health Care System.', 'Assessment of Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Hospitalization and Mortality in Patients With COVID-19 in New York City.', ""Racial and Ethnic Differences in Presentation and Outcomes for Patients Hospitalized With COVID-19: Findings From the American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry."", 'Analysis of Residential Segregation and Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Severe Maternal Morbidity Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Racial Disparities in Incidence and Outcomes Among Patients With COVID-19.', 'Comparison of thrombotic and clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2-pneumonia versus other viral pneumonia in an urban academic medical center.', 'COVID-19 in cancer patients: update from the joint analysis of the ESMO-CoCARE, BSMO, and PSMO international databases.', 'Disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 in a large US city.', 'Early COVID-19 Hospitalizations Among New York State Residents with a History of Invasive Cancer.', 'Clinical Characteristics, Racial Inequities, and Outcomes in Patients with Breast Cancer and COVID-19: A COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) Cohort Study.']"""

Objective:   To report the first dedicated series of spine SBRT specific to prostate cancer (PCa) metastases with outcomes reported according to hormone sensitivity status.  Methods:   A prospective database was reviewed identifying patients with PCa treated with spine SBRT. This included those with hormone-sensitive PCa (HSPC) and castrate-resistant PCa (CRPC). The primary end point was MRI-based local control (LC).  Results:   A total of 183 spine segments in 93 patients were identified; 146 segments had no prior radiation and 37 had been previously radiated; 27 segments were postoperative. The median follow-up was 31 months. At the time of SBRT, 50 patients had HSPC and the remaining 43 had CRPC. The most common fractionation scheme was 24-28 Gy in 2 SBRT fractions (76%). LC rates at 1 and 2 years were 99% and 95% and 94% and 78% for the HSPC and CRPC cohorts, respectively. For patients treated with de novo SBRT, a higher risk of local failure was observed in patients with CRPC (P = .0425). The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were significantly longer at 98% and 95% in the HSPC cohort compared with 79% and 65% in the CRPC cohort (P = .0005).

It remains unclear which strategy is most effective. Therefore, we evaluated two risk assessment pathways commonly used in clinical practice.  Objective:   To compare the diagnostic performance of a risk-based ultrasound (US)-directed pathway (Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator [RPCRC] #3; US volume assessment) and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-directed pathway.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a prospective multicenter study (MR-PROPER) with 1:1 allocation among 21 centers (US arm in 11 centers, MRI arm in ten). Biopsy-naïve men with suspicion of prostate cancer (age ≥50 yr, prostate-specific antigen 3.0-50 ng/ml, ± abnormal digital rectal examination) were included.  Intervention:   Biopsy-naïve men with elevated risk of prostate cancer, determined using RPCRC#3 in the US arm and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System scores of 3-5 in the MRI arm, underwent systematic biopsies (US arm) or targeted biopsies (MRI arm).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was the proportion of men with grade group (GG) ≥2 cancer. Secondary outcomes were the proportions of biopsies avoided and GG 1 cancers detected. Categorical (nonparametric) data were assessed using the Mann-Whitney U test and χ2 tests.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1965 men were included in the intention-to-treat population (US arm n = 950, MRI arm n = 1015). The US and MRI pathways detected GG ≥2 cancers equally well (235/950, 25% vs 239/1015, 24%; difference 1.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6% to 5.0%; p = 0.5). The US pathway detected more GG 1 cancers than the MRI pathway (121/950, 13% vs 84/1015, 8.3%; difference 4.5%, 95% CI 1.8-7.2%; p < 0.01). The US pathway avoided fewer biopsies than the MRI pathway (403/950, 42% vs 559/1015, 55%; difference -13%, 95% CI -17% to -8.3%; p < 0.01). Among men with elevated risk, more GG ≥2 cancers were detected in the MRI group than in the US group (52% vs 43%; difference 9.2%, 95% CI 3.0-15%; p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   Risk-adapted US-directed and MRI-directed pathways detected GG ≥2 cancers equally well. The risk-adapted US-directed pathway performs well for prostate cancer diagnosis if prostate MRI capacity and expertise are not available. If prostate MRI availability is sufficient, risk assessment should preferably be performed using MRI, as this avoids more biopsies and detects fewer cases of GG 1 cancer.  Patient summary:   Among men with suspected prostate cancer, relevant cancers were equally well detected by risk-based pathways using either ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to guide biopsy of the prostate. If prostate MRI availability is sufficient, risk assessment should be performed with MRI to reduce unnecessary biopsies and detect fewer irrelevant cancers.""","""['Ivo M Wagensveld', 'Daniel F Osses', 'Pieter M Groenendijk', 'Frank M Zijta', 'Martijn B Busstra', 'Elena Rociu', 'Jelle O Barentsz', 'J P Michiel Sedelaar', 'Berber Arbeel', 'Ton Roeleveld', 'Remy Geenen', 'Ingrid Koeter', 'Saskia A van der Meer', 'Vincent Cappendijk', 'Rik Somford', 'Sjoerd Klaver', 'Hans Van der Lely', 'Tineke Wolters', 'Willem Hellings', 'Maicle R Leter', 'Henk G Van der Poel', 'Stijn W T P J Heijmink', 'Frans Debruyne', 'Jos Immerzeel', 'Joost Leijte', 'Joep van Roermund', 'Razvan Miclea', 'Erik Planken', 'André N Vis', 'Igle Jan de Jong', 'Jasper Tijsterman', 'Derk Wolterbeek', 'Anoesjka Claessen', 'Eric Vrijhof', 'Joost Nederend', 'Geert J L H Van Leenders', 'Chris H Bangma', 'Gabriel P Krestin', 'Sebastiaan Remmers', 'Ivo G Schoots;MR-PROPER Study Group']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment in Biopsy-naïve Patients: The Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator in Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) Fusion Biopsy and Systematic TRUS Biopsy.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Comparison of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Biopsy With Systematic Transrectal Ultrasonography Biopsy for Biopsy-Naive Men at Risk for Prostate Cancer: A Phase 3 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Prospective Evaluation of PI-RADS Version 2.1 for Prostate Cancer Detection and Investigation of Multiparametric MRI-derived Markers.', 'Common errors, pitfalls, and management of complications of prostate biopsy : The most common diagnostic and procedural challenges of transrectal fusion prostate biopsy in the initial diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Systematic or targeted fusion-guided biopsy.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsy Compared with Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Patients with Suspected Prostate Cancer.']"""

In this regard, herein rapid, selective and highly efficient chromo-fluorogenic detection of ammonia/aliphatic amines over aromatic amines has been investigated by means of a novel ""opto-electronic nose"", CN-2, synthesized in a single-step via multiple inter/intramolecular C-N fusion reactions. The in-situ generated mono-protonated CN-2 can selectively detect primary to secondary to even tertiary aliphatic amines over aromatic amines within ∼40 S with extremely low detection threshold values of 27.2 ppb, 0.7 ppm, 5.4 ppm, 1.7 ppm from UV-Vis and 42.5 ppb, 1.61 ppm, 5.5 ppm, 6.14 ppm from fluorescence spectral data for NH3, hydrazine (primary amine), diethanolamine (secondary amine) and triethylamine (tertiary amine) respectively with the hypsochromic shift in the UV-Vis spectra along with fluorescence attenuation via target-specific deprotonation. The colorimetric signal can also be examined by Smartphone APP, which is well correlated with spectrophotometric outcomes. Interestingly, due to presence of a unique protonated antenna centre CN-2 with anti-oxidant activity can also detect aliphatic biogenic amines, like putrescine, spermidine, which are frequently released from spoiled food. Therefore, it may be exploited as smart food-spoilage indicator in real-time. Again, the aliphatic biogenic amines recognition capability from human urine made it as a potential prostate cancer biomarker sensor for clinical use, which alleviates the need of biopsies. CN-2 could also be employed towards one-to-two decoder logic-circuitry formulation to monitor the ammonia levels. Moreover, CN-2-functionalized hydrogel-membrane based portable, handy prototype could be utilized for easy on-site recognition of amine vapour. Reversible sensing behaviour in presence of HCl enables CN-2 to exhibit anti-counterfeiting activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first all-in-one phenazine-based Smartphone-assisted chromo-fluorogenic-chemosensor, which would be of enormous interest in food-packaging industry, information technology as well as in early-stage-cancer diagnosis.""","""['Riyanka Das', 'Sourav Bej', 'Naresh Chandra Murmu', 'Priyabrata Banerjee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anal Chim Acta""","""['In-situ food spoilage monitoring using a wireless chemical receptor-conjugated graphene electronic nose.', 'A non-porous Fe(II) complex for the colorimetric detection of hazardous gases and the monitoring of meat freshness.', 'Colorimetric Paper Sensor for Food Spoilage Based on Biogenic Amine Monitoring.', 'Control of biogenic amines in food--existing and emerging approaches.', 'Recent Progress in Amine Gas Sensors for Food Quality Monitoring: Novel Architectures for Sensing Materials and Systems.', 'Detection and Quantification of Ammonia as the Ammonium Cation in Human Saliva by 1H NMR: A Promising Probe for Health Status Monitoring, with Special Reference to Cancer.']"""
