Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine disrupting compound that can interfere with endocrine hormone functioning and thereby influence prostate development. The objective of this study was to examine the impact on prostate expression of aromatase, 5α-R isozymes, and prostate cancer-related genes of exposure to low doses of BPA from perinatal period to adulthood. Vehicle or BPA (2.5 μg/kg b.w./day) was administered to gestating Wistar rats from gestational day 12 (GD12) to parturition and then to their male pups from postnatal day 1 (PND1) until euthanization on PND90. Their prostate glands were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, PCR array, and morphological study. mRNA and protein levels of 5α-R2 were significantly reduced and mRNA and protein levels of aromatase were significantly increased in BPA-treated animals, which also showed modifications of 8 out of the 84 key genes implicated in the development of prostate cancer. Because BPA interferes with genes involved in intraprostatic androgen and estrogen production and others implicated in prostate cancer, research is warranted into the prostate disease risk associated with chronic low-dose BPA exposure throughout life.""","""['Pilar Sánchez', 'Beatriz Castro', 'Sergio Martínez-Rodríguez', 'Rosa Ríos-Pelegrina', 'Raimundo G Del Moral', 'Jesús M Torres', 'Esperanza Ortega']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Effects of perinatal exposure to bisphenol A on the intraprostatic levels of aromatase and 5α-reductase isozymes in juvenile rats.', 'Bisphenol A exposure during adulthood alters expression of aromatase and 5α-reductase isozymes in rat prostate.', 'Bisphenol A modifies the regulation exerted by testosterone on 5 α -reductase isozymes in ventral prostate of adult rats.', '5alpha-reductase isozymes and androgen actions in the prostate.', 'Estrogen and androgen signaling in the pathogenesis of BPH.', 'Effects of perinatal exposure to bisphenol A on induction of prostate cancer in Sprague Dawley rats by MNU and testosterone.']"""

Signal transducer and transcription activator 3 (STAT3) plays a role in many biological processes, including cell life and proliferation, the acute phase response, chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, metabolism, and cancer progression, It is also known to be a prooncogenic transcription factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent proangiogenic stimuli ever identified. It mediates tumor neovascularization, and is associated with angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) folate hydrolase I, despite its name, has been found in tissues other than the prostate. It is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and several other cancers, and has the potential to be a target for radioligand therapy. We investigated the value of STAT3, VEGF and PSMA immunohistochemical expression patterns and their effects on survival in MPNSTs, GBMs, and MMs. Their expression patterns were evaluated in 25 MPNSTs, 27 GBMs, and 25 MM cases. All GBM cases stained positively for STAT3 and VEGF. In the other groups, the staining patterns were heterogeneous. None of the cases showed positive staining with PSMA. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between cases with differing VEGF and STAT3 staining patterns in the MPSNT and MM groups, but there was an increase in mortality as the VEGF score increased in the GBM group. The suppression of VEGF and STAT3 may be a promising avenue for treatment of MPNSTs, GBMs, and MMs, although further research is needed.""","""['Sinem Kantarcioglu Coskun', 'Mehmet Gamsizkan', 'Ulvıye Yalcınkaya', 'Mehmet Alı Sungur']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol""","""['Prostate-specific membrane antigen as a potential novel vascular target for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in tumor-associated vasculature of breast cancers.', 'The role of vascular endothelial growth factors and their receptors in malignant melanomas.', 'Therapeutic targeting of VEGF in the treatment of glioblastoma.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen PET: Clinical Utility in Prostate Cancer, Normal Patterns, Pearls, and Pitfalls.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a potential target for molecular imaging and treatment in bone and soft tissue sarcomas.']"""

We present the first multi-institutional study to further assess the perioperative and postoperative outcomes of SP RASP.  Materials and methods:   From February 2019 to November 2021, 91 consecutive patients of 3 separate institutions underwent transvesical RASP using the da Vinci® SP robotic surgical system. Surgeries were performed by 3 experienced surgeons. Through a suprapubic incision and transvesical access, the SP robot is docked directly into the bladder, and the prostatic enucleation is performed. Prospective data collection, including baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative outcomes, was performed. The mean followup period was 4.6 months.  Results:   The mean (SD) prostate volume was 156 (62) ml. The mean (SD) total operative time was 159 (45) minutes, and the median (IQR) estimated blood loss was 100 (50, 200) cc. The median (IQR) postoperative hospital stay was 21.0 (6.5, 26.0) hours; however, 42% of all patients were discharged the same day. The median (IQR) Foley catheter duration was 5 (5, 7) days.

We examined the association between family history of prostate cancer (FHP) or family history of cancer (FHC) and risk of progression or adverse pathology at radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients on AS.  Materials and methods:   Patients on AS at a single tertiary-care center between 2000-2019 were categorized by family history. Disease progression was defined as an increase in Gleason grade on biopsy. Adverse pathology was defined as upgrading/upstaging at RP. Multivariable Cox and logistic regression models were used to assess association between family history and time to progression or adverse pathology, respectively.  Results:   Among 3,211 evaluable patients, 669 (21%) had FHP, 34 (1%) had FHC and 95 (3%) had both; 753 progressed on AS and 481 underwent RP. FHP was associated with increased risk of progression (HR 1.31; 95% CI, 1.11-1.55; p=0.002) but FHC (HR 0.67; 95% CI, 0.30-1.50; p=0.3) or family history of both (HR 1.22; 95% CI, 0.81-1.85; p=0.3) were not. FHP, FHC or both were not associated with adverse pathology at RP (p >0.4).  Conclusions:   While FHP was associated with an increased risk of progression on AS, wide confidence intervals render this outcome of unclear clinical significance. FHC was not associated with risk of progression on AS. In the absence of known genetically defined hereditary cancer syndrome, we suggest FHP and/or FHC should not be used as a sole trigger to preclude patients from enrolling on AS.""","""['Ghalib A Jibara', 'Marlon Perera', 'Emily A Vertosick', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Peter T Scardino', 'James A Eastham', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Karim Touijer', 'Xin Lin', 'Maria I Carlo', 'Behfar Ehdaie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['In the Genetic Era Family History Is Just Not Enough!!!', 'Impact of an Expanded Definition of Family History on Outcomes of Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer.', 'Immediate versus delayed radical prostatectomy: updated outcomes following active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'The Natural History of Untreated Biopsy Grade Group Progression and Delayed Definitive Treatment for Men on Active Surveillance for Early-Stage Prostate Cancer.', 'Population based study of predictors of adverse pathology among candidates for active surveillance with Gleason 6 prostate cancer.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.']"""

We sought to characterize how physicians communicate the 3 components of competing risks-life expectancy (LE), cancer prognosis and treatment-related survival benefit-in treatment consultations.  Materials and methods:   Conversation related to LE, cancer prognosis and treatment-related survival benefit was identified in transcripts from treatment consultations of 42 men with low- and intermediate-risk disease across 10 multidisciplinary providers. Consensus of qualitative coding by multiple reviewers noted the most detailed mode of communication used to describe each throughout the consultation.  Results:   Physicians frequently failed to provide patient-specific, quantitative estimates of LE and cancer mortality. LE was omitted in 17% of consultations, expressed as a generalization (eg ""long""/""short"") in 17%, rough number of years in 31%, probability of mortality/survival at an arbitrary timepoint in 17% and in only 19% as a specific number of years. Cancer mortality was omitted in 24% of consultations, expressed as a generalization in 7%, years of expected life in 2%, probability at no/arbitrary timepoint in 40% and in only 26% as the probability at LE. Treatment-related survival benefit was often omitted; cancer mortality was reported without treatment in 38%, with treatment in 10% and in only 29% both with and without treatment. Physicians achieved ""trifecta""-1) quantifying probability of cancer mortality 2) with and without treatment 3) at the patient's LE-in only 14% of consultations.

Emergence of recent critical clinical data and changes in surgical equipment costs due to their shared use by different clinical specialties necessitate an updated cost-effectiveness analysis in a centralized, largely government-funded health care system such as the UK National Health Service (NHS).  Objective:   To compare robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) with open radical prostatectomy (ORP) and laparoscopic-assisted radical prostatectomy (LRP) using contemporary data on clinical outcomes, costs, and surgical volumes in the UK.  Design, setting, and participants:   This economic analysis used a Markov model developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of RARP, LRP, and ORP to treat localized prostate cancer. The model was constructed from the perspective of the UK NHS. The model simulated 65-year-old men who underwent radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer and were followed up for a 10-year period. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2020, to July 31, 2021.  Exposures:   Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, LRP, and ORP.  Main outcomes and measures:   Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (direct medical costs and costs outside the NHS), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).  Results:   Compared with LRP, RARP cost £1785 (US $2350) less and had 0.24 more QALYs gained; thus, RARP was a dominant option compared with LRP. Compared with ORP, RARP had 0.12 more QALYs gained but cost £526 (US $693) more during the 10-year time frame, resulting in an ICER of £4293 (US $5653)/QALY. Because the ICER was below the £30 000 (US $39 503) willingness-to-pay threshold, RARP was more cost-effective than ORP in the UK. The most sensitive variable influencing the cost-effectiveness of RARP was the lower risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR). Scenario analysis indicated RARP would remain more cost-effective than ORP as long as the BCR hazard ratios comparing RARP vs ORP were less than 0.99.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that in the UK, RARP has an ICER lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold and thus is likely a cost-effective surgical treatment option for patients with localized prostate cancer compared with ORP and LRP. The results were mainly driven by the lower risk of BCR for RARP. These findings may differ in other health care settings where different thresholds and costs may apply.""","""['Muhieddine Labban', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Chao Song', 'Russell Becker', 'Yanli Li', 'Usha Seshadri Kreaden', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Cost-effectiveness of Robotic-Assisted Prostatectomy in the UK-Are We Doing Enough?', 'Patterns-of-care and health economic analysis of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the Australian public health system.', 'Systematic literature review of cost-effectiveness analyses of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of 1-Year Health Care Costs and Use Associated With Open vs Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients: A System Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Surgical outcomes and cost analysis of a multi-specialty robotic-assisted surgery caseload in the Australian public health system.']"""

Methods:   Patients undergoing robotic beyond TME resections for primary or recurrent pelvic malignancy between July 2015 and July 2021 in a public quaternary and a private tertiary centre were included. Demographic and clinical data were recorded and outcomes analysed.  Results:   Twenty-four patients (50% males) were included, with a median age of 58 (45-70.8) years, and a BMI of 26 (24.3-28.1) kg/m2 . Indication for surgery was rectal adenocarcinoma in nineteen, leiomyosarcoma in two, anal squamous cell carcinoma in one and combined rectal and prostatic adenocarcinoma in two patients. All patients required resection of at least one adjacent pelvic organ including genitourinary structures (n = 23), internal iliac vessels (n = 3) and/or bone (n = 2). Eleven patients had a restorative procedure. Of the 13 nonrestorative cases, nine needed perineal reconstruction with a flap. There was one conversion due to bleeding. The mean operating time was 370 (285-424) min, and the median blood loss was 400 (200-2,000) ml. The median length of stay was 16 (9.3-23.8) days. Fourteen patients (58.3%) had postoperative complications; eight of them (33.3%) were Clavien-Dindo III or more complication. Twenty-three (95.8%) patients had an R0 resection.

Of 2565 participants, 1135 men received active monitoring (AM), 750 a radical prostatectomy (RP), 603 external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) with concurrent androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and 77 low-dose-rate brachytherapy (BT, not a randomised treatment). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) completed annually for 6 years were analysed by initial treatment and censored for subsequent treatments. Mixed effects models were adjusted for baseline characteristics using propensity scores.  Results:   Treatment-received analyses revealed different impacts of treatments over 6 years. Men remaining on AM experienced gradual declines in sexual and urinary function with age (e.g., increases in erectile dysfunction from 35% of men at baseline to 53% at 6 years and nocturia similarly from 20% to 38%). Radical treatment impacts were immediate and continued over 6 years.

Patients and methods:   The 2-part phase I/II KEYNOTE-046 study enrolled men with mCRPC who have progressed after 2 or fewer prior systemic treatment regimens in the metastatic setting. In Part A, intravenous ADXS31-142 monotherapy was given every 3 weeks (q3w) to 3 dose-escalation cohorts. In Part B, ADXS31-142 (1 × 109 colony-forming units) plus pembrolizumab (200 mg) was administered intravenously q3w for 3 doses with a fourth pembrolizumab dose 3 weeks later (12-week cycles) for up to 24 months or until progression/toxicity. Endpoints included safety, overall response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and immunogenicity.  Results:   Fifty patients received ADXS31-142 alone (n = 13) or with pembrolizumab (n = 37). Among the 37 RECIST-evaluable patients (n = 8 Part A; n = 29 Part B), there were no objective responses. Median PFS was 2.2 months (95% CI: 0.8-7.4) with monotherapy and 5.4 months (95% CI: 2.3-7.9) with the combination; median OS was 7.8 months (95% CI: 4.4-18.5) and 33.7 months (95% CI: 15.4-not evaluable), respectively. Promising OS benefit was observed in combination-treated patients who had received prior docetaxel (16.0 months, 95% CI: 6.4-34.6; n = 20) and those with visceral metastasis (16.4 months, 95% CI 4.0-not evaluable; n = 11).

However, the expression pattern and prognostic values of HOXA genes in PCa have not been investigated. In this study, we analyzed TCGA datasets and identified six HOXA family members which showed a dysregulated expression in PCa specimens compared with nontumor specimens. We also explored the potential mechanisms involved in the dysregulation of HOXA family members in PCa, and the results of Pearson's correlation revealed that most HOXA members were negatively related to the methylation degree. Moreover, we explored the prognostic values of HOXA family members and identified six survival-related HOXA members. Importantly, HOXA2, HOXA9, and HOXA10 were identified as critical PCa-related genes which were abnormally expressed in PCa and associated with clinical outcomes of PCa patients. Then, we explored the association between the above three genes and immune cell infiltration. We observed that the levels of HOXA2, HOXA9, and HOXA10 were associated with the levels of immune infiltration of several kinds of immune cells.

Activation of the kynurenine pathway enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) modulates cellular activity in the brain, tolerogenesis in the immune system and is a major checkpoint in cancer development. We now report that IDO1 mRNA and IDO1 protein expression (generating kynurenine) are induced in human monocyte-derived macrophages by several chymotryptic serine proteases with direct links to tumorigenesis, including Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA), CD26 (Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, CD26/DPP-4), High Temperature Requirement protein-A (HtrA), and the bacterial virulence factor subtilisin. These proteases also induce expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine genes IL1B and IL6. Other serine proteases tested: bacterial glu-C endopeptidase and mammalian Pro-protein Convertase Subtilase-Kexin-3 (PCSK3, furin), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), cathepsin G or neutrophil elastase, did not induce IDO1, indicating that the reported effects are not a general property of all serine proteases. The results represent a novel mechanism of activating immunosuppressive IDO1 and inducing kynurenine generation which, together with the production of inflammatory cytokines, would contribute to tumour initiation and progression, providing a new target for drug development. In addition, the proteasomal S20 serine protease inhibitor carfilzomib, used in the treatment of myeloma, prevented the induction of IDO1 and cytokine gene expression, potentially contributing to its clinical anti-cancer activity.""","""['Felix I L Clanchy', 'Yi-Shu Huang', 'Joy Ogbechi', 'L Gail Darlington', 'Richard O Williams', 'Trevor W Stone']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Tryptophan: A Rheostat of Cancer Immune Escape Mediated by Immunosuppressive Enzymes IDO1 and TDO.', 'Galectin 3 protects from cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury by promoting TLR-2-dependent activation of IDO1/Kynurenine pathway in renal DCs.', 'Non-tumor cell IDO1 predominantly contributes to enzyme activity and response to CTLA-4/PD-L1 inhibition in mouse glioblastoma.', 'An Autocrine Cytokine/JAK/STAT-Signaling Induces Kynurenine Synthesis in Multidrug Resistant Human Cancer Cells.', 'Role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in health and disease.', 'An integrated cytokine and kynurenine network as the basis of neuroimmune communication.', 'Modulation of immune cell function, IDO expression and kynurenine production by the quorum sensor 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS).', 'CD26 and Cancer.', 'Prognostic role of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 expression in solid tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The efficacy of prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in recurrent cancer has not been established. Furthermore, high-quality data on new minimally invasive salvage focal ablative treatments are needed.  Objective:   To evaluate the role of prostate MRI in detection of prostate cancer recurring after radiotherapy and the role of salvage focal ablation in treating recurrent disease.  Design, setting, and participants:   The FORECAST trial was both a paired-cohort diagnostic study evaluating prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and MRI-targeted biopsies in the detection of recurrent cancer and a cohort study evaluating focal ablation at six UK centres. A total of 181 patients were recruited, with 155 included in the MRI analysis and 93 in the focal ablation analysis.  Intervention:   Patients underwent choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography and a bone scan, followed by prostate mpMRI and MRI-targeted and transperineal template-mapping (TTPM) biopsies. MRI was reported blind to other tests. Those eligible underwent subsequent focal ablation. An amendment in December 2014 permitted focal ablation in patients with metastases.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Primary outcomes were the sensitivity of MRI and MRI-targeted biopsies for cancer detection, and urinary incontinence after focal ablation. A key secondary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS).  Results and limitations:   Staging whole-body imaging revealed localised cancer in 128 patients (71%), with involvement of pelvic nodes only in 13 (7%) and metastases in 38 (21%). The sensitivity of MRI-targeted biopsy was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI] 83-97%). The specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 75% (95% CI 45-92%), 94% (95% CI 86-98%), and 65% (95% CI 38-86%), respectively. Four cancer (6%) were missed by TTPM biopsy and six (8%) were missed by MRI-targeted biopsy. The overall MRI sensitivity for detection of any cancer was 94% (95% CI 88-98%). The specificity and positive and negative predictive values were 18% (95% CI 7-35%), 80% (95% CI 73-87%), and 46% (95% CI 19-75%), respectively. Among 93 patients undergoing focal ablation, urinary incontinence occurred in 15 (16%) and five (5%) had a grade ≥3 adverse event, with no rectal injuries. Median follow-up was 27 mo (interquartile range 18-36); overall PFS was 66% (interquartile range 54-75%) at 24 mo.  Conclusions:   Patients should undergo prostate MRI with both systematic and targeted biopsies to optimise cancer detection. Focal ablation for areas of intraprostatic recurrence preserves continence in the majority, with good early cancer control.  Patient summary:   We investigated the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the prostate and MRI-targeted biopsies in outcomes after cancer-targeted high-intensity ultrasound or cryotherapy in patients with recurrent cancer after radiotherapy. Our findings show that these patients should undergo prostate MRI with both systematic and targeted biopsies and then ablative treatment focused on areas of recurrent cancer to preserve their quality of life.

To overcome this, we hypothesize that conjugating lactoferrin, a tumor-targeting ligand, and the diaminobutyric polypropylenimine dendrimer into gold nanocages, followed by complexation with a plasmid DNA, would enhance gene expression and anti-proliferation activity in prostate cancer cells without the use of external stimuli.  Methods:   Novel gold nanocages bearing lactoferrin and conjugated to diaminobutyric polypropylenimine dendrimer (AuNCs-DAB-Lf) were synthesized and characterized. Following complexation with a plasmid DNA, their gene expression, cellular uptake and anti-proliferative efficacies were evaluated on PC-3 prostate cancer cells.  Results:   AuNCs-DAB-Lf was able to complex DNA at conjugate: DNA weight ratios 5:1 onwards. Gene expression was at its highest after treatment with AuNCs-DAB-Lf at a weight ratio of 10:1, as a result of a significant increase in DNA uptake mediated by the conjugate at that ratio in PC-3 cells. Consequently, the anti-proliferative activity of AuNCs-DAB-Lf-DNA encoding TNFα was significantly improved by up to 9-fold compared with DAB dendriplex encoding TNFα.

MSH2 has also been reported to take part in the progresses of various tumors' formation. With the help of GTEx, CCLE, and TCGA pan-cancer databases, the analysis of MSH2 gene distribution in both tumor tissues and normal control tissues was carried out. Kaplan-Meyer survival plots and COX regression analysis were conducted for the assessment into the MSH2's impact on tumor patients' clinical prognosis. In an investigation to the association of MSH2 expression with immune infiltration level of various tumors and a similar study on tumor immune neoantigens, microsatellite instability was subsequently taken. It was found that high expression of MSH2 is prevalent in most cancers. MSH2's efficacy on clinical prognosis as well as immune infiltration in tumor patients revealed a fact that expression of MSH2 in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), brain lower-grade glioma (LGG), breast-invasive carcinoma (BRCA), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) posed a significant correlation with the immune cell infiltration level of patients. Likewise as above, MSH2's expression comes in a similar trend with tumor immune neoantigens and microsatellite instability. MSH2's expression in the majority of tumors is a direct factor to the activation of tumor-associated pathways as well as immune-associated pathways.

While Panax notoginseng has been used as an anti-cancer medicinal herb in recent years, how it achieves this therapeutic effect has not been thoroughly elucidated. The purpose of this study was to reveal more about the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of Panax notoginseng on prostate cancer (PCa) cells.  Methods:   Ethanol extract of Panax notoginseng root was authenticated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The cytotoxic activity of this herb against PCa cells was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method, flow cytometry, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Results:   The assessment of cellular metabolic activity demonstrated that Panax notoginseng reduces the viability of LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin-V binding flow cytometry assay showed that Panax notoginseng induces apoptosis in PCa cells. Cell cycle analysis by quantification of DNA content using flow cytometry showed that Panax notoginseng arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase in both LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. Moreover, ELISA demonstrated that Panax notoginseng-treated PCa cells secrete significantly less tumor-promoting cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) to the supernatant compared with controls.  Conclusions:   These results provide evidence for the cytotoxic effects of Panax notoginseng on PCa cell lines. This botanical is a promising candidate for the complementary and integrative medicine treatment of PCa and further studies are indicated to determine the anti-cancer mechanism of Panax notoginseng.""","""['Benjamin Hawthorne', 'Kaleb Lund', 'Sydney Freggiaro', 'Risa Kaga', 'Jing Meng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Detection of adulteration of notoginseng root extract with other panax species by quantitative HPLC coupled with PCA.', 'Anti-diabetic potential of Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS): a review.', 'Panax notoginseng saponins attenuate lung cancer growth in part through modulating the level of Met/miR-222 axis.', 'Panax notoginseng saponins provide neuroprotection by regulating NgR1/RhoA/ROCK2 pathway expression, in vitro and in vivo.', 'Advances in pharmacological studies of Panax notoginseng saponins on brain ischemia-reperfusion injury.', 'Extraction, Structural, and Antioxidant Properties of Oligosaccharides Hydrolyzed from Panax notoginseng by Ultrasonic-Assisted Fenton Degradation.', 'Study of the suitable climate factors and geographical origins traceability of Panax notoginseng based on correlation analysis and spectral images combined with machine learning.', 'The therapeutic potential of natural products for treating pancreatic cancer.', 'Characterization of a novel thermophilic beta-glucosidase from Thermotoga sp. and its application in the transformation of notoginsenoside R1.']"""

The CT alone group was older relative to the MRI group (69.9 vs 67.2, p < 0.001) and had higher risk and grade disease (p < 0.001). Additionally, the CT group exhibited a trend in larger CTVs (82.56 cc vs 76.90 cc; p = 0.055), lower total radiation doses (p = 0.048), and more frequent pelvic nodal radiation versus the MRI group (p < 0.001). There were only two reported cases of Grade 3 + toxicity within the CT alone group. Quality of life data within the CT alone group revealed declines in urinary and bowel scores at one month with return to baseline at subsequent follow up. Early biochemical failure data at median time of 2.3 years revealed five failures by Phoenix definition.  Conclusions:   While clinical differences existed between the MRI and CT alone group, we observed tolerable toxicity profiles in the CT alone cohort, which was further supported by EPIC questionnaire data. The overall clinical outcomes appear comparable in patients unable to receive MRI for their SBRT treatment plan with early clinical follow up.""","""['Katherine Amarell', 'Anna Jaysing', 'Christopher Mendez', 'Jonathan A Haas', 'Seth R Blacksburg', 'Aaron E Katz', 'Astrid Sanchez', 'Angela Tong', 'Todd Carpenter', 'Matthew Witten', 'Sean P Collins', 'Jonathan W Lischalk']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided vs Computed Tomography-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: The MIRAGE Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (mirage): a phase iii randomized trial.', 'Biochemical Control and Toxicity Outcomes of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Versus Low-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy in the Treatment of Low- and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer in men with large prostates (≥50 cm(3)).', 'A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.']"""

In this work we use an explainable deep learning model to interpret the predictions of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for prostate tumor segmentation. The CNN uses a U-Net architecture which was trained on multi-parametric MRI data from 122 patients to automatically segment the prostate gland and prostate tumor lesions. In addition, co-registered ground truth data from whole mount histopathology images were available in 15 patients that were used as a test set during CNN testing. To be able to interpret the segmentation results of the CNN, heat maps were generated using the Gradient Weighted Class Activation Map (Grad-CAM) method. The CNN achieved a mean Dice Sorensen Coefficient 0.62 and 0.31 for the prostate gland and the tumor lesions -with the radiologist drawn ground truth and 0.32 with whole-mount histology ground truth for tumor lesions. Dice Sorensen Coefficient between CNN predictions and manual segmentations from MRI and histology data were not significantly different.

Based on the observation that most local recurrences occurred near the tumor bed, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI), consisting of a higher dose per fraction to the tumor bed over a reduced treatment time, has been gaining ground as an attractive alternative in selected patients with low-risk BC. Although more widely delivered in postoperative setting, preoperative APBI has also been investigated in a limited, though increasing, and number of studies. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, safety and efficacy of preoperative radiotherapy (RT) in a single fraction for selected BC patients.  Methods:   This is a phase I/II, single-arm and open-label single-center clinical trial using CyberKnife. The clinical investigation is supported by a preplanning section which addresses technical and dosimetric issues. The primary endpoint for the phase I study, covering the 1st and 2nd year of the research project, is the identification of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which meets a specific target toxicity level (no grade 3-4 toxicity). The primary endpoint for the phase II study (3rd to 5th year) is the evaluation of treatment efficacy measured in terms of pathological complete response rate.  Discussion:   The study will investigate the response of BC to the preoperative APBI from different perspectives. While preoperative APBI represents a form of anticipated boost, followed by WBRT, different are the implications for the scientific community. The study may help to identify good responders for whom surgery could be omitted. It is especially appealing for patients unfit for surgery due to advanced age or severe co-morbidities, in addition to or instead of systemic therapies, to ensure long-term local control. Moreover, patients with oligometastatic disease synchronous with primary BC may benefit from APBI on the intact tumor in terms of tumor progression free survival. The study of response to RT can provide useful information about BC radiobiology, immunologic reactions, genomic expression, and radiomics features, to be tested on a larger scale.  Trial registration:   The study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04679454 ).""","""['Maria Alessia Zerella', 'Mattia Zaffaroni', 'Giuseppe Ronci', 'Samantha Dicuonzo', 'Damaris Patricia Rojas', 'Anna Morra', 'Cristiana Fodor', 'Elena Rondi', 'Sabrina Vigorito', 'Francesca Botta', 'Marta Cremonesi', 'Cristina Garibaldi', 'Silvia Penco', 'Viviana Enrica Galimberti', 'Mattia Intra', 'Sara Gandini', 'Massimo Barberis', 'Giuseppe Renne', 'Federica Cattani', 'Paolo Veronesi', 'Roberto Orecchia', 'Barbara Alicja Jereczek-Fossa', 'Maria Cristina Leonardi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer.', 'Partial breast irradiation for early breast cancer.', 'Late side-effects and cosmetic results of accelerated partial breast irradiation with interstitial brachytherapy versus whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery for low-risk invasive and in-situ carcinoma of the female breast: 5-year results of a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial.', 'Redefining radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer with single dose ablative treatment: a study protocol.', 'Accelerated partial breast irradiation using intensity modulated radiotherapy versus whole breast irradiation: Health-related quality of life final analysis from the Florence phase 3 trial.', 'Partial Breast Irradiation.']"""

During the 2020-2021 academic year, we held eight 45-min sessions in an ambulatory noon conference series for a community family medicine (FM) and internal medicine (IM) residency program. The curriculum used Project ECHO®, an interactive model of tele-education through Zoom video conferencing, to connect trainees with specialists. Each session had a cancer-specific focus (e.g., breast cancer survivorship) and incorporated a range of core survivorship topics (e.g., surveillance, treatment effects). The session format included a resident case presentation and didactic lecture by an expert discussant. Residents completed pre- and post-curricular surveys to assess for changes in attitude, confidence, practice patterns, and/or knowledge in cancer survivorship care. Of 67 residents, 23/24 FM and 41/43 IM residents participated in the curriculum. Residents attended a mean of 3 sessions. By the end of the curriculum, resident confidence in survivorship topics (surveillance, treatment effects, genetic risk assessment) increased for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers (p < 0.05), and there was a trend toward residents stating they ask patients more often about cancer treatment effects (p = 0.07). Over 90% of residents found various curricular components useful, and over 80% reported that the curriculum would improve their practice of cancer-related testing and treatment-related monitoring. On a 15-question post-curricular knowledge check, the mean correct score was 9.4 (63%).

This analysis was conducted to describe pharmacokinetics of apalutamide and N-desmethyl-apalutamide and explore relationships between apalutamide exposure and selected clinical efficacy and safety observations.  Methods:   1052 patients were randomized to apalutamide + ADT (n = 525) or placebo + ADT (n = 527). A previously developed population pharmacokinetic model was applied. Cox regression analysis investigated the relationships between apalutamide exposure and overall survival (OS; n = 1004) and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS; n = 1003). Logistic regression analysis assessed the relationships between apalutamide exposure and selected clinically relevant adverse events (n = 1051).  Results:   Apalutamide + ADT treatment was efficacious in extending rPFS and OS versus placebo + ADT. Within a relatively narrow apalutamide exposure range (coefficient of variation: 22%), no statistical association was detected between rPFS, OS and apalutamide exposure quartiles. Incidence of skin rash and pruritus increased significantly with increasing apalutamide exposure.  Conclusions:   Differences in apalutamide exposure were not associated with clinically relevant differences in rPFS or OS in patients with mCSPC.

The accuracy of 99m Tc-sestamibi imaging diagnoses was assessed against histopathology.

Results:   A total of 74 patients with SRMs were investigated with 99m Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT.

Prolonged progression-free survival of prostate cancer patients is associated with high regucalcin expression in the tumor tissues. This study investigates the underlying mechanism by which regucalcin prevents bone metastatic activity of prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Human prostate cancer PC-3 or DU-145 wild-type cells or regucalcin-overexpressing PC-3 or DU-145 cells (transfectants) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum.  Results:   Overexpressed regucalcin suppressed the migration and invasion of bone metastatic human prostate cancer cells in vitro, and it reduced the levels of key proteins in metastasis including Ras, Akt, MAPK, RSK-2, mTOR, caveolin-1, and integrin β1. Invasion of prostate cancer cells was promoted by coculturing with preosteoblastic MC3T3-E1 or preosteoclastic RAW264.7 cells. Coculturing with cancer cells and bone cells repressed the growth of preosteoblastic cells and enhanced osteoclastogenesis of preosteoclastic cells, and these alterations were caused by a conditioned medium from cancer cell culture. Disordered differentiation of bone cells was prevented by regucalcin overexpression. Production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in cancer cells was blocked by overexpressed regucalcin. Of note, the effects of conditioned medium on bone cells were prevented by NF-κB inhibitor. TNF-α may be important as a mediator in the crosstalk between cancer cells and bone cells.

Sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitation using an anti-AR antibody (AR-ChIP seq) revealed distinct profiles of AR binding site (ARBS) in androgen-dependent and castration-resistant xenograft tumors compared with those previously reported based on human PCa cells or tumor tissues. An integrative genetic analysis identified several AR-target genes associated with CRPC progression including OPRK1, which harbors ARBS and was upregulated upon androgen deprivation. Loss of function of OPRK1 retarded the acquisition of castration resistance and inhibited castration-resistant growth of PCa both in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that expression of OPRK1, a G protein-coupled receptor, was upregulated in human prostate cancer tissues after preoperative androgen derivation or CRPC progression.

Protein signatures for suppression of tumor immunity and chemotaxis are elevated in men of West African ancestry. Importantly, the suppression of tumor immunity protein signature associates with metastatic and lethal prostate cancer, pointing to clinical importance. Moreover, two markers, pleiotrophin and TNFRSF9, predict poor disease survival specifically among African American men. These findings indicate that immune-oncology marker profiles differ between men of African and European descent. These differences may contribute to the disproportionate burden of lethal prostate cancer in men of African ancestry.

Methods:   IMPT technique was implemented in 23 patients with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer treated at West German Proton Therapy Centre from March 2016 till June 2018, using SIB technique prescribing 60 GyRBE and 72 GyRBE in 30 fractions to PTV1 (prostate and seminal vesicle) and PTV2 boost (prostate and proximal seminal vesicle), respectively. In 15 patients, a transperineal injection of hydrogel was applied prior to radiotherapy to increase the distance between prostate and rectum. Planning and all treatments were performed with a 120 ml fluid-filled endorectal balloon customised daily for each patient. For each patient, 2 lateral IMPT beams were implemented taking a field-specific range uncertainty (RU) into account. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were analyzed for PTV2, PTV2 with range uncertainty margin (PTV2RU), rectum, bladder, right/left femoral heads, and penile bulb. For late rectal toxicities, the normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) were calculated using different biological models. A DVH- and NTCP-based dosimetric comparison was carried out between non-spacer and spacer groups.  Results:   For the 23 patients, high-quality plans could be achieved for target volume and for other organs at risk (OARs). For PTV2, the V107% was 0% and the Dmax did not exceed 106.2% of the prescribed dose. The volume PTV2RU covered by 95% of the dose ranged from 96.16 to 99.95%. The conformality index for PTV2RU was 1.12 ± 0.057 and the homogeneity index (HI) was 1.04 ± 0.014. Rectum Dmax and rectal volume receiving 73-50 Gy could be further reduced for the spacer-group. Significant reductions in mean and median rectal NTCPs (stenosis/necrosis, late rectal bleeding ≥ 2, and late rectal toxicities ≥ 3) were predicted for the spacer group in comparison to the non-spacer group.

This study aims to analyze the impact of possible interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching for prostate cancer radiotherapy.  Methods:   Retrospective data, consisting of 156 CBCT images from twelve prostate cancer patients with elective nodal irradiation were analyzed in this study. To simulate possible interobserver variability, couch shifts of 2 mm relative to the resulting patient position of prostate alignment were assumed as potential patient positions (27 possibilities). For each CBCT, the doses of the potential patient positions were re-calculated using deformable image registration-based synthetic CT. The impact of the simulated interobserver variability was evaluated using tumor control probabilities (TCPs) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs).  Results:   No significant differences in TCPs were found between prostate alignment and potential patient positions (0.944 ± 0.003 vs 0.945 ± 0.003, P = 0.117). The average NTCPs of the rectum ranged from 5.16 to 7.29 (%) among the potential patient positions and were highly influenced by the couch shift in the anterior-posterior direction. In contrast, the average NTCPs of the bladder ranged from 0.75 to 1.12 (%) among the potential patient positions and were relatively negligible.  Conclusions:   The NTCPs of the rectum, rather than the TCPs of the target, were highly influenced by the interobserver variability in CBCT-based soft-tissue matching.

Growing evidence shows that patients with a limited number of metastases benefit from primary-directed radiotherapy (PDT) as well as from metastasis-directed radiotherapy (MDT). This survey investigates the current treatment practice for OMPC among German-speaking radiation oncologists.  Methods:   Members of the German Society for Radiation Oncology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Radioonkologie [DEGRO]) were surveyed regarding their current treatment practice via an anonymous online questionnaire sent by email. The survey included six general items and 14 specific items regarding treatment characteristics. Questionnaires with at least 50% of questions completed were considered for further analysis.  Results:   A total of 204 responses were received (15% response rate), 167 were considered for further analysis. Most respondents stated to be specialized in treating prostate cancer patients and to treat 10-30 patients with OMPC per annum; 97% considered PSMA-PET/CT necessary to define oligometastatic disease. Opinions differed regarding the use of systemic therapies: 63% of the respondents aimed to defer systemic therapy using radiotherapy in OMPC, whereas 37% considered systemic therapy necessary. In the setting of synchronous OMPC, 97% recommended PDT with or without a combination of MDT and/or systemic therapy. For metachronous nodal or bone oligometastatic recurrence, 98 and 99%, respectively, would opt for MDT. The majority would combine MDT with systemic therapy in patients with metachronous oligorecurrence. Respondents recommended normofractionation, hypofractionation, and SBRT for lymph node metastases in 49, 27, and 24%, respectively. No consensus existed regarding the field size for MDT of lymph node metastases. Most respondents preferred > 5 fractions for treatment of bone metastases.  Conclusion:   Local radiotherapy for PDT and MDT is routinely used among respondents of this survey, representing 12% of all German-speaking radiation oncologists. The timing of systemic therapy, fractionation schedules, and field sizes are handled differently and remain an area of active investigation.""","""['Paul Rogowski', 'Christian Trapp', 'Rieke von Bestenbostel', 'Dinah Konnerth', 'Sebastian Marschner', 'Nina-Sophie Schmidt Hegemann', 'Claus Belka', 'Minglun Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Strahlenther Onkol""","""['Radiotherapy of oligometastatic prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Treatment outcomes of metastasis-directed treatment using 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT for oligometastatic or oligorecurrent prostate cancer: Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology group study (TROD 09-002).', 'Non-palliative radiotherapy in ab initio oligometastatic prostate cancer: an Italian national survey.', 'Novel Insights into the Management of Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Addition of Metastasis-Directed Therapy to Intermittent Hormone Therapy for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: The EXTEND Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.']"""

Here we investigated the anti-cancer effects of 3-BP on prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Cell growth, apoptosis, migration, motility, and invasion were examined. The tumor growth ability was determined using a xenograft murine model. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq was performed to explore the mechanism of action of 3-BP. Our experimental results showed that 3-BP effectively inhibits prostate cancer cell growth, especially in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. Moreover, 3-BP induces apoptosis and suppresses cell migration, motility, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and invasion in CRPC cells. In addition, 3-BP also attenuates tumor growth in a xenograft murine model. Through transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq, 3-BP significantly regulates the cell cycle pathway and decreases the expression of downstream cycle cycle-associated genes in CRPC cells. The results of cell cycle analysis indicated that 3-BP arrests cell cycle progression at G2/M in CRPC cells.

Ferroptosis, a form of iron-dependent programmed cell death, has recently been found to be involved in matrix-detached cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ECM-detached cells escape ferroptosis are not fully understood. Here, we observed that cell migration-inducing protein (CEMIP) upregulation facilitates ferroptosis resistance during ECM detachment by promoting cystine uptake in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Meanwhile, silencing CEMIP causes it to lose its ability to promote cystine uptake and inhibit ferroptosis. Mechanistically, the interaction of CEMIP with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3) modulates calcium ion (Ca2+ ) leakage from the endoplasmic reticulum, activating calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), which further facilitates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) phosphorylation and nuclear localization, leading to elevated transcription of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), a glutamate/cystine antiporter, in PCa cells.

We describe the prevalence of P/LPs in BRCA1/2 and PALB2 (B1B2P2) across malignancies and the frequency of clinical germline testing (CGT) in patients with P/LPs in B1B2P2 identified on tumor-only testing.  Experimental design:   Among 7,575 patients with cancer tested between 2016 and 2018 with the OncoPanel tumor-only sequencing assay, we characterized P/LP frequencies by tumor type, receipt of CGT prior to or within 12 months after OncoPanel, and factors associated with CGT.  Results:   272 (3.6%) patients had OncoPanel-detected P/LPs in B1B2P2: 37.5% of P/LPs were in BRCA-related cancers; the remainder were in non-BRCA tumors. P/LPs were detected in ≥5% of breast, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, nonmelanoma skin, endometrial, small cell lung, and colorectal cancers. 37.9% of patients with P/LPs received CGT prior to OncoPanel; an additional 10.7% underwent CGT within 12 months of OncoPanel. Among 132 with CGT, 88.6% had ≥1 clinical factor for CGT compared with 47.1% who did not undergo CGT. Patients with BRCA tumors were more likely to have CGT compared with those without (81.4% vs. 29.0%, P < 0.0001). Among patients with CGT, 70.5% (93/132) of P/LPs were germline.  Conclusions:   Tumor-only genomic testing identified P/LPs in B1B2P2 in 3.6% of patients. 52.9% of patients with tumor-detected P/LPs and without CGT did not meet personal or family history criteria for CGT.

Objective:   To assess dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) screening rates and their association with fracture rates among older men with prostate cancer initiating treatment with androgen deprivation therapy.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective nationwide population-based cohort study used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and the Texas Cancer Registry linked with Medicare claims. Participants comprised 54 953 men 66 years or older with prostate cancer diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2015 who initiated treatment with ADT. Data were censored at last enrollment in Medicare and analyzed from January 1 to September 30, 2021.  Exposures:   Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry screening within 12 months before and 6 months after the first ADT claim.  Main outcomes and measures:   Frequencies of DXA screening and fracture (any fracture and major osteoporotic fracture) and overall survival were calculated. The association between DXA screening and fracture was evaluated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model with propensity score adjustment.  Results:   Among 54 953 men (median age, 74 years; range, 66-99 years) with prostate cancer, 4689 (8.5%) were Hispanic, 6075 (11.1%) were non-Hispanic Black, 41 453 (75.4%) were non-Hispanic White, and 2736 (5.0%) were of other races and/or ethnicities (including 121 [0.2%] who were American Indian or Alaska Native; 1347 [2.5%] who were Asian, Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander; and 1268 [2.3%] who were of unknown race/ethnicity). Only 4362 men (7.9%) received DXA screening. The DXA screening rate increased from 6.8% in 2005 to 8.4% in 2015. Lower screening rates were associated with being single (odds ratio [OR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97; P = .01) and non-Hispanic Black (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.91; P < .001), living in small urban areas (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.90; P = .001) and areas with lower educational levels (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.83; P < .001), and receiving nonsteroidal androgens (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.39-0.84; P = .004). Overall, 9365 patients (17.5%) developed fractures after initial receipt of ADT. The median time to first fracture was 31 months (IQR, 15-56 months). In the multivariable model with propensity score adjustment, DXA screening was not associated with fracture risk at any site (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% CI, 0.89-1.04; P = .32) among men without previous fractures before receipt of ADT. However, previous DXA screening was associated with a decreased risk of major fractures (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83-1.00; P = .05) after propensity score adjustment.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, low DXA screening rates were observed among older men with localized or regional prostate cancer after initiation of treatment with ADT. Despite low rates of screening, evaluation of bone mineral density with a DXA scan was associated with lower risk of major fractures. These findings suggest that DXA screening is important for the prevention of major fractures among older men with prostate cancer and that implementation strategies are needed to adopt bone health screening guidelines in clinical practice.""","""['Maria E Suarez-Almazor', 'Xerxes Pundole', 'Gerardo Cabanillas', 'Xiudong Lei', 'Hui Zhao', 'Linda S Elting', 'Maria A Lopez-Olivo', 'Sharon H Giordano']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Dual X-ray Absorptiometry Screening for Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy-Hiding in Plain (Film) Sight.', 'Low rates of bone mineral density measurement in Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer initiating androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Bone density testing among prostate cancer survivors treated with androgen-deprivation therapy.', 'Utilization of DXA Bone Mineral Densitometry in Ontario: An Evidence-Based Analysis.', 'Osteoporosis in men with prostate carcinoma receiving androgen-deprivation therapy: recommendations for diagnosis and therapies.', 'Bone and metabolic health in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Many studies have indicated that CCAN is related to the tumorigenesis and cancer development. Nonetheless, the overview of CCAN gene family in pan-cancer remain incompletely understood.  Methods:   We performed a comprehensive investigation on pan-cancer impacts of CCAN by integrating multi-omics data. We comprehensively investigated the expression profile, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathway, mutation, copy number variation, tumor microenvironment, immune cells infiltration, and drug sensitivity of CCAN in pan-cancer. MRNA expression profiles were collected from the cancer genome atlas, oncomine and ccle, the differential expression and various relevance analysis were performed with R or Perl.  Results:   The results showed that the expression of CCAN was different in 33 tumors. Intriguingly, the poor survival in adrenocortical carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, kidney chromophobe, mesothelioma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, brain lower grade glioma, pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, prostate adenocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, uveal melanoma was most likely related to the kegg single transduction pathway including one carbon pool by folate, proteasome, arachidonic acid metabolism and so on. CENPC, ITGB3BP, APITD1, CENPU, and CENPW were more involved in tumor microenvironment, which more likely related to NK cells resting, T cells follicular helper, T cells CD8, neutrophils, macrophages M0, T cells CD4 memory activated. The relationship of CCAN expression with drug sensitivity showed that chelerythrine, nelarabine, and hydroxyurea maybe be potential drugs.

Our group previously demonstrated that the total length of Gleason pattern (GP) 4 is a better predictor than %GP4 for adverse pathological outcomes at radical prostatectomy. We aimed to determine the association of GP4 length on prostate biopsy with post-prostatectomy oncologic outcomes.  Materials and methods:   We compared 4 GP4 quantification methods-including maximum %GP4 in any single core, overall %GP4, total length GP4 (mm) across all cores and length GP4 (mm) in the highest volume core-for prediction of biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   A total of 457 men with grade group 2 prostate cancer on biopsy subsequently underwent radical prostatectomy. The 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival probability was 85% (95% CI 81-88). On multivariable analysis, all 4 GP4 quantification methods were associated with biochemical recurrence-maximum %GP4 (HR=1.30; 95% CI 1.07-1.59; p=0.009), overall %GP4 (HR=1.61; 95% CI 1.21-2.15; p=0.001), total length GP4 (HR=2.48; 95% CI 1.36-4.52; p=0.003) and length GP4 in highest core (HR=1.32; 95% CI 1.11-1.57; p=0.001). However, we were unable to identify differences between methods of quantification with a relatively low event rate.  Conclusions:   These findings support further studies on GP4 quantification in addition to the ratio of GP3 and GP4 to classify prostate cancer risk.

However, it is unclear whether the routine practice of prostate biopsy obscures the image finding of PSMA-PET/CT. This study aimed to compare the tumor positivity rate of PSMA-PET/CT performed pre- (PSMA-PET/CTpre) and post-biopsy (PSMA-PET/CTpost) in high-risk PCa patients.  Patients and methods:   We matched 58 PSMA-PET/CTpost with 58 PSMA-PET/CTpre studies for primary detection of high-risk PCa according to clinical characteristics. Three subgroups of PSMA-PET/CTpost were defined by the intervals after biopsy (≤ 1 week, 1 ~ 2 weeks, and 2 ~ 5 weeks). Tumor positivity rates were determined, and SUVmax of primary tumors were compared separately for the two main groups and the related subgroups. Malignant prostate tissues from 20 of these patients were examined by immunohistochemical analysis of PSMA. In addition, the values of PSMA-PET/CTpre and PSMA-PET/CTpost in assessing seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) were evaluated in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Results:   All the primary tumors were positive on PSMA-PET/CTpost and PSMA-PET/CTpre imaging, resulting in a patient-based positivity rates of 100% (58/58) in both groups. All examined IHC results (20/20) confirmed the high-level expression of PSMA. SUVmax of primary tumors did not differ between the two main groups (16.1, IQR 9.8-26.6 vs. 16.5, IQR 11.0-26.7, p > 0.05). Subgroup analysis of PSMA-PET/CTpost (≤ 1 week, 1 ~ 2 weeks, and 2 ~ 5 weeks) also showed no significant difference in tumor SUVmax (15.8, IQR 9.5-22.2; 17.8, IQR 9.8-29.2; and 15.4, IQR 10.1-30.3. p > 0.05). PSMA-PET/CTpost and PSMA-PET/CTpre exhibited similar value in SVI detection as well.  Conclusions:   The tumor positivity rate was consistently high for PSMA-PET/CT pre- and post-biopsy.

Methods:   Nine observers with varying NaF PET/CT experience, ranging from no experience to 2000+ examinations, evaluated 211 NaF PET/CT scans from PCa patients participating in one of four prospective trials. Each observer evaluated each NaF PET/CT on a patient level using a trichotomous scale: M0 (no bone metastases), Me (equivocal for bone metastases) and M1 (bone metastases). Subsequently, a dichotomous evaluation was conducted (M0/M1). The final diagnosis was retrieved from the original study. For each observer, ROC curves and the diagnostic accuracy were calculated based on dichotomous and trichotomous scales; in the latter case, Me was first regarded as M1 and then M0.  Results:   Across all experience levels, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy using the dichotomous scale ranged from 0.81 to 0.89, 0.93 to 1.00 and 0.91 to 0.94, respectively.

By the use of human specimens and cell models, we addressed the role of eIF4A1 in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. EIF4A1 expression, as determined by mRNA and protein levels, was higher in primary prostate cancers relative to normal prostate tissue. Also, for primary prostate cancers, elevated mRNA levels of EIF4A1 correlated with DNA hypomethylation levels in the CpG-rich island of EIF4A1. Using a DNMT3a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool for specific targeting of DNA methylation, we characterized, in human prostate cancer cells, the epigenetic regulation of EIF4A1 transcripts through DNA methylation in the CpG-rich island of EIF4A1. Next, we investigated the oncogenic effect of EIF4A1 on cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. For prostate cancer cells, EIF4A1 heterozygous knockout or knockdown inhibited protein translation and tumor growth. In addition, using RNA immunoprecipitation with RNA sequencing, we discovered the eIF4A1-mediated translational regulation of the oncogene BRD2, which contains the most enriched eIF4A1-binding motifs in its 5' untranslated region, establishing an eIF4A1-BRD2 axis for oncogenic translation. Finally, we found a positive correlation between expression levels of eIF4A1 and BRD2 in primary prostate cancers.

Methods:   A total of 248 male patients with mid-low rectal cancer were recruited in this study between February 2017 and July 2020. To overcome selection bias, we performed a 1:1 match using six variables, including age, BMI, ASA score, tumor distance, clinical T stage, and tumor size. The urinary function was assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), sexual function was assessed by a 5-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and ejaculation grading at postoperative 3 and 12 months.  Results:   79 patients received functional TME surgery (FTME group), and 169 patients received routine TME surgery (RTME group). After the propensity score, 79 pairs were balanced and analyzed.

Transurethral plasmakinetic resection of prostate (TUPKP) is one of the foremost surgical procedures for the treatment of BPH. It has become well established in clinical practice with good efficacy and safety. In 2018, we issued the guideline ""2018 Standard Edition"". However much new direct evidence has now emerged and this may change some of previous recommendations. The time is ripe to develop new evidence-based guidelines, so we formed a working group of clinical experts and methodologists. The steering group members posed 31 questions relevant to the management of TUPKP for BPH covering the following areas: questions relevant to the perioperative period (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) of TUPKP in the treatment of BPH, postoperative complications and the level of surgeons' surgical skill. We searched the literature for direct evidence on the management of TUPKP for BPH, and assessed its certainty generated recommendations using the grade criteria by the European Association of Urology. Recommendations were either strong or weak, or in the form of an ungraded consensus-based statement. Finally, we issued 36 statements. Among them, 23 carried strong recommendations, and 13 carried weak recommendations for the stated procedure. They covered questions relevant to the aforementioned three areas. The preoperative period for TUPKP in the treatment of BPH included indications and contraindications for TUPKP, precautions for preoperative preparation in patients with renal impairment and urinary tract infection due to urinary retention, and preoperative prophylactic use of antibiotics. Questions relevant to the intraoperative period incorporated surgical operation techniques and prevention and management of bladder explosion. The application to different populations incorporating the efficacy and safety of TUPKP in the treatment of normal volume (< 80 ml) and large-volume (≥ 80 ml) BPH compared with transurethral urethral resection prostate, transurethral plasmakinetic enucleation of prostate and open prostatectomy; the efficacy and safety of TUPKP in high-risk populations and among people taking anticoagulant (antithrombotic) drugs. Questions relevant to the postoperative period incorporated the time and speed of flushing, the time indwelling catheters are needed, principles of postoperative therapeutic use of antibiotics, follow-up time and follow-up content. Questions related to complications incorporated types of complications and their incidence, postoperative leukocyturia, the treatment measures for the perforation and extravasation of the capsule, transurethral resection syndrome, postoperative bleeding, urinary catheter blockage, bladder spasm, overactive bladder, urinary incontinence, urethral stricture, rectal injury during surgery, postoperative erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation. Final questions were related to surgeons' skills when performing TUPKP for the treatment of BPH. We hope these recommendations can help support healthcare workers caring for patients having TUPKP for the treatment of BPH.""","""['Xian-Tao Zeng#', 'Ying-Hui Jin#', 'Tong-Zu Liu#', 'Fang-Ming Chen', 'De-Gang Ding', 'Meng Fu', 'Xin-Quan Gu', 'Bang-Min Han', 'Xing Huang', 'Zhi Hou', 'Wan-Li Hu', 'Xin-Li Kang', 'Gong-Hui Li', 'Jian-Xing Li', 'Pei-Jun Li', 'Chao-Zhao Liang', 'Xiu-Heng Liu', 'Zhi-Yu Liu', 'Chun-Xiao Liu', 'Jiu-Min Liu', 'Guang-Heng Luo', 'Yi Luo', 'Wei-Jun Qin', 'Jian-Hong Qiu', 'Jian-Xin Qiu', 'Xue-Jun Shang', 'Ben-Kang Shi', 'Fa Sun', 'Guo-Xiang Tian', 'Ye Tian', 'Feng Wang', 'Feng Wang', 'Yin-Huai Wang', 'Yu-Jie Wang', 'Zhi-Ping Wang', 'Zhong Wang', 'Qiang Wei', 'Min-Hui Xiao', 'Wan-Hai Xu', 'Fa-Xian Yi', 'Chao-Yang Zhu', 'Qian-Yuan Zhuang', 'Li-Qun Zhou', 'Xiao-Feng Zou', 'Nian-Zeng Xing', 'Da-Lin He', 'Xing-Huan Wang;Chinese Urological Doctor Association (CUDA);Urological Association of Chinese Research Hospital Association (CRHA-UA);Uro-Health Promotive Association of China International Exchange and Promotive Association for Medical and Health Care (CPAM-UHPA)']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mil Med Res""","""['A comparative study of thulium laser resection of the prostate and bipolar transurethral plasmakinetic prostatectomy for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Safety and effect of transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate versus bipolar transurethral plasmakinetic prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia: A meta-analysis.', 'Efficacy and Safety Evaluation of Transurethral Resection of the Prostate versus Plasmakinetic Enucleation of the Prostate in the Treatment of Massive Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Transurethral resection of the prostate stricture management.', 'Surgical Complications in the Management of Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia Treatment.', 'Clinical efficacy and complications of transurethral resection of the prostate versus plasmakinetic enucleation of the prostate.', 'Effect of Pudendal Nerve Block on the Prevention of Postoperative Bladder Spasm and Catheter-Related Bladder Discomfort in Male Patients Undergoing Transurethral Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.', 'FruHis significantly increases the anti-benign prostatic hyperplasia effect of lycopene: A double-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial.', 'Circadian rhythm in prostate cancer: time to take notice of the clock.']"""

They were divided into two groups, prostatitis group (n = 42) and prostate cancer (PCa) group (n = 50), according to pathological results. Parameters, like patient characteristics, PSADR, DPC, TSRP and infectious indicators, were compared and analyzed by t test or non-parametric test to identify if there were significant differences. The thresholds of parameters were determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and the data were analyzed to investigate the diagnostic value in distinguishing of prostatitis and prostate cancer.  Results:   There were statistical differences in age, PSADR, DPC, TSRP, neutrophil percentage in serum, white blood cell (WBC) in urine and prostate volume between prostatitis group and PCa group (P < 0.001, < 0.001, = 0.001, 0.001, 0.024, 0.014, < 0.001 respectively). There was no statistical difference in serum WBC count, serum neutrophil count, monocyte percentage and urine bacterial count between two groups (P = 0.089, 0.087, 0.248, 0.119, respectively). Determined by ROC curve, when the thresholds of PSADR per week as 3.175 ng/mL/week, DPC as 1.113, TSRP as 2.708 were cutoffs of distinguishing prostatitis and prostate cancer. When combining these three indexes to diagnose, the accuracy rate of diagnosis of prostatitis was 78.85%, the accuracy rate of diagnosis of prostate cancer was 97.50%. Univariate analysis suggested that PSADR, DPC and TSRP played an important role in differentiating prostate cancer from prostatitis (P < 0.05), multivariate analysis suggested PSADR > 3.175 might be good indicators when distinguishing prostate disease with prostatitis (OR = 14.305, 95%CI = 3.779 ~ 54.147), while DPC > 1.113 and TSRP > 2.708 might be associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer (OR = 0.151, 95%CI = 0.039 ~ 0.588; OR = 0.012, 95%CI = 0.005 ~ 0.524, respectively).

A retrospective monocentric analysis""","""Background:   Radium 223 (Ra-223) was approved for the treatment of metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with bone-only disease, following demonstration of significant improvement in overall survival (OS). To date, there are no validated prognostic factors useful in predicting outcome of mCRPC patients treated with Ra-223. Our retrospective study aims to evaluate the prognostic role of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events in mCRPC patients treated with Ra-223, and to identify which factors correlate with the toxicity onset.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of all consecutive mCRPC patients treated with Ra-223 from September 2013 to December 2019 at our institute. Patients were divided in 2 groups according to the reason of Ra-223 therapy discontinuation: toxicity versus other causes. Outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS) and OS.  Results:   In the overall population (75 patients) median PFS and OS were 5.46 months and 11.15 months respectively. Patients who discontinued treatment due to toxicity had a lower median PFS (3.49 vs 5.89 months, HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.14-3.12, p = 0.014) and OS (8.59 vs 14.7 months HR: 3.33, 95% CI: 1.85-6.01, p < 0.001) than patients who discontinued therapy due to other causes. The risk of Ra-223 discontinuation due to toxicity correlates with the number of previous treatments (p = 0.002), previous chemotherapy treatment (p = 0.039), baseline LDH (p = 0.012), Hb (p = 0.021) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.024).  Conclusions:   Discontinuation due to toxicity is associated with worse outcomes in mCRPC patients treated with Ra-223. To reduce the risk of developing toxicities that may compromise treatment efficacy, Ra-223 should be used early in mCRPC patients.""","""['Fabio Turco', 'Marcello Tucci', 'Tiziana Angusti', 'Antonella Parente', 'Rosario Francesco Di Stefano', 'Susanna Urban', 'Chiara Pisano', 'Alessandro Samuelly', 'Alessandro Audisio', 'Marco Audisio', 'Elena Parlagreco', 'Antonio Ungaro', 'Giorgio Vittorio Scagliotti', 'Massimo Di Maio', 'Consuelo Buttigliero']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Tumori""","""['The impact of genetic aberrations on response to radium-223 treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases.', 'Clinical indicators for predicting prognosis after radium-223 administration in castration-resistant prostate cancer with bone metastases.', 'Clinical outcomes, management, and treatment patterns in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with radium-223 in community compared to academic settings.', 'Treatment outcomes with radium-223 in docetaxel-naïve versus docetaxel-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: Real-world evidence from Taiwan.', 'Optimal usage of radium-223 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Clinical significance of completion of radium-223 treatment and acute adverse events in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Histology-Agnostic Drugs in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Thus, it is important to screen out potential key biomarkers for the pathogenesis and prognosis of PCa. The present study aimed to identify potential biomarkers to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PCa tissues and matched normal tissues from The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) dataset were screened out by R software. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed primarily to identify statistically significant genes for clinical manifestations. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and network screening were performed based on the STRING database in conjunction with Cytoscape software. Hub genes were then screened out by Cytoscape in conjunction with stepwise algorithm and multivariate Cox regression analysis to construct a risk model. Gene expression in different clinical manifestations and survival analysis correlated with the expression of hub genes were performed. Moreover, the protein expression of hub genes was validated by the Human Protein Atlas database. Results: A total of 1,621 DEGs (870 downregulated genes and 751 upregulated genes) were identified from the TCGA-PRAD dataset. Eight prognostic genes [BUB1, KIF2C, CCNA2, CDC20, CCNB2, PBK, RRM2, and CDC45] and four hub genes (BUB1, KIF2C, CDC20, and PBK) potentially correlated with the pathogenesis of PCa were identified. A prognostic model with good predictive power for survival was constructed and was validated by the dataset in GSE21032. The survival analysis demonstrated that the expression of RRM2 was statistically significant to the prognosis of PCa, indicating that RRM2 may potentially play an important role in the PCa progression. Conclusion: The present study implied that RRM2 was associated with prognosis and could be used as a potential therapeutic target for PCa clinical treatment.""","""['Kun Liu', 'Yijun Chen', 'Pengmian Feng', 'Yucheng Wang', 'Mengdi Sun', 'Tao Song', 'Jun Tan', 'Chunyang Li', 'Songpo Liu', 'Qinghong Kong', 'Jidong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of Potential Key Genes for Pathogenesis and Prognosis in Prostate Cancer by Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression Profiles and the Cancer Genome Atlas.', 'Bioinformatics analysis identified hub genes in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis.', 'Screening of Key Prognosis Genes of Lung Adenocarcinoma Based on Expression Analysis on TCGA Database.', 'Identification of Multiple Hub Genes and Pathways in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Identification of potential biomarkers in cancer testis antigens for glioblastoma.', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals Influence Hub Genes Associated with Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

Although clinical treatments of PCa have made great progress in recent decades, once tolerance to treatments occurs, the disease progresses rapidly after recurrence. PCa exhibits a unique metabolic rewriting that changes from initial neoplasia to advanced neoplasia. However, systematic and comprehensive studies on the relationship of changes in the metabolic landscape of PCa with tumor recurrence and treatment response are lacking. We aimed to construct a metabolism-related gene landscape that predicts PCa recurrence and treatment response.  Methods:   In the present study, we used differentially expressed gene analysis, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to construct and verify a metabolism-related risk model (MRM) to predict the disease-free survival (DFS) and response to treatment for PCa patients.  Results:   The MRM predicted patient survival more accurately than the current clinical prognostic indicators. By using two independent PCa datasets (International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) PCa and Taylor) and actual patients to test the model, we also confirmed that the metabolism-related risk score (MRS) was strongly related to PCa progression. Notably, patients in different MRS subgroups had significant differences in metabolic activity, mutant landscape, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity. Patients in the high-MRS group were more sensitive to immunotherapy and endocrine therapy, while patients in the low-MRS group were more sensitive to chemotherapy.  Conclusions:   We developed an MRM, which might act as a clinical feature to more accurately assess prognosis and guide the selection of appropriate treatment for PCa patients.

According to surgical technique, incidence of post-prostatectomy incontinence varies from open (7-39.5%), laparoscopic (5-33.3%) or robotic-assisted (4-31%) approaches. The ProACT® device (Uromedica, Inc., MN) is a possible surgical option for the treatment of this condition.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed surgical records of consecutive patients underwent ProACT® implantation in our department between January 2006 to November 2010.

The targeted diagnoses are carcinomas of the breast (via mastectomy or breast conserving surgery), colon and rectum, prostate, and urinary bladder (via cystectomy or transurethral resection), exocrine pancreatic carcinoma as well as metastases of colorectal cancer to the liver. The choice was based on the high incidence of these cancers and/or frequent fatal outcome. We also collect age-matched normal controls. Our still ongoing collection originates from five clinical centers and after nearly 2-year cooperation reached 1711 patients and controls, yielding a total of 23226 independent samples, with an average of 74 donors and 1010 samples collected per month. The predominant diagnosis is breast carcinoma, with 933 donors, followed by colorectal carcinoma (383 donors), prostate carcinoma (221 donors), bladder carcinoma (81 donors), exocrine pancreatic carcinoma (15 donors) and metachronous colorectal cancer metastases to liver (14 donors). Forty percent of the total sample count originates from macroscopically healthy cancer-neighboring tissue, while contribution from tumors is 12%, which adds to the uniqueness of our collection for cancer predisposition studies. Moreover, we developed two program packages, enabling registration of patients, clinical data and samples at the participating hospitals as well as the central system of sample/data management at coordinating center. The approach used by us may serve as a model for dispersed biobanking from multiple satellite hospitals.

Noncoding events in regulatory promoter and enhancer regions frequently involved cancer-relevant genes such as BCL6, FGFR2, RAD51B, SMC6, TERT, and XBP1 and represent possible drivers. Unlike most noncoding regulatory events, XBP1 mutations primarily accumulated outside the gene's promoter, and we validated their effect on gene expression using CRISPR-interference screening and luciferase reporter assays.

However, this has not been evaluated for prostate biopsy and prostate cancer (PC) diagnosis in an equal-access health care system.  Objective:   To determine the association of the pandemic with prostate biopsy and PC diagnosis rates among Black vs White patients in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VAHCS).  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study included a retrospective analysis of all prostate biopsies performed on patients in the VAHCS without a preexisting PC diagnosis between January 2018 and March 2021. The base population included all living male patients who had at least 1 visit to the VAHCS during the 3 years prior to each month of the study.  Exposure:   The COVID-19 pandemic.  Main outcomes and measures:   The main outcomes were the number of prostate biopsies and PC diagnoses by month. The influence of the pandemic on prostate biopsy volume and the incidence of PC diagnoses was modeled using an interrupted time-series analysis. Poisson generalized linear models were fitted to project the expected number of prostate biopsies and PC diagnoses had there been no pandemic interruption. Additional models were used to test for differences by race.  Results:   Prior to the pandemic (January 2018 through February 2020), monthly biopsy numbers among 51 606 included men ranged between 1230 and 1695, of which 56% to 60% of results were positive for PC. The estimated number of missed PC diagnoses from March 2020 through March 2021 ranged from 97 cases (October 2020: 752 cases expected, 655 cases observed) to 573 cases (April 2020: 794 cases expected, 221 cases observed). Prior to the pandemic, biopsy rates were statistically significantly higher among Black vs White men (incidence rate ratio, 2.25; 95% CI, 2.06-2.46; P < .001). There was no change in biopsy rates associated with race at the onset of the pandemic nor during the recovery period from March 2020 to March 2021. Similar trends were observed for PC diagnosis rates.  Conclusions and relevance:   Results of this cohort study demonstrate that during the COVID-19 pandemic, prostate biopsy and PC diagnosis rates decreased, particularly during the peak of the pandemic.

Methods:   We conducted a 4-arm pilot randomized trial to assess feasibility and acceptability of a 3-month web-based diet and exercise intervention, among men (>18 years of age) with PC (reported elsewhere). The purpose of this study is to describe the change in QoL measured by surveys (eg, QLQ-C30, PROMIS Fatigue) at enrollment and following the intervention. Men were randomized 1:1:1:1 to increasing levels of web-based behavioral support: Level 1: website; Level 2: Level 1 plus personalized diet and exercise prescription; Level 3: Levels 1-2 plus Fitbit and text messages; Level 4: Levels 1-3 plus 2 30-minute coaching calls. T-tests were used to compare pre-post change in mean QoL scores between each Level and Level 1.  Results:   Two hundred and two men consented and were randomized (n = 49, 51, 50, 52 for Levels 1-4, respectively). Men were predominantly white (93%), with a median age of 70 years (Intra-quartile Range [IQR]: 65,75) and 3 years (IQR: 1,9) post primary treatment for mostly localized disease (74% with T1-2). There were no meaningful changes in QoL, but there were notable trends. Level 3 participants had small improvements in QLQ-C30 Global Health (5.46; 95% CI: -0.02, 10.95) compared to Level 1. In contrast, Level 2 participants trended toward decreasing Global QoL (-2.31, 95% CI: -8.05, 3.42), which may reflect declines in function (eg, Cognitive: -6.94, 95% CI: -13.76, -0.13) and higher symptom burden (eg, Diarrhea: 4.63, 95% CI: -1.48, 10.74).

However, the 18F-DCFPyL characteristics of suspected prostate cancer (SPCa) have been even more rarely described. Herein, in this retrospective study, we describe the clinical impact of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT imaging in SPCa.  Subjects and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the data of 56 SPCa patients who had undergone 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT studies. These patients were done for primary diagnosis/staging. Positron emission tomography/CT images were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively (maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and maximum SUV normalized by lean body mass (SULmax)). Histopathologic diagnosis was taken as reference standard. The optimal cut-off of 18F-DCFPyL was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC).  Results:   All the patients were confirmed by histopathological examination via prostatectomy or prostate biopsy. Fluorine-18-DCFPyL PET/CT showed higher radiotracer uptake in prostate cancer than that in non-prostate cancer. When SUVmax 5.0 and SULmax 4.0 were cut-off points for determining prostate cancer, the sensitivity of 18F-DCFPyL was 90%, specificity was 100%, and accuracy was 91.2%. Furthermore, there were highly significant positive correlations between SUVmax, SULmax and serum PSA. On comparison of areas under the curve, no significant difference was seen between SUVmax and SULmax in the sensitivity and specificity of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT for PCa identification. However, delayed PET/CT did not improved accuracy in the term of uncertain PCa in the initial standard imaging.

Methods:   The prostate, rectum, and urethra were contoured on a single patient transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) dataset. Anonymized DICOM files were disseminated to 16 departments who created an HDR prostate BT treatment plan on the dataset with a prescription dose of 15 Gy in a single fraction. Departments were asked to follow their own local treatment planning guidelines. Source positioning errors were then simulated in the 16 treatment plans and the effect on dose-volume histogram (DVH) indices calculated. Change in DVH indices were used to determine appropriate in-vivo source tracking error thresholds. Plans were considered to require intervention if the following DVH conditions occurred: prostate V100% < 90%, urethra D0.1cc > 118%, and rectumtt Dmax > 80%.  Results:   There was wide variation in appropriate in-vivo source tracking error thresholds among the 16 participating departments, ranging from 1 to 6 mm. Appropriate in-vivo source tracking error thresholds were also found to depend on the direction of the source positioning error and the endpoint.

Next, we aimed to determine a PSA threshold below which most patients had local and/or oligometastatic recurrence on PSMA-PET.  Methods:   One hundred and ten consecutive patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy (RP) ± radiation were referred for 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT. We correlated the location and number of PSMA-positive lesions against the treatment choice after imaging. Detection rates were stratified by PSA levels at the time of PET/CT. The study design was monocentric retrospective.  Results:   Thirty-four patients (30.9%) had a PSMA-negative scan, while 17 (15.5%) had local recurrence and 59 (53.6%) had metastatic recurrence on PSMA-PET. ROC analysis revealed a cut-off of ≤3 metastatic lesions on PSMA-PET for the steering of treatment decisions towards MDT rather than solely systemic therapy (AUC: 0.88). Defined as 3 or fewer metastatic lesions, oligometastatic recurrent PCa was found in up to 30% (33/110) of all patients. At PSA levels below 3.5 ng/ml, the rate of PSMA-positive disease that was locally confined or oligometastatic was 76% (45/59), dropping significantly to 29.4% (5/17) above this threshold (p<0.001) as polymetastatic findings became more frequent.  Conclusion:   The detection of ≤3 oligometastases on PSMA-PET encouraged the consecutive pursuit of MDT instead of systemic therapy alone. PSMA-PET predominantly captured patients at recurrence stages amenable to localized treatment when initiated at PSA levels below 3.5 ng/ml.""","""['Peter J Müller', 'Markus Dietlein', 'Carsten Kobe', 'Axel Heidenreich', 'Alexander Drzezga']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nuklearmedizin""","""['A Multicenter Prospective Clinical Trial of 68Gallium PSMA HBED-CC PET-CT Restaging in Biochemically Relapsed Prostate Carcinoma: Oligometastatic Rate and Distribution Compared With Standard Imaging.', 'Vesico-urethral anastomosis sampling: a forgotten tool for guiding salvage radiation after radical prostatectomy.', '18F-fluciclovine PET-CT and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET-CT in patients with early biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy: a prospective, single-centre, single-arm, comparative imaging trial.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Focal therapy for primary tumor and metastases in de novo or recurrent oligometastatic prostate cancer: current standing and future perspectives.', 'Radiotherapy in Oligometastatic, Oligorecurrent and Oligoprogressive Prostate Cancer: A Mini-Review.', 'The Value of Multimodality PET/CT Imaging in Detecting Prostate Cancer Biochemical Recurrence.']"""

The aim of this work is to investigate the anti-tumor effect of Fraxetin in prostate cancer and the potential mechanisms. In this study, the prostatic epithelial cell RWPE-1 and prostate cancer cell DU145 were exposed to Fraxetin (10, 20, 40, and 80 μM) to detect the changes in cell viability using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay.

Western blot assay was employed to detect the expression of proteins that participate in the above cellular processes as well as Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In addition to 40 μM Fraxetin treatment, DU145 cells were overexpressed with PLK4, and then the above experiments were repeated. Results revealed that Fraxetin markedly decreased DU145 cell viability, but didn't affect the cell viability of RWPE-1. Fraxetin suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced apoptosis of DU145 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the expression of PLK4 and phosphorylated PI3K and protein kinase B (Akt) were reduced upon Fraxetin treatment. Finally, PLK4 overexpression significantly reversed all the effects of Fraxetin on DU145 cells.

In our analysis we addressed factors that could indicate the likelihood of biochemical recurrence (BCR) early after radical prostatectomy. We mainly focused on the positive surgical margin (R1).  Methods:   Retrospective evaluation and analysis of the database of patients with prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy from 2001 to 2019. In total 1529 patients were enrolled in the study. The median follow-up was 48 months. The age of the patients ranged from 49 to 76 years. We used pre-operative PSA values, and the monitoring of the dynamics of 3rd generation PSA progression (detection limit 0.003 ng/ml) at month 1 and month 3 after surgery and then in 3-month intervals. We monitored the surgical margin positivity (R0 negative, R1 positive) and the Gleason score (GS) based on histological samples and we analysed the relationship to biochemical recurrence of the disease.  Results:   The pre-operative PSA value did not show a direct relationship to the R1 risk. Patient values in the groups R1 and R0 differed only by 1.159 ng/ml (p=NS). The 3rd generation PSA value at month 1 after surgery was 50.82% higher in R1 patients (p&gt;0.001). 50% of patients with R1 (29.5% patients of the total) did develop BCR during the follow-up period, while in patients with R0 (70.5% patients of the total) this proportion was 30% (p&gt;0.001). Among those with GS 67, 47% developed BCR. The GS 810 group relapsed in 75% of the cases (p&gt;0.001).  Conclusion:   According to our analysis 33% of the patients reached the stage of biochemical recurrence.

Although illegal in the United States, some transgender women may receive silicone injections for breast and soft tissue augmentation, which can lead to devastating local complications, as well as silicone migration, pulmonary embolism, systemic reactions, and death. Smoking rates are higher among transgender and sexual minority populations, placing them at elevated risk of smoking-related diseases, including lung cancer. Some opportunistic infections may be more common in the TGD populations, attributable to higher rates of coexisting infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Radiologists should be aware that these patients may develop cancer of their natal organs (eg, breast, prostate), especially as some of these tissues are not completely removed during gender-affirming surgery, which may manifest with thoracic involvement by secondary neoplasia.

However, human GHR is not activated by mouse GH, so direct actions of GH on prostate cancer cells were not evaluated in this context. The present study addresses the species specificity of GH-GHR activity by investigating GH actions in prostate cancer cell lines derived from a mouse Pten-deletion model. In vitro cell growth was stimulated by GH and reduced by pegvisomant. These in vitro GH effects were mediated at least in part by the activation of JAK2 and STAT5. When Pten-mutant cells were grown as xenografts in mice, pegvisomant treatment dramatically reduced xenograft size, and this was accompanied by decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. RNA sequencing of xenografts identified 1765 genes upregulated and 953 genes downregulated in response to pegvisomant, including many genes previously implicated as cancer drivers. Further evaluation of a selected subset of these genes via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction determined that some genes exhibited similar regulation by pegvisomant in prostate cancer cells whether treatment was in vivo or in vitro, indicating direct regulation by GH via GHR activation in prostate cancer cells, whereas other genes responded to pegvisomant only in vivo, suggesting indirect regulation by pegvisomant effects on the host endocrine environment.

Our objective is to identify metastatic prostate cancer phenotypes and their prognostic impact on survival.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Database was queried. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used for validation. Patterns were split into: nonregional lymph node, bone only, and visceral (any brain/liver/lung). Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models, odds ratios were calculated, Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and a nomogram of the multivariate regression model was created.  Results:   The training set included 13,818 men; bone only was most common (n = 11,632, 84.2%), then nonregional lymph node (n = 1388, 10.0%), and any visceral (brain/liver/lung; n = 798, 5.8%). Risk of death was increased by metastases to a visceral organ versus nonregional lymph node (HR = 2.26; 95% CI [2.00, 2.56]), bone only metastases versus nonregional lymph node (HR = 1.57; 95% CI [1.43, 1.72]), T-stage 4 versus 1 (HR = 1.27; 95% CI [1.17, 1.36]), Grade Group 5 versus 1 (HR = 1.93; 95% CI [1.61, 2.31]), PSA > 20 ng/mL versus < 10 ng/mL (HR = 1.32; 95% CI [1.23, 1.42]), and age ≥ 80 versus < 50 (HR = 1.96; 95% CI [1.69, 2.29]). On internal validation, the model had C-indices 20.5%, 22.7%, and 14.6% higher than the current staging system for overall survival, 1-year, and 5-year survival, respectively.

Dysregulated mitochondrial function has been linked to the initiation and progression of diverse human cancers. Deciphering the novel molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial function may provide important insights for developing novel therapeutics for CRPC.  Methods:   We investigate the expression of the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type F polypeptide interacting protein alpha 4 (PPFIA4) using public datasets and tumor specimens from PCa cases by immunohistochemistry. Gain- and loss-of-function studies are performed in PCa cell lines and mouse models of subcutaneous xenograft to characterize the role of PPFIA4 in CRPC. Gene expression regulation is evaluated by a series of molecular and biochemical experiments in PCa cell lines. The therapeutic effects of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) inhibitor combined enzalutamide are assessed using in vitro functional assays and in vivo mouse models.  Results:   We show that the increase of PPFIA4 exacerbates aggressive phenotype resembling CRPC. A fraction of PPFIA4 localizes to mitochondria and interacts with MTHFD2, a key enzyme for one-carbon metabolism. Androgen deprivation increases the translocation of PPFIA4 into mitochondria and increases the interaction between PPFIA4 and MTHFD2, which result in the elevation of tyrosine phosphorylated MTHFD2. Consequently, the levels of NADPH synthesis increase, resulting in protection against androgen deprivation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as promotion of tumor growth. Clinically, PPFIA4 expression is significantly increased in CRPC tissues compared with localized PCa ones. Importantly, an MTHFD2 inhibitor, DS18561882, combined with enzalutamide can significantly inhibit CRPC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo.  Conclusion:   Overall, our findings reveal a PPFIA4-MTHFD2 complex in mitochondria that links androgen deprivation to mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction, which suggest a potential strategy to inhibit CRPC progression.""","""['Ru Zhao', 'Tingting Feng', 'Lin Gao', 'Feifei Sun', 'Qianqian Zhou', 'Xin Wang', 'Junmei Liu', 'Wenbo Zhang', 'Meng Wang', 'Xueting Xiong', 'Wenqiao Jia', 'Weiwen Chen', 'Lin Wang', 'Bo Han']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Targeting PHB1 to inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer progression in vitro and in vivo.', 'Melatonin inhibits lipid accumulation to repress prostate cancer progression by mediating the epigenetic modification of CES1.', 'Targeting KDM4B that coactivates c-Myc-regulated metabolism to suppress tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Androgen Deprivation Freezes Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Cells in a Reversible, Genetically Unstable Quasi-Apoptotic State, Bursting into Full Apoptosis upon Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibition.', 'Mitochondrial metabolism: a predictive biomarker of radiotherapy efficacy and toxicity.', 'Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Is Sensitive to CDC42-PAK7 Kinase Inhibition.', 'Clinicopathological Significances and Prognostic Value of PPFIA4 in Colorectal Cancer.', 'Development and Validation of a 6-Gene Hypoxia-Related Prognostic Signature For Cholangiocarcinoma.']"""

In this work, we propose a framework to register TTMB cores to advanced volumetric ultrasound data such as multi-parametric transrectal ultrasound (mpTRUS).  Methods:   The framework has mainly two steps. First, needle trajectories are calculated with respect to the needle guiding template-considering deflections in their paths. In standard TTMB, a sparsely sampled ultrasound volume is taken prior to the procedure which contains the template overlaid on top of it. The position of this template is detected automatically, and the cores are mapped following the calculated needle trajectories. Second, the TTMB volume is aligned to the mpTRUS volume by a two-step registration method. Using the same transformations from the registration step, the cores are registered from the TTMB volume to the mpTRUS volume.  Results:   TTMB and mpTRUS of 10 patients were available for this work. The target registration errors (TRE) of the volumes using landmarks picked by three research assistants (RA) and one radiation oncologist (RO) were on average 1.32 ± 0.7 mm and 1.03 ± 0.6 mm, respectively. Additionally, on average, our framework takes only 97 s to register the cores.  Conclusion:   Our proposed framework allows a quick way to find the spatial location of the cores with respect to volumetric ultrasound. Furthermore, knowing the correct location of the pathology will facilitate focal treatment and will aid in training imaging-based cancer classifiers.""","""['Tajwar Abrar Aleef', 'Qi Zeng', 'W James Morris', 'S Sara Mahdavi', 'Septimiu E Salcudean']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Cancer Location in Upgrading and Detection after Transperineal Template-Guided Mapping Biopsy for Patients in Active Surveillance and Negative Transrectal Ultrasonography-Guided Prostate Biopsy.', 'Transperineal Template-guided Mapping Biopsy Identifies Pathologic Differences Between Very-Low-risk and Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Clinical performance of transperineal template guided mapping biopsy for therapeutic decision making in low risk prostate cancer.', 'Beyond transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies: available techniques and approaches.', 'Contemporary role of systematic prostate biopsies: indications, techniques, and implications for patient care.', 'Robotically controlled three-dimensional micro-ultrasound for prostate biopsy guidance.']"""

Patients and methods:   The data of all patients who underwent follow-up treatment 1 to 8 weeks after rp in 2016 (n = 1392) were evaluated by quantitative measuring all day incontinence under a defined graduation and compared to the results of 2009 (n = 1750).  Results:   The basic data of the patients including age (p < 0.001), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (median 10.8/13.76 ng/ml in 2009/2016), cancer stage (p = 0.001) and Gleason score (p = 0.001) were significantly higher in 2016. Robot-assisted prostatectomy (RARP; 12% in 2009 to 45% in 2016) was performed much more often than radical retropubic prostatectomy. Laparoscopic and perineal prostatectomy were rarely performed. Significantly fewer patients achieved pad-free continence at discharge in 2016 (23%) vs. 33.9% in 2009; p ≤ 0.001. Within the same age group, there was a significant worsening of continence (p = 0.01). The results of maintaining continence did not significantly differ between patients with open retropubic prostatectomy and RARP (p = 0.078). The certification type of a clinic had no effect on continence preservation (p = 0.12).  Conclusion:   Incontinence rates after discharge from a rehabilitation clinic are high and have not improved over time or with new surgical techniques.

It is based on the production of reactive oxygen species by radiosensitizing nanoparticles activated by X-rays. Hence, it allows overcoming the depth-penetration limitations of conventional photodynamic therapy and, at the same time, reducing the dose needed to eradicate cancer in the frame of radiotherapy treatment. The direct production of singlet oxygen by octahedral molybdenum cluster complexes upon X-ray irradiation is a promising avenue in order to simplify the architecture of radiosensitizing systems. One such complex was utilized to prepare water-stable nanoparticles using the solvent displacement method. The nanoparticles displayed intense red luminescence in aqueous media, efficiently quenched by oxygen to produce singlet oxygen, resulting in a substantial photodynamic effect under blue light irradiation. A robust radiosensitizing effect of the nanoparticles was demonstrated in vitro against TRAMP-C2 murine prostatic carcinoma cells at typical therapeutic X-ray doses. Injection of a suspension of the nanoparticles to a mouse model revealed the absence of acute toxicity as evidenced by the invariance of key physiological parameters.

The continence and potency rates at 12 months were 88.3% and 56.4%, respectively. The BCR rate was 22.3%, and the median time to BCR was 10.5 (IQR 3.5-26.9) months. The 1- and 3-year BCR-free survival rates were 87.6% and 78.7%, respectively, and the 1- and 3-year CR-free survival rates were 97.5% and 90.8%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Most patients with clinically high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer treated with primary RARP remained BCR-free and CR-free during the 1- and 3-year follow-up, demonstrating the good functional outcomes with RARP. RARP was a safe and feasible minimally invasive surgical alternative to radiotherapy or hormonal therapy in select patients with high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. These results should be validated to assure the reproducibility of measurements in prospective randomized-controlled studies on primary RARP.""","""['Tae Young Shin', 'Yong Seong Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Correction to: Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in the treatment of patients with clinically high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer: single surgeons functional and oncologic outcomes.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Retrograde Release of the Neurovascular Bundle with Preservation of Dorsal Venous Complex During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Optimizing Functional Outcomes.', 'Technical Refinements in Superextended Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients at Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Best practices in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: recommendations of the Pasadena Consensus Panel.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus external beam radiotherapy with androgen deprivation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Complications of extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in high-risk prostate cancer: A single high-volume center experience.', 'Oncological and functional outcomes of high-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer patients after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'What Is New in the Management of High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer?', 'Adjuvant radiotherapy in patients with node-positive prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.']"""

Compared with traditional diagnostic methods, microRNAs (miRNAs) are novel biomarkers with higher accuracy.  Objective:   We aimed to identify combinatorial biomarkers of miRNAs to construct a classification model for the diagnosis of HCC.  Methods:   The mature miRNA expression profile data of six cancers (liver, lung, gastric, breast, prostate, and colon) were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database with accession number GSE36915, GSE29250, GSE99417, GSE41970, GSE64333 and GSE35982. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profile data of these six cancers were obtained from TCGA. Three R software packages, student's t-test, and a normalized foldchange method were utilized to identify HCC-specific differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs). Using all combinations of obtained HCC-specific DEMs as input features, we constructed a classification model by support vector machine searching for the optimal combination. Furthermore, target genes prediction was conducted on the miRWalk 2.0 website to obtain differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), and KEGG pathway enrichment was analyzed on the DAVID website.  Results:   The optimal combination consisted of four miRNAs (hsa-miR-130a-3p, hsa-miR-450b-5p, hsa-miR-136-5p, and hsa-miR-24-1-5p), of which the last one has not been currently reported to be relevant to HCC. The target genes of hsa-miR-24-1-5p (CDC7, ACACA, CTNNA1, and NF2) were involved in the cell cycle, AMPK signaling pathway, Hippo signaling pathway, and insulin signaling pathway, which affect the proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis of cancer cells. Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves of the four miRNAs were all higher than 0.85.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that the miRNAs combined biomarkers were reliable for the diagnosis of HCC.

Herein, a novel suspension microarray system based on dual color quantum dots (QDs) nanobead as fluorescence label was developed for simultaneous detection of prostate specific antigen (PSA) biomarkers. When both antigens are present in sera sample, free (f)-PSA antibody-conjugated green and complexed (c)-PSA antibody-conjugated red QDs nanobeads would be both specifically absorbed onto the surface of total PSA antibody-conjugated magnetic beads, leading to the formation of magnetic fluorescent hybrid that can be purified from the mixture by an external magnet prior to flow cytometry analysis.

However, few patients from Asia were enrolled. Our study (NCT02294461) aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of enzalutamide in this disease setting in patients in mainland China, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.  Methods:   In this double-blind, phase III study, patients with asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic metastatic prostate cancer and disease progression despite ADT were randomized to enzalutamide (160 mg/day) or placebo. The primary endpoint was time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, radiographic progression-free survival, time to first skeletal-related event (SRE), time to initiation of cytotoxic chemotherapy, PSA response ≥ 50%, best overall soft-tissue response, and safety. Pre-planned interim analysis was scheduled following approximately 175 PSA-progression events (67% of targeted total of 261 events). An additional 5-year landmark analysis of overall survival, time to antineoplastic therapy, and safety was performed.  Results:   The double-blind study period was stopped after interim analysis owing to the benefit of enzalutamide over placebo. Overall, 388 patients were randomized (enzalutamide, n = 198; placebo, n = 190). Baseline characteristics were balanced between treatment groups. Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression vs placebo (hazard ratio 0.38; 95% CI 0.27-0.52; P < 0.0001). Median time to PSA progression was 8.31 months with enzalutamide and 2.86 months with placebo. Secondary endpoints, including 5-year overall survival, were significantly improved with enzalutamide, except time to first SRE. Adverse-event incidence was similar between enzalutamide and placebo. Fatigue was the most common drug-related adverse event in both treatment groups.  Conclusion:   Enzalutamide significantly reduced risk of PSA progression, improved secondary efficacy endpoints, and was well tolerated in chemotherapy-naïve Asian patients with mCRPC with disease progression despite ADT.

Invadopodia formation has been observed in-vitro and in-vivo in numerous metastatic cell lines derived from multiple tumour types. However, prostate cancer cell lines have not been routinely reported to generate invadopodia and the few instances have always required external stimulation.  Methods:   In this study, the invasive potential of primary prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines, which have never been fully characterised before, was investigated both in-vitro invadopodia assays and in-vivo zebrafish dissemination assay. Subsequently, circulating tumour cells from prostate cancer patients were isolated and tested in the invadopodia assay.  Results:   Retention of E-cadherin and N-cadherin expression indicated a transitional state of EMT progression, consistent with the idea of partial EMT that has been frequently observed in aggressive prostate cancer. All cell lines tested were capable of spontaneous invadopodia formation and possess a significant degradative ability in-vitro under basal conditions. These cell lines were invasive in-vivo and produced visible metastasis in the zebrafish dissemination assay. Importantly we have proceeded to demonstrate that circulating tumour cells isolated from prostate cancer patients exhibit invadopodia-like structures and degrade matrix with visible puncta. This work supports a role for invadopodia activity as one of the mechanisms of dissemination employed by prostate cancer cells.

The aim of this study was to engineer 'click-on' fluorescence detectors that transform standard robotic instruments into molecular sensing devices that enable the surgeon to detect near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence in a white-light setting. This NIR-fluorescence detector setup was engineered to be press-fitted onto standard forceps instruments of the da Vinci robot. Following system characterization in a phantom setting (i.e., spectral properties, sensitivity and tissue signal attenuation), the performance with regard to different clinical indocyanine green (ICG) indications (e.g., angiography and lymphatic mapping) was determined via robotic surgery in pigs. To evaluate in-human applicability, the setup was also used for ICG-containing lymph node specimens from robotic prostate cancer surgery. The resulting Click-On device allowed for NIR ICG signal identification down to a concentration of 4.77 × 10-6 mg/ml. The fully assembled system could be introduced through the trocar and grasping, and movement abilities of the instrument were preserved. During surgery, the system allowed for the identification of blood vessels and assessment of vascularization (i.e., bowel, bladder and kidney), as well as localization of pelvic lymph nodes. During human specimen evaluation, it was able to distinguish sentinel from non-sentinel lymph nodes.

Patients and methods:   Patients were retrospectively included between January 2005 and July 2018 from a prospectively maintained database at a single academic institution. No patient underwent androgen deprivation therapy prior to HIFU. Primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). Secondary oncological endpoints included salvage treatment-free survival (STFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS).  Results:   A total of 97 patients met our inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. According to D'Amico classification, the numbers of patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease were 38 (39.2%), 52 (53.6%), and 7 (7.2%). A total of 21 (21.6%) patients received salvage treatment at a mean of 4.1 years (± 2.8) after HIFU. The 10-year OS, CSS and BRFS rates were 91.8%, 100% and 40.3% in the overall cohort, respectively. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors for biochemical recurrence were intermediate-risk group (RR = 2.065; 95% CI 1.008-4.230; p = 0.047) and PSA nadir > 0.5 ng/mL (RR = 4.963; 95% CI 2.251-10.947; p < 0.001).

Methods:   Al18F-PSMA-Q was prepared automatically. The binding affinity to PSMA was evaluated in vitro using the 22Rv1 (PSMA +) and PC-3 (PSMA -) cell lines. Pharmacokinetics evaluation, biodistribution study, Micro-PET imaging of Al18F-PSMA-Q in normal mice and tumor-bearing mice, and a comparison with 18F-DCFPyL were performed. PET/CT imaging was performed on 8 healthy volunteers and 20 newly diagnosed PCa patients at 1 h post-injection (p.i.). The biodistribution in human and preliminary diagnostic efficacy of Al18F-PSMA-Q were evaluated, and the radiation dosimetry was estimated using OLINDA/EXM 2.0 software.  Result:   Qualified Al18F-PSMA-Q was efficiently prepared with a non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) of 22.0-28.3%, a specific activity (SA) of > 50 GBq/μmol. The hydrophilicity was comparably high with a log P value of - 3.69 ± 0.39. Al18F-PSMA-Q was found to bind to PSMA specifically with a Ki value of 17.05 ± 1.14 nM. The distribution and elimination half-lives of Al18F-PSMA-Q were 3.93 min and 14.22 min, respectively, which were shorter than those of 18F-DCFPyL. Micro-PET imaging of Al18F-PSMA-Q can clearly differentiate 22Rv1 tumors from PC-3 tumors and background with a high SUVmax of 2.17 ± 0.42 and a tumor-to-muscle ratio of 84.37 ± 31.62, which were higher than those of 18F-DCFPyL (1.79 ± 0.39 and 13.25 ± 1.65). The uptake of Al18F-PSMA-Q in 22Rv1 cells and tumors can be substantially blocked by 2-PMPA. High level accumulation of Al18F-PSMA-Q was observed in organs physiologically expressing PSMA. Twenty-six tumor lesions were detected in 20 PCa patients, and the mean SUVmax values of primary tumors, lymph node metastasis, bone metastases, and tumor-muscle ratios were 19.71 ± 16.52, 5.11, 31.30 ± 29.85, and 44.77 ± 22.29, respectively. The mean SUVmax of tumors in patients with PSA > 10 ng/mL was significantly higher than that in patients with PSA ≤ 10 ng/mL (25.97 ± 18.64 vs. 10.33 ± 3.74). Meanwhile, the mean SUVmax of tumors in patients with a Gleason score ≥ 8 was significantly higher than that in patients with a Gleason score < 8 (31.85 ± 22.09 vs. 13.18 ± 11.58). The kidneys received the highest estimated dose of 0.098 ± 0.006 mGy/MBq, and the effective dose was calculated as 0.0128 ± 0.007 mGy/MBq.  Conclusion:   The novel qualified PSMA-targeted radiotracer Al18F-PSMA-Q was conveniently prepared with favorable yield and SA. The results of preclinical and pilot clinical studies exhibited a high specific uptake in PCa lesions and an excellent tumor-to-background ratio with a reasonable radiation exposure, which indicated the great potential of Al18F-PSMA-Q for PCa imaging.

This study aimed to investigate the molecular changes that occur in tumor cell hypoxia with special emphasis placed on the efficacy of chemotherapeutic and radiation-related effects. Four commercially available chemotherapeutic agents: cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and 5-fluorouracil, were tested for their cytotoxic activity on the cancer cell lines PC3 (prostate), HepG2 (liver), and MCF-7 (breast). Tumor cell lines under hypoxia were treated with both IC50 concentrations of the different chemotherapeutic agents and irradiated with 5 and 10 Gy using a 137Cs gamma source. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein levels were examined using an ELISA assay. Hypoxic cells showed a significant change in cell viability to all chemotherapeutic agents in comparison to normoxic controls. HepG2 cells were more resistant to the cytotoxic drug doxorubicin compared to other cancer cell lines. The flow cytometric analysis showed that hypoxic cells have lower levels of total apoptotic cell populations (early and late apoptosis) compared to normoxic cells suggesting decreased hypoxia-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. The highest reduction in HIF-1α level was observed in the MCF-7 cell line (95.5%) in response to the doxorubicin treatment combined with 10 Gy irradiation of cells. Chemoradiotherapy could result in minimal as well as a high reduction of HIF-1α based on cell type, type of chemotherapy, and amount of ionizing radiation.

Prediction of lethal prostate cancer is key to any stratified screening program to avoid excessive overdiagnosis. Herein, PRS for incident prostate cancer was evaluated in two population-based cohorts of unscreened middle-aged men linked to cancer and death registries: the Västerbotten Intervention Project (VIP) and the Malmö Diet and Cancer study (MDC). SNP genotypes were measured by genome-wide SNP genotyping by array followed by imputation or genotyping of selected SNPs using mass spectrometry. The ability of PRS to predict lethal prostate cancer was compared to PSA and a commercialized pre-specified model based on four kallikrein markers. The PRS was associated with incident prostate cancer, replicating previously reported relative risks, and was also associated with prostate cancer death. However, unlike PSA, the PRS did not show stronger association with lethal disease: the hazard ratio for prostate cancer incidence vs. prostate cancer metastasis and death was 1.69 vs. 1.65 in VIP and 1.25 vs. 1.25 in MDC. PSA was a much stronger predictor of prostate cancer metastasis or death with an area-under-the-curve of 0.78 versus 0.63 for the PRS. Importantly, addition of PRS to PSA did not contribute additional risk stratification for lethal prostate cancer. We have shown that a PRS that predicts prostate cancer incidence does not have utility above and beyond that of PSA measured at baseline when applied to the clinically relevant endpoint of prostate cancer death. These findings have implications for public health policies for delivery of prostate cancer screening. Focusing polygenic risk scores on clinically significant endpoints such as prostate cancer metastasis or death would likely improve clinical utility.""","""['Robert J Klein#', 'Emily Vertosick#', 'Dan Sjoberg', 'David Ulmert', 'Ann-Charlotte Rönn', 'Christel Häggström', 'Elin Thysell', 'Göran Hallmans', 'Anders Dahlin', 'Pär Stattin', 'Olle Melander', 'Andrew Vickers', 'Hans Lilja']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""NPJ Precis Oncol""","""['Addition of a Genetic Risk Score for Identification of Men with a Low Prostate-specific Antigen Level in Midlife at Risk of Developing Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Improving the Specificity of Screening for Lethal Prostate Cancer Using Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Kallikrein Markers: A Nested Case-Control Study.', 'Twenty-year Risk of Prostate Cancer Death by Midlife Prostate-specific Antigen and a Panel of Four Kallikrein Markers in a Large Population-based Cohort of Healthy Men.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Polygenic risk scores to stratify cancer screening should predict mortality not incidence.', 'Genetic risk assessment of lethal prostate cancer using polygenic risk score and hereditary cancer susceptibility genes.', 'A Polygenic Risk Score for Prostate Cancer Risk Prediction.', 'Addition of a Genetic Risk Score for Identification of Men with a Low Prostate-specific Antigen Level in Midlife at Risk of Developing Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'Realistic expectations are key to realising the benefits of polygenic scores.', 'Establishing a Prediction Model for the Efficacy of Platinum-Based Chemotherapy in NSCLC Based on a Two Cohorts GWAS Study.']"""

However, the technique has modest specificity and a high false-positive rate, especially in men with mpMRI scored as indeterminate (3/5) or likely (4/5) to have clinically significant cancer (csPCa) (Gleason ≥3+4). Advanced MRI techniques have emerged which seek to improve this characterisation and could predict biopsy results non-invasively. Before these techniques are translated clinically, robust histological and clinical validation is required.  Methods and analysis:   This study aims to clinically validate two advanced MRI techniques in a prospectively recruited cohort of men suspected of prostate cancer. Histological analysis of men undergoing biopsy or prostatectomy will be used for biological validation of biomarkers derived from Vascular and Extracellular Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumours and Luminal Water imaging. In particular, prostatectomy specimens will be processed using three-dimension printed patient-specific moulds to allow for accurate MRI and histology mapping. The index tests will be compared with the histological reference standard to derive false positive rate and true positive rate for men with mpMRI scores which are indeterminate (3/5) or likely (4/5) to have clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Histopathological validation from both biopsy and prostatectomy samples will provide the best ground truth in validating promising MRI techniques which could predict biopsy results and help avoid unnecessary biopsies in men suspected of prostate cancer.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of dynamic changes of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) levels as a predictor of clinical efficacy or therapeutic resistance of patients who do not show a sufficient initial PSA decline of ≥50% from baseline during early therapy with Enzalutamide.  Methods:   Forty-eight men with bmCRPC on Enzalutamide 07/2010-09/2019 with initially rising PSA were analyzed. We monitored PSA, LDH and ALP at week 0, 2, 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter and analyzed the correlation between ALP rising at 12 weeks with or without LDH-normalization and the association with survival. For this we used Kaplan Meier analysis and uni- and multivariate cox-regression models.  Results:   In Kaplan-Meier analysis, ALP rising at 12 weeks with or without LDH-normalization was associated with significantly worse median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3 months vs. 5 months (Log rank P = 0.02) and 3 months vs. 5 months (P = 0.01), respectively and overall survival (OS) with 8 months vs. 15 months (P = 0.02) and 8 months vs. 17 months (P < 0.01). In univariate analysis of PFS, ALP rising at 12 weeks alone, ALP rising at 12 weeks without LDH-normalization and application of Enzalutamide after chemotherapy showed a statistically significant association towards shorter PFS (hazard ratio (HR): 0.51, P = 0.04; HR: 0.48, P = 0.03; HR: 0.48, P = 0.03).

Here, we demonstrate glycolytic oscillations in HeLa cervical cancer cell spheroids. Experiments revealed that a small number of HeLa cells in spheroids exhibited heterogeneous oscillations with a higher frequency than those in monolayers. Model analyses and our previous experiments indicated that the higher frequencies of oscillations in spheroids were mostly due to the increase in glycolytic enzyme activity in the cells, and to the decrease in glucose concentration by diffusional transport of glucose from the surface to inside the spheroids, as well as the increase in cell density through spheroid formation. These results and our previous studies imply that more malignant cancer cells tend to exhibit glycolytic oscillations with higher frequencies than less malignant cells. Adjacent cells in spheroids oscillated within a 10% difference in frequency, but did not synchronize with each other. This suggests that weak cell-to-cell interactions might exist among HeLa cells connected with cadherins in the spheroid microenvironment; however, the interactions were not strong enough to induce synchronization of glycolytic oscillations.""","""['Takashi Amemiya', 'Kenichi Shibata', 'Junpei Takahashi', 'Masatoshi Watanabe', 'Satoshi Nakata', 'Kazuyuki Nakamura', 'Tomohiko Yamaguchi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""FEBS J""","""['Primordial oscillations in life: Direct observation of glycolytic oscillations in individual HeLa cervical cancer cells.', 'Modeling studies of heterogeneities in glycolytic oscillations in HeLa cervical cancer cells.', 'Glycolytic pyruvate regulates P-Glycoprotein expression in multicellular tumor spheroids via modulation of the intracellular redox state.', 'Synchronisation of glycolytic activity in yeast cells.', 'Autologous spheroid culture: a screening tool for human brain tumour invasion.', 'Breast cancers as ecosystems: a metabolic perspective.', 'Tumor Organoid and Spheroid Models for Cervical Cancer.', 'Dynamic fluctuations in a bacterial metabolic network.']"""

The morphological and molecular correlates of MMR deficiency have been extensively characterized in certain tumour types such as colorectal and endometrial adenocarcinoma. In contrast, the histological and molecular features of MMR-deficient prostate cancer remain incompletely described. In this study, we evaluated 19 MMR-deficient prostate cancers, including 11 cases without prior systemic treatment.  Methods and results:   All treatment-naive cases (11 of 11, 100%) were grade group 4-5 and had predominant cribriform and/or solid growth patterns. Solid components (any amount) and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were 7 cases each (7 of 11, 64%). In 68 MMR-proficient grade group 5 prostate cancers, predominant cribriform or solid growth patterns, solid components (any amount) and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes were seen at significantly lower frequencies (31 of 68, 46%; 9 of 68, 13% and 6 of 62, 9%, respectively; P < 0.001 for all comparisons). Molecular evaluation of 19 cases demonstrated that MMR-deficiency was secondary to functional loss of MSH2/MSH6 and MLH1/PMS2 in 15 (79%) and 4 cases (21%), respectively. Definite or probable germline mutations were present in 4 cases (4 of 19, 21%). TMPRSS2::ERG rearrangements were identified in 2 cases (2 of 19, 11%). Recurrent cancer-relevant somatic mutations included (but were not limited to) ATM, TP53, FOXA1, RB1, BRCA2 and PTEN.

Steep dose gradients and a large weight on each individual fraction emphasize the need for motion management. Real-time motion management techniques such as multileaf collimator (MLC) tracking or couch tracking typically adjust for translational motion while rotations remain uncompensated with unknown dosimetric impact.  Purpose:   The purpose of this study is to demonstrate and validate dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during radiotherapy experiments with and without MLC and couch tracking.  Methods:   Real-time dose reconstruction was performed using the in-house developed software DoseTracker. DoseTracker receives streamed target positions and accelerator parameters during treatment delivery and uses a pencil beam algorithm with water density assumption to reconstruct the dose in a moving target. DoseTracker's ability to reconstruct motion-induced dose errors in a dynamically rotating and translating target was investigated during three different scenarios: (1) no motion compensation and translational motion correction with (2) MLC tracking and (3) couch tracking. In each scenario, dose reconstruction was performed online and in real time during delivery of two dual-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy prostate plans with a prescribed fraction dose of 7 Gy to the prostate and simultaneous intraprostatic lesion boosts with doses of at least 8 Gy, but up to 10 Gy as long as the organs at risk dose constraints were fulfilled. The plans were delivered to a pelvis phantom that replicated three patient-measured motion traces using a rotational insert with 21 layers of EBT3 film spaced 2.5 mm apart. DoseTracker repeatedly calculated the actual motion-including dose increment and the planned static dose increment since the last calculation in 84 500 points in the film stack. The experiments were performed with a TrueBeam accelerator with MLC and couch tracking based on electromagnetic transponders embedded in the film stack. The motion-induced dose error was quantified as the difference between the final cumulative dose with motion and without motion using the 2D 2%/2 mm γ-failure rate and the difference in dose to 95% of the clinical target volume (CTV ΔD95% ) and the gross target volume (GTV ΔD95% ) as well as the difference in dose to 0.1 cm3 of the urethra, bladder, and rectum (ΔD0.1CC ). The motion-induced errors were compared between dose reconstructions and film measurements.  Results:   The dose was reconstructed in all calculation points at a mean frequency of 4.7 Hz. The root-mean-square difference between real-time reconstructed and film-measured motion-induced errors was 3.1%-points (γ-failure rate), 0.13 Gy (CTV ΔD95% ), 0.23 Gy (GTV ΔD95% ), 0.19 Gy (urethra ΔD0.1CC ), 0.09 Gy (bladder ΔD0.1CC ), and 0.07 Gy (rectum ΔD0.1CC ).  Conclusions:   In a series of phantom experiments, online real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction was performed for the first time. The calculated motion-induced errors agreed well with film measurements. The dose reconstruction provides a valuable tool for monitoring dose delivery and investigating the efficacy of advanced motion-compensation techniques in the presence of translational and rotational motion.""","""['Casper Gammelmark Muurholm', 'Thomas Ravkilde', 'Robin De Roover', 'Simon Skouboe', 'Rune Hansen', 'Wouter Crijns', 'Tom Depuydt', 'Per R Poulsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Six degrees of freedom dynamic motion-including dose reconstruction in a commercial treatment planning system.', 'Electromagnetic guided couch and multileaf collimator tracking on a TrueBeam accelerator.', 'Dosimetric impact of intrafraction prostate rotation and accuracy of gating, multi-leaf collimator tracking and couch tracking to manage rotation: An end-to-end validation using volumetric film measurements.', 'Potential benefits of dosimetric VMAT tracking verified with 3D film measurements.', 'A review of artificial intelligence applications for motion tracking in radiotherapy.', 'Accumulated Dose Deviation of Rotational and Residual Setup Errors on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Using MIM Treated by Helical Tomotherapy.', 'The dosimetric error due to uncorrected tumor rotation during real-time adaptive prostate stereotactic body radiation therapy.']"""

BRCA1- and BRCA2-associated Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer Syndrome (HBOC) increases the relative and absolute risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer and, to a lesser extent, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Men face BRCA-related cancer risks as women do, although with a different magnitude, and they may also transmit the mutations to their children. Notwithstanding, men are under-tested compared to women and the communication is not tailored on their needs. The present RCT applies principles of the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA) in testing the psychological determinants of the men's adherence to evidence based guidelines on BRCA1/2 germline genetic and testing the efficacy of two messages.  Methods:   A total of 264 participants will be involved, among the men's relatives of women with verified germline mutations. The study entails a pre- post- evaluation with randomization of the participants in two conditions corresponding to the two messages.  Discussion:   The expected results provide answers related to the impact of action self-efficacy, outcome expectancy (personal or familiar), risk perception, health risk aversion, intolerance of uncertainty, perceived barriers, and coping self-efficacy on informed decision-making.

Methods:   We assembled two new-user, active-comparator cohorts using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (2007 to 2019). The first cohort included 5,063 initiators of GLP-1 receptor agonists and 112,955 of sulfonylureas. The second cohort included 53,529 initiators of DPP-4 inhibitors and 114,417 of sulfonylureas. We fit Cox proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for prostate cancer. We weighted the models using propensity score fine stratification, which considered over 50 potential confounders.  Results:   GLP-1 receptor agonists were associated with a decreased risk of prostate cancer when compared with sulfonylureas (incidence rates = 156.4 vs. 232.0 per 100,000 person-years, respectively; HR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.43, 0.99).

Digital health coaching has shown promise as a tool to positively influence outcomes. We completed a single-arm pilot study to assess the feasibility of digital health coaching in men with prostate cancer.  Methods:   Men with a history of prostate cancer requiring treatment in the past 2 years were eligible for inclusion. Participants engaged in a 12-week health coaching program, consisting of a combination of at least one telephone call and up to four digital nudges (defined as content delivered via text, e-mail, or app on the basis of the participant's preference) per week. Prostate cancer-specific content addressed one of the following topics each week: fatigue, pain management, healthy eating, exercise, managing incontinence, sexual health, managing stress and anxiety, financial toxicity, goal setting during treatment, managing side effects, communicating with the health care team, and medication adherence. Services were provided at no cost to the participant.  Results:   A hundred patients were consented for the study, and 88 enrolled. The feasibility threshold of 60% was met with 63 of the 88 enrolled individuals completing the 3-month program (proportion = 71.6%; 90% CI, 62.6 to 79.4; P = .016).

This was accomplished through an iterative process that included 2 survey rounds and multidisciplinary working groups.  Results:   There were 591 and 706 survey respondents in the first and second rounds, respectively, with most having had localized prostate cancer (58.1%). Survey participants represented 45 states in the U.S. Five of the top 11 prioritized research questions related to treatment decision making and/or survivorship care. The following had the highest overall importance ratings: What is the comparative effectiveness of different 1) strategies to improve counseling regarding the side effects of prostate cancer treatment, 2) tools for decision making in localized prostate cancer and 3) sequences of treatments for metastatic prostate cancer?  Conclusions:   We present a unique, patient-centered list of prioritized research questions among prostate cancer patients and their caregivers. These research questions may inform funding decisions for organizations that support research, and should be considered as priorities for clinicians, researchers and institutions conducting prostate cancer research. Prostate cancer is a common disease that affects 1 in 9 men over their lifetime. Researchers usually identify questions to study without asking men with prostate cancer.

Here, in a genetically engineered mouse model, combining TMPRSS2-driven ERG with KrasG12D led to invasive prostate adenocarcinomas, while ERG or KrasG12D alone were non-oncogenic. In primary prostate luminal epithelial cells, following inducible oncogenic Kras expression or Pten depletion, TMPRSS2-ERG suppressed oncogene-induced senescence, independent of TP53 induction and RB1 inhibition. Oncogenic KRAS and TMPRSS2-ERG synergized to promote tumorigenesis and metastasis of primary luminal cells.

Here, we investigated their accuracy for the assessment of lymph node (LN) metastases validated by histopathology. Methods: Data from 58 patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy receiving salvage surgery after PET imaging with 18F-rhPSMA-7 or 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 were retrospectively reviewed. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed all PET scans and morphologic imaging in consensus. Readers were masked from the results of histopathology. PET and morphologic imaging were correlated with histopathology from resected LNs. Results: In 75 of 150 resected regions in 54 of 58 patients, tumor lesions were present in histopathology. The template-based specificity of PET (18F-rhPSMA-7 and 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 combined) and morphologic imaging was 93.3% and 100%, respectively. However, 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET detected metastases in 61 of 75 histopathologically proven metastatic LN fields (81.3%) whereas morphologic imaging was positive in only 9 of 75 (12.0%). The positive predictive value was 92.4% for 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET and 100% for morphologic imaging. 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 PET performance was significantly superior to morphologic imaging (difference in the areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves, 0.222; 95% CI, 0.147-0.298; P < 0.001). The mean size of PET-positive and histologically confirmed LN metastases was 6.3 ± 3.1 mm (range, 2-15 mm) compared with a mean size of 9.8 ± 2.5 mm (range, 7-15 mm) on morphologic imaging.

Thus, the optimal management of APC patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is complex. In October 2021, during the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2021, the 73 voting members of the panel members discussed and voted on 13 questions on this topic that could help clinicians make treatment choices during the pandemic. There was a consensus for full COVID-19 vaccination and booster injection in APC patients. Furthermore, the voting results indicate that the expert's treatment recommendations are influenced by the vaccination status: the COVID-19 pandemic altered management of APC patients for 70% of the panellists before the vaccination was available but only for 25% of panellists for fully vaccinated patients. Most experts (71%) were less likely to use docetaxel and abiraterone in unvaccinated patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. For fully vaccinated patients with high-risk localised prostate cancer, there was a consensus (77%) to follow the usual treatment schedule, whereas in unvaccinated patients, 55% of the panel members voted for deferring radiation therapy. Finally, there was a strong consensus for the use of telemedicine for monitoring APC patients.

Identifying factors associated with stage at diagnosis can help reduce lung cancer morbidity and mortality. This study used data from a prospective cohort study of adults living in Alberta, Canada to examine factors associated with lung cancer stage at diagnosis.  Methods:   This cohort study used data from adults aged 35-69 years enrolled in Alberta's Tomorrow Project. Partial Proportional Odds models were used to examine associations between sociodemographic characteristics and health-related factors and subsequent lung cancer stage at diagnosis.  Results:   A total of 221 participants (88 males and 133 females) developed lung cancer over the study period. Nearly half (48.0%) of lung cancers were diagnosed at a late stage (stage IV), whereas 30.8 % and 21.3% were diagnosed at stage I/II and III, respectively. History of sunburn in the past year was protective against late-stage lung cancer diagnosis (odds ratio (OR) .40, P=.005). In males, a higher number of lifetime prostate specific antigen tests was associated with reduced odds of late-stage lung cancer diagnosis (odds ratio .66, P=.02). Total recreational physical activity was associated with increased odds of late-stage lung cancer diagnosis (OR 1.08, P=.01).  Discussion:   Lung cancer stage at diagnosis remains a crucial determinant of prognosis. This study identified important factors associated with lung cancer stage at diagnosis.

Methods:   We acquired the RNA-seq data of 406 patients with PCa from the TCGA database. Based on the mRNA stemness index (mRNAsi) calculated by one-class logistic regression (OCLR) algorithm, SRGs in PCa were extracted by WGCNA. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were applied to uncover OS-associated SRGs. Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and Pearson's correlation analysis were performed to discover the possible mechanism of PCa metastasis. The significantly correlated transcription factors of OS-associated SRGs were also identified by Pearson's correlation analysis. ChIP-seq was applied to validate the binding relationship of TFs and OS-associated SRGs and spatial transcriptome and single-cell sequencing were performed to uncover the location of key biomarkers expression. Lastly, we explored the specific inhibitors for SRGs using CMap algorithm.  Results:   We identified 538 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between non-metastatic and metastatic PCa. Furthermore, OS-associated SRGs were identified. The Pearson correlation analysis revealed that FOXM1 was significantly correlated with NEIL3 (correlation efficient =0.89, p < 0.001) and identified hallmark_E2F_targets as the potential pathway mechanism of NEIL3 promoting PCa metastasis (correlation efficient =0.58, p < 0.001). Single-cell sequencing results indicated that FOXM1 regulating NEIL3 may get involved in the antiandrogen resistance of PCa. Rottlerin was discovered to be a potential target drug for PCa.

In addition, we conducted a comparison with usual care (UC).  Methods:   Patients scheduled for (neo)adjuvant oncological treatment (n = 577) were randomly assigned to 6 months of combined resistance and endurance training of HI or LMI. A longitudinal descriptive study (UC) included participants (n = 89) immediately before the RCT started. HRQoL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline, 3, 6 and 18 months (1 year after completed exercise intervention) follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to study the groups over time.  Results:   Directly after the intervention, HI scored significant (P = 0.02), but not clinically relevant, higher pain compared with LMI. No other significant difference in HRQoL was found between the exercise intensities over time. Clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL over time were detected within both exercise intensities. We found favourable significant differences in HRQoL in both exercise intensities compared with UC over time.  Conclusion:   This study adds to the strong evidence of positive effect of exercise and shows that exercise, regardless of intensity, can have beneficial effects on HRQoL during oncological treatment and also for a substantial time after completion of an exercise intervention.

Conjugation of scFvD2B to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) would enhance its stability and plasma half-life circulation to shuttle theranostic agents in PC. In this study, we synthesized PEGylated scFvD2B-AuNPs (AuNPs-scFvD2B-PEG) and tested their integrity, biocompatibility, and immunogenicity in freshly withdrawn human blood. Prior to blood incubation, Zeta potential measurements, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were used to assess the physicochemical properties of our nano-complexes in the presence or absence of PEGylation. A surface plasmon resonance band shift of 2 and 4 nm confirmed the successful coating for AuNPs-scFvD2B and AuNPs-scFvD2B-PEG, respectively. Likewise, DLS revealed a size increase of ∼3 nm for AuNPs-scFvD2B and ∼19 nm for AuNPs-scFvD2B-PEG. Zeta potential increased from -34 to -19 mV for AuNPs-scFvD2B and reached -3 mV upon PEGylation. Similar assessment measures were applied post-incubation in human blood with additional immunogenicity tests, such as hemolysis assay, neutrophil function test, and pyridine formazan extraction. Interestingly, grafting PEG chains on AuNPs-scFvD2B precluded the binding of blood plasma proteins and reduced neutrophil activation level compared with naked AuNPs-citrate counterparts.

Methods and materials:   We randomized patients with intermediate- to high-risk localized prostate cancer to radiation therapy with MHF (70 Gy in 28 daily fractions) or UHF (36.25 Gy in 5 weekly fractions). We analyzed early toxic effects (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/Subjective, Objective, Management, Analytic scales) and patient-reported quality of life (using the Expanded Prostate Inventory Composite questionnaire) when all patients had at least 6 months of follow-up.  Results:   We randomized 80 participants. Two patients withdrew from radiation therapy. We ran analysis on results for 78 patients. The 2 arms were balanced in key patient and disease characteristics, except for a statistically worse baseline urinary function in the UHF arm (International Prostate Symptom Score >7: 68% vs 36%, P = .004). There were no statistically significant differences between the 2 arms in grade 3 or grade 2 toxic effects: grade ≥3 MHF 8%, UHF 2% (P = .235); grade ≥2 MHF 36%, UHF 24% (P = .235).

We hypothesized that incorporating PET would result in larger clinical target volumes (CTVs) without increasing patient-reported toxic effects.  Methods and materials:   From 2012 to 2019, 165 postprostatectomy patients with detectable prostate-specific antigen were randomized (arm 1 [no PET]: 82; arm 2 [PET]: 83). Prostate bed target volumes with (CTV1: 45.0-50.4 Gy/1.8 Gy) or without (CTV2/CTV: 64.8-70.2 Gy/1.8 Gy) pelvic nodes, as well as organ-at-risk doses, were compared pre- versus post-PET (arm 2) using the paired t test and between arms using the t test. Patient-reported outcomes used International Prostate Symptom Score and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite for Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP). Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed and linear mixed models were fitted.  Results:   Median follow-up of the whole cohort was 3.52 years. All patients had baseline patient-reported outcomes, 1 patient in arm 1 and 3 patients in arm 2 withdrew, and 4 arm 2 patients had extrapelvic uptake on PET with radiotherapy aborted, leaving 81 (arm 1) and 76 patients (arm 2) for analysis of toxic effects. Mean CTV1 (427.6 vs 452.2 mL; P = .462, arm 1 vs arm 2) and CTV2/CTV (137.18 vs 134.2 mL; P = .669) were similar before PET incorporation. CTV1 (454.57 vs 461.33 mL; P = .003) and CTV2/CTV (134.14 vs 135.61 mL; P < .001) were modestly larger after PET incorporation.

To understand their safety profiles in real-world settings, we examined the association between the use of abiraterone or enzalutamide and the risk of metabolic or cardiovascular adverse events while on treatment.  Methods:   Men with advanced prostate cancer and their use of abiraterone or enzalutamide were identified in a 20% sample of the 2010-2017 national Medicare claims. The primary composite outcome was the occurrence of a major metabolic or cardiovascular adverse event, defined as an emergency room visit or hospitalization associated with a primary diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease. The secondary composite outcome was the occurrence of a minor metabolic or cardiovascular adverse event, defined as an outpatient visit associated with a primary diagnosis of the aforementioned conditions. Risks were assessed separately for abiraterone and enzalutamide using Cox regression. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   Compared with men not receiving abiraterone, men receiving abiraterone were at increased risk of both a major composite adverse event (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.53 to 2.05; P < .001) and a minor composite adverse event (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.47; P = .01). Compared with men not receiving enzalutamide, men receiving enzalutamide were at an increased risk of a major composite adverse event (HR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.48; P = .04) but not a minor composite adverse event (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.30; P = .75).

Patients and methods:   The phase Ib portion utilized a 3+3 design with escalating daily oral doses of 4.5-81 mg and increasing schedule in 39 patients with mCRPC treated with one or more androgen receptor-targeting agents. Prior taxane chemotherapy was allowed. The phase II portion tested a daily dose of 63 mg in 41 patients with no prior chemotherapy. Efficacy was assessed using PCWG3 and RECIST 1.1 criteria.  Results:   The MTD was not defined in the phase Ib and the recommended phase II dose was set at 63 mg/day. The most common adverse events (>10% frequency) at the 63 mg oral daily dosing (combined phase Ib/II data) were predominantly grade 1-2 events. Grade ≥3 events included diarrhea (7.4%), fatigue (5.6%), and alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase elevations (5.6% and 3.7%, respectively). Neurotoxicity and neutropenia were not observed. Preliminary efficacy data in patients treated with ≥1 continuous cycle of 63 mg or higher included objective response rate in 6 of 29 (20.7%) patients with measurable disease (1 complete, 5 partial) and 14 of 48 (29.2%) patients had PSA declines.

Methods:   The investigators implemented a cross-sectional study and enrolled a sample of Thai post-GAS TGW without medical background. Predictor variables were categorized as demographic, clinical, operative, or postoperative. The outcome variable was PCA (yes/no). Appropriate statistics were computed, and a p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

It stimulates tumour growth and metastasis, but its role in the radioimmune responses remain unknown. We aimed to explore the impacts of PCAT1 on tumorigenesis and radioimmune responses and the underlying molecular mechanisms in NSCLC.  Methods:   Comprehensive bioinformatics analysis was performed to identify immunosuppressive lncRNAs involved with tumour invasion in NSCLC. The expression levels of PCAT1 were analysed by in situ hybridisation in 55 paired NSCLC tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Both loss- and gain-of-function assays were performed to examine the effects of PCAT1 and SOX2 on NSCLC cell behaviours in vivo and in vitro. Bioinformatic analyses, chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP) and dual-luciferase reporter assays were applied to validate the regulatory effects of PCAT1 on SOX2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase and rescue assays were utilised to identify the relationship between SOX2 and the cGAS/stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signalling.  Results:   PCAT1 was immunosuppressive and related with NSCLC invasion. Increased PCAT1 was negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in NSCLC. PCAT1 knockdown restrained proliferation, increased apoptosis, and repressed cell metastasis in vivo and in vitro. PCAT1 activated SOX2 that accelerated tumorigenesis and immunosuppression. SOX2 promoted tumour growth through inhibiting cytotoxic T-cell immunity. Moreover, SOX2 restrained cGAS transcription and hampered downstream type I interferon (IFN)-induced immune responses. Inhibition of PCAT1/SOX2 in collaboration with radiation further inhibited tumour growth, and initiated the cGAS/STING signalling pathway, which enhanced the immune responses of radiotherapy in NSCLC.  Conclusions:   PCAT1/SOX2 axis promoted tumorigenesis and immunosuppression through inhibition of cGAS/STING signalling-mediated T-cell activation.

Deubiquitinases, the enzymes that specifically hydrolyze ubiquitin chains on their substrates, were recently proposed as a serious of critical therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Our previous study has been reported that the ubiquitin specific peptidase 1 (USP1) functionally acts as a deubiquitinase of sine oculis homeobox homolog 1 (SIX1) and contributes to the proliferation and castration resistance of PC. The stabilization of SIX1 by USP1 partially depends on the status of glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75). In this study, we aimed to identify a SIX1 degradation inducer via inhibiting the USP1-SIX1 axis. we screened a range of kinase inhibitors and showed that SNS-032 is the best candidate to trigger the ubiquitinated degradation of SIX1. SNS-032 not only restrains activity of the USP1-SIX1 axis and cell cycle progression, but also results in apoptosis of PC cells. Moreover, the combination of SNS-032 and enzalutamide synergistically induces apoptosis and downregulates expression of USP1, SIX1, and AR/AR-V7 in AR-V7 highly expressed 22Rv1 cells.

HN1 is a highly expressed gene in prostate cancer and controls the levels of several cell cycle regulatory proteins including Cyclin B1. Cyclin B1 is a cell cycle control protein but is also involved in Docetaxel and 2-Methoxyestradiol induced apoptosis. Since Cyclin B1 level may affect chemotherapy success and HN1-Cyclin B1 negative correlation has already been shown, so in this study, we investigated the possible role of HN1 in chemotherapeutic resistance in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   Androgen-dependent and independent prostate cancer cells were used in the study. A full-length human HN1 cDNA fragment was cloned to a mammalian expression vector and this construct was used for overexpression experiments. A siRNA that specifically targets HN1 was used for HN1 depletion experiments. Evaluation of apoptosis was performed by the level of PARP cleavage and an apoptosis kit that measure Caspase 3 activity.  Results:   The HN1 protein level is decreased in the Docetaxel or 2-Methoxyestradiol treated LNCaP and PC-3 PCa cells whereas the Cyclin B1 level is increased. HN1 overexpression inhibited Docetaxel and 2-Methoxyestradiol induced apoptosis. In concordance, its depletion further stimulated apoptosis in drug-treated cells. However, silencing of Cyclin B1 along with HN1 abolished the increased apoptotic response induced by silencing of HN1 in Docetaxel or 2-Methoxyestradiol treated cells.

Our previous studies showed that APMs are strong outcome predictors of urinary continence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We now use machine learning to investigate how surgeon performance (i.e., APMs) and clinical factors can predict positive surgical margins (PSMs) after RARP. Methods: We prospectively collected data of patients undergoing RARP at our institution from 2016 to 2019. Random Forest model predicted PSMs based on 15 clinical factors and 38 APMs from 11 standardized RARP steps. Out-of-bag Gini impurity index determined the top 10 variables of importance (VOI). APMs in the top 10 VOI were assessed for confounding effects by extracapsular extension (ECE) and pathologic T (pT) through Poisson regression with Generalized Estimating Equation. Results: 55/236 (23.3%) cases had PSMs. Of the 55 cases with PSMs, 9 (16.4%) were pT2 and 46 (83.6%), pT3. The full model, including clinical factors and APMs, achieved area under the curve (AUC) 0.74. When assessing clinical factors or APMs alone, the model achieved AUC 0.72 and 0.64, respectively. The strongest PSM predictors were ECE and pT stage, followed by APMs in specific steps. After adjusting for ECE and pT stage, most APMs remained as independent predictors of PSM. Conclusion: Using machine learning methods, we found that the strongest predictors of PSMs after RARP are nonmodifiable, disease-driven factors (ECE and pT). While APMs provide minimal additional insight into when PSMs may occur, they are nonetheless capable of independently predicting PSMs based on objective measures of surgeon performance.""","""['Ryan S Lee', 'Runzhuo Ma', 'Stephanie Pham', 'Jacqueline Maya-Silva', 'Jessica H Nguyen', 'Manju Aron', 'Steven Cen', 'Siamak Daneshmand', 'Andrew J Hung']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Survival Analysis Using Surgeon Skill Metrics and Patient Factors to Predict Urinary Continence Recovery After Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Surgeon Automated Performance Metrics as Predictors of Early Urinary Continence Recovery After Robotic Radical Prostatectomy-A Prospective Bi-institutional Study.', 'Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting oncologic outcome after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Methods for training of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Exploring the Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Management of Prostate Cancer.']"""

This retrospective study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of MRI to detect pathological ATI (pathATI) in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy specimens. They found patients with radATI more likely to develop biochemical recurrence (BCR), p = 0.003, and have apical positive surgical margins (APSM), p = 0.004. We believe that the author's acknowledgement of the relationship between tumor location and cancer risk is an important step in the classification of prostate cancer. An important question that is under addressed is, what is it about apical tumors that carry additional risk? Higher rates of PSM due to incomplete surgical excision may contribute to increased recurrence risk in the apex. If this is the case, surgical management must be tailored by a tumor location-based risk assessment. The literature suggests that a single APSM may be clinically insignificant for long-term outcomes. Conversely, the authors also recommend radATI be treated with reduced apical nerve sparing to avoid APSM. We believe that this approach may lead to overtreatment in the presence of an otherwise good prognosis. We believe the extent of APSMs upon diagnosis would be an interesting topic for further investigation. The authors may also wish to perform multivariable analysis for the effect of radATI on BCR.

Studies have reported that uncarboxylated osteocalcin (GluOC) promotes the development of prostate and other cancers. Studies have also found elevated levels of serum osteocalcin in breast cancer patients with bone metastasis, and serum osteocalcin can be a marker of bone metastasis. However, whether GluOC promotes the development of TNBC and the related mechanisms need to be further clarified.  Results:   Our results revealed that GluOC is associated with the proliferation and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. GluOC increased the viability and proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, GluOC enhanced the metastatic ability of MDA-MB-231 cells by promoting the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP13), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We also found that GluOC upregulated the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) genes in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Moreover, the promoting effect of GluOC was reversed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with specific inhibitor of SMAD3 (SIS3), a SMAD3 phosphorylation inhibitor.  Conclusion:   Our research proved for the first time that GluOC facilitates the proliferation and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells by accelerating the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)/SMAD3 signaling pathway. Moreover, GluOC also promotes the gene expression of IL-8 and PTHrP. Both IL-8 and PTHrP can act as osteolytic factors in breast cancer cells.

However, the trials on assessing the chemo-preventive or therapeutic potential of ER targeting drugs or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have not yet established their clinical benefits. This could be ascribed to a possible modulation in the ER expression during PCa progression. Further it is warranted to test various ER targeting drugs in appropriate preclinical models that simulate human ER expression pattern during PCa progression. The study was undertaken to revisit the existing data on the epithelial ER expression pattern in human cancerous prostates and experimentally determine whether these patterns are replicated in TRAMP (Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of Mouse Prostate) mice, a model for human PCa. Estradiol (E2) binding to the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells and its modulation during the PCa progression in TRAMP were also investigated. A reassessment of the existing data revealed a trend towards downregulation in the epithelial expression of wild-type ESR1 transcripts in high-grade PCa, compared to non-cancerous prostate in humans. Next, epithelial cell-enriched populations from TRAMP prostates (TP) displaying low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (LGPIN), high-grade PIN (HGPIN), HGPIN with well-differentiated carcinoma (PIN + WDC), WDC (equivalent to grade 2/3 human PCa), and poorly-differentiated carcinoma (PDC-equivalent to grade 4/5 human PCa) revealed significantly higher Esr1 and Esr2 levels in HGPIN and significantly reduced levels in WDC, compared to respective age-matched control prostates. These patterns for the nuclear ERs were similar to the trend shown by E2 binding to the plasma membrane of the epithelial cells during PCa progression in TRAMP.

It relied on m6A modification in the mRNAs of cancer-related genes to regulate tumour progression. The development of prostate cancer cells could be promoted by METTL3 via hedgehog pathway. Recent studies had shown that the effect of METTL3 on non-coding RNA was mainly dependent on the modification of m6A. However, it is still unknown whether METTL3 promotes tumour development through this mechanism in prostate cancer. The expression of METTL3 in prostate cancer tissues and cells was analysed by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay and transwell assays were conducted to detect the impact of METTL3 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Nude mice tumour models were built to evaluate the role of METTL3 in tumorigenesis. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA immunoprecipitation assay (MeRIP) and co-immunoprecipitations assays were performed to verified that METTL3 upregulated the m6A level, interacted with microprocessor protein DGCR8, recognized the m6A modification of pre-miR-182 to regulate its maturation.METTL3 was highly expressed in prostate cancer, and knockdown of METTL3 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis, while overexpression of METTL3 promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenesis in PCa. In addition, we found that METTL3 upregulating the level of m6A, and interacted with DGCR8 to recognize the m6A modification of pre-miR-182 to regulate its splicing and maturation and promote the high expression of miRNA.

Objective:   We aimed to evaluate and compare treatment persistence and re-initiation with different bone-targeting agents among patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  Methods:   This population-based cohort study included patients with bone metastasis with breast, lung, or prostate cancer who initiated bone-targeting agents, including denosumab, zoledronic acid, and pamidronate in Taiwan (2013-17), Hong Kong (2013-17), and Korea (2012-16). We described the patients' persistence with bone-targeting agents, by evaluating the interruption probability, and compared risks of treatment interruption. The rates of re-initiation with index bone-targeting agents were evaluated.  Results:   We included 5127 patients (denosumab: 3440, zoledronic acid: 1210, pamidronate: 477) from Taiwan, 883 patients (denosumab: 458, zoledronic acid: 357, pamidronate: 68) from Hong Kong, and 4800 patients (zoledronic acid: 4068, pamidronate: 732) from Korea. Compared with zoledronic acid, denosumab had a lower risk of interruption in Taiwan (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.44; 95% confidence interval 0.40-0.48) and Hong Kong (0.36; 0.28-0.45). However, pamidronate was more likely to be interrupted than zoledronic acid in Taiwan (1.31; 1.11-1.54) and Korea (2.06; 1.83-2.32), but not in Hong Kong (1.13; 0.71-1.78). After discontinuation, original treatments with denosumab in Taiwan and zoledronic acid in Hong Kong were more likely to be resumed, while in Korea, the rates were similar among the bisphosphonates.

This study sought to determine priority issues facing men with PCa, barriers and enablers to accessing care and whether health professionals (HPs) and men would support the inclusion of a patient-reported outcome (PRO) comparator tool.  Methods:   We conducted four online focus groups with HPs recruited from healthcare services in Victoria, followed by seven online codesign workshops with men with PCa, recruited through the Victorian Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry, Prostate Cancer Foundation Australia and the Cancer Council Victoria. Men were eligible to participate if they had lived experience of PCa and access to the internet. We analysed focus groups thematically. Workshops were analysed using descriptive-content analysis.  Results:   HPs (n = 39) highlighted that men had shifting priorities over time, but noted the importance of providing information to men in lay terms to assist in treatment decision-making and side-effect management. HPs identified key enablers to men accessing support services such as practice nurses, partners and having men share their stories with each other. HPs raised financial, cultural, geographic and emotional barriers to accessing supportive care. Inclusion of a PRO comparator tool received mixed support from HPs, with 41% (n = 16) supportive, 49% (n = 19) unsure and 10% (n = 4) not supportive. Men involved in workshops (n = 28) identified informational needs to assist in treatment decision-making and side-effect management as the top priority throughout care. Men described support groups and practice nurses as key enablers. Short consultation times and complex information were described as barriers. Unlike HPs, all men supported the inclusion of a PRO comparator tool in a portal.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that a patient support portal should provide information in lay terms that address the shifting priorities of men with PCa. Men with PCa would welcome the development of a portal to centralize support information and a PRO comparator tool to prompt health-seeking behaviour. Future research will implement these findings in the development of a portal, and pilot and evaluate the portal within a population-based sample.  Patient or public contribution:   This project adopted a codesign approach including both men with PCa and HPs involved in PCa care. Men with PCa also formed part of the study's steering committee and consumer advisory groups. HPs were consulted in a serious of online focus groups. Subsequently, men with PCa and their support persons participated in workshops.

Neutrophils are the most abundant immune cells in human peripheral blood, and large numbers can spontaneously migrate to metastatic sites, where they form an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Polysialic acid (PSA) can target peripheral blood neutrophils (PBNs) mediated by L-selectin, and abemaciclib (ABE) and mitoxantrone (MIT) can treat immunosuppressive microenvironments. Here, we aimed to inhibit lung metastasis of breast cancer and improve chemoimmunotherapy by designing a PSA-modified ABE and MIT co-delivery system (AM-polyion complex (PIC)) to target PBNs in mice with metastatic tumors. We found that through electrostatic interactions between the strong negative charge of PSA and the positive charge of the drug can form stable nanocomplexes and that spontaneous migration of neutrophils can mediate the aggregation of these complexes in the lungs, induce antimetastatic immune responses, enhance the effectiveness of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and inhibit regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation in vivo and in vitro.

Artificial in vitro 3D culture models, such as spheroids, are therefore being designed to allow intercellular interactions between tumor cells and the matrix, under hypoxic conditions mimicking a microtumor. This project aims to develop and characterize a multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model of human prostate cancer cells expressing PSMA, for in vitro drug screening. To this end, 1,000 cells/well were seeded in 100 µl of culture medium with 0.5% of methylcellulose in 96-well, non-adherent, V-shaped bottom plates. Bioluminescent imaging of the spheroids enabled the measurement of spheroid growth. From Day 7 of growth, immunofluorescence studies showed cellular proliferation (Ki-67), mainly located in the periphery of the spheroid section, associated with the formation of an apoptotic core (TUNEL). Scanning electron microscopy and fluorescent imaging (Lox-1 probe) showed the presence of an extracellular matrix and the installation of an oxygen gradient leading to the formation of a hypoxic area during growth. This hypoxia was correlated with increased VEGF excretion. Drug sensitivity was assessed on 2D and 3D cultures. The LNCaP-Luc spheroids are more resistant to docetaxel and TH-302, a hypoxia-activated prodrug, compared with cells grown in a monolayer. For docetaxel, this resistance increased with the spheroid growth stage, whereas the activity of TH-302 was potentiated by the hypoxic environment.

In their various manifestations, EMT programs enable epithelial cells to enter into a series of intermediate states arrayed along the E-M phenotypic spectrum. At present, we lack a coherent understanding of how carcinoma cells control their entrance into and continued residence in these various states, and which of these states favour the process of metastasis. Here we characterize a layer of EMT-regulating machinery that governs E-M plasticity (EMP). This machinery consists of two chromatin-modifying complexes, PRC2 and KMT2D-COMPASS, which operate as critical regulators to maintain a stable epithelial state. Interestingly, loss of these two complexes unlocks two distinct EMT trajectories. Dysfunction of PRC2, but not KMT2D-COMPASS, yields a quasi-mesenchymal state that is associated with highly metastatic capabilities and poor survival of patients with breast cancer, suggesting that great caution should be applied when PRC2 inhibitors are evaluated clinically in certain patient cohorts.

ECI1, residing at the 16p13.3 gain region, encodes Δ3, Δ2-Enoyl-CoA Delta Isomerase 1 (ECI1), a key mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation enzyme. Although deregulated mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is known to drive PCa pathogenesis, the role of ECI1 in PCa is still unknown. We investigated the impacts of ECI1 on PCa phenotype in vitro and in vivo by modulating its expression in cell lines and assessed the clinical implications of its expression in human prostate tissue samples. In vitro, ECI1 overexpression increased PCa cell growth while ECI1 deficiency reduced its growth. ECI1 also enhanced colony formation, cell motility, and maximal mitochondrial respiratory capacity. In vivo, PCa cells stably overexpressing ECI1 injected orthotopically in nude mice formed larger prostate tumors with higher number of metastases. Immunohistochemistry analysis of the human tissue microarray representing 332 radical prostatectomy cases revealed a stronger ECI1 staining in prostate tumors compared to corresponding benign tissues. ECI1 expression varied amongst tumors and was higher in cases with 16p13.3 gain, high Gleason grade, and advanced tumor stage. ECI1 overexpression was a strong independent predictor of biochemical recurrence after adjusting for known clinicopathologic parameters (hazard ratio: 3.65, P < 0.001) or the established CAPRA-S score (hazard ratio: 3.95, P < 0.001).

However, the clinical significance of cancer detection on T-Bx, followed by definitive treatment, needs to be further investigated. We herein investigated unique cohorts of patients with prostate cancer detected on systematic sextant biopsy (S-Bx) and/or T-Bx.  Materials and methods:   We assessed consecutive patients who had undergone T-Bx with concurrent S-Bx (6 sites, ≥12 cores), followed by radical prostatectomy from 2015 to 2019. Within our Surgical Pathology database, we identified a total of 222 men who met the inclusion criteria for prostatic adenocarcinoma on either S-Bx or T-Bx, or both (B-Bx). Radical prostatectomy findings and oncologic outcomes were then compared among groups.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected on S-Bx only (n = 32; 14%), T-Bx only (n = 40; 18%), or B-Bx (n = 150; 68%). Compared to cases with cancer detected on S-Bx only, those on T-Bx only or B-Bx showed significantly higher tumor grade (highest Grade Group in each patient) on biopsy and significantly larger estimated tumor volume on prostatectomy. There were no significant differences in tumor volume on biopsy, tumor grade on prostatectomy (except S-Bx vs. B-Bx), pT or pN stage category, surgical margin status, or preoperative prostate-specific antigen level between cases where cancer was detected on S-Bx only vs. T-Bx only or B-Bx. There were also no significant differences in any of these clinicopathologic features between cancers detected on T-Bx only vs. B-Bx. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of biochemical recurrence after prostatectomy in patients whose cancer was detected on T-Bx only (P = 0.020) or B-Bx (P = 0.032) than in those on S-Bx only. No significant difference in recurrence-free survival between T-Bx only vs. B-Bx cases (P = 0.601) was seen. In multivariate analysis, cancer detection on T-Bx only (vs. S-Bx only) showed significance for recurrence (hazard ratio = 8.482, P = 0.045).  Conclusions:   Detection of prostate cancer on T-Bx, in addition to or instead of S-Bx, was found to be associated with larger tumor volume as well as worse prognosis.

With the discovery of its overexpression in PCa and the alternative splicing of its pre-RNA to generate an oncogenic C-terminally modified isoform named PACE4-altCT, understanding and validating its value as a potential biomarker is of great interest either from prognostic or targeted therapy intervention. Expression of ERG in LNCaP cells was used to investigate the relationship between ERG expression occurring in PCa cells and PACE4-altCT expression by Western blot and qPCR. Using immunohistochemistry, the expression levels of PACE4 isoforms in patient tissues were investigated and correlated with ERG tumor status and Gleason score. An ELISA method was developed using affinity purified recombinant protein and used for quantitative analysis of plasma concentrations of PACE4-altCT and used for correlation. In contrast with the consensual isoform, PACE4-altCT was only strongly overexpressed in prostate cancer patients, correlated with ERG expression levels. Despite its intracellular retention PACE4-altCT could be detected in the plasma of most patients with prostate cancer, whereas it was only found at low levels in normal patients whereas total plasmatic PACE4 levels did not vary significantly between groups.

Methods:   Candidates were patients treated with either SEED-BT (n = 933) or RP (n = 334). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to adjust the patients' backgrounds. We compared the biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free rate using the Phoenix definition (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] nadir plus 2 ng/mL) for SEED-BT and the surgical definition (PSA cut-off value of 0.2 ng/mL) for RP. We also directly compared the BCR-free rates using the same PSA cut-off value of 0.2 ng/mL for both SEED-BT and RP.  Results:   In the propensity score-matched analysis with 214 pairs, the median follow-up treatment was 96 months (range 1-158 months). Fifty-three patients (24.7%) were treated with combined SEED-BT and external-beam radiotherapy. Forty-three patients (20.0%) received salvage radiotherapy after RP. Comparing the BCR-free rate using the above definitions for SEED-BT and RP showed that SEED-BT yielded a significantly better 8-year BCR-free rate than did RP (87.4% vs. 74.3%, hazard ratio [HR] 0.420, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.273-0.647).

SEED-BT had a significantly better 8-year salvage hormonal therapy-free rate than did RP (92.0% vs. 85.6%, HR 0.528, 95% CI 0.296-0.942, P = 0.030).

However, there is limited data on costs associated with prostate cancer in low- and middle-income countries particularly in the sub-Saharan region. From a societal perspective, this study aims to estimate the cost of prostate cancer in Eswatini.  Methods:   This prevalence-based cost-of-illness study used diagnosis specific data from national registries to estimate costs associated to prostate cancer during 2018. The prevalence-based approach was used employing both top down and bottom up costing approaches. Costs data included health care utilization, transport, sick leave days and premature death.  Results:   The total annual cost of prostate cancer was $6.2 million (ranging between $ 4.7 million and 7.8 million estimated with lower and upper bounds). Average cost-per patient for radiotherapy, chemotherapy and other non-medical direct costs (transport and lodging) were the highest cost drivers recording $16,648, $7,498 and $5,959 respectively whilst indirect costs including productive loss due to sick leave and pre-mature mortality was estimated at $58,320 and $113,760 respectively. Cost of managing prostate cancer increased with advanced disease and costs were highest for prostate cancer stages III and IV recording $1.1million, $1.9million respectively.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer is a public health concern in Eswatini, and it imposes significant economic burden to the society.

The data show that fetuin-A (alpha 2HS glycoprotein) is the serum protein that mediates 3-D growth in these cells. It does so by sequestering extracellular vesicles of various sizes on the surfaces of rounded cells that grow as spheroids. These vesicles in turn transmit growth signals such as the activation of AKT and MAP kinases in a pattern that differs from the activation of these key growth signaling pathways in adherent and spread cells growing in 2-D. In the process of orchestrating the movement and disposition of extracellular vesicles on these cells, fetuin-A is readily internalized in adhered and spread cells but remains on the surfaces of non-adherent cells.

This research aims to utilize a risk assessment approach to demonstrate the association of EP and PB exposures detected in the urine samples along with PCa in US men (NHANES data 2005−2015). Further, we employ integrated bioinformatics to examine how EP and PB exposure influences the molecular pathways associated with the progression of PCa. The odds ratio, multiple regression model, and Pearson coefficients were used to evaluate goodness-of-fit analyses. The results demonstrated associations of EPs, PBs, and their metabolites, qualitative and quantitative variables, with PCa. The genes responsive to EP and PB exposures were identified using the Comparative Toxicogenomic Database (CTD). DAVID.6.8, GO, and KEGG enrichment analyses were used to delineate their roles in prostate carcinogenesis. The plug-in CytoHubba and MCODE completed identification of the hub genes in Cytoscape software for their roles in the PCa prognosis. It was then validated by using the UALCAN database by evaluating the expression levels and predictive values of the identified hub genes in prostate cancer prognosis using TCGA data. We demonstrate a significant association of higher levels of EPs and PBs in the urine samples, categorical and numerical confounders, with self-reported PCa cases. The higher expression levels of the hub genes (BUB1B, TOP2A, UBE2C, RRM2, and CENPF) in the aggressive stages (Gleason score > 8) of PCa tissues indicate their potential role(s) in the carcinogenic pathways.

Nanodrug delivery systems (NDDS) have been widely applied in drug delivery for tumor therapy; however, nanotherapeutics encounter various biological barriers that prevent successful accumulation of drugs, specifically at diseased sites. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a CRPC-targeting nanocomposite with fine biocompatibility for penetrating various biological barriers, delivering sufficient drugs to the targeting site and improving therapeutic efficiency. In this work, CRPC cell membranes were firstly adapted as biomimetic vectors for the encapsulating PEG-PLGA polymer containing the chemotherapy drug docetaxel (DTX). The CRPC membrane-camouflaged nanoparticles can easily escape early recognition by the immune system, penetrate the extracellular barrier, and evade clearance by the circulatory system. In addition to the characteristics of traditional nanoparticles, the CRPC cell membrane contains an arsenal of highly specific homotypic moieties that can be used to recognize the same cancer cell types and increase the targeted drug delivery of DTX. In vivo fluorescence and radionuclide dual-model imaging were fulfilled by decorating the biomimetic nanosystem with near-infrared dye and isotope, which validated the homotypic targeting property offered by the CRPC cell membrane coating. Importantly, remarkably improved therapeutic efficacy was achieved in a mice model bearing CRPC tumors.

This study investigated the effects of 17α-EE2 on the growth, photosynthetic activity, and antioxidant system of C. pyrenoidosa and revealed related molecular changes using transcriptomic analysis. The cell density of algae was inhibited in the presence of 17α-EE2, and cell morphology was also altered. Photosynthetics were damaged, while reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased. Further transcriptomic analysis revealed that the pathways of photosynthesis and DNA replication were affected at three concentrations of 17α-EE2, but several specific pathways exhibited various behaviors at different concentrations. Significant changes in differentially expressed genes and their enrichment pathways showed that the low-concentration group was predominantly impaired in photosynthesis, while the higher-concentration groups were biased towards oxidative and DNA damage.

Additionally, solid cancer, including lung, prostate, and colon cancer, are characterized by hypoxia. A low-oxygen state is facilitated by the oncogene pathway, which correlates with a poor cancer prognosis. Thus, we need to understand the related mechanisms in solid tumors to improve and develop new anticancer strategies. The experiments herein describe an anticancer mechanism in which heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) stabilizes HIF-1α, a master transcription factor of oxygen homeostasis that has been implicated in the survival, proliferation and malignant progression of cancers. We demonstrate the efficacy of 6-gingerol and the molecular mechanism by which 6-gingerol inhibits LC metastasis in different oxygen environments. Our results showed that cell proliferation was inhibited after 6-gingerol treatment. Additionally, HIF-1α, a transcriptional regulator, was found to be recruited to the hypoxia response element (HRE) of target genes to induce the transcription of a series of target genes, including MMP-9, vimentin and snail. Interestingly, we found that 6-gingerol treatment suppressed activation of the transcription factor HIF-1α by downregulating HSP90 under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, an experiment in an in vivo xenograft model revealed decreased tumor growth after 6-gingerol treatment. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses showed the inhibition of metastasis through HIF-1α/HSP90 after 6-gingerol treatment. In summary, our study demonstrates that 6-gingerol suppresses proliferation and blocks the nuclear translocation of HIF-1α and activation of the EMT pathway. These data suggest that 6-gingerol is a candidate antimetastatic treatment for LC.""","""['Min Jeong Kim', 'Jin Mo Ku', 'Yu-Jeong Choi', 'Seo Yeon Lee', 'Se Hyang Hong', 'Hyo In Kim', 'Yong Cheol Shin', 'Seong-Gyu Ko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['C-Terminal HSP90 Inhibitors Block the HIF-1 Hypoxic Response by Degrading HIF-1α through the Oxygen-Dependent Degradation Pathway.', 'Gingerol prevents prion protein-mediated neuronal toxicity by regulating HIF prolyl hydroxylase 2 and prion protein.', 'Radiosensitization of normoxic and hypoxic h1339 lung tumor cells by heat shock protein 90 inhibition is independent of hypoxia inducible factor-1α.', 'RACK1 vs. HSP90: competition for HIF-1 alpha degradation vs. stabilization.', 'Non-canonical approaches to targeting hypoxic tumors.', 'JI017 Induces Cell Autophagy and Apoptosis via Elevated Levels of Reactive Oxygen Species in Human Lung Cancer Cells.', 'Tumor cell plasticity in targeted therapy-induced resistance: mechanisms and new strategies.']"""

The lack of preclinical models for advanced stage PC represents one of the primary barriers in understanding the key genetic drivers of aggressive subsets, including androgen receptor (AR) pathway active and AR-null castration-resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). In our studies, we described a series of LuCaP patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models representing the major genomic and phenotypic features of human disease. To fully exploit the potential of these preclinical models, we carried out a comprehensive transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of 42 LuCaP PDX prostate tumors. The collected proteomic data (~6000 data points) based on 71 antibodies revealed many of the previously known molecular markers associated with AR-positive and AR-null CRPC. Genomic analysis indicated subtype-specific activation of pathways such as Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, mTOR, and oxidative phosphorylation for AR-positive CRPC and upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and glucose metabolism for AR-null CRPC. Of these, we functionally confirmed the role of mitochondrial metabolism in AR-positive CRPC cell lines.

Methods:   KRT7 expression was evaluated in prostatic cell lines and in human tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC, on advanced PC, n = 91) and immunofluorescence (IF, on localized PC, n = 285). The KRT7 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was quantified in different compartments by digital analysis and correlated to clinical endpoints in the localized PC cohort.  Results:   KRT7 is expressed in prostatic cell lines and found in the basal and supra-basal compartment from healthy prostatic glands and benign peri-tumoral glands from localized PC. The KRT7 staining is lost in luminal cells from localized tumors and found as an aberrant sporadic staining (2.2%) in advanced PC. In the localized PC cohort, high KRT7 MFI above the 80th percentile in the basal compartment was significantly and independently correlated with MFS and CSS, and with hypertrophic basal cell phenotype.

However, the role and mechanism of SNHG7 in PCa metabolism remain largely undefined.  Methods:   A cohort of 30 PCa tumors and their counterparts were collected. qRT-PCR was employed to detect target gene expression and RNA stability. CCK-8 assay was used to assess cell viability. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) level was measured by a commercial kit. Cell glycolysis was evaluated by measuring glucose uptake, lactate, ATP production and Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Bioinformatics analysis and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were used to verify the interactions among SNHG7, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1) and c-Myc.  Results:   SNHG7 and c-Myc were highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. Methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated m6A modification of SNHG7 and enhanced its stability.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of abiraterone plus prednisone, with or without radiotherapy, in addition to standard of care.  Methods:   We conducted an open-label, randomised, phase 3 study with a 2 × 2 factorial design (PEACE-1) at 77 hospitals across Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Switzerland. Eligible patients were male, aged 18 years or older, with histologically confirmed or cytologically confirmed de novo metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1 (or 2 due to bone pain). Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) to standard of care (androgen deprivation therapy alone or with intravenous docetaxel 75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks), standard of care plus radiotherapy, standard of care plus abiraterone (oral 1000 mg abiraterone once daily plus oral 5 mg prednisone twice daily), or standard of care plus radiotherapy plus abiraterone. Neither the investigators nor the patients were masked to treatment allocation. The coprimary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival. Abiraterone efficacy was first assessed in the overall population and then in the population who received androgen deprivation therapy with docetaxel as standard of care (population of interest). This study is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01957436.  Findings:   Between Nov 27, 2013, and Dec 20, 2018, 1173 patients were enrolled (one patient subsequently withdrew consent for analysis of his data) and assigned to receive standard of care (n=296), standard of care plus radiotherapy (n=293), standard of care plus abiraterone (n=292), or standard of care plus radiotherapy plus abiraterone (n=291). Median follow-up was 3·5 years (IQR 2·8-4·6) for radiographic progression-free survival and 4·4 years (3·5-5·4) for overall survival. Adjusted Cox regression modelling revealed no interaction between abiraterone and radiotherapy, enabling the pooled analysis of abiraterone efficacy. In the overall population, patients assigned to receive abiraterone (n=583) had longer radiographic progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·54, 99·9% CI 0·41-0·71; p<0·0001) and overall survival (0·82, 95·1% CI 0·69-0·98; p=0·030) than patients who did not receive abiraterone (n=589). In the androgen deprivation therapy with docetaxel population (n=355 in both with abiraterone and without abiraterone groups), the HRs were consistent (radiographic progression-free survival 0·50, 99·9% CI 0·34-0·71; p<0·0001; overall survival 0·75, 95·1% CI 0·59-0·95; p=0·017). In the androgen deprivation therapy with docetaxel population, grade 3 or worse adverse events occurred in 217 (63%) of 347 patients who received abiraterone and 181 (52%) of 350 who did not; hypertension had the largest difference in occurrence (76 [22%] patients and 45 [13%], respectively). Addition of abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel did not increase the rates of neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, or neuropathy compared with androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel alone.  Interpretation:   Combining androgen deprivation therapy, docetaxel, and abiraterone in de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer improved overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival with a modest increase in toxicity, mostly hypertension. This triplet therapy could become a standard of care for these patients.

Here, we used a CRISPR activation screen in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer cells to identify genes that promote resistance to AR inhibitors. Activation of the TGFβ target gene paired-related homeobox2 (PRRX2) promoted enzalutamide resistance. PRRX2 expression was the highest in double-negative prostate cancer (DNPC), which lack AR signaling and neuroendocrine differentiation, and a PRRX2-related gene signature identified a subset of patients with DNPC with reduced overall survival. PRRX2-expressing cells showed alterations in the CDK4/6/Rb/E2F and BCL2 pathways. Accordingly, treatment with CDK4/6 and BCL2 inhibitors sensitized PRRX2-expressing, castration-resistant tumors to enzalutamide. Overall, PRRX2 was identified as a driver of enzalutamide resistance. The PRRX2 signature merits investigation as a biomarker of enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer that could be reversed with CDK4/6 and BCL2 inhibitors.

However, the role of testosterone in atopic diseases has remained undefined. We aimed to investigate this role.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective cohort study was conducted using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Patients with prostate cancer were categorized into two groups according to whether they received GnRH analogue treatment (study group I) or not (study group II), and men without prostate cancer and with no GnRH analogue use were defined to comprise the comparison group after their ages and index years were matched with group II. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) of atopic diseases.  Results:   Group I, group II, and the comparison group comprised 663, 2,172, and 8,688 individuals, respectively. Group I had a significantly lower risk of atopic diseases (adjusted HR: 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.89, p < 0.01) than did group II. A reduced risk of atopic diseases was found when GnRH analogues were prescribed for 2 months (adjusted HR 0.53, 95% CI, 0.29-0.97, p = 0.04) and 2-14 months (adjusted HR 0.66, 95% CI, 0.49-0.89, p = 0.007). No significant difference in the risk of atopic diseases between group II and the comparison group was observed.

The aim of this study was to compare IQ and prostate cancer (PC) detectability between DWI with ssEPI using SENSE (EPIS) and using C-SENSE (EPICS).  Materials and methods:   Twenty-five patients with pathologically proven PC underwent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging at 3T. DW images acquired with EPIS and EPICS were assessed for the following: lesion conspicuity (LC), SNR, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), mean and standard deviation (SD) of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of lesion (lADCm and lADCsd), coefficient of variation of lesion ADC (lADCcv), and mean ADC of benign prostate (bADCm).  Results:   LC were comparable between EPIS and EPICS (p > 0.050), and SNR and CNR were significantly higher in EPICS than EPIS (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001). In both EPIS and EPICS, lADCm was significantly lower than bADCm (p < 0.001). In addition, lADCcv was significantly lower in EPICS than in EPIS (p < 0.001).

Materials and methods:   Within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2015), 4975 NCCN high-risk patients were identified. In the development cohort (SEER geographic region of residence: South, North-East, Mid-West, n = 2456), we fitted a multivariable logistic regression model predicting SVI.

Results:   Out of 4975 patients, 28% had SVI. SVI rate ranged from 8% to 89% according to clinical T stage, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), biopsy Gleason Grade Group and percentage of positive biopsy cores. In the development cohort, these variables were independent predictors of SVI. In the external validation cohort, the current model achieved 77.6% accuracy vs 73.7% for Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) vs 68.6% for Gallina et al. Calibration was better than for the two alternatives: departures from ideal predictions were 6.0% for the current model vs 9.8% for MSKCC vs 38.5% for Gallina et al. In DCAs, the current model outperformed both alternatives. Finally, different nomogram cutoffs allowed to discriminate between low versus high SVI risk patients.

Herein, we investigated the etiology of HFD-induced inflammatory cancer growth and the involvement of the gut microbiome. The expression of Hdc, the gene responsible for histamine biosynthesis, and histamine levels were upregulated in large prostate tumors of HFD-fed mice, and the number of mast cells increased around the tumor foci. Administration of fexofenadine, a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, suppressed tumor growth in HFD-fed mice by reducing the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and suppressing IL6/STAT3 signaling. HFD intake induced gut dysbiosis, resulting in the elevation of serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS increased Hdc expression in PCa. Inhibition of LPS/Toll-like receptor 4 signaling suppressed HFD-induced tumor growth.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for PCa (6747 incident cases) across seven sleep traits (sleep duration, chronotype, insomnia, snoring, nap, difficulty to get up in the morning, and daytime sleepiness). In addition, we newly created a healthy sleep quality score according to sleep traits to assess the impact of the overall status of night and daytime sleep on PCa development. E values were used to assess unmeasured confounding.  Results:   We identified 6747 incident cases, of which 344 died from PCa. Participants who usually suffered from insomnia had a higher risk of PCa (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.19, E value: 1.46). Finding it fairly easy to get up in the morning was also positively associated with PCa (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.04-1.15, E value: 1.40). Usually having a nap was associated with a lower risk of PCa (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83-0.99, E value: 1.42).  Conclusions:   Fairly easy to get up in the morning and usually experiencing insomnia were associated with an increased incidence of PCa. Moreover, usually having a nap was associated with a lower risk of PCa. Therefore, sleep behaviors are modifiable risk factors that may have a potential impact on PCa risk.""","""['Xiaoyan Lv', 'Yuxin Li', 'Rong Li', 'Xiangyun Guan', 'Li Li', 'Junli Li', 'Shucheng Si', 'Xiaokang Ji', 'Yingjuan Cao', 'Fuzhong Xue']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Sleep Duration, Chronotype, and Insomnia and the Risk of Lung Cancer: United Kingdom Biobank Cohort.', 'Investigation of the relationships between sleep behaviors and risk of healthspan termination: a prospective cohort study based on 323,373 UK-Biobank participants.', 'Relationships between sleep traits and lung cancer risk: a prospective cohort study in UK Biobank.', 'Association of sleep behaviour and pattern with the risk of glaucoma: a prospective cohort study in the UK Biobank.', 'Self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, chronotype and the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI): a prospective study in the UK Biobank and the HUNT Study.', 'Sleep and breast and prostate cancer risk in the MCC-Spain study.']"""

Makino (G. pentaphyllum) is a natural herbal drug that has been widely used to treat many diseases. The antitumor effects of G. pentaphyllum were first described in the illustrated catalog of plants. Gypenosides are the major active components of G. pentaphyllum, and they have been widely reported to possess antitumor effects in prostate cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colon cancer, lung cancer, and breast cancer. However, research on the use of gypenoside in the treatment of bladder cancer has not been conducted. In this study, we explored the potential molecular mechanisms of gypenosides in the treatment of bladder cancer using network pharmacology and experimental validation. First, we used a network pharmacology-based method to identify both the effective components of gypenosides and the molecular mechanism underlying their antibladder cancer effects. The results were further confirmed by molecular docking, CCK8 and colony formation assays, and cell cycle and cell apoptosis analyses. Additionally, a mouse xenograft model of bladder cancer was used to investigate the antitumor effect of gypenosides in vivo. We identified 10 bioactive ingredients and 163 gene targets of gypenosides. Network exploration suggested that VEGFA, STAT3, and PI3KCA may be candidate agents for the antibladder cancer effect of gypenosides. In addition, analysis of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway revealed that the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway may play a crucial role in the mechanism of action of gypenosides against bladder cancer. Molecular docking revealed that gypenosides combine well with PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. As expected, gypenosides displayed apoptosis-inducing properties in bladder cancer cells by inactivating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in vitro. Furthermore, gypenosides significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cells in vivo. Mechanistically, gypenosides induced the apoptosis of bladder cancer cells via inactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.""","""['Xiuming Li', 'Hui Liu', 'Chengcheng Lv', 'Jun Du', 'Fangchao Lian', 'Shouyi Zhang', 'Zhiyong Wang', 'Yu Zeng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Mechanism of gypenosides of Gynostemma pentaphyllum inducing apoptosis of renal cell carcinoma by PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.', 'A network pharmacology approach and experimental validation to investigate the anticancer mechanism and potential active targets of ethanol extract of Wei-Tong-Xin against colorectal cancer through induction of apoptosis via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Effects of heat-processed Gynostemma pentaphyllum on high-fat diet-fed mice of obesity and functional analysis on network pharmacology and molecular docking strategy.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Natural products targeting the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway in cancer: A novel therapeutic strategy.', 'A Novel Combination of Sotorasib and Metformin Enhances Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis in KRAS-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cell Lines through MAPK and P70S6K Inhibition.', 'Inhibition of the AKT1/mTOR pathway through SIRT6 over expression downregulated the expression of programmed death-ligand 1 and prolonged overall survival in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive serum metabolomics and network analysis to reveal the mechanism of gypenosides in treating lung cancer and enhancing the pharmacological effects of cisplatin.', 'Gypenosides ameliorate ductular reaction and liver fibrosis via inhibition of hedgehog signaling.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

PCa is usually asymptomatic at the early stage and the specificity of the current biomarkers for the detection of PCa is low. The present study evaluates circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood or urine, which can be used as biomarkers of PCa and the combination of these markers may increase the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of PCa.  Methods:   Tissue, blood, and urine samples were collected from patients with PCa. All prostate tissue specimens underwent pathological examination. A hybrid-capture-based next-generation sequencing assay was used for plasma and urinary ctDNA profiling. Sequencing data were analyzed by an in-house pipeline for mutation calling. Mutational profiles of PCa and BPH were compared in both plasma and urine samples. Associations of detected mutations and clinical characteristics were statistically analyzed.  Results:   A significant association of mutation allele frequencies (MAFs) in the blood samples with patients with metastatic PCa rather than patients with primary PCa, and MAFs are changed after treatment in patients with PCa. Further, the number of mutations in urine is not associated with clinical characteristics of PCa patients, but the frequencies of mutation alleles in the urine are associated with patient age. Comparison of cfDNA aberration profiles between urine and blood reveals more alterations in urine than in blood, including TP53, AR, ATM, MYC, and SPOP mutations.  Conclusion:   This work provides the potential clinical application of urine, in addition to blood, as a powerful and convenient non-invasive approach in personalized medicine for patients with PCa.""","""['Gang Chen', 'Guojin Jia', 'Fan Chao', 'Feng Xie', 'Yue Zhang', 'Chuansheng Hou', 'Yong Huang', 'Haoran Tang', 'Jianjun Yu', 'Jihong Zhang', 'Shidong Jia', 'Guoxiong Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Somatic mutation detection using various targeted detection assays in paired samples of circulating tumor DNA, primary tumor and metastases from patients undergoing resection of colorectal liver metastases.', 'Concordance of Circulating Tumor DNA and Matched Metastatic Tissue Biopsy in Prostate Cancer.', 'High MAF of EGFR mutations and high ratio of T790M sensitizing mutations in ctDNA predict better third-generation TKI outcomes.', 'Using circulating cell-free DNA to monitor personalized cancer therapy.', 'Circulating tumor DNA as an emerging liquid biopsy biomarker for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Cell-free DNA in the management of prostate cancer: Current status and future prospective.', 'Integrated analysis of single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing identifies a signature based on macrophage marker genes involved in prostate cancer prognosis and treatment responsiveness.', 'Liquid Biopsy in Prostate Cancer Management-Current Challenges and Future Perspectives.']"""

Whether brucine can regulate apoptosis in prostate cancer cells through the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) has not been reported. We preliminarily investigated the effects of brucine on the mitochondrial apoptosis and HSP70 expression of prostate cancer cells and analyzed brucine's possible mechanisms in the hope of providing an experimental basis for its clinical application.  Methods:   The effect of brucine on the activity of PC-3 cells was determined by the methodology of tetrazolium (MTT) assay method. The effect of brucine on apoptosis was measured by Hoechst 33258 staining and flow cytometry, and western blotting was used to detect the expression levels of the apoptosis-related heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), anti-apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) and anti-cysteine protease-3 (caspase-3).  Results:   At 24 and 48 h, the activity of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells in the low, medium, and high dose brucine groups was significantly lower than that of the control group, with a dose-dependent difference (P<0.01). The nuclei of the control group fluoresced uniformly with intact nuclei, whereas the nuclei of the brucine group appeared crinkled, and dense granular masses of strong blue fluorescence were visible. The apoptosis rate of human prostate cancer PC-3 cells in the low, medium, and high dose brucine groups was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.01) and was dose-dependent. The expression levels of the HSP70 protein in the human prostate cancer PC-3 cells in the low, medium, and high dose brucine groups were significantly lower than those in the control group, while the expression levels of the Apaf-1 and caspase-3 proteins were significantly higher than those in the control group (P<0.01) and showed a dose-dependent relationship.

This study aimed to adapt a previously suggested indicator for its use in a clinical context and to evaluate it in a real-world, population-based cohort of cancer patients.  Materials and methods:   An improved version of the '30-day mortality after SACT' indicator suggested by Wallington et al. (Lancet Oncol 2016; 17:1203-16) was defined. All SACTs (n = 16 622) for all patients (n = 10 213) treated for common malignancies between 2009 and 2019 in the North Denmark Region were included. The results for the improved and Wallington's indicators were calculated and compared.  Results:   Overall, the association between clinical variables and 30-day mortality following SACT was similar for both indicators, except for the 75+ years age group. However, Wallington's indicator showed varying absolute risk when comparing values for quarterly and yearly observation intervals. The improved and Wallington's indicators showed large differences between curative (1.0% and 1.1%, respectively) and palliative SACTs (9.1% and 11.7%, respectively). For palliative SACTs, different types of malignancy presented with large variations for the improved indicator, ranging from above 10% for gastroesophageal, pancreatic and lung cancers to below 4% for prostate cancers. The value of the improved indicator was significantly lower in the last years of the study period compared with the 2009-2011 period. The type of malignancy was also associated with significant differences.  Conclusions:   We defined an indicator adapted to the clinical context evaluating 30-day mortality following SACT. This indicator can be used to identify risk factors to help with clinical decision-making.

Bladder instillation with glycosaminoglycan replacement therapy (GRT) including hyaluronic acid +/- chondroitin sulphate has been proposed as an emerging alternative to prevent relapses of haematuria. Strong points in favour of using GRT for RHC are the ease of administration, cost, almost absence of side effects and possibility of administration to outpatients. We investigated the effectiveness of GRT in a cohort, single-centre, of patients with past-medical history of PRT attending the outpatient clinic and/or the accident & emergency department (A&E) for RHC.  Materials & methods:   Patients with diagnosis of RHC, either with toxicity grade of 2 or 3, were deemed candidate for GRT as long as no active bleeding was occurring; in the case of non-self-limiting haematuria and/or anaemia for active bleeding, admission in the urology department was prompted for bleeding control prior to GRT instillation. An induction course of 6 weekly instillations was scheduled; if tolerated, patients were given a maintenance course with at least 6 monthly instillations. The primary end-point consisted in assessing the rate of haematuria remission (either partial or complete) defined as no need to readmission in the A&E and/or in the hospital. Secondary end-points included factors related to GRT failure. Univariate and multivariate analysis were undertaken to identify clinical independent variables associated to the events.  Results:   Fifty-one patients with at least 1-year follow-up from the first GRT were included in the analysis. 88.2, 9.8 and 2% of patients had undergone PRT because affected by prostate, uterus and colorectal cancer, respectively. Median time-to-RHC was 31 months (IQR 21-90). Access to A&E and hospital admission were needed in 47 (92.1%) and 35 (68.6%) of the patients, respectively. Twenty-two (n = 22/35, 62.9%) patients required transurethral fulguration of the bladder, while the remainders could be managed with bladder wash-out. Median number of GRT instillations was 6 (IQR 3-7). Twenty-three (45.1%) patients needed to be readmitted to hospital a second time, receiving bladder wash-out (n = 7/23, 30.4%), transurethral fulguration of the bladder (n = 10/23, 43.5%) and/or cystectomy (n = 6/23, 26.1%). Ten (19.6%) patients received a second induction course of GRT. At the last follow-up, 36 (70.6%) patients did not required further hospital admission. Type of PRT and number of hospital admissions pre-GRT were the only variables statistically associated to the events at both univariate (P = 0.032 and P = 0.045) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.048 and P = 0.049).  Conclusions:   GRT should be prompted as soon as possible after diagnosis of the haematuria and settling of active bleeding. Patients who had undergone adjuvant PRT after radical prostatectomy are those at higher risk of GRT failure.""","""['Francesco Sanguedolce', 'Iacopo Meneghetti', 'Giulio Bevilacqua', 'Benjamin Montaño', 'Christian Martínez', 'Angelo Territo', 'Josep Balaña', 'Joan Palou', 'Alberto Breda']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Efficacy of sodium hyaluronate in the management of chemical and radiation cystitis.', 'Treatment of acute iatrogenic cystitis secondary to bladder chemo-immuno-instillation or pelvic radiotherapy.', 'Intravesical administration of combined hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate can improve symptoms in patients with refractory bacillus Calmette-Guerin-induced chemical cystitis: Preliminary experience with one-year follow-up.', 'Radiation-induced hemorrhagic cystitis-possible treatment options!.', 'Diagnosis and management of superficial bladder cancer.']"""

Advances in DNA sequencing tools and our understanding of gene behavior have revealed that complex diseases, such as cancer, are the product of genes cooperating with each other and with their environment in orchestrated communication networks.

Areas covered:   The literature search focused on three types of cancer, namely breast, lung, and prostate, but arguments from other cancers were also included. The aim was to prove that multigene analyses can accurately predict and prognosticate cancer risk, subtype cancer for more personalized and effective treatments, and discover anti-cancer therapies. Computational intelligence is being harnessed to analyze this type of data and is proving indispensable to scientific progress.

High-sensitivity assays can effectively aid clinical decision-making and intervene in cancer in a localized status before they metastasize and become unmanageable. Meanwhile, it is equally pivotal to prevent overdiagnosis of non-life-threatening cancer by eliminating unnecessary treatment and repeated blood draws. Unfortunately, current clinical screening methodologies can hardly simultaneously attain sufficient sensitivity and specificity, especially under resource-restrained circumstances. To circumvent such limitations, particularly for cancer biomarkers from early-onset and recurrence, we aim to develop a universal plasmonic platform for clinical applications, which macroscopically amplifies multiplexed fluorescence signals in a broad spectral window and readily adapts to current assay setups without sophisticated accessories or expertise at low cost.  Methods:   The plasmonic substrate was chemically synthesized in situ at the solid-liquid interface by rationally screening a panel of reducing monosaccharides and tuning the redox reactions at various catalyst densities and precursor concentrations. The redox properties were studied by Benedict's assay and electrochemistry. We systemically characterized the morphologies and optical properties of the engineered plasmonic Ag structures by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and spectroscopy. The structure-fluorescence enhancement correlation was explicitly explained by the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and a computational model for gap distribution. Next, we established an enhanced fluoroimmunoassay (eFIA) using a model biomarker for prostate cancer (PCa) and validated it in healthy and PCa cohorts. Prognosis was explored in patients subject to surgical and hormonal interventions following recommended PCa guidelines.  Results:   The monosaccharide-mediated redox reaction yielded a broad category of Ag structures, including sparsely dispersed nanoparticles (NPs) of various sizes, semi-continuous nanoislands, and crackless continuous films. Optimal broad-spectral fluorescence enhancement from green to far-red was observed for the inhomogeneous, irregularly-shaped semi-continuous Ag nanoisland substrate (AgNIS), synthesized from a well-balanced redox reaction at a stable rate mediated by mannose. In addition, different local electric field intensity distributions in response to various incident excitations were observed at the nanoscale, elucidating the need for irregular and inhomogeneous structures. AgNIS enabled a maximized 54.7-fold macroscopically amplified fluorescence and long-lasting photostability. Point-of-care availability was fulfilled using a customized smartphone prototype with well-paired optics. The eFIA effectively detected the PCa marker in cell lines, xenograft tumors, and patient sera. The plasmonic platform rendered a diagnostic sensitivity of 86.0% and a specificity of 94.7% and capably staged high-grade PCa that the clinical gold standard test failed to stratify. Patient prognosis of robotic-assisted surgeries and hormone therapies was non-invasively monitored following efficient medical interventions. The assay time was significantly curtailed on the plasmonic platform upon microwave irradiation.  Conclusions:   By investigating the effects of reducing monosaccharides on the seed-mediated chemical synthesis of plasmonic Ag structures, we deduced that potent multiplexed fluorescence enhancement originated from both an adequate reducing power and a steady reduction rate. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous structure with adequate medium gap distances afforded optimal multiwavelength fluorescence enhancement, thus empowering an effective eFIA for PCa. The clinically validated diagnostic and prognostic features, along with the low sample volume, point-of-care feasibility with a smartphone, and microwave-shortened assay time, warrant its potential clinical translation for widespread cancer biomarker analysis.""","""['Mengyao Liu#', 'Yonghong Li#', 'Wei Xing', 'Yuqin Zhang', 'Xi Xie', 'Jiadong Pang', 'Fangjian Zhou', 'Jiang Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nanobiotechnology""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Influence of Random Plasmonic Metasurfaces on Fluorescence Enhancement.', 'Design and Clinical Verification of Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Diagnostic Technology for Individual Cancer Risk Prediction.', 'Multiplexed Prostate Cancer Companion Diagnostic Devices.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

We aimed to evaluate the rate of pathologic upgrading in patients with very low (VLR) or LR prostate cancer after prostatectomy.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Database (NCDB) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Database were queried for patients diagnosed with Gleason 6 prostate cancer and prostate specific antigen (PSA) < 10 ng/mL from 2010 to 2016. All patients underwent 12-core biopsy and a subsequent prostatectomy for final pathologic staging. Our primary outcome was rate of pathologic upgrading over the study period.  Results:   A total of 35,332 patients from the NCDB and 7,186 patients from the SEER database were collected. Patient population had an average age of about 59 years old and was over 80% white. Mean pre-biopsy PSA was higher for the upgraded cohorts in the NCDB and SEER populations (5.3 versus 4.9 and 5.5 versus 5.1 respectively, p < 0.001). Upgraded cohorts were more likely to have a higher percentage of positive cores at biopsy (p < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that increasing age, increasing PSA and year of diagnosis were all predictors of upgrading (p < 0.05) in both databases. African American race was significantly associated with upgrading in the NCDB database only (p = 0.001). Over the studied time period, the rate of upgrading at prostatectomy increased from 41.2% to 56.7% in the NCDB population and from 41.9% to 45.4% in the SEER population.  Conclusions:   The rate of pathologic upgrading of VLR and LR prostate cancer at prostatectomy has been increasing in recent years. Increasing age, pre-biopsy PSA and an increasing percentage of positive cores at biopsy are predictors of this outcome. This may relate to improved patient selection for active surveillance and definitive treatment.""","""['Facundo Davaro', 'David Weinstein', 'Ryan Wong', 'Sameer Siddiqui', 'Leslie Hinyard', 'Zachary Hamilton']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Can J Urol""","""['Risk of Pathologic Upgrading or Locally Advanced Disease in Early Prostate Cancer Patients Based on Biopsy Gleason Score and PSA: A Population-Based Study of Modern Patients.', 'Pathologic Outcomes of Gleason 6 Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated With Radical Prostatectomy: Implications for Active Surveillance.', 'Adverse Pathologic Findings for Men Electing Immediate Radical Prostatectomy: Defining a Favorable Intermediate-Risk Group.', 'Incidence and Predictors of Upgrading and Up Staging among 10,000 Contemporary Patients with Low Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Risk of Pathological Upgrading and Up Staging among Men with Low Risk Prostate Cancer Varies by Race: Results from the National Cancer Database.', 'Prognostic Impact and Clinical Implications of Unfavorable Upgrading in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.']"""

Methods:   All patients who underwent partial prostate excision/resection from 2004 to 2014 in Finland were retrospectively assessed for eligibility using a nationwide registry. Procedures were classified as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), laser vaporization of the prostate (laser), and open prostatectomy. Univariable and multivariable regression were used to analyze the association of age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), operation type, annual center operation volume, study era, atrial fibrillation, and prostate cancer diagnosis with 90 days postoperative mortality.  Results:   Among the 39,320 patients, TURP was the most common operation type for lower urinary tract symptoms in all age groups. The overall 90 days postoperative mortality was 1.10%. Excess mortality in the 90 days postoperative period was less than 0.5% in all age groups. Postoperative mortality after laser operations was 0.59% and 1.16% after TURP (p = 0.035). Older age, CCI score, and atrial fibrillation were identified as risk factors for postoperative mortality. Prostate cancer diagnosis and the center's annual operation volume were not significantly associated with mortality. The most common underlying causes of death were malignancy (35.5%) and cardiac disease (30.9%).  Conclusion:   Elective urologic procedures for BPH are generally considered safe, but mortality increases with age. Laser operations may be associated with lower mortality rates than the gold standard TURP. Thus, operative risks and benefits must be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis.

Population:   A total of 51 TZ PCa patients (age, 49-89), 44 stromal BPH (age, 57-92), and 45 glandular BPH patients (age, 56-92).  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T; T2WI turbo spin echo (TSE), quantitative T2*-weighted imaging, DWI echo planar imaging, 3D APTw TSE.  Assessment:   Differences in APTw, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and T2* among three lesions were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Regions of interest were drawn by two radiologists (X.Q.Z. and X.Y.Q., with 21 and 15 years of experience, respectively).  Statistical tests:   Multivariable logistic regression analyses; ANOVA with post hoc testing; receiver operator characteristic curve analysis; Delong test. Significance level: P < 0.05.  Results:   APTw among TZ PCa, stromal BPH, and glandular BPH (3.48% ± 0.83% vs. 2.76% ± 0.49% vs. 2.72% ± 0.45%, respectively) were significantly different except between stromal BPH and glandular BPH (P > 0.99). Significant differences were found in ADC (TZ PCa 0.76 ± 0.16 × 10-3 mm2 /sec vs. stromal BPH 0.91 ± 0.14 × 10-3 mm2 /sec vs. glandular BPH 1.08 ± 0.18 × 10-3 mm2 /sec) among three lesions. APTw (OR = 12.18, 11.80, respectively) and 1/ADC (OR = 703.87, 181.11, respectively) were independent predictors of TZ PCa from BPH and stromal BPH.

However, direct analysis of complex biological fluids such as plasma has been limited by the loss of sensitivity caused by biofouling. By increasing the surface area, the nanostructured electrode can improve detection sensitivity. However, like a double-edged sword, a large surface area increases the nonspecific adsorption of contaminating proteins. The use of nanoporous structures may prevent fouling proteins. However, there is no straightforward approach for creating nanostructured and nanoporous surfaces compatible with microfabricated thin-film electrodes. Herein, the preferential etching of chloride and surfactant-assisted anisotropic gold reduction to create homogeneous, nanostructured, and nanoporous gold electrodes is demonstrated, yielding a 190 ± 20 times larger surface area within a minute without using templates.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is temporally effective, whereas drug resistance inevitably develops. Abnormal expression of AR/ARV7 (the most common AR splicing variant) is critical for endocrine resistance, while the detailed mechanism is still elusive. In this study, bioinformatics and immunohistochemical analyses demonstrate that RNF8 is high expressed in PC and castration-resistant PC (CRPC) samples and the expression of RNF8 is positively correlated with the Gleason score. The high expression of RNF8 in PCs predicts a poor prognosis. These results provide a potential function of RNF8 in PC progression. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of RNF8 is positively correlated with that of AR in PC. Mechanistically, we find that RNF8 upregulates c-Myc-induced AR transcription via altering histone modifications at the c-Myc binding site within the AR gene. RNF8 also acts as a co-activator of AR, promoting the recruitment of AR/ARV7 to the KLK3 (PSA) promoter, where RNF8 modulates histone modifications. These functions of RNF8 are dependent on its E3 ligase activity. RNF8 knockdown further reduces AR transactivation and PSA expression in CRPC cells with enzalutamide treatment. RNF8 depletion restrains cell proliferation and alleviates enzalutamide resistance in CRPC cells.

Subsequent prostate biopsies should also be performed if MRI is positive, that is, Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) scores 3-5. However, several retrospective post hoc analyses have shown that this approach still leads to many unnecessary biopsy procedures. For example, 88%-96% of men with PI-RADS, three findings are still diagnosed with clinically non-significant prostate cancer or no cancer at all.  Methods and analysis:   This is a prospective, randomised, controlled, multicentre trial, being conducted in Finland, to demonstrate non-inferiority in clinically significant cancer detection rates among men undergoing prostate biopsies post-MRI and men undergoing prostate biopsies post-MRI only after a shared decision based on individualised risk estimation.

Recently, moderate hypofractionation with doses per fraction between 2.2 and 4 Gy has been shown to be safe and feasible with oncologic non-inferiority compared to normofractionation. Radiobiologic considerations lead to the assumption that prostate cancer might benefit in particular from hypofractionation in terms of tumor control and toxicity. First data related to ultrahypofractionation demonstrate that the overall treatment time can be reduced to 5-7 fractions with single doses > 6 Gy safely, even with simultaneous focal boosting of macroscopic tumor(s). With MR-guided linear accelerators (MR-linacs) entering clinical routine, invasive fiducial implantations become unnecessary. The aim of the multicentric SMILE study is to evaluate the use of MRI-guided stereotactic radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer in 5 fractions regarding safety and feasibility.  Methods:   The study is designed as a prospective, one-armed, two-stage, multi-center phase-II-trial with 68 patients planned. Low- and intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer patients will be eligible for the study as well as early high-risk patients (cT3a and/or Gleason Score ≤ 8 and/or PSA ≤ 20 ng/ml) according to d'Amico. All patients will receive definitive MRI-guided stereotactic radiation therapy with a total dose of 37.5 Gy in 5 fractions (single dose 7.5 Gy) on alternating days. A focal simultaneous integrated boost to MRI-defined tumor(s) up to 40 Gy can optionally be applied. The primary composite endpoint includes the assessment of urogenital or gastrointestinal toxicity ≥ grade 2 or treatment-related discontinuation of therapy. The use of MRI-guided radiotherapy enables online plan adaptation and intrafractional gating to ensure optimal target volume coverage and protection of organs at risk.  Discussion:   With moderate hypofractionation being the standard in definitive radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer at many institutions, ultrahypofractionation could be the next step towards reducing treatment time without compromising oncologic outcomes and toxicities. MRI-guided radiotherapy could qualify as an advantageous tool as no invasive procedures have to precede in therapeutic workflows. Furthermore, MRI guidance combined with gating and plan adaptation might be essential in order to increase treatment effectivity and reduce toxicity at the same time.""","""['J Ristau', 'J Hörner-Rieber', 'C Buchele', 'S Klüter', 'C Jäkel', 'L Baumann', 'N Andratschke', 'H Garcia Schüler', 'M Guckenberger', 'M Li', 'M Niyazi', 'C Belka', 'K Herfarth', 'J Debus', 'S A Koerber']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer (mirage): a phase iii randomized trial.', 'A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.', 'Magnetic resonance image-guided adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate cancer: preliminary results of outcome and toxicity.', 'Ultrahypofractionation of localized prostate cancer : Statement from the DEGRO working group prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance-Guided Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Radiotherapy on Combination MR-Linear Accelerators: Current Practice and Future Directions.', 'Robotic stereotactic body radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer: final analysis of the German HYPOSTAT trial.']"""

While radium-223 does improve pain and overall survival outcomes, the improvement can come at the expense of side effects such as bone marrow toxicity. The development of new and better treatment with long-standing pain relief is clearly an unmet medical need.  Methods:   The study is a non-randomized phase II study. The study population consists of 25 patients with CRPC who had progressed on any lines of prior therapies and whose serum testosterone level is less than 50 ng/dl and have metastatic lesions to at least two bone sites, with at least one site that has clinically meaningful pain at baseline (≥ 4 on an 11-point intensity scale). Eligible patients will be given two cycles of Sn-117 m-DTPA every 8 weeks or 56 days. Treatment will be administered by slow IV injection over 5-10 min. Retreatment after two cycles is allowed if patients meet the following retreatment criteria. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of Sn-117 m-DTPA on sustained pain response in patients with CRPC metastatic to at least two bone sites and at least one with clinically meaningful pain at baseline (≥ 4 on an 11-point pain intensity scale). Sustained pain response is defined as: 1) achieving pain index ≤ 3 within a 12-week period and 2) maintaining pain index ≤ 3 over a 16-week period. The secondary objectives are: safety and tolerability, measurement of Sn-117 m-DTPA activity by gamma-camera dosimetry scans, therapeutic efficacy, time to the first symptomatic skeletal event, duration of pain response, changes in PSA and ALP levels, patient-reported outcomes and progression free survival and overall survival.  Discussion:   Sn-117 m-DTPA is a unique bone-targeting theranostic radiopharmaceutical agent that selectively binds most heavily to bone metastases sites. This study will be the first prospective phase II trial to assess the pain efficacy and anti-tumor activity of Sn-117 m-DTPA in mCRPC with at least one clinically meaningful pain at baseline.

Results:   Results indicated that the clinical stage (P = 0.016), gender (P = 0.003), clinical T stage (P < 0.001), HPV 16 (P = 0.003), pathologic T stage (P = 0.002), and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.004) were associated with a homologous recombination deficiency high score (HRD-H) by logistic analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that HRD-H was an independent factor predicting survival with the adjustment of age, gender, clinical T stage, clinical N stage, and clinical M stage (HR 95 %CI 1.517; 1.128-2.039, P = 0.006). The proportion of tumor mutation burden-high (TMB-H) and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) patients in HRD-H patients are relatively low (9.97% and 0.0% respectively). A non-inflamed tumor microenvironment was also found in HRD-H patients. In our center, we found that two HRD-L HNSCC patients presented with an inflamed tumor microenvironment and had a good response to PD-1 therapy. Interestingly, the higher HRD score was 31 and was a non-responder to ICI treatment.  Conclusions:   HRD-H is associated with poor outcome in HNSCC patients. Those patients may benefit from PARPi treatment rather than ICIs treatment for its non-inflamed tumor microenvironment.""","""['Yu Chen', 'Xiaobin Zheng', 'Jing Lin', 'Xuan Gao', 'Jiani Xiong', 'Jun Liu', 'Zhaodong Fei', 'Chuanben Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oral Oncol""","""['Homologous recombination deficiency is inversely correlated with microsatellite instability and identifies immunologically cold tumors in most cancer types.', 'Pan-cancer analysis reveals homologous recombination deficiency score as a predictive marker for immunotherapy responders.', 'ESMO recommendations on predictive biomarker testing for homologous recombination deficiency and PARP inhibitor benefit in ovarian cancer.', 'PARP inhibitors in head and neck cancer: Molecular mechanisms, preclinical and clinical data.', 'Cracking the homologous recombination deficiency code: how to identify responders to PARP inhibitors.']"""

Materials and methods:   We evaluated all patients who underwent robotic prostatectomy by 3 urologic surgeons at our institution between January 2019 and October 2020. Demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data were collected and assessed. Patients were matched based on body mass index, Gleason group, and prostate volume using the optimal matching method.  Results:   Overall, 98 and 165 patients underwent single port and multiport robotic prostatectomy, respectively. Following propensity-score matching, 98 multiport cases were matched 1:1 to single port cases. The median operative time was lower for multiport (111.5 vs 147.0 minutes, P = .0000). Single port had a lower median estimated blood loss (50.0 vs 75.0 mL, P = .0006), pain score on postoperative day 0 (1.0 vs 2.0, P = .0004), opioid use at postoperative day 1 (0.0 [IQR 0.0-5.0] vs 0.0 MME [IQR 0.0-7.5], P = .0058), cumulative opioid use (2.0 vs 7.0 MME, P = .0008), and lymph node yield (4.0 vs 7.0 nodes, P = .0051). Single port had a greater percentage of men regain full erectile function by 6 months (23.8% vs 4.8%, P = .002).

The DART 01/05 trial was designed to determine whether long-term androgen deprivation is superior to short-term androgen deprivation when combined with high-dose radiotherapy. The 5-year results showed that 2 years of adjuvant androgen deprivation combined with high-dose radiotherapy significantly improved biochemical control, metastasis, and overall survival, especially in patients with high-risk disease. In this report, we present the 10-year final results of the trial.  Methods:   This open-label, phase 3, randomised, controlled trial was done in ten hospitals in Spain. The eligibility criteria included patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed T1c to T3, N0, and M0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate, according to the 2002 classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, with intermediate-risk and high-risk factors, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 100 ng/mL, and a Karnofsky performance score of at least 70%. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant short-term androgen deprivation (STAD) plus high-dose radiotherapy (minimum dose 76 Gy; median dose 78 Gy) or to receive the same treatment followed by 24 months of adjuvant long-term androgen deprivation (LTAD), via a randomisation scheduled generated by Statistical Analysis Software programme (version 9.1) and an interactive web response system. Patients assigned to the STAD group received 4 months of neoadjuvant and concomitant androgen deprivation (oral flutamide 750 mg per day or oral bicalutamide 50 mg per day) with subcutaneous goserelin (2 months before and 2 months combined with high-dose radiotherapy). Anti-androgen therapy was added during the first 2 months of treatment. Patients assigned to LTAD continued with goserelin every 3 months for another 24 months. The primary endpoint was biochemical disease-free survival at 5 years. For this 10-year study we analysed overall survival, metastasis-free survival, biochemical disease-free survival, and cause-specific survival. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is closed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02175212) and in the EU Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT 2005-000417-36).  Findings:   Between Nov 7, 2005, and Dec 20, 2010, 355 patients were enrolled. One patient in the STAD group withdrew from the trial, hence 354 participants were randomly assigned to STAD (n=177) or LTAD (n=177). The median follow-up was 119·4 months (IQR 100·6-124·3). The 10-year biochemical disease-free survival for LTAD was 70·2% (95% CI 63·1-77·3) and for STAD was 62·3% (54·9-69·7; hazard ratio [HR] 0·84; 95% CI 0·50-1·43; p=0·52). At 10 years, overall survival was 78·4% (72·1-84·8) for LTAD and 73·3% (66·6-80·0) for STAD (HR 0·84; 95% CI 0·55-1·27; p=0·40), and metastasis-free survival was 76·0% (69·4-82·7) for LTAD and 70·9% (64·0-77·8) for STAD (HR 0·90; 95% CI, 0·37-2·19; p=0·81). For the subgroup of high-risk patients, the 10-year biochemical disease-free survival was 67·2% (57·2-77·2) for LTAD and 53·7% (43·3-64·1) for STAD (HR 0·90; 95% CI 0·49-1·64; p=0·73), the 10-year overall survival was 78·5% (69·6-87·3) for LTAD and 67·0% (57·3-76·7) for STAD (HR 0·58; 95% CI 0·33-1·01; p=0·054), and the 10-year metastasis-free survival was 76·6% (95% CI 67·6-85·6) for LTAD and 65·0% (55·1-74·8) for STAD (HR 0·89; 95% CI 0·33-2·43; p=0·82). Only 11 (3%) of 354 patients died from prostate cancer, all of them in the high-risk subgroup (five in the LTAD group and six in the STAD group). 76 (21%) patients died from other causes (mainly second malignancies in 31 [9%] and cardiovascular disease in 21 [6%]). No treatment-related deaths were observed.  Interpretation:   After an extended 10-year follow-up, we were unable to support the significant benefit of LTAD reported at 5 years. However, the magnitude of the benefit was clinically relevant in high-risk patients. Intermediate-risk patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy do not benefit from LTAD.

For the first time, KCC-1-NH-DPA was synthesized and used to immobilization of biomacromolecules. So, fabricated immunosensor was performed by on sandwich-type strategy. After fabrication of immunosensor, cyclic voltammetry, differential pulse voltammetry, and square wave voltammetry techniques were used to electrochemical evaluation of immune-platform for PSA detection. The proposed biocompatibility immune-platform provided a novel interface toward sensitive bioanalysis of PSA biomarker in human plasma samples. Due to the use of gold nanoparticles functionalized Cysteamine (Cys A) in the structure of the secondary antibody (Ab2 [HRP-Ab2]), the intensity of the electrochemical signal has increased, resulting in a more accurate detection of the target molecules. Under the right conditions, the engineering immunosensor provides good bioanalytical performance for determining the PSA biomarker in the linear range of 0.002 to 60 μg L-1 which low limit of quantification was 0.002 μg L-1 .

Methods:   Fifteen primary PCa patients with intermediate- or high-risk score according to D'Amico risk stratification who had PSMA receptor affinity with Ga-68 PSMA-11 PET/CT were enrolled. After 99mTc-PSMA-I&S injection and SPECT/CT imaging, 99mTc-PSMA-RG-RALRP with DaVinci XI robotic platform and laparoscopic gamma probe were performed. Radioactive rating of resected tissue was compared with post-operative histopathology. Physiological and pathological uptakes of organs and tissues for both imaging modalities were compared.  Results:   Physiological radiotracer distribution was similar for both imaging modalities. PCa lesions were much more visible on PET/CT. Metastatic LNs could not be visualized with SPECT/CT. Eighteen of 297 totally dissected LNs were metastatic, which were exactly the same with per-operative probe counts with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and negative and positive predictive value of all 100%.

We investigated the association between urine SaMT and sleep quality deterioration in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) treated with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin induction therapy (iBCG).  Methods:   We enrolled 51 patients who received iBCG once weekly for 6 or 8 weeks. Patient-reported outcomes were assessed with questionnaires including the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQC30). Questionnaires were completed before (baseline), during, at completion, and 1 and 3 months after iBCG. Melatonin and SaMT levels at baseline were measured in serum and first-void morning urine samples, respectively.  Results:   Based on changes in the QLQC30 insomnia subscale, 28 (55%) patients experienced sleep quality deterioration (deterioration group). Urine SaMT values in the deterioration group were lower than those in the non-deterioration group (P = 0.0015; 7.5 vs 15.4 ng/mg creatinine, respectively). Nocturia scores in the non-deterioration group decreased over time, while those of the deterioration group remained high after completion of iBCG. A binary logistic regression analysis revealed that low urine SaMT levels (≤ 9.6 ng/mg creatinine), high IPSS nocturia scores at baseline, and high IPSS storage subscores at baseline were associated with BCG-induced sleep quality deterioration.

Detection of nuclear RAD51 foci in tumor cells is a marker of HRR functionality, and we previously established a test to detect RAD51 nuclear foci. Here, we aimed to validate the RAD51 score cut off and compare the performance of this test to other HRR deficiency (HRD) detection methods. Laboratory models from BRCA1/BRCA2-associated breast cancer, HGSOC, and PaC were developed and evaluated for their response to PARPi and cisplatin. HRD in these models and patient samples was evaluated by DNA sequencing of HRR genes, genomic HRD tests, and RAD51 foci detection. We established patient-derived xenograft models from breast cancer (n = 103), HGSOC (n = 4), and PaC (n = 2) that recapitulated patient HRD status and treatment response. The RAD51 test showed higher accuracy than HRR gene mutations and genomic HRD analysis for predicting PARPi response (95%, 67%, and 71%, respectively). RAD51 detection captured dynamic changes in HRR status upon acquisition of PARPi resistance. The accuracy of the RAD51 test was similar to HRR gene mutations for predicting platinum response. The predefined RAD51 score cut off was validated, and the high predictive value of the RAD51 test in preclinical models was confirmed. These results collectively support pursuing clinical assessment of the RAD51 test in patient samples from randomized trials testing PARPi or platinum-based therapies.

However, the physiological function of Par-4 remains unknown. Here we show that conventional Par-4 knockout (Par-4-/-) mice and adipocyte-specific Par-4 knockout (AKO) mice, but not hepatocyte-specific Par-4 knockout mice, are obese with standard chow diet. Par-4-/- and AKO mice exhibit increased absorption and storage of fat in adipocytes. Mechanistically, Par-4 loss is associated with mdm2 downregulation and activation of p53. We identified complement factor c3 as a p53-regulated gene linked to fat storage in adipocytes. Par-4 re-expression in adipocytes or c3 deletion reversed the obese mouse phenotype. Moreover, obese human subjects showed lower expression of Par-4 relative to lean subjects, and in longitudinal studies, low baseline Par-4 levels denoted an increased risk of developing obesity later in life.

The new trend nowadays is to exploit natural products with the hope of developing new anticancer agents with fewer side effects. Propolis is one of these natural products which showed effectiveness in cancer treatment. The aim of this study is to understand the multi-level mechanism of action of propolis constituents in cancer treatment using an integrated approach of network pharmacology-based analysis, molecular docking and in vitro cytotoxicity testing. An inhouse database of chemical constituents from Egyptian propolis was compiled and assessed for its ADME properties using the QikProp module in the Schrodinger software. STITCH, UniProt, STRING, KEGG and DAVID databases were used for construction of constituent-target gene, gene-pathway, and constituent-target gene-pathway networks with the aid of Cytoscape 3.8.2. The network pharmacology-based analysis showed that the hit propolis constituents related to cancer targets were genistein, luteolin, benzoic acid, quercetin and vanillic acid, whereas the main cancer-associated targets were CYP1A1, CYP19A1, ESR1, NOS3, CASP3 and AKT1. Twenty-four cancer-related pathways were recognized where the most enriched ones were pathways in cancer and estrogen signaling pathway. The most enriched biological processes involved in the mechanism of action of propolis constituents in cancer treatment were negative regulation of the apoptotic process and the metabolic process and negative regulation of cellular glucuronidation. Molecular docking analysis of the top hit compounds against the most enriched target proteins in the constructed networks was carried out using the Maestro interface of the Schrodinger software. Among hit compounds, quercetin and genistein exhibited the most stabilized interaction. Finally, confirmation of the potential anticancer activity of propolis was assured by in vitro cytotoxicity testing of propolis extract on human prostate cancer (DU-145), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) and colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell lines. This study presents deeper insights about propolis molecular mechanisms of action in cancer for the first time using an integrated approach of network pharmacology, molecular docking and in vitro testing.""","""['Reham S Ibrahim', 'Alaa A El-Banna']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""RSC Adv""","""['Prediction of potential cancer-related molecular targets of North African plants constituents using network pharmacology-based analysis.', 'Identifying cancer-related molecular targets of Nandina domestica Thunb. by network pharmacology-based analysis in combination with chemical profiling and molecular docking studies.', ""Identification of phytochemicals from North African plants for treating Alzheimer's diseases and of their molecular targets by in silico network pharmacology approach."", 'Exploration of the mechanism of Zisheng Shenqi decoction against gout arthritis using network pharmacology.', 'An Insight into Anticancer Effect of Propolis and Its Constituents: A Review of Molecular Mechanisms.', 'Forecasting of potential anti-inflammatory targets of some immunomodulatory plants and their constituents using in vitro, molecular docking and network pharmacology-based analysis.', 'Metabolic profiling of Lantana camara L. using UPLC-MS/MS and revealing its inflammation-related targets using network pharmacology-based and molecular docking analyses.', 'The Potential Use of Propolis as an Adjunctive Therapy in Breast Cancers.', 'Molecular Research on Oral Diseases and Related Biomaterials: A Journey from Oral Cell Models to Advanced Regenerative Perspectives.']"""

Methods: This was an international multicenter, retrospective study. One hundred twenty-four men with metastatic castration-specific prostate cancer (mCRPC) who underwent 177Lu-PSMA therapy and received PSMA PET/CT at baseline and at an interim time point of 12 wk were included. Pairs of baseline interim PET/CT scans were interpreted by consensus among 3 masked readers for appearance of new lesions. Tumor lesions were segmented, and total PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-VOL) was obtained. Appearance of new lesions and changes in PSMA-VOL were combined to develop RECIP 1.0, which included classifications of complete response (RECIP-CR: absence of any PSMA-ligand uptake on interim PET/CT), partial response (RECIP-PR: decline ≥ 30% in PSMA-VOL and no appearance of new lesions), progressive disease (RECIP-PD: increase ≥ 20% in PSMA-VOL and appearance of new lesions), and stable disease (RECIP-SD: any condition but RECIP-PR or RECIP-PD). Changes in PSA levels at 12 wk by Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 were recorded. PSA + RECIP results were defined as response (PSA decline ≥ 50% or RECIP-PR/CR) or progression (PSA increase ≥ 25% or RECIP-PD). The study's primary outcome measure was the prognostic value of RECIP 1.0 for overall survival (OS). The secondary outcome measure was the prognostic accuracy (C-index) of PSA + RECIP versus PSA responses. Results: Patients with RECIP-PD (n = 39; 8.3 mo) had a shorter OS than patients with stable disease (RECIP-SD) (n = 47; 13.1 mo; P < 0.001) or RECIP-PR (n = 38; 21.7 mo; P < 0.001). In identifying responders and progressors, PSA + RECIP had C-indices superior to those of PSA only: 0.65 versus 0.62 (P = 0.028) and 0.66 versus 0.63 (P = 0.044), respectively. Conclusion: PSMA PET/CT by RECIP 1.0 is prognostic for OS and can be used as a response biomarker to monitor early efficacy of 177Lu-PSMA in men with mCRPC.

Methods:   The investigation was performed using 57 retrospective, interstitial prostate treatments randomly assigned to training (n = 27), validation (n = 10), and testing (n = 20). Unique to this work, the CT image set was reformatted into 2D sagittal slices instead of the default axial orientation. A deep learning-based segmentation was performed using a 2D U-Net architecture followed by a density-based linkage clustering algorithm to classify individual catheters in 3D. Potential confounders, such as gold seeds and conjoined applicators with intersecting needle geometries, were corrected using a customized polynomial fitting algorithm. The geometric agreement of the automated digitization was evaluated against the clinically treated manual digitization to measure tip and shaft errors in the reconstruction.  Results:   The proposed algorithm achieved tip and shaft agreements of -0.1 ± 0.6 mm (range -1.8 mm to 1.4 mm) and 0.13 ± 0.09 mm (maximum 0.96 mm), respectively on a data set with 20 patients and 353 total needles. Our method was able to separate all intersecting applicators reliably. The time to generate the automated applicator digitization averaged approximately 1 min.  Conclusions:   Using sagittal instead of axial images for 2D segmentation of interstitial brachytherapy applicators produced submillimeter agreement with manual segmentation.

Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) is identified to be the most common biomarker for the prediction of immunotherapy. But it is still unclear about the relationship of gene mutations in PCa with TMB and immune response.  Objectives:   To study the relationship between gene mutation and anti-tumor immune response in the prostate cancer tumor microenvironment.  Methods:   In the present work, the PCa somatic mutation data were collected from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets.  Results:   As a result, 8 genes with high mutation frequency, including TP53, PTEN, TTN, FLG, CTNNB1, SPOP, MUC16, and KMT2C, were discovered to be covered by 4 cohorts from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and China. Overall, the FLG mutation was related to a greater TMB, which predicted the dismal prognostic outcome. Besides, the CIBERSORT algorithm and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were adopted for analysis, which revealed that FLG mutation remarkably promoted immune response in the context of PCa and accelerated cancer development. To sum up, FLG shows a high mutation frequency in PCa, and is related to the increase in TMB, up-regulation of abnormal immune responses in tumors, and promotion of tumor progression.  Conclusion:   Therefore, it may be used as a biomarker to predict the abnormal immune responses and provide a therapeutic target for immunotherapy in the treatment of PCa.""","""['Peng Zhang', 'Zesheng An', 'Changhai Sun', 'Yong Xu', 'Zhihong Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Biotechnol""","""['Bioinformatic Analysis of Immune Significance of RYR2 Mutation in Breast Cancer.', 'EP300 mutation is associated with tumor mutation burden and promotes antitumor immunity in bladder cancer patients.', 'Titin Mutation Is Associated With Tumor Mutation Burden and Promotes Antitumor Immunity in Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'The Role of Somatic Mutations on the Immune Response of the Tumor Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer.', 'Immune related biomarkers for cancer metastasis to the brain.', 'Clinical and genetic characteristics in pancreatic cancer from Chinese patients revealed by whole exome sequencing.', 'JAG1 is correlated to suppressive immune microenvironment and predicts immunotherapy resistance in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Analysis of prognostic oncogene filaggrin (FLG) wild-type subtype and its implications for immune checkpoint blockade therapy in bladder urothelial carcinoma.', 'Large-Scale Transcriptome Data Analysis Identifies KIF2C as a Potential Therapeutic Target Associated With Immune Infiltration in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   In December 1994, 20,000 men born 1930-1944 were randomly extracted from the Swedish population register and were randomized (1:1) into either a screening group (SG) or to a control group (CG). Men in the SG were repeatedly invited for biennial prostate specific antigen testing up to an average age of 69 years. Main endpoints were PC incidence and mortality (intention-to-screen principle).  Results:   After 22 years, 1,528 men in the SG and 1,124 men in the CG had been diagnosed with PC. In total, 112 PC deaths occurred in the SG and 158 in the CG.

The purpose of this study was to retrospectively analyze the incremental diagnostic value of 18F-DCFPyL dual-time imaging in patients with prostate cancer.  Method:   114 prostate-related malignant lesions and 43 benign lesions in 38 patients with prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) for benign and prostate-related malignant lesions were calculated at min 60 and min 120 of PET/CT imaging. In order to calculate SUV ratio, the SUVmax of left gluteus maximus was measured at the same time. The difference of SUVmax metrics and SUV ratio between malignant and benign lesions was statistically analyzed, the cut-off value of ROC curve was calculated, and the diagnostic efficacy of SUVmax index and SUV ratio at two time points was compared.  Results:   SUVmax metrics and SUV ratio of early and delayed imaging of PC-related malignant lesions were significantly higher than those of benign lesions (p < 0.05). In terms of individual indicators, the highest accuracy and sensitivity was in the delayed SUV ratio (89.2% and 94.7%), the best specificity was in the early SUVmax (93.0%). When the individual and combined indicators were compared together, the SUV ratio in the delay period still showed the best diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, and the best specificity were SUVmax early and ▵SUVmax, SUVmax early and RI.  Conclusions:   Uptake of 18F-DCFPyL increased over time in prostate-associated malignant lesions compared with benign tissue.

In low-risk localised prostate cancer radical prostatectomy was conducted more often in week 9-12 (21% versus 12% in the reference period; OR=1.9, 95% CI; 1.2-3.1) and less active surveillance was applied (67% versus 78%; OR=0.6, 95% CI; 0.4-0.9). In the intermediate-risk group, a similar change was observed in week 13-16. Radical prostatectomy volumes in 2020 were comparable to 2018-2019.  Conclusion:   During the first COVID-19 wave the number of prostate cancer diagnoses declined. In the second half of 2020 this largely restored although the number remained lower than expected. Changes in treatment were temporary and compliant with adapted guidelines. Although delayed diagnoses could result in a less favourable stage distribution, possibly affecting survival, this seems not very likely.""","""['Désirée van Deukeren', 'Berdine L Heesterman', 'Lianne Roelofs', 'Lambertus A Kiemeney', 'J Alfred Witjes', 'Tineke J Smilde', 'Geert J L H van Leenders', 'Luca Incrocci', 'Ben G L Vanneste', 'Richard P Meijer', 'Sabine Siesling', 'Bart P J van Bezooijen', 'Katja K H Aben;COVID and Cancer-NL consortium']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Treat Res Commun""","""['Management of patients who opt for radical prostatectomy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: an international accelerated consensus statement.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'The impact of the temporary suspension of national cancer screening programmes due to the COVID-19 epidemic on the diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancer in the Netherlands.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, stage, and treatment of esophagogastric cancer.', 'Population-based impact of COVID-19 on incidence, treatment, and survival of patients with pancreatic cancer.', 'Whole-population trends in pathology-confirmed cancer incidence in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: A retrospective observational study.', 'The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on urologic cancer care: did we throw the baby out with the bathwater?', 'How has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced prostate cancer?-a tertiary single-centre analysis of oncological results, diagnosis and treatment times.']"""

The concrete mechanism by which autophagy modulates the efficacy of radiotherapy for prostate cancer (PC) remains unclear. We exposed RM-1 PC cells to X-ray and explored the role of autophagy in radiation injury. Our results showed increased apoptosis and autophagy levels in RM-1 cells after radiation. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine significantly mitigated radiation-induced apoptosis, while the enhancement of autophagy by rapamycin aggravated apoptosis. Sirt1, a member of sirtuin family, deacetylates various transcription factors to trigger cell survival in response to radiation injury. We found that radiation led to Sirt1 downregulation, which was reversed by the inhibition of autophagy. On the contrary, enhanced autophagy further diminished protein level of Sirt1. Notably, overexpression of Sirt1 by plasmid significantly alleviated radiation-induced apoptosis, but silenced Sirt1 by siRNA further induced apoptosis, indicating the radioprotective effect of Sirt1 on RM-1 cells. In summary, our findings suggested that autophagy-mediated Sirt1 downregulation might be a promising therapeutic target for PC.""","""['Kai-Xuan Wang', 'Chen Yan', 'Xu Yang', 'Pei-Yan Zhu', 'Wen-Wen Cui', 'Cong Ye', 'Kan Hu', 'Ting Lan', 'Lin-Yan Huang', 'Wan Wang', 'Ping Ma', 'Su-Hua Qi', 'Bing Gu', 'Lan Luo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Resveratrol protects intestinal epithelial cells against radiation-induced damage by promoting autophagy and inhibiting apoptosis through SIRT1 activation.', 'miR-22 suppresses tumorigenesis and improves radiosensitivity of breast cancer cells by targeting Sirt1.', 'Disruption of a Sirt1-dependent autophagy checkpoint in the prostate results in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia lesion formation.', 'Protective Effect of Sirt1 against Radiation-Induced Damage.', 'SIRT1 and microRNAs: The role in breast, lung and prostate cancers.', 'SIRT1 mediated gastric cancer progression under glucose deprivation through the FoxO1-Rab7-autophagy axis.']"""

Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.In primary analysis, enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC); however, overall survival data were immature. In the phase III, double-blind, global ARCHES trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02677896), 1,150 patients with mHSPC were randomly assigned 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg once daily) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT, stratified by disease volume and prior docetaxel use. Here, we report the final prespecified analysis of overall survival (key secondary end point) and an update on rPFS, other secondary end points, and safety. After unblinding, 180 (31.3%) progression-free patients randomly assigned to placebo plus ADT crossed over to open-label enzalutamide plus ADT. As of May 28, 2021 (median follow-up, 44.6 months), 154 of 574 patients randomly assigned to enzalutamide plus ADT and 202 of 576 patients randomly assigned to placebo plus ADT had died.

Although hypofractionated radiotherapy may benefit health care systems and the global community while decreasing treatment burden for patients traveling for daily radiotherapy, it has not been studied prospectively nor in randomized trials for treatment of uterine cancers, and the associated toxic effects and patient quality of life are unknown.  Objective:   To evaluate acute genitourinary and bowel toxic effects and patient-reported outcomes following stereotactic hypofractionated adjuvant radiation to the pelvis for treatment of uterine cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Stereotactic Pelvic Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in Cancers of the Uterus (SPARTACUS) phase 1/2 nonrandomized controlled trial of patients accrued between May 2019 and August 2021 was conducted as a multicenter trial at 2 cancer centers in Ontario, Canada. In total, 61 patients with uterine cancer stages I through III after surgery entered the study.  Interventions:   Stereotactic adjuvant pelvic radiation to a dose of 30 Gy in 5 fractions administered every other day or once weekly.  Main outcomes and measures:   Assessments of toxic effects and patient-reported quality of life (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaires C30 and endometrial EN24) were collected at baseline, fractions 3 and 5, and at 6 weeks and 3 months of follow-up. Descriptive analysis was conducted, calculating means, SDs, medians, IQRs, and ranges for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Univariate generalized linear mixed models were generated for repeated measurements on the quality-of-life scales.  Results:   A total of 61 patients were enrolled (median age, 66 years; range, 51-88 years). Tumor histologic results included 39 endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 15 serous or clear cell, 3 carcinosarcoma, and 4 dedifferentiated. Sixteen patients received sequential chemotherapy, and 9 received additional vault brachytherapy. Median follow-up was 9 months (IQR, 3-15 months). Of 61 patients, worst acute gastrointestinal tract toxic effects of grade 1 were observed in 33 patients (54%) and of grade 2 in 8 patients (13%). For genitourinary worst toxic effects, grade 1 was observed in 25 patients (41%) and grade 2 in 2 patients (3%). One patient (1.6%) had an acute grade 3 gastrointestinal tract toxic effect of diarrhea at fraction 5 that resolved at follow-up. Only patient-reported diarrhea scores were both clinically (scores ≥10) and statistically significantly worse at fraction 5 (mean [SD] score, 35.76 [26.34]) compared with baseline (mean [SD] score, 6.56 [13.36]; P < .001), but this symptom improved at follow-up.  Conclusions and relevance:   Results of this phase 1/2 nonrandomized controlled trial suggest that stereotactic hypofractionated radiation was well tolerated at short-term follow-up for treatment of uterine cancer.

Objective:   To evaluate the association of BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants with additional cancer types and their clinical characteristics in 100 914 individuals across 14 cancer types.  Design, setting, and participants:   This case-control analysis to identify cancer types and clinical characteristics associated with pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 included DNA samples and clinical information from 63 828 patients with 14 common cancer types and 37 086 controls that were sourced from a multi-institutional hospital-based registry, BioBank Japan, between April 2003 and March 2018. The data were analyzed between August 2019 and October 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Germline pathogenic variants in coding regions and 2 bp flanking intronic sequences in BRCA1 and BRCA2 were identified by a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based target sequence method. Associations of (likely) pathogenic variants with each cancer type were assessed by comparing pathogenic variant carrier frequency between patients in each cancer type and controls.

This study aims to investigate the screening, diagnosis, and mortality rates of the top five leading causes of cancer mortality in the United States from 2019 to 2021 to determine the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cancer care.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on screening, diagnoses, and mortality rates of the top five leading causes of cancer death (lung/bronchus, colon/rectum, pancreas, breast, and prostate), as determined by the National Institute of Health (NIH) utilizing The United States Healthcare Cost Institute and American Cancer Society databases from 2019 to 2021.  Results:   Screenings decreased by 24.98% for colorectal cancer and 16.01% for breast cancer from 2019 to 2020. Compared to 2019, there was a .29% increase in lung/bronchus, 19.72% increase in colorectal, 1.46% increase in pancreatic, 2.89% increase in breast, and 144.50% increase in prostate cancer diagnoses in 2020 (all P < .01). There was an increase in the total number of deaths from colorectal, pancreatic, breast, and prostate cancers from 2019 to 2021.  Conclusion:   There was a decrease in the screening rates for breast and colorectal cancer, along with an increase in the estimated incidence and mortality rate among the five leading causes of cancer deaths from 2019 to 2021.

Materials and methods:   This study included a retrospective multi-center dataset of 524 PCa lesions (of which 204 are CS PCa) on bpMRI. All lesions were both semi-automatically segmented with a DLM auto-fixed VOI method (averaging < 10 s per lesion) and manually segmented by an expert uroradiologist (averaging 5 min per lesion). The DLM auto-fixed VOI method uses a spherical VOI (with its center at the location of the lowest apparent diffusion coefficient of the prostate lesion as indicated with a single mouse click) from which non-prostate voxels are removed using a deep learning-based prostate segmentation algorithm. Thirteen different DLM auto-fixed VOI diameters (ranging from 6 to 30 mm) were explored. Extracted radiomics data were split into training and test sets (4:1 ratio). Performance was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.  Results:   In the test set, the area under the ROC curve (AUCs) of the DLM auto-fixed VOI method with a VOI diameter of 18 mm (0.76 [95% CI: 0.66-0.85]) was significantly higher (p = 0.0198) than that of the manual segmentation method (0.62 [95% CI: 0.52-0.73]).  Conclusions:   A DLM auto-fixed VOI segmentation can provide a potentially more accurate radiomics diagnosis of CS PCa than expert manual segmentation while also reducing expert time investment by more than 97%.  Key points:   • Compared to traditional expert-based segmentation, a deep learning mask (DLM) auto-fixed VOI placement is more accurate at detecting CS PCa. • Compared to traditional expert-based segmentation, a DLM auto-fixed VOI placement is faster and can result in a 97% time reduction. • Applying deep learning to an auto-fixed VOI radiomics approach can be valuable.""","""['Jeroen Bleker', 'Thomas C Kwee', 'Dennis Rouw', 'Christian Roest', 'Jaap Borstlap', 'Igle Jan de Jong', 'Rudi A J O Dierckx', 'Henkjan Huisman', 'Derya Yakar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multiparametric MRI and auto-fixed volume of interest-based radiomics signature for clinically significant peripheral zone prostate cancer.', 'Radiomics Models Based on Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Maps for the Prediction of High-Grade Prostate Cancer at Radical Prostatectomy: Comparison With Preoperative Biopsy.', 'Detection of Prostate Cancer Using Biparametric Prostate MRI, Radiomics, and Kallikreins: A Retrospective Multicenter Study of Men With a Clinical Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Deep learning-based artificial intelligence applications in prostate MRI: brief summary.', 'Normalization Strategies in Multi-Center Radiomics Abdominal MRI: Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses.', 'Radiomics-based approaches outperform visual analysis for differentiating lipoma from atypical lipomatous tumors: a review.', 'Artificial intelligence performance in image-based ovarian cancer identification: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Matriptase-2 (MT-2) is a membrane-anchored serine protease which can suppress prostate cancer (PCa) cell invasion. In this study, we showed that MT-2 was down-regulated in PCa and could suppress PCa cell motility, tumor growth, and metastasis. Using microarray and biochemical analysis, we found that MT-2 shifted TGF-β action towards its tumor suppressor function by repressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promoting Smad2 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation to upregulate two TGF-β1 downstream effectors (p21 and PAI-1), culminating in hindrance of PCa cell motility and malignant growth. Mechanistically, MT-2 could dramatically up-regulate the expression of nuclear receptor NR4A3 via iron metabolism in PCa cells. MT-2-induced NR4A3 further coactivated Smad2 to activate p21 and PAI-1 expression.

KIF20A, a kinesin with unique structural features, is overexpressed in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to androgen-dependent PC and benign tissue. KIF20A has well-described roles in mitotic processes, but it has a less characterized function in vesicle fission and trafficking within Golgi-driven secretory pathways. Stable expression of KIF20A in androgen-dependent PC cells promoted progression to CRPC through the activation of AR signaling in vitro and in vivo. KIF20A expression resulted in the secretion of autocrine factors in the conditioned media that activated AR and caused castration-resistant proliferation of naïve androgen-dependent cells. Pharmacologic disruption of vesicle biogenesis blocked KIF20A-driven castration-resistant proliferation of androgen-dependent PC. KIF20A depletion or treatment with the KIF20A-specific inhibitor, paprotrain, reduced CRPC.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is widely used as a treatment option for all disease stages. ADT, and the resulting decline in androgen levels, may indirectly affect gut microbiota. Factors affecting gut microbiota are wide-ranging; however, literature is scarce on the effects of ADT on gut microbiota and metabolome profiles in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   To study the changes of gut microbiome by ADT, this 24-week observational study investigated the relationship between testosterone levels and changes in gut microbiota in Japanese patients with prostate cancer undergoing ADT. Sequential faecal samples were collected 1 and 2 weeks before ADT, and 1, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after ADT. Blood samples were collected at almost the same times. Bacterial 16 S rRNA gene-based microbiome analyses and capillary electrophoresis-time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolome analyses were performed.  Results:   In total, 23 patients completed the study. The α- and ß-diversity of gut microbiota decreased significantly at 24 weeks after ADT (p = 0.017, p < 0.001, respectively). Relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Pseudomonadales, Pseudomonas, and concentrations of urea, lactate, butyrate, 2-hydroxyisobutyrate and S-adenosylmethionine changed significantly after ADT (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of Proteobacteria, a known indicator of dysbiosis, and the concentration of lactate (R = 0.49, p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   The decline in testosterone levels resulted in detrimental changes in gut microbiota. This dysbiosis may contribute to an increase in frailty and an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Akimasa Kure', 'Tomoya Tsukimi', 'Chiharu Ishii', 'Wanping Aw', 'Nozomu Obana', 'Gaku Nakato', 'Akiyoshi Hirayama', 'Haruna Kawano', 'Toshiyuki China', 'Fumitaka Shimizu', 'Masayoshi Nagata', 'Shinji Isotani', 'Satoru Muto', 'Shigeo Horie', 'Shinji Fukuda']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Does exercise impact gut microbiota composition in men receiving androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer?

Methodology:   A population-based multicase-control (MCC-Spain) study was conducted. Information was collected on sociodemographic characteristics, personal and family antecedents, and lifestyles, including diet from a Food Frequency Questionnaire. The inflammatory potential of the diet was assessed using the energy-adjusted Dietary Inflammatory Index (E-DII) based on 30 parameters (a higher score indicates a higher inflammatory capacity of the diet). Tertiles of E-DII were created using the cut-off points from the control group. The International Society of Urology Pathology (ISUP) was grouped as ISUP 1, ISUP 2, or ISUP 3-5. Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between E-DII score and PCa risk.  Results:   A total of 928 PCa cases and 1278 population controls were included. Among PCa cases, the mean value of the E-DII score was 0.18 (SD: 1.9) vs. 0.07 (SD: 1.9) in the control group (p = 0.162).

The products, 2-benzimidazol-diphenyl-2-imino-thiazolidine-4-ols, are purely hemiaminals. They have a tendency to decompose at a high rate. The solid-phase reactive chromatographic technique has been applied to avoid extensive liquid-liquid extraction and stabilised the product by precipitation in solvents. Benzimidazole phenyl thiourea and phenacyl bromide have been used as starting materials in this study. Both the starting materials are adsorbed on dry silica and packed in a glass column with a systematic arrangement of layers. A directly solid product was precipitated in cold hexane. Anticancer activities have been recorded against four cell lines, human colon, prostate, lung and breast cancer, with reference to doxorubicin as a standard. These compounds show a promising effect on human lung cancer, products B9 (IC50 = 3.890 μM) and B10 (IC50 = 2.798 μM) and B13 (IC50 = 3.140 μM) which very close to doxorubicine (IC50 = 1.750 μM). It was observed that fluoro phenyl functionalities are effective compared to trifluoro methyl phenyl functionalities for anticancer activities.

Interventional research involves in-person assessment of physical fitness/activity and cognitive function, which has been negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Androgen deprivation therapy-related hot flashes and nocturia increase risk for insomnia. Insomnia is associated with fatigue and may exacerbate ADT-related cognitive changes.  Objectives:   The purpose of this mixed-methods pilot was to (1) determine feasibility/acceptability of remotely assessing physical fitness/activity, cognitive function, and sleep; (2) deliver telehealth cognitive behavioral training for insomnia (teleCBT-I) to improve sleep; and (3) garner qualitative feedback to refine remote procedures and teleCBT-I content.  Methods:   Fifteen men with PC receiving ADT completed a 4-week teleCBT-I intervention. Videoconferencing was used to complete study assessments and deliver the weekly teleCBT-I intervention.  Results:   Self-report of sleep quality improved ( P < .001) as did hot flash frequency ( P = .04) and bother ( P = .025). Minimal clinically important differences were detected for changes in insomnia severity and sleep quality. All sleep logs indicated improvement in sleep efficiency. Remote assessment of fitness/cognitive function was demonstrated for 100% of participants. Sufficient actigraph wear time allowed physical activity/sleep assessment for 80%. Sleep actigraphy did not demonstrate significant changes.  Conclusions:   Remote monitoring and teleCBT-I are feasible/acceptable to men with PC on ADT. Further research to confirm teleCBT-I efficacy is warranted in this population.  Implications for practice:   Preliminary efficacy for teleCBT-I interventions was demonstrated.

These efforts to identify molecules that incorporate piperazate building blocks resulted in the discovery and structural elucidation of two dimeric biaryl-cyclohexapeptides, petrichorins A and B. Petrichorin B is a symmetric homodimer similar to the known compound chloptosin, but petrichorin A is unique among known piperazyl cyclopeptides because it is an asymmetric heterodimer. Due to the structural complexity of petrichorin A, solving its structure required a combination of several standard chemical methods plus in silico modeling, strain mutagenesis, and solving the structure of its biosynthetic intermediate petrichorin C for confident assignment. Furthermore, we found that the piperazyl cyclopeptides comprising each half of the petrichorin A heterodimer are made via two distinct nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) assembly lines, and the responsible NRPS enzymes are encoded within a contiguous biosynthetic supercluster on the L. flaviverrucosa chromosome. Requiring promiscuous cytochrome p450 crosslinking events for asymmetric and symmetric biaryl production, petrichorins A and B exhibited potent in vitro activity against A2780 human ovarian cancer, HT1080 fibrosarcoma, PC3 human prostate cancer, and Jurkat human T lymphocyte cell lines with IC50 values at low nM levels.

Antiandrogen therapies reduce expression of TMPRSS2.  Objective:   To determine if temporary androgen suppression induced by degarelix improves clinical outcomes of inpatients hospitalized with COVID-19.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Hormonal Intervention for the Treatment in Veterans With COVID-19 Requiring Hospitalization (HITCH) phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial compared efficacy of degarelix plus standard care vs placebo plus standard care on clinical outcomes in men hospitalized with COVID-19 but not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Inpatients were enrolled at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals from July 22, 2020, to April 8, 2021. Data were analyzed from August 9 to October 15, 2021.  Interventions:   Patients stratified by age, history of hypertension, and disease severity were centrally randomized 2:1 to degarelix, (1-time subcutaneous dose of 240 mg) or a saline placebo. Standard care included but was not limited to supplemental oxygen, antibiotics, vasopressor support, peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis, intravenous fluids, remdesivir, convalescent plasma, and dexamethasone.  Main outcomes and measures:   The composite primary end point was mortality, ongoing need for hospitalization, or requirement for mechanical ventilation at day 15 after randomization. Secondary end points were time to clinical improvement, inpatient mortality, length of hospitalization, duration of mechanical ventilation, time to achieve a temperature within reference range, maximum severity of COVID-19, and the composite end point at 30 days.  Results:   The trial was stopped for futility after the planned interim analysis, at which time there were 96 evaluable patients, including 62 patients randomized to the degarelix group and 34 patients in the placebo group, out of 198 initially planned. The median (range) age was 70.5 (48-85) years. Common comorbidities included chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (15 patients [15.6%]), hypertension (75 patients [78.1%]), cardiovascular disease (27 patients [28.1%]), asthma (12 patients [12.5%]), diabetes (49 patients [51.0%]), and chronic respiratory failure requiring supplemental oxygen at baseline prior to COVID-19 (9 patients [9.4%]). For the primary end point, there was no significant difference between the degarelix and placebo groups (19 patients [30.6%] vs 9 patients [26.5%]; P = .67). Similarly, no differences were observed between degarelix and placebo groups in any secondary end points, including inpatient mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 6 patients [17.6%]) or all-cause mortality (11 patients [17.7%] vs 7 patents [20.6%]). There were no differences between degarelix and placebo groups in the overall rates of adverse events (13 patients [21.0%] vs 8 patients [23.5%) and serious adverse events (19 patients [30.6%] vs 13 patients [32.4%]), nor unexpected safety concerns.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial of androgen suppression vs placebo and usual care for men hospitalized with COVID-19, degarelix did not result in amelioration of COVID-19 severity.

Accumulating evidence implicates SQSTM1 dysregulation in the induction of multiple oncogenic transformations in vivo. SPOP (speckle type BTB/POZ protein), an E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor, is the most frequently mutated gene in prostate cancer (Pca), but the molecular mechanisms underlying how SPOP mutations contribute to PCa tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. In a recent study, we describe a new role for SPOP as a negative regulator of autophagy and NFE2L2 pathway activation. SPOP binds and induces the non-degradative ubiquitination of SQSTM1 at Lys420. This post-translational modification decreases SQSTM1 body formation, liquid phase condensation, dimerization, and ubiquitin-binding capacity, thereby suppressing SQSTM1-dependent autophagy, KEAP1 sequestration, and NFE2L2 activation. Notably, PCa-associated SPOP mutants lose the capacity to ubiquitinate SQSTM1 and instead enhance autophagy and the antioxidant response in a dominant-negative manner. Thus, our findings indicate the critical roles of autophagy and NFE2L2 pathway activation in PCa tumorigenesis by oncogenic SPOP mutations.""","""['Kun Gao', 'Qing Shi', 'Yajuan Liu', 'Chenji Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['SPOP mutations promote p62/SQSTM1-dependent autophagy and Nrf2 activation in prostate cancer.', 'SPOP mutations promote p62/SQSTM1-dependent autophagy and Nrf2 activation in prostate cancer.', 'Negative Regulation of the Keap1-Nrf2 Pathway by a p62/Sqstm1 Splicing Variant.', 'ALS-FTLD-linked mutations of SQSTM1/p62 disrupt selective autophagy and NFE2L2/NRF2 anti-oxidative stress pathway.', 'Histone H3F3/H3.3 chaperone DAXX converts to modulate SQSTM1 phase condensation for NFE2L2 activation.', 'Sequestered SQSTM1/p62 crosstalk with Keap1/NRF2 axis in hPDLCs promotes oxidative stress injury induced by periodontitis.', 'Identification and validation of cuproptosis related genes and signature markers in bronchopulmonary dysplasia disease using bioinformatics analysis and machine learning.', 'Metabolic syndrome-related prognostic index: Predicting biochemical recurrence and differentiating between cold and hot tumors in prostate cancer.', 'Histone lysine methylation patterns in prostate cancer microenvironment infiltration: Integrated bioinformatic analysis and histological validation.', 'Comprehensive analysis of TP53 and SPOP mutations and their impact on survival in metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

This study aimed to determine the effect of sedation anesthesia with intravenous (IV) propofol on TRUS-guided prostate biopsy outcomes.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis of 2,119 patients who underwent TRUS-guided prostate biopsy between November 2009 and February 2019 was undertaken. The patients were divided into two groups: patients who underwent sedation anesthesia with IV propofol and patients who underwent local anesthesia with intrarectal lidocaine gel instillation. Cancer detection and complication rates were compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of sedation anesthesia with IV propofol on prostate cancer detection and complication rates.  Results:   The cancer detection rate of patients in the sedation group was 34.0%, whereas it was 29.2% in the local group (P = 0.024). Multivariate logistic regression analysis regarding factors associated with cancer detection rate after TRUS-guided prostate biopsy in patients with prostate specific antigen (PSA) < 10 showed that IV propofol usage, age, PSA density and core length were significant factors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis regarding factors associated with complications (voiding dysfunction, bleeding and infection) showed that IV propofol usage, age and prostate size were significant factors for voiding dysfunction.  Conclusion:   Sedation anesthesia with IV propofol during TRUS-guided prostate biopsy was associated with a higher cancer detection rate than local anesthesia with intrarectal lidocaine gel instillation.

Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate APP and HPP at predicting AP with other clinical variables such as Age, PSA at surgery, Race, Biopsy GGG, mpMRI ECE and mpMRI SVI. Internal and External Validation demonstrated predicted probabilities versus observed probabilities.  Results:   AP was reported in 44.5% (n = 248) of patients.

Genomic studies including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) have reported molecular signatures of prostate cancer, but few studies have assessed the prognostic effects of DNA methylation profiles.  Methods:   We conducted the largest methylome subtyping analysis for primary prostate tumors to date, using methylome data from three patient populations: TCGA, a prostate cancer cohort study conducted at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FH; Seattle, WA), and the Canadian International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) cohort. Four subtypes were detected in the TCGA dataset, then independently assigned to FH and ICGC cohort data. The identified methylation subtypes were assessed for association with cancer prognosis in the above three patient populations.  Results:   Using a set of hypermethylated CpG sites, four methylation subtypes were identified in TCGA. Compared with subtype 1, subtype 4 had an HR of 2.09 (P = 0.029) for biochemical recurrence (BCR) in TCGA patients. HRs of 2.76 (P = 0.002) for recurrence and 9.73 (P = 0.002) for metastatic-lethal (metastasis or prostate cancer-specific death) outcomes were observed in the FH cohort. A similar pattern of association was noted in the Canadian ICGC cohort, though HRs were not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   A hypermethylated subtype was associated with an increased hazard of recurrence and mortality in three studies with prostate tumor methylome data.

Moreover, they could reversely regulate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the activation of MYC. However, the connections between PLK1 and Smad4 have never been studied. Here, we showed that PLK1 could interact with Smad4 and promote the ubiquitination and degradation of Smad4 in PCa cells. PLK1 and PELO could bind to different domains of Smad4 and formed a protein complex. PELO facilitated the degradation of Smad4 through cooperating with PLK1, thereby resulting in proliferation and metastasis of prostate cancer cell. Changes in protein levels of Smad4 led to the alteration of biological function that caused by PLK1 in prostate cancer cells. Further studies showed that PELO upregulation was positively associated with high grade PCa and knockdown of PELO expression significantly decreased PCa cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and vivo. PELO knockdown in PCa cells could enhance the tumor suppressive role of PLK1 inhibitor. In addition, blocking the interaction between PELO and Smad4 by using specific peptide could effectively inhibit PCa cell metastasis ability in vitro and vivo.

Objective:   To determine predictors for grade group (GG) reclassification in patients undergoing an MRI-informed prostate biopsy (MRI-Bx) during AS and to evaluate whether a confirmatory biopsy can be omitted in patients diagnosed with upfront MRI.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Prostate cancer Research International: Active Surveillance (PRIAS) study is a multicenter prospective study of patients on AS (www.prias-project.org). We selected all patients undergoing MRI-Bx (targeted ± systematic biopsy) during AS.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A time-dependent Cox regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of GG progression/reclassification in patients undergoing MRI-Bx. A sensitivity analysis and a multivariable logistic regression analysis were also performed.  Results and limitations:   A total of 1185 patients underwent 1488 MRI-Bx sessions. The time-dependent Cox regression analysis showed that age (per 10 yr, hazard ratio [HR] 0.84 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.71-0.99]), MRI outcome (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PIRADS] 3 vs negative HR 2.46 [95% CI 1.56-3.88], PIRADS 4 vs negative HR 3.39 [95% CI 2.28-5.05], and PIRADS 5 vs negative HR 4.95 [95% CI 3.25-7.56]), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density (per 0.1 ng/ml cm3, HR 1.20 [95% CI 1.12-1.30]), and percentage positive cores on the last systematic biopsy (per 10%, HR 1.16 [95% CI 1.10-1.23]) were significant predictors of GG reclassification. Of the patients with negative MRI and a PSA density of <0.15 ng/ml cm3 (n = 315), 3% were reclassified to GG ≥2 and 0.6% to GG ≥3. At the confirmatory biopsy, reclassification to GG ≥2 and ≥3 was observed in 23% and 7% of the patients diagnosed without upfront MRI and in 19% and 6% of the patients diagnosed with upfront MRI, respectively. The multivariable analysis showed no significant difference in upgrading at the confirmatory biopsy between patients diagnosed with or without upfront MRI.  Conclusions:   Age, MRI outcome, PSA density, and percentage positive cores are significant predictors of reclassification at an MRI-informed biopsy. Patients with negative MRI and a PSA density of <0.15 ng/ml cm3 can safely omit a protocol-based prostate biopsy, whereas in other patients, a multivariable approach is advised. Being diagnosed with upfront MRI appears not to significantly affect reclassification risk; hence, a confirmatory MRI-Bx cannot totally be omitted yet.

However, exercise prescription in practice is limited by concerns regarding skeletal-related events (SREs). This study examined associations among habitual physical activity levels, history of SREs, and patient reported outcomes in patients with bone metastases.  Data sources:   A total of 58 patients with bone metastases (n = 45 breast cancer; n = 13 prostate cancer; mean time since cancer diagnosis 5.8 [4.7] years) were assessed. Habitual physical activity levels were collected by accelerometry. Standardized subjective assessment collected history of SREs, quality of life (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC-BM22), pain (Brief Pain Inventory), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Questionnaire), and perceptions about exercise (Exercise Benefits/Barriers Scale). Participants spent a mean of 77.37% (standard deviation 14.3)% of waking hours sedentary and a mean of 20.14% (standard deviation 13.4)% of waking hours in light intensity activity. Almost half (n = 28) completed ≥150 min/wk moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity were associated with lower pain scores, better perceived physical function, lower functional interference scores, and better quality of life. Patients with a history of fracture since diagnosis spent more time sedentary and in light intensity activity in comparison to those with no fracture history (P < .05).

Thus, we aim to characterize the association between different types of hormone therapy and neurocognitive impairment in a real-world pharmacovigilance database.  Methods:   We queried VigiBase, the World Health Organization's international pharmacovigilance database, for reports of neurocognitive impairment among men who took hormone therapy from 1968 to 2021. We performed disproportionality analysis comparing rates of neurocognitive impairment with different types of hormone therapy versus other VigiBase drugs. Traditional hormonal therapy was defined as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT: gonadotropin-releasing-hormone agonists or antagonists) or first-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonists. Novel AR signaling inhibitors (ARSIs) were defined as ARSIs with or without ADT. Differences were assessed using reporting odds ratio (ROR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and Empirical Bayes Estimator (EBE) values ≥1.0 signifying statistical significance.  Results:   Odds of neurocognitive impairment were significantly elevated with traditional hormone therapy (ROR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34-1.62, EBE = 1.35) and novel ARSIs (ROR 2.40, 95% CI 2.28-2.54, EBE = 2.26). Odds of neurocognitive impairment were significantly elevated with enzalutamide (ROR 2.89, 95% CI 2.73-3.05, EBE = 2.70) and numerically increased with apalutamide (ROR 3.31, 95% CI 1.57-7.00, EBE = 0.98), but were decreased with abiraterone (ROR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55-0.84, EBE = 0.57).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates elevated odds of neurocognitive impairment with hormone therapy in a real-world data set. Neurotoxicity risk was higher with novel ARSIs than traditional agents, and higher with enzalutamide than abiraterone. Due to limitations inherent to disproportionality analysis (measuring associations, not risk) and incomplete data prohibiting the ability to control for factors such as age or use of secondary drugs (e.g., concurrent use of novel ARSIs with ADT), results are exploratory in nature. The amalgamation of these and other conflicting data may contribute to clinical decision-making for men with prostate cancer eligible for treatment with these therapies, especially those with significant neurologic comorbidities.""","""['Logan G Briggs', 'Stephen Reese', 'Peter Herzog', 'David-Dan Nguyen', 'Muhieddine Labban', 'Khalid Alkhatib', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Alicia K Morgans']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Cardiovascular toxicities associated with abiraterone compared to enzalutamide-A pharmacovigilance study.', 'Cardiovascular Events in Men with Prostate Cancer Receiving Hormone Therapy: An Analysis of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS).', 'Androgen Receptor Signaling Inhibitors in Addition to Docetaxel with Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Heart failure and atrial tachyarrhythmia on abiraterone: A pharmacovigilance study.', 'Androgen receptor signaling inhibitors: post-chemotherapy, pre-chemotherapy and now in castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Neurocognitive effects of androgen deprivation therapy and new hormonal agents in a sample of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor pathway inhibitors, prostate cancer, and older adults: a global Young International Society of Geriatric Oncology drug review.']"""

Aberrant expression of six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 2 (STEAP2) has been functionally associated with cancer progression in many cancers. Nevertheless, its biological function in PTC is still unclear. Here, we found that PTC tissues had preferentially downregulated STEAP2 as compared with noncancerous tissues. Low STEAP2 expression correlated with aggressive clinicopathological characteristics and dismal prognosis in patients with PTC. We performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments, including cell proliferation assay (Cell Counting Kit-8 assay), EdU (5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine) and colony formation assays, transwell migration, and invasion assays, and constructed a nude mouse xenograft tumor model. The results demonstrated that STEAP2 overexpression inhibited PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and inhibited lung metastasis and tumorigenicity in vivo. Conversely, silencing STEAP2 yielded the opposite results in vitro. Mechanistically, bioinformatics analysis combined with validation experiments identified STEAP2 as the downstream target of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. METTL3 stabilized STEAP2 mRNA and regulated STEAP2 expression positively in an m6A-dependent manner. We also showed that m6A-mediated STEAP2 mRNA translation initiation relied on a pathway dependent on the m6A reader protein YTHDF1. Rescue experiments revealed that silencing STEAP2 partially rescued the tumor-suppressive phenotype induced by METTL3 overexpression. Lastly, we verified that the METTL3-STEAP2 axis functions as an inhibitor in PTC by suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that METTL3-mediated STEAP2 m6A modification plays a critical tumor-suppressive role in PTC progression. The METTL3-STEAP2 axis may be a potential therapeutic molecular target against PTC.""","""['Yue Zhu#', 'Xinzhi Peng#', 'Qianlei Zhou#', 'Langping Tan', 'Cheng Zhang', 'Shaojian Lin', 'Miaoyun Long']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine modification is critical for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of gastric cancer.', 'The m6A Methyltransferase METTL3-Mediated N6-Methyladenosine Modification of DEK mRNA to Promote Gastric Cancer Cell Growth and Metastasis.', 'Methylation recognition protein YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 1 (YTHDF1) regulates the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma by regulating m6A level of CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7 (CNOT7).', 'The role of RNA methyltransferase METTL3 in gynecologic cancers: Results and mechanisms.', 'Critical Roles of METTL3 in Translation Regulation of Cancer.', 'Methyltransferase-like proteins in cancer biology and potential therapeutic targeting.', 'METTL3/YTHDF2 m6A axis promotes the malignant progression of bladder cancer by epigenetically suppressing RRAS.', 'Roles of RNA Methylations in Cancer Progression, Autophagy, and Anticancer Drug Resistance.', 'The Emerging Role of m6A Modification in Endocrine Cancer.', 'RNA Modifications Meet Tumors.']"""

Methods: A total of 119 patients with prostate diseases [122 regions of interest(ROI)] who underwent routine MRI scan and magnetic resonance image compilation (MAGiC) sequence of prostate from March 2020 to March 2021 in General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University were retrospectively collected, they were divided into prostate cancer group(58 cases, 61 ROI) and non-prostate cancer group(61 cases, 61 ROI) according to the pathological results. In the prostate cancer group, those patients with an age of 48 to 85(69.8±5.9) years, and further divided into two subgroups according to the location of occurrence: peripheral zone cancer group (43 cases, 45 ROI) and transitional zone cancer group (15 cases, 16 ROI). The non-prostate cancer group consisted of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or complicated with chronic prostatitis, with an age of 41 to 81(68.6±7.0) years, and they were further divided into two subgroups according to the location of occurrence: non-cancerous peripheral zone group (45 cases, 45 ROI) and transitional zone benign prostatic hyperplasia group(16 cases, 16 ROI). Prostate cancer lesions were classified as low risk (Gleason score ≤6) or intermediate/high risk (Gleason score ≥7). After the post-processing of MAGiC images, T1, T2 and proton density(PD) values of prostate cancer group and non-prostate cancer group were obtained. At the same time, relevant software were used for image post-processing to generate apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, the data between the two groups were analyzed by the Independent sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test, and the diagnostic effectiveness of each quantitative parameter in diagnosing prostate cancer and discriminating low risk prostate cancer from intermediate/high risk prostate cancer was analyzed by using receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, the correlation between each quantitative parameter and Gleason score were assessed by Spearman correlation analysis. Results: The T1 value and T2 value of the peripheral zone cancer group were lower than those in non-cancerous peripheral zone group [1 201.3 (1 103.5, 1 298.2) ms vs 2 274.0 (1 620.9, 2 776.5) ms; 78.0 (74.0, 83.8) ms vs (160.6±54.9) ms] (all P<0.001), there was no statistically significant in PD value between the two groups (P>0.05). The T1 value and T2 value of the transitional zone cancer group were lower than those in transitional zone benign prostatic hyperplasia group [1 073.3 (1 003.9, 1 164.9) ms vs 1 340.8 (1 208.5, 1 502.8) ms; 76.9 (74.8, 82.8) ms vs 95.1(82.8, 103.4) ms] (all P<0.001), there was no statistically significant in PD value between the two groups (P>0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) of T2 value was similar with the ADC value in discriminating peripheral zone cancer group from non-cancerous peripheral zone group(0.963 vs 0.991, P=0.105), while in discriminating transitional zone cancer group from transitional zone benign prostatic hyperplasia group, the AUC of T2 value、T1 value and ADC value were similar(0.867, 0.930 vs 0.938, all P>0.05). ADC value, T2 value all were negatively correlated with Gleason score (r=-0.747,-0.453, all P<0.001). T2 value and ADC value demonstrated equivalent diagnostic performance in discriminating low risk from intermediate/high risk prostate cancer, and there were no statistically significant (AUC: 0.787 vs 0.943, P=0.069). Conclusions: Quantitative relaxation time T1 and T2 values derived from synthetic MRI can discriminate prostate cancer from other benign pathologies, and T2 value have the equivalent diagnostic performance compared to ADC value. Synthetic MRI has high clinical application value, and T2 value can distinguish low risk prostate cancer from intermediate/high risk prostate cancer.""","""['N Song', 'T Wang', 'D Zhang', 'Z Wang', 'S R Zhang', 'J Yu', 'L Cai', 'A L Ma', 'Q Zhang', 'Z Q Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi""","""['Diagnosis and Grading of Prostate Cancer by Relaxation Maps From Synthetic MRI.', 'T1 Mapping of the Prostate Using Single-Shot T1FLASH: A Clinical Feasibility Study to Optimize Prostate Cancer Assessment.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Research Progress of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Radiomics in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent [68Ga]PSMA PET/MRI for staging or biopsy guidance, followed by radical prostatectomy at our institution between 07/2016 and 01/2020. The dominant lesion per patient was selected based on histopathology and correlated to PET/MRI in a multidisciplinary meeting, and quantified using SUVmax for PSMA uptake and ADCmean for diffusion restriction. PCa growth pattern was classified as expansive (EXP) or infiltrative (INF) according to its properties of forming a tumoral mass or infiltrating diffusely between benign glands by two independent pathologists.

A greater understanding of the molecular landscape, particularly the expression of immune-related pathways, will inform future immunotherapeutic strategies. Consensus nonnegative matrix factorization (cNMF) is a novel model of molecular classification analyzing gene expression data, focusing on biological interpretation of metagenes and selecting meaningful clusters.  Objective:   We aimed to identify molecular subtypes of prostate cancer using cNMF and correlate these with existing biomarkers to inform future immunotherapeutic strategies.  Methods:   A cohort of archival tumor specimens from hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant disease was studied. Whole transcriptomic profiles were generated using TruSeq RNA Access technology and subjected to cNMF. Comprehensive genomic profiling was performed with the FoundationOne assay. NMF subtypes were characterized by gene expression pathways, genomic alterations and correlated with clinical data, then applied to The Cancer Genome Atlas data set.  Results:   We studied 164 specimens, including 52 castration-resistant and 13 paired primary/metastatic specimens. cNMF identified four distinct subtypes. NMF1 (19%) is enriched for immune-related and stromal-related pathways with transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signature. NMF2 (36%) is associated with FOXO-mediated transcription signature and AKT signaling, NMF3 (26%) is enriched for ribosomal RNA processing, while NMF4 (19%) is enriched for cell cycle and DNA-repair pathways. The most common gene alterations included TMPRSS22 (42%), TP53 (23%), and DNA-repair genes (19%), occurring across all subtypes. NMF4 is significantly enriched for MYC and Wnt-signaling gene alterations. TMB, CD8 density, and PD-L1 expression were low overall. NMF1 and NMF4 were NMF2 was associated with superior overall survival.  Conclusions:   Using cNMF, we identified four molecularly distinct subtypes which may inform treatment selection.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 69 patients with pathologic confirmed prostate carcinoma who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Preoperative MUL was defined as the distance from the apex of prostate to the level of the urethra at penile bulb on the coronal image. Postoperative MUL was defined as the distance from the bladder neck to the level of the urethra at the penile bulb on the coronal image. MUL-retained rate was defined as the percentage of postoperative MUL to preoperative MUL. All patients received extraperitoneal LRP. Patients reported freedom from using safety pad (0 pad/d) were defined as urinary continence. Multivariate Logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of early continence recovery after LRP. Kaplan-Meier analyses and log-rank test were used to compare time to continence recovery between the groups.  Results:   For all the 69 patients, the average age was (71.4±8.6) years. The prostate specific antigen before biopsy was (23.40±30.31) μg/L, and the mean preoperative prostatic volume by magnetic resonance imaging was (39.48±22.73) mL.

Material and methods:   Patients over the ageof 75 with metastatic or castration-resistant prostatecancer were evaluated using the G8 questionnaire.Those with a G8 15 were subjected to comprehensivegeriatric assessment in order to evaluate the abilityof this questionnaire to predict frailty. We studiedthe relationship between G8 score and functionalstatus (ECOG), comorbidity (Charlson index), qualityof life (FACT-P and EQ5D 3L questionnaires), diseasecharacteristics and common analytical variables.  Results:   64 patients were included in the study,of whom 26 scored 15 in the G8 questionnaireand were referred to geriatrics. 89% (23/26) of thepatients with a G8 score pre-fragile and 7 fragile) and only 11% (3/26) wereconsidered robust. The multivariate model showsthat the Charlson index and the EQ5D 3L score areindependent predictors of frailty. The Charlson index(OR=1.68, p=0.022) increases the probability thatthe patient has a G8 score the EQ5D-3L score (OR-0.64, p-0.021) decreases thatprobability. Both quantitative variables were recodedinto binary variables from the most predictivepoint obtained from the ROC curves and included ina model: patients with Charlson index ≥4 (OR=3.17,p=0.047) and those with EQ5D- 3L score (OR=3.35, p=0.037) increased the likelihood of obtaininga G8 scoreconditions (neither Charlson ≥4 nor EQ5D-3L score 15.

In addition, MR-only treatment planning is becoming more common in prostate radiotherapy and compared to CT-MRI-based contouring results in notable smaller clinical target volume (CTV). Tight PTV margins coupled with MR-only planning raise a concern whether the margins are adequate enough to cover possible volumetric changes of the prostate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the volumetric change of the prostate and its effect on PTV margin during 5x7.25 Gy SBRT of the prostate.  Material and methods:   Twenty patients were included in the study. Three MRI scans, first prior to treatment (baseline), second after third fraction (mid-treatment) and third after fifth fraction (end-treatment) were acquired for each patient. Prostate contours were delineated on each MRI scan and used to assess the prostate volume and maximum prostate diameter on left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) directions at baseline, mid- and end-treatment.  Results:   Median (IQR) change in the prostate volume relative to the baseline was 12.0% (3.1, 17.7) and 9.2% (2.0, 18.9) at the mid- and end-treatment, respectively, and the change was statistically significant (p = 0.004 and p = 0.020, respectively). Compared to the baseline, median increase in the maximum LR, SI and AP prostate diameters were 0.8, 2.3 and 1.5 mm at mid-treatment, and 0.5, 2.5 and 2.3 mm at end-treatment, respectively.  Conclusion:   If prostate contouring is based solely on MRI (e.g., in MR-only protocol), additional margin of 1-2 mm should be considered to account for prostate swelling.

Methods:   In the non-clinical study using Microtaze® -AFM-712 (Alfresa Pharma Corporation, Osaka, Japan) with an MTC needle, MTC was performed using a transperineal approach to targeted canine prostatic tissue under real-time ultrasonography guidance. Using various MTC output and irradiation time combinations, the targeted and surrounding tissues (rectum, bladder and fat) were examined to confirm the extent of coagulative necrosis or potential cell death, and to compare intra-operative ultrasonography and pathology findings. The exploratory clinical trial was conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of MTC. Five selected patients underwent transperineal MTC to clinically single lesion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-visible lesions with Gleason score 3 + 4 or 4 + 4. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), MRI and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite questionnaire findings were compared before and 6 months after surgery.  Results:   The region of coagulative necrosis was predictable by monitoring of ultrasonically visible vaporization; thus, by placing the MTC needle at a certain distance, we were able to perform a safe procedure without adverse events affecting the surrounding organs. Based on the non-clinical study, which used various combinations of output and irradiation time, MTC with 30-W output for 60-s irradiation was selected for the prostate. Based on the predictable necrosis, the therapeutic plan (where to place the MTC needle to achieve complete ablation of the target and how many sessions) was strictly determined per patient. There were no serious adverse events in any patient and only temporary urinary symptoms related to MTC therapy were observed. Furthermore, post-treatment satisfaction was very high. All preoperative MRI-visible lesions disappeared, and PSA decreased by 55% 6 months after surgery.

Materials and methods:   Between June 2013 and December 2018, 444 patients received 5 × 9 Gy SABR over 5 consecutive days. Rectal distension-mediated SABR was employed via insertion of a 150-cm3 air-inflated endorectal balloon. A Foley catheter loaded with 3 beacon transponders was used for urethra visualization and online tracking. MRI-based planning using Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy - Image Guided Radiotherapy (VMAT-IGRT) with inverse dose painting was employed in delivering the planning target volume (PTV) dose and in sculpting exposure of organs at risk (OARs). A 2-mm margin was used for PTV expansion, reduced to 0 mm at the interface with critical OARs. All plans fulfilled Dmean ≥45 Gy. Target motion ≥2 mm/5 s motions mandated treatment interruption and target realignment prior to completion of the planned dose delivery.  Results:   Patient compliance to the rectal distension-mediated immobilization protocol was excellent, achieving reproducible daily prostate localization at a patient-specific retropubic niche. Online tracking recorded ≤1-mm intrafractional target deviations in 95% of treatment sessions, while target realignment in ≥2-mm deviations enabled treatment completion as scheduled in all cases. The cumulative incidence rates of late grade ≥2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were 5.3% and 1.1%, respectively. The favorable toxicity profile was corroborated by patient-reported quality of life (QOL) outcomes. Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir by 5 years was 0.19 ng/ml. The cumulative incidence rate of biochemical failure using the Phoenix definition was 2%, 16.6%, and 27.2% for the combined low/favorable-intermediate, unfavorable intermediate, and high-risk categories, respectively. Patients with a PSA failure underwent a 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (68Ga-PSMA) scan showing a 20.2% cumulative incidence of intraprostatic relapses in biopsy International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade ≥3.  Conclusion:   The rectal distension-mediated technique is feasible and well tolerated. Dose escalation to 45 Gy with urethra-sparing results in excellent toxicity profiles and PSA relapse rates similar to those reported by other dose-escalated regimens. The existence of intraprostatic recurrences in patients with high-risk features confirms the notion of a high α/β ratio in these phenotypes resulting in diminished effectiveness with hypofractionated dose escalation.""","""['Carlo Greco', 'Oriol Pares', 'Nuno Pimentel', 'Vasco Louro', 'Beatriz Nunes', 'Justyna Kociolek', 'Joep Stroom', 'Sandra Vieira', 'Dalila Mateus', 'Maria Joao Cardoso', 'Ana Soares', 'Joao Marques', 'Elda Freitas', 'Graça Coelho', 'Zvi Fuks']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Health-related quality of life of salvage prostate reirradiation using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy with urethral-sparing.', 'Target motion mitigation promotes high-precision treatment planning and delivery of extreme hypofractionated prostate cancer radiotherapy: Results from a phase II study.', 'Reproducibility and accuracy of a target motion mitigation technique for dose-escalated prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy.', 'Early outcomes of high-dose-rate brachytherapy combined with ultra-hypofractionated radiation in higher-risk prostate cancer.', 'MR-Guided Hypofractionated Radiotherapy: Current Emerging Data and Promising Perspectives for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Deep learning-based segmentation of prostatic urethra on computed tomography scans for treatment planning.', 'Health-related quality of life of salvage prostate reirradiation using stereotactic ablative radiotherapy with urethral-sparing.']"""

Material and methods:   A cohort of 36 patients was treated with radical cystectomy and histologically exhibited invasive BC and incidental PC. The number of cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG)-triplets (rs4045402) in the AR gene was assessed in tumor-free lymph nodes as well as rs743572 in the CYP17A1 gene and rs676033, rs523349, rs9282858 in the SRD5A2. In addition, the clinical significance of incidental PC based on the Epstein-criteria was assessed with regard to BC-specific recurrence-free survival (RFS). The median follow-up was 26 months (range: 4-68).  Results:   Patients with clinically significant PC had worse BC-specific RFS compared with patients with insignificant PC (P = 0.016). Patients with a PC volume of >0.2 cm3 had shorter 3-year BC-specific RFS compared with patients with a PC volume ≤0.2 cm3 (P = 0.025). The median number of CAG-triplets was 24 (mean ± SEM: 23 ± 2, interquartile range: 22-25, total range 18-29). Patients with a CAG-triplet number <23 exhibited significantly decreased 3-year BC specific RFS compared with patients with ≥23 repeats (27% vs. 65%; P = 0.026). No further significance were noted for the other tested SNPs and survival.

Methods:   Using SEER-Medicare data, we selected patients aged 66 years and older who completed systemic therapy between 2002 and 2014 for breast (stage I-III), lung (stage I-III), or prostate (stage I-IV) cancer. For each cancer, we estimated the risk of a composite endpoint of MDS or AML in patients receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) vs. not.  Results:   The 10-year cumulative risk difference (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] - no G-CSF) for MDS-AML was 0.45% (95% CI 0.13-0.77%) in breast cancer and 0.39% (95% CI 0.15-0.62%) in lung cancer.

In addition, the expression of CDK2, CCNE1 and p27KIP1 was evaluated by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting in 44 prostate cancer tissues and 31 benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues.  Results:   No association was found between CDK2 rs2069408, CCNE1 rs997669 or p27KIP1 rs2066827 polymorphisms and an increased risk of prostate cancer development. Higher CDK2 expression was more prevalent in those with rs2069408 GG genotype than in AA carriers (p>0.05). We also noted reduced p27KIP1 protein expression in those with the p27KIP1 G109 allele. No difference was observed for CCNE1 expression in relation to the risky genotype (CC). A significant association was detected between CCNE1 mRNA overexpression and development of higher-grade carcinomas (Gleason score >7, p<0.05).  Conclusion:   Polymorphisms CDK2 rs2069408, CCNE1 rs997669 and p27KIP1 rs2066827 have no significant impact on prostate cancer risk nor on the gene and protein expression of CDK2, CCNE1 and p27KIP1, although high CCNE1 expression was significantly associated with a higher tumour grade in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Márk Híveš', 'Jana Jurečeková', 'Ján Kliment', 'Marián Grendár', 'Peter Kaplán', 'Róbert Dušenka', 'Daniel Evin', 'Marta Vilčková', 'Klaudia Híveš Holečková', 'Monika Kmeťová Sivoňová']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Implication of malignancy and prognosis of p27(kip1), Cyclin E, and Cdk2 expression in epithelial ovarian tumors.', 'Cyclin D1 overexpression induces progestin resistance in T-47D breast cancer cells despite p27(Kip1) association with cyclin E-Cdk2.', 'Knockdown of protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 inhibits G1/S progression in prostate cancer cells through the regulation of components of the cell-cycle machinery.', 'Genetic Association Between CDKN1B rs2066827 Polymorphism and Susceptibility to Cancer.', 'Clinical characteristics and outcomes of phase I cancer patients with CCNE1 amplification: MD Anderson experiences.', 'Polymorphisms in the gene encoding CYP1A2 influence prostate cancer risk and progression.']"""

H3K27me3 is an epigenetic tri-methylation modification to histone H3 controlled by the demethylase JMJD3. JMJD3 is dysregulated in a wide range of cancers and has been shown to control the expression of a specific growth-modulatory gene signature, making it an interesting candidate to better understand prostate tumor progression in vivo. This study aimed to identify the impact of JMJD3 inhibition by its inhibitor, GSK4, on prostate tumor growth in vivo.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines were implanted into Balb/c nude male mice. The effects of the selective JMJD3 inhibitor GSK-J4 on tumor growth were analyzed by bioluminescence assays and H3K27me3-regulated changes in gene expression were analyzed by ChIP-qPCR and RT-qPCR.  Results:   JMJD3 inhibition contributed to an increase in tumor growth in androgen-independent (AR-) xenografts and a decrease in androgen-dependent (AR+). GSK-J4 treatment modulated H3K27me3 enrichment on the gene panel in DU-145-luc xenografts while it had little effect on PC3-luc and no effect on LNCaP-luc. Effects of JMJD3 inhibition affected the panel gene expression.  Conclusion:   JMJD3 has a differential effect in prostate tumor progression according to AR status. Our results suggest that JMJD3 is able to play a role independently of its demethylase function in androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Ordinal regression (or classification) considers the order of the values of the categorical labels and thus takes into account the order of grading scales used to assess the severity of different medical conditions. This paper presents a quantum-inspired deep probabilistic learning ordinal regression model for medical image diagnosis that takes advantage of the representational power of deep learning and the intrinsic ordinal information of disease stages. The method is evaluated on two different medical image analysis tasks: prostate cancer diagnosis and diabetic retinopathy grade estimation on eye fundus images. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only improves the diagnosis performance on the two tasks but also the interpretability of the results by quantifying the uncertainty of the predictions in comparison to conventional deep classification and regression architectures.

Briefly, we increased drug loading capacity of SMNA through the polymer grafting onto the WS2 nano-sheets. Specifically, poly (N-vinylcaprolactam) as a thermo-sensitive polymer was incorporated into the synthesized polymer networks. SMNA was characterized via TGA, XRD, FE-SEM and FT-IR techniques. The influential variables including pH (6), adsorption temperature (30°C), and contact time (10 min) were carefully optimized. After drug loading process, SMNA was exposed to 808 nm near-infrared light, the shrinkage of the thermo-sensitive polymer took place quickly and the loaded BLT released in a short time of laser irradiation. In the end, the extracted BLT was analyzed with RP-HPLC-UV system (at 270 nm wavelength).

However, pathways controlling steroidogenic enzyme expression and de novo androgen synthesis in prostate cancer (PCa) cells are largely unknown. In this study, we explored the potential roles of DAB2IP in testosterone synthesis and CRPC tumor growth. Indeed, DAB2IP loss could maintain AR transcriptional activity, PSA re-expression and tumor growth under castrated condition in vitro and in vivo, and reprogram the expression profiles of steroidogenic enzymes, including AKR1C3. Mechanistically, DAB2IP could dramatically inhibit the AKR1C3 promoter activity and the conversion from androgen precursors (i.e., DHEA) to testosterone through PI3K/AKT/mTOR/ETS1 signaling. Consistently, there was a high co-expression of ETS1 and AKR1C3 in PCa tissues and xenografts, and their expression in prostate tissues could also restore AR nuclear staining in castrated DAB2IP-/- mice after DHEA supplement.

Here, we examined the impact of resveratrol-mediated pharmacological activation of SIRT1 on the progression of HGPIN lesions (using the Pten-/- mouse model) and on prostate tumor development (using an orthotopic model of prostate cancer cells stably silenced for SIRT1). We show that precise SIRT1 modulation could benefit both cancer prevention and treatment. Positive effect of SIRT1 activation can prevent Pten deletion-driven development of HGPIN lesions in mice if resveratrol is administered early (pre-cancer stage) with little to no benefit after the establishment of HGPIN lesions or tumor cell implantation. Mechanistically, our results show that under androgen deprivation conditions, SIRT1 inhibition induces senescence as evidenced by decreased gene signature associated with negative regulators of senescence and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of SIRT1 potentiated growth inhibitory effects of clinical androgen receptor blockade agents and radiation. Taken together, our findings provide an explanation for the discrepancy regarding the role of SIRT1 in prostate tumorigenesis. Our results reveal that the bifurcated roles for SIRT1 may occur in stage and context-dependent fashion by functioning in an antitumor role in prevention of early-stage prostate lesion development while promoting tumor development and disease progression post-lesion development.

Background:   Several previous studies have suggested an increased risk of inguinal hernia repair after prostatectomy. Only a few studies have compared the risk by PCa treatment modalities.  Methods:   Data were collected between the years 1998 and 2016 from the national hospital discharge database HILMO and between the years 1998 and 2015 from the Finnish cancer registry to identify all men with prostate cancer with data on primary treatment available and information on inguinal hernia diagnoses and procedures among them. The risk of inguinal hernia repair among men managed with prostatectomy was compared to those treated with radiation therapy. Participants treated with prostatectomy were analyzed as a whole and separately stratified into subgroups managed with mini-invasive or open surgery. Multivariate Cox regression with adjustment for age and comorbidities was used for analysis.  Results:   A total of 7207 cases of PCa were included in the study. 4595 men were treated with radical prostatectomy and 2612 with radiation therapy. Overall, the risk of hernia repair was higher among men treated with prostatectomy compared to men who received radiation therapy as the primary PCa treatment (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.77).

Patients and methods:   Eighty-four consecutive men (66 ± 6.3 years) with a mean PSA level of 10.2 ± 7.4 ng/mL and at least one TZ-PI-RADS > 2 lesion were included. All patients had MRI-directed microUS and biopsy. Sensitivity and specificity of post-MRI microUS to visualize PI-RADS > 2 TZ lesions, the cancer detection rate of TZ-sPCa, and tumor characteristics according to their visibility on microUS were evaluated. Interreader agreement for detecting microUS+ lesions was evaluated using Cohen's kappa test.  Results:   Of the 92 PI-RADS > 2 lesions, 71 (71/92; 77%) were visible on microUS and biopsy was performed without image fusion, which was required for the 21 invisible lesions (21/92; 22.8%). TZ-sPCa detection rate was 51.1% (47/92). Sensitivity and specificity of MRI-directed microUS were 83% (39/47; 95% CI: 69.2-92.4%) and 28.9% (13/45; 95% CI: 16.4-44.3%), on a per-lesion basis and 86.4% (38/45; 95% CI: 72.6-94.8%) and 27.5% (11/40; 95% CI: 14.6-43.9%) on a per-patient basis. Visible tumors on microUS exhibited a larger volume and a lower mean ADC value than non-visible tumors (15.8 ± 5.1 vs. 12.5 ± 3.6 mm and 0.82 ± 1.1 × 103 vs. 0.9 ± 1.4 × 10-3 mm2/s) (p = 0.02). Non-visible tumors showed a heterogeneous non-specific echotexture or were masked by the shadowing caused by corpora amylacea. Interreader agreement was almost perfect (kappa = 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95). The main limitation is the single-center feature of the study.  Conclusion:   MRI-targeted transrectal microUS is effective to detect TZ-sPCa. TRUS-MRI image fusion helps overcome limitations due to TZ tissue heterogeneity.  Key points:   microUS can visualize the majority of MRI-detected PI-RADS > 2 TZ lesions (sensitivity = 83%). Interreader agreement of MRI-directed microUS in the detection of TZ lesions appears excellent (kappa = 0.88). In 77% of PI-RADS > 2 TZ lesions, biopsy was performed under microUS visual control.

Using the recent European Association of Urology and European Association of Nuclear Medicine recommendations, we aimed to compare response assessment between prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT and conventional imaging in mCRPC patients starting first-line treatment with a novel hormonal agent (NHA) and to perform a sequential comparative analysis of PSMA PET/CT-derived parameters after 4 and 12 wk of therapy. Methods: Data from 18 mCRPC patients who started NHA treatment and underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT before therapy initiation (baseline), at week 4 (W4), and at week 12 (W12) in addition to conventional imaging (bone scintigraphy, CT) at baseline and W12 were retrospectively included. PET/CT images were quantitatively analyzed for maximum and mean SUV and total PSMA ligand-positive lesions. Comparative analysis of PET/CT-derived parameters was performed, and patients were classified as having nonprogressive disease or progressive disease (PD) according to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, prostate-specific antigen, and conventional imaging criteria. Results: Treatment response was evaluable by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in 16 of 18 patients (89%) and by conventional imaging in 11 of 18 patients (61%). Five of 16 patients classified as having PD by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at W12 had already met progression criteria at W4, and substantial agreement was observed between W4 and W12 (κ, 0.74) 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results. Nonetheless, 2 of 16 patients (13%) were incorrectly classified as having PD because of a flare phenomenon on PSMA PET/CT that disappeared at W12. Conclusion: Volumetric assessments of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging can improve response evaluation in NHA-treated patients with mCRPC. Although early response assessments at W4 need to be approached with caution because of flare, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging at W4 and W12 revealed substantial agreement in therapy response assessments; these findings warrant further investigation to distinguish PD from flare at W4 and help improve the understanding of resistance to therapy.""","""['Chloé S Denis', 'François Cousin', 'Bram De Laere', 'Roland Hustinx', 'Brieuc R Sautois', 'Nadia Withofs']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Head-to-head comparisons of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT, multiparametric MRI, and prostate-specific antigen for the evaluation of therapeutic responses to neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy in high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer patients: a prospective study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Assessment of the role of Ga-68 PSMA I&T PET/CT in response evaluation to docetaxel therapy in castration resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'How PET-CT is Changing the Management of Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer?: Comment la TEP-TDM Peut Modifier la Prise en Charge du Cancer de la Prostate Non Métastatique Résistant à la Castration ?', 'Dual-Tracer PET-Computed Tomography Imaging for Precision Radio-Molecular Theranostics of Prostate Cancer: A Futuristic Perspective.', 'Heterogeneity of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: genomic characteristics and association with abiraterone response.']"""

Objective:   To provide improved characterisation of the prostate and urine microbiome and to investigate the prognostic potential of the bacteria present.  Design, setting, and participants:   Microbiome profiles were interrogated in sample collections of patient urine (sediment microscopy: n = 318, 16S ribosomal amplicon sequencing: n = 46; and extracellular vesicle RNA-seq: n = 40) and cancer tissue (n = 204).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Microbiomes were assessed using anaerobic culture, population-level 16S analysis, RNA-seq, and whole genome DNA sequencing.  Results and limitations:   We demonstrate an association between the presence of bacteria in urine sediments and higher D'Amico risk prostate cancer (discovery, n = 215 patients, p < 0.001; validation, n = 103, p < 0.001, χ2 test for trend). Characterisation of the bacterial community led to the (1) identification of four novel bacteria (Porphyromonas sp. nov., Varibaculum sp. nov., Peptoniphilus sp. nov., and Fenollaria sp. nov.) that were frequently found in patient urine, and (2) definition of a patient subgroup associated with metastasis development (p = 0.015, log-rank test). The presence of five specific anaerobic genera, which includes three of the novel isolates, was associated with cancer risk group, in urine sediment (p = 0.045, log-rank test), urine extracellular vesicles (p = 0.039), and cancer tissue (p = 0.035), with a meta-analysis hazard ratio for disease progression of 2.60 (95% confidence interval: 1.39-4.85; p = 0.003; Cox regression). A limitation is that functional links to cancer development are not yet established.  Conclusions:   This study characterises prostate and urine microbiomes, and indicates that specific anaerobic bacteria genera have prognostic potential.

In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of NK cells against human PCa cell lines and in vivo antitumor activity in a preclinical mouse model of CRPC. CCK-8 results demonstrated that the NK cells exerted potent cytotoxicity against all PCa cell lines in vitro. The NK cells were activated when cocultured with PCa C4-2 cells, evidenced by upregulation of the degranulation marker CD107a and secretion of cytokines (TNF-α and IFN-γ). In a xenograft mouse model of CRPC, the caliper, CT, and ultrasonography examination results showed that the size of tumors treated with NK cells was significantly smaller than that in the control group. Moreover, ultrasonography examination also indicated that the NK cell treatment evidently reduced the blood supply of the tumors and HE staining results demonstrated that the NK treatment increased the proportion of necrosis in the tumor specimen compared to PBS treatment. Meanwhile, the NK cell treatment did not cause significant serum IL-6 elevation. Therefore, our study suggested that the expanded NK cells exhibited significant cytotoxicity against PCa cell lines in vitro and excellent therapeutic efficacy against CRPC in a xenograft mouse model, which was of great value for the clinical treatment of CRPC.""","""['Fangming Wang', 'Xuejiao Dong', 'Jing Wang', 'Feiya Yang', 'Donghua Liu', 'Jianlin Ma', 'Shuai Liu', 'Dehua Chang', 'Nianzeng Xing']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol Res""","""['Combined treatment with anti-PSMA CAR NK-92 cell and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody enhances the antitumour efficacy against castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of IL-6-JAK/Stat3 signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells enhances the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity via alteration of PD-L1/NKG2D ligand levels.', 'Ex vivo expanded natural killer cells from breast cancer patients and healthy donors are highly cytotoxic against breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived tumours.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

In this study, the database GSE69223 was downloaded by the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, as well as CDCA8 expression differences in multiple tumor tissues and normal tissues were detected by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), TIMER, Oncomine, and Ualcan databases. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to analyze the correlation between CDCA8 expression and prognosis in PCa. We confirmed the expression of CDCA8 in PCa tissues by HPA. We also analyzed the association of CDCA8 expression with PCa clinical characteristics in the TCGA database. To further understand the role of CDCA8 in PCa, we assessed the effects of CDCA8 on PCa cell growth, proliferation, and migration in vitro studies. As a result, CDCA8 was significantly overexpressed in PCa cells compared with normal prostate cells. High CDCA8 expression predicts poor prognosis in PCa patients, and CDCA8 expression was higher in high-grade PCa.

We collected, digitized, and pixel-wise annotated the PNI findings in each of the approximately 80,000 biopsy cores from the 7406 men who underwent biopsy in a screening trial between 2012 and 2014. In total, 485 biopsy cores showed PNI. We also digitized more than 10% (n = 8318) of the PNI negative biopsy cores. Digitized biopsies from a random selection of 80% of the men were used to build the AI algorithm, while 20% were used to evaluate its performance. For detecting PNI in prostate biopsy cores, the AI had an estimated area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) based on 106 PNI positive cores and 1652 PNI negative cores in the independent test set. For a pre-specified operating point, this translates to sensitivity of 0.87 and specificity of 0.97. The corresponding positive and negative predictive values were 0.67 and 0.99, respectively. The concordance of the AI with pathologists, measured by mean pairwise Cohen's kappa (0.74), was comparable to inter-pathologist concordance (0.68 to 0.75).

We conducted a retrospective study of twelve patients with mPCa who had undergone neoadjuvant therapy followed by RARP. The endpoints were biochemical recurrence-free survival, treatment-free survival, and de novo metastasis-free survival. At the end of the follow-up period, none of the enrolled patients had died from PCa. The 1- and 2-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rates were 83.3% and 66.7%, respectively, and treatment-free survival rates were 75.0% and 56.3%, respectively. One patient developed de novo bone metastases 6.4 months postoperatively, and castration-resistant prostate cancer 8.9 months postoperatively. After RARP, the median duration of recovery of urinary continence was 5.2 months. One patient had severe incontinence (>2 pads/day) 24 months postoperatively.

Men and women are equally likely to pass on or inherit the pathogenic variant. However, there is evidence that male relatives are less involved in cascade screening than female ones. At the same time, little attention has been given to the research on psychological determinants of men's adherence to cascade screening in BRCA1/2-positive families. Applying some principles of the Health Action Process Approach model, the present research tested a model of relationships on the adherence to BRCA1/2 cascade testing guidelines. The sample comprised 115 men's first-degree relatives of women with verified germline mutations (Mage = 41.93; SD = 17.27). A pre-post test design was applied. Significant associations emerged between the intention to uptake BRCA1/2 genetic testing and age, parental status, breast cancer risk perception, self-referred outcome expectancies, perceived benefit, coping self-efficacy, and planning. Higher perceived benefit predicted increases in intention, and higher intention and coping self-efficacy predicted increases in planning. Intention was a positive total mediator of the relationship between benefit and planning. On a theoretical level, our findings partially supported the Health Action Process Approach as a valuable model based on which interventions could be developed in the context of cascade screening for BRCA1/2 genetic testing. Those results supported the importance of integrated genetic counselling sessions with a strict collaboration between geneticists and psychologists together with interventions planned to increase men's self-monitoring ability to support their self-efficacy.""","""['Giulia Ongaro', 'Serena Petrocchi', 'Mariarosaria Calvello', 'Bernardo Bonanni', 'Irene Feroce', 'Gabriella Pravettoni']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""[""A randomized controlled trial comparing self-referred message to family-referred message promoting men's adherence to evidence-based guidelines on BRCA1/2 germline genetic testing: A registered study protocol."", ""Investigating men's motivations to engage in genetic screening for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations."", 'A clinically structured and partnered approach to genetic testing in Trinidadian women with breast cancer and their families.', 'Germline BRCA1/2 mutation testing is indicated in every patient with epithelial ovarian cancer: A systematic review.', ""Men's decision-making about predictive BRCA1/2 testing: the role of family."", 'Decision-making process about prenatal genetic screening: how deeply do moms-to-be want to know from Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing?']"""

Before studying the biological role of molecular species of ether glycerolipids, there is a need to separate and quantify total alkyl and alkenyl glycerolipids from biological samples in order to determine any variation depending on tissue or physiopathological conditions. Here, we detail the development of the first high-performance thin-layer chromatography method for the quantification of total alkyl and alkenyl glycerolipids thanks to the separation of their corresponding alkyl and alkenyl glycerols. This method starts with a reduction of all lipids after extraction, resulting in the reduction of neutral and polar ether glycerolipids into alkyl and alkenyl glycerols, followed by an appropriate purification and, finally, the linearly ascending development of alkyl and alkenyl glycerols on high-performance thin-layer chromatography plates, staining, carbonization and densitometric analysis. Calibration curves were obtained with commercial alkyl and alkenyl glycerol standards, enabling the quantification of alkyl and alkenyl glycerols in samples and thus directly obtaining the quantity of alkyl and alkenyl lipids present in the samples. Interestingly, we found a differential quantity of these lipids in shark liver oil compared to chimera.

In advanced stages of prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is initiated. Despite ADT, prostate cancers invariably progress to become androgen independent. A growing body of evidence implicates iron dysmetabolism in prostate cancer progression. A bioactive peptide-rich salmon protein hydrolysate (SPH) has previously been demonstrated to modulate iron homeostatic mechanisms. In the present study, the anticancer effect of SPH and bicalutamide co-treatment on LNCaP and PC3 prostate cancer cell proliferation was investigated. Our results found that SPH potentiates the anti-proliferative effect of bicalutamide in a dose-dependent manner for both cell lines. In the presence of 160 µg/mL SPH, co-treatment with 1.0 µM bicalutamide decreased LNCaP cells' relative colony survival from 25% (1.0 µM bicalutamide monotreatment) to 2% after culturing for 12 days. For PC3 cells, the relative colony survival diminished from 52% (10.0 µM bicalutamide) to 32% at an SPH concentration of 160 µg/mL. Gene expression profiling, employing quantitative real-time PCR, revealed that the inhibitory effects were related to significant FTH1 up-regulation with a concomitant TFRC down-regulation.

Methods:   Prostate cancer stage-specific incidence rates, 5-year relative survival and mortality rates were estimated using New South Wales Cancer Registry data. PSA screening test rates and RP/Incidence ratios were estimated from Medicare Benefits Schedule claims data. We used multiple imputation to impute stage for cases with ""unknown"" stage at diagnosis. Annual percentage changes (APC) in rates were estimated using Joinpoint regression.  Results:   Trends in the age-standardized incidence rates for localized disease largely mirrored the trends in PSA screening test rates, with a substantial 'spike' in the rates occurring in 1994, followed by a second 'spike' in 2008, and then a significant decrease from 2008 to 2015 (APC -6.7, 95% CI -8.2, -5.1). Increasing trends in incidence rates were observed for regional stage from the early 2000s, while decreasing or stable trends were observed for distant stage since 1993. The overall RP/Incidence ratio increased from 1998 to 2003 (APC 9.6, 95% CI 3.8, 15.6), then remained relatively stable to 2015. The overall 5-year relative survival for prostate cancer increased from 58.4% (95% CI: 55.0-61.7%) in 1981-1985 to 91.3% (95% CI: 90.5-92.1%) in 2011-2015.

Conclusions:   Overall, there was a decrease in the incidence rate of localized prostate cancer after 2008, an increase in survival over time and a decrease in the mortality rate since the 1990s.

Limited data are available on direct out of pocket (OOP) costs for radiation therapy, which are important for providers and patients.  Methods and materials:   Retrospective analysis of 247 consecutive patients with nonmetastatic breast and prostate cancer treated with curative intent. Data were collected on demographics, treatments received and insurance plan specifications, including annual OOP maximum, deductibles, co-insurance rates, OOP already paid prior to starting radiation therapy, and actual estimated OOP for radiation therapy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between insurance factors, radiation technique, concurrent systemic therapy, and month of treatment with a patient reaching OOP maximum with radiation treatment.  Results:   In the study, 137 and 110 patients with breast and prostate cancer were evaluated. Mean plan specified annual OOP maximum for commercial and Medicare Advantage plans were $4064 and $4661, respectively; 100% of commercially insured patients and 54.7% Medicare Advantage patients reached their OOP maximum with radiation therapy. Annual OOP maximum for Medicare plus supplement, Medicaid, and Tricare were minimal. On multivariable analysis, concurrent systemic therapy (odds ratio 6.20, P = .03) was associated with patient reaching OOP maximum, but radiation technique was not.  Conclusions:   Out of pocket cost for radiation therapy services may be reasonably estimated based on insurance type and structure. Medicare plus supplement and Medicaid plans have negligible OOP, while all patients with commercial plans reached annual OOP maximums.

Advanced prostate cancers display AR hyperactivation and transcriptome expansion, in part, through AR amplification and interaction with oncoprotein cofactors. Despite its biological importance, how AR domains and cofactors cooperate to bind DNA has remained elusive. Using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we isolated three conformations of AR bound to DNA, showing that AR forms a non-obligate dimer, with the buried dimer interface utilized by ancestral steroid receptors repurposed to facilitate cooperative DNA binding.

The current strategy to support cancer survivors with impaired QoL is suboptimal, leading to unmet patient needs. ASCAPE aims to provide personalized- and artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictions for QoL issues in breast- and prostate cancer patients as well as to suggest potential interventions to their physicians to offer a more modern and holistic approach on cancer rehabilitation.  Methods and analyses:   An AI-based platform aiming to predict QoL issues and suggest appropriate interventions to clinicians will be built based on patient data gathered through medical records, questionnaires, apps, and wearables. This platform will be prospectively evaluated through a longitudinal study where breast and prostate cancer survivors from four different study sites across the Europe will be enrolled. The evaluation of the AI-based follow-up strategy through the ASCAPE platform will be based on patients' experience, engagement, and potential improvement in QoL during the study as well as on clinicians' view on how ASCAPE platform impacts their clinical practice and doctor-patient relationship, and their experience in using the platform.  Ethics and dissemination:   ASCAPE is the first research project that will prospectively investigate an AI-based approach for an individualized follow-up strategy for patients with breast- or prostate cancer focusing on patients' QoL issues. ASCAPE represents a paradigm shift both in terms of a more individualized approach for follow-up based on QoL issues, which is an unmet need for cancer survivors, and in terms of how to use Big Data in cancer care through democratizing the knowledge and the access to AI and Big Data related innovations.

We evaluated the clinical benefit of orteronel when added to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this open-label randomized phase III study, patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were randomly assigned 1:1 to ADT with orteronel (300 mg oral twice daily; experimental arm) or ADT with bicalutamide (50 mg oral once daily; control arm). The primary objective was the comparison of overall survival (OS), targeting a 33% improvement in median survival. A stratified log-rank test with a one-sided P ≤ .022 would indicate statistical significance. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at 7 months (≤ 0.2 v 0.2 to ≤ 4 v > 4 ng/mL), and adverse event profile.  Results:   Among 1,279 patients included in the analysis, 638 were randomly assigned to the ADT plus orteronel arm and 641 to the control arm. The median age was 68 years; 49% had extensive disease. After a median follow-up of 4.9 years, there was a significant improvement in PFS (median 47.6 v 23.0 months, hazard ratio 0.58; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.67; P < .0001) and PSA response at 7 months (P < .0001), but not in OS (median 81.1 v 70.2 months, hazard ratio 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.02; P = .040, one-sided). More grade 3/4 adverse events occurred in the experimental versus the control arms (43% v 14%). Postprotocol life-prolonging therapy was received by 77.4% of patients in the control arm and 61.3% of patients in the orteronel arm.

There is growing concern of the risk of ADT to be detrimental to quality of life. This single-institution retrospective analysis aimed to evaluate outcomes of IR patients treated with dose-escalated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with or without concurrent/adjuvant short-term ADT.  Materials and methods:   Data was collected from 260 consecutive patients treated with dose-escalated IMRT with daily image-guided RT for newly diagnosed IR prostate cancer. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), distant metastasis-free survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, and overall survival (OS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methodology.  Results:   Median follow-up was 93 months. A total of 181 patients had unfavorable IR disease, and 36.2% (N=94) received ADT, with median ADT duration of 6 months. Seven-year BCRFS was 94.1% vs. 86.2% (P=0.067), for ADT and no ADT, respectively, and no difference in distant metastasis-free survival or prostate cancer-specific survival was observed. ADT was associated with significantly worse 7-year OS (80.0% vs. 91.3%, P=0.010). Analysis of the unfavorable IR cohort alone, showed similar results; 7-year BCRFS and 7-year OS in patients who received ADT versus no ADT were 93.7% vs. 85.9% (P=0.093), and 79.0% vs. 90.6% (P=0.019), respectively.  Conclusions:   In our 15-year experience treating IR prostate cancer with dose-escalated IMRT with daily image-guided RT, short-term concurrent ADT was associated with a statistically significant worse OS.

This study aimed to identify a CD44-linked microRNAs (miRNAs) (miR-9, miR-34a, miR-203) for non-invasive diagnosis of bladder cancer from other urinary tract malignancies. The expression of CD44-linked miRNAs was examined in serum, urine, and tissue specimens of Indian UBC patients (N = 25). For this purpose, healthy subjects (N = 25) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (N = 10) patients were taken as controls. The relative expression of miRNAs was analyzed in serum, urine, and tissue samples using real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic potential of these miRNAs was accessed by plotting ROC curve. Increased miR-9 expression was observed in serum of UBC patients than healthy and BPH controls. In UBC patients, miR-34a expression was lower than healthy controls but non-significant as compared to BPH. miR-203 expression was considerably higher in serum of UBC patients but non-significant as compared to BPH controls. miR-203 was found to be considerably higher in urine samples from UBC patients as compared to BPH and healthy controls. The diagnostic potential of these miRNAs was evaluated using the ROC curve. Higher miR-203 levels in the urine of Indian UBC patients demonstrate its non-invasive diagnostic ability out of the three miRNAs studied.

Their high light output enables construction of small detectors with negligible stem effect and simple readout electronics. Experimental determination of absorbed-dose energy dependence of detectors relative to water is prevalent, but it can be prone to high detector positioning uncertainties and does not allow for decoupling of absorbed-dose energy dependence from other factors affecting detector response .  Purpose:   To investigate which measurement conditions and detector properties could affect their absorbed-dose energy dependence in BT in vivo dosimetry.  Methods:   We used a general-purpose Monte Carlo (MC) code PENELOPE for the characterization of high-Z inorganic scintillators with the focus on ZnSe ( Z ¯ = 32 $\bar{Z}=32$ ) Z. Two other promising media CsI ( Z ¯ = 54 $\bar{Z}=54$ ) and Al2 O3 ( Z ¯ = 11 $\bar{Z}=11$ ) were included for comparison in selected scenarios. We determined absorbed-dose energy dependence of crystals relative to water under different scatter conditions (calibration phantom 12 × 12 × 30 cm3 , characterization phantoms 20 × 20 × 20 cm3 , 30 × 30 × 30 cm3 , 40 × 40 × 40 cm3 , and patient-like elliptic phantom 40 × 30 × 25 cm3 ). To mimic irradiation conditions during prostate treatments, we evaluated whether the presence of pelvic bones and calcifications affect ZnSe response. ZnSe detector design influence was also investigated.  Results:   In contrast to low-Z organic and medium-Z inorganic scintillators, ZnSe and CsI media have substantially greater absorbed-dose energy dependence relative to water. The response was phantom-size dependent and changed by 11% between limited- and full-scatter conditions for ZnSe, but not for Al2 O3 . For a given phantom size, a part of the absorbed-dose energy dependence of ZnSe is caused not due to in-phantom scatter but due to source anisotropy. Thus, the absorbed-dose energy dependence of high-Z scintillators is a function of not only the radial distance but also the polar angle. Pelvic bones did not affect ZnSe response, whereas large and intermediate size calcifications reduced it by 9% and 5%, respectively, when placed midway between the source and the detector.  Conclusions:   Unlike currently prevalent low- and medium-Z scintillators, high-Z crystals are sensitive to characterization and in vivo measurement conditions. However, good agreement between MC data for ZnSe in the present study and experimental data for ZnSe:O by Jørgensen et al. (2021) suggests that detector signal is proportional to the average absorbed dose to the detector cavity. This enables an easy correction for non-TG43-like scenarios (e.g., patient sizes and calcifications) through MC simulations. Such information should be provided to the clinic by the detector vendors.""","""['Vaiva Kaveckyte', 'Erik B Jørgensen', 'Gustavo Kertzscher', 'Jacob G Johansen', 'Åsa Carlsson Tedgren']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Suitability of microDiamond detectors for the determination of absorbed dose to water around high-dose-rate 192 Ir brachytherapy sources.', 'Inorganic scintillation detectors for 192Ir brachytherapy.', 'Investigation of a synthetic diamond detector response in kilovoltage photon beams.', 'Determination of the dose rate around a HDR 192Ir brachytherapy source with the microDiamond and the microSilicon detector.', 'In vivo dosimetry in pelvic brachytherapy.', 'Evolution of Portable Sensors for In-Vivo Dose and Time-Activity Curve Monitoring as Tools for Personalized Dosimetry in Molecular Radiotherapy.']"""

There was no correlation between the DCS score and PCK within each treatment group (Spearman's rho RP = -0.249 and RT = -0.001).  Conclusion:   Decisional conflict was higher in men undergoing RP. Men were more anxious in the RP group regarding the time treatment was received from diagnosis. No correlation was observed between DC and PCK.

Materials and methods:   This prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical study was conducted from May 2021 to August 2021. Sixteen RARP procedures with the KD-SR-01 system were performed by 1 surgeon. The perioperative and followup data were prospectively recorded. Early oncologic outcomes were assessed according to surgical margin status and continence was defined as no more than 1 pad daily or urine leakage of ≤20 gm by the 24-hour pad weight test. Ergonomics were assessed with the NASA-TLX (National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index).  Results:   All cases were completed successfully without conversion to traditional RARP, laparoscopic surgery or open surgery. The median docking time, console time and urethrovesical anastomosis time were 5.9 (range, 2.5-11.5), 87 (range, 70-120) and 14.4 minutes (range, 12.0-25.7), respectively. The median estimated blood loss was 50 ml (range, 10-200). None of patients required intraoperative transfusion. The median postoperative hospital stay was 5 days (range, 4-10). Overall, a positive surgical margin occurred in 4 (25%) patients. No biochemical recurrence occurred within 1 month after surgery. The continence rate was 87.5% (14/16) at 1 month after catheter removal. No severe intraoperative or postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3) occurred.

A comprehensive elucidation of how this signaling pathway controls transcriptional and cotranscriptional processes could provide new insights into the key functions of PI3K signaling in cancer. Here, we undertook a transcriptomic approach to investigate genome-wide gene expression and transcription factor activity changes, as well as splicing and isoform usage dynamics, downstream of PI3K. These analyses uncovered widespread alternatively spliced isoforms linked to proliferation, metabolism, and splicing in PIK3CA-mutant cells, which were reversed by inhibition of PI3Kα. Analysis of paired tumor biopsies from patients with PIK3CA-mutated breast cancer undergoing treatment with PI3Kα inhibitors identified widespread splicing alterations that affect specific isoforms in common with the preclinical models, and these alterations, namely PTK2/FRNK and AFMID isoforms, were validated as functional drivers of cancer cell growth or migration. Mechanistically, isoform-specific splicing factors mediated PI3K-dependent RNA splicing. Treatment with splicing inhibitors rendered breast cancer cells more sensitive to the PI3Kα inhibitor alpelisib, resulting in greater growth inhibition than alpelisib alone. This study provides the first comprehensive analysis of widespread splicing alterations driven by oncogenic PI3K in breast cancer. The atlas of PI3K-mediated splicing programs establishes a key role for the PI3K pathway in regulating splicing, opening new avenues for exploiting PI3K signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in breast cancer.  Significance:   Transcriptomic analysis reveals a key role for the PI3K pathway in regulating RNA splicing, uncovering new mechanisms by which PI3K regulates proliferation and metabolism in breast cancer.

However, the drug loading efficiency of MSNs is low and is usually improved by improving textural properties through complicated synthesis methods or by post synthesis modification of the surface that can result in the loss of surface area and modify its drug release properties. In this study, we report a direct single-step synthesis of MSNs with a unique egg-yolk core-shell morphology, large pore volume and a hydrophilic surface, decorated with nitrogen rich surface functionalities for increasing its drug loading capacity. This combination of excellent textural properties and surface functionalisation was achieved by a simple soft templating method using dual surfactants and the silica sources assisted by employing either triethylamine (TEA) or triethanolamine (TEO) as the hydrolysis agent. The morphology and well-ordered mesoporous structure can simply be tuned by changing the pH of the synthesis medium that affects the self-assembly mechanism of the micelles. HRTEM image of samples clearly revealed an egg-yolk core-shell morphology with a thin mesoporous silica shell. The optimised MSN samples synthesized at a pH of 11 using either TEA or TEO depicted a higher doxorubicin (Dox) loading capacity of 425 μg mg-1 and 481 μg mg-1 respectively, as compared to only 347 μg mg-1 for MSN samples due to the uniform distribution of nitrogen functionalities. The anticancer activity of Dox loaded MSNs evaluated in two different prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) showed a higher cytotoxicity of the drug loaded on optimised MSN samples as compared to pristine MSNs without affecting the cellular uptake of the particles. These results suggest that the unique single-step synthesis and functionalisation method resulted in successfully achieving higher drug loading in egg-yolk core-shell nitrogen functionalised MSNs and could be implemented as an effective carrier of chemotherapeutic drugs.""","""['Steffi Tiburcius', 'Kannan Krishnan', 'Linta Jose', 'Vaishwik Patel', 'Arnab Ghosh', 'C I Sathish', 'Judith Weidenhofer', 'Jae-Hun Yang', 'Nicole M Verrills', 'Ajay Karakoti', 'Ajayan Vinu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""['Facile Synthesis of Three Types of Mesoporous Silica Microspheres as Drug Delivery Carriers and their Sustained-Release Properties.', 'Construction of calcium carbonate-liposome dual-film coated mesoporous silica as a delayed drug release system for antitumor therapy.', 'Polyaspartic acid-anchored mesoporous silica nanoparticles for pH-responsive doxorubicin release.', 'Mesoporous silica nanoparticles: synthesis, classification, drug loading, pharmacokinetics, biocompatibility, and application in drug delivery.', 'Mesoporous silica nanoparticles for therapeutic/diagnostic applications.']"""

Therapeutic targeting of c-Myc remains a challenge because of a disordered protein tertiary structure. The basic helical structure and zipper protein of c-Myc forms an obligate heterodimer with its partner MYC-associated factor X (MAX) to function as a transcription factor. An attractive strategy is to inhibit MYC/MAX dimerization to decrease c-Myc transcriptional function. Several methods have been described to inhibit MYC/MAX dimerization including small molecular inhibitors and proteomimetics. We studied the effect of a second-generation small molecular inhibitor 3JC48-3 on prostate cancer growth and viability. In our experimental studies, we found 3JC48-3 decreases prostate cancer cells' growth and viability in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro. We confirmed inhibition of MYC/MAX dimerization by 3JC48-3 using immunoprecipitation experiments. We have previously shown that the MYC/MAX heterodimer is a transcriptional repressor of a novel kinase protein kinase D1 (PrKD1). Treatment with 3JC48-3 upregulated PrKD1 expression and phosphorylation of known PrKD1 substrates: the threonine 120 (Thr-120) residue in beta-catenin and the serine 216 (Ser-216) in Cell Division Cycle 25 (CDC25C). The mining of gene expression in human metastatic prostate cancer samples demonstrated an inverse correlation between PrKD1 and c-Myc expression. Normal mice and mice with patient-derived prostate cancer xenografts (PDX) tolerated intraperitoneal injections of 3JC48-3 up to 100 mg/kg body weight without dose-limiting toxicity. Preliminary results in these PDX mouse models suggest that 3JC48-3 may be effective in decreasing the rate of tumor growth. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that 3JC48-3 is a potent MYC/MAX heterodimerization inhibitor that decreases prostate cancer growth and viability associated with upregulation of PrKD1 expression and kinase activity.""","""['Sanjeev Shukla', 'Steven Fletcher', 'Jay Chauhan', 'Victor Chalfant', 'Carlos Riveros', 'Yuri Mackeyev', 'Pankaj Kumar Singh', 'Sunil Krishnan', 'Teruko Osumi', 'K C Balaji']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Gene Ther""","""[""Discovery of methyl 4'-methyl-5-(7-nitrobenzoc1,2,5oxadiazol-4-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-3-carboxylate, an improved small-molecule inhibitor of c-Myc-max dimerization."", 'Beta-catenin represses protein kinase D1 gene expression by non-canonical pathway through MYC/MAX transcription complex in prostate cancer.', 'Myc phosphorylation in its basic helix-loop-helix region destabilizes transient α-helical structures, disrupting Max and DNA binding.', 'Structural aspects of interactions within the Myc/Max/Mad network.', 'Function of the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor.', 'Demystifying the Druggability of the MYC Family of Oncogenes.']"""

Human and mouse tissues are used to examine whether systemic targeting of inflammation limits prostatic inflammation and hyperplasia. Evaluation of 112,152 medical records indicates that benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) prevalence is significantly higher among patients with AI diseases. Furthermore, treating these patients with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-antagonists significantly decreases BPH incidence.

Removal of the anterior prostatic fat tissue is a simple procedure and is considered useful for evaluating the stump, and in this hospital, the tissue is routinely submitted for pathological diagnosis. It is extremely unlikely that lymph nodes will be found in the anterior prostatic fat tissue, and it is even less likely that any lymph node in the tissue will contain lymph node metastases.

(Patients and methods) From February 2005 to February 2019, 179 patients underwent ORC and ICC for invasive bladder cancer or BCG unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. We investigated intraoperative and early postoperative complications, overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and poor prognostic factors affecting OS. Furthermore, we evaluated the prognosis of patients with pT3,4 or pN1-3 depending on adjuvant chemotherapy. (Results) Clavien-Dindo Grade 4 or 5 complications were not occurred. The 5-year and 10-year OS probability were 71.1% and 57.4%, respectively, while the 5-year and 10-year CSS probability were 76.5% and 71.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that male (HR = 2.70, 95%CI [0.97-7.51]), pT3,4 (HR = 1.83, 95%CI [1.05-3.21]), and pN1-3 (HR = 2.85, 95%CI [1.62-5.03]) were independent poor prognostic factors. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved OS (p = 0.03) and CSS (p = 0.017) in pN1-3 patients. (Conclusion) ORC combined with ICC was an effective operative method, and good results were obtained.

Although they are expected to prolong the survival time of patients with advanced prostate cancer, they may result in an economic burden. In this study, we determined the treatment results and the cost of CRPC drugs. (Methods) From 2014 to 2017, patients who were unfit for curative therapy were enrolled in this study. First, they received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by surgical or chemical castration. Once castration-sensitive cancer progressed to castration-resistant cancer, CRPC drugs, such as docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone and enzalutamide, were administered sequentially. In elderly or fragile patients, drug doses were often reduced to minimize their toxicity. The total costs of drugs for castration-sensitive and castration-resistant cancers were calculated, and the results were evaluated. (Results) Prostate biopsies detected prostate cancer in 257 patients. Eighty-one patients were treated with ADT, and 56 of the cancers were metastatic or showed a high prostate specific antigen level (>100 ng/ml). Thirty patients out of the 56 with advanced cancers developed CRPC, and the median time to CRPC was 10 months (range, 3-39). Drugs targeting CRPC were administered in 25 patients for a median duration of 20 months (range, 3-50). During the median observation period of 48 months (range, 13-75), 15 patients died of prostate cancer. The median annual cost of drugs for castration-sensitive cancer was 234,000 Japanese yen (2,187 US dollars) [range, 50,000-315,000 yen (467-2,943 US dollars) ]. In contrast, the median annual cost of drugs for CRPC was 2,041,000 yen (19,075 US dollars) [range, 346,000-5,017,000 yen (3,230-46,886 US dollars) ]. (Conclusions) Advanced prostate cancer tended to rapidly progress to CRPC, which required a sequence of expensive drugs for treatment.

The number of years of life lost (YLL) due to prostate cancer is a metric of the toll of prostate cancer and using projections of demographic changes, can be used to measure future burden.  Methods:   Prostate cancer mortality data by country and world region was retrieved from the Global Cancer Observatory and the World Health Organization mortality data set, and life expectancy was from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. We estimated YLL as the difference between age at death in people with prostate cancer and remaining life expectancy for people of the same age in the general population. We also estimated the age-standardized YLL rates per 100,000 males over 50 and the average annual percentage change in YLL rates over the period 2000-2019 and the number of YLL for the year 2040 by applying population projections to the 2020 YLL rates.  Results:   In 2020, 3.5 million person-years of life were lost due to prostate cancer in males over 50, and 40% of YLL were in those aged over 75. Age-standardized rates varied greatly between and within regions. Over the last two decades, rates of YLL have increased in many Asian and African countries while they have decreased in northern American and European countries. Globally, YLL are anticipated to double by 2040 to reach 7.5 million, with the greatest increases in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean.  Conclusion:   There are wide variations in the burden of prostate cancer globally as measured by YLL. The burden of prostate cancer is projected to increase over time and appears to be highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. It will be critical to plan and implement programs to reduce the burden of prostate cancer globally.""","""['Diana Withrow', 'Sophie Pilleron', 'Nikita Nikita', 'Jacques Ferlay', 'Swapnil Sharma', 'Brian Nicholson', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Grace Lu-Yao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Alternative projections of mortality and disability by cause 1990-2020: Global Burden of Disease Study.', 'Forecasting life expectancy, years of life lost, and all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 250 causes of death: reference and alternative scenarios for 2016-40 for 195 countries and territories.', 'Disease burden of prostate cancer among men in China, from 1990 to 2013.', 'Projecting the impact of AIDS on mortality.', 'Recent Global Patterns in Prostate Cancer Incidence and Mortality Rates.', 'Construction of fluorescence and colorimetric tandem dual-mode sensor by modulating fluorescence and oxidase-like activity via valence switching of cerium-based coordination polymer nanoparticles for sarcosine detection.', 'Cabazitaxel-Loaded Nanoparticles Reduce the Invasiveness in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells: Beyond the Classical Taxane Function.', 'Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) gene polymorphism with susceptibility to prostate cancer: an updated meta-analysis.', 'Effect of high-intensity interval training on aerobic capacity and fatigue among patients with prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

The PSMA overexpression resulted in an increase of cell-bound radioligand [68Ga]Ga-1 (PSMA) for PCa and BCa cells and also of [68Ga]Ga-2 (GRPR), especially in those cell lines already expressing GRPR. The results were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting with a PE-labeled PSMA-specific antibody and the fluorescence tracer 3. The docking calculations and molecular dynamics simulations showed how 1 enters the PSMA funnel region and how pharmacophore Glu-urea-Lys interacts with the arginine patch, the S1', and S1 subpockets by forming hydrogen and van der Waals bonds. The chelating moiety of 1, that is, HBED-CC, forms additional stabilizing hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in the arene-binding site. Ligand 2 is diving into the GRPR transmembrane (TM) helical cavity, thereby forming hydrogen bonds through its amidated end, water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and π-π interactions. Our results provide valuable information regarding the molecular mechanisms involved in the interactions of 1 and 2 with PSMA and GRPR, which might be useful for the diagnostic imaging and therapy of PCa and BCa.""","""['Christos Liolios', 'Christos Patsis', 'George Lambrinidis', 'Efpraxia Tzortzini', 'Mareike Roscher', 'Ulrike Bauder-Wüst', 'Antonios Kolocouris', 'Klaus Kopka']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Monomeric and Dimeric 68Ga-Labeled Bombesin Analogues for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Imaging of Tumors Expressing Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptors (GRPrs).', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Dual-Modality Imaging of Prostate Cancer with a Fluorescent and Radiogallium-Labeled Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Antagonist.', 'Imaging of Prostate Cancer Using Gallium-68-Labeled Bombesin.', 'Current use of PSMA-PET in prostate cancer management.', 'Up-Regulation of PSMA Expression In Vitro as Potential Application in Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Computer-Assisted Design of Peptide-Based Radiotracers.', 'Hetero-bivalent agents targeting FAP and PSMA.']"""

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of proteolytic enzymes that play a key role in the metastatic process via degrading extracellular matrix. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of irisin on expression of metastatic markers MMP2 and MMP9 and induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   In this study, we examined the effect of different concentrations of irisin on induced apoptosis and cell viability of two cell lines, LNCaP and DU-145, by using flow cytometry and MTT assay, respectively. The expression of MMP2 and MMP9 genes was also analyzed by real-time PCR after irisin treatment. Data were analyzed using the comparative cycle threshold 2-∆∆Ct method.  Results:   Cell viability was reduced in both LNCaP and DU-145 cell lines at different concentrations of irisin. However, this decreased cell viability was strongly significant (p < 0.05) only at 5 and 10 nM concentrations of irisin in the LNCaP cell line. Furthermore, irisin could induce apoptosis in both cell lines at a concentration of 10 nM compared to 5 nM. Real-time PCR results also demonstrated a decreased expression in MMP2 and MMP9 genes in a concentration-dependent manner in both cell lines.  Conclusion:   These results showed the anticancer effects of irisin on cell viability of both LNCaP and DU-145 cell lines and also on the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 genes occurred in a dose- and time-dependent manner.""","""['Atiye Saeedi Sadr', 'Hassan Ehteram', 'Elahe Seyed Hosseini', 'Marziyeh Alizadeh Zarei', 'Hassan Hassani Bafrani', 'Hamed Haddad Kashani']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncol Ther""","""['Correction to: The Effect of Irisin on Proliferation, Apoptosis, and Expression of Metastasis Markers in Prostate Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Effects of the exercise-inducible myokine irisin on proliferation and malignant properties of ovarian cancer cells through the HIF-1 α signaling pathway.', 'Matrix metalloproteinases MMP1, MMP2, MMP9 and their tissue inhibitors TIMP1, TIMP2, TIMP3 in head and neck cancer: an immunohistochemical study.', 'Down-regulation of urokinase plasminogen activator and matrix metalloproteinases and up-regulation of their inhibitors by a novel nutrient mixture in human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 and DU-145.', 'Crosstalk Between Muscle and Bone Via the Muscle-Myokine Irisin.', 'Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -2, -7 and -9 promoter polymorphisms in colorectal cancer in ethnic Kashmiri population - A case-control study and a mini review.', 'Expression and Prognostic Significance of Stem Cell Marker CD133 in Survival Rate of Patients with Colon Cancer.']"""

There are contradictive reports on differences in toxicity of docetaxel in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. Possible differences in toxicity might be attributed to different pharmacokinetics (PK) in the two patient populations.  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC or mHSPC and a standard indication for docetaxel treatment were included in the study. All patients had suppressed serum testosterone levels (≤ 0.5 ng/mL or 1.73 nmol/L). Venous blood samples were obtained at the first docetaxel treatment, until 48 h after infusion. Plasma concentrations of docetaxel, unbound docetaxel and docetaxel metabolites were measured using validated liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assays and compared between the two groups. Moreover, serum levels of docetaxel transporting α1-acid glycoprotein were measured and docetaxel toxicity recorded.  Results:   A total of ten mCRPC and nine mHSPC patients were included in the study. The two cohorts differed in the number of prior treatments and opiate use, which were higher for mCRPC patients. The docetaxel PK was not different between mCRPC and mHSPC patients, with areas under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC0-48) 1710 [coefficient of variation (CV) 28.4%] and 1486 (CV 25.2%) ng/mL*h (p = 0.27), respectively. Also, the PK profile of unbound docetaxel, M1/M3, M2 and M4 metabolites were similar in both groups. Docetaxel doses were reduced in 50% of the mCRPC patients and 11% of the mHSPC patients.  Conclusion:   The PK profile of docetaxel was similar in mCPRC and mHSPC patients. Therefore, possible differences in toxicity between mCRPC and mHSPC patients cannot be explained by differences in docetaxel PK in our study population. These results suggest that treatment adaptations are not recommended in the new population of patients with mHSPC.""","""['Marit A C Vermunt#', 'Merel van Nuland#', 'Lisa T van der Heijden', 'Hilde Rosing', 'Jos H Beijnen', 'Andries M Bergman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Comparative assessment of docetaxel for safety and efficacy between hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Docetaxel-related toxicity in metastatic hormone-sensitive and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Does castration status affect docetaxel-related adverse events? :Identification of risk factors for docetaxel-related adverse events in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'The role of chemotherapy in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'New treatment approaches for and ongoing trials in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Zebrafish patient-derived xenografts accurately and quickly reproduce treatment outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer patients.']"""

Materials and methods:   Retrieve and obtain data on differential gene expression of prostate cancer radiosensitivity in the GEO database (GSM3954350, GSM3954351, GSM3954352), GER2 tool to screen and analyze the differential genes, Enrichr database for enrichment analysis of GO and KEGG, use Cytoscape software builds protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and analyzes key genes.  Results:   A total of 7041 differentially expressed genes were screenedout, including 3842 high expression genes and 3199 low expressed genes. The top 20 differentially expressed genes were selected for further analysis. Their biological functions are mainly enriched in the following aspects: ""Cell communication"" and ""Signal transduction""; cytological components are mainly located outside the cell; molecular functions are enriched in structural molecular activity, receptor binding, serine-like peptidase activity, etc. The KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the mismatch repair pathway, non-homologous terminal binding pathway and so on. Survival analysis showed that VGF gene was associated with the prognosis of prostate cancer patients receiving radiotherapy, and high expression of VGF significantly reduced progression-free survival(PFS) in these patients(HR = 4.84, 95% CI: 1.34-17.5, P = .016).

We also studied the preoperative factors which can predict EPE.  Materials and methods:   In our institute, 294 patients underwent robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) between December 2012 and August 2016. In this era, we performed MRI after biopsy to determine clinical stage before surgery. PI-RADS v2 scores were retrospectively reviewed using biparametric MRI and EPE in pathological mapping of resected specimens for each lobe.  Results:   In the excised specimen, EPE was observed in 73 lobes (12%). The percentage of EPE by PI-RADS v2 score was score '1': 6% (17/297 lobes), '2': 3% (1/33 lobes), '3': 12% (8/67 lobes), '4': 19% (27/139 lobes), and '5': 38% (20/52 lobes). The higher the PI-RADS score, the higher the percentage of EPE (P <0.01). When classified as PI-RADS score ≥4 and <4, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 24.6% (47/191 lobes, 95%CI: 0.187 - 0.313) and negative predictive value (NPV) was 93.5% (371/397 lobes, 95%CI: 0.906 - 0.957). By multivariate analysis, positive biopsy core percentage ≥60%, and PI-RADS score ≥4 were independent factors for predicting EPE.

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of PSMA PET/CT in defining superior extent of TT in RCC and TT IVC tributary vessel spread, with comparative accuracy vs. MRI, to assess suitability for resection and inform preoperative surgical planning.  Methods:   Patients who underwent PSMA PET/CT for assessment of renal malignancy with TT from 2015 to 2020 at 3 tertiary hospitals in Brisbane, Australia, were retrospectively identified. TT extent was classified using Mayo Clinic levels and compared according to imaging modality.  Results:   Fourteen patients were included, all of which were clear cell RCC. Ten patients also underwent MRI, 6 of which were concordant in extent according to MRI and PSMA PET. Discordant extent occurred in 4 patients, of which 2 patients had non-PSMA avid thrombus (Mayo level 0 and level 3 on MRI). Further discordance was seen in a patient with adrenal vein and lumbar vein TT only seen on MRI and PSMA PET/CT, respectively. Finally, discordant extent was seen in another patient with Mayo level 4 TT without lumbar vein involvement on MRI vs. level 3 on PSMA PET/CT with lumbar vein involvement.

The survey found that prostate cancer accounts for one in three male cancer patients infected with COVID-19. This undoubtedly makes prostate cancer patients face a more difficult situation. Prostate cancer is the second most harmful malignant tumor in men because of its insidious onset, easy metastasis, and easy development into castration-resistant prostate cancer even after treatment. Due to its high immunogenicity and a small number of specific infiltrating T cells with tumor-associated antigens in the tissue, it is difficult to obtain a good therapeutic effect with immune checkpoint blocking therapy alone. Therefore, in the current study, we developed a platform carrying Doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded black phosphate nanometer combined with photothermal therapy (PTT) and found this drug combination stimulated the immungentic cell death (ICD) process in PC-3 cells and DC maturation. More importantly, zinc ions have a good immunomodulatory function against infectious diseases, and can improve the killing ability of the nanosystem against prostate cancer cells.

This study reviews the risk and tumor characteristics of secondary bladder cancer after brachytherapy.  Methods:   This single-institution retrospective study included 1162 patients treated with low-dose-rate permanent seed implantation brachytherapy with iodine-125, with or without external beam radiation therapy, for localized prostate cancer. We calculated and compared the rates of secondary bladder cancer among patients treated with brachytherapy and radical prostatectomy (n = 218) before and after a propensity score-matching analysis. Possible risk factors for secondary bladder cancer, such as patient age and external beam radiation therapy administration, were analyzed.  Results:   Of 1162 patients with a median follow-up period of 11.4 (range: 0.7-15.5) years, 26 presented with urothelial carcinomas and 1 with adenocarcinoma at a median of 8.9 (range: 2.9-14.0) years after brachytherapy, although the incidence rates of secondary bladder cancer after brachytherapy were not significantly different from those after radical prostatectomy. No significant risk factors for secondary bladder cancer were identified. The initial symptoms of secondary bladder cancer were gross hematuria (74%) and microscopic hematuria with positive urine cytology (15%). Among 26 cases of secondary urothelial carcinoma, 54% were high-grade and 46% were invasive. After brachytherapy, invasive urothelial carcinoma occurred later than noninvasive urothelial carcinoma (p = 0.01).

We have previously shown that decreased PTN expression in human prostate cancer PC3 cells leads to decreased adhesion of prostate cancer cells to osteoblasts, suggesting that PTN mediates this interaction. In the current work, using peptides that correspond to different regions of the PTN protein, we identified that a domain responsible for the adhesion of prostate cancer cells to osteoblasts corresponds to amino acids 16-24 of the mature PTN protein. Given that a synthetic PTN16-24 peptide which disturbs the interaction of PTN with nucleolin (NCL) was found to inhibit prostate cancer cells' adhesion to osteoblasts, it seems that NCL mediates the cellular interactions involved in the adhesion process. Two pseudopeptides that bind to cell surface NCL and an anti-NCL antibody also decrease prostate cancer cell adhesion to osteoblasts to the same degree as PTN16-24, further supporting the involvement of cell surface NCL in this interaction. Collectively, our data suggest that NCL on the cell surface of osteoblasts may mediate adhesion of prostate cancer cells through PTN and identify peptides that could be exploited therapeutically to target this component of prostate cancer bone metastases.""","""['Margarita Lamprou', 'Marina Koutsioumpa', 'Angelos Kaspiris', 'Katerina Zompra', 'Theodoros Tselios', 'Evangelia Papadimitriou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Tissue Cell""","""['Implications of pleiotrophin in human PC3 prostate cancer cell growth in vivo.', 'Pleiotrophin inhibits HIV infection by binding the cell surface-expressed nucleolin.', 'Pleiotrophin expression and role in physiological angiogenesis in vivo: potential involvement of nucleolin.', 'Pleiotrophin and its receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase beta/zeta as regulators of angiogenesis and cancer.', 'Cell surface nucleolin as a target for anti-cancer therapies.', 'Pleiotrophin and metabolic disorders: insights into its role in metabolism.', 'Single-cell RNA-seq reveals the communications between extracellular matrix-related components and Schwann cells contributing to the earlobe keloid formation.']"""

However, it could potentially play a role in potentiating anti-tumor immunity in the immunologically ""cold"" metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by inducing antigen presentation pathways and concurrently providing targets for immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Moreover, it could additionally increase sensitivity to chemotherapy based on its pleiotropic effects on cell phenotype. Here, we show that IFNγ treatment induced expression of major histocompatibility class-I (MHC-I) genes and PD-L1 in prostate cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, IFNγ treatment led to a decrease in E-cadherin expression with a consequent increase in sensitivity to chemotherapy in vitro. In an in vivo murine tumor model of spontaneous metastatic prostate cancer, IFNγ systemic pretreatment upregulated the expression of HLA-A and decreased E-cadherin expression in the primary tumor, and more importantly in the metastatic site led to increased apoptosis and limited micrometastases in combination with paclitaxel treatment compared to diffuse metastatic disease in control and monotherapy treatment groups.

Utilising this protocol, we assessed the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein alterations in a cohort of benign and malignant prostate samples. Mitochondrial OXPHOS plays a critical role in cell metabolism, and OXPHOS perturbation is implicated in carcinogenesis. Marked inter-patient, intra-patient and spatial cellular heterogeneity in OXPHOS protein abundance was observed.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighty-four patients pathologically confirmed as having PCa or benign disease were enrolled. All patients underwent multiparametric MRI before biopsy, added intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging, and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). The following data were collected: quantitative parameters of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), IVIM, and DKI, preoperative total PSA, free/total PSA ratio, and PSA density (PSAD) values. A combined logistic regression model was established by above MRI quantitative parameters and PSA data to diagnose PCa. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADS v2) was used to assess the lesions for comparison. RESULTS Thirty-two patients had PCa and 52 patients had benign lesions. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, only apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and PSAD were significant variables (P<0.05) and were thus retained in the model. The area under curve value of the combined model (0.911) was higher than that of ADC, PSAD, and PI-RADS v2 (0.887, 0.861, and 0.859, respectively) in univariate analysis, but without any statistically significant differences. The combined model generated greater clinical benefit than the independent application of ADC, PSAD, and PI-RADS v2.

Plant-derived bioactive compounds, such as pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs), have the ability to inhibit PCa cell proliferation. We isolated and characterized nummularic acid (NA), a potent PT, as a major chemical constituent of Ipomoea batatas, a medicinal food plant used in ethnomedicine for centuries. In the current study, in vitro antiproliferative potential against PCa cells (DU145 and PC3) via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay; Western blot protein expression analysis; absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME); pharmacokinetic prediction studies; and bisphenol A (BPA)-induced prostate inhibition in Sprague Dawley rats were conducted to gauge the anti-cancer ability of NA. Significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) time- and dose-dependent reductions in proliferation of PCa cells, reduced migration, invasion, and increased apoptotic cell population were recorded after NA treatment (3−50 µM). After 72 h of treatment, NA displayed significant IC50 of 21.18 ± 3.43 µM against DU145 and 24.21 ± 3.38 µM against PC3 cells in comparison to the controls cabazitaxel (9.56 ± 1.45 µM and 12.78 ± 2.67 µM) and doxorubicin (10.98 ± 2.71 µM and 15.97 ± 2.77 µM). Further deep mechanistic studies reveal that NA treatment considerably increased the cleavage of caspases and downstream PARP, upregulated BAX and P53, and downregulated BCL-2 and NF-κB, inducing apoptosis in PCa cells. Pharmacokinetic and ADME characterization indicate that NA has a favorable physicochemical nature, with high gastrointestinal absorption, low blood−brain barrier permeability, no hepatotoxicity, and cytochrome inhibition. BPA-induced perturbations of prostate glands in Sprague Dawley rats show a potential increase (0.478 ± 0.28 g) in prostate weight compared to the control (0.385 ± 0.13 g). Multi-dose treatment with NA (10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the prostate size (0.409 ± 0.21 g) in comparison to the control. NA-treated groups exhibited substantial restoration of hematological and histological parameters, reinstatement of serum hormones, and suppression of inflammatory markers. This multifaceted analysis suggests that NA, as a novel small molecule with a strong pharmacokinetic and pharmacological profile, has the potential to induce apoptosis and death in PCa cells.""","""['Muhammad Majid', 'Anam Farhan', 'Muhammad Imran Asad', 'Muhammad Rashid Khan', 'Syed Shams Ul Hassan', 'Ihsan-Ul Haq', 'Simona Bungau']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Ameliorative Effect of Structurally Divergent Oleanane Triterpenoid, 3-Epifriedelinol from Ipomoea batatas against BPA-Induced Gonadotoxicity by Targeting PARP and NF-κB Signaling in Rats.', 'Nummularic acid, a triterpenoid, from the medicinal plant Fraxinus xanthoxyloides, induces energy crisis to suppress growth of prostate cancer cells.', 'Betulinic Acid-Mediated Apoptosis in Human Prostate Cancer Cells Involves p53 and Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-κB) Pathways.', 'Regulation of signaling pathways involved in lupeol induced inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Ursolic Acid against Prostate and Urogenital Cancers: A Review of In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.', 'Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles mediated Diospyros kaki L.

In addition, high levels of Spp1 transcripts, also known as osteopontin, were identified in these macrophages. Extraneously added Spp1 accelerated PIN cell proliferation through activation of Akt and JNK in a 3D culture setting. We also showed that PIN cells expressed CD44, integrin αv, integrin β1, and integrin β3, all of which have been previously reported as receptors for Spp1.

We developed an ELISA quantifying type XX collagen, named PRO-C20, using a monoclonal antibody raised against the C-terminus. PRO-C20 and PRO-C1, an ELISA targeting the N-terminal pro-peptide of type I collagen, was measured in sera of 219 patients with various solid cancer types and compared to sera levels of 33 healthy controls. PRO-C20 was subsequently measured in a separate cohort comprising 36 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and compared to 20 healthy controls and 11 patients with chronic pancreatitis. PRO-C20 was significantly elevated in all cancers tested: bladder, breast, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, lung, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and stomach cancer (p < 0.01−p < 0.0001). PRO-C1 was only elevated in patients with ovarian cancer. PRO-C20 could discriminate between patients and healthy controls with AUROC values ranging from 0.76 to 0.92. Elevated levels were confirmed in a separate cohort of patients with PDAC (p < 0.0001). High PRO-C20 levels (above 2.57 nM) were predictive of poor survival after adjusting for the presence of metastasis, age, and sex (HR: 4.25, 95% CI: 1.52−11.9, p-value: 0.006).

In high-grade and castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (CRPC), the identification of novel therapeutic markers/targets remains a priority. The expression of eEF1A1 protein was determined in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate cancer and hyperplasia tissue by IHC. The role of eEF1A1 was investigated in a cellular model using a DNA aptamer (GT75) we previously developed. We used the aggressive CRPC cancer PC-3 and non-tumourigenic PZHPV-7 lines. Cytotoxicity was measured by the MTS assay and eEF1A1 protein levels by in-cell Western assays. The mRNA levels of eEF1A1 were measured by qPCR and ddPCR. Higher expression of eEF1A1 was found in Gleason 7-8 compared with 4-6 tissues (Gleason ≥ 7, 87% versus Gleason ≤ 6, 54%; p = 0.033). Patients with a high expression of eEF1A1 had a worse clinical outcome. In PC-3, but not in PZHPV-7, GT75 decreased cell viability and increased autophagy and cell detachment. In PC-3 cells, but not in PZHPV-7, GT75 mainly co-localised with the fraction of eEF1A1 bound to actin. Overexpression of the eEF1A1 protein can identify aggressive forms of prostate cancer. The targeting of eEF1A1 by GT75 impaired cell viability in PC-3 cancer cells but not in PZHPV-7 non-tumourigenic cells, indicating a specific role for the protein in cancer survival.

The BLG-modified amine-functionalized MCM-48 (MCM-BLG) nanoparticles were loaded with FBZ to produce the drug nanoformulation (FBZ-MCM-BLG) and improved the water solubility and, consequently, its anticancer effects against human prostate cancer PC-3 cells. The prepared FBZ-MCM-BLG was characterized in terms of size, zeta potential, drug loading capacity, morphology, thermal and chemical analyses, drug release, cellular uptake, cell viability, cell proliferation, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cell migration. The results demonstrated that the FBZ-MCM-BLG nanoparticles have a spherical morphology with a size and zeta potential of 369 ± 28 nm and 28 ± 0.4 mV, respectively. The drug loading efficiency of the new nanoformulation was 19%. The release of FBZ was pH-dependent; a maximum cumulative release of about 76 and 62% in 12 h and a burst release of 53 and 38% in the first 0.5 h was observed at pH 1.2 and 6.8, respectively. The prepared FBZ-MCM-BLG formulation demonstrated higher cytotoxicity effects against PC-3 cells by 5.6- and 1.8-fold, respectively, when compared to FBZ and FBZ-MCM nanoparticles. The new formulation also increased the production of ROS by 1.6- and 1.2-fold and inhibited the migration of PC-3 cells when compared to the FBZ and FBZ-MCM nanoparticles, respectively.

For most prostate cancer cells to grow, androgens need to bind to a cellular protein called the androgen receptor (AR). This study aims to demonstrate the expression of five microRNAs (miRs) and its influence on the AR formation in patients from the northern region of Brazil.  Material and methods:   Eighty-four tissue samples were investigated, including nodular prostatic hyperplasia (NPH) and acinar prostatic adenocarcinoma (CaP). Five miRs (27a-3p, 124, 130a, 488-3p, and 506) were quantified using the TaqMan® Real Time PCR method and AR was measured using Western blotting.  Results:   Levels of miRs 124, 130a, 488-3p, and 506 were higher in NPH samples. Conversely, in the CaP cases, higher levels of miR 27a-3p and AR were observed.

SnoRNA-derived fragments sdRNA-D19b and -A24 emerged among the most differentially expressed and were selected for further experimentation. We found that the overexpression of either sdRNA significantly increased PC3 (a well-established model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)) cell proliferation, and that sdRNA-D19b overexpression also markedly increased the rate of PC3 cell migration. In addition, both sdRNAs provided drug-specific resistances with sdRNA-D19b levels correlating with paclitaxel resistance and sdRNA-24A conferring dasatinib resistance. In silico and in vitro analyses revealed that two established PCa tumor suppressor genes, CD44 and CDK12, represent targets for sdRNA-D19b and sdRNA-A24, respectively. This outlines a biologically coherent mechanism by which sdRNAs downregulate tumor suppressors in AR-PCa to enhance proliferative and metastatic capabilities and to encourage chemotherapeutic resistance. Aggressive proliferation, rampant metastasis, and recalcitrance to chemotherapy are core characteristics of CRPC that synergize to produce a pathology that ranks second in cancer-related deaths for men.

The study's objective is to evaluate intake patterns of total alcohol and the three types of beverage (beer, wine, and spirits) by the PCa risk and aggressiveness status.  Method:   This is a cross-sectional study using 10,029 men (4676 non-PCa men and 5353 PCa patients) with European ancestry from the PCa consortium. Associations between PCa status and alcohol intake patterns (infrequent, light/moderate, and heavy) were tested using multinomial logistic regressions.  Results:   Intake frequency patterns of total alcohol were similar for non-PCa men and PCa patients after adjusting for demographic and other factors. However, PCa patients were more likely to drink wine (light/moderate, OR = 1.11, p = 0.018) and spirits (light/moderate, OR = 1.14, p = 0.003; and heavy, OR = 1.34, p = 0.04) than non-PCa men. Patients with aggressive PCa drank more beer than patients with non-aggressive PCa (heavy, OR = 1.48, p = 0.013). Interestingly, heavy wine intake was inversely associated with PCa aggressiveness (OR = 0.56, p = 0.009).  Conclusions:   The intake patterns of some alcoholic beverage types differed by PCa status.

The PAP-specific Sipuleucel-T vaccine, which was approved by the FDA in 2010, increases the Overall Survival (OS) by 4 months, but is extremely expensive. We have previously shown that a 15 amino accid (AA) PAP sequence-derived peptide could induce strong immune responses and delay the growth of murine TRAMP-C1 prostate tumors. We have now substituted one amino acid and elongated the sequence to include epitopes predicted to bind to several additional HLA haplotypes. Herein, we present the immunological properties of this 42mer-mutated PAP-derived sequence (MutPAP42mer).  Methods:   The presence of PAP-135-143 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells in the blood of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) was assessed by flow cytometry using Dextramer™ technology. HHDII/DR1 transgenic mice were immunized with mutated and non-mutated PAP-derived 42mer peptides in the presence of CAF®09 or CpG ODN1826 (TLR-9 agonist) adjuvants. Vaccine-induced immune responses were measured by assessing the proportion and functionality of splenic PAP-specific T cells in vitro.  Results:   PAP-135-143 epitope-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in the blood of patients with PCa and stimulation of PBMCs from patients with PCa with mutPAP42mer enhanced their capacity to kill human LNCaP PCa target cells expressing PAP. The MutPAP42mer peptide was significantly more immunogenic in HHDII/DR1 mice than the wild type sequence, and immunogenicity was further enhanced when combined with the CAF®09 adjuvant. The vaccine induced secretory (IFNγ and TNFα) and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and effector memory splenic T cells.  Conclusions:   The periphery of patients with PCa exhibits immune responsiveness to the MutPAP42mer peptide and immunization of mice induces/expands T cell-driven, wild-type PAP immunity, and therefore, has the potential to drive protective anti-tumor immunity in patients with PCa.""","""['Pauline Le Vu', 'Jayakumar Vadakekolathu', 'Sarra Idri', 'Holly Nicholls', 'Manon Cavaignac', 'Stephen Reeder', 'Masood A Khan', 'Dennis Christensen', 'Alan Graham Pockley', 'Stéphanie E McArdle']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Novel prostate acid phosphatase-based peptide vaccination strategy induces antigen-specific T-cell responses and limits tumour growth in mice.', 'Identification of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) specific HLA-DR1-restricted T-cell epitopes.', 'HLA-A2-restricted T-cell epitopes specific for prostatic acid phosphatase.', 'Sipuleucel-T: APC 8015, APC-8015, prostate cancer vaccine--Dendreon.', 'Efficacy Against Human Prostate Cancer by Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen-specific, Transforming Growth Factor-β Insensitive Genetically Targeted CD8+ T-cells Derived from Patients with Metastatic Castrate-resistant Disease.']"""

Previous studies established that high levels of SOX2 in both fetal and tumor cells restrict cell proliferation and induce a slowly cycling state. However, the mechanisms through which elevated SOX2 levels inhibit tumor cell proliferation have not been identified. To identify common mechanisms through which SOX2 elevation restricts tumor cell proliferation, we initially performed RNA-seq using two diverse tumor cell types. SOX2 elevation in both cell types downregulated MYC target genes. Consistent with these findings, elevating SOX2 in five cell lines representing three different human cancer types decreased MYC expression. Importantly, the expression of a dominant-negative MYC variant, omomyc, recapitulated many of the effects of SOX2 on proliferation, cell cycle, gene expression, and biosynthetic activity. We also demonstrated that rescuing MYC activity in the context of elevated SOX2 induces cell death, indicating that the downregulation of MYC is a critical mechanistic step necessary to maintain survival in the slowly cycling state induced by elevated SOX2. Altogether, our findings uncover a novel SOX2:MYC signaling axis and provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms through which SOX2 elevation induces a slowly cycling proliferative state.""","""['Ethan P Metz', 'Phillip J Wilder', 'Tessa M Popay', 'Jing Wang', 'Qi Liu', 'Achyuth Kalluchi', 'M Jordan Rowley', 'William P Tansey', 'Angie Rizzino']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Tumor quiescence: elevating SOX2 in diverse tumor cell types downregulates a broad spectrum of the cell cycle machinery and inhibits tumor growth.', 'Elevating SOX2 levels deleteriously affects the growth of medulloblastoma and glioblastoma cells.', 'C-MYC transcriptionally amplifies SOX2 target genes to regulate self-renewal in multipotent otic progenitor cells.', 'Therapeutic aspects of c-MYC signaling in inflammatory and cancerous colonic diseases.', 'Role of MYC in Medulloblastoma.', 'Targeting Myc-driven stress addiction in colorectal cancer.']"""

Although several studies have highlighted the diagnostic and prognostic role of circulating biomarkers, such as PSA, their measurement does not necessarily allow the detection of the disease. Within this context, many authors suggest that the evaluation of circulating polyamines could represent a valuable tool, although several analytical problems still counteract their clinical practice. In particular, agmatine seems particularly intriguing, being a potential inhibitor of polyamines commonly derived from arginine. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the potential role of agmatine as a suitable biomarker for the identification of different classes of patients with prostate cancer (PC). For this reason, three groups of human patients-benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), precancerous lesion (PL), and prostate cancer (PC)-were recruited from a cohort of patients with suspected prostate cancer (n = 170), and obtained plasma was tested using the LC-HRMS method. Statistics on the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC), and multivariate analysis were used to examine the predictive value of markers for discrimination among the three patient groups. Statistical analysis models revealed good discrimination using polyamine levels to distinguish the three classes of patients. AUC above 0.8, sensitivity ranging from 67% to 89%, specificity ranging from 74% to 89% and accuracy from 73% to 86%, considering the validation set, were achieved. Agmatine plasma levels were measured in PC (39.9 ± 12.06 ng/mL), BPH (77.62 ± 15.05 ng/mL), and PL (53.31 ± 15.27 ng/mL) patients. ROC analysis of the agmatine panel showed an AUC of 0.959 and p ≤ 0.001. These results could represent a future tool able to discriminate patients belonging to the three different clinical groups.""","""['Donatella Coradduzza', 'Tatiana Solinas', 'Emanuela Azara', 'Nicola Culeddu', 'Sara Cruciani', 'Angelo Zinellu', 'Serenella Medici', 'Margherita Maioli', 'Massimo Madonia', 'Ciriaco Carru']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['Urinary Polyamines: A Pilot Study on Their Roles as Prostate Cancer Detection Biomarkers.', 'Combinations of serum prostate-specific antigen and plasma expression levels of let-7c, miR-30c, miR-141, and miR-375 as potential better diagnostic biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Improved discrimination of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia by means of the quotient of free and total PSA.', 'Molecular forms of serum prostate-specific antigen: the clinical usefulness of percent free PSA to discriminate prostate cancer from BPH.', 'Tumor markers.

New liquid biopsy-based screening tests, including multi-cancer early detection (MCED) tests, are creating a need to reduce the typically lengthy screening trial process. Endpoints based on the reduction in late-stage disease (stage shift) have been proposed but it is unclear how well they predict the impact of screening on disease-specific mortality across a variety of cancers potentially detectable by MCED tests.  Methods:   We develop a mathematical formulation relating the reduction in late-stage cancer to the expected reduction in disease-specific mortality if cases diagnosed early via screening receive a corresponding shift in mortality. We investigate the similarity between the expected mortality reduction and the observed mortality reduction in published trials of screening for breast, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer.  Results:   The expected mortality reduction for a given stage shift varies significantly depending on cancer- and stage-specific survival distributions, with some cancer types showing little possibility for mortality improvement even under substantial stage shift. The expected mortality reduction fails to consistently match the mortality outcomes of published trials.  Conclusions:   In MCED, any mortality benefit is likely to vary substantially across target cancers. Stage shift does not appear to be a reliable basis for inference about mortality reduction across cancers potentially detectable by MCED tests.  Impact:   Stage shift may be an appealing endpoint for evaluation of cancer screening tests but it appears to be an unreliable predictor of mortality benefit; furthermore, the same stage shift can mean different things for different cancers.""","""['Lukas Owens', 'Roman Gulati', 'Ruth Etzioni']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Short-term Endpoints for Cancer Screening Trials: Does Tumor Subtype Matter?', 'The Potential Value-Based Price of a Multi-Cancer Early Detection Genomic Blood Test to Complement Current Single Cancer Screening in the USA.', 'Estimating the population health impact of a multi-cancer early detection genomic blood test to complement existing screening in the US and UK.', 'Multicancer Early Detection Technologies: A Review Informed by Past Cancer Screening Studies.', 'Study design considerations for trials to evaluate multicancer early detection assays for clinical utility.', 'Short-term Endpoints for Cancer Screening Trials: Does Tumor Subtype Matter?', 'Dying To Find Out: The Cost of Time at the Dawn of the Multicancer Early Detection Era.']"""

Metastases to the spine result in fractures, pain, paralysis, and significant health care costs. This predilection for cancer to metastasize to the bone is seen across most cancer histologies, with the greatest incidence seen in prostate, breast, and lung cancer. The molecular process involved in this predilection for axial versus appendicular skeleton is not fully understood, although it is likely that a combination of tumor and local micro-environmental factors plays a role. Immune cells are an important constituent of the bone marrow microenvironment and many of these cells have been shown to play a significant role in tumor growth and progression in soft tissue and bone disease. With this in mind, we sought to examine the differences in immune landscape between axial and appendicular bones in the normal noncancerous setting in order to obtain an understanding of these landscapes. To accomplish this, we utilized mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF) to examine differences in the immune cell landscapes between the long bone and vertebral body bone marrow from patient clinical samples and C57BL/6J mice. We demonstrate significant differences between immune populations in both murine and human marrow with a predominance of myeloid progenitor cells in the spine. Additionally, cytokine analysis revealed differences in concentrations favoring a more myeloid enriched population of cells in the vertebral body bone marrow.

We sought to characterize HRR gene variants and describe real-world outcomes for patients on PARPi.  Methods:   The US Department of Veterans Affairs' National Precision Oncology Program's database was reviewed to identify patients who underwent somatic DNA sequencing and were prescribed a PARPi before May 15, 2020. Somatic and germline variants within HRR genes were reported, and pathogenicity was reviewed via OncoKB. In patients treated with PARPi for > 4 weeks, the rate of those achieving a 30% decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA30) and composite progression-free survival (PFS) were compared between patients bearing pathogenic variants of BRCA2 and patients without these variants using Mann-Whitney and log-rank tests, respectively.  Results:   Forty-eight patients bearing 67 total HRR gene variants were prescribed PARPi for prostate cancer. Twenty-one patients (43.8%) were found to have at least one pathogenic HRR gene variant. Eight (16.6%) were referred to genetic counseling, and five (10.4%) were ultimately confirmed with germline variants. The median PFS was 4.0 months, and PSA30 was 25.6% (11 of 43) for all 43 evaluable patients.

Here, we examined the effect of a small-molecule MYC inhibitor, MYCi975, on the MYC/MAX cistromes, epigenome, transcriptome, and tumorigenesis. Integrating these data revealed three major classes of MYCi975-modulated gene targets: type 1 (down-regulated), type 2 (up-regulated), and type 3 (unaltered). While cell cycle and signal transduction pathways were heavily targeted by MYCi, RNA biogenesis and core transcriptional pathway genes were spared. MYCi975 altered chromatin binding of MYC and the MYC network family proteins, and chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation alterations revealed MYCi975 suppression of MYC-regulated lineage factors AR/ARv7, FOXA1, and FOXM1. Consequently, MYCi975 synergistically sensitized resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells to 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

Objective:   To assess patterns of use of PBT according to the present American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) clinical indications in the US.  Design, setting, and participants:   Individuals newly diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2018 were selected from the National Cancer Database. Data analysis was performed from October 4, 2021, to February 22, 2022. ASTRO's Model Policies (2017) were used to classify patients into group 1, for which health insurance coverage for PBT treatment is recommended, and group 2, for which coverage is recommended only if additional requirements are met.  Main outcomes and measures:   Use of PBT.  Results:   Of the 5 919 368 patients eligible to receive PBT included in the study, 3 206 902 were female (54.2%), and mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 62.6 (12.3) years. Use of PBT in the US increased from 0.4% in 2004 to 1.2% in 2018 (annual percent change [APC], 8.12%; P < .001) due to increases in group 1 from 0.4% in 2010 to 2.2% in 2018 (APC, 21.97; P < .001) and increases in group 2 from 0.03% in 2014 to 0.1% in 2018 (APC, 30.57; P < .001). From 2010 to 2018, among patients in group 2, PBT targeted to the breast increased from 0.0% to 0.9% (APC, 51.95%), and PBT targeted to the lung increased from 0.1% to 0.7% (APC, 28.06%) (P < .001 for both). Use of PBT targeted to the prostate decreased from 1.4% in 2011 to 0.8% in 2014 (APC, -16.48%; P = .03) then increased to 1.3% in 2018 (APC, 12.45; P < .001). Most patients in group 1 treated with PBT had private insurance coverage in 2018 (1039 [55.4%]); Medicare was the most common insurance type among those in group 2 (1973 [52.5%]).  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this study show an increase in the use of PBT in the US between 2004 to 2018; prostate was the only cancer site for which PBT use decreased temporarily between 2011 and 2014, increasing again between 2014 and 2018.

The second goal was to make the AI-based method available to other researchers.  Methods:   [18F]PSMA PET-CT scans were collected from 211 patients. Suspected pelvic lymph node metastases were marked by three independent readers. A CNN was developed and trained on a training and validation group of 161 of the patients. The performance of the AI method and the inter-observer agreement between the three readers were assessed in a separate test group of 50 patients.  Results:   The sensitivity of the AI method for detecting pelvic lymph node metastases was 82%, and the corresponding sensitivity for the human readers was 77% on average. The average number of false positives was 1.8 per patient. A total of 5-17 false negative lesions in the whole cohort were found, depending on which reader was used as a reference. The method is available for researchers at www.recomia.org .  Conclusion:   This study shows that AI can obtain a sensitivity on par with that of physicians with a reasonable number of false positives. The difficulty in achieving high inter-observer sensitivity emphasizes the need for automated methods. On the road to qualifying AI tools for clinical use, independent validation is critical and allows performance to be assessed in studies from different hospitals.

Patients and methods:   Forty-nine consecutive patients who were referred for trans rectal prostate biopsy were tested. Patients who received antibiotics 3 months prior to the biopsy, patients with history of pelvic irradiation, prostate or colon cancer, inflammatory bowel disease and urinary tract infection were excluded. A rectal swab was obtained just prior to the biopsy, immediately placed in a sterile tube and kept in -80°C. Sequencing was performed for the 16S rRNA 515F + 806R gene fragment using the QIIME2 software. Analytic tests included Beta diversity (Weighted Unifrac, Unweighted Unifrac, Bray-Curtis), Alpha diversity (Faith, Evenness), Taxa bar plots and PCoA plots.  Results:   Forty-five samples were suitable for analysis with at least 8000 readings per sample. All patients were Caucasian. Twenty patients had prostate cancer and 25 had benign prostates (BPH). Among prostate cancer patients, Gleason Score was 3 + 3 in 11 patients, 3 + 4 in 5, 4 + 3 in 3, and 4 + 4 in 2. There was no statistical difference in demographic parameters between the groups. We identified over 1000 bacterial species, typical for the colonic microbiome. No significant differences in bacterial populations were found between prostate cancer versus benign prostate patients nor between age groups or between subgroups of Gleason or International Society of Uro-pathology (ISUP) scores.  Conclusions:   Although the microbiome has previously been shown to have an impact on the human microenvironment and cancer risk, we could not demonstrate a significant difference between the flora diversity of newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and BPH patients.

Data were reported on (i) surgical complications, (ii) feasibility of sRP reported by surgeons, (iii) time interval between IRE and sRP and pathology results, and (iv) urinary continence, erectile function, and quality of life.  Results:   In four participating centres, a total of 39 patients with a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 64 (60-67) years were identified. No serious adverse events occurred during or following sRP and surgery was deemed feasible without difficulties. The median (IQR) time to recurrence following IRE was 14.3 (9.1-38.8) months. Pathology results showed localised disease in 21 patients (53.8%) and locally-advanced disease in 18 (46.2%). Positive surgical margins (PSMs) were observed in 10 patients (25.6%), of which six (15.4%) had significant PSMs. A persistent detectable prostate-specific antigen level was found in one case after sRP, caused by metastatic disease. One patient had a biochemical recurrence 6 months after sRP. These two cases, together with a PSM case, required additional therapy after sRP. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 17.7 (11.8-26.4) months, urinary continence and erectile function were preserved in 34 (94.4%) and 18 patients (52.9%), respectively, while quality of life remained stable.

Apigenin (Api) is a natural plant-derived flavonoid with potent antiproliferative and antimigration effects.  Objectives:   We aimed to investigate the possible role of Api in combination with the androgen receptor inhibitor AA in the treatment of androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer LNCaP cells.  Methods:   The cells were either exposed to 10 μM AA, 25 μM Api, or in combination for 48 hours, then the viability rate was determined by the MTT test, whilst apoptosis and cell cycle phases were assessed by image-based cytometry. The expression of selected mRNA and proteins were evaluated by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively.  Results:   The combination of AA and Api significantly inhibited LNCaP as well as androgen-insensitive PC3 cell survival in a manner more marked than observed with either single treatment. Co-administration of Api with AA triggered apoptosis. This effect was demonstrated by Hoechst staining, and up-regulation of Bax, cytochrome c, caspase -3, and - 8 and down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression confirmed the effect. AA and Api each individually arrested the cell cycle in the G1 phase, with dual applications, leading to no further increase in the effect produced. The expression of NF-κB p105/p50 and the phosphorylation of AKT markedly decreased after apigenin treatment, with combination treatment leading to a favourable effect in terms of further augmenting the reduction.  Conclusion:   The co-administration of Api with AA strongly enhanced the efficacy of AA therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer cells.

The perioperative and pathologic data along with functional and oncologic outcomes for a period of 3 years were compared between groups. Results: Compared with TURP-naive patients, prior TURP patients experienced longer robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy times (p < 0.001), increased incidence of bladder neck reconstruction (p = 0.03), greater blood loss (p = 0.0001), and lesser nerve sparing (p < 0.01).

Meanwhile, assigning a Gleason grade to IDC-P remains controversial.  Objective.—:   To assess the clinical significance of necrosis associated with IDC-P.  Design.—:   We compared radical prostatectomy (RP) findings and oncologic outcomes in men with prostate cancer exhibiting IDC-P with (IDC-P+/N+) versus without (IDC-P+/N-) comedonecrosis.  Results.—:   Of the 558 RPs examined, IDC-P was present in 213 cases (38.2%), including 167 (78.4%) with IDC-P+/N- and 46 (21.6%) with IDC-P+/N+. When comparing IDC-P+/N- versus IDC-P+/N+ cases, the presence of necrosis was significantly associated with higher tumor grade, higher incidence of pT3/pT3b or pN1 disease, and larger estimated tumor volume. Outcome analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of disease progression in IDC-P+/N+ patients than in IDC-P+/N- patients (P < .001). Significant differences in progression-free survival between IDC-P+/N- and IDC-P+/N+ patients were also seen in subgroups, such as those without (P = .01) or with (P = .03) adjuvant therapy immediately after RP, those with pN0 disease (P < .001), and, more interestingly, those exhibiting conventional Gleason pattern 5 component (P = .02).

Little is known about the response to loss of activity resulting from such changes. Our aim was to understand perceptions of loss in response to centralization of cancer services in England, where 12 sites offering specialist surgery were reduced to four, and to understand the impact of leadership and management on enabling or hampering coping strategies associated with that loss.  Methods:   We analysed 115 interviews with clinical, nursing and managerial staff from oesophago-gastric, prostate/bladder and renal cancer services in London and West Essex. In addition, we used 134 hours of observational data and analysis from over 100 documents to contextualize and to interpret the interview data. We performed a thematic analysis drawing on stress-coping theory and organizational change.  Results:   Staff perceived that, during centralization, sites were devalued as the sites lost surgical activity, skills and experienced teams. Staff members believed that there were long-term implications for this loss, such as in retaining high-calibre staff, attracting trainees and maintaining autonomy. Emotional repercussions for staff included perceived loss of status and motivation. To mitigate these losses, leaders in the centralization process put in place some instrumental measures, such as joint contracting, surgical skill development opportunities and trainee rotation. However, these measures were undermined by patchy implementation and negative impacts on some individuals (e.g. increased workload or travel time). Relatively little emotional support was perceived to be offered. Leaders sometimes characterized adverse emotional reactions to the centralization as resistance, to be overcome through persuasion and appeals to the success of the new system.  Conclusions:   Large-scale reorganizations are likely to provoke a high degree of emotion and perceptions of loss.

After RP, patients may require endoscopic urethral procedures (EUP) for other urological diseases such as hematuria, urinary system stone disease, and suspicion of bladder tumor. In clinical practice we observed that EUP performed after robot assisted RP (RARP) can cause an increase in the UI level. In this study, we investigated whether there is a change in the UI level in patients that underwent EUP after RARP and whether this change was affected by the duration of the procedure and type of endoscopic device used.  Material and methods:   Twenty-six patients were included who underwent EUP after RARP in this study. The patients were divided into three groups based on the endoscopic device used: group 1 rigid cystoscopy (n = 9), group 2 flexible cystoscopy (n = 7), and group 3 semi-rigid ureterorenoscopy (URS) (n = 10). The Turkish version of the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and the number of pads used daily was questioned before the EUP and 1 month after the procedure.  Results:   While a significant increase in ICIQ-SF score was observed in group 1 (p = 0.027), no significant increase was observed in group 2 and group 3 (p > 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the number of pads used preoperatively and the postoperative first month in all groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant correlation between increased operation time and both the pad usage and ICIQ-SF score (p > 0.05).

However, there are few studies quantifying these increased costs. OBJECTIVE: To estimate overall health care resource utilization and costs associated with progression to metastatic disease in Medicare or commercially insured patients with nonmetastatic castration-sensitive PC (nmCSPC) or previously undiagnosed PC. METHODS: In this retrospective, observational cohort study, we used data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial and MarketScan Medicare Supplemental Databases. Included patients were aged 18 years or older, had 2 or more health care claims associated with a diagnosis of PC, and had a diagnosis of metastatic disease (index date) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016. Patients with PC were identified at index as either progressing from a localized disease state (nmCSPC) without evidence of castration resistance (progressors) or de novo metastatic without a prior PC diagnosis. Unadjusted all-cause direct health care costs for the 2-year pre-index period and up to 2 years post-index were summarized. Metastasis-related incremental all-cause direct health care costs were estimated using regression modeling to adjust for patient baseline characteristics, follow-up duration, and possible selection bias. RESULTS: We identified 3,854 patients who met the criteria for CSPC at metastasis: 2,766 Medicare patients (mean age 78.8 ± 7.6 years) and 1,088 commercial patients (mean age 57.6 ± 4.3 years), with de novo patients accounting for 28.9% and 34.5% of the 2 analysis populations, respectively. Mean unadjusted total all-cause health care costs over the 24-month pre-index period among progressors were $52,661 (Medicare) and $43,111 (commercial); those among de novo patients were $39,756 (Medicare) and $22,090 (commercial). Mean unadjusted post-index costs for progressors were $100,331 (Medicare) and $127,374 (commercial) over a mean follow-up duration of 14.63 and 18.41 months, respectively, and $124,538 (Medicare) and $173,408 (commercial) over a mean follow-up duration of 14.14 and 17.29 months for patients with de novo disease. After multivariate adjustment, incremental cost increases due to metastasis in patients with CSPC pre-index were estimated at $104,051 (Medicare) and $93,334 (commercial), assuming data are available for 24 months post-index. Allowing for variation in the postindex observation period, estimates were $71,308 (Medicare) and $82,336 (commercial). Among de novo patients, cost increases due to metastasis were estimated at $180,932 (Medicare) and $215,397 (commercial), assuming all patients have data for 24 months postindex. Allowing for variable follow-up, estimates were $113,253 (Medicare) and $161,714 (commercial). CONCLUSIONS: Development of metastatic CSPC is associated with considerable costs over a 24-month follow-up period. Cost increases are greater for de novo patients than for those who progressed from localized disease. DISCLOSURES: Q.-D.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the magnetic resonance imaging features of STUMPs.  Methods:   A total of 12 patients with STUMP confirmed with pathology who underwent MRI from 2012 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. Pathological characteristics including histopathology and immunohistochemistry were also recorded.  Results:   Among 12 STUMPs, the tumours were detected in the peripheral zone (41.7%[n = 5]) and transitional zone (58.3% [n = 7]) of the prostate. 8 cases (66.7%) were round shape. All lesions were well-defined and compressed the adjacent structures but without signs of an invasion. Homogeneous T1WI and heterogeneous T2WI signals were observed in the STUMPs. The tumours were mainly composed of solid components, while intratumoral cystic change (58.3%[n = 7]) and haemorrhage (8.3%[n = 1]) were seen. 10 cases(83.3%) were seen as relatively high DWI signal, while 2 cases(16.7%) with no increase in DWI. The mean ADC value was 1.084 ± 0.193 (range: 0.864-1.489 × 10-3 mm2 /s). STUMPs had heterogeneous enhancement, with persistent or gradual enhancement. In immunohistochemical staining, Vim, CD34, PR and SMA were positive in the majority of STUMPs.  Conclusion:   MRI features of STUMP are presented as regular, well-defined and isolated prostatic mass with intact pseudocapsule. The presence of heterogeneous T2WI signal, intratumoral cystic change, slightly low mean ADC value and persistent or gradual enhancement may help predict the STUMPs.""","""['Yi Liu#', 'Jingyun Wu#', 'Qi Shen', 'Derun Li', 'Zhisong He', 'Liqun Zhou', 'Jiangxi Xiao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol""","""['A clinical analysis of 14 cases of prostatic stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential.', 'The value of relaxation time quantitative technique from synthetic magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and invasion assessment of prostate cancer.', 'Clinicopathological features to distinguish malignant solitary fibrous tumors of the prostate from prostatic stromal tumors.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion-weighted MRI of the prostate.']"""

Thus, patients need guidance towards safe and healthy use of CAM. According to published results, open dialogue about CAM (OD-CAM) between health professionals and patients as an integral part of anticancer treatment may improve patients' quality of life and well-being. Since the literature on the issue is sparse, the aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of OD-CAM integrated early in conventional oncology treatment versus standard care (SC) in patients undergoing standard anticancer treatment.  Methods and analysis:   The study is a randomised controlled trial, being conducted at an oncology outpatient clinic in Denmark. 207 patients undergoing curative or palliative oncology treatment for breast, gynaecological, prostate, pulmonary, colorectal, anal or pancreatic cancer will be randomly assigned to SC with or without OD-CAM. A nurse specialist will facilitate the OD-CAM in one or two sessions. The primary endpoint is patient reported quality of life in relation to psychological well-being 8 weeks after enrollment. Secondary endpoints are patient reported level of depression and anxiety, top concerns, and decision regret 8, 12 and 24 weeks after enrolment, and overall survival.

Excellent soft-tissue visualisation offered by magnetic resonance image-guided radiotherapy (MRIgRT) provides an opportunity to better understand such changes. The aim of this study was to quantify prostate volume and dimension changes occurring during extreme and moderately hypofractionated schedules.  Materials and methods:   Forty prostate cancer patients treated on the Unity 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance linear accelerator (MRL) were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort comprised patients treated with 36.25 Gy in five fractions (n = 20) and 60 Gy in 20 fractions (n = 20). The volume of the delineated prostates on reference planning computed tomography (fused with MRI) and daily T2-weighted 2-min session images acquired on Unity were charted. Forty planning computed tomography and 500 MRL prostate volumes were evaluated. The mean absolute and relative change in prostate volume during radiotherapy was compared using a paired t-test (P value <0.01 considered significant to control for multiple comparisons). The maximum dimension of the delineated prostate was measured in three isocentric planes.  Results:   Significant prostate volume changes, relative to MRL imaging fraction 1 (MRL#1), were seen at all time points for the five-fraction group. The peak mean relative volume increase was 21% (P < 0.001), occurring at MRL#3 and MRL#4 after 14.5 and 21.75 Gy, respectively. Prostate expansion was greatest in the superior-inferior direction; the peak mean maximal extension was 5.9 mm. The maximal extension in the left-right and anterior-posterior directions measured 1.1 and 2.2 mm, respectively. For the 20-fraction group, prostate volume increased relative to MRL#1, for all treatment time points. The mean relative volume increase was 11% (P < 0.001) at MRL#5 after 12 Gy, it then fluctuated between 8 and 13%. From MRL#5 to MRL#20, the volume increase was significant (P < 0.01) for 12 of 16 time points calculated. The peak mean maximal extension in the superior-inferior direction was 3.1 mm. The maximal extension in the left-right and anterior-posterior directions measured 1.7 and 3.7 mm, respectively.  Conclusion:   Significant prostate volume and dimension changes occur during extreme and moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy. The extent of change was greater during extreme hypofractionation.

Objective:   To perform a network meta-analysis (NMA) of relevant randomized trials to compare the relative benefits of RT dose escalation ± STADT or LTADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   An NMA of individual patient data from 13 multicenter randomized trials was carried out for a total of 11862 patients. Patients received one of the six permutations of low-dose RT (64 to <74 Gy) ± STADT or LTADT, high-dose RT (≥74 Gy), or high-dose RT ± STADT or LTADT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analyses:   Metastasis-free survival (MFS) was the primary endpoint. Frequentist and Bayesian NMAs were performed to rank the various treatment strategies by MFS and biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS).  Results and limitations:   Median follow-up was 8.8 yr (interquartile range 5.7-11.5). The greatest relative improvement in outcomes was seen for addition of LTADT, irrespective of RT dose, followed by addition of STADT, irrespective of RT dose. RT dose escalation did not improve MFS either in the absence of ADT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-1.18) or with STADT (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.8-1.23) or LTADT (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.65-1.37). According to P-score ranking and rankogram analysis, high-dose RT + LTADT was the optimal treatment strategy for both BCRFS and longer-term outcomes.  Conclusions:   Conventionally escalated RT up to 79.2 Gy, alone or in the presence of ADT, does not improve MFS, while addition of STADT or LTADT to RT alone, regardless of RT dose, consistently improves MFS. RT dose escalation does provide a high probability of improving BCRFS and, provided it can be delivered without compromising quality of life, may represent the optimal treatment strategy when used in conjunction with ADT.  Patient summary:   Using a higher radiotherapy dose when treating prostate cancer does not reduce the chance of developing metastases or death, but it does reduce the chance of having a rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) signifying recurrence of cancer. Androgen deprivation therapy improves all outcomes.

This study compared the cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide versus apalutamide versus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) alone (standard of care) in patients with mCSPC from the Canadian public payer perspective using a Markov model with a 15-year time horizon.  Materials and methods:   Efficacy data for enzalutamide and ADT alone were informed by the ARCHES and ENZAMET clinical trials, while a Bayesian network meta-analysis enabled comparison with apalutamide and ADT alone.  Results:   Over the 15-year period, enzalutamide achieved the highest number of life-years (LY, 7.6) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY, 5.62) compared with apalutamide (LY, 6.1; QALY, 4.59) and ADTs (LY, 4.9; QALY, 3.61). Enzalutamide incurred the most costs ($349,345) compared with apalutamide ($294,349) and ADT ($162,550). Sequential analysis showed that enzalutamide lies on the cost-effectiveness frontier with ADT alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $92,868/QALY), with apalutamide extendedly dominated through enzalutamide and ADT alone.  Limitations:   Limitations include the heterogeneity of the studies included in the network meta-analysis and the validations for the treatment sequencing assumptions in the modeling.

However, PC screening may be associated with overdiagnosis and complications of unnecessary treatment for indolent disease. Therefore, careful patient selection for PC screening is critical to avoid overestimation and missed diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess physicians' knowledge and attitude towards early detection of PC in Jordan and whether their knowledge is an important predictor of their attitude. An electronic, self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, knowledge, and attitude of physicians regarding early detection of PC. The participants' responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. Around 296 physicians agreed to participate in this study. Most respondents were males (75.7%), residents (34%), practiced medicine more than 15 years (29%) and graduated (81.4%) from local universities. Surprisingly, only 28.4% recognized PC as a non-self-detected disease and less than one-half (48.6%) were aware that PC screening tests are not enough to exclude a diagnosis of PC. The median knowledge Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) score was 59%. Around two-thirds of participants showed a positive attitude towards early detection of PC (median attitude POMP score was 66%). Higher attitude scores were significantly associated with younger age, those working in private hospitals, and those having higher knowledge POMP score (P < .05). This study highlighted that most physicians demonstrated a positive attitude towards PC screening but with moderate level of knowledge that is considered an important predictor of their attitude towards PC early detection. Thus, improving knowledge and awareness of physicians should be considered as a strategy to improve their attitude towards prostate screening practices and informing men of the importance of regular screening.""","""['Mohammad A Y Alqudah', 'Raneem Al-Samman', 'Obada Matalgah', 'Rana Abu Farhah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Inquiry""","""['Knowledge and attitudes of pharmacists towards colorectal cancer health education in Jordan: A cross-sectional study.', 'Awareness of general public towards cancer prostate and screening practice in Arabic communities: a comparative multi-center study.', 'Knowledge and Attitudes towards Prostate Cancer and Screening among Males in Limpopo Province, South Africa.', 'Knowledge and attitude of the population toward cancer prostate Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Knowledge, attitude and practice on screening and early diagnosis of prostate cancer of primary health care providers in the Free State.', 'Investigation of awareness rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) among the general public in China and analysis of influencing factors.']"""

Associations between HHV-8 and prostate cancer were assessed in multivariable unconditional logistic regression models. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (OR) and stratified the analysis into men harboring the IFNL4-ΔG-variant and non-carriers (ΔG/ΔG or ΔG/TT vs. TT/TT).  Results:   HHV-8 seropositivity was higher in cases than controls (11% vs. 6%) and this association was restricted to carriers of the ΔG allele (OR 2.19: 95% CI:1.38-3.48) in both African American (OR 1.96; 95% CI:1.08-3.56) and European American men (OR 2.59; 95% CI:1.20-5.56).

Most of available literature is about HBoV in children and adults with hematological malignancies and in otherwise healthy children with respiratory infections. Information regarding infection in the adult population with solid tumors is scarce. Case Report: We report the case of a 51-year-old male with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer undergoing chemotherapy treatment who presented with fever, dyspnea, dry cough, and pleuritic pain. Imaging techniques showed signs of congestive heart failure. Symptoms, laboratory tests and echocardiography revealed a more probable infectious etiology. Antibiotic therapy was started. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal exudate for respiratory viruses was positive for HBoV. The rest of the microbiological tests were negative. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed. Bacterial culture of BAL was negative while respiratory virus PCR confirmed positivity for HBoV. Antibiotic therapy was discontinued. The patient gradually recovered. Conclusions: Emerging infectious diseases are a notorious threat for immunocompromised populations such as solid tumor patients. This case is unique because to our knowledge this is the first case report article of HBoV in a solid tumor patient and because imaging techniques exhibited signs of congestive heart failure that did not correlate with the rest of the tests.

Therefore, disease-specific models are needed to estimate patient survival. Our primary aim was to develop models to estimate survival duration after treatment for skeletal-related events (SREs) (symptomatic bone metastasis, including impending or actual pathologic fractures) in men with metastatic bone disease due to prostate cancer. Such disease-specific models could be added to the PATHFx clinical-decision support tool, which is available worldwide, free of charge. Our secondary aim was to determine disease-specific factors that should be included in an international cancer registry.  Methods:   We analyzed records of 438 men with metastatic prostate cancer who sustained SREs that required treatment with radiotherapy or surgery from 1989-2017. We developed and validated 6 models for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 10-year survival after treatment. Model performance was evaluated using calibration analysis, Brier scores, area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), and decision curve analysis to determine the models' clinical utility. We characterized the magnitude and direction of model features.  Results:   The models exhibited acceptable calibration, accuracy (Brier scores < 0.20), and classification ability (AUCs > 0.73). Decision curve analysis determined that all 6 models were suitable for clinical use. The order of feature importance was distinct for each model. In all models, 3 factors were positively associated with survival duration: younger age at metastasis diagnosis, proximal prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 10 ng/mL, and slow-rising alkaline phosphatase velocity (APV).  Conclusions:   We developed models that estimate survival duration in patients with metastatic bone disease due to prostate cancer. These models require external validation but should meanwhile be included in the PATHFx tool.

Since it is a challenging process, we sought to develop a protocol that improves the fidelity and quantity of biobanked primary prostate cancer (CaP) tissue.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a pilot study evaluating pathologic concordance of biobanked tissue and the radical prostatectomy specimen using either standard protocol (SP) vs. next-generation protocol (NGP).  Results:   There were no significant differences in clinical and pathologic characteristics (age, BMI, preoperative PSA, prostate weight, race, final prostatectomy Gleason score, or pathologic tumor and nodal stages) between the two protocol arms. Utilization of the NGP compared to the standard protocol resulted in a significantly higher rate of pathologic concordance between the biobanked and RP specimens (61.8% vs. 37.9%, P = 0.0231) as well as a nearly two-fold increase in the amount of biobanked tumor tissue (330 mm3 vs. 174 mm3, P < 0.001). When looking at relevant clinical and pathologic characteristics, NGP was associated with pathologic concordance on both univariate [OR 2.65 (95% CI 1.13-6.21), P = 0.025] and multivariate analysis [OR 3.11 (95% CI 1.09-8.88), P = 0.034].  Conclusions:   Our study validates the NGP as a multidisciplinary approach for improving the fidelity and amount of biobanked primary CaP tissue for future studies. Given the challenges to banking tissue from primary CaP as tumors are often difficult to visualize grossly and are frequently multifocal, optimizing the fidelity and volume of biobanked tissue is an important step forward to improve the generalizability of genomic data as we move towards precision medicine.""","""['Peter Y Cai', 'Muhammad Asad', 'Michael A Augello', 'Laura Martin', 'Christopher Louie', 'Spyridon P Basourakos', 'Christopher D Gaffney', 'Jonathan Shoag', 'Jiangling Jenny Tu', 'Francesca Khani', 'Juan Miguel Mosquera', 'Massimo Loda', 'Douglas S Scherr', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Brian D Robinson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Concordance between Gleason scores of needle biopsies and radical prostatectomy specimens: a population-based study.', 'Optimizing patient selection for prostate monotherapy.', 'Clinical and pathologic outcome after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer patients with a preoperative Gleason sum of 8 to 10.', 'Biobanking after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a quality assessment of providing prostate tissue for RNA studies.', 'DNA ploidy and prostate-specific antigen as prognostic factors in clinically resectable prostate cancer.', 'Distinct mesenchymal cell states mediate prostate cancer progression.']"""

Asparagus, a widely consumed savory vegetable, is a rich source of antioxidants, saponins, vitamins, and minerals. In recent years, it has been shown that components of asparagus have anticancer effects on endometrial adenocarcinoma, and in prostate, breast, and colon cancer. In pancreatic cancer, it has been shown to have an anticancer effect on the KLM1-R cell line. This study was designed to investigate if asparagus extract (AE) had any effect on the growth of a widely used pancreatic cancer cell line MDAPanc-28 and to elucidate possible molecular mechanisms behind it.  Materials and methods:   Clonogenic survival assay, proliferation, and caspase-3 activity kits were used to evaluate the effects of AE on cell survival, proliferation, and apoptosis pathway of MDAPanc-28 cells. We further investigated the possible molecular mechanisms by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.  Results:   The colony numbers and proliferation of MDAPanc-28 cells were surprisingly increased when treated with AE. The relative caspase-3 activity in cancer cells decreased when they were treated with AE. The pro-proliferative effect of AE on MDAPanc-28 cells correlated with down-regulation of anti-proliferative molecules P21 and P53. The potential anti-apoptotic effect of AE correlated with down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic molecule Fas cell surface death receptor (FAS) and down-regulation of caspase-3 activity.

We also evaluated the effect of the rectal immobilization system Rectafix on quality of life (QoL).  Patients and methods:   Seventy-three patients with one or two intermediate prostate cancer risk factors according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria were recruited.

Their QoL data were assessed with regard to genitourinary, gastrointestinal and sexual wellbeing at the beginning and end of RT and at 3 months after treatment. Rectafix was used in the 78/2 Gy and 60/3 Gy groups.  Results:   There were no statistically significant QoL differences in between the treatment groups 3 months after RT. The 78/2 Gy group had significantly increased bowel movements between baseline and 3 months after RT (p=0.036). At 3 months after RT, this group also had significantly more erectile dysfunction than the 60/3 Gy group (p=0.025). At the end of RT, the 78/2 Gy group had more symptoms than the 36.25/7.25 Gy group. Rectafix did not reduce acute toxicities in the 78/2 Gy or 60/3 Gy groups.  Conclusion:   Treatment with the 78/2 Gy schedule is no longer to be recommended due to its increased acute toxicity compared to treatments of 60/3 Gy and 36.25/7.25 Gy.

It plays an essential role in the peripheral formation of androgens and is implicated in several steroid hormone dependent diseases including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). AKR1C3 has 14 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) with different global frequencies and ethnic distributions. Association studies support their role in disease, but a detailed functional genomic analysis of these variants is lacking. One study examined five AKR1C3 nsSNPs for their ability to reduce exemestane, an aromatase inhibitor used to treat breast cancer, to 17β-dihydroexemestane, and reported a 17-250-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency of H5Q, E77G, K104D, and R258C variants compared to wild type (WT). This observation provided the impetus to examine the impact of these variants on AKR1C3 function. Here, we purified AKR1C3 WT, and the top four most frequently occurring nsSNPs, H5Q, E77G, K104D, and R258C, from E. coli to expand upon their characterization and illuminate functional differences that could affect disease outcome and treatment. While we found negligible deviations in steady state kinetics, the K104D variant showed reduced thermal stability compared to WT. The presence of NAD(P)+ restored the stability of the variant.

Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as any Gleason grade group ≥2 cancer. Of 545 patients who underwent MRI fusion-targeted biopsy, 222 (40.7%) were biopsy naïve, 247 (45.3%) had previous prostate biopsy(s), and 76 (13.9%) had known prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance. Prostate cancer was more commonly found in biopsy-naïve men (63.5%) and those on active surveillance (68.4%) compared to those who had previous biopsies (35.2%; both P < 0.001). Systematic biopsies provided an incremental 10.4% detection of csPCa among biopsy-naïve patients, versus an incremental 2.4% among those who had prior negative biopsies.

Methods:   We analyzed the correlation between the expression of FOXO3a and the antioxidant enzyme catalase in prostate cancer with the TCGA and GEPIA databases. We also constructed a PPI network of FOXO3a via the STRING database. The mRNA and protein expression of FOXO3a and catalase were detected by qRT-PCR or western blotting in LNCaP and 22RV1 cells treated with DHT, R1881, or Enzalutamide. The effects of FOXO3a on catalase expression were tested by over-expressing or knocking down FOXO3a in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, the catalase activity and ROS level were detected in LNCaP cells treated with DHT. Cell proliferation and ROS were also analyzed in LNCaP which was treated with antioxidant.  Results:   Results showed that the catalase expression was down-regulated in prostate cancer. A positive correlation between FOXO3a and catalase existed. DHT treatment could significantly reduce FOXO3a and catalase expression at mRNA and protein level in LNCaP cells. Catalase expression partly depended on FOXO3a as over-expression and knockdown of FOXO3a could result in the expresssion change of catalase. DHT treatment was found to inhibit catalase activity and increase ROS level in prostate cancer cell. Our study also demonstrated that antioxidant treatment reduced DHT-induced proliferation and ROS production in prostate cancer cell.

In this study, we compared the cancer detection and complication rates of transperineal magnetic resonance/ultrasound (MR/US) fusion biopsy and transrectal cognitive fusion biopsy of the prostate.  Methods:   This was a comparative study of two prospectively collected cohorts. Men with clinically suspected prostate cancer and prostate imaging reporting and data system (PI-RADS) score ≥ 3 lesions on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) were enrolled. They underwent either transperineal software fusion biopsy or transrectal cognitive fusion biopsy and systematic biopsy. The detection rates of any prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC, defined as Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) and the complication rates between both groups were analysed.  Results:   Ninety-two and 85 patients underwent transperineal software fusion and transrectal cognitive fusion biopsies, respectively. The detection rate for any prostate cancer was similar between both groups (60.8% vs. 56.4%, p = 0.659). In terms of csPC detection, transperineal fusion biopsy outperformed transrectal fusion biopsy (52.2% vs. 36.5%, p = 0.036). In multivariate regression analysis, age, PI-RADS score > 3, and transperineal route were significant predictors of csPC. Meanwhile, transperineal biopsy resulted in a higher rate of urinary retention than transrectal biopsy (18.5% vs. 4.7%, p = 0.009).

Patients and methods:   A retrospective analysis of a study that incorporated PSMA-PET for men with BCR after radical prostatectomy (RP) was undertaken. EAU risk groups were considered relative to clinical variables, PSMA-PET findings, and deployment of salvage radiotherapy (SRT). The primary oncological outcome was event-free survival (EFS) and this was analysed relative to clinical and imaging variables. An 'event' occurred if prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level rose >0.2 ng/mL above nadir or additional therapies were introduced.  Results:   A total of 137 patients were included, most of whom had EAU high-risk disease (76%) and/or low PSA levels (80% <0.5 ng/mL) at the time of PSMA-PET. EAU risk group was not associated with regional nodal/distant metastasis on PSMA-PET. Regional nodal/distant metastasis on PSMA PET (compared to negative/local recurrence: hazard ratio [HR] 2.2; P = 0.002) and SRT use (vs no SRT: HR 0.44; P = 0.004) were associated with EFS. EAU high-risk status was not significantly associated with worse EFS (HR 1.7, P = 0.12) compared to EAU low-risk status. Among patients who received SRT, both regional/distant metastasis on PSMA-PET (HR 3.1; P < 0.001) and EAU high-risk status (HR 2.9; P = 0.04) were independently associated with worse EFS, which was driven by patients in the EAU high-risk group with regional/distant metastases (38%; HR 3.1, P = 0.001).  Conclusions:   In patients with post-RP BCR, PSMA-PET findings and receipt of SRT predicted EFS. In patients receiving SRT, PSMA status combined with EAU risk grouping was most predictive of EFS.

A uropathologist-level artificial intelligence (AI) system could help make unbiased decisions and improve pathologists' efficiency. We previously reported an artificial neural network-based, automated, diagnostic software for prostate biopsy, DeepDx® Prostate (DeepDx). Using an independent external dataset, we aimed to validate the performance of DeepDx at the levels of prostate cancer diagnosis and grading and evaluate its potential value to the general pathologist. A dataset composed of 593 whole-slide images of prostate biopsies (130 normal and 463 adenocarcinomas) was assembled, including their original pathology reports. The Gleason scores (GSs) and grade groups (GGs) determined by three uropathology experts were considered as the reference standard. A general pathologist conducted user validation by scoring the dataset with and without AI assistance. DeepDx was accurate for prostate cancer detection at a similar level to the original pathology report, whereas it was more concordant than the latter with the reference GGs and GSs (kappa/quadratic-weighted kappa = 0.713/0.922 vs. 0.619/0.873 for GGs and 0.654/0.904 vs. 0.576/0.858 for GSs). Notably, it outperformed the original report, especially in the detection of Gleason patterns 4/5, and achieved excellent agreement in quantifying the Gleason pattern 4. When the general pathologist used AI assistance, the concordance of GG between the user and the reference standard increased (kappa/quadratic-weighted kappa, 0.621/0.876 to 0.741/0.925), while the average slide examination time was substantially decreased (55.7 to 36.8 s/case). Overall, DeepDx was capable of making expert-level diagnosis in prostate core biopsies. In addition, its remarkable performance in detecting high-grade Gleason patterns and enhancing the general pathologist's diagnostic performance supports its potential value in routine practice.""","""['Minsun Jung#', 'Min-Sun Jin#', 'Chungyeul Kim', 'Cheol Lee', 'Ilias P Nikas', 'Jeong Hwan Park', 'Han Suk Ryu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Artificial intelligence for diagnosis and grading of prostate cancer in biopsies: a population-based, diagnostic study.', 'An artificial intelligence algorithm for prostate cancer diagnosis in whole slide images of core needle biopsies: a blinded clinical validation and deployment study.', 'Evaluation of the Use of Combined Artificial Intelligence and Pathologist Assessment to Review and Grade Prostate Biopsies.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Diagnosis and Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer in Biopsies-Current Status and Next Steps.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Gene signature of m6A RNA regulators in diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, and immune microenvironment for cervical cancer.']"""

Furthermore, use of statins has been associated with prolonged time before development of castration resistance (CR) during androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer. However, the efficacy of statins on delaying castration-resistance has not been tested in a randomised placebo-controlled setting.This study aims to test statins' efficacy compared to placebo in delaying development of CR during ADT treatment for primary metastatic or recurrent prostate cancer. Secondary aim is to explore effect of statin intervention on prostate cancer mortality and lipid metabolism during ADT.  Methods and analysis:   In this randomised placebo-controlled trial, a total of 400 men with de novo metastatic prostate cancer or recurrent disease after primary treatment and starting ADT will be recruited and randomised 1:1 to use daily 80 mg of atorvastatin or placebo. All researchers, study nurses and patients will be blinded throughout the trial. Patients are followed until disease recurrence or death. Primary outcome is time to formation of CR after initiation of ADT. Serum lipid levels (total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and trigyserides) are analysed to test whether changes in serum cholesterol parameters during ADT predict length of treatment response. Furthermore, the trial will compare quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity, changes in blood glucose and circulating cell-free DNA, and urine lipidome during trial.

Methods:   Two hundred and eighty-six participants were randomly recruited, 231 patients with PCa and 55 healthy controls. According to their Gleason scores (GSs), the patients with PCa were divided into two groups, mild PCa (GS6) (n = 116) and severe (≥GS7) group (n = 115). The concentrations of 8 sex steroid hormones in urinary exosomes were quantitated using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LC-APCI-MS/MS).  Results:   The results showed that the levels of 7 out of 8 sex steroids including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosteronesulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione (A4), testosterone (T), progesterone (P), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and estrone (E1), but not estradiol (E2) in urinary exosomes, were not only distinguished the PCa patients from healthy controls, can also differentiate between patients with mild and severe PCa.

Percentages of apoptotic cells were evaluated by Annexin/P.I. staining, the proliferative inhibitory effect was assessed by Micro Culture Tetrazolium Test (MTT), and mRNA levels of KLK2, E-cadherin, SNAIL, angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), and apoptosis genes (BAX, Bcl2, and P53) expression were investigated by the real-time PCR method. ANOVA and t-test were used to appraise the results.  Results:   For the first time, we presented that the combination therapy of Curcumin and As2O3 increases prostate cancer cell apoptosis and inhibits proliferation; Our data displayed that Curcumin (15 μM and 10 μM in PC3 and LNCap), As2O3 (8 μM and 5 μM in PC3 and LNCap), and also their combination (15 μM Curcumin and 8 μM As2O3 in PC3, 10 μM Curcumin and 5 μM As2O3 in LNCap cell lines) significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells and inhibited cell growth (P < 0.05) compared with each drug alone. Generally, both cell lines treated with the combination of Curcumin and As2O3 displayed decreased angiogenesis genes (VEGFA and VEGFC), apoptosis genes (BAX and Bcl2), and prostate cancer marker (KLK2), the zinc-finger protein (SNAIL); and an increase in expression (P < 0.05) of cell-cell adhesion molecule (E-cadherin) and tumor suppressor gene (P53) genes.  Conclusions:   The antitumor effects of combination therapy with As2O3 and Curcumin have been displayed on prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP and PC3), which probably originates from their potential to induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells simultaneously.""","""['Akram Mirzaei', 'Fatemeh Jahanshahi', 'Fatemeh Khatami', 'Leonardo Oliveira Reis', 'Seyed Mohammad Kazem Aghamir']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Tissue Cell""","""['The effect of mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes on the prostate, bladder, and renal cancer cell lines.', 'Novel combination therapy of prostate cancer cells with arsenic trioxide and flutamide: An in-vitro study.', 'Combined anticancer effects of simvastatin and arsenic trioxide on prostate cancer cell lines via downregulation of the VEGF and OPN isoforms genes.', 'The effects of arsenic trioxide (As2O3) on human megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines.

Studies have indicated that disrupted IP may be improved by healthy diets and weight loss. In the Carbohydrate and Prostate Study 2 (CAPS2) clinical trial, which showed that a low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) reduced weight significantly in men with PC and suggestively slowed PC disease progression, we explored the impact of LCD on an IP marker, zonulin and an inflammation marker, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).  Methods:   CAPS2 was a 6-month randomized controlled trial testing a LCD intervention vs. control on PC progression using prostate-specific antigen doubling time (PSADT) as the marker. All 45 participants had prior primary PC treatment, PSADT >3 and <36 months, and body mass index (BMI) ≥24 kg/m2.  Results:   At 6-month, zonulin decreased in the LCD arm (median -8.3%, IQR -16.6, 0.3%) while the control increased slightly (median 1.4%, IQR -3.0, 13.3%; p = .014). No changes were observed in hsCRP. Linear regression models showed that weight change was significantly associated with log(PSADT) such that the greater the weight loss, the longer the PSADT(p = .003). There was a similar inverse trend between change in zonulin and log(PSADT) (p = .050). Nevertheless, the mediation analysis showed that zonulin was not a significant intermediary mechanism of the effect of weight change on PSADT (p = .3).  Conclusion:   Future studies are merited to examine further the potential association of IP with inflammation and to clarify if improvement in IP is associated with decreased PC progression.

Its genotoxicity, anti-genotoxicity and histopathological activities against the chemotherapeutic drug cyclophosphamide (CP) was investigated. The study also evaluated its anticancer activities against six human cancer cell lines: hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2), Prostate (PC3), Lung carcinoma (A549), Skin cancer (A431), Colon cancer (HCT116) and Breast cancer (MCF7).  Methods:   The genotoxicity was determined using: micronucleus, chromosomal aberration, and comet assays. The histopathological study included liver. The examined groups were control negative, control plant, control positive (CP), and 3 combined groups received LAEO at different concentrations plus CP.  Results:   GC/MS analysis recorded 16 components. The principals were: linalool and linalyl acetate. The results indicated the safety of LAEO. It also attenuates genotoxicity and deleterious histopathological effects of CP in a dose-dependent manner.

Metastasis-free survival (MFS) was the primary outcome. Patients were stratified by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence after RP. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationships between clinicopathological characteristics and survival. Survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test with or without propensity score matching. Prognoses, including MFS and overall survival, were prominently inferior among patients with persistent PSA compared with those without persistent PSA. In multivariate analysis, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) plus radiotherapy (RT) was associated with better MFS than ADT alone among patients with persistent PSA (hazard ratio = 0.37; 95% confidence interval = 0.15-0.93; p = 0.034).

Two important genes namely hepsin (HPN) and inosine 5-monophosphate dehydrogenase type 2 (IMPDH2) were studied to understand the pathogenesis of this disease. This study aimed to determine the transcript level of PCa-related genes, HPN and IMPDH2, in archived tissues. Their functional roles were further determined using an in vitro model of PCa. Total RNA extraction was done from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PCa tissues, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues acted as the control. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to measure HPN and IMPDH2 expression. The functional assay was performed in a prostate cancer cell line (DU145) on these two genes by silencing their RNA. We discovered a significantly higher expression of IMPDH2 in PCa samples compared to non-cancerous tissues (P < 0.001). While HPN expression level showed a downward trend in PCa but the result was not statistically significant compared to the control. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of IMPDH2 expression in the cell line significantly decreased cell proliferation. The silencing of IMPDH2, however, did not affect cell migration, invasion, and apoptosis of the DU145 cell line. Our study demonstrated that IMPDH2 plays an essential role in clinical samples as well as in vitro models of this cancer.

Quality and engaging supportive care programs are needed to reduce these chronic and debilitating effects. Independent of physical activity (PA), high volumes of sedentary behavior (SB) are associated with chronic disease-related risk factors and poorer cancer-specific quality of life (QoL). Simultaneously increasing PA and decreasing SB may be an effective health promotion strategy. Given that PCS may face several barriers to engaging in supervised programs, there is a need to develop and assess the efficacy of interventions that employ distance-based approaches for behavior change. The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of a 12-week intervention (Fitbit + behavioral counselling) vs. Fitbit-only control group in reducing SB among PCS. Secondary outcomes include light-intensity PA, QoL, motivational outcomes, and patient satisfaction.  Methods:   This two-armed, randomized controlled trial will recruit inactive PCS (stage I-IV) across Canada who self-report engaging in >8 hours/day of SB. Participants will be randomized to the intervention (n=60; Fitbit and behavioral support) or active control group (n=60; Fitbit-only). The intervention consists of the use of a Fitbit and a series of six behavioral support sessions (two group, four individual) to aid PCS in gradually replacing SB with light-intensity PA by increasing their daily step counts to 3,000 steps above their baseline values. The Fitbit-only control condition will receive a Fitbit and public health PA resources. The primary outcome is change in SB measured objectively using activPAL inclinometers. All secondary outcomes will be measured via self-report, except for PA which will be measuring using Fitbits. Data will be collected at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6-month post-intervention.  Discussion:   Reducing SB and increasing light-intensity PA plays an important, yet often undervalued role in the health and well-being of PCS. This study will create a unique distance-based platform that can be used by clinical and community-based organizations as a low-cost, supportive care tool to improve health outcomes for PCS.

Methods:   The PMS was a prospective, multicenter, observational study of patients with metastatic, docetaxel-refractory CRPC treated with cabazitaxel in Japan after its launch in 2014. Graphical Markov (GM) model-based simulations and network clustering in 'R' package were conducted to identify correlations between clinical factors and outcomes. Factors shown to be associated with overall survival (OS) in the machine learning analysis were confirmed according to the clinical outcomes observed in the PMS.  Results:   Among the 660 patients analyzed, median patient age was 70.0 years, and median OS and time-to-treatment failure (TTF) were 319 and 116 days, respectively. In GM-based simulations, factors associated with OS were liver metastases, performance status (PS), TTF, and neutropenia (threshold 0.05), and liver metastases, PS, and TTF (threshold 0.01). Factors associated with TTF were OS and relative dose intensity (threshold 0.05), and OS (threshold 0.01). In network clustering in 'R' package, factors associated with OS were number of treatment cycles, discontinuation due to disease progression, and TTF (threshold 0.05), and liver and lung metastases, PS, discontinuation due to adverse events, and febrile neutropenia (threshold 0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis of patient subgroups demonstrated that visceral metastases and poor PS at baseline were associated with worse OS, while neutropenia or febrile neutropenia and higher number of cabazitaxel cycles were associated with better OS.  Conclusions:   Neutropenia may be a predictive factor for treatment efficacy in terms of survival. Poor PS and distant metastases to the liver and lungs were shown to be associated with worse outcomes, while factors related to treatment duration were shown to positively correlate with better OS.""","""['Hirotaka Kazama', 'Osamu Kawaguchi', 'Takeshi Seto', 'Kazuhiro Suzuki', 'Hideyasu Matsuyama', 'Nobuaki Matsubara', 'Yuki Tajima', 'Taro Fukao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Safety and efficacy of cabazitaxel in 660 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in real-world settings: results of a Japanese post-marketing surveillance study.', 'Real-world efficacy and safety of two doses of cabazitaxel (20 or 25\u2009mg/m2) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer: results of a Japanese post-marketing surveillance study.', 'Cabazitaxel in patients aged ≥80\u202fyears with castration-resistant prostate cancer: Results of a post-marketing surveillance study in Japan.', 'Cabazitaxel: a novel second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Oncologic Response and Hospitalization Rate of Patients Receiving Cabazitaxel in the Fourth-Line and Beyond in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Analysis of a Retrospective Cohort and a Structured Literature Review.']"""

CM-272 is a dual inhibitor of both methyltransferases' activity. Herein, we assessed the response of different PCa cell lines to CM-272, in both 2D and 3D models, and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying CM-272 inhibitory effects. CRPC tissues displayed significantly higher DNMT1, G9a and H3K9me2 expression than localized PCa. In vitro, CM-272 caused a significant decrease in PCa cell viability and proliferation alongside with increased apoptotic levels. We disclose that, under the evaluated dose, CM-272 led to G9a activity inhibition, while not significantly affecting DNMT1 activity. Upon G9a knockdown, DU145 and PC3 showed decreased cell viability. Remarkably, DU145 cells treated with CM-272 or with G9a knockdown displayed no differences in viability, suggesting a SET-dependent mechanism. Contrarily, PC3 cell viability impact was higher in G9a knockdown, compared with CM-272 treatment, suggesting an additional G9a function. Moreover, DU145 cells overexpressing catalytically functional G9a disclosed higher resistance to CM-272 treatment, reinforcing that the drug mechanism of action is dependent on G9a catalytic function. Importantly, we successfully assembled spheroids from several prostate cell lines. Our results showed that CM-272 retained its anti-tumoral effects in 3D PCa models, leading to a clear reduction in cancer cell survival.

Transplant candidates with a history of pre-transplant malignancy must meet remission criteria before listing to minimize the risk of recurrence, however these patients may have an intrinsic predisposition to developing subsequent cancers which can be amplified by immunosuppression. We assessed whether pre-transplant malignancy was associated with an increased risk of developing malignancy of any type after lung transplant.  Methods:   We conducted a single centre retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing lung transplant between January 2006 and December 2017. We used a proportional hazards regression model to test whether preTM was associated with the risk of developing one or more postTM after lung transplant, adjusted for known cancer risk factors.  Results:   497 adult patients underwent lung transplantation during the study period and 26 (5.2%) had pre-transplant malignancies. Out of 29 pre-transplant cancer diagnoses, prostate cancer was the most common (17.2%), followed by breast cancer and basal cell carcinoma (13.8% each). 108 (22%) patients developed post-transplant malignancy with a total of 328 cancer diagnoses. The most common post-transplant malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (86.3%), followed by solid organ cancers (7.6%). Pre-transplant malignancy was associated with an adjusted HR of 3.24 (95% CI 1.71 to 6.14, p < 0.001) for the development of post-transplant malignancy. Recurrence of the pre-transplant malignancy only occurred in 3 patients post-transplant.  Conclusions:   History of pre-transplant malignancy was associated with a more than three times likelihood of development of a post-transplant malignancy compared to recipients without a previous history of cancer, the majority being unrelated to the initial malignancy. These findings highlight the importance of frequent cancer surveillance in lung transplant recipients, especially in those with a history of pre-transplant malignancy.""","""['Viktor Sekowski', 'Kathy Jackson', 'Kieran Halloran', 'Rhea Varughese', 'Jayan Nagendran', 'Justin Weinkauf', 'Dale Lien', 'Alim Hirji']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Respir Med""","""['Corrigendum to ""Pre-transplant malignancy is associated with increased risk of de novo malignancy post-lung transplantation"" Respir.

Objective:   To characterize the clinical evaluation of hematospermia and its association with the diagnosis of urologic malignancy.  Materials and methods:   Using MarketScan insurance claims database, we identified adult males 18-64 years old diagnosed with hematospermia from 2010 to 2018. Benign hematospermia was defined as the absence of hematuria and elevated prostate-specific antigen. Patients with urologic cancer prior to diagnosis of hematospermia were excluded. We identified those who were diagnosed with a urologic malignancy.  Results:   The annual average incidence rate of hematospermia was 56.6 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 55.4-57.8 per 100,000) in 2010 and increased to 73.6 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval 71.7-75.4 per 100,000) in 2018. A total of 56,157 patients presented with benign hematospermia. Most (57.5%) underwent at least one test, with the most common being urinalysis (51.7%), followed by prostate-specific antigen testing (11.9%).

Such foci can pose diagnostic conundrums and risk incorrect staging. The aim of this short communication is to share the results of PET-guided biopsies of such foci.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis revealed 10 patients who were referred to our department for PET-guided biopsy of UBU visible in a previous [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT. [18F]-PSMA-1007 PET-guided biopsy was conducted for 11 PSMA-avid bone foci in these 10 patients. The biopsy materials were analysed for tissue typing, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for prostate-specific-membrane-antigen (PSMA) expression. The scans were analysed by two experienced physicians in a consensus read for clinical characteristics and radiopharmaceutical uptake of foci.  Results:   One out of 11 (9.1%) of the foci biopsied was confirmed as bone metastasis of PC with intense PSMA-expression, while 10/11 (90.9%) foci were revealed to be unremarkable bone tissue without evidence of PSMA expression at IHC. Amongst all bone foci assessed by biopsy, eight were visually classified as being at high risk of malignancy in the PET/CT (SUVmean 12.0 ± 8.1; SUVmax 18.8 ± 13.1), three as equivocal (SUVmean 4.6 ± 2.1; SUVmax 7.2 ± 3.0) and zero as low risk. No UBU had any CT correlate.  Conclusions:   This cohort biopsy revealed that a small but relevant number of UBU are true metastases. For those confirmed as benign, no PSMA expression at IHC was observed, suggesting a non-PSMA mediated cause for intensive [18F]PSMA-1007 uptake of which the reason remains unclear.

Results:   A total of 2942 men underwent prostate MRI and a prostate biopsy: 2322 underwent MRI-TB and 620 had SB only. The detection rate of csPCa increased 2.5-fold from 23 to 58%. The detection rate of PCa and csPCa was significantly higher in patients who underwent MRI-TB compared to those who underwent SB only (67% vs. 52% and 40% vs. 32%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both comparisons)). The number of csPCa diagnosed by MRI-TB increased linearly over the study period and represented the majority of PCa diagnoses after 2016.  Conclusion:   Implementation of MRI-TB in patients with positive MRI led to improved detection of csPCa.""","""['Louis Lenfant', 'Raphaele Renard-Penna', 'Yann de Rycke', 'Morgan Rouprêt', 'Aurelien Beaugerie', 'Eva Comperat', 'Emmanuel Chartier-Kastler', 'Pierre C Mozer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['The FUTURE Trial: A Multicenter Randomised Controlled Trial on Target Biopsy Techniques Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prior Negative Biopsies.', 'Diagnostic performance of MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsies vs. systematic prostate biopsies in biopsy-naïve, previous negative biopsy patients and men undergoing active surveillance.', 'Is There Still a Need for Repeated Systematic Biopsies in Patients with Previous Negative Biopsies in the Era of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsies of the Prostate?', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

They consist of a protein toxin conjugated to a targeting moiety, which recognizes a specific antigen on surface of cancer cells and accordingly induces cell death by toxin segment. The targeting part could be a nanobody, which is a group of antibodies composed of an only functional single variable heavy chain (VHH).Therefore, this study was done to produce an immunotoxin (VGRNb-DT) by chemical conjugation of a truncated diphtheria toxin moiety to an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2(VEGFR-2) nanobody, and to identify effectiveness of immunotoxin in recognizing the VEGFR-2- positive cancer cells and inhibiting cell growth and survival. Diphtheria toxin was expressed and purified by nickel affinity chromatography, and accordingly, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis confirmed its expression. Function of heterobifunctional crosslinkers, Sulfo-SMCC (sulfosuccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane-1-carboxylate), and SATP (N-succinimidyl-S- acetylthiopropionate) for bioconjugation purposes was acknowledged by cation exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Cytotoxicity of immunotoxin was evaluated on the VEGFR-2 positive PC-3 cell line by MTT assay. Overexpression of VEGFR-2 in the PC-3 cell line allowed immunotoxin to recognize them by anti-VEGFR-2 nanobodies. The concentrations above 5 μg/ml represented a significant decrease in cell survival rate in PC-3 cells compared to HEK293 cells (VEGFR-2 negative cells) as controls.VGRNb-DT demonstrated a successful bioconjugation; furthermore, variable concentrations were correlated with cell death in prostate cancer PC-3 cells.""","""['Samira Shajari', 'Mohammad Morad Farajollahi', 'Mahdi Behdani', 'Parastoo Tarighi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Biotechnol""","""['A Novel Immunotoxin Targeting Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule Using Single Domain Antibody Fused to Diphtheria Toxin.', 'Preparation and antitumor effect of a toxin-linked conjugate targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and urokinase plasminogen activator.', 'Inhibition of neovascularisation in human endothelial cells using anti NRP-1 nanobody fused to truncated form of diphtheria toxin as a novel immunotoxin.', 'Immunotoxins and nanobody-based immunotoxins: review and update.', 'Recombinant immunotoxins containing truncated bacterial toxins for the treatment of hematologic malignancies.', 'Nanobodies: a new potential for prostate cancer treatment.']"""

The investigation included companion, phase II studies: total eradication therapy-1 (TET-1) for those treatment-naïve and total eradication therapy-2 (TET-2) for those post-prostatectomy. The treatment-naive protocol included androgen deprivation and docetaxel (with concurrent abiraterone added in a protocol amendment), followed by a prostatectomy, adjuvant radiation (if positive margins, T3/4, or detectable PSA), and metastasis-directed therapy. The post-prostatectomy protocol assigned the same therapies (omitting the prostatectomy). The primary endpoint was an undetectable PSA with recovered testosterone.

The aims of this study were to investigate the status of psychosocial adaptation (PSA), medication adherence and quality of life (QOL) in breast cancer women with adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET), and to analyze the influencing factors of QOL and explore the relationship among them.  Methods:   346 breast cancer women were selected who underwent endocrine therapy after surgery, and data collected by the general information questionnaire, the PSA questionnaire among breast cancer women with AET, Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B). The relationship among the variables was investigated by univariate analysis, multiple stepwise regression analysis and mediating effect analysis.  Results:   The scores of PSA, medication adherence and QOL were slightly above the medium level.
