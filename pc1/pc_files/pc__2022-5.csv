We investigated clinical and pathological covariates to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RARP.  Methods:   A retrospective multicenter cohort study was conducted in RARP patients with PCa at 10 institutions in Japan. Pre- and postoperative covariates were collected from enrolled patients. The primary endpoint was defined as biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). Additionally, the association between BCR and clinicopathological covariates was determined.  Results:   We enrolled 2670 patients in this study. The median follow-up period was 26.0 months. RARP-related perioperative complications were identified in 198 patients (7.4%), including 69 patients (2.6%) with grade 3/4 complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. The 2-year BRFS was 88.0%. Using the Kaplan-Meier method, initial prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of ≤7.6 ng/mL, biopsy and pathological Gleason score (GS) of ≤7, clinical and pathological T1/2, and low/intermediate risks according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk classification, and negative surgical margin status had significant BRFS than their counterparts. In multivariate analysis, initial PSA, biopsy and pathological GS, clinical and pathological T stage, and surgical margin status significantly correlated with BCR after RARP.  Conclusion:   In this study, RARP achieved a lower incidence of perioperative complications than other studies.""","""['Daiki Kato', 'Shin Ebara', 'Tomoyuki Tatenuma', 'Takeshi Sasaki', 'Yoshinori Ikehata', 'Akinori Nakayama', 'Masahiro Toide', 'Tatsuaki Yoneda', 'Kazushige Sakaguchi', 'Jun Teishima', 'Kazuhide Makiyama', 'Takahiro Inoue', 'Hiroshi Kitamura', 'Kazutaka Saito', 'Fumitaka Koga', 'Shinji Urakami', 'Takuya Koie']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Asian J Endosc Surg""","""['The Impact of Gleason Grade 3 as a Predictive Factor for Biochemical Recurrence after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study in Japan (The MSUG94 Group).', 'Predictive factors and oncological outcomes of persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen in patients following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes in patients with clinically high-risk prostate cancer treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: results from a multi-institutional study of 1100 patients.', 'Long-term cancer control outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Nomogram Predicting Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer in Patients with Clinically Organ-Confined Disease Who Underwent Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Retrospective Multicenter Cohort Study in Japan (The MSUG94 Group).']"""

Methods:   We identified Caucasian, African American, Hispanic/Latino and Asian metastatic urothelial bladder cancer patients from 2004 to 2011 within the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Social Security Administration tables were used to compute 5 year LE. LT-derived LE was compared to observed overall survival OS. Additionally, we relied on Poisson regression plots to display cancer-specific mortality (CSM) relative to other-cause mortality (OCM) for each race/ethnicity.  Results:   Overall, 2286 MBCa patients were identified. Of those, 1800 (79%) were Caucasian vs 212 (9.3%) African American vs 189 (8.3%) Hispanic/Latino vs 85 (3.7%) Asians. The median age at diagnosis was 71 years for Asians vs 70 for Caucasians vs 67 for Hispanic/Latinos vs 67 for African Americans. African Americans showed the biggest difference between observed OS and LT-predicted LE at five years (- 83.8%), followed by Hispanic/Latinos (- 81%), Caucasians (- 77%) and Asian patients (- 69%). In Poisson regression plots, Hispanic/Latinos displayed the highest cancer-specific mortality rate (88%), while African/Americans showed the highest other cause mortality rate (12%). Conversely, Asian patients displayed the lowest CSM rate (83%) and second lowest OCM rate (7%).

However, insights on the androgen independent regulation and function of ERG during stress are limited. Here, we identify PGC1α as a coactivator of ERG fusion under various metabolic stress. Deacetylase SIRT1 is necessary for PGC1α-ERG interaction and function. We reveal that ERG drives the expression of antioxidant genes; SOD1 and TXN, benefitting PCa growth. We observe increased expression of these antioxidant genes in patients with high ERG expression correlates with poor survival.

Emerging evidence support that alternative oncogenic pathways may bypass the androgen receptor (AR) signaling to promote ENZR progression, however, the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly defined. Here, we report that the expression of RuvB like AAA ATPase 1 (RUVBL1) is upregulated in ENZR cells and xenograft models and prostate tumors in patients. Enzalutamide increases RUVBL1 accumulation in the cytoplasm, which in turn enhances the recruitment of CRAF proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase protein to plexin A1 (PLXNA1) and the subsequent activation of the downstream MAPK pathway. Co-overexpression of RUVBL1 and PLXNA1 defines a subgroup of prostate cancer (PCa) patients with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of RUVBL1 by CB-6644 suppresses ENZR cell proliferation and xenograft growth and allows re-sensitization of ENZR cells and xenografts to enzalutamide, indicating that RUVBL1 may act to substitute the AR signaling to promote cancer cell survival and ENZR development.

Materials and methods:   In men scheduled for prostate biopsy for standard clinical indications, rectal and perineal skin swabs, and 2 extra biopsy cores, were obtained. Specimens underwent DNA extraction followed by next-generation sequencing and standard laboratory culture. Microbial quantity and composition were determined and compared between prostate core biopsy tissue from individuals who underwent TP vs TR biopsy.  Results:   Twenty-three men were accrued to the study. Biopsy core tissue from the TP group had less microbial diversity (15.0 vs 25.8 phylogenetic clades/sample, P = .0004) and had a lower quantity of known pathogens (36.3 vs 104.2 normalized counts of pathogens/sample, P = .018) relative to the TR group. TP group tissue core flora was more attributable to the perineal than rectal source (P = .047). Viable Escherichia coli was isolated from 45% of the TR group cores, but none in the TP group (P = .014).  Conclusion:   Biopsy tissue from individuals who undergo TP biopsy harbors a lower human pathogenic bacterial load than those who undergo TR biopsy, with a minimal risk of viable E. coli. Our results elucidate a possible mechanism for reduced infectious risk associated with TP biopsy relative to TR biopsy and a rational basis for widespread implementation of TP biopsy.""","""['Glenn T Werneburg', 'Ava Adler', 'Ao Zhang', 'Sromona D Mukherjee', 'Samuel Haywood', 'Aaron W Miller', 'Eric A Klein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urology""","""['RE: ""Transperineal Prostate Biopsy is Associated With Lower Tissue Core Pathogen Burden Relative to Transrectal Biopsy: Mechanistic Underpinnings for Lower Infection Risk in the Transperineal Approach"".', 'The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'Comparisons of cancer detection rate and complications between transrectal and transperineal prostate biopsy approaches - a single center preliminary study.', 'Assessment of complications after transperineal and transrectal prostate biopsy using a risk-stratified pathway identifying patients at risk for post-biopsy infections.', 'The results of transperineal versus transrectal prostate biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Should Transperineal Prostate Biopsy Be the Standard of Care?', 'Biofilms on Indwelling Artificial Urinary Sphincter Devices Harbor Complex Microbe-Metabolite Interaction Networks and Reconstitute Differentially In Vitro by Material Type.']"""

Thus, the new therapeutic strategies targeting ARs may also be important for treatment of prostate cancer (PC) and its biology. The studies have shown that miRNAs to be dysregulated in PC progression. Therefore, in the present study, differentially expressed miRNAs that predictively target the ARs were identified and investigated by in silico analysis.  Main methods:   Cellular proliferation, qPCR, western blot and apoptosis assays were performed to investigate the molecular mechanism of the selected miRNAs in the PC cells.  Key findings:   In our miRNA qPCR study, several miRNAs were found to be differentially regulated in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells (LNCaP-Abl and LNCaP-104R2) compared with androgen dependent (AD) cells (LNCaP). The expression levels of miR-625-5p and miR-874-3p were significantly increased in LNCaP-Abl (2.62-fold, p = 0.0002; 4.00-fold, p = 0.00002, respectively) and LNCaP-104R2 (2.44-fold, p = 0.0455; 3.77-fold, p = 0.0383, respectively) compared with AD cells. The expression levels of AR and prostate specific antigen were increased in PC cells compared with AD cells. Furthermore, transfection of PC cells with anti-miRs suppressed their proliferation and AR protein levels (p < 0.05).  Significance:   Several differentially regulated miRNAs were identified in CRPC cells, including miR-625-5p and miR-874-3p that are potentially involved in PC progression. These results may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism underlying CRPC cells and miRNA applications may constitute a new and alternative method to prevent development of CRPC cells in the future.""","""['Çağdaş Aktan', 'Çağ Çal', 'Burçin Kaymaz', 'Nur Selvi Günel', 'Sezgi Kıpçak', 'Buket Özel', 'Cumhur Gündüz', 'Ali Şahin Küçükaslan', 'Duygu Aygüneş Jafari', 'Buket Kosova']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Identification of miR-30b-3p and miR-30d-5p as direct regulators of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer by complementary functional microRNA library screening.', 'Upregulation of miR-3195, miR-3687 and miR-4417 is associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen-regulated miR-32 targets BTG2 and is overexpressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'MicroRNA Regulation of Androgen Receptor in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Premises, Promises, and Potentials.', 'LINC00958 Inhibits Autophagy of Bladder Cancer Cells via Sponge Adsorption of miR-625-5p to Promote Tumor Angiogenesis and Oxidative Stress.']"""

Methods:   Retrospective study on 745 patients who underwent combined MRI-TBx plus SBx. Primary outcome was the upgrade to clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa; grade group ≥ 2) on SBx versus MRI-TBx. Variables (age, previous biopsy status, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score, index lesion size/location, number of lesions, PSA, PSA density, prostate volume) associated with the primary outcome were identified by logistic regression and used for biopsy strategies. Clinical utility was assessed by decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   SBx detected 47 (6%) additional men with csPCa. The risk of detecting csPCa uniquely on SBx was significantly lower in men with PI-RADS 5 (versus PI-RADS 3: OR 0.30, p = 0.03; versus PI-RADS 4: OR 0.33, p = 0.01), and previous negative biopsy (versus previous positive biopsy: OR 0.40, p = 0.007), and increased with age (per 10 years: OR 1.64, p = 0.016). No significant association was observed for other variables. DCA identified the following strategies as most useful: (a) avoid SBx in men with PI-RADS 5 and (b) additionally in those with previous negative biopsy, resulting in avoiding SBx in 201 (27%) and 429 (58%), while missing csPCa in 5 (1%) and 15 (2%) patients, respectively.  Conclusion:   Not all men benefit equally from the combination of SBx and MRI-TBx. SBx avoidance in men with PI-RADS 5 and/or previous negative biopsy may reduce the risk of excess biopsies with a low risk of missing csPCa.  Key points:   • In men undergoing MRI-targeted biopsy, the risk of detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) only on additional systematic biopsy (SBx) decreased in men with PI-RADS 5, previous negative biopsy, and younger age. • Using these variables may help select men who could avoid the risk of excess SBx. • If missing csPCa in 5% was acceptable, forgoing SBx in men with PI-RADS 5 and/or previous negative biopsy enabled the highest net reduction in SBx.""","""['Dominik Deniffel', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Stephanie Girgis', 'Gerard M Healy', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Robert Hamilton', 'Girish Kulkarni', 'Ants Toi', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Alexandre Zlotta', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Masoom A Haider']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Towards a judicious use of perilesional biopsy in the era of MRI-targeting, parting of the ways from systematic prostate biopsy.', 'Should we combine systematic with MRI-targeted biopsy?

Past research has mostly been conducted in North American cohorts of White men.  Methods:   In the multiethnic cohort (MEC), we investigated the association of prediagnostic statin use with the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer across five racial/ethnic groups (White, African American, Japanese American, Latino, and Native Hawaiian).  Results:   Among 31,062 male participants who completed a detailed medication questionnaire, 31.4% reported use of statins, 2,748 developed prostate cancer, and 261 died from the disease. After adjusting for potential confounders, prediagnostic statin use was associated with a 32% lower risk of fatal prostate cancer [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.91], with the inverse association suggested consistently across the five racial/ethnic groups. Moreover, an 11% lower risk of aggressive prostate cancer (95% CI = 0.76-1.03) was observed in statin users than in nonusers. We found no statistically significant association between prediagnostic statin use and total prostate cancer or nonaggressive disease. Prediagnostic statin use was suggestively associated with a 19% reduction in prostate cancer-specific mortality (95% CI = 0.59-1.10) and an 8% reduction in all-cause mortality (95% CI = 0.79-1.07).

Methods:   Neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) and four neighborhood obesogenic environment factors (urbanicity, mixed-land development, unhealthy food environment, and parks) were assessed for associations with prostate cancer risk among 41,563 African American, Japanese American, Latino, and White males in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study, California site. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for nonaggressive and aggressive prostate cancer, adjusting for individual-level sociodemographic, behavioral, and prostate cancer risk factors. Analyses were stratified by race, ethnicity, and, among Latino males, nativity.  Results:   Males residing in low-SES, compared with high-SES, neighborhoods had lower risk of nonaggressive prostate cancer [lowest vs. highest quintile HR = 0.81; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.68-0.95, Ptrend 0.024], driven by a similar trend among foreign-born Latino males. Foreign-born Latino males in neighborhoods with low mixed-land development had increased risk of non-aggressive disease (lowest vs. highest quintile HR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.07-2.09). For aggressive disease, the only association noted was between lower mixed-land development and lower risk among White males (Ptrend = 0.040).  Conclusions:   nSES and obesogenic environment factors were independently associated with prostate cancer risk; associations varied by race, ethnicity, nativity, and disease aggressiveness.

It was previously reported that the ethanol extract of SBD is able to promote apoptosis, and inhibit cell proliferation and angiogenesis in cancer.  Materials and methods:   CCK8, Edu assays and colony formation assay were performed to assess the effect of SBD on PCa cell growth. Effect of SBD on apoptosis and cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. Transwell and wounding healing assay were conducted to detect the invasion and migration activities of PCa cells. Western blot was employed to detect the protein expression. 2RRV1 mouse xenograft model was established to detect the effect of SBD on prostate cancer. Angiogenesis was analysed by coculturing PCa cell lines and HUVECs.  Results:   The results showed that SBD induced a significant decrease in cell viability and clonogenic growth in a dose-dependent manner. SBD induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle G2/M phase arrest by inactivating PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. Treatment with SBD also significantly decreased the cell migration and invasion via phenotypic inversion of EMT that was characterized by the increased expression of E-cadherin and Vimentin, and decreased expression of N-cadherin, which could be partially attributed to inhibiting PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. Subsequently, using AKT inhibitor MK2206, we concluded that PI3K/AKT are also involved in cell apoptosis and metastasis of PCa cells stimulated by SBD. Apart from its direct effects on PCa cells, SBD also exhibited anti-angiogenic properties. SBD alone or conditioned media from SBD-treated PCa cells reduced HUVEC tube formation on Matrigel without affecting HUVEC viability. Furthermore, 22RV1 xenograft C57BL/6 mice treated with SBD in vivo showed a significant inhibitory in tumour size and tumour weight without toxicity. In addition, administration with medium- or high-dose of SBD significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the damage to tumour tissues.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that SBD has the potential to develop into a safe and potent alternative therapy for PCa patients.""","""['Dongya Sheng#', 'Bei Zhao#', 'Wenjing Zhu#', 'Tiantian Wang', 'Yu Peng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Complement Med Ther""","""['Scutellaria barbata D.

Methods:   This retrospective study was conducted on 488 patients who underwent biparametric MRI (bp-MRI), including T2-weighted imaging (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of diffusion-weighted imaging, and having biopsy-proven prostate cancer between August 2011 and July 2015. Forty-two of the patients who underwent radical prostatectomy and the rest of 446 patients constitute the labeled and unlabeled datasets, respectively. A deep learning model was built to predict the density of epithelium, epithelial nuclei, stroma, and lumen from bp-MRI, called MR-driven tissue density. On both the labeled validation set and the whole unlabeled dataset, the quality of MR-driven tissue density and its relation to bp-MRI signal intensity were examined with respect to different histopathologic and radiologic conditions using different statistical analyses.  Results:   MR-driven tissue density and bp-MRI of 446 patients were evaluated. MR-driven tissue density was significantly related to bp-MRI (p < 0.05). The relationship was generally stronger in cancer regions than in benign regions. Regarding cancer grades, significant differences were found in the intensity of bp-MRI and MR-driven tissue density of epithelium, epithelial nuclei, and stroma (p < 0.05). Comparing MR true-negative to MR false-positive regions, MR-driven lumen density was significantly different, similar to the intensity of bp-MRI (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   MR-driven tissue density could serve as a reliable histopathological measure of the prostate on bp-MRI, leading to an improved understanding of prostate cancer and cancer progression.  Key points:   • Semi-supervised deep learning enables non-invasive and quantitative histopathology in the prostate from biparametric MRI. • Tissue density derived from biparametric MRI demonstrates similar characteristics to the direct estimation of tissue density from histopathology images. • The analysis of MR-driven tissue density reveals significantly different tissue compositions among different cancer grades as well as between MR-positive and MR-negative benign.""","""['Minh Nguyen Nhat To', 'Jin Tae Kwak']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Retraction Note: Biparametric MR signal characteristics can predict histopathological measures of prostate cancer.', 'Deep Learning Reconstruction Enables Highly Accelerated Biparametric MR Imaging of the Prostate.', 'Identification of prostate cancer using multiparametric MR imaging characteristics of prostate tissues referenced to whole mount histopathology.', 'T1 and T2 MR fingerprinting measurements of prostate cancer and prostatitis correlate with deep learning-derived estimates of epithelium, lumen, and stromal composition on corresponding whole mount histopathology.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

The interaction between AR and LPXN occurs in a ligand-dependent manner and has been reported that the LIM domain in the Leupaxin interacts with the LDB (ligand-binding domain) domain AR. However, no detailed study is available on how the LPXN interacts with AR and increases the (prostate cancer) PCa progression. Considering the importance of the novel co-activator, LPXN, the current study also uses state-of-the-art methods to provide atomic-level insights into the binding of AR and LPXN and the impact of the most frequent clinical mutations H874Y, T877A, and T877S on the binding and function of LPXN. Protein coupling analysis revealed that the three mutants favour the robust binding of LPXN than the wild type by altering the hydrogen bonding network. Further understanding of the binding variations was explored through dissociation constant prediction which demonstrated similar reports as the docking results. A molecular simulation approaches further revealed the dynamic features which reported variations in the dynamics stability, protein packing, hydrogen bonding network, and residues flexibility index. Furthermore, we also assessed the protein motion and free energy landscape which also demonstrated variations in the internal dynamics. The binding free energy calculation revealed -32.95 ± 0.17 kcal/mol for the wild type, for H874Y the total binding energy (BFE) was -36.69 ± 0.11 kcal/mol, for T877A the BFE was calculated to be -38.78 ± 0.17 kcal/mol while for T877S the BFE -41.16 ± 0.12 kcal/mol. This shows that the binding of LPXN is increased by these mutations which consequently increase the PCa invasion and motility.

It was thought to be an ideal target due to its lack of expression in most adult normal tissues and importance in cancer cell survival. However, it has been challenging to target survivin due to its ""undruggable"" nature. We previously attempted to target its dimerization domain with a hypothesis that inhibiting survivin dimerization would promote its degradation in proteasome, which led to identification of a lead small-molecule inhibitor, LQZ-7F. LQZ-7F consists of a flat tetracyclic aromatic core with labile hydrazone linking a 1,2,5-oxadiazole moiety. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that LQZ-7F could be developed as a prodrug because the labile hydrazone linker could be hydrolyzed, releasing the tetracyclic aromatic core. To this end, we synthesized the tetracyclic aromatic core (LQZ-7F1) using reported procedure and tested LQZ-7F1 for its biological activities. Here we show that LQZ-7F1 has a significantly improved potency with submicromolar IC50's and induces spontaneous apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. It also more effectively inhibits survivin dimerization and induces survivin degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner than LQZ-7F. We also show that the combination of LQZ-7F1 and docetaxel have strong synergism in inhibiting prostate cancer cell survival.

Risk factors for cuff erosion - pelvic radiation, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), high-grade prostate cancer (Gleason score ≥ 8) - were recorded for each patient. Presenting signs and symptoms of cuff erosion were grouped into three categories: obstructive symptoms, worsening incontinence, and localized scrotal inflammation (SI).  Results:   Of 893 men who underwent AUS placement during the study interval, 61 (6.8%) sustained cuff erosion. Most erosion patients (40/61, 66%) presented with scrotal inflammatory changes including tenderness, erythema, and swelling. Fewer men reported obstructive symptoms (26/61, 43%) and worsening incontinence (21/61, 34%).

Patients were divided into two groups according to the number of BM: Oligo-BM for those with five or fewer BMs and poly-BM for those with more than five BM. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated for serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to discriminate between oligo-BM and poly-BM groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression tests were performed to find independent predictors of poly-BM.  Results:   A total of 53 patients with a median age of 70 (range: 49-88) were included in the study. The median Gleason score of the patients was 8 (range: 6-10). Among the patients, 23 had solely OB-type; 10 had solely IM type; 12 had OB and IM type; four had IM and OL type, two had OB and OL type; one had solely OL type, and one had IM and OB and OL type BM. Oligo-BM was detected in 25 patients (47.2%) and poly-BM was detected in 28 patients (52.8%). In multivariate analyses, serum ALP levels ≥122U/L and PSA levels ≥85.4ng/mL were found to be independent predictors of poly-BM.

We previously demonstrated that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) arginine vasopressin receptor type1A (AVPR1A) is expressed in CRPC and promotes castration-resistant growth in vitro and in vivo. AVPR1A is part of a family of GPCR's including arginine vasopressin receptor type 2 (AVPR2). Interrogation of prostate cancer patient sample data revealed that coexpression of AVPR1A and AVPR2 is highly correlated with disease progression. Stimulation of AVPR2 with a selective agonist desmopressin promoted CRPC cell proliferation through cAMP/protein kinase A signaling, consistent with AVPR2 coupling to the G protein subunit alpha s. In contrast, blocking AVPR2 with a selective FDA-approved antagonist, tolvaptan, reduced cell growth. In CRPC xenografts, antagonizing AVPR2, AVPR1A, or both significantly reduced CRPC tumor growth as well as decreased on-target markers of tumor burden. Combinatorial use of AVPR1A and AVPR2 antagonists promoted apoptosis synergistically in CRPC cells. Furthermore, we found that castration-resistant cells produced AVP, the endogenous ligand for arginine vasopressin receptors, and knockout of AVP in CRPC cells significantly reduced proliferation suggesting possible AVP autocrine signaling. These data indicate that the AVP/arginine vasopressin receptor signaling axis represents a promising and clinically actionable target for CRPC.  Implications:   The arginine vasopressin signaling axis in CRPC provides a therapeutic window that is targetable through repurposing safe and effective AVPR1A and AVPR2 antagonists.""","""['Laine M Heidman', 'Nahuel Peinetti', 'Valeria A Copello', 'Kerry L Burnstein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Arginine vasopressin receptor 1a is a therapeutic target for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The kinesin KIF20A promotes progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer through autocrine activation of the androgen receptor.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Hyponatremia and Cancer: From Bedside to Benchside.', 'African Ancestry-Associated Gene Expression Profiles in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Underlie Altered Tumor Biology and Clinical Outcome in Women of African Descent.']"""

This study assesses the causes and risks of noncancer death with each follow-up time period after PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program were analyzed for noncancer causes of death in PCa patients from 2000 to 2016. The standard mortality ratio (SMR) was calculated for noncancer mortality.  Results:   Altogether, 752,352 patients with PCa were identified, and 180,862 (24.0%) died during follow-up. The largest proportion of deaths from noncancer causes (36%) occurred within 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. The most common causes of noncancer death are cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Compared with the general age-matched male population, patients with PCa had a higher risk of death from any noncancer cause within 5 years, in particular other infectious diseases and suicide and self-inflicted injury. However, the risk of death from noncancer causes of PCa for more than 5 years is lower, except for Alzheimer's disease and hypertension from 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. In addition, the risk of death from noncancer causes was influenced by treatment, ethnicity, and staging differences. In particular, compared with the general population, many noncancer causes of death have higher risk of death in patients with or without treatment within 1 to 5 years after diagnosis, whereas patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy (CTx) are not at high risk of death from COPD, pneumonia and influenza, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis, septicemia, and atherosclerosis.  Conclusion:   The risk of death from noncancer causes gradually decreased in all patients with PCa during each follow-up period after diagnosis In addition, the risk of dying from noncancer causes are influenced by differences in stage, ethnicity, and treatment. In particular, patients undergoing RP±RT/CTx and RT/CTx have a lower risk of death compared to the general population.

Furthermore, the availability of PSMA PET/CT offers an excellent tool for optimal patient selection for MDRT. This phase III randomised controlled trial will investigate the role of the addition of ADT to MDRT in oligo-recurrent PCa patients selected with PSMA PET/CT to enhance oncological outcome.  Methods:   Two hundred and eighty patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to the standard treatment arm (MDRT alone) or the experimental arm (MDRT + 6 months ADT).

Results:   TBx within the pan-segmental mid-apical lesions yielded 44% of csPCa.

Thus, miR-3622 is proposed as a suppressor for prostate cancer, but its role remains debatable. In the present study, we found that expression of miR-3622a was lower, whereas expression of miR-3622b-3p was higher in human prostate cancer tissues than in normal prostate tissues. miR-3622a-3p inhibited cell migration and invasion of human prostate cancer cells, whereas miR-3622b-3p facilitated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. To address the opposing roles of miR-3622 family members in various human prostate cancer cell lines, we knocked out (KO) endogenous miR-3622, including both miR-3622a/b. Our results showed that miR-3622 KO reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Functional analyses revealed that miR-3622 regulated the p53-downstream gene network, including AIFM2, c-MYC, and p21, to control apoptosis and the cell cycle. Furthermore, using CRISPR interference, miRNA/mRNA immunoprecipitation assays, and dual-luciferase assays, we established that AIFM2, a direct target of miR-3622b-3p, is responsible for miR-3622 KO-induced apoptosis. We identified an miR-3622-AIFM2 axis that contributes to oncogenic function during tumor progression. In addition, miR-3622 KO inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition involved in prostate cancer metastasis via upregulation of vimentin. The results show that miR-3622b-3p is upregulated in human prostate cancers and has an oncogenic function in tumor progression and metastasis via repression of p53 signaling, especially through an miR-3622-AIFM2 axis. In contrast, for human prostate cancer, deletion of the miR-3622 locus at 8p21 reduced the oncogenic effects on tumor progression and metastasis.""","""['Yue Zhang', 'Zhifang Xu', 'Wen Wen', 'Zhichao Liu', 'Chao Zhang', 'Ming Li', 'Fengping Hu', 'Shi Wei', 'Sejong Bae', 'Jiangbing Zhou', 'Runhua Liu', 'Lizhong Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['A novel microRNA regulator of prostate cancer epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'Novel tumor suppressor microRNA at frequently deleted chromosomal region 8p21 regulates epidermal growth factor receptor in prostate cancer.', 'Role of a novel race-related tumor suppressor microRNA located in frequently deleted chromosomal locus 8p21 in prostate cancer progression.', 'Mechanism and function of miR-140 in human cancers: A review and in silico study.', 'microRNA-205 in prostate cancer: Overview to clinical translation.', 'Rewired Metabolism Caused by the Oncogenic Deregulation of MYC as an Attractive Therapeutic Target in Cancers.', 'Targeting the p53 signaling pathway in cancers: Molecular mechanisms and clinical studies.']"""

The mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 3.38 with ADT alone and 3.92, 4.76, 3.92, and 5.01 with docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, enzalutamide, and apalutamide, added to ADT, respectively. As add-on therapy to ADT, docetaxel had an ICER of $42 069 per QALY over ADT alone; abiraterone acetate had an ICER of $58 814 per QALY over docetaxel; apalutamide had an ICER of $1 979 676 per QALY over abiraterone acetate; enzalutamide was dominated. At a willingness to pay below $50 000 per QALY, docetaxel plus ADT is likely the most cost-effective treatment; at any willingness to pay between $50 000 and $200 000 per QALY, abiraterone acetate plus ADT is likely the most cost-effective treatment.  Conclusions:   These findings underscore the value of abiraterone acetate plus ADT given its relative cost-effectiveness to other systemic treatments for metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.""","""['Lin Wang', 'Hwanhee Hong', 'G Caleb Alexander', 'Otis W Brawley', 'Channing J Paller', 'Jeromie Ballreich']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Value Health""","""[""Cost-effectiveness analysis of Abiraterone Acetate versus Docetaxel in the management of metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer: Hong Kong's perspective."", 'A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Survival modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Treatments for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: Systematic Review, Network Meta-analysis, and Benefit-harm assessment.', 'Cabazitaxel for Hormone-Relapsed Metastatic Prostate Cancer Previously Treated With a Docetaxel-Containing Regimen: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of a NICE Single Technology Appraisal.', 'Radiation therapy for prostate cancer in Syrian refugees: facing the need for change.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of serplulimab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment for PD-L1-positive esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China.', 'Economic evaluation of five first-line PD-(L)1 inhibitors for treating non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in China: A cost-effectiveness analysis based on network meta-analysis.']"""

We sought to provide an overview of the expected burden of cancer in Canada in 2022.  Methods:   We obtained data on new cancer incidence from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1984-1991) and Canadian Cancer Registry (1992-2018). Mortality data (1984-2019) were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics - Death Database. We projected cancer incidence and mortality counts and rates to 2022 for 22 cancer types by sex and province or territory. Rates were age standardized to the 2011 Canadian standard population.  Results:   An estimated 233 900 new cancer cases and 85 100 cancer deaths are expected in Canada in 2022. We expect the most commonly diagnosed cancers to be lung overall (30 000), breast in females (28 600) and prostate in males (24 600). We also expect lung cancer to be the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 24.3% of all cancer deaths, followed by colorectal (11.0%), pancreatic (6.7%) and breast cancers (6.5%). Incidence and mortality rates are generally expected to be higher in the eastern provinces of Canada than the western provinces.  Interpretation:   Although overall cancer rates are declining, the number of cases and deaths continues to climb, owing to population growth and the aging population. The projected high burden of lung cancer indicates a need for increased tobacco control and improvements in early detection and treatment. Success in breast and colorectal cancer screening and treatment likely account for the continued decline in their burden. The limited progress in early detection and new treatments for pancreatic cancer explains why it is expected to be the third leading cause of cancer death in Canada.""","""['Darren R Brenner', 'Abbey Poirier', 'Ryan R Woods', 'Larry F Ellison', 'Jean-Michel Billette', 'Alain A Demers', 'Shary Xinyu Zhang', 'Chunhe Yao', 'Christian Finley', 'Natalie Fitzgerald', 'Nathalie Saint-Jacques', 'Lorraine Shack', 'Donna Turner', 'Elizabeth Holmes;Canadian Cancer Statistics Advisory Committee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""CMAJ""","""['Projected estimates of cancer in Canada in 2020.', 'Long-term projections of cancer incidence and mortality in Canada: The OncoSim All Cancers Model.', '1992 Canadian Cancer Statistics.', 'Cancer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020: a review of current estimates of the national burden, data gaps, and future needs.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Are Canadian Women Prepared for the Transition to Primary HPV Testing in Cervical Screening?

Recent studies have shown that RNase H2 function is also needed for successful DNA repair through NHEJ events where DNA pol µ uses ribonucleotides during the gap filling stage. Mammalian RNase H2 is composed of three subunits, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B and RNASEH2C. There have been studies suggesting changes in expression of these genes in various cancers of breast, prostate, colon, liver, and kidney. In this study, we have investigated the functional role of RNASEH2A and RNASEH2B in leukemic T-cells, MOLT4 and Jurkat. shRNA mediated knockdown of RNASEH2A/ RNASEH2B expression led to reduced cell survival and increase in apoptotic cell population. Importantly, knockdown of RNASEH2A or RNASEH2B, led to cell cycle arrest at S phase and increased number of 53BP1 foci due to abrogation of NHEJ. Interestingly, RNASEH2A or RNASEH2B depleted cells showed significantly retarded DSB repair kinetics compared to scrambled shRNA control, when exposed to ionizing radiation suggesting that NHEJ is abrogated due to loss of RNASEH2 activity in T-ALL cells.

Material and methods:   Patients treated as part of 7 prospective clinical trials were included. All patients had low-or intermediate-risk PCa. Three strategies were considered: SABR, HDR monotherapy and HDR boost. HRQoL was prospectively measured at baseline and 12 months in all trials, using the Expanded Prostate Index Composite (EPIC). A minimally important difference (MID) was defined as a deterioration of HRQoL scores at 12 months compared to baseline ≥0.5 standard deviation of baseline score.

Other technical advances have progressively increased the quality of positron images. To date, the most widely used tracer remains FDG, which is highly beneficial in terms of sensitivity and specificity in detection of tumor sites, also providing biological information on tumors and early evaluation of treatment response for most cancers. Other highly specific tracers have been developed and are now routinely used for pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma, neuroendocrine tumors, and prostate cancer. Biological Radiotherapy has two aspects: Internal radiotherapy consisting in administration of a tumor-specific molecule radiolabeled with an isotope delivering an adequate radiation dose to the targeted tumor sites (on the model of thyroid cancer treated with radioiodine) and external radiotherapy designed to determine tumor volume, assess response and to dose radiation according to the tumor characteristics shown by functional imaging.""","""['Jean Lumbroso']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Presse Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Abass Alavi: A giant in Nuclear Medicine turns 80 and is still going strong!', 'Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography: A Guide for the General Radiologist.', 'How to use PET/CT in the evaluation of response to radiotherapy.']"""

In this study, we report that loss of tumor suppressor protein p53 or p63γ function or mutation of a putative p53 response element in the TRPM4 promoter region increase TRPM4 promoter activity in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT 116. In cells that lack p53 expression, we observed increased TRPM4 mRNA and protein levels and TRPM4-mediated Na+ currents. This phenotype can be reversed by transient overexpression of p53. In the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, which expresses p53 endogenously, p53 overexpression decreases TRPM4-mediated currents. As in other cancer cells, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knockout of TRPM4 in p53 deficient HCT 116 cells results in increased store-operated Ca2+entry. The effect of the TRPM4 knockout is mimicked by p53 mediated suppression of TRPM4 in the parental cell line expressing TRPM4. In addition, a TRPM4 knockout-mediated shift in cell cycle is abolished upon loss of p53. Taken together, these findings indicate that p53 represses TRPM4 expression, thereby altering cellular Ca2+ signaling and that TRPM4 adds to cell cycle shift dependent on p53 signaling.

Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing RP with lymphadenectomy by a single surgeon were randomized to pneumoperitoneum pressures of 6 mmHg vs 15 mmHg. Pain scores and opioid use were recorded every 2 hours until discharge. Groups underwent intention-to-treat analysis on the primary outcome of pain scores up to 8 hours after post-anesthesia care unit.  Results:   A total of 138 patients were randomized to RP at 6 mmHg or 15 mmHg (67 and 71, respectively). Mean console time was 7 minutes longer at 6 mmHg (135 vs 128 minutes, p=0.02). Mean estimated blood loss was similar (p=0.4) with no transfusions in either group. Most patients were discharged on the same day as surgery (88% vs 84%, p=0.5). There was no statistically significant difference observed in morphine equivalents administered during surgery or used postoperatively, yet 6 mmHg patients had lower immediate (0-4 hours) mean pain scores (2.1 vs 3.5, p <0.01) and lower maximum pain scores (3.0 vs 5.2, p <0.01). Shoulder pain was lower in 6 mmHg patients (0.03 vs 0.15, p=0.01), as was groin pain (0.6 vs 1.2 p=0.01). Patients reported flatus earlier with 6 mmHg (mean 1.0 day vs 1.3 days, p <0.01).

Two CpG sites of PMEPA1 were associated with overall survival, and one CpG site of PMEPA1 was associated with progression-free survival. The low level of PMEPA1 methylation was associated with advanced clinical stage of CC patients. KEGG assays revealed the genes associated with PMEPA1 expression were mainly enriched in several tumor-related pathways. Increased PMEPA1 expressions were observed to be positively related to high immune infiltration levels in several immune cells. Finally, the pan-cancer assays revealed that PMEPA1 expression was associated with the overall survival of UVM, PAAD, LUSC, BLCA, CESC, and LUAD. Taken together, PMEPA1 is a prognosis-related biomarker for multiple cancer types, especially CC.

The primary aim of this analysis is to report survival outcomes and pattern of recurrence of patients with hormone-sensitive (HSPC) and castrate-resistant (CRPC) oligometastatic prostate cancer treated with SABR.  Methods:   This is a single-center retrospective study of patients with oligometastatic prostate cancer treated in Iridium Network between 2014 and 2018. All patients with oligometastatic (≤3 active lesions) HSPC and CRPC treated with SABR were included. Data were collected using electronic records. Patterns of first progression following SABR were reported. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to determine survival outcomes.  Results:   Eighty-seven men received SABR to 115 metastases. Nineteen patients were castrate-resistant and 68 hormone-sensitive at the time of SABR. Median follow-up was 41.6 months. In 25% of patients, no decline from baseline PSA was recorded. Median bPFS was 11.7 months (95% CI 7.6 - 18.3) for HSPC as well as CRPC (95% CI 6.4 - 24.0) (p=0.27). Median DMFS was 21.8 (95% CI 16.9 - 43.2) versus 17.6 months (95% CI 6.7 - 26.2) for HSPC versus CRPC, respectively (p=0.018). Median OS was 72.6 months (95% CI 72.6 - not reached) for HSPC and not reached for CRPC (95% CI 35.4 months - not reached) (p=0.026). For the subgroup of oligorecurrent HSPC, short-term androgen-deprivation therapy was associated with improved bPFS (median 6.0 vs. 18.3 months, HR 0.31, p<0.001) and DMFS (median 15.8 vs 29.6 months, HR 0.5, p=0.06). Information on pattern of relapse was retrieved for 79 patients: 45% (36/79) of these patients were long-term disease-free (>18 months), 28% (22/79) of patients wmere oligoprogressive (≤3 new lesions) and 27% (21/79) developed a polymetastatic relapse.  Conclusion:   In this cohort, oligometastatic HSPC showed potential benefit from SABR with a median DMFS of 21.8 months. Well-selected patients with oligometastatic CRPC may also benefit from SABR. For patients with metachronous and repeat oligorecurrent HSPC, combining SABR with short-term androgen-deprivation therapy was associated with improved bPFS and DMFS. Overall, 36/87 (41%) of patients were still free from clinical relapse at 18 months.""","""['Carole Mercier', 'Marc Claessens', 'Bart De Troyer', 'Tibaut Debacker', 'Karen Fransis', 'Hendrik Vandeursen', 'Piet Ost', 'Piet Dirix']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Metastasis-directed Therapy Prolongs Efficacy of Systemic Therapy and Improves Clinical Outcomes in Oligoprogressive Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic ablative radiation therapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer delays time-to-next systemic treatment.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Outcomes of Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: The ORIOLE Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'The role of radiotherapy in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.']"""

Epithelial mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) has been associated with disease progression to CRPC, and prostate cancer therapies targeting the androgen signalling axis, including androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), promote EMP. We explored effects of castration on EMP in the tumours and circulating tumour cells (CTCs) of patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-bearing castrated mice using human-specific RT-qPCR assays and immunocytochemistry. Expression of prostate epithelial cell marker KLK3 was below detection in most tumours from castrated mice (62%, 23/37 mice), consistent with its known up-regulation by androgens. Endpoint tumour size after castration varied significantly in a PDX model-specific pattern; while most tumours were castration-sensitive (BM18, LuCaP70), the majority of LuCaP105 tumours continued to grow following castration. By contrast, LuCaP96 PDX showed a mixed response to castration. CTCs were detected in 33% of LuCaP105, 43% of BM18, 47% of LuCaP70, and 54% of LuCaP96 castrated mice using RPL32 mRNA measurement in plasma. When present, CTC numbers estimated using human RPL32 expression ranged from 1 to 458 CTCs per ml blood, similar to our previous observations in non-castrated mice. In contrast to their non-castrated counterparts, there was no relationship between tumour size and CTC burden in castrated mice. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the gene expression profiles of CTCs collected from castrated and non-castrated mice revealed distinct CTC sub-groups within the pooled population that were classified as having mesenchymal, epithelial, or EMP hybrid gene expression profiles. The epithelial signature was only found in CTCs from non-castrated mice. Hybrid and mesenchymal signatures were detected in CTCs from both castrated and non-castrated mice, with an emphasis towards mesenchymal phenotypes in castrated mice. Post-castration serum PSA levels were either below detection or very low for all the CTC positive samples highlighting the potential usefulness of CTCs for disease monitoring after androgen ablation therapy. In summary, our study of castration effects on prostate cancer PDX CTCs showed that CTCs were often detected in the castrate setting, even in mice with no palpable tumours, and demonstrated the superior ability of CTCs to reveal residual disease over the conventional clinical biomarker serum PSA.""","""['Sara Hassan', 'Tony Blick', 'Jack Wood', 'Erik W Thompson', 'Elizabeth D Williams']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Diversity of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Phenotypes in Circulating Tumour Cells from Prostate Cancer Patient-Derived Xenograft Models.', 'Phenotypes of circulating tumour cells predict time to castration resistance in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Human-specific RNA analysis shows uncoupled epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in circulating and disseminated tumour cells from human breast cancer xenografts.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Objective:   To study the prevalence of immune biomarkers of potential clinical utility to immunotherapy in mCRPC and to determine their association with overall survival (OS).  Design, setting, and participants:   From 100 patients, mCRPC biopsies were assayed by whole exome sequencing, targeted next-generation sequencing, RNA sequencing, tumor mutational burden, T-cell-inflamed gene expression profile (TcellinfGEP) score (Nanostring), and immunohistochemistry for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), SRY homology box 2 (SOX2), and the presence of neuroendocrine features.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The phi coefficient determined correlations between biomarkers of interest. OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) from Cox regression.  Results and limitations:   PD-L1 and SOX2 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry (combined positive score ≥1 and >5% cells, respectively) in 24 (33%) and 27 (27%) mCRPC biopsies, respectively; 23 (26%) mCRPC biopsies had high TcellinfGEP scores (>-0.318).

Methods and materials:   Treatment planning and optimization procedures were developed for spot-scanning hadron arc (SHArc) delivery using the RayStation treatment planning system and FRoG dose engine. The SHArc optimization algorithm is applicable for charged particle beams and determines angle dependencies for spot and energy selection with three main initiatives: (i) achieve standard clinical optimization goals and constraints for target and organs at risk (OARs), (ii) target dose robustness, and (iii) increase linear energy transfer (LET) in the target volume. Three patient cases previously treated at the Heidelberg Ion-beam Therapy Center (HIT) were selected for evaluation of conventional versus arc delivery for the two clinical particle beams (helium [4He] and carbon [12C] ions): glioblastoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, and skull-base chordoma. Biological dose and dose-averaged LET (LETd) distributions for SHArc were evaluated against conventional planning techniques (volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT] and 2-field intensity modulated particle therapy) applying the modified microdosimetric kinetic model with (α/β)x = 2 Gy. Clinical viability and deliverability were assessed via evaluation of plan quality, robustness, and irradiation time.  Results:   For all investigated patient cases, SHArc treatment optimizations met planning goals and constraints for target coverage and OARs, exhibiting acceptable target coverage and reduced normal tissue volumes, with effective dose >10-GyRBE compared with conventional 2F planning. For carbon ions, LETd was increased in the target volume from ∼40-60 to ∼80-140 keV/µm for SHArc compared with conventional treatments. Favorable LETd distributions were possible with the SHArc approach, with maximum LETd in clinical target volume/gross tumor volume and potential reductions of high-LET regions in normal tissues and OARs. Compared with VMAT, SHArc affords substantial reductions in normal tissue dose (40%-70%).  Conclusions:   SHArc therapy offers potential treatment benefits such as increased normal tissue sparing from higher doses >10-GyRBE, enhanced target LETd, and potential reduction in high-LET components in OARs.

Methods:   A series of 1, 3, 4-oxadiazole derivatives as PD176252 analogues (4a-4j, 6a-6q) were synthesized and their cytotoxic activity was investigated on four cancer lines with high expression of GRPR (gastric (HGC-27), colon (HCT- 116), prostate (PC-3), and lung (A549)) and one human cell line (gastric mucosal epithelial (GES-1)) by MTT assay. Flow cytometry analysis and Western Blot were used to determine whether the compound induced programmed apoptosis of cancer cells. Competitive binding experiment was used to verify the affinity between GRPR and the optimal compound.  Results:   Compound 6m exhibited significant growth inhibition on all tested cancer cell lines, especially gastric cancer cells (HGC-27 cellular IC50 0.37 ± 0.04μM). Also, the selectivity of 6m to HGC-27 was much higher than that of PD176252. Flow cytometric analysis and Western Blot proved that 6m significantly promoted the apoptosis of HGC- 27 cells. Moreover, competitive binding experiment confirmed the close binding of 6m with GRPR, which indicated 6m with a higher affinity than lead compound PD176252.  Conclusion:   Our results suggested that 6m, as a novel GRPR inhibitor, had a higher affinity with GRPR and potential anti-cancer effect than PD176252, which can be used as a template for further optimization.""","""['Yuting Zhu', 'Huai Wang', 'Mingjun Yu', 'Chao Li', 'Xiaoming Meng', 'Meng He', 'Risheng Yao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Dual Anti-cancer and Anti-Itch Activity of PD176252 Analogues: Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation.', 'Design, Synthesis and Bioactivity Evaluation of Novel Chalcone Derivatives Possessing Tryptophan Moiety with Dual Activities of Anti-Cancer and Partially Restoring the Proliferation of Normal Kidney Cells Pre-Treated with Cisplatin.', 'Novel diosgenin derivatives containing 1,3,4-oxadiazole/thiadiazole moieties as potential antitumor agents: Design, synthesis and cytotoxic evaluation.', 'Cytotoxic and Apoptotic Effects of Novel Pyrrolo2,3-dPyrimidine Derivatives Containing Urea Moieties on Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Antitumor mechanisms of combined gastrin-releasing peptide receptor and epidermal growth factor receptor targeting in head and neck cancer.']"""

Many studies also show that nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by NO synthases can function to promote tumor progression. However, the exact roles of NOSs and NO signaling in the growth regulation of PCSCs and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) are still not fully understood.  Methods:   The regulatory functions of NOS-NO signaling were evaluated in prostate cancer cells, especially in PCSCs enriched by 3D spheroid culture and CD133/CD44 cell sorting. The molecular mechanisms of NOS-NO signaling in PCSCs growth regulation and tumor metastasis were investigated in PCSCs and mice orthotopic prostate tumor model.  Results:   Endothelial NOS (eNOS) exhibited a significant upregulation in high-grade prostate cancer and metastatic CRPC. Xenograft models of CRPC exhibited notable increased eNOS expression and higher intracellular NO levels. PCSCs isolated from various models displayed significant enhanced eNOS-NO signaling. Functional analyses demonstrated that increased eNOS expression could promote in vivo tumorigenicity and metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells. Characterization of eNOS-NO involved downstream pathway which confirmed that enhanced eNOS signaling could promote the growth of PCSCs and antiandrogen-resistant prostate cancer cells via an activated downstream NO-sGC-cGMP-PKG effector signaling pathway. Interestingly, eNOS expression could be co-targeted by nuclear receptor ERRα and transcription factor ERG in prostate cancer cells and PCSCs.  Conclusions:   Enhanced eNOS-NO signaling could function to promote the growth of PCSCs and also the development of metastatic CRPC. Besides eNOS-NO as potential targets, targeting its upstream regulators (ERRα and ERG) of eNOS-NO signaling could also be the therapeutic strategy for the management of advanced prostate cancer, particularly the aggressive cancer carrying with the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene.""","""['Weijie Gao', 'Yuliang Wang', 'Shan Yu', 'Zhu Wang', 'Taiyang Ma', 'Andrew Man-Lok Chan', 'Peter Ka-Fung Chiu', 'Chi-Fai Ng', 'Dinglan Wu', 'Franky Leung Chan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Stem Cell Res Ther""","""['Nuclear receptor ERRα and transcription factor ERG form a reciprocal loop in the regulation of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene in prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear receptor profiling in prostatospheroids and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear receptor ERRα contributes to castration-resistant growth of prostate cancer via its regulation of intratumoral androgen biosynthesis.', 'New insights into prostate cancer stem cells.', 'Prostate cancer stem cells: deciphering the origins and pathways involved in prostate tumorigenesis and aggression.', ""Let's Go 3D!

Results:   There were a total of 39 patients (8.53%) with postoperative BNC. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that preoperative bladder neck diameter (BND), intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP), surgical methods (transurethral resection of prostate (TURP)/anatomical endoscopic enucleation of the prostate (AEEP)), and postoperative urinary tract infection (UTI) were independent risk factors for postoperative BNC in patients with small-volume prostatic obstruction (P < 0.05). The incidence of postoperative BNC in patients undergoing AEEP was significantly decreased compared with those undergoing TURP. The optimal cut-off value of preoperative IPP was 6.10 mm while the optimal cut-off value of preoperative BND was 2.52 cm.  Conclusions:   Larger preoperative bladder neck and higher preoperative IPP lead to decreased incidence of postoperative BNC in patients with small-volume prostatic obstruction.

Incidence rates of PCa have recently grown in Asian countries, partially due to the comprehensive implementation of early detection systems. Interestingly, a prospective cohort study showed that adopting a westernized dietary pattern was associated with a higher risk of being diagnosed with PCa among Korean and Japanese men. However, a comparison of current clinicopathological features of PCa between American and Chinese men is lacking. In this study, we report the current clinicopathological features of PCa in Chinese men and compare them to those of patients in the USA.  Materials and methods:   Case cohorts included, in total, 871 PCa cases with prostatectomy sequentially treated since 2017, including 299 cases from USA and 572 cases from two different academic hospitals in China. The parameters, including patient's age, preoperative Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) level, Gleason score, Grade Group, stage and tumor focality, were collected, analyzed and compared using two sample t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Pearson's Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Significant differences were demonstrated in the mean age of patients, preoperative PSA levels, extra-prostatic extension, Gleason scores, and Grade Groups (p < 0.05). PCa patients in the Chinese group were older than patients in the USA group (67.81 vs. 63.53, p < 0.01). The preoperative PSA levels in the Chinese group were higher than those in the USA group (11.69 v.s 6.30, p < 0.01). A higher percentage of high Grade Groups (Groups 4 and 5) was observed in the Chinese group (25.7%) compared to the USA cohort (17.11%), while Grade Group 2 was more common in the USA group than in the Chinese group (51.68% vs. 32.52%, p < 0.01).

Methods:   The study included 996 individuals aged ≥ 55 years who participated in routine postretirement physical examinations. Periodontal data included probing depth and gingival recession on four sites/tooth and on two diagonal quadrants (1-3 or 2-4) while excluding third molars, and clinical attachment loss was calculated. Periodontal status was classified as none, mild-moderate or severe periodontitis according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Periodontology case definition. Blood samples, oral health status and sociodemographic characteristics were collected by using general and oral examinations and questionnaires. Linear and logistic regressions were used to estimate the correlation between periodontitis severity and PSA levels, respectively.  Results:   A total of 479 men had mild-moderate periodontitis and 355 had severe periodontitis; 162 men were periodontally healthy individuals.

However, the link between immunodeficiency and prostate cancer progression remains unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of common genetic variants among eight immunodeficiency pathway-related genes on disease recurrence in prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Genetic and bioinformatic analyses on 19 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in eight immunodeficiency pathway-related genes were conducted in 458 patients with prostate cancer after receiving radical prostatectomy. Furthermore, the TNFRSF13B was knocked down in 22Rv1 and PC-3 human prostate cancer cell lines via transfecting short hairpin RNAs and cell proliferation and colony formation assays were performed. The molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TNFRSF13B were further explored by microarray gene expression profiling.  Results:   TNFRSF13B rs4792800 was found to be significantly associated with biochemical recurrence even after adjustment for clinical predictors and false discovery rate correction (adjusted hazard ratio 1.78, 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.71, p = 0.008), and the G allele was associated with higher TNFRSF13B expression (p = 0.038). Increased TNFRSF13B expression suggested poor prognosis in four independent prostate cancer datasets. Furthermore, silencing TNFRSF13B expression resulted in decreased colony formation of 22Rv1 and PC-3 cells through modulating the cell cycle and p53 signalling pathways.

Current non-invasive urianalysis relies on simultaneously testing multiple methylation markers to achieve relatively high accuracy. Therefore, we have developed an easy-to-use, convenient, and accurate single-target urine-based DNA methylation test for the malignancy.  Methods:   By analyzing TCGA data, 344 candidate markers with 424 primer pairs and probe sets synthesized were systematically screened in cancer cell lines, paired tissue specimens, and urine sediments from bladder cancer patients and normal controls. The identified marker was further validated in large case-control cohorts. Wilcoxon rank sum tests and c2 tests were performed to compare methylation levels between case-control groups and correlate methylation levels with demographic and clinical characteristics. In addition, MSP, qMSP, RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry were performed to measure levels of DNA methylation, mRNA transcription, and protein expression in cancer cell lines and tissues.  Results:   A top-performing DMRTA2 marker identified was tested in both discovery and validation sets, showing similar sensitivity and specificity for bladder cancer detection. Overall sensitivity in the aggregate set was 82.9%(179/216). The specificity, from a control group consisting of patients with lithangiuria, prostatoplasia, and prostatitis, is 92.5%(468/506). Notably, the methylation assay had the highest sensitivities for tumors at stages of T1(90.4%) and T2(95.0%) compared with Ta (63.0%), T3(81.8%), and T4(81.8%). Furthermore, the test showed admirable detection rate of 80.0%(24/30) for recurring cancers. While methylation was observed in 39/54(72.2%) urine samples from patients with carcinomas of renal pelvis and ureter, it was detected at extremely low rate of 6.0%(8/133) in kidney and prostate cancers. Compared with SV-HUC-1, the normal bladder epithelial cell line, DMRTA2 was hypermethylated in 8/9 bladder cancer cell lines, consistent with the results of MSP and qMSP, but not correlated with mRNA and protein expression levels in these cell lines. Similarly, DMRTA2 immunostaining was moderate in some tissues but weak in others. Further studies are needed to address functional implications of DMRTA2 hypermethylation.

All atomic representations in this study were created using visual molecular dynamics (VMD) tools. The result revealed that neither CBD nor THC bear significant 2D similarity with R18. Despite the diversity within the chemical space, both CBD and THC poses bond flexibility required to bind avidly to AR with the docking scores comparable to R18. In fully bound state, the three compounds engage the AR pocket hydrophobic residues such as L701, L704, and L707, and aromatic residues such as F764. Polar contacts with T877 observed in R18 bound state is avoided in the THC and CBD bound states. Moreso, the results revealed that CBD has lesser binding energy compared to THC and R18 compound which serves as standard.

The objective of this project was to determine if prostate MP-MRI and PSA can provide complementary insights into CSPC risk stratification.  Methods:   In an IRB-approved study, pathologic outcomes from patients who underwent MR/US fusion-targeted prostate biopsy were stratified by various parameters including PSA, PSA density (PSAD), age, race, and PI-RADS v2 score. CSPC was defined as a Gleason score ≥7. Logistic regression was used to determine odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). P values were reported as two-sided with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. ROC curves were generated for assessing the predictive value of tests and sensitivity + specificity optimization was performed to determine optimal testing cutoffs.  Results:   A total of 327 patients with 709 lesions total were analyzed. PSAD and PI-RADS scores provided complementary predictive value for diagnosis of CSPC (AUC PSAD: 0.67, PI-RADS: 0.72, combined: 0.78, p < 0.001). When controlling for PI-RADS score, age, and race, multivariate analysis showed that PSAD was independently associated with CSPC (OR 1.03 per 0.01 PSAD increase, 95% CI 1.02-105, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff of PSAD ≥ 0.1 ng/ml/cc shows that a high versus low PSAD was roughly equivalent to an increase in 1 in PI-RADS score for the presence of CSPC (4% of PI-RADS ≤3 PSAD low, 6% of PI-RADS 3 PSAD high vs. 5% of PI-RADS 4 PSAD low, 22% of PI-RADS 4 PSAD high vs. 29% of PI-RADS 5 PSAD low, 46% of PI-RADS 5 PSAD high were found to have CSPC).

Untreated mice succumbed to tumor by ~ 40 weeks, but survival was markedly prolonged by vaccine treatment, with most mice surviving past 80 weeks. Prostates in the treated mice were heavily infiltrated with T cells and iNKT cells, which both secreted IFNγ in response to tumor cells.

Results:   The largest differences were seen for late toxicities affecting the urinary tract. The 10-year cumulative incidences among those exposed to postoperative RT vs the RP-only group were: 17.8% vs 10.5% for procedures of the urinary tract (difference 7.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4 to 10.3; relative risk [RR] 1.74, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.05); 6.0% vs 1.2% for haematuria (difference 4.8%, 95% CI 3.1 to 6.5; RR 6.50, 95% CI 4.31 to 10.10); and 2.4% vs 1.1% for bladder cancer (difference 1.4%, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.3; RR 2.71, 95% CI 1.72 to 4.33).

Objective:   To investigate prediagnosis smoking habit (status, intensity, duration, and cessation) as a risk factor, on its own and combined with body mass index (BMI), for PCa incidence and death.  Design, setting, and participants:   We included 351448 men with smoking information from five Swedish cohorts.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We used Cox regression to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for PCa incidence (n = 24731) and death (n = 4322).  Results and limitations:   Smoking was associated with a lower risk of any PCa (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.86-0.92), which was most pronounced for low-risk PCa (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.69-0.79) and was restricted to PCa cases diagnosed in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) era. Smoking was associated with a higher risk of PCa death in the full cohort (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18) and in case-only analysis adjusted for clinical characteristics (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.31), which was a consistent finding across case groups (p = 0.8 for heterogeneity). Associations by smoking intensity and, to lesser degree, smoking duration and cessation, supported the associations for smoking status. Smoking in combination with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) further decreased the risk of low-risk PCa incidence (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.30-0.53 compared to never smokers with BMI <25 kg/m2) and further increased the risk of PCa death (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.21-1.84). A limitation of the study is that only a subgroup of men had information on smoking habit around the time of their PCa diagnosis.  Conclusions:   The lower PCa risk for smokers in the PSA era, particularly for low-risk PCa, can probably be attributed to low uptake of PSA testing by smokers. Poor survival for smokers, particularly obese smokers, requires further study to clarify the underlying causes and the preventive potential of smoking intervention for PCa death.

Currently, early detection involves screening for prostate-specific antigen levels in blood, which is not a tumor-specific biomarker. There is a critical need to develop clinically useful methods for screening for more reliable biomarkers. Here, we introduce an electrochemical biosensor that measures the concentrations of the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, and propose it as a possible diagnostic and prognostic tool for PCa.

There is a paucity of studies examining the interplay between green space, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and the incidence of specific cancers.  Objective:   We aimed to explore the contributions of green space and ambient PM2.5 to the risk of specific cancers in terms of the most common cancers based on incidence or mortality rate in Taiwan and to ascertain the interaction between green space and PM2.5 and their role in cancer risk.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective longitudinal cohort study included 407,415 participants. Data were obtained from the 2000-2015 Mei Jau Health Examination Database linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry and Causes of Death datasets. All participants were aged ≥20 years and had no history of cancer. The environmental exposure were the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the 2-year average PM2.5 at baseline. Multivariate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. We adjusted for covariates including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, health behaviors, biochemical data, and environmental factors.  Results:   During a median follow-up of 10.37 years, 11,576 cancer cases were reported. PM2.5 exposure increased the risk of all cancers (HR: 1.11, [95% CI: 1.06-1.15]), stomach cancer (HR: 1.27, [1.02-1.58]), endocrine gland cancer (HR: 2.13, [1.39-3.26]), breast cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.03-1.22]), and lung cancer (HR: 1.12, [1.01-1.24]). An increase in NDVI reduced the risk of prostate cancer (HR: 0.93, [0.88-0.99]) and lung cancer (HR: 0.95, [0.91-0.99]). NDVI influenced the incidence of prostate and all cancers by reducing PM2.5 concentrations.  Conclusion:   Long-term PM2.5 exposure is associated with an increased risk of some types of cancers. In contrast, an increase in environmental green space exposure is associated with lowering of the risk of prostate and lung cancer.""","""['Ying-Jhen Huang', 'Ping-Hsien Lee', 'Li-Chi Chen', 'Bo-Cheng Lin', 'Changqing Lin', 'Ta-Chien Chan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Environ Res""","""['Combined effects of heatwaves and air pollution, green space and blue space on the incidence of hypertension: A national cohort study.', 'A cohort study evaluating the risk of stroke associated with long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter in Taiwan.', 'Long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and associations with cardiopulmonary diseases and lung cancer in Taiwan: a nationwide longitudinal cohort study.', ""Does utilizing WHO's interim targets further reduce the risk - meta-analysis on ambient particulate matter pollution and mortality of cardiovascular diseases?"", 'Ambient Fine Particulate Matter and Cancer: Current Evidence and Future Perspectives.', 'Impact of Environmental Exposures on Lung Cancer in Patients Who Never Smoked.', 'Impact of social and economic factors on global thyroid cancer incidence and mortality.', 'Neighborhood deprivation, racial segregation and associations with cancer risk and outcomes across the cancer-control continuum.']"""

Such a process is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we show an end-to-end study to train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based virtual treatment planner (VTP) that can behave like a human to operate a dose-volume constrained treatment plan optimization engine following the parameters used in Eclipse TPS for high-quality treatment planning. We considered the prostate cancer IMRT treatment plan as the testbed. The VTP took the dose-volume histogram (DVH) of a plan as input and predicted the optimal strategy for constraint adjustment to improve the plan quality. The training of VTP followed the state-of-the-art Q-learning framework. Experience replay was implemented with epsilon-greedy search to explore the impacts of taking different actions on a large number of automatically generated plans, from which an optimal policy can be learned. Since a major computational cost in training was to solve the plan optimization problem repeatedly, we implemented a graphical processing unit (GPU)-based technique to improve the efficiency by 2-fold. Upon the completion of training, the established VTP was deployed to plan for an independent set of 50 testing patient cases. Connecting the established VTP with the Eclipse workstation via the application programming interface, we tested the performance the VTP in operating Eclipse TPS for automatic treatment planning with another two independent patient cases. Like a human planner, VTP kept adjusting the planning objectives/constraints to improve plan quality until the plan was acceptable or the maximum number of adjustment steps was reached under both scenarios. The generated plans were evaluated using the ProKnow scoring system. The mean plan score (± standard deviation) of the 50 testing cases were improved from 6.18 ± 1.75 to 8.14 ± 1.27 by the VTP, with 9 being the maximal score. As for the two cases under Eclipse dose optimization, the plan scores were improved from 8 to 8.4 and 8.7 respectively by the VTP. These results indicated that the proposed DRL-based VTP was able to operate the in-house dose-volume constrained TPS and Eclipse TPS to automatically generate high-quality treatment plans for prostate cancer IMRT.""","""['Damon Sprouts', 'Yin Gao', 'Chao Wang', 'Xun Jia', 'Chenyang Shen', 'Yujie Chi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""['Improving efficiency of training a virtual treatment planner network via knowledge-guided deep reinforcement learning for intelligent automatic treatment planning of radiotherapy.', 'Operating a treatment planning system using a deep-reinforcement learning-based virtual treatment planner for prostate cancer intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatment planning.', 'Implementation and evaluation of an intelligent automatic treatment planning robot for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy.', 'A hierarchical deep reinforcement learning framework for intelligent automatic treatment planning of prostate cancer intensity modulated radiation therapy.', 'Application programming in C# environment with recorded user software interactions and its application in autopilot of VMAT/IMRT treatment planning.', 'Research progress on deep learning in magnetic resonance imaging-based diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review on the current status and perspectives.']"""

However, a couple of years after treatment, prostate tumors transition into an androgen-independent state with altered gene expression profiles, but the molecular basis is not understood. Since the AR antagonists trigger this transition, we assessed whether AR antagonists induce chromatin reorganization in an androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP). Treatment of LNCaP cells with two clinically used AR antagonists (bicalutamide [Bic] and enzalutamide [Enz]) expectedly resulted in antagonistic effects on cell proliferation, AR transactivation, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced expression of AR target genes. Thus, the antagonists expectedly acted to antagonize the transactivation function of AR activated by androgen binding. By ChIP-qPCR assay, AR bound to Bic, but not Enz, was recruited to an endogenous consensus AR-binding site within the kallikrein-related peptidase 3 gene promoter after treatment with Bic, similar to the effect of DHT. By ATAC-seq analysis of the cells after long-term treatment for 5 days, Bic and dihydrotestosterone DHT induced different chromatin reorganization patterns and gene expression profiles, suggesting that Bic exhibited a distinct action from that by DHT. Thus, these results suggest that the action of a known AR antagonist is mediated by chromatin reorganization in a prostate cancer cell line.""","""['Takahiro Sawada', 'Yoshiaki Kanemoto', 'Rei Amano', 'Akira Hayakawa', 'Tomohiro Kurokawa', 'Jinichi Mori', 'Shigeaki Kato']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'Effects of treatment with androgen receptor ligands on microRNA expression of prostate cancer cells.', 'Resveratrol inhibits DHT-induced progression of prostate cancer cell line through interfering with the AR and CXCR4 pathway.', 'Corepressive function of nuclear receptor coactivator 2 in androgen receptor of prostate cancer cells treated with antiandrogen.', 'The androgen receptor messenger RNA: what do we know?', 'The epigenetic function of androgen receptor in prostate cancer progression.', 'A β-Cyclodextrin-Based Nanoparticle with Very High Transfection Efficiency Unveils siRNA-Activated TLR3 Responses in Human Prostate Cancer Cells.']"""

Pre-diagnostic prescription of statins and TTh was ascertained for this analysis and examined in two matched cohorts. Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the independent and joint associations of statins and TTh with CVD.  Results:   We found that independently statins (OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.44-0.53) and TTh (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.0.61-0.90) were each inversely associated with CVD in the overall sample.

The score was derived from seven dietary indicators which have been reported to lower cholesterol levels: high intake of non-cellulosic polysaccharides (viscous fibres), monounsaturated fatty acids, legumes, seeds/corn oil; low intake of saturated fatty acids, dietary cholesterol, and glycaemic index. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated through the unconditional logistic regression model. Although most of the dietary indicators alone were not significantly associated with reduced PCa risk, men who fulfilled 5 to 7 dietary indicators (187 cases and 281 controls) showed a 43% reduction in PCa risk compared to those with 0 to 2 indicators (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.43-0.77).

Recognition is achieved through synthetic bifunctional molecules that use covalency to stably bridge endogenous hapten-specific antibodies like anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP), with tumor antigens on cancer cell surfaces. To recruit these antibodies, cARMs are equipped with the native hapten-binding molecule. The majority of cancer-killing immune machinery, however, recognizes epitopes on protein ligands and not small molecule haptens (e.g., Fc receptors, pathogen-specific antibodies). To access this broader class of immune machinery for recruitment, we developed a covalent immune proximity-inducing strategy. This strategy uses synthetic bifunctional electrophilic peptides derived from the native protein ligand. These bifunctional peptides are engineered to contain both a tumor-targeting molecule and a sulfonyl (VI) fluoride exchange (SuFEx) electrophile. As a proof of concept, we synthesized bifunctional electrophilic peptides derived from glycoprotein D (gD) on herpes simplex virus (HSV), to recruit gD-specific serum anti-HSV antibodies to cancer cells expressing the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). We demonstrate that serum anti-HSV antibodies can be selectively and irreversibly targeted by these electrophilic peptides and that the reaction rate can be uniquely enhanced by tuning SuFEx chemistry without a loss in selectivity. In cellular assays, electrophilic peptides demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor immunotherapeutic efficacy compared to analogous peptides lacking electrophilic functionality. This enhanced efficacy was especially prominent in the context of (a) natural anti-HSV antibodies isolated from human serum and (b) harder to treat tumor cells associated with lower PSMA expression levels. Overall, we demonstrate a new covalent peptide-based approach to immune proximity induction and reveal the potential utility of anti-viral antibodies in synthetic tumor immunotherapy.""","""['Harrison M McCann', 'Benjamin P M Lake', 'Kyle S Hoffman', 'Maria E Davola', 'Karen L Mossman', 'Anthony F Rullo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ACS Chem Biol""","""['A covalent opsonization approach to enhance synthetic immunity against viral escape variants.', 'Covalent Stabilization of Antibody Recruitment Enhances Immune Recognition of Cancer Targets.', 'Monoclonal Antibodies, Derived from Humans Vaccinated with the RV144 HIV Vaccine Containing the HVEM Binding Domain of Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Glycoprotein D, Neutralize HSV Infection, Mediate Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity, and Protect Mice from Ocular Challenge with HSV-1.', 'Envelope and membrane glycoproteins of Herpes simplex virus.', 'Live vaccinia virus recombinants expressing herpes simplex virus genes.', 'A covalent opsonization approach to enhance synthetic immunity against viral escape variants.', 'Rapid Covalent Labeling of Membrane Proteins on Living Cells Using a Nanobody-Epitope Tag Pair.']"""

We defined receipt of recommended surveillance according to the collaborative's low-intensity criteria as: annual prostate specific antigen testing and either magnetic resonance imaging or prostate biopsy every 3 years. We assessed receipt of recommended surveillance among men with ≥36 months of followup (246). We conducted multilevel analyses to examine the influence of the urologist, urologist and primary care provider visits, and patient demographic and clinical factors on variation in receipt.  Results:   During 3 years of active surveillance, just over half of men (56.5%) received all recommended surveillance testing (69.9% annual prostate specific antigen testing, 72.8% magnetic resonance imaging/biopsy). We found 19% of the variation in receipt was attributed to individual urologists. While increasing provider visits were not significantly associated with receipt, older men were less likely to receive magnetic resonance imaging/biopsy (≥75 vs <55 years, adjusted odds ratio 0.07; 95% confidence interval 0.01-0.81).

Historically, intraductal carcinoma of the prostate (IDC-P) was postulated to be a retrograde spread of high-grade invasive prostate cancer. There is evidence that IDC-P can primarily originate in the prostatic ducts. The retrograde genesis has never been experimentally or clinically confirmed before. Methods. Biopsy proven intermediate or high-risk prostate cancer was orthotopically grafted in the prostate of severe combined immunodeficiency gamma mice. Cancer growth was monitored by serum PSA levels. The animals were sacrificed and grafted areas were histological examined. Results. Twenty-one of 23 mice survived and demonstrated rising serum PSA. In 10 of 21 animals, human prostate cancer was identified orthotopically. Except for one case where the human biopsy showed a Grade Group 2 prostate cancer and mouse graft was Grade Group 5, other 9 specimens showed comparable grades. One of the specimens demonstrated a cribriform invasive prostate cancer and adjacent IDC-P. Conclusion. These experimental data offer some evidence that invasive prostate cancer can demonstrate a retrograde spread in the prostatic ducts as IDC-P.

Although sex steroids may play a role in this discordance, no definitive genetic data exist to support androgen-mediated immune suppression neither for viral susceptibility nor for adrenally produced androgens.  Objective:   The common adrenal-permissive missense-encoding variant HSD3B1(1245C) that enables androgen synthesis from adrenal precursors and that has been linked to suppression of inflammation in severe asthma was investigated in COVID susceptibility and outcomes reported in the UK Biobank.  Methods:   The UK Biobank is a long-term study with detailed medical information and health outcomes for over 500 000 genotyped individuals. We obtained COVID test results, inpatient hospital records, and death records and tested for associations between COVID susceptibility or outcomes and HSD3B1(1245A/C) genotype. Primary analyses were performed on the UK Biobank Caucasian cohort. The outcomes were identification as a COVID case among all subjects, COVID positivity among COVID-tested subjects, and mortality among subjects identified as COVID cases.  Results:   Adrenal-permissive HSD3B1(1245C) genotype was associated with identification as a COVID case (odds ratio (OR): 1.11 per C allele, 95% CI: 1.04-1.18, P = 0.0013) and COVID-test positivity (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.02-1.17, P = 0.011) in older (≥70 years of age) women. In women identified as COVID cases, there was a positive linear relationship between age and 1245C allele frequency (P < 0.0001). No associations were found between genotype and mortality or between genotype and circulating sex hormone levels.

The pyroptosis-related genes could divide PCa patients into two clusters with differences in survival. Seven genes were determined to construct a signature that was confirmed by qRT-PCR to be closely associated with the biological characteristics of malignant PCa. The signature could effectively and independently predict the biochemical recurrence (BCR) of PCa, which was validated in the GSE116918 and GSE21034. We found that patients in the high-risk group were more prone to BCR and closely associated with high-grade and advanced-stage disease progression. Outperforming clinical characteristics and nine published articles, our signature demonstrated excellent predictive performance. The patients in the low-risk group were strongly related to the high infiltration of various immune cells including CD8+ T cells and plasma B cells. Furthermore, the high-risk group with higher TMB levels and expression of immune checkpoints was more likely to benefit from immune checkpoint therapy such as PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors.

Supramolecular light-harvesting systems have been used for imaging in some organelles such as lysosome, Golgi apparatus, and mitochondrion, but developing a supramolecular light-harvesting platform for imaging two organelles synchronously still remains a great challenge. Here, we report a series of lower-rim dodecyl-modified sulfonato-calix[4]arene-mediated supramolecular light-harvesting platforms for efficient light-harvesting from three naphthalene diphenylvinylpyridiniums containing acceptors, Nile Red, and Nile Blue. All of the constructed supramolecular light-harvesting systems possess high light-harvesting efficiency. Furthermore, when the two acceptors are loaded simultaneously in a single light-harvesting donor system for imaging in human prostate cancer cells, organelle imaging in lysosome and Golgi apparatus can be realized at the same time with distinctive wavelength emission. Nile Red receives the light-harvesting energy from the donors, reaching orange emissions (625 nm) in lysosome while Nile Blue shows a near-infrared light-harvesting emission at 675 nm in Golgi apparatus in the same cells.

Although prostate cancer antigen (PSA) is widely used in prostate cancer screening, the false positives may result in unnecessary invasive procedures. PSA elevated patients are triaged to further evaluation of free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA), to find out potential clinically significant PCa before undergoing invasive procedures. Genomic instability, especially chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) were proved much more tumor specific. Here we performed a prospective study to evaluate the diagnostic value of CNV via urine-exfoliated cell DNA analysis in PCa.  Methods:   We enrolled 28 PSA elevated patients (≥ 4 ng/ml), including 16 PCa, 9 benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) and 3 prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN). Fresh initial portion urine was collected after hospital admission. Urine exfoliated cell DNA was analyzed by low coverage Whole Genome Sequencing, followed by CNV genotyping by the prostate cancer chromosomal aneuploidy detector (ProCAD). CNVs were quantified in absolute z-score (|Z|). Serum free/total PSA ratio (f/t PSA) was reported altogether.  Results:   In patients with PCa, the most frequent CNV events were chr3q gain (n = 2), chr8q gain (n = 2), chr2q loss (n = 4), and chr18q loss (n = 3). CNVs were found in 81.2% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 53.7-95.0%) PCa. No CNV was identified in BPH patients. A diagnosis model was established by incorporating all CNVs. At the optimal cutoff of |Z|≥ 2.50, the model reached an AUC of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83-0.99), a sensitivity of 81.2% and a specificity of 100%. The CNV approach significantly outperformed f/t PSA (AUC = 0.62, P = 0.012). Further analyses showed that the CNV positive rate was significantly correlated with tumor grade. CNVs were found in 90.9% (95% CI 57.1-99.5%) high grade tumors and 60.0% (95% CI 17.0-92.7%) low grade tumors. No statistical significance was found for patient age, BMI, disease history and family history.  Conclusions:   Urine exfoliated cells harbor enriched CNV features in PCa patients.

However, there are limited data from China where cancer rates and levels of dairy consumption differ importantly from those in Western populations.  Methods:   The prospective China Kadoorie Biobank study recruited ~0.5 million adults from ten diverse (five urban, five rural) areas across China during 2004-2008. Consumption frequency of major food groups, including dairy products, was collected at baseline and subsequent resurveys, using a validated interviewer-administered laptop-based food frequency questionnaire. To quantify the linear association of dairy intake and cancer risk and to account for regression dilution bias, the mean usual consumption amount for each baseline group was estimated via combining the consumption level at both baseline and the second resurvey. During a mean follow-up of 10.8 (SD 2.0) years, 29,277 incident cancer cases were recorded among the 510,146 participants who were free of cancer at baseline. Cox regression analyses for incident cancers associated with usual dairy intake were stratified by age-at-risk, sex and region and adjusted for cancer family history, education, income, alcohol intake, smoking, physical activity, soy and fresh fruit intake, and body mass index.  Results:   Overall, 20.4% of participants reported consuming dairy products (mainly milk) regularly (i.e. ≥1 day/week), with the estimated mean consumption of 80.8 g/day among regular consumers and of 37.9 g/day among all participants.

The ERG rearrangement status in prostatic adenocarcinoma currently cannot be reliably identified from histologic features on H&E-stained slides alone and hence requires ancillary studies such as immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or next generation sequencing (NGS) for identification.  Methods:   OBJECTIVE: We accordingly sought to develop a deep learning-based algorithm to identify ERG rearrangement status in prostatic adenocarcinoma based on digitized slides of H&E morphology alone.  Design:   Setting, and Participants: Whole slide images from 392 in-house and TCGA cases were employed and annotated using QuPath. Image patches of 224 × 224 pixel were exported at 10 ×, 20 ×, and 40 × for input into a deep learning model based on MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network architecture pre-trained on ImageNet. A separate model was trained for each magnification. Training and test datasets consisted of 261 cases and 131 cases, respectively. The output of the model included a prediction of ERG-positive (ERG rearranged) or ERG-negative (ERG not rearranged) status for each input patch.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Various accuracy measurements including area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the deep learning model.  Results and limitations:   All models showed similar ROC curves with AUC results ranging between 0.82 and 0.85.

AA induces cellular senescence and inhibits CRPC tumour growth in in vivo xenograft mouse model associated with reduced neo-angiogenesis suggesting the repression of intratumoural neo-angiogenesis by AA. In line with this, the secretome of CRPC cells mediates neo-angiogenesis in an androgen-dependent manner, which is counteracted by AA. This was confirmed by two in vitro models using primary human endothelial cells. Transcriptome sequencing revealed upregulated angiogenic pathways by androgen, being however VEGF-independent, and pointing to the pro-angiogenic factor angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2) as a key driver of neo-angiogenesis induced by androgens and repressed by AA. In agreement with this, AA treatment of native patient-derived PCa tumour samples ex vivo inhibits ANGPT2 expression. Mechanistically, in addition to AA, immune-depletion of ANGPT2 from secretome or blocking ANGPT2-receptors inhibits androgen-induced angiogenesis.

Methods: In a prospective study from April 2016 to December 2020, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI was performed in men with a new diagnosis of intermediate- or high-grade prostate cancer who were candidates for prostatectomy. Patients were followed up after initial therapy for up to 5 y. We examined the Kendall correlation between PET (intense uptake in the primary lesion and presence of metastatic disease) and clinical and pathologic findings (grade group, extraprostatic extension, nodal involvement) relevant for risk stratification, and examined the relationship between PET findings and outcome using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Seventy-three men (age, 64.0 ± 6.3 y) were imaged. Seventy-two had focal uptake in the prostate, and in 20 (27%) PSMA-avid metastatic disease was identified. Uptake correlated with grade group and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Presence of PSMA metastasis correlated with grade group and pathologic nodal stage. PSMA PET had higher per-patient positivity than nodal dissection in patients with only 5-15 nodes removed (8/41 vs. 3/41) but lower positivity if more than 15 nodes were removed (13/21 vs. 10/21). High uptake in the primary lesion (SUVmax > 12.5, P = 0.008) and presence of PSMA metastasis (P = 0.013) were associated with biochemical failure, and corresponding hazard ratios for recurrence within 2 y (4.93 and 3.95, respectively) were similar to or higher than other clinicopathologic prognostic factors.

SNPs rs2702185 and rs73055188 were tested for association with prostate cancer-specific survival time using a multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. SNP rs2702185 was further tested for association with time to biochemical recurrence and time from biochemical recurrence to death with a multi-state model.  Results:   SNP rs2702185 at SMG7 was associated with prostate cancer-specific survival time, specifically the time from biochemical recurrence to prostate cancer death (HR, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.5; P = 0.0014). Nine variants were in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs2702185; one, rs10737246, was found to be most likely to be functional based on LD patterns and overlap with open chromatin. Patterns of open chromatin and correlation with gene expression suggest that this SNP may affect expression of SMG7 in T cells.  Conclusions:   The SNP rs2702185 at the SMG7 locus is associated with time from biochemical recurrence to prostate cancer death, and its LD partner rs10737246 is predicted to be functional.  Impact:   These results suggest that future association studies of prostate cancer survival should consider various intervals over the course of disease.""","""['Xiaoyu Song', 'Meng Ru', 'Zoe Steinsnyder', 'Kaitlyn Tkachuk', 'Ryan P Kopp', 'John Sullivan', 'Zeynep H Gümüş', 'Kenneth Offit', 'Vijai Joseph', 'Robert J Klein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev""","""['Genome-wide Scan Identifies Role for AOX1 in Prostate Cancer Survival.', 'Prognostic significance of prostate cancer susceptibility variants on prostate-specific antigen recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Susceptibility loci associated with prostate cancer progression and mortality.', 'The Impact of Downgrading from Biopsy Gleason 7 to Prostatectomy Gleason 6 on Biochemical Recurrence and Prostate Cancer Specific Mortality.', 'Prognostic Factors for Biochemical Recurrence More than 10 Years after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Low Expression of TSTD2 Serves as a Biomarker for Poor Prognosis in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.']"""

However, communication and collaboration between oncologists and PCPs are lacking. Therefore, we assessed the perception of cancer survivor care among PCPs.  Methods:   We sent a questionnaire to 767 Japanese Board-certified PCPs, regardless of facility type (clinics and hospitals), inquiring about PCPs' perceptions of their role in survivor care. Additionally, we included vignette-based scenarios focused on colorectal and prostate cancer survivors to explore factors associated with their clinical decisions.  Results:   We obtained 91 replies (response rate: 11.9%). A total of 75% of PCPs had encountered at least 1 cancer patient in actual practice. Even for patients actively receiving cancer treatment, >70% of PCPs reported that they were willing to engage in comprehensive survivor care, except for the administration of anticancer drugs. Further, 49% of PCPs considered that both PCPs and oncologists were suited to performing regular screening for cancer recurrence in high-risk patients. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that clinic PCPs were less inclined to conduct screening for recurrence than hospital PCPs in both colorectal (odds ratio, 3.85 [95% confidence interval 1.40-10.6]) and prostate (4.36 [95% confidence interval 1.51-12.6]) cancer scenarios.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that Japanese PCPs are willing to engage in survivor care and encourage closer collaboration between oncologists and PCPs.

It catalyzes histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) leading to repressive chromatin status (heterochromatin). Following demethylation and acetylation of H3 protein (H3K27ac) the result is transcriptionally activated status (euchromatin), a key metastasis facilitator being targeted by ongoing clinical trials, as with palbociclib. Here, we performed the first immunohistochemical study of H3K27ac expression in prostatic tissue and cancer metastasis, and determined a possible correlation with EZH2 expression.  Methods:   Tissue microarrays were made and immunohistochemistry was performed for EZH2 and H3K27ac. Slides were scanned and image data utilized a software-assisted, unbiased quantification method. The software captured diaminobenzidine positive regions, and tissue areas.  Results:   Benign prostate tissue expressed almost no EZH2 but showed strong H3K27-Ac positivity. Tumor was EZH2 positive (p < 0.05 vs. benign) with strongest staining in lymph node metastasis. H3K27-Ac was decreased in tumors, yet paradoxically had stagewise and gradewise progressive increases (both p < 0.05), with the strongest staining in lymph nodes. The overall relationship of EZH2 and H3K27ac was weakly correlated (r = 0.28, p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   EZH2 and H3K27ac had an inverse correlation in benign versus (especially) low-grade and low-stage prostate cancers; however, in high-stage and high-grade cancers and metastases, H3K27ac increased significantly.

We examined how adiposity relates to fatal prostate cancer and described the cross-sectional associations of commonly used adiposity measurements with adiposity estimated by imaging in UK Biobank. We also conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to integrate the new data with existing prospective evidence.  Methods:   218,237 men from UK Biobank who were free from cancer at baseline were included. Body mass index (BMI), total body fat percentage (using bioimpedance), waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were collected at recruitment. Risk of dying from prostate cancer (primary cause) by the different adiposity measurements was estimated using multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Results from this and other prospective cohort studies were combined in a dose-response meta-analysis.  Results:   In UK Biobank, 661 men died from prostate cancer over a mean follow-up of 11.6 years. In the subsample of participants with magnetic resonance imaging and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, BMI, body fat percentage and WC were strongly associated with imaging estimates of total and central adiposity (e.g. visceral fat, trunk fat). The hazard ratios (HR) for prostate cancer death were 1.07 (95% confidence interval = 0.97-1.17) per 5 kg/m2 higher BMI, 1.00 (0.94-1.08) per 5% increase in total body fat percentage, 1.06 (0.99-1.14) per 10 cm increase in WC and 1.07 (1.01-1.14) per 0.05 increase in WHR. Our meta-analyses of prospective studies included 19,633 prostate cancer deaths for BMI, 670 for body fat percentage, 3181 for WC and 1639 for WHR, and the combined HRs for dying from prostate cancer for the increments above were 1.10 (1.07-1.12), 1.03 (0.96-1.11), 1.07 (1.03-1.11), and 1.06 (1.01-1.10), respectively.

We charted these reprogrammed AR sites and identified genes proximal to them. We were able to devise gene lists based on AR status within specific histological contexts: normal prostate epithelium, primary prostate tumor, and metastatic prostate cancer. We evaluated expression of the genes in these gene sets in subjects from two distinct clinical cohorts-men treated with surgery for localized prostate cancer and men with metastatic prostate cancer. Among men with localized prostate cancer, expression of genes proximal to AR sites lost in the transition from normal prostate to prostate tumor was associated with clinical outcome. Among men with metastatic disease, expression of genes proximal to AR sites gained in metastatic tumors was associated with clinical outcome.

The μAEs consist of 9 × 10 micropillars with a height of either 100 μm, 300 μm, or 500 μm in a 0.09 cm2 region. Numerical simulation was employed to study the influence of geometrical parameters on the current density. The μAEs were fabricated by soft lithography and characterized using both SEM and cyclic voltammetry. Experiments revealed that high pillars enabled enhanced voltammetric current density regardless of the scan rates. The platinum-palladium/multi-walled carbon nanotubes (Pt-Pd/MWCNTs) were coated on the μAEs to improve their electrochemical detection capability. The μAEs demonstrated 1.5 times larger sensitivity compared with the planar electrode when hydrogen peroxide was detected. Furthermore, μAE500 with Pt-Pd/MWCNTs was employed to detect sarcosine, a potential biomarker for prostate cancer. The linear range and limit of detection for sarcosine were from 5 to 60 μM and 1.28 μM, respectively. This detection range covers the concentration of sarcosine in human tissues (0-60 μM). These results suggest that the μAEs have better detection performance in comparison to planar electrodes due to their large surface area and pillar height.

MDA-MB-231 cell spiked samples showed higher standard deviation, but the system captured 55 ± 16 cells, which is a sufficient number of cells for subsequent analyses. Further, this herringbone chip design has been shown to be compatible with an erythrocyte lysis chip we have described in previous studies. This circuit was capable of capturing 510 ± 120 cells with a purity of 82 ± 14% using <7 μL of a whole blood sample spiked with 10% MDA-MB-231 cells.

Emerging evidence indicates significance of hypoxia and immunity in PCa invasion and metastasis. This study aimed to develop a hypoxia- and immune-related gene risk signature and explore the molecular mechanisms to formulate a better prognostic tool for PCa patients.  Methods:   The hypoxia and immune scores of all PCa patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset were calculated via the maximally selected rank statistics method and the ESTIMATE algorithm. From common genes identified overlapping hypoxia- and immune-related differentially expressed genes (DE-HRGs and DE-IRGs), a hypoxia- and immune-related gene risk signature was developed utilizing univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, and validated in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre (MSKCC) database. The immune cell infiltration level of PCa samples were evaluated with ssGSEA algorithm. Differential expression of prognostic genes was evidenced by immunohistochemistry and western blot (WB) in paired PCa samples. Expression levels of these genes and their variations under regular and hypoxic conditions were examined in cell lines. The functional effects of the prognostic gene on PCa cells were examined by wound healing and transwell assays.  Results:   A hypoxia- and immune-related gene risk signature constructed by ISG15 and ZFP36 displays significant predictive potency, with higher risk score representing worse survival. A nomogram based on independent prognostic factors including the risk score and Gleason score exhibited excellent clinical value in the survival prediction of PCa.

Conversely, aDC, pDC, T helper cells, and Tregs were significantly higher. Additionally, the two prognostic genes were closely correlated with the tumor-infiltrating immune cell subset in PCa progression. RT-qPCR and WB presented higher and lower expression of ISG15 and ZFP36 in PCa cells, respectively. They were correspondingly increased and decreased in PCa cells under hypoxic conditions.

Here, we aimed to evaluate the causal effect of circulating vitamin E on the risk of ten common cancers, including bladder, breast, colorectal, esophagus, lung, oral and pharynx, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and kidney cancer.  Methods:   A Mendelian randomization (MR) analytic framework was applied to data from a cancer-specific genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising a total of 297,699 cancer cases and 304,736 controls of European ancestry. Three genetic instrumental variables associated with circulating vitamin E were selected. Summary statistic-based methods of inverse variance weighting (IVW) and likelihood-based approach, as well as the individual genotyping-based method of genetic risk score (GRS) were used. Multivariable IVW analysis was further performed to control for potential confounding effects. Furthermore, the UK Biobank cohort was used as external validation, supporting 355,543 European participants (incident cases ranged from 437 for ovarian cancer to 4882 for prostate cancer) for GRS-based estimation of circulating vitamin E, accompanied by a one-sample MR analysis of dietary vitamin E intake underlying the time-to-event analytic framework.  Results:   Specific to cancer GWAS, we found that circulating vitamin E was significantly associated with increased bladder cancer risk (odds ratios [OR]IVW = 6.23, PIVW = 3.05×10-3) but decreased breast cancer risk (ORIVW = 0.68, PIVW = 8.19×10-3); however, the significance of breast cancer was dampened (Pmultivariable IVW > 0.05) in the subsequent multivariable MR analysis. In the validation stage of the UK Biobank cohort, we did not replicate convincing causal effects of genetically predicted circulating vitamin E concentrations and dietary vitamin E intake on the risk of ten cancers.  Conclusions:   This large-scale population study upon data from cancer-specific GWAS and a longitudinal biobank cohort indicates plausible non-causal associations between circulating vitamin E and ten common cancers in the European populations. Further studies regarding ancestral diversity are warranted to validate such causal associations.""","""['Junyi Xin#', 'Xia Jiang#', 'Shuai Ben#', 'Qianyu Yuan', 'Li Su', 'Zhengdong Zhang', 'David C Christiani', 'Mulong Du', 'Meilin Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""['Correction: Association between circulating vitamin E and ten common cancers: evidence from large-scale Mendelian randomization analysis and a longitudinal cohort study.', 'Circulating vitamin C concentration and risk of cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Assessing the causal role of epigenetic clocks in the development of multiple cancers: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Circulating phosphorus concentration and risk of prostate cancer: a Mendelian randomization study.', 'Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D and Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review of Mendelian Randomization Studies.', 'Phenome-wide Mendelian randomization study evaluating the association of circulating vitamin D with complex diseases.', 'Genome-Scale Metabolic Reconstruction, Non-Targeted LC-QTOF-MS Based Metabolomics Data, and Evaluation of Anticancer Activity of Cannabis sativa Leaf Extracts.', 'Role of endogenous and exogenous antioxidants in risk of six cancers: evidence from the Mendelian randomization study.', 'Drug-induced oxidative stress in cancer treatments: Angel or devil?', 'Effect of the combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus (probiotic) with vitamin K3 and vitamin E on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus: An in\xa0vitro pathogen model.', 'Antioxidant and Anti-Tumor Effects of Dietary Vitamins A, C, and E.']"""

Results from a single institution series""","""Background:   Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for clinically significant PCa (csPCa). However, the accuracy of this test in men that received a previous prostatic surgery is still controversial. We aimed at assessing the effect of previous prostatic surgery on the detection of csPCa in a tertiary referral center.  Method:   We relied on a cohort of 311 men with a positive mpMRI (prostate imaging - reporting and data system [PI-RADS] ≥ 3) who underwent a targeted (TBx) plus concomitant systematic random biopsy (SBx) at a single tertiary referral center between 2017 and 2020. The study outcome was to compare the detection of csPCa (Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4) between the two groups (no previous prostate surgery [Group 1] vs. previous prostate surgery [Group 2]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis (MVA) was used to assess the relationship between previous prostate surgery and the detection of csPCa at TBx, after taking into account potential clinical confounders.  Results:   Overall, 24 (8%) patients received a previous prostate surgery before undergoing mpMRI. Median prostate-specific antigen density was 0.15 versus 0.08 ng/ml/cc, in Group 1 versus 2, respectively. The most frequent finding at mpMRI was in Group 1 versus 2, PI-RADS 4 (55%) versus PI-RADS 3 and 4 (42% each). The majority of patients were biopsy naïve in both Groups 1 (66%) and 2 (71%). The overall detection of csPCa in Group 1 versus 2 was 83% versus 75%, respectively. Differently, the detection of csPCa at TBx in Groups 1 versus 2 was 76% versus 71%, respectively. At MVA, previous prostate surgery (odds ratio: 0.65; p = 0.02) was significantly associated with lower csPCa detection at TBx, after accounting for potential confounders.  Conclusion:   The presence of previous prostate surgery significantly decreases the accuracy of mpMRI in detecting csPCa. These results should be taken into account when assessing patients with a history of prostatic surgery and a suspicious lesion at mpMRI, to better select those who might avoid an unnecessary biopsy.""","""['Francesco Pellegrino', 'Armando Stabile', 'Elio Mazzone', 'Gabriele Sorce', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Mario De Angelis', 'Giorgio Brembilla', 'Giorgio Gandaglia', 'Francesco De Cobelli', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Assessing the Clinical Value of Positive Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Young Men with a Suspicion of Prostate Cancer.', 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) in the Detection, Evaluation, and Surveillance of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer (csPCa).', 'The Impact of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging on Treatment Strategies for Incidental Prostate Cancer after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate.', 'Impact of prostate MRI central review over the diagnostic performance of MRI-targeted biopsy: should we routinely ask for an expert second opinion?']"""

Results:   Two hundred forty-three participants (N = 206 survivors, N = 10 oncology specialists, N = 27 PCPs) completed the study survey. Most PCPs (90%) and oncology specialists (84%) perceived that an opportunity for prostate cancer survivors to have an expanded role in their care would be beneficial. Nearly half (49%) of survivors reported that it would be beneficial to have an expanded role in their survivorship care with only 11% indicating that it would not be beneficial at all.

Results:   Data elements on demographics, diagnosis and staging, disease state at the time of procuring a genomically characterized sample, and clinical outcomes were piloted and then abstracted for 2261 patients (with 2631 samples). Completeness of data elements was generally high. Comparing to the repeat annotation by a medical oncologist blinded to the database (100 patients/samples), reproducibility of annotations was high; T stage, metastasis date, and presence and date of castration resistance had lower reproducibility.

However, controversy still exists on its added value. Based on a recent large-sample retrospective cluster study from the Netherlands showing significantly improved long-term urinary functioning after RARP compared to Laparoscopic RP (LRP), we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of RARP compared to LRP. A decision tree was constructed to measure the costs and effects from a Dutch societal perspective over a ~ 7 year time-horizon. The input was based on the aforementioned study, including patient-reported consumption of addition care and consumed care for ergonomic issues reported by surgeons. Intervention costs were calculated using a bottom-up costing analysis in 5 hospitals. Finally, a probabilistic-, one-way sensitivity- and scenario analyses were performed to show possible decision uncertainty. The intervention costs were €9964 for RARP and €7253 for LRP. Total trajectory costs were €12,078 for RARP and €10,049 for LRP. RARP showed higher QALYs compared to LRP (6.17 vs 6.11). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was €34,206 per QALY gained, in favour of RARP. As a best-case scenario, when RARP is being centralized (> 150 cases/year), total trajectory costs decreased to €10,377 having a higher utilization, and a shorter procedure time and length of stay resulting in an ICUR of €3495 per QALY gained. RARP showed to be cost-effective compared to LRP based on data from a population-based, large scale study with 7 years of follow-up.

Despite initial treatment response, castration-resistant prostate cancer nearly always develops and remains driven primarily by the androgen axis. Here we investigated how changes in oxygenation affect androgen synthesis. In prostate cancer cells, chronic hypoxia coupled to reoxygenation resulted in efficient metabolism of androgen precursors to produce androgens and activate AR. Hypoxia induced 3βHSD1, the rate-limiting androgen synthesis regulator, and reoxygenation replenished necessary cofactors, suggesting that hypoxia and reoxygenation both facilitate potent androgen synthesis. The EGLN1/VHL/HIF2α pathway induced 3βHSD1 expression through direct binding of HIF2α to the 5' regulatory region of HSD3B1 to promote transcription. Overexpression of HIF2α facilitated prostate cancer progression, which largely depended on 3βHSD1. Inhibition of HIF2α with the small-molecule PT2399 prevented prostate cancer cell proliferation. These results thus identify HIF2α as a regulator of androgen synthesis and potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer.  Significance:   Hypoxia followed by reoxygenation in prostate cancer drives androgen deprivation therapy resistance via increasing the rate-limiting enzyme and cofactors for androgen synthesis, revealing HIF2α as a therapeutic target to subvert resistance.""","""['Liang Qin', 'Yoon-Mi Chung', 'Michael Berk', 'Bryan Naelitz', 'Ziqi Zhu', 'Eric Klein', 'Abhishek A Chakraborty', 'Nima Sharifi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Uro-Science.', 'AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer Regulates a Feed-Forward Mechanism of Androgen Synthesis by Way of HSD3B1 Upregulation.', 'BMX controls 3βHSD1 and sex steroid biosynthesis in cancer.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblast-secreted glucosamine alters the androgen biosynthesis program in prostate cancer via HSD3B1 upregulation.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The role of adrenal derived androgens in castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   This population-based retrospective study used Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data from 2003-2016 to identify men receiving prostatectomy for prostate cancer. We characterized the proportion of men receiving preoperative MRI in each year and in each hospital referral region (HRR).

Results:   A total of 19,369 men received prostatectomy in 72 HRRs; the mean age was 70.2 years (SD 3.2). The proportion of men receiving a preoperative MRI increased from 2.9% to 28.2% over the study period and ranged from 0.0% to 28.8% in the different HRRs.

This examination is performed for the risk of finding an incidental prostate cancer (iPCa). The improvement of prostate cancer detection in the past few years decreased the global iPCa rate. This raises the question of the real benefit for all patients of a systematic histological analysis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the iPCa detection rate on a large contemporary cohort of patients treated for BPH, and to define predictive factors of iPCa detection.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of all consecutive patients who underwent surgical treatment for BPH in our academic center from 2012 to 2018. Patients with prostate cancer diagnosed before surgery were not included. All the resected tissue underwent standard histopathological examination. iPCa was defined by any grade or stage of prostate cancer identified on the resected tissue by the histological examination. The following variables were analyzed using an uni- and multi-variable logistic regression as potential risk factors of iPCa: age, total PSA, PSA density (PSAd), prostate volume, technique used, weight of resected tissue and use of 5ARI medication.  Results:   1045 patients were included in the study. Of them, 439 (42.0%), 206 (19.7%) and 400 (38.3%) underwent HoLEP, OP and TURP, respectively. iPCa was diagnosed in 94 (9.0%) of the 1045. Among them 15 (1.4%) were clinically significant (ISUP score ≥ 2). The multivariable logistic regression analysis identified age (p = 0.03) and PSA density (p < 0.001) as independent predictive factors for the detection of iPCa. Using the median of age and PSAd, we identified a population with 0% of iPCa in our cohort (age < 70 year-old and PSAd < 0.05 ng/mL/mL).  Conclusion:   The global iPCa rate was 9% in this contemporary large cohort of patients who underwent surgical treatment for BPH, with 1.4% of clinically significant cancer. Age and PSAd were independent predictive factors to find iPCa. Patients younger than 70 with a PSAd < 0.05 ng/mL/mL had 0% of iPCA in our cohort. In this specific population, we could probably avoid a systematical histological examination of the resected tissue.""","""['R Coman', 'J Anract', 'U Pinar', 'M Sibony', 'M Peyromaure', 'Barry Delongchamps']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['""Finding the needle in a haystack"": oncologic evaluation of patients treated for LUTS with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).', 'HoLEP provides a higher prostate cancer detection rate compared to bipolar TURP: a matched-pair analysis.', '""In-bore"" MRI prostate biopsy is a safe preoperative clinical tool to exclude significant prostate cancer in symptomatic patients with benign prostatic obstruction before transurethral laser enucleation.', 'Incidental prostate cancer after holmium laser enucleation of the prostate-A narrative review.', 'Prevalence and risk factors of incidental prostate cancer in certain surgeries for benign prostatic hyperplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The objective of the study was to comprehensively explore the relationship between social support, self-efficacy, and anxiety and depression.  Method:   A cross-sectional design and a convenience sampling method were used to recruit patients with prostate cancer from a comprehensive hospital in Zhejiang Province. Structured scales were used for data collection, including the Social Support Rating Scale, Strategies Used by People to Promote Health, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale.  Results:   The result showed that anxiety and depression were negatively correlated with self-efficacy (r = - 0. 434, P < 0. 01) and social support (r = - 0. 212, P < 0. 01), while self-efficacy and social support were positively correlated (r = 0. 356, P < 0. 01). A structural equation model showed that the effect value of social support on self-efficacy was (β = 0.386, p < 0.01) and the effect value of self-efficacy on negative emotions was (β = - 0.497, p < 0.01). Self-efficacy fully mediated the effect between social support and negative emotions with a 100% mediation rate.  Conclusion:   Social support and self-efficacy did contribute to the improvement of depression and anxiety in patients with radical prostatectomy, and they were associated with a full mediating effect of self-efficacy. Providing social support that matches the coping needs of the stressor can maximize the role of social support. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the patient's stressor and coping needs in advance, which will help us to provide matching social support, so as to alleviate patients' bad emotions more effectively and improve their prognosis.""","""['Lijuan Wang', 'Jie Luo', 'Yaqin Li', 'Yao Zhou', 'Wei Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Perceived social support, coping strategies, anxiety and depression among women with breast cancer: Evaluation of a mediation model.', 'Social support, self-efficacy, cognitive coping and psychological distress in infertile women.', 'Path analysis of the effects of social support, self-efficacy, and coping style on psychological stress in children with malignant tumor during treatment.', ""Exploring prostate cancer survivors' self-management behaviours and examining the mechanism effect that links coping and social support to health-related quality of life, anxiety and depression: a prospective longitudinal study."", 'Association between social support, functional status, and change in health-related quality of life and changes in anxiety and depression in colorectal cancer patients.', 'HIV/AIDS Knowledge, Depression, and HIV-Related Stigma Among Elderly Men in Rural China: A Hierarchical Regression Analysis.', 'Socioeconomic factors, perceived stress, and social support effect on neonatal nurse burnout in China: a cross-sectional study.', 'COVID-19 pandemic-related depression and anxiety under lockdown: The chain mediating effect of self-efficacy and perceived stress.', 'The Relationship between Physical Activity and Mental Depression in Older Adults during the Prevention and Control of COVID-19: A Mixed Model with Mediating and Moderating Effects.']"""

Because of the lack of a standardized MRI approach after whole-gland treatment, a panel of international experts recently proposed the Prostate Imaging for Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR) assessment score. Purpose To determine the diagnostic accuracy of PI-RR for detecting local recurrence in patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radiation therapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) and to evaluate the interreader variability of PI-RR scoring. Materials and Methods This retrospective observational study included patients who underwent multiparametric MRI between September 2016 and May 2021 for BCR after RT or RP. MRI scans were analyzed, and a PI-RR score was assigned independently by four radiologists. The reference standard was defined using histopathologic findings, follow-up imaging, or clinical response to treatment. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy were calculated to assess PI-RR performance for each reader. The intraclass correlation coefficient was used to determine interreader agreement. Results A total of 100 men were included: 48 patients after RT (median age, 76 years [IQR, 70-82 years]) and 52 patients after RP (median age, 70 years [IQR, 66-74 years]). After RT, with PI-RR of 3 or greater as a cutoff (assigned when recurrence is uncertain), diagnostic performance ranges were 71%-81% sensitivity, 74%-93% specificity, 71%-89% PPV, 79%-86% NPV, and 77%-88% accuracy across the four readers. After RP, with PI-RR of 3 or greater as a cutoff, performance ranges were 59%-83% sensitivity, 87%-100% specificity, 88%-100% PPV, 66%-80% NPV, and 75%-85% accuracy. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.87 across the four readers for both the RT and RP groups.

The Jumonji C-containing histone lysine demethylase family 4 (KDM4) members, KDM4A‒KDM4C, serve as critical coactivators of AR to promote tumor growth in prostate cancer and are candidate therapeutic targets to overcome AR mutations/alterations-mediated resistance in CRPC.  Methods:   In this study, using a structure-based approach, we identified a natural product, myricetin, able to block the demethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 trimethylation by KDM4 members and evaluated its effects on CRPC. A structure-based screening was employed to search for a natural product that inhibited KDM4B. Inhibition kinetics of myricetin was determined. The cytotoxic effect of myricetin on various prostate cancer cells was evaluated. The combined effect of myricetin with enzalutamide, a second-generation AR inhibitor toward C4-2B, a CRPC cell line, was assessed. To improve bioavailability, myricetin encapsulated by poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), the US food and drug administration (FDA)-approved material as drug carriers, was synthesized and its antitumor activity alone or with enzalutamide was evaluated using in vivo C4-2B xenografts.  Results:   Myricetin was identified as a potent α-ketoglutarate-type inhibitor that blocks the demethylation activity by KDM4s and significantly reduced the proliferation of both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent CRPC (CWR22Rv1 and C4-2B). A synergistic cytotoxic effect toward C4-2B was detected for the combination of myricetin and enzalutamide. PLGA-myricetin, enzalutamide, and the combined treatment showed significantly greater antitumor activity than that of the control group in the C4-2B xenograft model. Tumor growth was significantly lower for the combination treatment than for enzalutamide or myricetin treatment alone.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that myricetin is a pan-KDM4 inhibitor and exhibited potent cell cytotoxicity toward CRPC cells.

Materials and methods:   Patients booked for clinical prostate MRI were randomly assigned to SRR or SRR + PACERR. Questionnaires included multiple-choice that targeted 4 domains (understanding, usefulness, next steps, emotional experience) hypothesized to improve with patient-centred reports and short answer questions, testing knowledge regarding MRI results. Clinical encounters were observed and recorded to explore whether adding PACERR improved communication.

Patients receiving a PACERR had higher scores in the categories of patient understanding (mean: 4.17 vs. 3.39, p=0.006), usefulness (mean: 4.58 vs. 3.07, p<0.001), and identifying next steps (mean: 1.89 vs. 3.03, p=0.003) but not emotional experience (mean: 4.18 vs. 3.79, p=0.22). PACERR participants found the layout and design more patient friendly (mean: 4.47 vs. 2.61, p<0.001) and easier to understand (mean: 4.37 vs. 2.38, p<0.001). In the knowledge section, overall, the PACERR arm scored better (87% vs. 56%, p=0.004).

Methods:   Patient consultations with nurse practitioners and urologists discussing personalized risks of urinary incontinence after prostatectomy were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded. Patients (n = 27) were then interviewed to explore their perceptions and use of personalized side-effect risks.  Results:   HPs explained personalized risks by discussing risk factors, which was appreciated and recalled by patients. Personalized risks were typically communicated both numerically and verbally (70%). When using numbers, HPs always used percentages, but rarely used natural frequencies (14%). Uncertainty was disclosed in only 34% of consultations. One-third of patients used personalized risks in their treatment decision-making by either switching to another treatment or sticking to their initial preference.  Conclusions:   Patients value and use personalized side-effect risks during treatment decision-making. Clearly explaining the relationship between risk factors and personalized risk estimates may help patients understand and recall those.

Serum pepsinogen is a biomarker for atrophic gastritis, a gastric cancer precursor, and may be useful to detect persons at increased risk of gastric cancer.  Methods:   The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was conducted in the United States between 1993 and 2001. ELISA-based pepsinogen tests were conducted on prediagnostic serum samples of 105 PLCO participants who developed gastric cancer and 209 age, sex, and race-matched controls. Pepsinogen positive (PG+) was defined as pepsinogen I ≤ 70 μg/L and pepsinogen I/II ratio ≤3.0. Results of conditional logistic regression models, and sensitivity and specificity, of PG+ for gastric cancer are reported.  Results:   Gastric cancer cases were more likely to be PG+ (31.4% vs. 5.5%, P < 0.001) at baseline than controls. Compared to PG-, PG+ was associated with an 8.5-fold increased risk for gastric cancer [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.8-19.4]. This risk remained significant after adjusting for Helicobacter pylori, family history of gastric cancer, education, smoking, and BMI (aOR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3-26.2). In subgroup analysis, PG+ individuals were 11-fold more like to develop non-cardia gastric cancer (OR, 11.1; 95% CI, 4.3-28.8); conversely, they were not significantly more likely to develop cardia gastric cancer (OR, 2.0; 95% CI = 0.3-14.2). PG+ status yielded low sensitivity but high specificity for both noncardia (44.3%; 93.6%) and cardia gastric cancer (5.7%; 97.2%).  Conclusions:   Prediagnostic serum pepsinogen levels from a large, prospective cohort study were associated with risk of gastric cancer, particularly noncardia gastric cancer.  Impact:   PG status may identify individuals at higher risk of noncardia gastric cancer for targeted screening or interventions.

Materials and methods:   We used cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) and clone formation experiments to study the effect of ATO on the proliferation of PC3 cells. Flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining were used to detect cell apoptosis. Cell migration and invasion were detected through wound healing experiments and transwell experiments. Western blotting was applied to detect apoptosis-related proteins (BAX, Bcl-2, PARP, and Caspase-3), epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) proteins, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression. A mouse xenograft tumor model was established, and tumor volume and weight were determined. The expression levels of the above-mentioned proteins were determined through western blot.  Results:   ATO inhibited PC-3 cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. ATO significantly up-regulated the expression of BAX, PARP, and Caspase-3 and inhibited the expression of Bcl-2. Wound healing and transwell experiments showed that ATO inhibited invasion and metastasis in PC-3 cells, possibly because ATO could inhibit the EMT and the expression of MMPs in PC-3 cells.

Delivery of combined anticancer agents loaded in a nanocarrier would be a promising option for combination therapy. Here, we designed PEGylated nano-liposomes for co-delivery Docetaxel (Doc) and Resveratrol (Res) to evaluate antitumor efficiency of the combined drugs in prostate cancer. The average diameter of the liposomes was 99.67 nm with a spheral-like shape. Drug release studies showed that both drugs could synchronously leak from the liposomes in a sustained release behavior. Cellular uptake results demonstrated that liposomes could effectively deliver more cargos into cells than other formulations. Moreover, co-loaded liposomes with Doc/Res in a molar ratio of 1:2 exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity than a mixed solution containing both drugs on cancer cells. In the study of caspase 3, we found that the combination of Doc and Res could significantly increase the activity of caspase 3 enzyme compared with Doc alone. Animal studies revealed that co-encapsulated Doc/Res in liposomes predominantly inhibited tumor growth in PC3 bearing Balb/c nude mice, as evidenced by a change in cell proliferation and apoptosis parameters. Importantly, little toxicities and prolonged survival time were observed in mice treated with liposome-loaded Doc/Res than control group exposed to liposome-free Doc/Res.

The aim of this study was to analyze mortality by cause, prevalence of some non-cancer diseases, and incidence of the main cancers among greenspace workers.  Methods:   A sub-cohort of greenspace workers was formed within the AGRICAN cohort. Demographic information, health characteristics and self-reported diseases at enrollment were described separately in terms of frequencies (%), median and Interquartile Range (IQR) for greenspace workers, farmers, and other non-agricultural workers. Causes of death and cancer incidence were identified through linkage with cancer registries from enrollment (2005-2007) to 2015. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% Confidence Intervals [95% CI] were estimated using Cox proportional hazard regression with age as the underlying timescale.  Results:   The sub-cohort included 6247 greenspace workers who were higher proportion men, younger and more frequently smokers than farmers and non-agricultural workers. Male and female greenspace workers reported more history of allergic diseases; and males, more history of depression. Compared to other workers male greenspace workers showed a non-significant higher mortality from ischemic cardiological diseases (HR = 1.14 [0.81-1.60]). Incidence was higher in male greenspace workers than farmers for overall cancer (HR = 1.15 [1.04-1.27]), cancer of the prostate (HR = 1.21 [1.02-1.44]), thyroid (HR = 2.84 [1.26-6.41]), testis (HR = 3.98 [1.50-10.58]) and skin melanoma (HR = 2.15 [1.33-3.47]). Non-significant increased risks were also found for sarcomas, larynx and breast. In women, risk of breast cancer was higher in greenspace workers than in farmers (HR = 1.71 [1.17-2.50]).

Lycopene, a safe and effective phytochemical, has been documented to have anticancer activity in a variety of tumors, especially for prostate cancer (PCa). The aim of this study was to provide data support for the combination of lycopene and enzalutamide in the treatment of CRPC. To this end, tissues from patients with primary prostate cancer (PPC) and CRPC were examined by immunohistochemical analysis and found that p-AKT and p-EZH2 were overexpressed in CRPC. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the high expression of p-AKT and p-EZH2 may be related to the poor prognosis of patients. In addition, the expression of p-AKT, p-EZH2 and androgen receptor (AR) were significantly down-regulated in 22RV1 and C4-2B cells and the proliferation and invasion of CRPC cells were inhibited after treatment with lycopene, while SC79 (an AKT agonist) markedly rescue this effect. Of note, a combination of lycopene and enzalutamide significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion of CRPC cells in vitro, as well as tumor growth and bone metastasis in vivo. These results suggest that the enhanced antitumor effects of enzalutamide by lycopene may be related to the reduction of AR protein levels through lycopene-mediated inhibition of AKT/EZH2 pathway, which may provide a new approach to improve the efficacy of enzalutamide in CRPC.""","""['Xiong Chen', 'Guo Yang', 'Miao Liu', 'Zhen Quan', 'Leilei Wang', 'Chunli Luo', 'Xiaohou Wu', 'Yongbo Zheng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Inhibition of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Drug Resistance of Enzalutamide in CRPC.', 'Overview of the Potential Beneficial Effects of Carotenoids on Consumer Health and Well-Being.', 'Research Trend and Detailed Insights into the Molecular Mechanisms of Food Bioactive Compounds against Cancer: A Comprehensive Review with Special Emphasis on Probiotics.', 'Targeting PI3K/Akt signaling in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

A scoring strategy, which is learned to judge the segmentation quality of DIL, is integrated into cascaded convolutional neural network to solve the challenge of segmenting the irregular shapes of the DIL. To evaluate the proposed method, 77 patients who underwent MRI and PET/CT were retrospectively investigated. The prostate and DIL ground truth contours were delineated by experienced radiologists. The proposed method was evaluated with fivefold cross-validation and holdout testing.  Results:   The average centroid distance, volume difference, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) value for prostate/DIL are 4.3 ± 7.5/3.73 ± 3.78 mm, 4.5 ± 7.9/0.41 ± 0.59 cc, and 89.6 ± 8.9/84.3 ± 11.9%, respectively. Comparable results were obtained in the holdout test. Similar or superior segmentation outcomes were seen when compared the results of the proposed method to those of competing segmentation approaches.  Conclusions:   The proposed automatic segmentation method can accurately and simultaneously segment both the prostate and DILs. The intended future use for this algorithm is focal boost prostate radiation therapy.""","""['Zachary A Eidex', 'Tonghe Wang', 'Yang Lei', 'Marian Axente', 'Oladunni O Akin-Akintayo', 'Olayinka A Abiodun Ojo', 'Akinyemi A Akintayo', 'Justin Roper', 'Jeffery D Bradley', 'Tian Liu', 'David M Schuster', 'Xiaofeng Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Prostate and dominant intraprostatic lesion segmentation on PET/CT using cascaded regional-net.', 'Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', 'Deformable MR-CBCT prostate registration using biomechanically constrained deep learning networks.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'Deep Learning in MRI-guided Radiation Therapy: A Systematic Review.']"""

Hormones are involved in signal transduction which orchestrate processes, such as apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle or cytoskeleton organization. Currently, there is a need for novel biomarkers which would help to diagnose cancers efficiently. In this study, the genes implicated in signaling that is important in hormone-sensitive carcinogenesis were investigated regarding their prognostic significance. Data of seven cancer cohorts were collected from FireBrowse. 54 gene sets implicated in specific pathways were browsed through MSig database. Profiling was assessed via Monocle3, while gene ontology through PANTHER. For confirmation, correlation analysis was performed using WGCNA. Protein-protein networks were visualized via Cytoscape and impact of genes on survival, as well as cell cycle or cytoskeleton-related prognostic signatures, was tested. Several differences in expression profile were identified, some of them allowed to distinguish histology. Functional annotation revealed that various regulation of cell cycle, adhesion, migration, apoptosis and angiogenesis underlie these differences. Clinical traits, such as histological type or cancer staging, were found during evaluation of module-trait relationships. Of modules, the TopHubs (COL6A3, TNR, GTF2A1, NKX3-1) interacted directly with, e.g., PDGFB, ITGA10, SP1 or AKT3. Among TopHubs and interacting proteins, many showed an impact on hazard ratio and affected the cell cycle or cytoskeleton-related prognostic signatures, e.g., COL1A1 or PDGFB. In conclusion, this study laid the foundation for further hormone-sensitive carcinogenesis research through identification of genes which prove that crosstalk between cell cycle and cytoskeleton exists, opening avenues for future therapeutic strategies.""","""['Klaudia Waszczykowska#', 'Karolina Prażanowska#', 'Żaneta Kałuzińska#', 'Damian Kołat#', 'Elżbieta Płuciennik']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Genet Genomics""","""['Functional genomics of AP-2α and AP-2γ in cancers: in silico study.', 'Identification of Key Modules and Hub Genes Involved in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma Tumorigenesis Using WCGNA.', 'Bioinformatics analyses of significant genes, related pathways and candidate prognostic biomarkers in glioblastoma.', 'The outstanding role of miR-132-3p in carcinogenesis of solid tumors.', 'Cell Architecture-Dependent Constraints: Critical Safeguards to Carcinogenesis.']"""

Ninety-two post-ADT prostate cancer patients underwent MRI before prostatectomy (62 with significant residual disease and 30 with complete response or minimum residual disease [CR/MRD]). Totally, 100 significant residual, 52 CR/MRD lesions, and 70 benign tissues were selected according to pathology. First, 381 radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. Optimal features were selected using a support vector machine with a recursive feature elimination algorithm (SVM-RFE). Then, ADC values of significant residual, CR/MRD lesions, and benign tissues were compared by one-way analysis of variance. Logistic regression was used to construct models with SVM features to differentiate between each pair of tissues. Third, the efficiencies of ADC value and radiomics models for differentiating the three tissues were assessed by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The ADC value (mean ± standard deviation [s.d.]) of significant residual lesions ([1.10 ± 0.02] × 10-3 mm2 s-1) was significantly lower than that of CR/MRD ([1.17 ± 0.02] × 10-3 mm2 s-1), which was significantly lower than that of benign tissues ([1.30 ± 0.02] × 10-3 mm2 s-1; both P < 0.05).

From a prostate biopsy database between March 2017 and July 2021, we retrospectively identified 240 biopsy-naïve patients with negative prebiopsy mpMRI (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 [PI-RADS v2] score <3). Logistic regression analysis was performed to select the potential predictors for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were performed to assess the diagnostic accuracy. The negative predictive values of mpMRI in excluding any cancer and csPCa were 83.8% (201/240) and 90.8% (218/240), respectively. ROC curve analysis indicated that PSAD was the most promising predictor, with an AUC value of 0.786 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.699-0.874), and multiparametric logistic regression analysis confirmed that higher PSAD remained a significant marker for predicting csPCa (odds ratio [OR]: 10.99, 95% CI: 2.75-44.02, P < 0.001).

The effect of different concentrations of isoflurane (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) on PC cell proliferation (PC3 and 22RV1) was measured. After PC cells and normal human prostate stromal immortalized WPMY-1 cells were treated with isoflurane, BACH1 and miR-375 expression was measured. Subsequently, PC3 and 22RV1 cells underwent gain- and loss-of-function assays with or without 4-h 2% isoflurane pretreatment. The levels of miR-375, BACH1, and PTEN were assessed. The binding of BACH1 to miR-375 promoter was detected by ChIP assay. Dual-luciferase reporter assay detected the targeting relationship of miR-375 with BACH1 and PTEN. Isoflurane promoted PC3 and 22RV1 cell proliferation. In addition, isoflurane elevated the levels of BACH1 and miR-375 in a dosage-dependent manner in PC cells. Transfection with miR-375 inhibitor or sh-BACH1 repressed PC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, while exposure to 2% isoflurane for 4 h before transfection counteracted the inhibitory effects of sh-BACH1 or miR-375 inhibitor on PC cells. PTEN expression was suppressed after 2% isoflurane treatment, but the transfection with miR-375 inhibitor partly abrogated this suppressive effect in PC cells. Moreover, BACH1 bound to miR-375 and miR-375 negatively targeted PTEN. miR-375 mimic could partially reverse the inhibitory effects of sh-BACH1 on the proliferation, invasion, and migration of isoflurane-treated PC cells.

Most published studies focus on a single miRNA when characterizing the role of small RNAs in cancer. However, ~30% of human miRNA genes are organized in clustered units that are often co-expressed, indicating a complex and coordinated system of noncoding RNA regulation. A clearer understating of how clustered miRNA networks function cooperatively to regulate tumor growth, cancer aggressiveness, and drug resistance is required before translating noncoding small RNAs to the clinic. The use of a high-throughput clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing procedure has been employed to study the oncogenic role of a genomic cluster of seven miRNA genes located within a locus spanning ~35,000 bp in length in the context of prostate cancer. For this approach, human cancer cell lines were infected with a lentivirus vector for doxycycline (DOX)-inducible Cas9 nuclease grown in DOX-containing medium for 48 h. The cells were subsequently co-transfected with synthetic trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) complexed with genomic site-specific CRISPR RNA (crRNA) oligonucleotides to allow the rapid generation of cancer cell lines carrying the entire miRNA cluster deletion and individual or combination miRNA gene cluster deletions within a single experiment. The advantages of this high-throughput gene editing system are the ability to avoid time-consuming DNA vector subcloning, the flexibility in transfecting cells with unique guide RNA combinations in a 24-well format, and the lower-cost PCR genotyping using crude cell lysates. Studies using this streamlined approach promise to uncover functional redundancies and synergistic/antagonistic interactions between miRNA cluster members, which will aid in characterizing the complex small noncoding RNA networks involved in human disease and better inform future therapeutic design.""","""['Charlotte Chambers', 'Linh Quan', 'Grace Yi', 'Aurora Esquela-Kerscher']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Vis Exp""","""['Interrogation of Functional miRNA-Target Interactions by CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Engineering.', 'CRISPR/Cas9-mediated noncoding RNA editing in human cancers.', 'Simplified CRISPR tools for efficient genome editing and streamlined protocols for their delivery into mammalian cells and mouse zygotes.', 'High-Throughput Approaches to Pinpoint Function within the Noncoding Genome.', ""Design and Evaluation of Guide RNA Transcripts with a 3'-Terminal HDV Ribozyme to Enhance CRISPR-Based Gene Inactivation.""]"""

Methods:   The effective ingredients of YJD and targets of PCOS were selected from public databases. The network pharmacology method was used to analyze the ingredients, potential targets, and pathways of YJD for the treatment of PCOS.  Results:   One hundred and three active ingredients were identified from YJD, of which 82 were hit by 65 targets associated with PCOS. By constructing the disease-common targetcompound network, five ingredients (quercetin, arachidonate, beta-sitosterol, betacarotene, and cholesterol) were selected out as the key ingredients of YJD, which can interact with the 10 hub genes (VEGFA, AKT1, TP53, ALB, TNF, PIK3CA, IGF1, INS, IL1B, PTEN) against PCOS. These genes are mainly involved in prostate cancer, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance pathways.

E2F transcription factors (E2Fs) have been reported to be involved in the growth of various cancers. Accumulating studies indicate that prostate cancer (PCa) carcinogenesis is attributed to aberrant E2F expression or E2F alteration. However, the expression patterns and prognostic value of the eight E2Fs in prostate cancer have yet to be explored. In this study, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Kaplan-Meier Plotter, Metascape, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), CIBERSORT, and cBioPortal and bioinformatic analysis were used to investigate E2Fs in patients with PCa. Our results showed that the expression of E2F1-3, E2F5, and E2F6 was higher in prostate cancer tissues than in benign tissues. Furthermore, elevated E2F1-3 and E2F5 expression levels were associated with a higher Gleason score (GS), advanced tumor stage, and metastasis. Survival analysis suggested that high transcription levels of E2F1-3, E2F5, E2F6, and E2F8 were associated with a higher risk of biochemical recurrence. In addition, we developed a prognostic model combining E2F1, E2F6, Gleason score, and the clinical stage that may accurately predict a biochemical recurrence-free survival. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the E2F family members and their neighboring genes were mainly enriched in cell cycle-related pathways. Somatic mutations in different subgroups were also investigated, and immune components were predicted.

Using in vitro and in vivo models, as well as ex vivo culture of patient prostate tissue, we evaluated the influence of androgen, estrogen, and progesterone on immune cells of the prostate microenvironment.  Results: In vitro, we observed sex steroids induced indirect changes on prostate cancer cell proliferation via THP-1 derived macrophages, but no clear changes were induced using human monocyte derived macrophages. Comparing immunohistochemistry for immunosuppressive macrophage marker CD163 with concomitant circulating sex steroids from the same patients, we observed a correlation with higher dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)-sulfate and estrone-sulfate levels associated with higher prostate CD163 expression. Similar relationships between DHEA and CD163 levels were observed in ex vivo cultured prostate biopsies. Finally, in a murine prostate cancer model of long-term sex steroids we observed significant differences in tumor growth in mice implanted with estrogen and DHEA diffusion tubes.

Methods:   The clinical data of 98 patients with early-to-mid prostate cancer undergoing radical resection treated in our hospital (July 2014 to July 2016) were selected for the retrospective analysis, and the patients were divided into group A (n = 49, routine hormonal therapy) and group B (n = 49, routine hormonal therapy plus DHZCP) according to the double blind method, so as to compare the trauma symptoms, cancer recurrence rate, etc., after treatment between the two groups.  Results:   Compared with group A, group B obtained significantly higher total effective rate of complication treatment at different time points (P < 0.05), significantly lower mean HAMA score after treatment (P < 0.05), and significantly lower total recurrence rate (P < 0.05). The ""congestion"" theory in Chapter VI On Pulse, Symptom Complex and Treatment of Arthralgia Due to Stagnation of Blood and Consumptive Diseases of Jingui Yaolue was the theoretical basis for postoperative effect observation of DHZCP in treating prostate cancer.

Methods:   A metabolite-specific bSSFP urea imaging sequence was designed using a urea-specific excitation pulse, optimized TR, and 3D stack-of-spiral readouts. Simulations and phantom studies were performed to validate the spectral response of the sequence. The image quality of urea data acquired by the 3D-bSSFP sequence and the 2D-GRE sequence was evaluated with 2 identical injections of co-hyperpolarized [1-13 C]pyruvate and [13 C,15 N2 ]urea formula in a rat. Subsequently, the feasibility of the acquisition strategy was validated in a prostate cancer patient.  Results:   Simulations and phantom studies demonstrated that 3D-bSSFP sequence achieved urea-only excitation, while minimally perturbing other metabolites (<1%). An animal study demonstrated that compared to GRE, bSSFP sequence provided an ∼2.5-fold improvement in SNR without perturbing urea or pyruvate kinetics, and bSSFP approach with a shorter spiral readout reduced blurring artifacts caused by J-coupling of [13 C,15 N2 ]urea.

In order to facilitate the development of peptides, and proteins as new diagnostic and therapeutic agents, we have diversified the compact EWOD microfluidic platform to perform the three-step radiosynthesis of [18F]SFB starting from the no carrier added [18F]fluoride ion. In this report, we established an optimal microliter droplet reaction condition to obtain reliable yields and synthesized [18F]SFB with sufficient radioactivity for subsequent conjugation to the anti-PSCA cys-diabody (A2cDb) and for small animal imaging. The three-step, one-pot radiosynthesis of [18F]SFB radiochemistry was adapted to a batch microfluidic platform with a reaction droplet sandwiched between two parallel plates of an EWOD chip, and optimized. Specifically, the ratio of precursor to base, droplet volume, reagent concentration, reaction time, and evaporation time were found be to be critical parameters. [18F]SFB was successfully synthesized on the EWOD chip in 39 ± 7% (n = 4) radiochemical yield in a total synthesis time of ∼120 min ([18F]fluoride activation, [18F]fluorination, hydrolysis, and coupling reaction, HPLC purification, drying and reformulation). The reformulation and stabilization step for [18F]SFB was important to obtain a high protein labeling efficiency of 33.1 ± 12.5% (n = 3). A small-animal immunoPET pilot study demonstrated that the [18F]SFB-PSCA diabody conjugate showed specific uptake in the PSCA-positive human prostate cancer xenograft.

To reduce bias, weighting methods have been developed, though few studies have validated weighted survey estimates against generally accepted high-quality independent population benchmark estimates.  Methods:   We applied post-stratification and raking methods to the Australian 45 and Up Study using Census data and compared the resulting prevalence of characteristics to accepted population benchmark estimates and separately, the incidence rates of lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer to whole-of-population estimates using Standardised Incidence Ratios (SIRs).  Results:   The differences between 45 and Up Study and population benchmark estimates narrowed following sufficiently-informed raking, e.g. 13.6% unweighted prevalence of self-reported fair/poor overall health, compared to 17.0% after raking and 17.9% from a population benchmark estimate. Raking also improved generalisability of cancer incidence estimates. For example, unweighted 45 and Up Study versus whole-of-population SIRs were 0.700 (95%CI:0.574-0.848) for male lung cancer and 1.098 (95%CI:1.002-1.204) for prostate cancer, while estimated SIRs after sufficiently-informed raking were 0.828 (95%CI:0.684-0.998) and 1.019 (95%CI:0.926-1.121), respectively.

We analyzed the nationwide German hospital billing database for a PCa diagnosis in combination with FT. For analyses on the hospital level, we used the reimbursement.INFO tool based on hospitals' quality reports. The study period was 2006 to 2019.  Results:   We identified 23,677 cases of FT from 2006 to 2019. Considering all PCa cases with surgery, radiotherapy or FT, the share of FT was stable at 4%. The annual caseload of FT increased to a maximum of 2653 cases in 2008 (p < 0.001) and then decreased to 1182 cases in 2014 (p < 0.001). Since 2015, the cases of FT remained on a plateau around 1400 cases per year. The share of HIFU was stable at 92-96% from 2006 to 2017 and decreased thereafter to 75% in 2019 (p = 0.015). In 2019, VTP-TOOKAD® increased to 11.5% and TULSA to 6%. In 2006, 21% (62/299) of urological departments performed FT and 20 departments reached > 20 FT procedures. In 2019, 16% (58/368) of urological departments performed FT and 7 departments reached > 20 FT. In 2019, 25 urological departments offered FT other than HIFU: 5 centers hyperthermia ablation, 11 centers VTP TOOKAD®, 3 centers cryotherapy, 6 centers TULSA.

Analyses of clinical specimens reveal that concurrent low AR and high MYC transcriptional programs accelerate prostate cancer progression toward a metastatic, castration-resistant disease. Data integration of single-cell transcriptomics together with ChIP-seq uncover an increase in RNA polymerase II (Pol II) promoter-proximal pausing at AR-dependent genes following MYC overexpression without an accompanying deactivation of AR-bound enhancers.

The incidence of brain metastases (mets) has been reported to increase since 2004 with the use of docetaxel, but not the incidence of visceral mets. Our objective was to study whether the use of NHAs increases the risk of developing visceral or brain mets (VBMs).  Patients and methods:   mCRPC patients with mets limited to bone (bmCRPC), treated at Tours University Hospital between 2007 and 2015, were included retrospectively. The primary endpoint was to determine whether treatment with NHAs was associated with an increased incidence of VBMs. Secondary endpoints included the search for putative predictive factors to develop VBMs.  Results:   On 187 bmCRPC patients included, 65 developed VBMs. VBM incidence increased in bmCRPC patients alive after 2011, compared to patients who died before (39.7 vs. 24.6%, P = .04). Meanwhile, their median OS increased from 16.3 months to 28.5 months (P = .01). The longer was the treatment with NHAs, the lower was the risk of VBMs (HR = 0.96, 95% CI [0.94; 0.99]), whereas age < 70 years (HR = 3.33, 95% CI [1.50; 7.40]) and low PSA level at diagnosis (HR = 1.58, 95% CI [1.16; 2.15]) increased this risk.  Conclusion:   Though retrospective, our results showed an increased incidence of VBMs in bmCRPC patients after 2011. However, this was not associated with NHA exposure duration.

A total of 5463 men with PSA levels of <10 ng ml-1 and without prostate cancer diagnosis were included in this study. Patients were classified into four groups: PSA <2.5 ng ml-1, 2.5-3.9 ng ml-1, 4.0-9.9 ng ml-1, and 2.5-9.9 ng ml-1. Pearson/Spearman's correlation coefficient (r) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the ability of tPSA and fPSA to predict PV. The correlation coefficient between tPSA and PV in the PSA <2.5 ng ml-1 cohort (r = 0.422; P < 0.001) was markedly higher than those of the cohorts with PSA levels of 2.5-3.9 ng ml-1, 4.0-9.9 ng ml-1, and 2.5-9.9 ng ml-1 (r = 0.114, 0.167, and 0.264, respectively; all P ≤ 0.001), while fPSA levels did not differ significantly among different PSA groups. Area under ROC curve (AUC) analyses revealed that the performance of fPSA in predicting PV ≥40 ml (AUC: 0.694, 0.714, and 0.727) was better than that of tPSA (AUC = 0.545, 0.561, and 0.611) in men with PSA levels of 2.5-3.9 ng ml-1, 4.0-9.9 ng ml-1, and 2.5-9.9 ng ml-1, respectively, but not at PSA levels of <2.5 ng ml-1 (AUC: 0.713 vs 0.720). These findings suggest that the relationship between tPSA and PV may vary with PSA level and that fPSA is more powerful at predicting PV only in the ''gray zone'' (PSA levels of 2.5-9.9 ng ml-1), but its performance was similar to that of tPSA at PSA levels of <2.5 ng ml-1.""","""['Ma-Ping Huang', 'Ping Tang', 'Cliff S Klein', 'Xing-Hua Wei', 'Wei Du', 'Jin-Gao Fu', 'Tian-Hai Huang', 'Hui Chen', 'Ke-Ji Xie']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Relationships between total/free prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume in Chinese men with biopsy-proven benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Comparative evaluation of various prostate specific antigen ratios for the early detection of prostate cancer.', 'The ratio of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to prostate volume (PSA density) as a parameter to improve the detection of prostate carcinoma in PSA values in the range of < 4 ng/mL.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Use of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoforms for the detection of prostate cancer in men with a PSA level of 2-10 ng/ml: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Our objective was to evaluate the associations between cumulative residential greenness exposure and site-specific cancer incidence (lung, bladder, breast, prostate, and skin cancer) within a registry-based cohort study.  Methods:   This study was based on 144,427 participants who lived in the Tel Aviv district during 1995-2015. The residential greenness exposure was estimated for every participant, as the weighted mean residential greenness exposure, based on the mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in the residential area and the duration of the residence in this area. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the unadjusted and adjusted associations between exposure to greenness and cancer incidence during 1998-2015 (Hazard Ratios (HRs) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs)). Covariates included in adjusted models were selected based on prior knowledge and directed acyclic graphs. We imputed missing data and further sensitivity analyses were conducted.  Results:   After adjustments, beneficial associations between exposure to greenness and cancer incidence were observed. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in NDVI was associated with a lower HRs for lung cancer (HRadj. = 0.75 95% CI: 0.66-0.85), bladder cancer (HRadj. = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.62-0.82), breast cancer (HRadj. = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.88), prostate cancer (HRadj. = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.70-0.86) and skin cancer (HRadj. = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.69-0.88). Generally, the patterns of associations were consistent between complete-case models and imputed models, when estimated for participants aged 16 years or 40 years and older at baseline, when stratified by area level socioeconomic status, when evaluated for non-movers participants and after further adjustment to social determinants of health.

Methods:   PSQA was performed for 100 head and neck (H&N) and 73 prostate cancer VMAT treatment plans. Measurements were acquired using a cylindrical water equivalent phantom, hollow in the center, allowing measurements with homogeneous or heterogeneous inserts. The LINAC-delivered dose distributions were compared to those calculated from the treatment planning system through the gamma index. TL and AL were determined through the computation of two-dimensional (2D) %GP using the recommended acceptance criteria. Dose-volume histograms were reconstructed from the measurements using a commercially available software to detect the dosimetric errors (%DE) between the compared dose distributions. Utilizing the estimated dose on the patient anatomy, structure-specific %GP (3D %GP) were calculated. The 3D %GP were compared to the 2D %GP ones based on their correlation with the %DE. Each metric's sensitivity was determined through receiver operator characteristic analysis.  Results:   TL and AL were in concordance with the universal ones, regarding the prostate cancer cases, but were lower for the H&N cases. Evaluation of %DE did not deem the plans unacceptable. The 2D %GP and the 3D %GP did not differ significantly regarding their correlation with %DE. For prostate plans, %GP sensitivity was higher than for H&N cases.

This study compared the tracer-specific positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) characteristics of 18F-PSMA-7Q with those of 18F-DCFPyL in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.  Methods:   Ten patients received similar doses of 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-7Q 48 h apart and were imaged 1 h after injection on the same PET/CT scanner. Normal-organ biodistribution and tumor uptake were quantified using maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean), and all lesions were assigned a molecular imaging PSMA (miPSMA) score based on Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging Standardized Evaluation criteria.  Results:   Seventeen lesions were detected in the 10 patients by both 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-7Q. No statistically significant difference was observed when comparing the SUVmax and SUVmean of 18F-DCFPyL and 18F-PSMA-7Q in the lesions and parotid gland. The κ value for the miPSMA scores of the lesions between the two tracers was 0.907, indicating excellent agreement.

Methods:   We used monthly provider-level claims data spanning nearly five years between July 1 st, 2014 and May 30th, 2019 from a large community oncology practice network where roughly half of the practices participated in the OCM. The key outcome measures were monthly mean office visits, costs, and buy-and-bill drug costs among prostate, colon, breast, and lung cancers. We conducted two quasi-experimental analyses: an event study, which measures the monthly association of providing care in an OCM relative to a non-participating practice, and a difference-in-differences model, which summarizes the event study results into post-launch average estimates. We controlled for mean differences between practices, providers, and patient.  Results:   The event study analysis shows similar pre-period estimates and trends for each cancer. The difference-in-differences estimates for office visits are statistically significant for each cancer: 33 percentage point reductions in prostate cancer (95 % CI: -0.66 to 0.00; p = 0.05), 22 percentage point reductions in colon cancer (95 % CI: -0.48 to 0.04; p = 0.09), 21 percentage point reductions in breast cancer (95 % CI: -0.45 to 0.02; p = 0.08), and 24 percentage point reductions in lung cancer (95 % CI: -0.49 to 0.00; p = 0.05). Monthly prostate cancer costs also reduced by $505 (95 % CI: -$1108 to $99; p = 0.10).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that the OCM was associated with relative reductions in office visits and, for prostate cancer, in overall costs too. These associations generally decreased within the first year of launch and sustained through roughly two years.

Methods:   We used a retrospective cohort study design with 12-month baseline and follow-up periods. We identified a cohort of older adults (age ≥ 66 years) diagnosed with breast, prostate, colorectal cancers, or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma between January 2014 and December 2014. We assessed low-value care and patient out-of-pocket expenditure in the follow-up period. We identified relevant low-value services using ICD9/ICD10 and CPT/HCPCS codes from the linked health claims and patient out-of-pocket expenditure from Medicare claim files and expressed expenditure in 2016 USD.  Results:   About 29 % of older adults received at least one low-value care procedure during the follow-up period. Low-value care differed by gender, and rates were higher in women with colorectal cancer (32.7 %) vs. (28.8 %) and NHL (40 %) vs. (39 %) compared to men. Individuals who received one or more low-value care procedures had significantly higher mean out-of-pocket expenditure ($8,726 ± $7,214) vs. ($6,802 ± $6,102). XGBOOST, a machine learning algorithm revealed that low-value care was among the five leading predictors of OOP expenditure.  Conclusion:   One in four older adults with incident cancer received low-value care in 12-months after a cancer diagnosis. Across all cancer populations, individuals who received low-value care had significantly higher out-of-pocket expenditure. Excess out-of-pocket expenditure was driven by low-value care, fragmentation of care, and an increasing number of pre-existing chronic conditions.

Here, we aimed to establish a comprehensive diagnostic scoring model that can act as a complement to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening. To achieve this, we first drew the landscape of m6A regulators and constructed a LASSO-Cox model using three risk genes (METTL14, HNRNP2AB1, and YTHDF2). Particularly, METTL14 expression was found to be significantly related to overall survival, tumor T stage, relapse rate, and tumor microenvironment of PCa patients, showing that it has important prognostic value.

However, the exact molecular mechanism of PA in human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells remains unclear.  Methods:   DU145 and PC-3 cells were treated with different concentrations of PA for 48 h. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining were used to detect cell proliferation. Scratch tests and transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining and flow cytometry were performed to examine apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential. The expression of the apoptosis- and migration-related proteins and the phosphorylation of the nuclear factor kappa -B (NF-κB) cells were detected by Western blot. A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was conducted to examine NF-κB p65 binding to the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) promoter. A xenograft model of nude mice was established to verify the anticancer effects of PA in vivo.  Results:   PA inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion, and induced the apoptosis of the DU145 and PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, and was accompanied by mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, the upregulation of cleaved caspase-3, cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), and the downregulation of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Ki67, and Mcl-1. In relation to the mechanism, PA significantly downregulated the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) and p65 and the expression of matrix metalloprotein (MMP)-2, MMP-7, MMP-9, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PA prevented p65 binding to the Mcl-1 promoter by inactivating NF-κB p65, downregulated the transcription of Mcl-1, and the silencing of p65 increased the sensitivity of the CRPC cells to PA-induced apoptosis. The overexpression of Mcl-1 significantly reversed the PA-induced apoptosis of the CRPC cells. Additionally, consistent with our in-vitro study, PA inhibited tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model.  Conclusions:   We found that PA inhibits the growth, migration, and invasion of CRPC cells in vitro and in vivo by inducing an apoptosis mechanism and inhibiting NF-κB activity.

In the present study, our findings revealed that MALAT1 plays a critical part in regulating PCa proliferation and glucose metabolism. Knockdown of MALAT1 affects the protein and mRNA levels of MYBL2. In addition, MALAT1 enhances the phosphorylation level of mTOR pathway by upregulating MYBL2. Knockdown of MALAT1 or MYBL2 in PCa cell lines significantly inhibits their proliferation capacity.

ARAP1-AS1, miR-3918, and KIF20A expression levels in bladder cancer cells were determined using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The effects of ARAP1-AS1, miR-3918, and KIF20A on bladder cell activity, proliferation, apoptosis, and in vivo growth were examined using the cell counting kit-8, colony formation, caspase-3 activity, and xenograft tumor growth assays, respectively, in nude mice. The binding relationships among ARAP1-AS1, miR-3918, and KIF20A were analyzed using luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. ARAP1-AS1 and KIF20A were overexpressed in bladder cancer, while miR-3918 was underexpressed. The downregulation of ARAP1-AS1 or KIF20A expression significantly inhibited the viability and proliferation of cancer cells and promoted apoptosis, whereas low expression of miR-3918 or high expression of ARAP1-AS1/KIF20A showed the opposite effect. miR-3918 was sponged by ARAP1-AS1, and targeted KIF20A. In addition, miR-3918 expression was inversely correlated with ARAP1-AS1 and KIF20a expression levels in bladder cancer tissues. In addition, the rescue experiment showed that interference with miR-3918 could reverse the effect of low ARAP1-AS1 or KIF20A expression on bladder cancer cell malignancy.

Patients with advanced PC (aPC) and their spouses are at highest risk for psychological distress and show lower HRQoL compared with couples in other phases. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological interdependencies between HRQoL and anxiety, fear of progression (FoP), and depression in patients with aPC and their spouses.  Methods:   Ninety-six heterosexual couples with aPC participated in this cross-sectional study. Patients and spouses provided information about anxiety and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-4), fear of progression (short form of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire), and HRQoL (EORTC QoL-C30, version 3). Psychological interdependencies were analyzed with various actor-partner interdependence models using structural equation modeling.  Results:   Anxiety, FoP, and depression were significant predictors of HRQoL for patients with aPC and their spouses (actor effects). Spouses' anxiety and FoP were negatively associated with patients' HRQoL (partner effects), showing that patients' HRQoL is associated with their own and their spouses' anxiety and FoP. No partner effect was revealed between depression and HRQoL in the patients or spouses.  Conclusions:   The resulted partner effects between spouses and patients underline the importance of considering HRQoL in patients with aPC from a dyadic perspective. It is important that physicians explore patients' and spouses' needs and psychological burden to offer support and access to psycho-oncological services.

Methods:   The study included 40 men with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve PCa imaged with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT as part of the diagnostic work-up prior to radical prostatectomy. All primary tumors were routinely stained with H&E. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of PSMA was performed and the immunoreactive score (IRS) was computed as semiquantitative measure. Subsequently, imaging findings were correlated to histopathologic results.  Results:   Eighty-three percent (33/40) of patients presented focal uptake of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA I&T in the primary tumor in at least one prostate lobe. Among PSMA-PET positive patients, one-third had lymph node metastases (LNM) detected by post-operative histopathology, while in PET negative patients, only 1 out of 7 presented with regional LN involvement; PSMA-avid distant lesions, predominantly in bones, were observed in 15% and 0% of patients, respectively. The median IRS classification of PSMA expression in tumor tissue was 2 (range, 1-3) both in PSMA-PET positive and negative prostate lobes, with significantly different interquartile range: 2-3 vs. 2-2, respectively (p = 0.03). The median volume of PSMA-PET positive tumors was 5.4 mL (0.2-32.9) as compared to 1.6 mL (0.3-18.3) of PET-negative tumors (p < 0.001). There was a significant but weak correlation between SUVmax and percentage of PSMA-positive tumor cells (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). A total of 35/44 (~80%) lobes were positive in PSMA-PET imaging, when a cut-off percentage of PSMA-positive cells was ≥ 90%, while 19/36 (~53%) lobes with < 90% PSMA-positive cells were PSMA-PET negative.  Conclusion:   Positive [68Ga]Ga-PSMA I&T PET/CT scan of primary tumor of PCa results from a combination of factors, such as homogeneity and intensity of PSMA expression, tumor volume and grade, with a cutoff value of ≥ 90% PSMA-positive cells strongly determining PET-positivity.

The efficacy of this therapy might be further improved by replacing the β-emitting lutetium-177 with the α-emitting actinium-225. Actinium-225 is thought to have a higher therapeutic efficacy due to the high linear energy transfer (LET) of the emitted α-particles, which can increase the amount and complexity of the therapy induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Here we evaluated the relative biological effectiveness of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T by assessing in vitro binding characteristics, dosimetry, and therapeutic efficacy.  Methods and results:   The PSMA-expressing PCa cell line PC3-PIP was used for all in vitro assays. First, binding and displacement assays were performed, which revealed similar binding characteristics between [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T. Next, the assessment of the number of 53BP1 foci, a marker for the number of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), showed that cells treated with [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T had slower DSB repair kinetics compared to cells treated with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T. Additionally, clonogenic survival assays showed that specific targeting with [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T caused a dose-dependent decrease in survival. Lastly, after dosimetric assessment, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T was found to be 4.2 times higher compared to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T.  Conclusion:   We found that labeling of PSMA-I&T with lutetium-177 or actinium-225 resulted in similar in vitro binding characteristics, indicating that the distinct biological effects observed in this study are not caused by a difference in uptake of the two tracers. The slower repair kinetics of [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T compared to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T correlates to the assumption that irradiation with actinium-225 causes more complex, more difficult to repair DSBs compared to lutetium-177 irradiation.

In this study, from RT-qPCR analysis, we discovered that PART1 demonstrated high expression in OC cells. Moreover, data from functional assays manifested that PART1 reduction hindered the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capabilities of OC cells. In vivo uncovered that PART1 knockdown impeded OC tumor growth. Furthermore, from the experimental results of RNA pull down, RIP, and luciferase reporter assays, we discovered that PART1 served as a sponge for microRNA-6884-5p (miR-6884-5p) to modulate the expression of Rac GTPase activating protein 1 (RACGAP1) and ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2). Finally, rescue assays proved that overexpression of RACGAP1 or RRM2 abrogated the suppressive role of PART1 knockdown on OC cell malignant behaviors. RACGAP1 and RRM2 were also revealed to act as oncogenes in OC cells.

Experimental design:   We used RNAseq, digital spatial profiling, and histological assessments from metastatic biopsies and patient-derived xenografts to segregate mCRPCs into subtypes defined by the PAM50 breast cancer classification algorithm. Subtype associations with treatment responses in preclinical models and patients were determined.  Results:   Using the PAM50 algorithm, we partitioned 270 mCRPC tumors into LumA (42%), LumB (24%), and Basal (34%) subtypes with classification largely driven by proliferation rates and androgen receptor (AR) activity. Most neuroendocrine tumors classified as Basal. Pathways enriched in the LumA subtype include TGFß and NOTCH signaling. LumB subtype tumors were notable for elevated MYC activity. Basal subtype tumors exhibited elevated IL6-STAT3 signaling and features of adult stem cell states. In patients where multiple tumors were evaluated, the majority had concordant PAM50 subtype determination, though a subset exhibited marked inter- and intratumor heterogeneity, including divergent classifications between primary and metastatic sites. In preclinical models, LumA subtype tumors were highly responsive to androgen deprivation and docetaxel chemotherapy whereas Basal tumors were largely resistant. In clinical cohorts patients with Basal subtype tumors demonstrated a shorter time on treatment with AR signaling inhibitors and docetaxel relative to patients with luminal subtypes.

However, a significant subset of patients have prostate cancer cells lacking PSMA expression, raising concerns about treatment resistance attributable at least in part to heterogeneous PSMA expression. We have previously demonstrated an association between high PSMA expression and DNA damage repair defects in mCRPC biopsies and therefore hypothesized that DNA damage upregulates PSMA expression.  Experimental design:   To test this relationship between PSMA and DNA damage we conducted a screen of 147 anticancer agents (NCI/NIH FDA-approved anticancer ""Oncology Set"") and treated tumor cells with repeated ionizing irradiation.  Results:   The topoisomerase-2 inhibitors, daunorubicin and mitoxantrone, were identified from the screen to upregulate PSMA protein expression in castration-resistant LNCaP95 cells; this result was validated in vitro in LNCaP, LNCaP95, and 22Rv1 cell lines and in vivo using an mCRPC patient-derived xenograft model CP286 identified to have heterogeneous PSMA expression. As double-strand DNA break induction by topoisomerase-2 inhibitors upregulated PSMA, we next studied the impact of ionizing radiation on PSMA expression; this also upregulated PSMA protein expression in a dose-dependent fashion.  Conclusions:   The results presented herein are the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that PSMA is upregulated in response to double-strand DNA damage by anticancer treatment.

Methods: Forty-one men, 64.0 ± 6.7 y old, were prospectively enrolled. PET images were acquired 42-72 min (median ± SD, 52.5 ± 6.5 min) after injection of 118.4-247.9 MBq (median ± SD, 138.0 ± 22.2 MBq) of 68Ga-RM2. PET findings were compared with preoperative multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) (n = 36) and 68Ga-PSMA11 PET (n = 17) and correlated to postprostatectomy whole-mount histopathology (n = 32) and time to biochemical recurrence. Nine participants decided to undergo radiation therapy after study enrollment. Results: All participants had intermediate- (n = 17) or high-risk (n = 24) PC and were scheduled for prostatectomy. Prostate-specific antigen was 8.8 ± 77.4 (range, 2.5-504) and 7.6 ± 5.3 ng/mL (range, 2.5-28.0 ng/mL) when participants who ultimately underwent radiation treatment were excluded. Preoperative 68Ga-RM2 PET identified 70 intraprostatic foci of uptake in 40 of 41 patients. Postprostatectomy histopathology was available in 32 patients in which 68Ga-RM2 PET identified 50 of 54 intraprostatic lesions (detection rate = 93%). 68Ga-RM2 uptake was recorded in 19 nonenlarged pelvic lymph nodes in 6 patients. Pathology confirmed lymph node metastases in 16 lesions, and follow-up imaging confirmed nodal metastases in 2 lesions. 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET identified 27 and 26 intraprostatic lesions, respectively, and 5 pelvic lymph nodes each in 17 patients. Concordance between 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA11 PET was found in 18 prostatic lesions in 11 patients and 4 lymph nodes in 2 patients. Noncongruent findings were observed in 6 patients (intraprostatic lesions in 4 patients and nodal lesions in 2 patients). Sensitivity and accuracy rates for 68Ga-RM2 and 68Ga-PSMA11 (98% and 89% for 68Ga-RM2 and 95% and 89% for 68Ga-PSMA11) were higher than those for mpMRI (77% and 77%, respectively). Specificity was highest for mpMRI with 75% followed by 68Ga-PSMA11 (67%) and 68Ga-RM2 (65%). Conclusion: 68Ga-RM2 PET accurately detects intermediate- and high-risk primary PC, with a detection rate of 93%. In addition, 68Ga-RM2 PET showed significantly higher specificity and accuracy than mpMRI and a performance similar to 68Ga-PSMA11 PET. These findings need to be confirmed in larger studies to identify which patients will benefit from one or the other or both radiopharmaceuticals.""","""['Heying Duan', 'Lucia Baratto', 'Richard E Fan', 'Simon John Christoph Soerensen', 'Tie Liang', 'Benjamin Inbeh Chung', 'Alan Eih Chih Thong', 'Harcharan Gill', 'Christian Kunder', 'Tanya Stoyanova', 'Mirabela Rusu', 'Andreas M Loening', 'Pejman Ghanouni', 'Guido A Davidzon', 'Farshad Moradi', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Andrei Iagaru']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['A Pilot Study of 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for Biopsy Guidance in Patients with Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'A Pilot Study of 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for Evaluation of Prostate Cancer Response to High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy.', 'Prospective Study of the Radiolabeled GRPR Antagonist BAY86-7548 for Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.', 'PET Imaging Using Gallium-68 (68Ga) RM2.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Modified PROMISE criteria for standardized interpretation of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-targeted PET.', 'Clinical advancement of precision theranostics in prostate cancer.', 'A Pilot Study of 68Ga-PSMA11 and 68Ga-RM2 PET/MRI for Biopsy Guidance in Patients with Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT and 68Ga-RM2 PET/CT in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer Who Are Candidates for Radical Prostatectomy: A Prospective, Single-Arm, Single-Center, Phase II Study.']"""

In prostate cancer, tissue stiffness is known to impact changes in gene and protein expression, alter therapeutic response, and be positively correlated with an aggressive clinical presentation. To inform an appropriate stiffness range for our in vitro model, PC-3 prostate tumor xenografts were established. Tissue stiffness ranged from 95 to 6,750 Pa. Notably, xenograft cell seeding density significantly impacted tumor stiffness; a two-fold increase in the number of seeded cells not only widened the tissue stiffness range throughout the tumor but also resulted in significant spatial heterogeneity. To fabricate our in vitro EPCaT model, PC-3 castration-resistant prostate cancer cells were co-encapsulated with BJ-5ta fibroblasts within a poly(ethylene glycol)-fibrinogen matrix augmented with excess poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate to modulate the matrix mechanical properties. Encapsulated cells temporally remodeled their in vitro microenvironment and enrichment of gene sets associated with tumorigenic progression was observed in response to increased matrix stiffness. Through variation of matrix composition and culture duration, EPCaTs were tuned to mimic the wide range of biomechanical cues provided to PCa cells in vivo; collectively, a range of 50 to 10,000 Pa was achievable. Markedly, this also encompasses published clinical PCa stiffness data. Overall, this study serves to introduce our bioinspired, tunable EPCaT model and provide the foundation for future PCa progression and drug development studies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The development of cancer models that mimic the native tumor microenvironment (TME) complexities is critical to not only develop effective drugs but also enhance our understanding of disease progression. Here we establish and characterize our 3D in vitro engineered prostate cancer tissue model with tunable matrix stiffness, that is inspired by this study's spatial characterization of in vivo prostate tumor xenograft stiffness. Notably, our model's mimicry of the TME is further augmented by the inclusion of matrix remodeling fibroblasts to introduce cancer-stromal cell-cell interactions. This study addresses a critical unmet need in the field by elucidating the prostate tumor xenograft stiffness range and establishing a foundation for recapitulating the biomechanics of site-of-origin and soft tissue metastatic prostate tumors in vitro.""","""['Nicole L Habbit', 'Benjamin Anbiah', 'Luke Anderson', 'Joshita Suresh', 'Iman Hassani', 'Matthew Eggert', 'Andrew Brannen', 'Joshua Davis', 'Yuan Tian', 'Balabhaskar Prabhakarpandian', 'Peter Panizzi', 'Robert D Arnold', 'Elizabeth A Lipke']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['Bioengineered 3D brain tumor model to elucidate the effects of matrix stiffness on glioblastoma cell behavior using PEG-based hydrogels.', 'A 3D in\xa0vitro model of patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft for controlled interrogation of in\xa0vivo tumor-stromal interactions.', 'In-air production of 3D co-culture tumor spheroid hydrogels for expedited drug screening.', 'Tissue-engineered 3D models for elucidating primary and metastatic bone cancer progression.', 'Breast cancer models: Engineering the tumor microenvironment.']"""

Cancer treatment in eldery people is challenging due to fragility and comorbidities of these patients. To meet the needs of treating UN in the eldery, it is necessary to optimize healthcare resources, for which a deep analysis of cancer registries becomes mandatory. The objective of this work was to provide a detailed analysis of the incidence and mortality of UN in Spanish people over 65 years old in the last year 2020, as well as the estimates for the year 2040.  Material and methods:   Incidence and mortality estimates were obtained from the GLOBOCAN database. The urological neoplasms that were included were: testicle, bladder, penis, kidney and prostate.  Results:   In 2020, 63,278 cases of UN were diagnosed in Spain. Most UN were much more frequent among patients >65 years old, except for testicular cancers. For the year 2040, an incidence increase of 41.5% is estimated, reaching 89,507 new cases of UN per year, with approximately 3 out of 4 patients being over 65 years old. Deaths in people over 65 will increase by 60.15% in 2040.  Conclusion:   In the next two decades, it is expected that new cases UN in people over 65 years will increase above 50%.

As modest clinical benefits of IL-2 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for early-stage bladder cancers in the past years, immune checkpoint inhibitors therapies demonstrate meaningful survival benefit and durable clinical response in renal cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and some prostate cancer. Despite best efforts, the benefits are limited to a minority of unselected patients due to the complexities of biomarker development. Now come the next hurdles: figuring out which patients best respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors and which patients won't respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors? How best to approach immune checkpoint inhibitors therapies to extend/maximize the treatment response as long as possible? How to overcome therapeutic resistance by specific concurrent immunomodulators or targeted therapy or chemotherapy? The role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination or sequencing with chemotherapy or other targeted therapies or other immunomodulating therapeutics in the early disease, neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and metastatic setting is actively under exploration. Ideal strategy for cancer care is to provide not just more time, but more quality time: there remain unmet needs for novel therapies that exploit molecular or genetic pathways to extend survival without compromising health-related quality of life for patients with advanced genitourinary malignancies.

The concept of harnessing the immune system for this purpose originated over 100 years ago when a physician by the name of William Coley successfully treated several of his cancer patients with a combination of live and attenuated bacteria, later known as ""Coley's Toxins"", after observing a subset of prior patients enter remission following their diagnosis with the common bacterial infection, erysipelas. However, it was not until late in the twentieth century that cancer immunotherapies were developed for widespread use, thereby transforming the treatment landscape of numerous cancer types. Pivotal studies elucidating molecular and cellular functions of immune cells, such as the discovery of IL-2 and production of monoclonal antibodies, fostered the development of novel techniques for studying the immune system and ultimately the development and approval of several cancer immunotherapies by the United States Food and Drug Association in the 1980s and 1990s, including the tuberculosis vaccine-Bacillus Calmette-Guérin, IL-2, and the CD20-targeting monoclonal antibody. Approval of the first therapeutic cancer vaccine, Sipuleucel-T, for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and the groundbreaking success and approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy in the last decade, have driven an explosion of interest in and pursuit of novel cancer immunotherapy strategies. A broad range of modalities ranging from antibodies to adoptive T cell therapies is under investigation for the generalized treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers as well as personalized medicine.

Methods:   From 2002 to 2019, 744 consecutive patients received either EBRT or EBRT + HDR-BT boost, of whom 516 patients were propensity score matched. Median follow-up was 95.3 months. Cone beam CT image-guided EBRT consisted of 33 fractions of intensity-modulated radiation therapy with simultaneous integrated boost up to 76.23 Gy (DMean). Combined treatment was delivered as 46 Gy (DMean) EBRT, followed by two fractions HDR-BT boost with 9 Gy (D90%). Propensity score matching was applied before analysis of the primary endpoint, estimated 10-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), and the secondary endpoints metastasis-free survival (MFS) and overall survival (OS).

This study aims to evaluate the usage and performance of MRI as an advanced risk stratification tool of elevated PSA prior to biopsy and identify factors associated with differential utilization of MRI at a large academic setting with ready access to 3T multiparametric MRI of the prostate.  Methods:   A retrospective single-center study of 2900 men presenting with elevated PSA 2-20 ng/mL from 2018 through 2021 was conducted. We analyzed trends in MRI utilization and outcomes of prostate biopsy by MRI usage. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to calculate odds ratios to identify patient- and provider-level predictors of MRI usage.  Results:   Rates of prebiopsy MRI utilization increased from 56% in 2018 to 89% in 2021 (p < 0.001). Prebiopsy MRI led to biopsy avoidance in 31% of men. MRI usage enhanced detection of clinically significant prostate cancer by 13% and reduced identification of Gleason Grade Group 1 disease by 3% and negative biopsies by 10% (p < 0.001). Men who received MRI were more likely to be younger than 75 years in age and have private or Medicare insurance, PSA >4 ng/mL, and PHI >27. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, black race and Medicaid insurance were associated with reduced MRI utilization (all p < 0.001). Urologic provider was an independent predictor of MRI usage (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Use of MRI as a risk stratification tool for elevated PSA rose during this 4-year study period.

Non-metastatic Dunning R-3327 G (G) tumor cells, metastatic MatLyLu (MLL) tumor cells, or vehicle were injected into the prostate of immunocompetent rats. All animals received daily injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), to label cells/daughter cells with active DNA synthesis. Equal sized G- and MLL-tumors, similarly increased BrdU-labeling in the prostate, lymph nodes and liver compared to tumor-free controls. Prior to metastasis, MLL-tumors also increased BrdU-labeling in bone marrow and lungs compared to animals with G-tumors or controls. In animals with MLL-tumors, BrdU-labeling in prostate, lungs, brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscles increased in a tumor-size-dependent way. Furthermore, MLL-tumors induced increased signs of DNA damage (γH2AX staining) and accumulation of CD68 + macrophages in the lungs. In conclusion, small localized prostate cancers increased DNA synthesis in several remote tissues in a tumor type- and size-dependent way.

Herein, DU145 cell lines with stable overexpression and knockdown of ADAM10 were constructed. We found that ectopic expression of ADAM10 not only significantly facilitated cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibited apoptosis, but also could specifically hydrolyze ephrin-A5 and release the ephrin-A5 soluble ectodomain into extracellular media in vitro. These effects were reversed by ADAM10 depletion or treatment of GI254023X. Meanwhile, the co-location and physical interaction among EphA3, ephrin-A5, and ADAM10 were observed in PCa cells using immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation techniques. Interestingly, overexpression of EphA3 exerted opposite effects in DU145 (ephrin-A5 + ) cells and PC-3 (ephrin-A5 ± ) cells. In addition, the pro-tumor function of EphA3 was reversed by the treatment with the exogenous ephrin-A5-Fc, which increased the phosphorylation level of EphA3 in PC-3 (ephrin-A5 ± ) cells. In nude mice, ADAM10 accelerated growth of the primary tumor, decreased the level of ephrin-A5 in the tumor tissue, but increased the level of ephrin-A5 in the peripheral blood, accompanied with an increase in the expression of CD31 and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) in the tissue. What is more, the serum ephrin-A5 content of patients with metastatic PCa was significantly higher than that of the non-metastatic group (P < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic curve(ROC) showed that the area under the curve(AUC) of serum ephrin-A5 as a marker of PCa metastasis was 0.843, with a sensitivity of 93.5% and a specificity of 75%. It is concluded that ADAM10-mediated ephrin-A5 shedding promotes PCa metastasis via transforming the role of EphA3 from ligand-dependent tumor suppressor to ligand-independent promoter, and ephrin-A5 in the blood can be used as a new biomarker for PCa metastasis.""","""['Chenchen Cai#', 'Miaomiao Zhang#', 'Lei Liu#', 'Haoliang Zhang', 'Yi Guo', 'Ting Lan', 'Yinhai Xu', 'Ping Ma', 'Shibao Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Adam meets Eph: an ADAM substrate recognition module acts as a molecular switch for ephrin cleavage in trans.', 'Concurrent binding of anti-EphA3 antibody and ephrin-A5 amplifies EphA3 signaling and downstream responses: potential as EphA3-specific tumor-targeting reagents.', 'ADAM and Eph: how Ephrin-signaling cells become detached.', 'Regulation of the trafficking and the function of the metalloprotease ADAM10 by tetraspanins.', 'Role of ADAM10 in intestinal crypt homeostasis and tumorigenesis.', 'Potential impact of ADAM-10 genetic variants with the clinical features of oral squamous cell carcinoma.', 'MAP4K4 promotes ovarian cancer metastasis through diminishing ADAM10-dependent N-cadherin cleavage.']"""

Adopting new technologies such as remote electronic consent (e-Consent) can help overcome them. However, guidelines for e-Consent implementation in ongoing clinical trials are currently lacking. The NeuroSAFE PROOF trial is a randomized clinical trial evaluating the role of frozen section analysis during RARP for prostate cancer. In response to the COVID-19 crisis, recruitment was halted, and a remote e-Consent solution was designed. The aim of this paper is to describe the process of implementation, impact on recruitment rate, and patients' experience using e-Consent.  Methods:   A substantial amendment of the protocol granted the creation of a remote e-Consent framework based on the REDCap environment, following the structure and content of the already approved paper consent form. Although e-Consent obviated the need for in-person meeting, there was nonetheless counselling sessions performed interactively online. This new pathway offered continuous support to patients through remote consultations. The whole process was judged to be compliant with regulatory requirements before implementation.  Results:   Before the first recruitment suspension, NeuroSAFE PROOF was recruiting an average of 9 patients per month. After e-Consent implementation, 63 new patients (4/month) have been enrolled despite a second lockdown, none of whom would have been recruited using the old methods given restrictions on face-to-face consultations. Patients have given positive feedback on the use of the platform. Limited troubleshooting has been required after implementation.  Conclusion:   Remote e-Consent-based recruitment was critical for the continuation of the NeuroSAFE PROOF trial during the COVID-19 pandemic. The described pathway complies with ethical and regulatory guidelines for informed consent, while minimizing face-to-face interactions that increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission. This guide will help researchers integrate e-Consent to ongoing or planned clinical trials while uncertainty about the course of the pandemic continues.

Nearly all patients develop resistance to AR-targeted therapies (ARTs). Our previous work identified CREB5 as an upregulated target gene in human mCRPC that promoted resistance to all clinically approved ART. The mechanisms by which CREB5 promotes progression of mCRPC or other cancers remains elusive. Integrating ChIP-seq and rapid immunoprecipitation and mass spectroscopy of endogenous proteins, we report that cells overexpressing CREB5 demonstrate extensive reprogramming of nuclear protein-protein interactions in response to the ART agent enzalutamide. Specifically, CREB5 physically interacts with AR, the pioneering actor FOXA1, and other known co-factors of AR and FOXA1 at transcription regulatory elements recently found to be active in mCRPC patients. We identified a subset of CREB5/FOXA1 co-interacting nuclear factors that have critical functions for AR transcription (GRHL2, HOXB13) while others (TBX3, NFIC) regulated cell viability and ART resistance and were amplified or overexpressed in mCRPC. Upon examining the nuclear protein interactions and the impact of CREB5 expression on the mCRPC patient transcriptome, we found that CREB5 was associated with Wnt signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal transitions, implicating these pathways in CREB5/FOXA1-mediated ART resistance.

Understanding cellular mechanisms, including ATP-dependent metabolisms, is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment, including drug development and investigation of new therapeutic systems. As an ATP-dependent metabolism, endocytosis plays a key role not only in the internalization of molecules but also in processes including cell growth, differentiation, and signaling. To understand cellular mechanisms including endocytosis, many techniques ranging from molecular approaches to spectroscopy are used. Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is shown to provide valuable label-free molecular information from living cells. In this study, receptor-mediated endocytosis was investigated with SERS by inhibiting endocytosis with ATP depletion agents: sodium azide (NaN3) and 2-deoxy-d-glucose (dG). Human lung bronchial epithelium (Beas-2b) cells, normal prostate epithelium (PNT1A) cells, and cervical cancer epithelium (HeLa) cells were used as models. First, the effect of NaN3 and dG on the cells were examined through cytotoxicity, apoptosis-necrosis, ATP assay, and uptake inhibition analysis. An attempt to relate the spectral changes in the cellular spectra to the studied cellular events, receptor-mediated endocytosis inhibition, was made. It was found that the effect of two different ATP depletion agents can be discriminated by SERS, and hence receptor-mediated endocytosis can be tracked from single living cells with the technique without using a label and with limited sample preparation.""","""['Deniz Yılmaz', 'Mustafa Culha']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Langmuir""","""['Investigation of the pathway dependent endocytosis of gold nanoparticles by surface-enhanced Raman scattering.', 'Recycling of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in isolated rat hepatocytes.

Aim:   To study differential expression patterns of the AIP, UCKL1, and PKN1 genes in blood sera and tumor tissue of patients with PC with different Gleason scores.  Materials and methods:   The total extracellular RNA was isolated from blood sera of 44 PC patients and 4 healthy donors. cDNAs were synthesized and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed. Immunohistochemical study of the UCKL, AIP and PKN1 proteins was performed on deparaffinized sections of tumors. The study was supplemented by a bioinformatic analysis of the publicly available databases.  Results:   The UCKL1, AIP, PKN1 genes were overexpressed at the mRNA level in blood sera of PC patients, compared to healthy donors. Extracellular mRNA levels of AIP and UCKL-1 were 100-1000-fold increased in all PC samples compared to the healthy donors but without significant inequality between the groups of PC cases differing by the Gleason score. The highest levels were detected in the samples from PC patients with the Gleason score > 9. The PKN1 expression was higher in PC patients compared with healthy donors but without significant difference between the groups.  Conclusions:   From the three chosen genes, AIP and UCKL1 showed similar pattern of expression assessed either by extracellular mRNA levels in patient sera or the protein in PC tissues. AIP was up to 1000-fold increased in all PC samples, compared to the healthy donors, with the highest levels in PC cases with Gleason score > 9.

METHODS DCE image data of 50 consecutive patients with PCa who underwent multiparametric MRI were analyzed retrospectively with three different methods of AIF acquisition. First, a region of interest was manually defined in an artery (AIFm); second, an automated algorithm was used (AIFa); and third, a population-based AIF (AIFp) was applied. Values of quantitative parameters after Tofts (Ktrans, ve, and kep) in PCa, PZ, and TZ in the three different AIFs were analyzed. RESULTS Ktrans and kep were significantly higher in PCa than in benign tissue independent from the AIF method. Whereas in PZ, Ktrans and kep could differentiate PCa (P < .001), in TZ only kep using AIFpdemonstrated a significant difference (P = .039). The correlations of the perfusion parameters that resulted from AIFm and AIFa were higher than those that resulted from AIFp, and the absolute values of Ktrans, kep, and ve were significantly lower when using AIFp. The values of quantitative perfusion parameters for PCa were similar regardless of whether PCa was located in PZ or TZ.

Among the 32 genes, the Fifth Ewing Variant (FEV) gene was one of the top downregulated genes in relapsed PCa. However, current understanding of the FEV gene and its involvement in PCa is limited.  Methods:   FEV mRNA expression was analyzed and correlated to clinical outcomes in PCa patients who underwent prostatectomy at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Specimens from tissue microarray (TMA) including 102 prostate cancer patients were analysis for the expression of FEV. Meanwhile, FEV expression profiles were also assessed in PCa cell lines and in BPH-1 prostate epithelial cells using western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, we transfected LNCaP and PC-3 cells with either an empty vector or full-length FEV gene and performed in vitro cell functional assays. The part FEV plays in tumor xenograft growth was also assessed in vivo.  Results:   Of the 191 patients included in this study base on the DASL dataset, 77 (40.3%) and 24 (13.6%), respectively, developed prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse and metastasis postradical prostatectomy. Significant FEV downregulation was observed in PCa patients showing PSA failure and metastasis. The protein expression of FEV was significantly negatively correlated with the Gleason score and pathological stage in prostate cancer tissues. Similarly, FEV expression significantly decreased in all PCa cell lines relative to BPH-1 (all P < 0.05). Functional assays revealed that FEV expression markedly inhibited PCa cell growth, migration, and invasion, which in turn significantly repressed the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo.  Conclusion:   The results of this study suggest an association between downregulated FEV expression and PSA relapse in PCa patients.

The present study aims to establish the spatial epidemiology of cancer burden in Africa and delineate the association between cancer burden and the country-level socioeconomic status. The study also examines the forecasts of the cancer burden for 2040 and evaluates infrastructure availability across all African countries.  Methods:   The estimates of age, sex, and country-specific incidence and mortality of 34 neoplasms in 54 African countries, were procured from GLOBOCAN 2020. Mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was employed as a proxy indicator of 5-year survival rates, and the socioeconomic development of each country was measured using its human development index (HDI). We regressed age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and MIR on HDI using linear regression model to determine the relationship between cancer burden and HDI. Maps were generated for each cancer group for each country in Africa. The data about the cancer infrastructure of African countries were extracted from the WHO Cancer Country Profiles.  Results:   In Africa, an estimated 1.1 million new cases [95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) 1.0 - 1.3 million] and 711,429 [611,604 - 827,547] deaths occurred due to neoplasms in 2020. The ASIR was estimated to be 132.1/100,000, varying from 78.4/100,000 (Niger) to 212.5/100,000 (La Réunion) in 2020. The ASMR was 88.8/100,000 in Africa, ranging from 56.6/100,000 in the Republic of the Congo to 139.4/100,000 in Zimbabwe. The MIR of all cancer combined was 0.64 in Africa, varying from 0.49 in Mauritius to 0.78 in The Gambia. HDI had a significant negative correlation with MIR of all cancer groups combined and main cancer groups (prostate, breast, cervical and colorectal). HDI explained 75% of the variation in overall 5-year cancer survival (MIR). By 2040, the burden of all neoplasms combined is forecasted to increase to 2.1 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths in Africa.  Conclusion:   High cancer mortality rates in Africa demand a holistic approach toward cancer control and management, including, but not limited to, boosting cancer awareness, adopting primary and secondary prevention, mitigating risk factors, improving cancer infrastructure and timely treatment.""","""['Rajesh Sharma', 'Aashima', 'Mehak Nanda', 'Claudio Fronterre', 'Paul Sewagudde', 'Anna E Ssentongo', 'Kelsey Yenney', 'Nina D Arhin', 'John Oh', 'Forster Amponsah-Manu', 'Paddy Ssentongo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Public Health""","""['An examination of colorectal cancer burden by socioeconomic status: evidence from GLOBOCAN 2018.', 'Mapping of global, regional and national incidence, mortality and mortality-to-incidence ratio of lung cancer in 2020 and 2050.', 'Global, regional, national burden of breast cancer in 185 countries: evidence from GLOBOCAN 2018.', 'Cancer in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020: a review of current estimates of the national burden, data gaps, and future needs.', 'Tuberculosis.', 'The association between HIV infection and precancerous cervical lesion.

Recently, overexpression of PROL1 was shown to be associated with prostate cancer, with evidence of a role in overcoming the hypoxic barrier that develops as tumors grow. The primary goal of the present studies was to support and expand evidence for a role of PROL1 in the development and progression of prostate cancer.  Material and methods:   We engineered knock-out of the opiorphin gene, PROL1, in LNCaP, an androgen-sensitive, human prostate cancer derived, cell-line. Using xenograft assays, we compared the ability of injected LNCaP PROL1 knock-out cell-lines to develop tumors in both castrated and intact male mice with the parental LNCaP and LNCaP PROL1 overexpressing cell-lines. We used RNAseq to compare global gene expression between the parental and LNCaP PROL1 knock-out cell-lines. Wound closure and 3D spheroid invasion assays were used to compare cell motility and migration between parental LNCaP cells and LNCaP cells overexpressing of PROL1.  Results:   The present studies demonstrate that LNCaP cell-lines with consisitutive knock-out of PROL1 fail to develop tumors when injected into both castrated and intact male mice. Using RNAseq to compare global gene expression between the parental and LNCaP PROL1 knock-out cell-lines, we confirmed a role for PROL1 in regulating molecular pathways associated with angiogenesis and tumor blood supply, and also identified a potential role in pathways related to cell motility and migration. Through the use of wound closure and 3D spheroid invasion assays, we confirmed that overexpression of PROL1 in LNCaP cells leads to greater cell motility and migration compared to parental cells, suggesting that PROL1 overexpression results in a more invasive phenotype.  Conclusion:   Overall, our studies add to the growing body of evidence that opiorphin-encoding genes play a role in cancer development and progression. PROL1 is essential for establishment and growth of tumors in mice injected with LNCaP cells, and we provide evidence that PROL1 has a possible role in progression towards a more invasive, metastatic and castration resistant prostate cancer (PrCa).""","""['Amarnath Mukherjee', 'Augene Park', 'Kelvin Paul Davies']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Mens Health""","""['Role of opiorphin genes in prostate cancer growth and progression.', 'LNCaP progression model of human prostate cancer: androgen-independence and osseous metastasis.', 'Derivation of androgen-independent human LNCaP prostatic cancer cell sublines: role of bone stromal cells.', 'Overexpression of bcl-2 protects prostate cancer cells from apoptosis in vitro and confers resistance to androgen depletion in vivo.', 'The opiorphin gene (ProL1) and its homologues function in erectile physiology.', 'BTF3 promotes proliferation and glycolysis in hepatocellular carcinoma by regulating GLUT1.']"""

Here, we employed a counterintuitive approach of overexpressing Yamanaka factors (Oct4, c-Myc, Sox2, and Klf4) and examined a conditioned medium (CM)-based treatment option with induced tumor-suppressing cells (iTSCs). Methods:In vitro proliferation and migration assays were conducted using tumor cell lines derived from breast cancer, as well as prostate and pancreatic cancers, and osteosarcoma. The tumor-suppressing capability of iTSC-derived CM was evaluated using freshly isolated breast cancer tissues and a mouse model of mammary tumors and tumor-induced osteolysis. The regulatory mechanism was evaluated using Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, pull-down, gene overexpression, and RNA interference based on mass spectrometry-based proteomics data. Results: The overexpression of Oct4 and c-Myc in tumor cells and MSCs, but not Sox2 or Klf4, generated anti-tumor CM, which suppressed the progression of mammary tumors and tumor-induced bone loss. Notably, CM downregulated histone demethylase, and PDL-1, a blocker of T-cell-based immune responses. Whole-genome proteomics predicted enolase 1 (Eno1), Hsp90ab1, Eef2, and vinculin as extracellular tumor suppressors. Specifically, CD44 was co-immunoprecipitated with Eno1 and the silencing of CD44 suppressed Eno1's anti-tumor action. The overexpression of Oct4 and c-Myc also generated secretomes that inhibited the development of bone-resorbing osteoclasts.

However, their clinical impact should not be underestimated, considering their potential for local aggressive behavior and strong association with von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Therefore, early detection with emerging theragnostic examinations such as 68Ga-DOTATATE-PET/CT might improve patient management and reduce morbidity.  Methods:   We report the clinicopathological features of seven endolymphatic sac tumors. In this cohort, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of somatostatin receptor 2A (SSTR2A) and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) protein expression patterns; two targets providing rationale for novel imaging modalities such as PSMA- or SSTR-targeted PET.  Results:   The tumor cells of all cases were negative for prostate specific membrane antigen and somatostatin receptor 2A, however immunolabeling was consistently detected in intratumoral endothelial cells of endolymphatic sac tumors for PSMA (7/7 cases, 100%), and for SSTR2A (5/7 cases, 71%).  Conclusions:   Our results show a high rate of PSMA and SSTR2A expression in the tumor vasculature of endolymphatic sac tumors. PSMA and SSTR2A can be targeted with appropriate radioligands for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

During a mean follow-up of 10 years, there were 4314 deaths from all causes including 1235 cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths and 868 cancer deaths. Ancestry-stratified meta-analysis of all-cause mortality identified 163 CpGs in European ancestry (EA) and 17 in African ancestry (AA) participants at p < 1 × 10-7 , of which 41 (EA) and 16 (AA) were also associated with CVD death, and 15 (EA) and 9 (AA) with cancer death. We built DNAm-based prediction models for all-cause mortality that predicted mortality risk after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The mortality prediction model trained by integrating DNAm with clinical risk factors showed an improvement in prediction of cancer death with 5% increase in the C-index in a replication cohort, compared with the model including clinical risk factors alone. Mendelian randomization identified 15 putatively causal CpGs in relation to longevity, CVD, or cancer risk. For example, cg06885782 (in KCNQ4) was positively associated with risk for prostate cancer (Beta = 1.2, PMR = 4.1 × 10-4 ) and negatively associated with longevity (Beta = -1.9, PMR = 0.02).

Results:   556 vertebrae were analyzed. 326 of 556 (59%) lumbar vertebrae had degenerative changes. The vertebral CT-HU value was positively correlated with the lumbar BMD T-score, with higher correlation coefficients observed in vertebrae without degenerative changes (r = 0.655, N = 230) when compared to vertebrae with degenerative changes (r = 0.575, N = 326).

Inclusion criteria were adenocarcinoma of the prostate; class risk of low, intermediate, and high; and a World Health Organization performance status of 0-2. Quality of life was measured using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P).  Results:   A total of 439 patients were treated with SBRT, with a median age of 73 years old.

FACT-P Trial Outcome Index (p < 0.0001), FACT-General (p = 0.0003), and FACT-P-Total (p < 0.0001) scores declined at 1 month post-SBRT, then recovered and returned to the same level as before treatment at 3-4 months post-SBRT. The decrease in quality of life in the first month was particularly remarkable in patients who received long-term hormone injections (36%). One month after the end of SBRT, about 22% of patients experienced ""quite a bit"" or more troubling side effects.

Methods:   In this retrospective and randomized study, 239 annotated and histopathologically correlated prostate lesions (104 positive and 135 negative for prostate cancer) were rated twice by three experienced uroradiologists using PI-RADS v2 and v2.1 with an interval of at least two months between readings. Results were tabulated across readers and reading timepoints and inter-reader variability was determined using Fleiss' kappa (κ). Thereafter, an additional analysis of the data was performed in which PI-RADS scores 1 and 2 were combined, as they have the same clinical consequences.  Results:   PI-PI-RADS v2.1 showed better inter-reader agreement in the peripheral zone (PZ), but poorer inter-reader agreement in the transition zone (TZ) (PZ: κ = 0.63 vs. κ = 0.58; TZ: κ = 0.47 vs. κ = 0.57). When PI-RADS scores 1 and 2 were combined, the use of PI-RADS v2.1 resulted in almost perfect inter-reader agreement in the PZ and substantial agreement in the TZ (PZ: κ = 0.81; TZ: κ = 0.80).  Conclusion:   PI-RADS v2.1 improves inter-reader agreement in the PZ. New differences in inter-reader agreement were mainly the result of the assignment of PI-RADS v2.1 scores 1 and 2 to lesions in the TZ. Combining scores 1 and 2 improved inter-reader agreement both in the TZ and in the PZ, indicating that refined definitions may be warranted for these PI-RADS scores.  Key points:   · PI-RADSv2.1 improves inter-reader agreement in the PZ but not in the TZ.. · New differences derived from PI-RADSv2.1 scores 1 and 2 in the TZ.. · Combined PI-RADSv2.1 scores of 1 and 2 yielded better inter-reader agreement.. · PI-RADSv2.1 appears to provide more precise description of lesions in the PZ.. · Improved inter-reader agreement in the PZ stresses the importance of appropriate lexicon description..

Synergistic chemotherapy has become prominent with the stimulus-response drug delivery system (DDS) to treat solid malignancies. The most popularly employed responsive stimulus is reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is proven to primarily sensitize chemotherapy and enhance antitumor impact. In this study, we have successfully developed smart dual responsive nanocarriers with ROS self-amplification, particularly responding to disassemble under the high levels of ROS and esterase in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and to release docetaxel (DTX) efficiently. Additionally, we utilized palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) as a stabilizer by taking advantage of its amphiphilic structure. PA is also an excellent ROS generator that produces a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in TME to achieve ROS self-amplification. Also, elevated levels of ROS could continue to activate ROS-sensitive thioketal and make the remaining nanocarriers disassemble for sustaining the release of chemotherapeutics, realizing a positive feedback loop for ROS generation and ROS amplification, as well as sensitizing chemotherapy efficacy. The smart dual responsive nanocarriers may serve as a promising and prospective strategy for treating prostate cancer and promoting synergistic cancer therapy.""","""['Yupeng Guan', 'Chengyuan Xing', 'Tongyu Tong', 'Xinyi Zhang', 'Jun Li', 'Huikun Chen', 'Junfeng Zhu', 'Yang Kang', 'Jun Pang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Colloid Interface Sci""","""['Efficacy-shaping nanomedicine by loading Calcium Peroxide into Tumor Microenvironment-responsive Nanoparticles for the Antitumor Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Self-sufficing H2O2-responsive nanocarriers through tumor-specific H2O2 production for synergistic oxidation-chemotherapy.', 'Reactive oxygen species and glutathione dual responsive nanoparticles for enhanced prostate cancer therapy.', 'Reactive oxygen species-sensitive polymeric nanocarriers for synergistic cancer therapy.', 'Reactive oxygen species stimuli-responsive nanocarriers.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the stereochemistry of the incorporated ibuprofen affects the radioligand's in vitro and in vivo properties and to select the more favorable radioligand for further development. For this purpose, SibuDAB and RibuDAB containing (S)- and (R)-ibuprofen, respectively, were synthesized and labeled with lutetium-177. In vitro, the two isomers had similar properties; however, [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB showed increased binding to mouse and human plasma proteins (91 ± 1 and 88 ± 2%, respectively) compared to [177Lu]Lu-RibuDAB (75 ± 2 and 79 ± 2%, respectively). In vivo, [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB was metabolically more stable than [177Lu]Lu-RibuDAB with ∼90 vs ∼67% intact radioligand detected in the blood at 4 h post injection (p.i.). In line with the lower albumin-binding affinity, the blood clearance of [177Lu]Lu-RibuDAB in mice was considerably faster [27% of injected activity (% IA), 1 h p.i.] than for [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB (50% IA, 1 h p.i.). Time-dependent biodistribution studies performed in tumor-bearing athymic nude mice showed high PSMA-specific tumor uptake for both isomers. A twofold increased area under the curve (AUC0→8d) of the blood retention was determined for [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB as compared to [177Lu]Lu-RibuDAB, whereas the kidney AUC0→8d value of [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB was only half as high as for [177Lu]Lu-RibuDAB. As a result, a more favorable tumor-to-kidney AUC0→8d ratio was obtained for [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB, which was also visualized on SPECT/CT images. Based on its improved kidney clearance and higher metabolic stability, [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB was selected as the more favorable radioligand. Therapy studies performed with [177Lu]Lu-SibuDAB (5 MBq/mouse) demonstrated the anticipated therapeutic superiority over the current gold-standard [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (5 MBq/mouse).

So far, no large histopathological validation study has been conducted. The objective was to determine diagnostic accuracy of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT compared to histopathological results of extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) in men with intermediate- or high-risk PCa.  Methods:   Men with newly confirmed intermediate- or high-risk PCa were prospectively enrolled in the Molecular Imaging 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT for lymph Node sTaging in primary PCa (MINT) trial. PET/CT images were read by two nuclear medicine physicians. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by histopathology of template resections. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) for LNI detection of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT were calculated.  Results:   Ninety-nine men were evaluated; 30.3% showed histologically confirmed LNI. Median number of resected nodes was 22 (IQR 17-28). Patient-based sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 53.3% (95% CI 34.3-71.7%), 89.9% (95% CI 80.2-95.8%), 69.6% (95% CI 51.2-83.3%), and 81.6% (95% CI 75.0-86.8%), respectively. Template-based sensitivity was 12.9% (95% CI 5.7-23.9%), specificity 97.7% (95% CI 96.6-98.5%), PPV 23.5% (95% CI 12.7-39.5%), and NPV 95.3% (95% CI 94.9-95.7%).  Conclusion: 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT showed high specificity but moderate to low sensitivity for LNI detection in intermediate- and high-risk PCa. It cannot replace ePLND for staging.

Patients and methods:   Progressive mCRPC patients who received at least 1 cycle of LuPSMA therapy were evaluated retrospectively. Demographic, clinic, and histopathological data were documented. Treatment efficacy was determined based on biochemical response criteria (Prostate Cancer Clinical Trial Working Group 3), and toxicity rates were defined based on CTCAE v4.03. The prognostic significance of laboratory/clinical data and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT quantitative results were analyzed using SPSS Version 24.0.  Results:   One hundred patients (median prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, 75.7 ng/mL) who met the eligibility criteria were identified. The median number of cycles received per patient was 3 (range, 1-9). After the first cycles of LuPSMA, biochemical partial response, biochemical stable disease, and biochemical progressive disease were observed in 31%, 36%, and 33% of patients, respectively.

After the fourth cycle of treatment, biochemical partial response, biochemical stable disease, and biochemical progressive disease were defined in 48%, 26%, and 26% of patients, respectively. The median overall survival (OS) from the first cycle of LuPSMA was 14 months. Patients who had any PSA response after the first cycle had significantly longer OS than nonresponders (median OS: 17 vs 9 months; P ≤ 0.001).

To solve this problem, this study uses deep learning to provide fast 3D dose prediction for prostate cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT).  Methods:   A novel recurrent U-net (RU-net) architecture was trained to predict the 3D dose distribution. Doses, CT images, and beam spot information from IMPT plans were used to train the RU-net with a five-fold cross-validation. However, predicting the complicated dose properties of the IMPT plan is difficult for neural networks. Instead of the peak-monitor unit (MU) model, this work develops the multi-MU model that adopted more comprehensive inputs and was trained with a combinational loss function. The dose difference between the prediction dose and Monte Carlo (MC) dose was evaluated with gamma analysis, dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and dose-volume histogram (DVH) metrics. The MC dropout was also added to the network to quantify the uncertainty of the model.  Results:   Compared to the peak-MU model, the multi-MU model led to smaller mean absolute errors (3.03% vs. 2.05%, p = 0.005), higher gamma-passing rate (2 mm, 3%: 97.42% vs. 93.69%, p = 0.005), higher dice similarity coefficient, and smaller relative DVH metrics error (clinical target volume (CTV) D98% : 3.03% vs. 6.08%, p = 0.017; in Bladder V30: 3.08% vs. 5.28%, p = 0.028; and in Bladder V20: 3.02% vs. 4.42%, p = 0.017).

Research suggests up to 50% of patients on AS will discontinue within 5 years, though reasons for discontinuation from the patient's perspective is under-explored.  Methods:   Prostate cancer patients who were or had been on AS for at least 6 months were recruited. A questionnaire assessed reasons for receiving/considering definitive treatment and the extent to which reasons were personal or medical. Clinical information was extracted from a state-level population registry. A subset of participants were interviewed to further explore questionnaire responses.  Results:   One-hundred and-three individuals completed the survey; 33 were also interviewed. Fifty-four survey participants (52%) had discontinued AS for definitive treatment. Common reasons for discontinuation were evidence of disease progression, doctor recommendation, desire to act, and fear of progression. Many participants who considered or had treatment reported weighing medical and personal factors equally in their decision. Interview participants described strongly considering any amount of disease progression and personal factors such as fear of progression, family concerns, and adverse vicarious experiences when deciding whether to pursue treatment.

However, functions of SCARA3 in various cancers remain unclear. In this study, we tried to evaluate the functional study of SCARA3 in lung cancer.  Methods:   The expression level of SCARA3 in the TCGA-database, lung cancer tissue microarray and lung cancer cells and the prognosis of lung cancer patients were measured. Lung cancer tissue microarray was analyzed pathologically using immunohistochemistry, and quantitative analysis of SCARA3 in normal lung cells and lung cancer cells was analyzed using western blot analysis. Survival curves for lung cancer patients were prepared with the Kaplan-Meier method. Migration and invasion of SCARA3 overexpressed lung cancer cells were determined using a Transwell chamber system. Proliferation of lung cancer cells was determined based on cell viability assay using cell culture in vitro and a tumorigenicity model of BALB/C nude mouse in vivo.  Results:   The expression of SCARA3 was abnormally reduced in TCGA-database, lung tissue microarray, and various lung cancer cells. However, overexpression of SCARA3 reduced the proliferation of lung cancer. The ability of SCARA3 to inhibit cancer cell proliferation was maintained even in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. In addition, overexpression of SCARA3 reduced migration and invasion ability of lung cancer cells and induced decreases of EMT markers such as β-catenin, vimentin, and MMP9. We aimed to prove the role of SCARA3 in the treatment of Lung cancer, and shown that the expression level of SCARA3 is important in cancer treatment using cisplatin. The enhancement of the effect of cisplatin according to SCARA3 overexpression is via the AKT and JNK pathways.  Conclusions:   This study confirmed an abnormal decrease in SCARA3 in lung cancer. Overexpression of SCARA3 potently inhibited tumors in lung cancer and induced apoptosis by increasing sensitivity of lung cancer to cisplatin. These results suggest that SCARA3 is a major biomarker of lung cancer and that the induction of SCARA3 overexpression can indicate an effective treatment.""","""['Jeeho Kim', 'Ho Jin You', 'Chakyung Youn']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['FAM83D promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion and cisplatin resistance through regulating the AKT/mTOR pathway in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'MTA1 promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'WSTF promotes proliferation and invasion of lung cancer cells by inducing EMT via PI3K/Akt and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways.', '14, 15-EET induces breast cancer cell EMT and cisplatin resistance by up-regulating integrin αvβ3 and activating FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'Nimotuzumab inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer by targeting the Akt/YB-1/AR axis.', 'Space Environment Impacts Homeostasis: Exposure to Spaceflight Alters Mammary Gland Transportome Genes.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) to detect residual PCa in the short-term follow-up of focal treatment with irreversible electroporation (IRE) using transperineal or transrectal template ± targeted biopsies.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective international multicenter study of men with biopsy-proven PCa, treated with focal IRE, and followed by mpMRI (index-test) and template biopsies (reference-test) between February 2013 and January 2021, was conducted.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of mpMRI were calculated for in- and outfield residual disease based on two definitions of significant PCa: University College London (UCL) 1-International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) ≥3 or ISUP ≥1 with maximum cancer core length (MCCL) ≥6 mm, and UCL2-ISUP ≥2 or ISUP ≥1 with MCCL ≥4 mm.  Results and limitations:   A total of 303 patients from five focal therapy centers were treated with primary IRE. The final analysis was performed on 217 men (median age 67, median prostate-specific antigen 6.2, 81% ISUP 2/3) who underwent both mpMRI and template biopsies. Multiparametric MRI missed 38/57 (67%) positive biopsy locations (UCL1) in 22 patients. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of mpMRI to detect whole gland residual disease (UCL1) were 43.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 28-59), 80.9% (95% CI: 75-86), 33.3% (95% CI: 21-47), and 86.7% (95% CI: 81-91), respectively.

Limitations are the retrospective nature and short follow-up.  Conclusions:   The diagnostic accuracy of mpMRI to detect residual clinically significant PCa following IRE was low. Follow-up template biopsies should be performed, regardless of mpMRI results.

Indeed, the continuous development of heavy-ion cancer therapy requires modelling of biological effects of ion beams on tumours and normal tissues. The relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of heavy ions is higher than that of protons, with a significant variation along the beam path. Therefore, it requires a precise modelling, especially for the pencil-beam scanning technique. Currently, two radiobiological models, LEM I and MKM, are in use for heavy ions in scanned pencil-beam facilities.Approach.Utilizing an interface with the FLUKA Particle Therapy Tool, BIANCA was applied to re-calculate the RBE-weighted dose distribution for carbon-ion treatment of three patients (chordoma, head-and-neck and prostate) previously irradiated at CNAO, where radiobiological optimization was based on LEM I. The predictions obtained by BIANCA were based either on chordoma cell survival (RBEsurv), or on dicentric aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes (RBEab), which are indicators of late normal tissue damage, including secondary tumours. The simulation outcomes were then compared with those provided by LEM I.Main results.While in the target and in the entrance channel BIANCA predictions were lower than those obtained by LEM I, the two models provided very similar results in the considered OAR. The observed differences betweenRBEsurvandRBEab(which were also dependent on fractional dose and LET) suggest that in normal tissues the information on cell survival should be integrated by information more closely related to the induction of late damage, such as chromosome aberrations.Significance.This work showed that BIANCA is suitable for treatment plan optimization in ion-beam therapy, especially considering that it can predict both cell survival and chromosome aberrations and has previously shown good agreement with carbon-ion experimental data.""","""['Wioletta S Kozłowska', 'Mario P Carante', 'Giulia Aricò', 'Alessia Embriaco', 'Alfredo Ferrari', 'Giuseppe Magro', 'Andrea Mairani', 'Ricardo Ramos', 'Paola Sala', 'Dietmar Georg', 'Francesca Ballarini']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['In Vivo Validation of the BIANCA Biophysical Model: Benchmarking against Rat Spinal Cord RBE Data.', 'Healthy Tissue Damage Following Cancer Ion Therapy: A Radiobiological Database Predicting Lymphocyte Chromosome Aberrations Based on the BIANCA Biophysical Model.', 'Radiobiological damage by space radiation: extension of the BIANCA model to heavy ions up to iron, and pilot application to cosmic ray exposure.', 'A comparison of mechanism-inspired models for particle relative biological effectiveness (RBE).', ""Creation, evolution, and future challenges of ion beam therapy from a medical physicist's viewpoint (Part 2).

We examine several isolation procedures, exosome storage conditions and other conditions affecting exosome production by prostate cell lines. We selected four different commercially available kits based on different principles to achieve exosome isolation, the best being magnetic-based. In addition, we found storage at - 20 °C to be good for storing isolated exosomes and that exosomes were produced from the cancerous prostate cell line 22Rv1 in much greater amounts than the non-cancerous prostate cell line RWPE1. We also found differences in the response of both cell lines in the production of exosomes as a result of stress, i.e. exposure to hydrogen peroxide and starvation. The effect of Triton X-100 on exosome lysis was examined using two different surfactant concentrations by analysis of the exosome count and change in the exosome size. The final part of the article details the advantages of the use of a 2D biochip prepared in-house over a commercially available 3D biochip for monitoring the interaction of exosomes via its surface receptors (CD63) with an immobilised ligand (anti-CD63 antibodies) using surface plasmon resonance.

Methods:   Baseline (n = 991) and 6 month follow-up data (n = 777) were collected among breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors from 32 US cancer centers. Participants completed surveys on healthcare utilization (e.g., number of visits to specific providers) and delay of medical care. We categorized participants as high or low users based on median number of visits. We used logistic regression models to examine factors that predicted high healthcare utilization or delay.  Results:   Survivors reported a median of 10.5 visits to healthcare providers and 28% reported ever delaying medical care over 6 months. Compared to prostate cancer survivors, breast and colorectal survivors were 2.4 times more likely (CI = 1.2-4.8) and 4 times more likely (CI = 2.2-7.3) to be high healthcare users, respectively.

The association between the Grade D recommendation and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) among contemporary cohorts, however, is unclear.  Objective:   To evaluate PCSM rates between 1999 and 2019, comparing trends in rates before and after the change in the 2012 USPSTF screening guideline to assess its association with PCSM.  Exposure:   The 2012 USPSTF Grade D recommendation against PSA screening for all men.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics to collect data on cause of death for all individuals who died of prostate cancer in the US from 1999 to 2019. Analysis was performed from January to August 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Trends in PCSM rates were calculated from 1999 to 2012 and from 2014 to 2019, with a washout year of 2013, using linear regression, with year and binary indicator of pre-2013 and post-2013 status as interaction terms. Trends were further analyzed by age, race and ethnicity, urbanization category, and US Census region. Other measures included diagnosis of localized or metastatic prostate cancer and overall cancer mortality.  Results:   A total of 618 095 patients died of prostate cancer in the US from 1999 to 2019. Age-adjusted PCSM decreased linearly at a rate of -0.273 per 100 000 population per year from 1999 to 2012 and stalled at a rate of -0.009 per 100 000 per year from 2014 to 2019 (P < .001). This finding was significant among men aged 60 years or older, especially among men aged 60 to 69 years, men aged 80 years or older, and among Black men. Men aged 60 to 64 years had a decreasing, age-adjusted PCSM rate of -0.0088 per 100 000 population per year prior to 2013 followed by an increasing rate of 0.0014 per 100 000 per year. Men aged 65 to 69 years had a decreasing, age-adjusted PCSM rate of -0.024 per 100 000 population per year prior to 2013 followed by an increasing rate of 0.0011 per 100 000 population per year. Men aged 80 years or older had the largest absolute difference between rates before and after 2013 compared with all other age groups, with a difference of 0.06 for men aged 80 to 84 years and 0.07 for men 85 aged years or older. Black men had a decreasing, age-adjusted PCSM rate of -0.700 per 100 000 population per year prior to 2013 followed by a flattened rate of -0.091 per 100 000 population per year. Changes were observed across races and ethnicities, urbanization categories, and US Census regions and were accompanied by increased diagnoses of metastatic disease, which are inconsistent with mortality trends across all malignant neoplasms.  Conclusions and relevance:   This cross-sectional study using comprehensive PCSM data through 2019 demonstrated decreasing PCSM rates that flattened or increased after the 2012 USPSTF Grade D recommendation, suggesting that decreased PSA screening may be a factor associated with this change. This change was seen across ages, races and ethnicities, urbanization categories, and US Census regions. The updated 2018 USPSTF guideline supporting shared decision-making may reverse these trends in the coming years.""","""['Laura Burgess', 'Christopher M Aldrighetti', 'Anushka Ghosh', 'Andrzej Niemierko', 'Fumiko Chino', 'Melissa J Huynh', 'Jason A Efstathiou', 'Sophia C Kamran']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Variations in Age-Adjusted Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates by Race and Ethnicity After Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Recommendation.', 'Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing Relative to the Revised US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation on Prostate Cancer Screening.', 'Prostate Cancer Incidence and PSA Testing Patterns in Relation to USPSTF Screening Recommendations.', ""Impact of the United States Preventive Services Task Force 'D' recommendation on prostate cancer screening and staging."", 'The effect of the USPSTF PSA screening recommendation on prostate cancer incidence patterns in the USA.', 'Radiation Facility Volume and Survival for Men With Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radiation and Androgen Deprivation Therapy.', 'Associations of Content and Context of Communication with Prostate-Specific Antigen Testing.', 'Opportunities for Achieving the Cancer Moonshot Goal of a 50% Reduction in Cancer Mortality by 2047.', 'Variations in Age-Adjusted Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates by Race and Ethnicity After Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Recommendation.', 'Response to Takahashi.']"""

We explored direct prostatic effects of add-back FSH, after androgen ablation with GnRH antagonist, permanently suppressing both gonadotropins.  Methods:   The effects of recombinant human (rFSH) were examined in mice treated with vehicle (controls), GnRH antagonist degarelix (dgx), dgx + rFSH, dgx + flutamide, or dgx + rFSH + flutamide for 4 weeks. Prostates and testes size and expression of prostate-specific and/or androgen-responsive genes were measured. Additionally, 33 young men underwent dgx-treatment. Seventeen were supplemented with rFSH (weeks 1-5), and all with testosterone (weeks 4-5). Testosterone, gondotropins, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and inhibin B were measured.  Results:   In dgx and dgx + flutamide treated mice, prostate weight/body weight was 91% lower than in controls, but 41 and 11%, respectively, was regained by rFSH treatment (P = 0.02). The levels of seminal vesicle secretion 6, Pbsn, Nkx3.1, beta-microseminoprotein, and inhibin b were elevated in dgx + rFSH-treated animals compared with only dgx treated (all P < 0.05). In men, serum inhibin B rose after dgx treatment but was subsequently suppressed by testosterone. rFSH add-back had no effect on PSA levels.  Conclusions:   These data provide novel evidence for the direct effects of FSH on prostate size and gene expression in chemically castrated mice. However, in chemically castrated men, FSH had no effect on PSA production.

Recent studies have demonstrated that DKK3 has a variety of functions, suggesting that it plays roles not only in tumorigenesis, but also tumor neovascularization, prostatic acinus formation, cardiac vascular remodeling, renal and cardiac fibrosis, and immunological activity. The function of DKK3 is therefore of great interest, but details of the receptors and mechanisms involved have remained unclear. Here, we focused on the extracellular function of DKK3 as a secreted protein, and identified transforming growth factor beta induced protein ig-h3 (TGFBI) as a secreted protein interacting with DKK3. To investigate the function of these secreted proteins, we employed an in vitro cell model involving human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, human embryonic kidney cells, or non-neoplastic hepatocyte cells. We showed that DKK3 functions as an extracellular matrix-like molecule supporting adhesion, motility, and invasion, and that its interaction with TGFBI inhibits the functions of secreted DKK3 in cells expressing both proteins.

Therefore, there is a great need to develop in vivo model systems to study prostate cancer metastasis and to test potential therapeutics. Most murine prostate cancer metastatic models involve intracardiac or intraosseous implantation of cancer cells, which bypass the early stages of tumor cell migration and invasion. Herein we provide a detailed protocol for a novel method of resecting subcutaneous prostate cancer allografts in immunocompetent mice to produce spontaneous metastases and describe a pilot study using this method of tumor resection. Intact male FVB/NCrl mice (n = 9) were inoculated subcutaneously with Myc-CaP cells. Tumors were surgically resected, and mice were monitored for tumor recurrence. Animals were euthanized or died, and a full set of tissues was collected for histopathologic examination. Tumors took an average of 44 days (range 23-61) to reach 1.7 cm in any direction. All tumors were resectable, and resection of the tumors increased the study length by 70 days (range 30-121). One mouse was euthanized early of an unrelated cause, and of eight remaining mice, four developed tumor recurrence at the site of resection. One mouse developed bone metastases, one mouse developed metastases to the abdominal cavity, and two mice showed signs of local invasion.

Paclitaxel (Taxol) is a widely used anticancer agent. Despite recent improvements in clinical application and research, development of drug resistance limits the efficacy of the Taxol-based chemotherapy. Previous studies revealed that the long noncoding RNA DANCR positively regulated progression of prostate cancer. However, the precise roles of DANCR in the Taxol sensitivity of PCa and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report that the expressions of DANCR were significantly upregulated and miR-33b-5p were downregulated in prostate tumor specimens and cells as well as the Taxol-resistant prostate cancer cell line (PC3-TXR). Silencing DANCR or overexpressing miR-33b-5p effectively enhanced the Taxol sensitivity of PCa cells. Bioinformatics analysis, RNA pull-down assay, and luciferase assay consistently illustrated that DANCR was associated with miR-33b-5p, leading to downregulation of miR-33b-5p in PCa. Interestingly, glucose metabolism of PC3-TXR cells was remarkedly elevated. The glucose uptake, extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), and glycolysis speed-limiting enzyme expressions were significantly promoted in PC3-TXR cells. We further identified the glucose metabolism enzyme; LDHA was a direct target of miR-33b-5p in PCa cells. LDHA restoration attenuated miR-33b-5p-mediated PTX sensitization. Finally, the rescue of miR-33b-5p in DANCR-overexpressing PC3-TXR cells successfully overrode the DANCR-promoted Taxol resistance. In summary, this study uncovered biological roles and molecular mechanisms of the DANCR-promoted chemoresistance, contributing to the development of noncoding RNA-based therapeutic strategies against drug-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Yu-Yong Wang', 'Chao Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['LncRNA-SNHG1 promotes paclitaxel resistance of gastric cancer cells through modulating the miR-216b-5p-hexokianse 2 axis.', 'Knockdown of lncRNA CCAT1 enhances sensitivity of paclitaxel in prostate cancer via regulating miR-24-3p and FSCN1.', 'LncRNA AFAP1-AS1 modulates the sensitivity of paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel via miR-195-5p/FKBP1A axis.', 'miR-33b in human cancer: Mechanistic and clinical perspectives.', 'A review on the role of DANCR in the carcinogenesis.', 'LncRNA GLTC targets LDHA for succinylation and enzymatic activity to promote progression and radioiodine resistance in papillary thyroid cancer.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Oncogenic Long Noncoding RNAs in Prostate Cancer, Osteosarcoma, and Metastasis.', 'SLC25A25-AS1 over-expression could be predicted the dismal prognosis and was related to the immune microenvironment in prostate cancer.']"""

Nevertheless, arsenic trioxide has been used successfully in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Therefore, arsenic might play different roles in the carcinogenesis of solid cancers and hematologic malignancies. The relationship between arsenic in drinking water and the incidences of hematologic malignancies has not been fully investigated. We established a cohort of Taiwanese population and assorted 319 townships of Taiwan into two exposure categories using 0.05 mg/L as the cutoff. Then, we linked these data to the Taiwan Cancer Registry and computed standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of lymphoma and leukemia by sex, exposure category and time period. The trend of changes in the SIRs over time was assessed, from 1981-1990 to 1991-2000 and then to 2001-2010. We found that in both lymphoma and leukemia, the higher exposure category was associated with lower SIRs in both men and women. In terms of time trends, the SIRs in both lymphoma and leukemia showed increasing trends in both sexes, while exposure to arsenic in drinking water decreased over time. The arsenic level in drinking water was negatively associated with the incidences of lymphoma and leukemia in both men and women.

In South Africa, it is ranked as leading cancer among men. This study describes prostate cancer patterns and trends in the rural Eastern Cape Province population.  Methodology:   Secondary data were used from which a sample of 723 prostate cancer (C61) patients was extracted from the database into STATA version 14.0 for descriptive analysis. A direct standardization method was used to estimate age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates. Keyfitz method was used to calculate the standard error and confidence interval, whereas the Joinpoint program the annual percentage change.  Results:   The mean age was 64 years, with a standard deviation of 9.9. Trends in prostate cancer incidence increased significantly (p = 0.026) from 7.4% in 2010 to 12.6% in 2017. Incidence rates varied across the region, with the lowest of 4.5 per 100,000 in 1998 to the highest of 21.4 per 100,000 in 2017 period. Lusikisiki had the highest incidence rates of 53.4 per 100,000 population (95% CI 0.8-61.4), while Centane with 21.7 per 100,000 (95% CI 2.3-27.6) rated the second. Other magisterial areas showed a constant increase (p > 0.05) throughout the observation period except for Idutywa and Willowvale, with no apparent increase.

A three-group randomised trial was designed to determine whether incremental gains in patient outcomes can be achieved by adding either 4-6 months of short-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) to PBRT, or both short-term ADT and pelvic lymph node radiotherapy (PLNRT) to PBRT.  Methods:   The international, multicentre, randomised, controlled SPPORT trial was done at 283 radiation oncology cancer treatment centres in the USA, Canada, and Israel. Eligible patients (aged ≥18 years) were those who after prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate had a persistently detectable or an initially undetectable and rising PSA of between 0·1 and 2·0 ng/mL. Patients with and without lymphadenectomy (N0/Nx) were eligible if there was no clinical or pathological evidence of lymph node involvement. Other eligibility criteria included pT2 or pT3 disease, prostatectomy Gleason score of 9 or less, and a Zubrod performance status of 0-1. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive PBRT alone at a dose of 64·8-70·2 Gy at 1·8 Gy per fraction daily (group 1), PBRT plus short-term ADT (group 2), or PLNRT (45 Gy at 1·8 Gy per fraction, and then a volume reduction made to the planning target volume for the remaining 19·8-25 ·2 Gy) plus PBRT plus short-term ADT (group 3). The primary endpoint was freedom from progression, in which progression was defined as biochemical failure according to the Phoenix definition (PSA ≥2 ng/mL over the nadir PSA), clinical failure (local, regional, or distant), or death from any cause. A planned interim analysis of 1191 patents with minimum potential follow-up time of 5 years applied a Haybittle-Peto boundary of p<0·001 (one sided) for comparison of 5-year freedom from progression rates between the treatment groups. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00567580. The primary objectives of the trial have been completed, although long-term follow-up is continuing.  Findings:   Between March 31, 2008, and March 30, 2015, 1792 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the three treatment groups (592 to group 1 [PBRT alone], 602 to group 2 [PBRT plus short-term ADT], and 598 to group 3 [PLNRT plus PBRT plus short-term ADT]). 76 patients subsequently found to be ineligible were excluded from the analyses; thus, the evaluable patient population comprised 1716 patients. At the interim analysis (n=1191 patients; data cutoff May 23, 2018), the Haybittle-Peto boundary for 5-year freedom from progression was exceeded when group 1 was compared with group 3 (difference 17·9%, SE 2·9%; p<0·0001). The difference between groups 2 and 3 did not exceed the boundary (p=0·0063). With additional follow-up beyond the interim analysis (the final planned analysis; data cutoff May 26, 2021), at a median follow-up among survivors of 8·2 years (IQR 6·6-9·4), the 5-year freedom from progression rates in all 1716 eligible patients were 70·9% (95% CI 67·0-74·9) in group 1, 81·3% (78·0-84·6) in group 2, and 87·4% (84·7-90·2) in group 3. Per protocol criteria, freedom from progression in group 3 was superior to groups 1 and 2. Acute (≤3 months after radiotherapy) grade 2 or worse adverse events were significantly more common in group 3 (246 [44%] of 563 patients) than in group 2 (201 [36%] of 563; p=0·0034), which, in turn, were more common than in group 1 (98 [18%] of 547; p<0·0001). Similar findings were observed for grade 3 or worse adverse events. However, late toxicity (>3 months after radiotherapy) did not differ significantly between the groups, apart from more late grade 2 or worse blood or bone marrow events in group 3 versus group 2 (one-sided p=0·0060) attributable to the addition of PLNRT in this group.  Interpretation:   The results of this randomised trial establish the benefit of adding short-term ADT to PBRT to prevent progression in prostate cancer. To our knowledge, these are the first such findings to show that extending salvage radiotherapy to treat the pelvic lymph nodes when combined with short-term ADT results in meaningful reductions in progression after prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer.

In treatment-naïve primary PCa, recent work correlated intratumoral plasma cell content with enhanced tumor immune-responsiveness. We sought to identify features of localized PCa at a high risk of recurrence following local treatment with high plasma cell content to help focus future immune-based neoadjuvant trials.  Methods:   We performed retrospective analyses of molecular profiles from three independent cohorts of over 1300 prostate tumors. We used Wilcoxon Rank Sum to compare molecular pathways between tumors with high and low intratumoral plasma cell content and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses to assess metastasis-free survival.  Results:   We validated an expression-based signature for intratumoral plasma cell content in 113 primary prostate tumors with both RNA-expression data and digital image quantification of CD138+ cells (plasma cell marker) based on immunohistochemisty. The signature showed castration-resistant tumors (n = 101) with more prior systemic therapies contained lower plasma cell content. In high-grade primary PCa, tumors with high plasma cell content were associated with increased predicted response to immunotherapy and decreased response to androgen-deprivation therapy. Master regulator analyses identified upregulated transcription factors implicated in immune (e.g. SKAP1, IL-16, and HCLS1), and B-cell activity (e.g. VAV1, SP140, and FLI-1) in plasma cell-high tumors. Master regulators overactivated in tumors with low plasma cell content were associated with shorter metastasis-free survival following radical prostatectomy.

The novel method displays a sensitivity of 96.80%, a specificity of 99.96% and an overall accuracy of 99.89%, compared to current standards.

Mutations in ACVR2A (73%), KMT2D (68%), KMT2B (66%) and MMR-related genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) were enriched in MSI-H samples. Furthermore, MSI-H samples were more likely to have high TMB (P < .01), high PD-L1 expression (P < .05) and more tumor-infiltrating immune cells than microsatellite-stable (MSS) samples. Compared to the TCGA patients, the prevalence of MSI-H in the Chinese cohort was significantly lower in colorectal, gastric and pancreatic cancer, while significantly higher in urinary and prostate cancer. Mutations in ACVR2A (73% vs 28%, P < .01) and MMR-related genes (51.4% vs 21.3%, P < .01) were significantly higher in the Chinese population.

Mass drug administration is currently the most important control measure, but the use of the few available drugs is giving rise to increased resistance of the parasites to the drugs. Different approaches are needed to come up with new therapeutic agents against these helminths. Fungi are a source of secondary metabolites, but most fungi remain largely uninvestigated as anthelmintics. In this report, the anthelmintic activity of Albatrellus confluens against Caenorhabditis elegans was investigated using bio-assay guided isolation. Grifolin (1) and neogrifolin (2) were identified as responsible for the anthelmintic activity. Derivatives 4-6 were synthesized to investigate the effect of varying the prenyl chain length on anthelmintic activity. The isolated compounds 1 and 2 and synthetic derivatives 4-6, as well as their educts 7-10, were tested against Schistosoma mansoni (adult and newly transformed schistosomula), Strongyloides ratti, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Necator americanus, and Ancylostoma ceylanicum.

Surgery is the most effective treatment for PCa. Precise targeting of tumors during surgery can reduce the incidence of positive surgical margins (PSMs) and preserve the neurovascular bundles (NVBs) as much as possible. The objective of this study was to synthesize a PSMA fluorescent probe (PSMA-Cy5) and verify the targeting specificity of the probe for prostate cancer, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the development of PSMA fluorescent probes for clinical application in the future. Methods: In this study, a novel water-soluble 3H-indocyanine-type bioluminescent dye-Cy5-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand (PSMA-Cy5) was synthesized by liquid phase synthesis. The PSMA ligand was developed based on the glutamine-urea-lysine (Glu-urea-Lys) structure. The new fluorescent probe was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, and its safety was evaluated. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the binding uptake of PSMA-Cy5 with PSMA (+) LNCaP cells, PSMA (-) PC3 cells and blocked LNCaP cells. In in vivo optical imaging studies, the targeting specificity of PSMA (+) 22Rv1 tumors to probe binding was validated by tail vein injection of PSMA-Cy5. The safety of the PSMA-Cy5 probe was evaluated by histopathological analysis of mouse organs by a single high-dose tail vein injection of PSMA-Cy5. Results: In vitro fluorescence cell uptake experiments showed that the binding of PSMA-Cy5 to LNCaP cells has targeting specificity. PC3 cells and blocked LNCaP cells showed almost no uptake. The results of in vivo optical imaging studies showed that the tumor-to-background ratio in the 22Rv1 group was 3.39 ± 0.47; in the 22Rv1 blocking group it was 0.78 ± 0.15, and in the PC3 group it was 0.94 ± 0.09, consistent with the in vitro results. After a high-dose injection of PSMA-Cy5, there were no abnormalities in the tissues or organs of the mice. The probe showed good safety. Conclusions: PSMA-Cy5 is a probe with good targeting specificity and low toxicity that can accurately visualize tumors in vivo. This study has an important reference value for the development of PSMA fluorescent probes. In the future, it can be applied to precise tumor imaging during radical prostatectomy to reduce the incidence of postoperative PSM.""","""['Haoxi Zhou', 'Yachao Liu', 'Xiaojun Zhang', 'Kuang Chen', 'Yuan Li', 'Xiaodan Xu', 'Baixuan Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Targeted fluorescent imaging of a novel FITC-labeled PSMA ligand in prostate cancer.', 'Dual-Modality ImmunoPET/Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer with an Anti-PSCA Cys-Minibody.', 'PSMA-targeted NIR probes for image-guided detection of prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Nanomedicines to Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Specificity of Ligands to Two Different Receptors In Vivo.', 'Inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen in the diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer - a review of patent literature.']"""

Activation of erythrophoyetin-producing human hepatocellular (Eph) receptors has been implicated in cancer. Eph receptor interactions with Ephrin ligands lead to bidirectional signals in the recipient and effector cells. The consequences of continuous reverse Ephrin signaling activation in fibroblasts on prostate cancer (PCa) is unknown. When compared to benign prostate fibroblast, CAF displayed higher expression of Ephrin B1, B2, and B3 ligands (EFNB1, EFNB2, and EFNB3). In this study, we found that continuous activation of EFNB1 and EFNB3 in a benign human prostate stromal cell line (BHPrS1) increased the expression of CAF markers and induced a CAF phenotype. BHPrS1EFNB1 and BHPrS1EFNB3 displayed a pro-tumorigenic secretome with multiple effects on neovascularization, collagen deposition, and cancer cell proliferation, overall increasing tumorigenicity of a premalignant prostate epithelial cell line BPH1 and PCa cell line LNCaP, both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Src family kinases (SFK) in BHPrS1EFNB1 and BHPrS1EFNB3 suppressed EFNB-induced ɑ-SMA (Alpha-smooth muscle actin) and TN-C (Tenascin-C) in vitro.

Here, we identified the metabolic genes fueling the seeding of PCa in the bone niche. Using a transwell co-culture system of PCa (PC3) and bone progenitor cells (MC3T3 or Raw264.7), we assessed the transcriptome of PC3 cells modulated by soluble factors released from bone precursors. In a Principal Component Analysis using transcriptomic data from human PCa samples (GSE74685), the altered metabolic genes found in vitro were able to stratify PCa patients in two defined groups: primary PCa and bone metastasis, confirmed by an unsupervised clustering analysis. Thus, the early transcriptional metabolic profile triggered in the in vitro model has a clinical correlate in human bone metastatic samples. Further, the expression levels of five metabolic genes (VDR, PPARA, SLC16A1, GPX1 and PAPSS2) were independent risk-predictors of death in the SU2C-PCF dataset and a risk score model built using this lipid-associated signature was able to discriminate a subgroup of bone metastatic PCa patients with a 23-fold higher risk of death. This signature was validated in a PDX pre-clinical model when comparing MDA-PCa-183 growing intrafemorally vs. subcutaneously, and appears to be under the regulatory control of the Protein Kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. Secretome analyses of conditioned media showcased fibronectin and type-1 collagen as critical bone-secreted factors that could regulate tumoral PKA.

Most of these methods require ""direct characterization"" of the PC., i.e., they necessitate protein isolation, identification, and quantification. Each of these steps can introduce bias and affect reproducibility and inter-laboratory consistency of experimental data. To fulfill this gap, here we develop a nanoparticle-enabled blood (NEB) test based on the indirect characterization of the personalized PC by magnetic levitation (MagLev). The MagLev NEB test works by analyzing the levitation profiles of PC-coated graphene oxide (GO) NPs that migrate along a magnetic field gradient in a paramagnetic medium. For the test validation, we employed human plasma samples from 15 healthy individuals and 30 oncological patients affected by four cancer types, namely breast cancer, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Over the last 15 years prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and PDAC have continuously been the second, third, and fourth leading sites of cancer-related deaths in men, while breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and PDAC are the second, third and fourth leading sites for women. This proof-of-concept investigation shows that the sensitivity and specificity of the MagLev NEB test depend on the cancer type, with the global classification accuracy ranging from 70% for prostate cancer to an impressive 93.3% for PDAC. We also discuss how this tool could benefit from several tunable parameters (e.g., the intensity of magnetic field gradient, NP type, exposure conditions, etc.) that can be modulated to optimize the detection of different cancer types with high sensitivity and specificity.""","""['Erica Quagliarini', 'Luca Digiacomo', 'Damiano Caputo', 'Alessandro Coppola', 'Heinz Amenitsch', 'Giulio Caracciolo', 'Daniela Pozzi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nanomaterials (Basel)""","""['Nanotechnology Meets Oncology: A Perspective on the Role of the Personalized Nanoparticle-Protein Corona in the Development of Technologies for Pancreatic Cancer Detection.', 'Magnetic Levitation Patterns of Microfluidic-Generated Nanoparticle-Protein Complexes.', 'Detection of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma by Ex Vivo Magnetic Levitation of Plasma Protein-Coated Nanoparticles.', 'Multiplexed Detection of Pancreatic Cancer by Combining a Nanoparticle-Enabled Blood Test and Plasma Levels of Acute-Phase Proteins.', 'Nanoparticle-enabled blood tests for early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'A Magnetic Levitation System for Range/Sensitivity-Tunable Measurement of Density.', 'Nanotechnology Meets Oncology: A Perspective on the Role of the Personalized Nanoparticle-Protein Corona in the Development of Technologies for Pancreatic Cancer Detection.', 'Magnetic Levitation Patterns of Microfluidic-Generated Nanoparticle-Protein Complexes.']"""

Therefore, ADT-induced dormancy is a unique time window for treatment that can provide a cure. The study of this well-recognized phase of prostate cancer progression is largely hindered by the scarcity of appropriate clinical tissue and clinically relevant preclinical models. Here, we report the utility of unique and clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft models in the study of the intrinsic immune landscape of dormant PCa.

PCa cells were found to exhibit increased AuNP uptake when compared to non-tumoral ones, leading to a significant loss of cellular proliferation ability and complex DNA damage, evidenced by the occurrence of multiple micronucleus per binucleated cell, in the case of PC3 cells irradiated with 2 Gy of γ-rays, after incubation with AuNP-BBN. Remarkably, the treatment of the PC3 cells with AuNP-BBN led to a much stronger influence of the dose rate on the cellular survival upon γ-photon irradiation, as well as on their genomic instability.

Androgen deprivation therapy is the first line treatment but, unfortunately, a large part of patients evolves to a castration-resistant stage, for which no effective cure is currently available. The DNA/RNA helicase DHX9 is emerging as an important regulator of cellular processes that are often deregulated in cancer.  Methods:   To investigate whether DHX9 modulates PC cell transcriptome we performed RNA-sequencing analyses upon DHX9 silencing in the androgen-responsive cell line LNCaP. Bioinformatics and functional analyses were carried out to elucidate the mechanism of gene expression regulation by DHX9. Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas were mined to evaluate the potential role of DHX9 in PC.  Results:   We found that up-regulation of DHX9 correlates with advanced stage and is associated with poor prognosis of PC patients. High-throughput RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that depletion of DHX9 in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells affects expression of hundreds of genes, which significantly overlap with known targets of the Androgen Receptor (AR). Notably, AR binds to the DHX9 promoter and induces its expression, while Enzalutamide-mediated inhibition of AR activity represses DHX9 expression. Moreover, DHX9 interacts with AR in LNCaP cells and its depletion significantly reduced the recruitment of AR to the promoter region of target genes and the ability of AR to promote their expression in response to 5α-dihydrotestosterone. Consistently, silencing of DXH9 negatively affected androgen-induced PC cell proliferation and migration.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our data uncover a new role of DHX9 in the control of the AR transcriptional program and establish the existence of an oncogenic DHX9/AR axis, which may represent a new druggable target to counteract PC progression.""","""['Lidia Chellini', 'Marco Pieraccioli', 'Claudio Sette', 'Maria Paola Paronetto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Src promotes castration-recurrent prostate cancer through androgen receptor-dependent canonical and non-canonical transcriptional signatures.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'Identification of novel genes that regulate androgen receptor signaling and growth of androgen-deprived prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A pan-cancer analysis of the expression and molecular mechanism of DHX9 in human cancers.', 'Synthetic lethal interactions of DEAD/H-box helicases as targets for cancer therapy.', 'The enigmatic helicase DHX9 as a candidate prognostic biomarker for resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.']"""

In most normal tissues, expression of TUBB4A is little to none, but it is highly expressed in human prostate cancer. Here we show that high expression levels of TUBB4A are associated with aggressive prostate cancers and poor patient survival, especially for African-American men. Additionally, in prostate cancer cells, TUBB4A knockout (KO) reduces cell growth and migration but induces DNA damage through increased γH2AX and 53BP1. Furthermore, during constricted cell migration, TUBB4A interacts with MYH9 to protect the nucleus, but either TUBB4A KO or MYH9 knockdown leads to severe DNA damage and reduces the NF-κB signaling response. Also, TUBB4A KO retards tumor growth and metastasis. Functional analysis reveals that TUBB4A/GSK3β binds to the N-terminal of MYH9, and that TUBB4A KO reduces MYH9-mediated GSK3β ubiquitination and degradation, leading to decreased activation of β-catenin signaling and its relevant epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Likewise, prostate-specific deletion of Tubb4a reduces spontaneous tumor growth and metastasis via inhibition of NF-κB, cyclin D1, and c-MYC signaling activation.

Transperineal permanent brachytherapy of prostate cancer is the interstitial implantation of low-dose rate radioactive seeds into the prostate gland for the purpose of treating localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   This practice parameter was developed according to the process described under the heading The Process for Developing ACR Practice Parameters and Technical Standards on the ACR website (https://www.acr.org/Clinical-Resources/Practice-Parameters-and-Technical-Standards) by the Committee on Practice Parameters-Radiation Oncology of the Commission on Radiation Oncology, in collaboration with ABS and ASTRO.  Results:   This practice parameter provides a framework for the appropriate use of low-dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer either as monotherapy or as part of a treatment regimen combined with external-beam radiation therapy. The practice parameter defines the qualifications and responsibilities of all involved radiation oncology personnel, including the radiation oncologist, medical physicist, dosimetrist, radiation therapist, and nursing staff. Patient selection criteria and the utilization of supplemental therapies such as external-beam radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy are discussed. The logistics of the implant procedure, postimplant dosimetry assessment, and best practices with regard to safety and quality control are presented.

This study presents an economic evaluation performed alongside an ongoing clinical trial.  Aim:   To investigate up to 6 years' follow-up whether conventional fractionation (CF, 78.0 Gy in 39 fractions, 5 days per week for 8 weeks) is more cost-effective than UHF (42.7 Gy in 7 fractions, 3 days per week for 2.5 weeks inclusive of 2 weekends) radiotherapy in treatment for patients with intermediate-to-high-risk PC.  Method:   HYPO-RT-PC trial is an open-label, randomized, multicenter (10 in Sweden; 2 in Denmark) phase-3 trial. Patients from Sweden (CF 434; UHF 445) were included in this study. The trial database was linked to the National Patient Registry (NPR). Costs for inpatient/non-primary outpatient care for each episode were retrieved. For calculating Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire was mapped to the EQ-5D-3L index. Multivariable regression analyses were used to compare the difference in costs and QALYs, adjusting for age and baseline costs, and health status. The confidence interval for the difference in costs, QALYs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated by the bootstrap percentile method.  Results:   No significant differences were found in ICER between the two arms after 6 years of follow-up.

Furthermore, little is known about rural-urban differences in survival trends by racial and ethnic groups.  Objective:   To examine national rural-urban trends in 5-year cancer-specific survival probabilities for lung, prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers in a diverse sample of racial and ethnic groups.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study used an epidemiologic assessment with 1975 to 2016 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data to analyze patients diagnosed no later than 2011. Patients were classified as living in rural and urban counties based on the 2013 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes.  Main outcomes and measures:   The 5-year cancer-specific survival probability of urban and rural patients for each cancer type was estimated by fitting Cox proportional hazard regression models accounting for race, ethnicity, tumor characteristics, and other sociodemographic characteristics. A generalized linear regression model was used to estimate the mean estimated probability of survival for each stratum. Joinpoint regression analysis estimated periods of significant change in survival.  Results:   In this study, data from 3 659 417 patients with cancer (median [IQR] age, 67 [58-76]; 1 918 609 [52.4%] male; 237 815 [6.5%] Hispanic patients; 396 790 [10.8%] Black patients; 2 825 037 [77.2%] White patients) were analyzed, including 888 338 patients with lung cancer (24.3%), 750 704 patients with colorectal cancer (20.5%), 987 826 patients with breast cancer (27.0%) breast, and 1 023 549 patients with prostate cancer (28.0%). There were 430 353 rural patients (11.8%). Overall, there was an equal representation of rural and urban men. Rural patients were likely to be non-Hispanic White individuals, have more cases of distant tumors, and be older. Rural and non-Hispanic Black patients for all cancer types often had shorter survival. From 1975 to 2016, the 5-year lung cancer survival rate was shorter for non-Hispanic Black rural patients in 1975 at 48%, while increasing to 57% for both non-Hispanic Black urban and rural patients in 2011, but still the shortest among all cancer types. In 1975, the longest survival rate was observed in urban Asian and Pacific Islander patients with breast cancer at 86%, and in 2011, the longest survival rate was observed in urban non-Hispanic White patients with XX cancer at 92%.  Conclusions and relevance:   Even after accounting for sociodemographic and tumor characteristics, these findings suggest that non-Hispanic Black patients with cancer are particularly vulnerable to cancer burden, and resources are urgently needed to reverse decades-old survival trends.""","""['Marquita W Lewis-Thames', 'Marvin E Langston', 'Saira Khan', 'Yunan Han', 'Lindsay Fuzzell', 'Shuai Xu', 'Justin Xavier Moore']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Errors in Author Contributions and Abstract.', 'Where Have We Been With Rural-Urban Cancer Care Disparities and Where Are We Headed?', 'Exploring the intersectionality of race/ethnicity with rurality on breast cancer outcomes: SEER analysis, 2000-2016.', 'Variation in Breast Cancer Subtype Incidence and Distribution by Race/Ethnicity in the United States From 2010 to 2015.', 'Incidence Trends of Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes by Age and Race/Ethnicity in the US From 2010 to 2016.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Cancer Survival: The Contribution of Tumor, Sociodemographic, Institutional, and Neighborhood Characteristics.', 'Differences in breast cancer stage at diagnosis and cancer-specific survival by race and ethnicity in the United States.', 'Urban and Rural Surgical Practice Patterns for Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma.', 'Exploring the intersectionality of race/ethnicity with rurality on breast cancer outcomes: SEER analysis, 2000-2016.', 'Errors in Author Contributions and Abstract.']"""

However, studies to date have had conflicting results regarding the association with prostate cancer mortality (PCM).  Objective:   To evaluate the association of treatment with 5-ARIs with PCM in men without a prior diagnosis of PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   This population-based cohort study was conducted in Stockholm, Sweden, between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2018, and included 429 977 men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test within the study period. Study entry was set to 1 year after the first PSA test. Data were analyzed from September 2021 to December 2021.  Exposures:   After their initial PSA test, men with 2 or more newly dispensed prescriptions of 5-ARI, finasteride, or dutasteride were considered 5-ARI users (n = 26 190).  Main outcomes and measures:   Primary outcome was PCM. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for all-cause mortality and PCM.  Results:   The study cohort included 349 152 men. The median (IQR) age for those with 2 or more filled prescriptions of 5-ARI was 66 (61-73) years and 57 (50-64) years for those without. The median follow-up time was 8.2 (IQR, 4.9-10) years with 2 257 619 person-years for the unexposed group and 124 008 person-years for the exposed group. The median exposure to treatment with 5-ARI was 4.5 (IQR, 2.1-7.4) years. During follow-up, 35 767 men (8.3%) died, with 852 deaths associated with PCa. The adjusted multivariable survival analysis showed a lower risk of PCM in the 5-ARI group with longer exposure times (0.1-2.0 years: adjusted HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.64-1.25; >8 years: adjusted HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.74). No statistically significant differences were seen in all-cause mortality between the exposed and unexposed group. Men treated with 5-ARIs underwent more PSA tests and biopsies per year than the unexposed group (median of 0.63 vs 0.33 and 0.22 vs 0.12, respectively).  Conclusions and relevance:   The results of this cohort study suggest that there was no association between treatment with 5-ARI and increased PCM in a large population-based cohort of men without a previous PCa diagnosis. Additionally, a time-dependent association was seen with decreased risk of PCM with longer 5-ARI treatment. Further research is needed to determine whether the differences are because of intrinsic drug effects or PCa testing differences.""","""['Lars Björnebo', 'Tobias Nordström', 'Andrea Discacciati', 'Thorgerdur Palsdottir', 'Markus Aly', 'Henrik Grönberg', 'Martin Eklund', 'Anna Lantz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Oncol""","""['Errors in Author Affiliations and Figure 2.', 'Error in Figure 2.', 'Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Association of 5α-Reductase Inhibitor Prescription With Bladder Cancer Progression in Males in South Korea.', 'Association of Treatment With 5α-Reductase Inhibitors With Time to Diagnosis and Mortality in Prostate Cancer.', 'Effect of treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitors on progression in monitored men with favourable-risk prostate cancer.', '5α-Reductase Inhibitors and the Risk of Cancer-Related Mortality in Men With Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer detection and dutasteride: utility and limitations of prostate-specific antigen in men with previous negative biopsies.', 'Association of 5α-Reductase Inhibitor Prescription With Bladder Cancer Progression in Males in South Korea.', 'Association Between 5α-Reductase Inhibitors and Prostate Cancer Mortality: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'A Liquid-Liquid Phase Separation-Related Index Associate with Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Immune Environment of Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Risk of prostate cancer and death after benign transurethral resection of the prostate-A 20-year population-based analysis.', 'Errors in Author Affiliations and Figure 2.']"""

(Amaryllidaceae) has been used in Southeast Asian traditional medicine to alleviate the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The pathological mechanism of BPH is associated with the induction of prostate stromal cell proliferation through transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β). Standardization as well as investigation of the potential anti-BPH activity of C. latifolium extract could benefit the further development of BPH-related analyses and provide evidence to support the application of this extract for BPH treatment. This study aimed to standardize and investigate the antiproliferative activity of the ethanolic extract of C. latifolium leaves. The major alkaloids isolated from C. latifolium were also explored for their potential use as bioactive markers.  Methods:   Two major alkaloids were isolated from the ethanolic extract of C. latifolium leaves by chromatographic techniques, identified by NMR and MS, and quantified by a validated UHPLC method. Their antiproliferative activity was studied in human prostate stromal cells (WPMY-1) induced by TGF-β. The synergistic effect of combining the two major isolated alkaloids was analyzed by the zero interaction potency (ZIP) model.  Results:   Two alkaloids, lycorine (1) and 6α-hydroxybuphanidrine (2), were isolated from the ethanolic leaf extract of C. latifolium. A UHPLC method for the quantification of (1) and (2) was developed and validated in terms of linearity, precision, and accuracy. The C. latifolium leaf extract contained 0.279 ± 0.003% (1) and 0.232 ± 0.004% (2). The crude extract was more potent than either (1) and (2) alone against TGF-β-treated WPMY-1 cell proliferation. The drug combination study revealed that the greatest synergistic effect of (1) and (2) was achieved at a 1:1 ratio.  Conclusions:   The results of this study support the anti-BPH activity of C. latifolium in traditional medicine and suggest that these the two isolated alkaloids may promote the efficacy of the C. latifolium extract.

Finally, a hierarchical multiple linear regression analysis with interaction terms was conducted to examine the associations between masculine self-esteem, depression, resilience, and demoralization.  Results:   Depression scores increased linearly with demoralization severity, but demoralization scores were higher than depression scores (21.3% vs. 15.2%).

This work reports on the inter-observer evaluation of the gMCO algorithm into the clinical workflow.  Methods and materials:   Twenty HDR brachytherapy prostate cancer patients were retrospectively replanned with the gMCO algorithm. The reference clinical plans were each generated by experienced physicists using inverse planning followed by graphical optimization and approved by a radiation oncologist (RO). Each case was replanned with the gMCO algorithm by generating 2000 Pareto-optimal plans with four different objective functions. Two physicists were asked to rank the objective functions according to their preferences by choosing one preferred plan for each plans pool and ranking them using gMCO-GUI. The optimized dwell positions and dwell times of the gMCO plans that were ranked first were exported to Oncentra Prostate where a blinded comparison of the gMCO plans with the clinical plans was conducted by three ROs.  Results:   The median planning time of the two physicists was 9 min. Both physicists preferred the objective function with target sub-regions to cover specific target regions. Regarding the blinded comparison, the gMCO plans were preferred 19, 17, and 12 times by the three ROs, in which eight gMCO plans were unanimously preferred compared with the clinical plans.

Enhanced steroidogenesis, mediated by 3βHSD1, is sufficient to impair enzalutamide function. In patients, accelerated abiraterone metabolism results in a decline of plasma abiraterone as disease progresses. BCA inhibits 3βHSD1 and suppresses prostate cancer development alone or together with abiraterone and enzalutamide.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of an industry-led, treatment-integrated, community-based exercise program on outcomes of body weight, cardiovascular health, and physical function.  Patients and methods:   PCa patients with locally advanced, relapsed, or metastatic disease receiving leuprorelin acetate were enrolled across multiple sites in Australia and assigned supervised group exercise undertaken weekly or biweekly (ie, 16 exercise sessions in total) for 10-18 weeks, consisting of aerobic and resistance training performed at moderate-to-vigorous intensity.  Results:   Between 2014 and 2020, 760 participants completed the baseline and follow-up assessment. Participants were age 48-94 years, and most were either overweight (42.1%) or obese (38.1%). Program compliance was high, with 90% of participants completing all 16 exercise sessions.

Methods:   We conducted a mixed methods study with an explanatory-sequential design. Survey findings are presented here. Patients from a Midwestern Cancer Center and the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network (BCAN) self-reported via survey their experience of treatment delay, patient-provider communication, and coping strategies. We quantified patient distress with an ordinal scale (0-10), based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN-DT).  Results:   Forty-four patients with bladder, prostate, and kidney cancers consented to the survey. Most individuals were male (n = 29; 66%) and older than 61 years of age (n = 34; 77%). Median time since diagnosis was 6 months. Dominant reactions to treatment delay included fear that cancer would progress (n = 22; 50%) and relief at avoiding COVID-19 exposure (n = 19; 43%). Most patients reported feeling that their providers acknowledged their emotions (n = 31; 70%), yet 23 patients (52%) did not receive follow-up phone calls and only 24 (55%) felt continually supported by their providers.

We calculated the percentage and distribution of PIDS in prostate DWI and compare the amount of PIDS between mpMRI images obtained with and without an endorectal coil.  Methods:   This IRB approved retrospective study (from 03/03/2014 to 03/10/2020), included 40 patients scanned with endorectal coil (ERC) and 40 without ER coil (NERC). PIDS contains any voxel where: (1) the diffusion signal increases despite an increase in b-value; and/or (2) apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is more than 3.0 μm2/ms (the ADC of pure water at 37 °C and it is physically implausible for any material to have a higher ADC). PIDS for transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) was calculated using an in-house MATLAB program. DWI images were quantitatively inspected for noise, motion, and distortion. T-test was used to compare the difference between PIDS levels in ERC versus NERC and ANOVA to compare the PIDS levels in the anatomic zones. The images were evaluated by a fellowship-trained radiologist in Abdominal Imaging with more than 10 years of experience in reading prostate MRI. This was tested only in prostate in this study.  Results:   80 patients (58 ± 8 years old, 80 men) were evaluated. The percentage of voxels exhibiting PIDS was 17.1 ± 8.1% for the ERC cohort and 22.2 ± 15.5% for the NERC cohort. PIDS for NERC versus ERC were not significantly different (p = 0.14). The apex and base showed similar percentages of PIDS in ERC (p = 0.30) and NERC (p = 0.86). The mid (13.8 ± 8.6%) in ERC showed lower values (p = 0.02) of PIDS compared to apex (19.9 ± 11.1%) and base (17.5 ± 8.3%).  Conclusion:   PIDS maps provide a spatially resolved quantitative quality assessment for prostate DWI. Average PIDS over the entire prostate were similar for the ERC and NERC cohorts, and did not differ significantly across prostate zones.

Methods:   In baseline serum collected more than 30 years before a CRC diagnosis, we quantified concentrations of 15 BAs and 6 SCFAs using targeted liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assays in 1:1 matched cases and controls from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial (men: n = 262 cases; women: n = 233 cases) and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study (men: n = 598 cases). We estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for BA and SCFA quartiles and summary measures with CRC overall and by anatomic location using multivariable conditional logistic regression models. PLCO analyses were stratified by sex. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   In PLCO women, 7 BAs were strongly associated with increased CRC risk, including the secondary BAs, deoxycholic (ORQ4 v Q1 = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.45 to 5.60, Qtrend = 0.011), glycodeoxycholic (OR Q4 v Q1 = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.79 to 6.64, Qtrend = 0.006), taurodeoxycholic (OR Q4 v Q1 = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.22 to 4.55, Qtrend = 0.023), and glycolithocholic acid (ORQ4 v Q1 = 2.71, 95% CI = 1.41 to 5.22, Qtrend = 0.015). Women in the highest compared with lowest quartile of total SCFAs had a 45% lower risk of CRC (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.31 to 0.98, Ptrend = .03). Associations for total BAs and SCFAs were strongest among women with proximal colon cancer. No statistically significant associations were observed for BA or SCFA measures among men.

Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic primarily used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that highly significantly predicts increased olanzapine clearance (rs472660) was previously identified in the CYP3A43 gene, which encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme. But until now there was no experimental evidence for the metabolism of olanzapine by the CYP3A43 enzyme.2. In the present study we provide this evidence, together with a thorough analysis of olanzapine metabolism by all human CYP3A enzymes. We also rationalise our findings by molecular docking experiments. Moreover, we describe the activities of several CYP3A43 mutants and present the first enzymatic activity data for the CYP3A43.3 variant; with respect to prostate cancer, this polymorphic variant is associated with both increased risk and increased mortality. The catalytic properties of the wild type enzyme and the tumour mutant were analysed by molecular dynamics simulations, which fit very well with the observed experimental results.3. Our findings suggest that the SNP rs472660 likely causes an increased CYP3A43 expression level and demonstrate that, depending on the substrate under study, the tumour mutant CYP3A43.3 can have increased activity in comparison to the wild type enzyme CYP3A43.1.""","""['Jie Zhao', 'David Machalz', 'Sijie Liu', 'Clemens Alexander Wolf', 'Gerhard Wolber', 'Maria Kristina Parr', 'Matthias Bureik']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Xenobiotica""","""['Genetic variation in CYP3A43 explains racial difference in olanzapine clearance.', 'Genetic variation in CYP3A43 is associated with response to antipsychotic medication.', 'No influence of CYP3A43 rs472660G> A on steady-state serum olanzapine concentrations in white psychiatric patients.', 'cDNA cloning and initial characterization of CYP3A43, a novel human cytochrome P450.', 'Antipsychotics in bipolar disorders.', 'Changes in Alprazolam Metabolism by CYP3A43 Mutants.']"""

The main idea is to model the irregularity of each observation by assigning an individual weight to the hazard function. By applying a LASSO-type penalty on both the model parameters and the log transformation of the weight vector, our proposed method is able to perform variable selection and outlier detection simultaneously. The optimization problem can be transformed to a typical penalized maximum partial likelihood problem and thus it is easy to implement.

Herein we evaluated the impact of partially humanizing mouse bone marrow with human bone marrow-derived stromal cells (BMSC, also known as ""mesenchymal stem cells"") on human PCa cell behaviour.  Methods:   BMSC are key cellular constituents of marrow. We used intrafemoral injection to transplant 5 × 105 luciferase (Luc) and green fluorescence protein (GFP) expressing human BMSC (hBMSC-Luc/GFP) into the right femur of non-obese diabetic (NOD)-severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) interleukin (IL)-2γ-/- (NSG) mice. Two weeks later, 2.5 × 106 PC-3 prostate cancer cells expressing DsRed (PC-3-DsRed) were delivered into the mice via intracardiac injection. PC-3-DsRed cells were tracked over time using an In Vivo Imaging System (IVIS) live animal imaging system, X-ray and IVIS imaging performed on harvested organs, and PC-3 cell numbers in femurs quantified using flow cytometry and histology.  Results:   Flow cytometry analysis revealed greater PC-3-DsRed cell numbers within femurs of the mice that received hBMSC-Luc/GFP. However, while there were overall greater PC-3-DsRed cell numbers in these animals, there were not more PC-3-DsRed in the femurs injected with hBMSC-Luc/GFP than in contralateral femurs. A similar proportion of mice in with or without hBMSC-Luc/GFP had bone lessions, but the absolute number of bone lesions was greater in mice that had received hBMSC-Luc/GFP.  Conclusion:   PC-3-DsRed cells preferentially populated bones in mice that had received hBMSC-Luc/GFP, although PC-3-DsRed cells not specifically localize in the bone marrow cavity where hBMSC-Luc/GFP had been transplanted. hBMSC-Luc/GFP appear to modify mouse biology in a manner that supports PC-3-DsRed tumor development, rather than specifically influencing PC-3-DsRed cell homing.

Methods:   We analyzed data from a prospective cohort of men enrolled in a statewide public health program that provides care for prostate cancer among low-income, uninsured men from 2001 to 2020. Outcome measures included the RAND SF-12 and the UCLA Prostate Cancer Index (PCI) at baseline and every 6 months. We used generalized estimating equations to assess the independent impact of surgical vs. medical castration on health-related quality of life.  Results:   Among men with metastatic prostate cancer, 27 underwent orchiectomy, and 274 underwent medical castration. Median cohort age at enrollment was 61.3 years (IQR 56-65); 239 (79%) men had less than a high school education. Average follow-up was 8 months (range 0-45) since study enrollment. Seventy percent of patients within the surgical castration group had their orchiectomy prior to study enrollment (median months since orchiectomy at study enrollment was 9 months, IQR 1-43). Similarly, 59% of patients within the medical castration group had begun ADT prior to study enrollment (median months since ADT initiation at study enrollment was 4 months, IQR 1-12). The majority (66%) had metastatic disease at diagnosis. The 2 groups did not differ in age, race/ethnicity, education, monthly income, baseline PSA, Gleason score, or percent metastatic at diagnosis. SF-12 domains did not differ between those who underwent surgical vs. medical castration (on average throughout follow-up, physical component difference -2.0, 95% CI -8.0-3.9 and mental component difference -1.0, 95% CI -5.4-+3.4). Patients treated with orchiectomy reported better urinary function than those who underwent medical castration (+16 point, 95%CI 5.3-26).  Conclusions:   Surgical castration did not negatively impact general or disease-specific quality of life. The finding of improved urination after orchiectomy merits further inquiry.

Dual-modality probe combining radionuclide imaging and near-infrared fluorescence navigation targeting PSMA would enable both the preoperative staging and intraoperative detection of the tumor lesions. To overcome one of the key barriers for achieving high contrast imaging at both early and late time points, we optimized the pharmacokinetics of dual-modality probes based on oxalyldiaminopropionic acid-urea (ODAP-Urea) PSMA inhibitors recently developed. Four dual-modality probes with variable hydrophilicity were synthesized and evaluated. They displayed good optical properties (λem max = 835 nm, QY = 0.67%-1.50%), high affinity to PSMA (Ki = 2.09 ± 1.71-4.15 ± 2.20 nM) and PSMA specific cellular uptake (0.48 ± 0.01% - 0.64 ± 0.04% IA/105 LNCaP cells) upon labeled with 68Ga. In vivo studies showed that [68Ga]Ga-P3 exhibited an optimum pharmacokinetic property with high specific tumor uptake (SUVmax = 1.88 ± 0.36, at 1 h) in medium level PSMA expressing 22Rv1 tumor model and high tumor-to-muscle ratio (12.56 ± 2.63, at 1 h). Specific fluorescence imaging could also be achieved with high contrast for later time points (tumor-to-background ratio = 11.63 ± 4.16 at 24 h).

Increases in proliferation and survival are mediated by natural selection, which can be quantified by comparing the frequency at which we detect substitutions to the frequency at which we expect to detect substitutions assuming neutrality. Most of the variants detectable with whole-exome sequencing in tumors are neutral or nearly neutral in effect, and thus the processes generating the majority of mutations may not be the primary sources of the tumorigenic mutations. Across 24 cancer types, we identify the contributions of mutational processes to each oncogenic variant and quantify the degree to which each process contributes to tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that the origination of variants driving melanomas and lung cancers is predominantly attributable to the preventable, exogenous mutational processes associated with ultraviolet light and tobacco exposure, respectively, whereas the origination of selected variants in gliomas and prostate adenocarcinomas is largely attributable to endogenous processes associated with aging. Preventable mutations associated with pathogen exposure and apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme activity account for a large proportion of the cancer effect within head-and-neck, bladder, cervical, and breast cancers.

In blood-based analyses, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer were estimated using conditional logistic regression from prospective analysis of biomarker concentrations in the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group (up to 25 studies, 14 944 cases and 36 752 controls, including 1870 aggressive prostate cancers). In Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses, using instruments identified using UK Biobank (up to 194 453 men) and outcome data from PRACTICAL (up to 79 148 cases and 61 106 controls, including 15 167 aggressive cancers), ORs were estimated using the inverse-variance weighted method. Free testosterone was associated with aggressive disease in MR analyses (OR per 1 SD = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.08-1.40). In blood-based analyses there was no association with aggressive disease overall, but there was heterogeneity by age at blood collection (OR for men aged <60 years 1.14, CI = 1.02-1.28; Phet = .0003: inverse association for older ages).

Historically, the preferred treatment for these patients has been observation and continued treatment with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The standard of care has recently evolved to include the addition of androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors to ADT. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved 3 next-generation AR inhibitors for nonmetastatic CRPC: apalutamide, enzalutamide, and darolutamide. These agents were approved based on data from phase 3 randomized trials. There is now a significant amount of data from these trials.

Through the same mechanisms HDL could also affect the development and progression of tumors. Cancer cells need cholesterol to proliferate, especially in hormone-dependent tumors, as prostate cancer (PCa). Aim of the study was to investigate the ability of HDL to modulate cholesterol content and metabolism in androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-null PCa cell lines and the consequences on cell proliferation. HDL inhibited colony formation of LNCaP and PC3 cells. HDL reduced cell cholesterol content and proliferation of LNCaP cells loaded with low-density lipoproteins but were not effective on PC3 cells. Here, the expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) was markedly reduced due to proteasome degradation. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, restored ABCA1 expression and HDL ability to promote cholesterol removal from PC3; consequently, HDL inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells induced by LDL only after bortezomib pre-treatment. In conclusion, the antiproliferative activity of HDL on AR-positive and AR-null PCa cells also rely on cholesterol removal, a process in which the ABCA1 transporter plays a key role.""","""['Alice Ossoli', 'Eleonora Giorgio', 'Federica Cetti', 'Massimiliano Ruscica', 'Claudio Rabacchi', 'Patrizia Tarugi', 'Paolo Parini', 'Matteo Pedrelli', 'Monica Gomaraschi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biofactors""","""['High-density lipoprotein induces proliferation and migration of human prostate androgen-independent cancer cells by an ABCA1-dependent mechanism.', 'Proteasomal inhibition promotes ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and ABCG1 expression and cholesterol efflux from macrophages in vitro and in vivo.', 'Statin-induced decrease in ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 expression via microRNA33 induction may counteract cholesterol efflux to high-density lipoprotein.', 'Lipid efflux by the ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1.', 'ATP-binding cassette transporters A1 and G1, HDL metabolism, cholesterol efflux, and inflammation: important targets for the treatment of atherosclerosis.', 'Association between blood lipid levels and risk of gastric cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   We compared total continence results between four different techniques of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Specifically, we studied 1-week and 1-month zero-pad continence rates of anterior (n = 60), posterior (n = 59), a novel hybrid posterior-anterior (n = 12), and transvesical (n = 12) approaches of RARP. Each technique preserved a unique set of periprostatic anatomic structures, thereby, allowing evaluation of the individual impact of preservation of nerves, bladder neck, and space of Retzius with associated anterior support structures on early continence. Urethral length was preserved in all approaches. The space of Retzius was preserved in posterior and transvesical approaches, while the bladder neck was preserved in posterior and hybrid approaches. Nerve sparing was done per preoperative oncological risk. For all patients, 24-h pad usage rates and 24-h pad weights were noted at 1 week and 1 month after catheter removal. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of early continence. Data were obtained from prospective studies conducted between 2015 and 2021.  Results:   At 1 week, 15%, 42%, 45%, and 8% of patients undergoing anterior, posterior, hybrid, and transvesical RARP approaches, respectively, were totally continent (p = 0.003). These rates at 1 month were 35%, 66%, 64%, and 25% (p = 0.002), respectively. The transvesical approach, which preserved the space of Retzius but not the bladder neck, was associated with the poorest continence rates, while the posterior and hybrid approaches in which the bladder neck was preserved with or without space of Retzius preservation were associated with quickest urinary continence recovery. Bladder neck preservation was the only significant predictor of 1-week and 1-month total continence recovery in adjusted analysis, Odds ratios 9.06 (p = 0.001) and 5.18 (p = 0.004), respectively.

Hence, it induces major metabolizing enzyme effects in some of the concomitant drugs, raising the possibility of decreased efficacy. We investigated the actual status of drugs for which precautions for co-administration are indicated during concomitant use with enzalutamide.  Methods:   We retrospectively investigated the duration of enzalutamide use, concomitant medications, laboratory values, and events using the medical records of patients prescribed enzalutamide for castration-resistant prostate cancer at the National Cancer Center Hospital from May 2014 to May 2017.  Results:   The median age of the 107 studied patients was 74 years[range: 53-93], median duration of enzalutamide prescriptions was 120 days[range: 14-1,008], and the median number of concomitant medications(components)was 6[range: 0-16]. Sixty nine patients(64%)were taking drugs that could be affected by enzyme induction. The medications listed in the concomitant use section of the package insert were warfarin(3 patients) and omeprazole(2 patients). In this study, 4 patients(except for 1 on warfarin)were taking other drugs that could be affected by enzyme induction. Events considered to possibly reduce their efficacy during concomitant use with enzalutamide were elevated blood pressure and blood clots.

The normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models, based on dosimetric data refined the normal tissue dose/volume tolerance guidelines. In parallel, the radiation-induced nucleoshuttling (RIANS) of the Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated protein (pATM) is a predictive approach of individual intrinsic radiosensitivity. Here, we combined NTCP with RADIODTECT©, a blood assay derived from the RIANS model, to predict RT toxicity in HNSCC patients.  Methods:   RADIODTECT© cutoff values (i.e. 57.8 ng/mL for grade⩾2 toxicity and 46 ng/mL for grade⩾3 toxicity) have been previously assessed. Validation was performed on a prospective cohort of 36 HNSCC patients treated with postoperative RT. Toxicity was graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) scale and two criteria were considered: grade⩾2 oral mucositis (OM2), grade⩾3 mucositis (OM3) and grade⩾2 dysphagia (DY2), grade⩾3 dysphagia (DY3). pATM quantification was assessed in lymphocytes of HNSCC patients. The discrimination power of the pATM assay was evaluated through the Area Under the Receiver Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC-ROC). Two previously described NTCP models were considered, including the dose to the oral cavity and the mean dose to the parotid glands (OM2 and OM3) and the dose to the oral cavity, to the larynx and the volume of pharyngeal constrictor muscles (DY2 and DY3).  Results:   Combining NTCP models with RADIODTECT© blood test improved the AUC-ROC. Considering the prediction of mucositis, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT©=0.80 was for OM2, and AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT©=0.78 for OM3. Considering the prediction of acute dysphagia, AUC-ROCNTCP+RADIODTECT©=0.71 for DY2 and for DY3.

For many ligand-targeted drug conjugates, a critical aspect of conjugate design lies in engineering release of the therapeutic payload to occur only after its internalization by targeted cells. Because disulfide bond reduction is frequently exploited to ensure intracellular drug release, an understanding of the redox properties of endocytic compartments can be critical to ligand-targeted drug design. While the redox properties of folate receptor trafficking endosomes have been previously reported, little is known about the trafficking of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a receptor that is experiencing increasing use for drug targeting in humans. Methods: To obtain this information, we have constructed a PSMA-targeted fluorescence resonance energy transfer pair that reports on disulfide bond reduction by changing fluorescence from red to green. Results: We show here that this reporter exhibits rapid and selective uptake by PSMA-positive cells, and that reduction of its disulfide bond proceeds steadily but incompletely following internalization. The fact that maximal disulfide reduction reaches only ~50%, even after 24 h incubation, suggests that roughly half of the conjugates must traffic through endosomes that display no reducing capacity. Conclusion: As the level of disulfide reduction differs between PSMA trafficked and previously published folate trafficked conjugates, it also follows that not all internalizing receptors are translocated through similar intracellular compartments. Taken together, these data suggest that the efficiency of disulfide bond reduction must be independently analyzed for each receptor trafficking pathway when disulfide bond reduction is exploited for intracellular drug release.""","""['Chelvam Venkatesh', 'Jiayin Shen', 'Karson S Putt', 'Philip S Low']""","""[]""","""2021""","""None""","""Cancer Drug Resist""","""['Evaluation of disulfide reduction during receptor-mediated endocytosis by using FRET imaging.', 'Oxidizing potential of endosomes and lysosomes limits intracellular cleavage of disulfide-based antibody-drug conjugates.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeted Therapy of Prostate Cancer Using a DUPA-Paclitaxel Conjugate.', 'New Prostate Cancer Targets for Diagnosis, Imaging, and Therapy: Focus on Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', 'Endocytic mechanisms for targeted drug delivery.']"""

This study aimed at the evaluation of their usefulness for tumoral detection and functional assessment of MDR. Methods: The uptake and efflux kinetics of 99mTc-DMEOP and 99mTc-TMEOP were evaluated in human prostate, lung, and breast cancer cell lines, including drug-resistant cell lines that are known to overexpress the MDR P-glycoprotein (Pgp). The effects of MDR modulators were also studied. In vivo studies were performed in xenografted tumor models, and the MDR phenotype of the tumors was confirmed by Western blot. Results: The uptake kinetics of both complexes in human cancer cell lines is comparable with the one found for 99mTc-Sestamibi, increasing over time. The uptake of 99mTc-TMEOP is greatly reduced in cells overexpressing Pgp and increased in the presence of a Pgp modulator. In nude mice, the tumor uptake of 99mTc-TMEOP was higher in the MCF-7 xenografts compared with the MCF7 Pgp tumors.

Homologous Recombination repair (HRR)gene mutation (HRRm) status was identified using targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS). The primary end point includes prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (PSA50). Secondary end points include PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), exploratory endpoints include PSA50, and PSA-PFS in HRRm-negative patients with variants of unknown significance (VUS). Survival rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot. A total of 39 eligible patients with a median age of 65 (interquartile range [IQR]: 59.5-69.5) years were included in the study. Overall, 40% (12/30) of the patients with mCRPC achieved PSA50 and the median PSA-PFS was 3.1 months (95% Confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-7). Furthermore, higher PSA50 rate and longer PSA-PFS were observed in HRRm-positive patients (PSA50: 50% [7/14]; median PSA-PFS: 5.3 months, 95% CI: 3.73-10). Among the HRRm-positive patients, those harboring the BRCA2 aberrations experienced best clinical efficacy (PSA50: 55.5% [5/9] and median PSA-PFS [95% CI]: 9.5 months [4.3, NA]). Clinical benefit was also observed in HRRm-negative patients (PSA50: 31.3% [5/16]; median PSA-PFS [95% CI]:2.05 months [1.5,8]), wherein most patients with a PSA50 response were carrying VUS (PSA50: 50% [4/8]; median PSA-PFS [95% CI]: 2.75 months [1.27, NA]).

In prostate cancer (PCa), this phenotype is reprogrammed, making it an interesting therapeutic target. However, how the truncated prostate TCA cycle works is still not completely understood.  Methods:   We optimized targeted metabolomics in mouse and human organoid models in ex vivo primary culture. We then used stable isotope tracer analyses to identify the pathways that fuel citrate synthesis.  Results:   First, mouse and human organoids were shown to recapitulate the unique citrate-secretory program of the prostate, thus representing a novel model that reproduces this unusual metabolic profile. Using stable isotope tracer analysis, several key nutrients were shown to allow the completion of the prostate TCA cycle, revealing a much more complex metabolic profile than originally anticipated. Indeed, along with the known pathway of aspartate replenishing oxaloacetate, glutamine was shown to fuel citrate synthesis through both glutaminolysis and reductive carboxylation in a GLS1-dependent manner. In human organoids, aspartate entered the TCA cycle at the malate entry point, upstream of oxaloacetate. Our results demonstrate that the citrate-secretory phenotype of prostate organoids is supported by the known aspartate-oxaloacetate-citrate pathway, but also by at least three additional pathways: glutaminolysis, reductive carboxylation, and aspartate-malate conversion.  Conclusions:   Our results add a significant new dimension to the prostate citrate-secretory phenotype, with at least four distinct pathways being involved in citrate synthesis.

However, safe delivery of ablative radiation is frequently limited by the proximity of mobile organs sensitive to high radiation doses. The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility, safety, and disease control outcomes of stereotactic magnetic resonance-guided adaptive radiation therapy (SMART) in patients with abdominopelvic oligometastases.  Methods and materials:   We identified 101 patients with abdominopelvic oligometastases, including 20 patients enrolled on phase 1 protocols, who were consecutively treated with SMART on a 0.35T magnetic resonance linear accelerator (MR linac) at a single institution from October 2019 to September 2021. Local control and overall survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Overall, 114 tumors were treated. The most common histology was prostate adenocarcinoma (60 tumors [53.5%]), and 65 sites (57.0%) were centered in the pelvis. Ninety-one sites (79.8%) were treated to 8 Gy × 5, and 49 (43.0%) were treated with breath-hold respiratory gating. Online adaptation resulted in a clinically significant improvement in coverage or organ sparing in 86.6% of delivered fractions. The median time required for adaptation was 24 minutes, and the median time in the treatment room was 58 minutes. With median follow-up of 11.4 months, the 12-month local control was 93% and was higher for prostate adenocarcinoma versus other histologies (100% vs 84%; P = .009). The 12-month overall survival was 96% and was higher for prostate adenocarcinoma versus other histologies (100% vs 91%; P = .046). Three patients (3.0%) developed grade 3 toxic effects (colonic hemorrhage at 3.4 months and urinary tract obstructions at 10.1 and 18.4 months, respectively).  Conclusions:   In this study, SMART was feasible, safe, and effective for delivering ablative radiation therapy to abdominopelvic metastases. Adaptive planning was necessary in the large majority of cases.

To facilitate continued olaparib treatment as long as the patient derives benefit, we describe further safety assessments from PROfound focusing on the four most common adverse events (AEs) and events of special interest.  Methods:   Patients were randomized (2:1) to olaparib tablets (300 mg bid) or control (enzalutamide or abiraterone) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety was assessed through AE reporting and laboratory assessments. Safety data were also collected from all patients in the control group who experienced radiographic disease progression and subsequently crossed over to olaparib treatment.  Results:   256 patients received olaparib and 130 control. Incidence rates for the four most commonly occurring AEs in the olaparib group (all-causality) were anaemia 50%, nausea 43%, fatigue/asthenia 42% and decreased appetite 31%. All were mostly Grade 1 and 2 and all peaked within the first 2 months of treatment as the events were managed where appropriate, primarily with dose interruptions or dose reductions. The extent of bone metastases at baseline or prior taxane use was not associated with the rate of anaemia. Pneumonitis was reported in 2% and 1.5% of patients in the olaparib and control groups, respectively, and one patient (0.4%) in the olaparib group experienced an event of MDS/AML after a 30-day follow-up period.

Materials and methods:   We assessed the retrospective data from patients treated with RC for UCB of five European University Hospitals. Associations of urethrectomy with progression-free (PFS), cancer-free (CSS), and overall (OS) survivals were assessed in univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. We performed a subgroup analysis in patients at high risk for urethral recurrence (UR) (urethral invasion and/or bladder neck invasion and/or multifocality and/or prostatic urethra involvement).  Results:   A total of 887 non-metastatic UCB patients were included. Among them, 146 patients underwent urethrectomy at the time of RC. Urethrectomy was performed more often in patients with urethral invasion, T3/4 tumor stage, CIS, positive frozen section analysis of the urethra, and those who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, underwent robotic RC, and/or received an ileal conduit urinary diversion (all p < 0.001). Estimated blood loss and the postoperative complication rate were comparable between patients who received an urethrectomy and those who did not. Urethrectomy during RC was not associated with PFS (HR 0.83, p = 0.17), CSS (HR 0.93, p = 0.67), or OS (HR 1.08, p = 0.58). In the subgroup of 276 patients at high risk for UR, urethrectomy at the time of RC decreased the risk of progression (HR 0.58, p = 0.04).  Conclusion:   In our study, urethrectomy at the time of RC seems to benefit only patients at high risk for UR. Adequate risk assessment of UCB patients' history may allow for better clinical decision-making and patient counseling.""","""['Ekaterina Laukhtina#', 'Axelle Boehm#', 'Benoit Peyronnet', 'Carlo Andrea Bravi', 'Jose Batista Da Costa', 'Francesco Soria', ""David D'Andrea"", 'Pawel Rajwa', 'Fahad Quhal', 'Takafumi Yanagisawa', 'Frederik König', 'Hadi Mostafaei', 'Dmitry Enikeev', 'Alexandre Ingels', 'Gregory Verhoest', ""Frederiek D'Hondt"", 'Alexandre Mottrie', 'Steven Joniau', 'Hendrik Van Poppel', 'Alexandre de la Taille', 'Karim Bensalah', 'Franck Bruyère', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Benjamin Pradere']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['A Contemporary Analysis of Urethral Recurrence following Radical Cystectomy.', 'Routine urethroscopic surveillance is of limited value after radical cystectomy: a single centre retrospective cohort analysis.', 'Risk factors and outcomes of urethral recurrence following radical cystectomy.', 'Follow-up of the Urethra and Management of Urethral Recurrence After Radical Cystectomy: A Systematic Review and Proposal of Management Algorithm by the European Association of Urology-Young Academic Urologists: Urothelial Carcinoma Working Group.', 'Management of the male urethra before and after cystectomy: from the prophylactic urethrectomy to the intraoperative frozen section biopsy of the urethral margin.', 'Long-Term Cardiovascular Mortality among 80,042 Older Patients with Bladder Cancer.', 'Neobladder ""Function"": Tips and Tricks for Surgery and Postoperative Management.']"""

Our objective was to evaluate patient- and provider-level characteristics' associations with mortality among a multi-payer cohort of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients who initiated OAAs.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the North Carolina state cancer registry linked to multi-payer claims data for the years 2004 to 2015. Provider data were obtained from North Carolina Health Professions Data System and the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System. Included patients were individuals with mRCC who initiated an OAA and survived ≥90 days after beginning treatment. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence limits (CL) using Cox hazard models for associations between patient demographics, patient clinical characteristics, provider-level factors, and 2-year all-cause mortality.  Results:   The cohort included 207 patients with mRCC who received OAAs. In multivariable models, clinical variables such as frailty (HR: 1.36, 95% CL: 1.11-1.67) and de novo metastatic diagnosis (HR: 2.63, 95%CL: 1.67-4.16) were associated with higher all-cause mortality. Additionally, patients solely on Medicare had higher adjusted all-cause mortality compared with patients with any private insurance (HR: 2.35, 95% CL: 1.32-4.18). No provider-level covariates investigated were associated with all-cause mortality.  Conclusions:   Within a real-world population of mRCC patients taking OAAs, survival differed based on patient characteristics. In an era of rapid expansion of FDA approvals for OAAs, these real-world data underscore the continued importance of access to high-quality care, particularly for medically complex patients with limited resources.""","""['Lisa P Spees', 'Michaela A Dinan', 'Bradford E Jackson', 'Christopher D Baggett', 'Lauren E Wilson', 'Melissa A Greiner', 'Deborah R Kaye', 'Tian Zhang', 'Daniel J George', 'Charles D Scales', 'Jessica E Pritchard', 'Michael Leapman', 'Cary P Gross', 'Stephanie B Wheeler']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Provider- and patient-level predictors of oral anticancer agent initiation and adherence in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.', 'Patterns and Predictors of Oral Anticancer Agent Use in Diverse Patients With Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.', 'Patient, provider, and hospital factors associated with oral anti-neoplastic agent initiation and adherence in older patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.', 'Impact of Clinicopathological Features on Survival in Patients Treated with First-line Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Plus Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors for Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.', 'Evidence Brief: The Quality of Care Provided by Advanced Practice Nurses Internet.']"""

Changes in gene expression occurring in tumours cause morphological changes in tissue, which can be observed on the microscopic level. The relationship between morphological patterns and some of the molecular phenotypes can be exploited to predict molecular phenotypes from routine haematoxylin and eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs) using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we propose a new, computationally efficient approach to model relationships between morphology and gene expression.  Results:   We conducted the first transcriptome-wide analysis in prostate cancer, using CNNs to predict bulk RNA-sequencing estimates from WSIs for 370 patients from the TCGA PRAD study. Out of 15 586 protein coding transcripts, 6618 had predicted expression significantly associated with RNA-seq estimates (FDR-adjusted P-value <1×10-4) in a cross-validation and 5419 (81.9%) of these associations were subsequently validated in a held-out test set. We furthermore predicted the prognostic cell-cycle progression score directly from WSIs. These findings suggest that contemporary computer vision models offer an inexpensive and scalable solution for prediction of gene expression phenotypes directly from WSIs, providing opportunity for cost-effective large-scale research studies and molecular diagnostics.

Moon, has been approved for clinical use in China as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in multiple cancers, including esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer. However, the activity and mechanism of MTE on prostate cancer (PCa) remain to be defined.  Aim of the study:   To investigate the activity and the underlying mechanism of MTE in the treatment of PCa.  Materials and methods:   The component characterization of MTE was analyzed by HPLC-CAD-QTOF-MS/MS technology. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to assess PCa cell proliferation. Colony formation assay was applied to detect the clonogenic ability of the cells. MetaboAnalyst5.0 database was employed to analyze the altered metabolites of PC3 cells treated with MTE obtained by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Combined with metabolomics analysis and network pharmacology, we predicted the potential targets, which further were verified by Western Blot, RT-qPCR, and Immunohistochemistry assays. Finally, SeeSAR software was applied to predict the potential active components of MTE against PCa.  Results:   A total of 21 components in MTE were confirmed by HPLC-CAD-QTOF-MS/MS analysis. MTE inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of PCa cells. A total of 20 metabolites closely related to glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were significantly changed in PC3 cells treated with MTE. The network pharmacology analysis revealed that MTE suppressed the growth of PC3 cells might by regulating the ErbB2-GSK3β-HIF1α signaling axis. Furthermore, we also confirmed that stimulation of MTE significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of ErbB2 at Tyr877 and the activities of its downstream signal transducers (GSK3β and HIF1α) in PCa, as well as the mRNA levels of critical factors (IDH2, LDHA, and HIF1A) in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Molecular docking further suggested that Tenacissimoside E, cryptochlorogenic acid, and scopoletin might be the active ingredients of MTE for PCa treatment.

Emergency department (ED) visits, which may be due to side effects from treatment, can be measured in real-world, structured, electronic health record (EHR) data. The goal of this study was to determine whether treatments for localized prostate cancer are associated with ED visits, as a measure of side effects, using EHR data.  Methods and materials:   We used a self-controlled case series study design, including patients treated at an urban academic medical center with radiation therapy (RT) or radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer between 2011 and 2020 who had visits documented for ≥6 months before and after treatment and ≥1 ED visit. We estimated relative incidences (RI) of ED visits, comparing incidence in the exposed and unexposed periods, with the exposed period being between start of treatment and 1 month after completion, and the unexposed period consisting of all other documented time.  Results:   Among men who had at least 1 ED visit and after adjusting for age, there were higher rates of ED visits after RP (RI, 20.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 15.4-27.0; P < .001), RT overall (RI, 2.4; CI, 1.7-3.4; P < .001), intensity modulated radiation therapy with high dose-rate brachytherapy (RI, 3.4; CI, 1.7-6.8; P < .001) or stereotactic body radiation therapy boost (RI, 7.1; CI, 3.4-14.8; P < .001), and high dose rate brachytherapy alone (RI, 16.3; CI, 7.2-36.9; P < .001) compared with unexposed time. The number needed to harm to result in an ED visit was less for RP (17; CI, 13-23) than RT overall (43; CI, 25-126), but varied by RT modality.  Conclusions:   In summary, relative rates of ED visits vary by treatment type, suggesting differing severities of side effects.

These disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) can survive in bone marrow for years without obvious proliferation, while maintaining the ability to develop into metastatic lesions. However, how DTCs kept dormant and recur is still uncertain. Here, we focus on the role of osteoblastic protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in PCa (PC-3 and DU145) dormancy using co-culture experiments. Using flow cytometry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence, we observed that in co-cultures osteoblasts could induce a dormant state in PCa cells, which is manifested by a fewer cell divisions, a decrease Ki-67-positive populations and a lower ERK/p38 ratio. In contrast, silencing of PKD1 gene in osteoblasts impedes co-cultured prostate cancer cell's dormancy ability. Mechanismly, protein kinase D1 (PKD1) in osteoblasts induces PCa dormancy via activating CREB1, which promoting the expression and secretion of growth arrest specific 6 (GAS6). Furthermore, GAS6-induced dormancy signaling significantly increased the expression of core circadian clock molecules in PCa cells, and a negative correlation of circadian clock proteins (BMAL1, CLOCK and DEC2) with recurrence-free survival is observed in metastatic prostate cancer patients. Interestingly, the expression of cell cycle factors (p21, p27, CDK1 and PCNA) which regulated by circadian clock also upregulated in response to GAS6 stimulation.

As 177Lu has the potential to cure a wide range of malignancies due to its varied range of beta energies, 177Lu-BBN-GABA-DOTA has been developed for therapeutic applications. In addition, 177Lu-BBN-GABA-DOTA can be over-expressed on gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors of the prostate, breast, small cell lung cancer, gastric, and colon tumors. The purpose of this study was to calculate the amount of dose absorption in human body organs using medical internal radiation dose (MIRD) and GATE code methods, after animal injection.

To predict the specific mechanism of HQ in the treatment of CRPC, we will conduct preliminary verification and discussion based on a comprehensive consideration of network pharmacology and molecular docking.  Methods:   TCMSP was used to obtain the compounds and reach the effective targets of HQ. The targets of CRPC were reached based on GeneCards database and CTD database. GO and KEGG were utilized for the analysis of overlapping targets. The software of Openbabel was used to convert the formats of ligands and reporters. In addition, molecular docking studies were performed by using the software of Autodock Vina.  Result:   It can be seen from the database results that there were 87 active compounds (20 key active compounds) in HQ, and 33 targets were screened out for CRPC treatment. GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses identified 81 significant GO terms and 24 significant KEGG pathways. There is a difference in terms of the expression of core protein between cancer patients and healthy people. The expression of core protein in patients also has an impact on the life cycle. The results of molecular docking showed that the docking activity of drug molecules and core proteins was better.

However, 5-ARIs can decrease prostate specific antigen (PSA) by approximately half and therefore may lead to false negative PSA tests. We investigated false-screening rates in men on 5-ARIs undergoing PSA testing and whether ordering physicians noticed false negative findings.  Materials and methods:   A single institution, retrospective study was conducted on patients with a PSA value documented between 2014 and 2017. Patient demographics, PSA results, 5-ARI usage, and providing clinician characteristics were collected. Published normal PSA values were used to determine PSA test positivity; values for those on 5-ARIs were doubled.  Results:   A total of 29,131 men were included. 1,654 (5.7%) were prescribed 5-ARIs at least 12 months prior to PSA evaluation. 118 men (7.1%) had a value that would be positive if corrected for 5-ARI usage, 33 (27.9%) of which had no indication that the provider had noted this. There was no effect on rates of false negative values if the PSA was ordered by a different provider than the one who prescribed the 5-ARI (p = 0.837).

The clinical role of identifying germline variants in these populations is valuable to patients and their at-risk relatives.  Objective:   To evaluate the prevalence of germline findings in patients undergoing tumor/normal matched sequencing among cancer types lacking guidelines.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cross-sectional study took place on August 18, 2021, and included data from deidentified records of patients tested, using the Tempus xT tumor/normal matched approach from November 2017 to August 2021. Records included in this study were from 34 642 patients treated in geographically diverse oncology practices in the US with a diagnosis of any of the following cancers: bladder, brain, lung, esophagus, cholangiocarcinoma, head and neck, breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, endometrial, and colorectal.  Main outcomes and measures:   The rate of germline findings (ie, single-nucleotide variants and small insertions or deletions) detected in 50 reportable hereditary cancer genes was calculated for cancer types lacking guidelines for germline testing (bladder, brain, lung, esophagus, cholangiocarcinoma, and head and neck) and cancer types for which germline testing is frequently performed (breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, endometrial, and colorectal). Same-gene second somatic hits were assessed to provide a comprehensive assessment on genomic drivers.  Results:   Of 34 642 patients, 18 888 were female (54.5%); of 27 498 patients whose age at diagnosis was known, mean (SD) age was 62.23 (3.36) years. A total of 2534 of 34 642 patients (7.3%) harbored pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants. Within the tumor types lacking testing guidelines, germline mutations were at 6.6% (79/1188) in bladder cancer and 5.8% (448/7668) in lung cancer.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study may present the largest retrospective analysis to date of deidentified real-world data from patients diagnosed with advanced cancer with tumor/normal matched sequencing data and the prevalence of pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants in cancer types lacking hereditary cancer testing guidelines. The findings suggest there may be clinical implications for patients and their at-risk family members in cancers for which germline assessment primarily based on the cancer diagnosis is rarely obtained.""","""['Timothy A Yap', 'Arya Ashok', 'Jessica Stoll', 'Elizabeth Mauer', 'Vanessa M Nepomuceno', 'Kimberly L Blackwell', 'Judy E Garber', 'Funda Meric-Bernstam']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Paired Tumor-Germline Testing as a Driver in Better Cancer Care.', 'Yield and Utility of Germline Testing Following Tumor Sequencing in Patients With Cancer.', 'Prevalence of Germline Variants in Prostate Cancer and Implications for Current Genetic Testing Guidelines.', 'Detection of Pathogenic Germline Variants Among Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Tumor Genomic Profiling for Precision Medicine.', 'A review of the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing for germline variants in familial cancer.', 'Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer: diagnostic strategies and their implications.', 'Global trends in the epidemiology of bladder cancer: challenges for public health and clinical practice.', 'Atypical ATMs: Broadening the phenotypic spectrum of ATM-associated hereditary cancer.', 'The cancer-risk variant frequency among Polish population reported by the first national whole-genome sequencing study.', 'Lung cancer in never smokers: Tumor immunology and challenges for immunotherapy.']"""

Furan and C8H10 molecules have been considered as important biomarkers of prostate cancer patients. First-principles DFT calculations are applied, and the results divulged that pristine GP could be a promising candidate for furan and C8H10 detection. It is manifested that furan and C8H10 are physisorbed on the S-, and Si-doped GP with small adsorption energy and negligible charge transfer. However, the calculations disclose that furan and C8H10 are chemically adsorbed on the pristine GP with adsorption energy of -0.73, and -1.46 eV, respectively. Moreover, we observe that a large charge is transferred from furan to the pristine GP with amount of -0.106 e. Additionally, pristine GP shows short recovery time of 1.81 s at room temperature under the visible light, which make it a reusable sensor device.

We analyzed the incidence and mortality and risk factors of cancer in the member countries of the ""B&R"" to explore the basis of health and medical cooperation between countries and provide a foundation for formulating cancer prevention and control policies for building a healthy ""B&R.""  Methods:   Data were derived from the Global Cancer Observatory and Cancer Country Profiles in 2020. Incidence and mortality were age-standardized rates (ASRs). Population attributable fractions (PAFs) was applied to measure risk factors of cancers in the ""B&R"" countries. The mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was calculated by dividing the mortality rate by the incidence rate.  Results:   A total of 26 cancers were included in the study. Lung, breast, colorectal, stomach, liver, prostate, cervical, esophageal, thyroid, and uterine cancers were the most common and highest in age-standardized mortality in the ""B&R"" countries. For men, Hungary had the highest cancer age-standardized incidence and mortality (ASR, 289.3 per 100,000 and ASR, 235.7 per 100,000, respectively), followed by Latvia (ASR, 288.6 per 100,000 and ASR, 196.5 per 100,000, respectively). In females, the highest incidence rates were estimated in Greece (ASR, 238.7 per 100,000), and the highest mortality rate was Brunei (ASR, 192.3 per 100,000). All countries were in the middle or high HDI range, with about half (46.88%) of countries achieving high HDI, mostly in Central and Eastern Europe (13 countries) and West Asia (10 countries). The United Arab Emirates had the highest MIR in male and female (1.59 vs 2.19). Tobacco products, infectious factors, and ultraviolet rays were the three main cancer risk factors in the ""B&R"" countries.

Methods and results:   This in vitro research was conducted to evaluate the apoptotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiproliferative properties of ethanolic extract of Brassica oleracea var. acephala (EEBO) in PC3 prostate cancer cells. The LC-MS/MS technique was applied to identify the biomolecules of EEBO. The MTT assay was used to evaluate the cytotoxic effects of EEBO on PC3 cells. Moreover, qRT-PCR was used to examine the expression levels of Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, BAX, and BCL-2 in PC3 cell line. MMP was predicted by Rhodamine 123 staining, and release of cytochrome c was detected by an ELISA kit. Further, apoptosis was quantified by DNA fragmentation assay. The Western blotting method was used to detect the protein expression levels, and The DPPH assay was applied to determine the antioxidant effect of EEBO. The formula and structure of 19 biomolecules were predicted by LC-MS/MS. EEBO exhibited scavenging activity for DPPH. The MTT test showed EEBO reduced the viability of PC3 cells. The mRNA and protein levels of NRF2 pathway genes and BAX were increased, but those of the NF-κB pathway genes and BCL-2 were decreased in the EEBO-treated cells. Moreover, EEBO led to the diminution of MMP and enhanced the release of cytochrome c and DNA fragmentation, which resulted in apoptosis.

There are little data relating to the prognostic significance of quantifying the percentage of Gleason pattern 5 in isolation. We investigated the prognostic predictive value of quantifying the percentage of Gleason pattern 5 tumour in needle biopsies from a series of 196 cases of Gleason score 4+5=9 prostate adenocarcinoma from patients who had also undergone radical prostatectomy. Division of cases according to the percentage of Gleason pattern 5 present (based upon the core with the highest grade) and analysing these with tumour grouped as Gleason score 4+5 with <5% pattern 5 (GS 4+5 <5%), Gleason score 4+5 with 5-20% pattern 5 (GS 4+5 5-20%) and Gleason score 4+5 with 21-49% pattern 5 (GS 4+5 21-49%) showed no difference in outcome determined as time interval to prostate specific antigen biochemical failure. The results showed that each of the subgroups of GS 4+5 tumours had a significantly shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival than for a control group of 179 patients with Gleason score 4+3=7 (GS 4+3) cancer. Similar results were obtained when grading was based upon percentage of Gleason pattern 5 present in all the cores taken from the same patient (case-based grade). Adverse findings at radical prostatectomy showed each of the subgroups of GS 4+5 tumours to have a higher incidence of extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion than the GS 4+3 group of controls. Further, the differences in incidence between each of the subgroups were not significant for either extraprostatic extension or seminal vesicle invasion. These observations applied to both the highest core-based grade and the case-based grade.

UV1 is a second generation telomerase-targeting therapeutic cancer vaccine being investigated across multiple indications. Although telomerase is a near-universal tumor target, different treatment combinations applied across indications may affect the induced immune response. Three phase I/IIa clinical trials covering malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer have been completed, with patients in follow-up for up to 8 years.  Methods:   52 patients were enrolled across the three trials. UV1 was given as monotherapy in the lung cancer trial and concurrent with combined androgen blockade in the prostate cancer trial. In the melanoma study, patients initiated ipilimumab treatment 1 week after the first vaccine dose. Patients were followed for UV1-specific immune responses at frequent intervals during vaccination, and every 6 months for up to 8 years in a follow-up period. Phenotypic and functional characterizations were performed on patient-derived vaccine-specific T cell responses.  Results:   In total, 78.4% of treated patients mounted a measurable vaccine-induced T cell response in blood. The immune responses in the malignant melanoma trial, where UV1 was combined with ipilimumab, occurred more rapidly and frequently than in the lung and prostate cancer trials. In several patients, immune responses peaked years after their last vaccination.

Here, we presented for the first time the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) and piezoelectric effects co-enhance the construction of an efficient intra-body phase electric field for the construction of efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensors. Briefly, the LSPR enhancement and piezoelectric enhancement effects between Ag nanoparticles and the piezoelectric material NaNbO3 were investigated in a PEC biosensor system under the excitation of portable UV light. Notably, the simplified treatment of the basic building blocks of the PEC sensor, including a handheld UV flashlight instead of a physical excitation light source and a digital multimeter instead of an electrochemical workstation. The capture and immunoincubation process of target PSA occurs on separated microtiter plates and hydrogen peroxide, generated by enzyme-linked immunization, induces the directional separation of electrons and holes in the composite heterogeneous material under the excitation of light. The coupling with a digital multimeter allows for real-time monitoring of photocurrents. Further, the effect of Ag deposition on piezoelectric perovskite NaNbO3 was obtained by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Impressively, under optimized conditions, the system exhibits an ultra-wide linear range and ultra-low detection limits for the target PSA. The system is also comparable to commercially available ELISA kits at the 95% confidence level.

In these cancers, BRCA1/2 alterations and genomic scar signatures are useful indicators for assessing HRD. However, alterations in other homologous recombination repair (HRR)-related genes and their clinical significance in other cancer types have not been adequately and systematically investigated.  Methods:   We obtained data sets of all solid tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas and comprehensively analyzed HRR pathway gene alterations, their loss-of-heterozygosity status, per-sample genomic scar scores, ie, the HRD score and mutational signature 3 ratio, DNA methylation profiles, gene expression profiles, somatic TP53 mutations, sex, and clinical information including chemotherapeutic regimens.  Results:   Biallelic alterations in HRR genes other than BRCA1/2 were also associated with elevated genomic scar scores. The association between HRR-related gene alterations and genomic scar scores differed significantly by sex and the presence of somatic TP53 mutations. HRD cases determined by a combination of these indices also showed HRD features in gene expression analysis and were associated with better survival when treated with DNA-damaging agents.

Methods:   We performed a matched (up to 1:5) cohort study of male patients with and without RA in the VA from 2000 to 2018. RA status, as well as covariates, were obtained from national VA databases. Prostate cancer was identified through linked VA cancer databases and the National Death Index. Multivariable Cox models compared prostate cancer risk between patients with RA and patients without RA, including models that accounted for retention in the VA system.  Results:   We included 56,514 veterans with RA and 227,284 veterans without RA. During 2,337,104 patient-years of follow-up, 6,550 prostate cancers occurred. Prostate cancer incidence (per 1,000 patient-years) was 3.50 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 3.32-3.69) in patients with RA and 2.66 (95% CI 2.58-2.73) in patients without RA. After accounting for confounders and censoring for attrition of VA health care, RA was modestly associated with a higher prostate cancer risk (adjusted HR [HRadj ] 1.12 [95% CI 1.04-1.20]). There was no association between RA and prostate cancer mortality (HRadj 0.92 [95% CI 0.73-1.16]).

However, development of drug resistance is common, which eventually leads to development of castration-resistant PCa. This warrants a better understanding of the pathophysiology of PCa that facilitates the aberrant activation of key signaling pathways including AR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function as regulators of cancer progression as they modulate various cellular processes. Here, we demonstrate a multidimensional function of miR-30e through the regulation of genes involved in various signaling pathways. We noted loss of miR-30e expression in prostate tumors, which, when restored, led to cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, improved drug sensitivity of PCa cells and reduced tumor progression in xenograft models. We show that experimental upregulation of miR-30e reduces expression of mRNAs including AR, FBXO45, SRSF7 and MYBL2 and a novel long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) HELLPAR, which are involved in cell cycle, apoptosis and ubiquitination, and the effects could be rescued by inhibition of miR-30e expression. RNA immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed direct interactions between miR-30e and its RNA targets. We noted a newly identified reciprocal relationship between miR-30e and HELLPAR, as inhibition of HELLPAR improved stabilization of miR-30e. Transcriptome profiling and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation of miR-30e-expressing PCa cells showed differential expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and ubiquitination, which supports our in vitro study.

MIR22HG and microRNA (miR)-9-3p expressions in prostate cancer cells were examined with the use of quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Cell counting kit (CCK)-8, colony formation, and TUNEL were conducted to determine cell viability and apoptosis. Immunofluorescence was employed for the detection of Ki67 expression, and western blotting was applied for the examination of apoptosis-related proteins. The relationship of MIR22HG and miR-9-3p was verified employing luciferase reporter assay. Indeed, low MIR22HG expression was discovered in prostate cancer cells. Subsequently, in vitro loss-of-function studies revealed that MIR22HG overexpression suppressed cell proliferation but promoted cell apoptosis, accompanied with a reduction in Ki67 and Bcl-2 expressions, as well as an elevation in Bax and cleaved caspase 3 expressions. In addition, MIR22HG was identified as a sponge of miR-9-3p and the impacts of MIR22HG overexpression on cell proliferation and apoptosis were partly hindered by miR-9-3p overexpression.

However, the current research on the diagnosis and treatment of nano-ultrasound contrast agents in the field of tumor is mostly focused on breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, etc. Due to the interference of gas in the stomach, there is no report on the treatment of gastric cancer. Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovir (HSV-TK/GCV) therapy system is the most mature tumor suicide gene in cancer treatment. At the same time, in order to improve its safety and efficiency, we designed a gastric tumor targeted ultrasound-triggered phase-transition nano ultrasound contrast agent PFH/AGM-CBA/HSV-TK/Liposome (PAHL)-Affibody complex.  Methods:   In our study, guanidinylated SS-PAAs polymer poly(agmatine/N, N'-cystamine-bis-acrylamide) (AGM-CBA) was used as a nuclear localization vector of suicide gene to form a polyplex, perfluorohexane (PFH) was used as ultrasound contrast agent, liposomes were used to encapsulate perfluorohexane droplets and the polyplexes of AGM-CBA/HSV-TK, and affibody molecules were conjugated to the prepared PAHL in order to obtain a specific targeting affinity to human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (ErbB2) at gastric cancer cells. With the aid of ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction technology and the nuclear localization effect of AGM-CBA vector, the transfection efficiency of the suicide gene in gastric cancer cells was significantly increased, leading to significant apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.  Results:   It was shown that PAHL-Affibody complex was nearly spherical with an average diameter of 560 ± 28.9 nm, having higher and specific affinity to ErbB2 (+) gastric cells. In vitro experiments further confirmed that PAHL could target gastric cancer cells expressing ErbB2. In a contrast-enhanced ultrasound scanning study, the prepared ultrasound-triggered phase-change nano-ultrasound contrast agent, PAHL, showed improved ultrasound enhancement effects. With the application of the low-frequency ultrasound, the gene transfection efficiency of PAHL was significantly improved, thereby inducing significant apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.

Recently there has been evidence that oral cholera vaccine might be used in the treatment of inflammatory disease and some common cancers. Specifically, Ji et al showed that the administration of cholera vaccine after a prostate cancer diagnosis reduced prostate cancer specific mortality rates by almost 50%. In a cohort of men from Stockholm, Sweden, with more detailed cancer data and a higher coverage of exposure to vaccine, we replicated these findings using a marginal structural Cox model. We showed that administration of cholera vaccine after prostate cancer diagnosis is associated with a significant reduction in mortality (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.31-0.69, p-value 0.0001) even after adjusting for all known confounders. However, the same effect (or even stronger) could be seen for several other traveling vaccines and malaria prophylaxis.

We examined this scenario in patients with non-metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) eligible for adjuvant pembrolizumab after nephrectomy. We hypothesized that a proportion of such patients will either require re-treatment with pembrolizumab upon metastatic progression prior to cancer-specific mortality (CSM) or die from other cause mortality (OCM).  Materials and methods:   We identified within the SEER database 10,635 patients, between 2004 and 2017, with a diagnosis of non-metastatic intermediate-high and high risk RCC, who had undergone nephrectomy and fulfilled criteria for enrollment in KEYNOTE-564. Kaplan-Meier analyses addressed overall survival (OS), CSM and OCM.  Results:   9,825 (92.4%) of the 10,635 patients had intermediate-high risk RCC and 9,456 (88.9%) underwent radical nephrectomy. Additionally, 760 (7.1%) harbored sarcomatoid features. In Kaplan-Meier analyses, median OS was 9.8 (9.1-11.4) years. At 10-years of follow-up, CSM rate was 36% and OCM rate was 22%.  Conclusions:   Based on CSM, our observations indicate that by 10-years of follow-up 36% of patients treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab will require a rechallenge, in a setting where a checkpoint inhibitor may have reduced efficacy. Moreover, at 10-years of follow-up, 22% of patients with RCC, previously treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab, will die of other causes.

This response is often hijacked by cancer cells to evade cell death allowing mutant cells to persist, as well as in the development of treatment resistance to DNA damaging agents such as chemotherapy and radiation. Prostate cancer (PCa) cells often exhibit alterations in DNA damage response genes including ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), correlating with aggressive disease phenotype. The recent success of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition has led to several clinically approved PARP inhibitors for the treatment of men with metastatic PCa, however a key limitation is the development of drug resistance and relapse. An alternative approach is selectively targeting ATM and ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) which, due to their position at the forefront of the DDR, represent attractive pharmacological targets. ATR inhibition has been shown to act synergistically with PARP inhibition and other cancer treatments to enhance anti-tumour activity. ATM-deficiency is a common characteristic of PCa and a synthetic lethal relationship exists between ATM and ATR, with ATR inhibition inducing selective cell death in ATM-deficient PCa cells. The current research highlights the feasibility of therapeutically targeting ATR in ATM-deficient prostate tumours and in combination with other treatments to enhance overall efficacy and reduce therapeutic resistance.

Given the rising importance of magnetic resonance (MR) only treatment planning workflows, we sought to determine if an ML based treatment planning model, trained on computed tomography (CT) imaging, could be applied to MR through domain adaptation.Methods.In this study, MR and CT imaging was collected from 55 prostate cancer patients treated on an MR linear accelerator. ML based plans were generated for each patient on both CT and MR imaging using a commercially available model in RayStation 8B. The dose distributions and acceptance rates of MR and CT based plans were compared using institutional dose-volume evaluation criteria. The dosimetric differences between MR and CT plans were further decomposed into setup, cohort, and imaging domain components.Results.MR plans were highly acceptable, meeting 93.1% of all evaluation criteria compared to 96.3% of CT plans, with dose equivalence for all evaluation criteria except for the bladder wall, penile bulb, small and large bowel, and one rectum wall criteria (p< 0.05). Changing the input imaging modality (domain component) only accounted for about half of the dosimetric differences observed between MR and CT plans. Anatomical differences between the ML training set and the MR linac cohort (cohort component) were also a significant contributor.Significance.We were able to create highly acceptable MR based treatment plans using a CT-trained ML model for treatment planning, although clinically significant dose deviations from the CT based plans were observed.

However, whether lncRNA PCAT6 in NSCLC cells could affect the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains unclear. In the present study, the level of PCAT6 in NSCLC cells was detected using RT-qPCR. The effects of PCAT6 knockdown on the viability and apoptosis in NSCLC cells were detected with CCK-8 and flow cytometry assay. NSCLC cell-derived exosomes were isolated with ultracentrifugation. Next, transwell assay was conducted to assess the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the relationship among PCAT6, miR-326, and KLF1 in A549 cells. In addition, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was applied to detect the particle size of isolated exosomes. Moreover, ELISA assay was performed to detect the levels of IL-1β and IL-10 in the supernatant of macrophage. We found knockdown of PCAT6 significantly inhibited the viability, migration, and invasion of NSCLC cells. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assay illustrated that miR-326 was the target of PCAT6 and KLF1 was the target of miR-326 in NSCLC cells. Moreover, NSCLC cells-derived exosomes could promote macrophages M2 polarization by transporting PCAT6. Meanwhile, macrophages M2 polarization was able to promote the metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process of NSCLC cells via regulating PCAT6/miR-326/KLF1 axis.

Methods:   Data on 670 men who participated in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-9601 trial and who experienced biochemical recurrence were extracted using the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) data archive platform. Patients were stratified into four treatment groups: early sRT (pre-sRT prostate-specific antigen [PSA] < 0.7 ng/mL) and late sRT (pre-sRT PSA ≥ 0.7 ng/mL) with/without concomitant AAT, based on cut-offs reported in the original trial.

Purpose To compare the performance of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT or PET/MRI (PET) with bone scan and CT with or without multiparametric MRI (hereafter, referred to as conventional imaging) in the initial staging of men with unfavorable intermediate or high-risk PCa and to assess treatment change after PET. Materials and Methods This prospective study evaluated men with biopsy-proven, untreated, unfavorable intermediate or high-risk PCa with 0 to four metastases or equivocal for extensive metastases (more than four) who underwent PET between May 2018 and December 2020. The diagnostic performance of PET in detecting pelvic nodal and distant metastases was compared with conventional imaging alone. Metastatic sites at conventional imaging and PET were compared with a composite reference standard including histopathologic analysis, correlative imaging, and/or clinical and biochemical follow-up. The intended treatment before PET was compared with the treatment plan established after performing PET. Detection rate, sensitivity, and specificity of conventional imaging and PET were compared by using McNemar exact test on paired proportions. Results The study consisted of 108 men (median age, 66 years; IQR, 61-73 years) with no metastases (n = 84), with oligometastases (four or fewer metastases; 22 men), or with equivocal findings for extensive metastases (n = 2). Detection rates at PET and conventional imaging for nodal metastases were 34% (37 of 108) and 11% (12 of 108) (P < .001), respectively, and those for distant metastases were 22% (24 of 108) and 10% (11 of 108) (P = .02), respectively. PET altered stage in 43 of 108 (40%) and treatment in 24 of 108 (22%) men. The most frequent treatment change was from systemic to local-regional therapy in 10 of 108 (9%) and from local-regional to systemic therapy in nine of 108 (8%) men.

There were 302 patients (97.7%) who wished to be reexamined during the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of treatment, the proportion of patients ""awaiting observation"" declined from 13.9% to 4.4%, and the proportion of patients ""awaiting surgery"" increased from 4.9% to 16.4%. Using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) scale, the percentage of patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms increased from 79.9% to 90.1%, and the proportion with a quality of life (QOL) score ≥ 5 rose from 82.5% to 88.9%. The proportions of patients exhibiting storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms in lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) increased from 77.3%, 21.7%, and 18.8% to 91.9%, 27.5%, and 25.5%, respectively; those manifesting hematuria and urinary retention increased from 0.9% and 0.6% to 2.3% and 1.7%, respectively; those with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) > 4 ng/ml rose from 10.0% to 15.1%; patients with a maximum flow rate (Qmax) < 15 ml/s increased from 82.5% to 92.3%, and the proportion with a Qmax < 10 ml/s increased from 8.7% to 15.4%; the individuals with a prostate volume > 30 ml increased from 94.1% to 97.0%; the percentage of men with a bladder residual urine volume > 10 ml was augmented from 81.6% to 89.3%, and patients with prostate nodules on physical examination were elevated from 1.0% to 1.7%. We uncovered no prostate cancer in patients, and the proportion of patients administered the combination drug increased from 78.9% to 91.2%. Compared with patients receiving online or telephone consultations, patients undergoing reexamination at the hospital were better controlled. When we conducted a survey of whether patients chose to go to a public or private hospital for follow-up, we found that 46.6% of the patients chose to go to a private medical institution.  Conclusions:   COVID-19 greatly affected the treatment of patients with BPH. When conditions permit, we recommend that patients first consider going to the hospital for evaluation; however, when this is not possible, medical institutions should provide telephone or online consultation for patients with BPH. Surgical treatment should also be arranged for those in need as soon as possible to avoid delaying the patient's treatment.""","""['Ke Ding', 'Rui Tang', 'JiangFan Yu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Influence of baseline variables on changes in International Prostate Symptom Score after combined therapy with dutasteride plus tamsulosin or either monotherapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms: 4-year results of the CombAT study.', 'Prostatic arterial embolization for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia: a comparative study of medium- and large-volume prostates.', 'Construct validation of patient global impression of severity (PGI-S) and improvement (PGI-I) questionnaires in the treatment of men with lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of prostatic artery embolisation for lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Is COVID-19 a risk factor for progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia and exacerbation of its related symptoms?: a systematic review.']"""

Morphological and molecular consequences that may contribute to RT resistance and local recurrence remain poorly understood. Locally recurrent PCa tissue from 53 patients with clinically localized PCa who failed with primary RT and subsequently underwent salvage radical prostatectomy (RP) was analyzed for tumor focality, clinicopathological, molecular, and genomic characteristics. Targeted next-generation sequencing with full exon coverage of 1,425 cancer-related genes was performed on 10 representative radiorecurrent PCas exhibiting no RT effect with matched adjacent benign prostate tissue. At RP, 37 (70%) of PCas had no RT effect with the following characteristics: grade group (GG) ≥ 3 (70%), unifocal tumor (75%), extraprostatic disease (78%), lymph node metastasis (8%), and ""cribriform"" morphologies (84%) [cribriform PCa (78%) or intraductal carcinoma (IDC-P) (61%)] at a median percentage of approximately 80% of tumor volume. In the setting of multifocal tumors (25%) at RP, the cribriform morphologies were restricted to index tumors. Of 32 patients with available pre-RT biopsy information, 16 had GG1 PCa, none had cribriform morphologies at baseline but 81% demonstrated cribriform morphologies at RP. Notable alterations detected in the sequenced tumors included: defects in DNA damage response and repair (DDR) genes (70%) (TP53, BRCA2, PALB2, ATR, POLQ), PTEN loss (50%), loss of 8p (80%), and gain of MYC (70%). The median tumor mutational burden was 4.18 mutations/Mb with a range of 2.16 to 31.86. Our findings suggest that most radiorecurrent PCas are enriched in cribriform morphologies with potentially targetable genomic alterations. Understanding this phenotypic and genotypic diversity of radiorecurrent PCa is critically important to facilitate optimal patient management.""","""['Rajal B Shah', 'Doreen N Palsgrove', 'Neil B Desai', 'Jeffrey Gagan', 'Amanda Mennie', 'Ganesh Raj', 'Raquibul Hannan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Sensitivity of multiparametric MRI and targeted biopsy for detection of adverse pathologies (Cribriform gleason pattern 4 and intraductal carcinoma): Correlation of detected and missed prostate cancer foci with whole mount histopathology.', 'PTEN loss in prostatic adenocarcinoma correlates with specific adverse histologic features (intraductal carcinoma, cribriform Gleason pattern 4 and stromogenic carcinoma).', 'Cribriform and intraductal prostate cancer are associated with increased genomic instability and distinct genomic alterations.', 'Prostate cancer with cribriform morphology: diagnosis, aggressiveness, molecular pathology and possible relationships with intraductal carcinoma.', 'Cribriform Prostate Cancer: Clinical Pathologic and Molecular Considerations.']"""

Setting:   The male general population of Sweden (using the Nationwide Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden).  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Crude incidence proportion ratios (IPRs) comparing the incidence of VTE in men with prostate cancer and men in the comparison cohort. Cox regression was used to calculate HRs for VTE adjusted for confounders.  Results:   2955 men with prostate cancer and 9774 men in the comparison cohort experienced a first VTE during a median of 4.5 years' follow-up. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) accounted for 52% of VTE cases in both cohorts. Median time from start of follow-up to VTE was 2.5 years (IQR 0.9-4.7) in the prostate cancer cohort and 2.9 years (IQR 1.3-5.0) in the comparison cohort. Crude incidence rates of VTE per 1000 person-years were 6.54 (95% CI 6.31 to 6.78) in the prostate cancer cohort (n=2955 events) and 4.27 (95% CI 4.18 to 4.35) in the comparison cohort (n=9774 events).

Materials and methods:   We ascertained perioperative complication rates within the National Inpatient Sample database (2016-2019). First, log-link linear Generalized Estimating Equation function (GEE) regression models (adjusted for hospital clustering and weighted for discharge disposition) tested complication rates in IVC-T patients, according to metastatic stage. Subsequently, a subgroup analysis relied on RN patients with or without IVC-T. Here, multivariable logistic regression models tested complication rates in RN patients according to IVC-T status, after propensity score matching including metastatic stage.  Results:   Of 26,299 RN patients, 461 (2%) patients underwent IVC-T. Of those, 252 (55%) were non-metastatic vs 209 (45%) were metastatic. Rates of acute kidney injury (AKI), transfusion, cardiac, thromboembolic and other medical complications in non-metastatic vs metastatic patients were 40 vs 40%, 25 vs 22%, 21 vs 23%, 19 vs 14% and 38 vs 40%, respectively (all p ≥ 0.2). Metastatic stage in IVC-T patients did not predict differences in complications in log-link linear GEE regression models (all p > 0.1). However, in logistic regression models with propensity score matching, relying on the overall cohort of RN patients, IVC-T status was associated with higher complication rates (all p < 0.001): AKI (Odds ratio [OR]:2.60; 95%-CI [95%-Confidence interval: 1.97-3.44), transfusions (OR:2.40; 95%-CI: 1.72-3.36), cardiac (OR:2.27; 95%-CI: 1.49-3.47), thromboembolic (OR:9.07; 95%-CI: 5.21-16.58) and other medical complications (OR:2.01; 95%-CI: 1.52-2.66).

Method:   All breast cancers diagnosed at the Department of Mammography, Falun Central Hospital, Sweden, since 1977 have been classified according to their mammographic tumour features (imaging biomarkers) and followed up at regular intervals for the past four decades. The imaging biomarkers characteristic of breast cancers apparently arising from the major lactiferous ducts have been correlated with large format thin and thick section histopathology and long-term patient outcome.  Results:   Breast cancers arising within the major lactiferous ducts propagate intraductally and produce continuously branching neoducts through epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT), an invasive process termed neoductgenesis, which eventually forms a massive tumour burden. The high fatality of this breast cancer subtype indicates its truly invasive nature, although it is conventionally termed ductal carcinoma in situ, DCIS, terminology which is at odds with its poor long-term patient outcome. The neoducts are filled with multiple layers of malignant cells, have no attached lobules, and propagate by forming multiple invasive side branches. These newly formed duct-like structures are surrounded by a desmoplastic reaction (cancer associated fibroblasts, CAFs) and periductal lymphocytic infiltration. The neoducts are tightly packed together in irregular formations bearing no resemblance to the paniculate branching structure of normal lactiferous ducts. Cancers originating from the major ducts have six imaging biomarkers which can be easily recognized at breast imaging. These are described in detail in an accompanying article.  Conclusions:   Neoductgenesis in the breast, DAB, is similar in appearance and prognosis to ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate, DAP. We propose the term ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, DAB, to facilitate its recognition as a distinct invasive breast cancer subtype. The high fatality rates associated with neoductgenesis reflect the failure of current histopathologic diagnostic criteria to effectively guide therapeutic practice. When the neoducts are associated with small stellate/spiculated or spherical/oval-shaped invasive cancers arising from the terminal ductal lobular units (TDLUs), the prognosis and management are erroneously estimated according to the smaller invasive tumour(s), giving a false sense of security often resulting in undertreatment. Recognition that neoductgenesis is an invasive malignancy is a prerequisite for preventing treatment failure.""","""['László Tabár', 'Peter B Dean', 'F Lee Tucker', 'Amy Ming-Fang Yen', 'Rene Wei-Jung Chang', 'Chen-Yang Hsu', 'Robert A Smith', 'Stephen W Duffy', 'Tony Hsiu-Hsi Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Imaging biomarkers of breast cancers originating from the major lactiferous ducts: Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, DAB.', 'Breast cancers originating from the terminal ductal lobular units: In situ and invasive acinar adenocarcinoma of the breast, AAB.', 'A new approach to breast cancer terminology based on the anatomic site of tumour origin: The importance of radiologic imaging biomarkers.', 'Ductal carcinoma in situ: a disease entity that merits more recognition.', 'Ductal carcinoma in situ: terminology, classification, and natural history.', 'Does Diffusely Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast Arise from Epithelial-Mesenchymal Hybrid Cells?']"""

However, responses are variable, in part due to low PSMA expression in 30% of patients. Herein, we evaluated whether the cell surface protein CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) can be exploited to treat mCRPC with RLT, including in PSMA-low subsets.  Experimental design:   CDCP1 levels were evaluated using RNA sequencing from 119 mCRPC biopsies. CDCP1 levels were assessed in 17 post-enzalutamide- or abiraterone-treated mCRPC biopsies, 12 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and prostate cancer cell lines. 4A06, a recombinant human antibody that targets the CDCP1 ectodomain, was labeled with Zr-89 or Lu-177 and tested in tumor-bearing mice.  Results:   CDCP1 expression was observed in 90% of mCRPC biopsies, including small-cell neuroendocrine (SCNC) and adenocarcinomas with low FOLH1 (PSMA) levels. Fifteen of 17 evaluable mCRPC biopsies (85%) demonstrated membranous CDCP1 expression, and 4 of 17 (23%) had higher CDCP1 H-scores compared with PSMA. CDCP1 was expressed in 10 of 12 PDX samples.

Methods and materials:   We retrospectively reviewed our clinical database for men with PCA who underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for imaging evaluation of BCR with negative or equivocal findings on conventional imaging. We included patients with up to and including 5 metastases (oligometastases) regardless of imaging evidence for local recurrence in the treated prostate bed. We examined the association between mean serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels with the number of oligometastases (non-parametric ANOVA) and between patients with or without local recurrence (Student t-test). The management impact of oligometastatic disease was tabulated.  Results:   We identified 21 patients with oligometastases upon first BCR (PSA 0.2-56.8 ng/mL) out of 89 eligible patients. There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) in the mean PSA levels between patients with local recurrence (n = 12) and those without local recurrence (n = 9). In the subgroup of analysis of patients without local recurrence, there was no significant association between mean PSA level and number of oligometastases (p = 0.83). Distribution of oligometastases included 66.7% isolated nodal disease and 33.3% bone only. Twelve (57.1%) patients had change in management to include change in ADT, salvage therapy, or both. Treatment change was initiated in 62.5%, 28.6%, 66.7%, 100%, and 100% of patients with 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 oligometastatic lesions, respectively.  Conclusion:   The incidence rate of oligometastatic disease in men with first BCR of PCA undergoing 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT for imaging evaluation of BCR was 23.6% in our eligible patient population.

We previously showed that bone marrow neutrophils elicit an anti-tumor immune response against BM-PCa. Further, we demonstrated that BM-PCa induces neutrophil oxidative burst, which has previously been identified to promote primary tumor growth of other cancers, and a goal of this study was to define the importance of neutrophil oxidative burst in BM-PCa. To do this, we first examined the impact of depletion of reactive oxygen species (ROS), via systemic deletion of the main source of ROS in phagocytes, NADPH oxidase (Nox)2, which we found to suppress prostate tumor growth in bone. Further, using pharmacologic ROS inhibitors and Nox2-null neutrophils, we found that ROS depletion specifically suppresses growth of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells. Upon closer examination using bulk RNA sequencing analysis, we identified that metastatic prostate cancer induces neutrophil transcriptomic changes that activates pathways associated with response to oxidative stress. In tandem, prostate cancer cells resist neutrophil anti-tumor response via extracellular (i.e., regulation of neutrophils) and intracellular alterations of glutathione synthesis, the most potent cellular antioxidant. These findings demonstrate that BM-PCa thrive under oxidative stress conditions and such that regulation of ROS and glutathione programming could be leveraged for targeting of BM-PCa progression.""","""['Diane L Costanzo-Garvey', 'Adam J Case', 'Gabrielle F Watson', 'Massar Alsamraae', 'Arpita Chatterjee', 'Rebecca E Oberley-Deegan', 'Samikshan Dutta', 'Maher Y Abdalla', 'Tammy Kielian', 'Merry L Lindsey', 'Leah M Cook']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['Neutrophils are mediators of metastatic prostate cancer progression in bone.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Endostatin inhibits androgen-independent prostate cancer growth by suppressing nuclear receptor-mediated oxidative stress.', 'Neutrophils to the ROScue: Mechanisms of NADPH Oxidase Activation and Bacterial Resistance.', 'Oxidative stress in prostate cancer.', 'Relationship between 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) as Systemic Biomarker of Lipid Peroxidation and Metabolomic Profiling of Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'NRF2: A crucial regulator for mitochondrial metabolic shift and prostate cancer progression.']"""

We investigated the impact of a general practitioner (GP)-led follow-up program for prostate cancer (PCa) and renal cell cancer (RCC) survivors.  Methods:   This retrospective monocentric study compared standard urologist-led follow-up to experimental GP-led follow-up within a nurse-led network for PCa and RCC survivors. To assess the safe continuity of follow-up, the number of patients lost to follow-up (LFU) was collected. A microcosting analysis from the French national health system perspective was conducted to describe incremental costs associated with experimental follow-up. A satisfaction survey was conducted to determine participating patient's and GP's satisfaction scores, ranging from 0 to 4 and 0 to 5, respectively.  Results:   Among the 1274 patients included, 92/753 (12.2%) were LFU during standard follow-up vs 0/521 (0%) during experimental follow-up (p < 0.001). In the latter, the median management delay of suspected recurrence for PCa and RCC survivors was 20 [12-27] and 16 [10.5-31.25] days, and the mean incremental cost on a per-patient basis was 34.68 ± 105.87€ and 64.24 ± 93.55€, respectively. Patient and GP mean satisfaction scores were 3.6/4 and 3.9/5, respectively.  Conclusion:   The GP-led follow-up of PCa and RCC survivors within a nurse-led network seems to provide safe continuity of follow-up and seems not to be associated with major incremental costs.

Methods:   We estimated long-term (≥30-year) overall and cause-specific cumulative mortality for men diagnosed with prostate (n = 6873), lung and bronchus (n = 1290), colon and rectum (n = 1418), bladder (n = 1321), and melanoma (n = 2654) cancer in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study between 1986 and 2012 and women with breast (n = 18 280), lung and bronchus (n = 3963), colon and rectum (n = 3461), uterine corpus (n = 1641), and thyroid (n = 1103) cancer in the Nurses' Health Study between 1976 and 2012 and Nurses' Health Study II between 1989 and 2013.  Results:   We reported overall and cause-specific cumulative mortality of 30 years among men and 35 years among women. Among male cancer survivors, the 30-year cumulative cancer-specific mortality was 15.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14.4% to 16.4%) for prostate, 83.5% (95% CI = 81.2% to 85.5%) for lung and bronchus, 37.0% (95% CI = 34.4% to 39.5%) for colon and rectum, 22.5% (95% CI = 20.0% to 25.0%) for urinary bladder, and 8.0% (95% CI = 6.9% to 9.1%) for melanoma. Among female cancer survivors, the 35-year cumulative cancer-specific mortality rate was 20.6% (95% CI = 19.7% to 21.6%) for breast, 83.5% (95% CI = 81.6% to 85.2%) for lung and bronchus, 39.6% (95% CI = 37.5% to 41.6%) for colon and rectum, 16.6% (95% CI = 14.7% to 18.6%) for uterine corpus, and 3.2% (95% CI = 2.1% to 4.3%) for thyroid. Except for lung cancer, most patients with common cancer were more likely to die from causes other than primary cancers. We observed 2 basic trends for cumulative cancer-specific mortality. The first is a sustained but nevertheless excess risk: Prostate or breast cancer-specific cumulative mortality continued to increase after diagnosis from 5 to 30 years or longer. The second is greatly diminished risk of index cancer-specific mortality following diagnosis 10 years or longer previously. For example, colorectal cancer-specific mortality increased by less than 4 percentage points between 10 and 30 or 35 years after diagnosis, and this finding also applied to lung, bladder, melanoma, uterine corpus, and thyroid cancer.

However, as with any therapy, not all patients show a therapeutic benefit, and responses differ widely in magnitude and duration. In this study, we evaluated whether differences in the AR cistrome before treatment can distinguish between SPT-responding (R) and -nonresponding (NR) tumors. We provide the first preclinical evidence to our knowledge that SPT-R tumors exhibit a distinct AR cistrome when compared with SPT-NR tumors, indicating a differential biological role of the AR. We applied an integrated analysis of ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq to the pretreatment tumors and identified an SPT-R signature that distinguishes R and NR tumors. Because transcriptomes of SPT-treated clinical specimens are not available, we interrogated available castration-resistant PC (CRPC) transcriptomes and showed that the SPT-R signature is associated with improved survival and has the potential to identify patients who would respond to SPT.

Recently, 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification has attracted more attention as a new layer of RNA post-transcriptional regulation. Hence, we aimed at investigating the potential roles of m5C modification regulators in the BCR of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD).  Methods:   CNV data, mutation annotation data, mRNA expression profiles, and clinical data were downloaded from TCGA and GEO databases. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis, log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox regression, and time-dependent ROC curves analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic factors. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to validate the distinction between subgroups. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) was used to investigate the underlying pathways associated with m5C modification patterns. Single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was utilized to assess the infiltration of distinct immune cells. Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) prediction was carried out to assess the potential response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. The m5C modification signature was constructed via LASSO Cox's proportional hazards regression method.  Results:   After comprehensively analyzing various types of data from TCGA dataset, and exploring the differential expression and prognostic value of each m5C regulator, we identified m5C modification patterns based on 17 m5C regulators. Two patterns presented a significant difference in the risk of BCR, the tumor microenvironment (TME), and immunotherapy response in PRAD. We found that TET2, which was highly expressed in adjacent normal tissues compared to tumor tissues, was closely associated with many infiltrating immune cells. The m5C modification signature was constructed for the clinical application. Risk score calculated by m5C signature was associated with T stage, N stage, Gleason score, and the possibility of BCR (HR, 4.197; 95% CI, 3.016-5.842; p < 0.001). A higher risk score also represented the possibility of immunotherapy response. Finally, the potential roles of m5C modification signature were validated in the testing dataset.  Conclusions:   Our study revealed the potential roles of m5C modification in the PRAD BCR and TME diversity, which may provide new insight into the field of prostate cancer in future research.""","""['Zhipeng Xu', 'Shuqiu Chen', 'Yuxi Zhang', 'Ruiji Liu', 'Ming Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['Comprehensive Analysis of m5C Methylation Regulatory Genes and Tumor Microenvironment in Prostate Cancer.', '5-methylcytosine RNA methylation regulators affect prognosis and tumor microenvironment in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification and characterization of nucleotide metabolism and neuroendocrine regulation-associated modification patterns in stomach adenocarcinoma with auxiliary prognostic assessment and immunotherapy response prediction.', 'Emerging Role of RNA m5C Modification in Cardiovascular Diseases.', 'Vital roles of m5C RNA modification in cancer and immune cell biology.', 'Epigenetic regulation in the tumor microenvironment: molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'A machine learning framework develops a DNA replication stress model for predicting clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerability in primary prostate cancer.', 'm5C regulator-mediated modification patterns and tumor microenvironment infiltration characterization in colorectal cancer: One step closer to precision medicine.']"""

Quantitative and multiplexed anti-CTA detection arrays can assess the immune status in tumors and monitor therapy-induced antitumor immune reactions. Most full-length recombinant CTA proteins tend to aggregate. Cysteine residue-specific S-cationization techniques facilitate the preparation of water-soluble and full-length CTAs. Combined with Luminex technology, we designed a multiple S-cationized antigen-immobilized bead array (MUSCAT) assay system to evaluate multiple serum antibodies to CTAs. Reducible S-alkyl-disulfide-cationized antigens in cytosolic conditions were employed to develop rabbit polyclonal antibodies as positive controls. These control antibodies sensitively detected immobilized antigens on beads and endogenous antigens in human lung cancer-derived cell lines. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies successfully confirmed the dynamic ranges and quantitative MUSCAT assay results. An immune monitoring study was conducted using the serum samples on an adenovirus-mediated REIC/Dkk-3 gene therapy clinical trial that showed a successful clinical response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Autoantibody responses were closely related to clinical outcomes. Notably, upregulation of anti-CTA responses was monitored before tumor regression. Thus, quantitative monitoring of anti-CTA antibody biomarkers can be used to evaluate the cancer-immunity cycle. A quality-certified serum autoantibody monitoring system is a powerful tool for developing and evaluating cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Ai Miyamoto', 'Tomoko Honjo', 'Mirei Masui', 'Rie Kinoshita', 'Hiromi Kumon', 'Kazuhiro Kakimi', 'Junichiro Futami']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Sensitive Multiplexed Quantitative Analysis of Autoantibodies to Cancer Antigens with Chemically S-Cationized Full-Length and Water-Soluble Denatured Proteins.', 'Detection of autoantibodies against cancer-testis antigens in non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Oncogenic cancer/testis antigens are a hallmarker of cancer and a sensible target for cancer immunotherapy.', 'Cancer/Testis Antigens: Expression, Regulation, Tumor Invasion, and Use in Immunotherapy of Cancers.', 'Rapid detection of antibodies in sera using multiplexed self-assembling bead arrays.', 'Cancer testis antigen subfamilies: Attractive targets for therapeutic vaccine (Review).', 'Dickkopf-3: An Update on a Potential Regulator of the Tumor Microenvironment.']"""

This study examined the rest and the activity paradigm among people with cancer based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB).  Methods:   A cross-sectional survey was completed by N = 1244 people (58% women; M = 59.95 years) with breast, prostate and colorectal cancer, including 15 items on rest and activity attitudes. To explain the intention to engage in PA, hierarchical regression analyses were calculated.  Results:   The two-dimensional structure of attitudes (rest and activity) was confirmed. The agreement with the activity paradigm (M = 4.11; SD = 0.78) was higher compared to the rest paradigm (M = 2.56; SD = 0.78, p < .001). The TPB was an appropriate model to explain the intention to engage in PA (R2 = .59), showing that the activity paradigm, but not the rest paradigm, was significantly associated with participants' intention for PA.  Conclusion:   Results indicate that the paradigm shift has successfully reached attitudes of people with cancer. Interventions focusing on the benefits of PA rather than addressing rest cognitions promise higher effectiveness in affecting PA levels.

Therefore, it is urgent to discover potential novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can potentially facilitate the development of efficient anticancer strategies.  Methods:   A series of functional in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to evaluate the biological behaviors of PCa cells. RNA pulldown, Western blot, luciferase reporter, immunohistochemistry and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were applied to dissect the detailed underlying mechanisms. High-throughput sequencing was performed to screen for differentially expressed circRNAs in PCa and adjacent normal tissues.  Results:   Upregulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) is associated with poor progression-free survival and the activation of multiple signaling pathways in PCa. PRMT5 inhibits the transcription of CAMK2N1 by depositing the repressive histone marks H4R3me2s and H3R8me2s on the proximal promoter region of CAMK2N1, and results in malignant progression of PCa both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the expression of circSPON2, a candidate circRNA in PCa tissues identified by RNA-seq, was found to be associated with poor clinical outcomes in PCa patients. Further results showed that circSPON2 induced PCa cell proliferation and migration, and that the circSPON2-induced effects were counteracted by miR-331-3p. Particularly, circSPON2 acted as a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-331-3p to attenuate the repressive effects of miR-331-3p on its downstream target PRMT5.  Conclusions:   Our findings showed that the epigenetic regulator PRMT5 aggravates PCa progression by inhibiting the transcription of CAMK2N1 and is modulated by the circSPON2/miR-331-3p axis, which may serve as a potential therapeutic target for patients with aggressive PCa.""","""['Bing Yao#', 'Sha Zhu#', 'Xiyi Wei#', 'Ming-Kun Chen#', 'Yangkun Feng', 'Zhimin Li', 'Xinyu Xu', 'Yuwei Zhang', 'Yang Wang', 'Jingwan Zhou', 'Ningyuan Tang', 'Chengjian Ji', 'Peng Jiang', 'Shan-Chao Zhao', 'Chao Qin', 'Ninghan Feng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['Circ-PRMT5 promotes breast cancer by the miR-509-3p/TCF7L2 axis activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'Circ-PRMT5 enhances the proliferation, migration and glycolysis of hepatoma cells by targeting miR-188-5p/HK2 axis.', 'PRMT5 functionally associates with EZH2 to promote colorectal cancer progression through epigenetically repressing CDKN2B expression.', 'PRMT5: a putative oncogene and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.', 'Functions and mechanisms of N6‑methyladenosine in prostate cancer (Review).', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'CircRNAs regulate the crosstalk between inflammation and tumorigenesis: The bilateral association and molecular mechanisms.']"""

Internal pudendal arteries, corpora cavernosa, and penile bulb sparing can generally be achieved in all patients, but NVB sparing can be challenging due to its proximity to the prostate and is therefore dependent on tumor location. PCa patients that have sufficient erectile function at baseline and favorable tumor characteristics might benefit from this treatment. Currently, it is unclear what proportion of patients are eligible for neurovascular-sparing treatment and to what extent this is technically feasible.  Aim:   To define the eligibility and technical feasibility for neurovascular-sparing MRgRT in intermediate-risk localized PCa patients.  Methods:   A consecutive series of men that received 5 × 7.25 gray (Gy) MRgRT for localized PCa were included. Baseline erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 questionnaire. Additionally, the ability of sparing the neurovascular bundles was assessed in all patients. Per neurovascular-sparing protocol, the dominant intraprostatic lesion with a 4 mm isotropic margin should receive 34.44 Gy in ≥ 99% of the volume (i.e., high-dose area). When the high-dose area directly borders or overlaps the NVB because of a dorsolateral position of the dominant intraprostatic lesion, sparing of the NVB was considered not feasible on that side.  Outcomes:   Patient-reported IIEF-5 baseline questionnaires and the technical feasibility of NVB sparing were assessed.  Results:   Of the 102 men that completed the IIEF-5 questionnaire at baseline, 49.0% of patients reported to have an IIEF-5 score of ≥ 17. In those patients, the NVB could technically have been spared bilaterally in 20.0% and unilaterally in 68.0%.  Clinical implications:   Our findings define the potential population for neurovascular-sparing MRgRT for localized PCa and indicate the proportion in which the NVB can technically be spared.  Strength & limitations:   The major strength of this study is the prospective collection of data. The limitations include that the neurovascular-sparing feasibility definition is based on pre-clinical planning data.  Conclusion:   A substantial group of 49.0% of patients in our study had mild or no erectile dysfunction at baseline. Of these patients, the NVB could technically have been spared bilaterally in 20.0% and unilaterally in 68.0% during MRgRT. Trials need to assess the effect of neurovascular-sparing MRgRT on erectile function.

The aim of this study was to analyze whether long-term oncologic outcomes differ between MRI-detectable and MRI-occult csPC.  Patients and methods:   Retrospective analysis of 1449 patients with pre-prostatectomy MRI and csPC on prostatectomy specimens (ie, Grade group ≥2 or extraprostatic spread) between 2001-2006. T2-weighted MRIs were classified according to the Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System into MRI-occult (categories 1, 2), MRI-equivocal (category 3), and MRI-detectable (categories 4, 5). Cumulative incidence of biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastatic disease, and cancer-specific mortality, estimated with competing risk models. The median follow-up in survivors was 11.0 years (IQR: 8.9-13.1).  Results:   In 188 (13%) cases, csPC was MRI-occult, 435 (30%) MRIs were equivocal, and 826 (57%) csPC were MRI-detectable. The 15-year cumulative incidence [95% CI] of BCR was 8.3% [2.2, 19.5] for MRI-occult cases, 17.4% [11.1, 24.8] for MRI-equivocal cases, and 43.3% [38.7, 47.8] for MRI-detectable cases (P < .001). The cumulative incidences of metastases were 0.61% [0.06, 3.1], 3.5% [1.5, 6.9], and 19.6% [15.4, 24.2] for MRI-occult, MRI-equivocal, and MRI-detectable cases, respectively (P < .001). There were no deaths from prostate cancer observed in patients with MRI-occult csPC, compared to an estimated 1.9% [0.54, 4.9], and 7.1 % [4.5, 10.6] for patients with MRI-equivocal and MRI-detectable cancer, respectively (P < .001).  Conclusion:   Oncologic outcomes after prostatectomy for csPC differ between MRI-occult and MRI-detectable lesions. Judging the clinical significance of a negative prostate MRI based on histopathologic surrogates alone might be misleading.  Microabstract:   Among 1449 patients with pre-prostatectomy MRI and clinically significant prostate cancer on prostatectomy histopathology, MRI-occult cancers (n = 188, 13%) were less likely to recur biochemically (8% vs. 43%, P < .001), metastasize (0.6% vs. 20%, P < .001), or lead to prostate cancer mortality (0% vs. 7%, P < .001) than MRI-detectable cancers (n = 826, 57%). MRI-occult cancers constitute a prognostically distinct subgroup among higher-grade prostate cancers.""","""['Andreas G Wibmer', 'Robert A Lefkowitz', 'Yulia Lakhman', 'Joshua Chaim', 'Ines Nikolovski', 'Evis Sala', 'Samson W Fine', 'Timothy F Donahue', 'Michael W Kattan', 'Hedvig Hricak', 'Hebert Alberto Vargas']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Local Extent of Prostate Cancer at MRI versus Prostatectomy Histopathology: Associations with Long-term Oncologic Outcomes.', 'Prognostic Implications of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Concomitant Systematic Biopsy in Predicting Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy in Prostate Cancer Patients Diagnosed with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Biopsy.', 'Biparametric Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version2 and International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Predict Biochemical Recurrence after Radical\xa0Prostatectomy.', 'Pathological and 3 Tesla Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Correlation with Whole Mount Histopathology.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Local Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR): International Consensus -based Guidelines on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Recurrence after Radiation Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Novel radiomic analysis on bi-parametric MRI for characterizing differences between MR non-visible and visible clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'PI-RADS: Where Next?']"""

Patients and method:   SCORAD is a randomised trial of 686 patients comparing a single dose of 8 Gy radiotherapy with 20 Gy in 5 fractions. Data was split into a training set (412, 60%) and a validation set (274, 40%). A multivariable Cox regression for overall survival (OS) and a logistic regression for ambulatory status at 8 weeks were performed in the training set using baseline factors and a backward selection regression to identify a parsimonious model with p ≤ 0.10. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis evaluated model prognostic performance in the validation set. Validation of the final survival model was performed in a separate registry dataset (n = 348).  Results:   The survival Cox model identified male gender, lung, gastrointestinal, and other types of cancer, compression at C1-T12, presence of non-skeletal metastases and poor ambulatory status all significantly associated with worse OS (all p < 0.05). The ROC AUC for the selected model was 75% (95%CI: 69-81) in the SCORAD validation set and 68% (95%CI: 62-74) in the external validation registry data. The logistic model for ambulatory outcome identified primary tumour breast or prostate, ambulatory status grade 1 or 2, bladder function normal and prior chemotherapy all significantly associated with increased odds of ambulation at 8 weeks (all p < 0.05). The ROC AUC for the selected model was 72.3% (95% CI 62.6-82.0) in the validation set.

We report price change patterns from 2015 to 2019 for several oral anticancer medications for common solid tumor malignancies.  Methods:   We collected provider utilization and payment data from the public Medicare Part D database and extracted drug price information for commonly prescribed targeted oral anticancer agents for lung, breast, and prostate cancer. We then calculated median Pearson correlation coefficient values for various drugs (containing more than two data points) within each therapeutic class. We also calculated compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) for medication costs within each class and compared them with the consumer price index (CPI).  Results:   Our study included six epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRi; one generic), five anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors (ALKi), two B-Raf inhibitors (BRAFi), three hormonal agents (one generic), three cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), two poly-ADP-ribose inhibitors (PARPi), and seven antiandrogen agents (two generic). The median (range) Pearson correlation coefficient values for cost of drugs within each therapeutic class were 0.967 (0.915-0.978) for EGFRi, 0.981 (0.966-0.989) for ALKi, 0.996 for BRAFi, 0.994 (0.992-0.999) for CDK4/6i, 0.855 for PARPi, and 0.442 (-0.522 to 0.962) for antiandrogens. Therapies with two or fewer data points (generic erlotinib, dacomitinib, abiraterone, apalutamide, and darolutamide) were excluded. The median CAGRs in costs over the 5-year period were 4.56% (EGFRi), 6.40% (ALKi), 2.58% (BRAFi), 5.48% (hormonal agents), 5.21% (CDK4/6i), 27.29% (PARPi), and 34.8% (antiandrogens). The CPI over 5 years was 2.26%/year, and the average inflation rate was 1.90%/year.

However, the underlying mechanisms of lncRNA MNX1 Antisense RNA 1 (MNX1‑AS1) in prostate cancer has not been explored. Therefore, the present study aimed to explore the function of MNX1‑AS1 in prostate cancer tumorigenesis and investigate the in‑depth mechanism. The expression of MNX1‑AS1, microRNA (miR)‑2113 and murine double min 2 (MDM2) in prostate cancer tissues and corresponding normal tissues were assessed by reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR. The protein expression levels of MDM2 were detected by western blotting. LNCaP and PC‑3 cells were transfected with short hairpin (sh)‑MNX1‑AS1, miR‑2113 mimics, miR‑2113 inhibitor and pCDH‑MDM2 vector using Lipofectamine® 3000. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion abilities were assessed by CCK‑8 assay, colony formation and Transwell assay, respectively. Dual luciferase reporter assay was carried out to confirm the putative targets of MNX1‑AS1 and miR‑2113. Tumor formation experiment in nude mice was applied to evaluate the tumor growth effect of MNX1‑AS1 in vivo. The expression of MNX1‑AS1 was significantly upregulated in the prostate cancer tissues and cell lines. MNX1‑AS1 knockdown suppressed the abilities of cell viability and migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo.

However, broad eligibility criteria allowed entry of a heterogeneous participant group, including those with prior ADT exposure, raising concerns about subsequent androgen sensitivity. For these reasons, we completed previously specified subgroup analyses to assess if prior ADT was associated with ADT timing efficacy after PSA relapse.  Methods:   We examined TOAD trial patient-level data for participants with PSA relapse after local therapy. We performed Kaplan-Meier analyses for overall survival stratified by prior ADT and randomized treatment arm (immediate or delayed ADT). We compared group characteristics using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher exact tests. All hypothesis tests were 2-sided.  Results:   We identified 261 patients with PSA relapse, 125 of whom received prior ADT. Patients with prior ADT had higher PSA at presentation (12.1 vs 9.0 ng/mL; P < .001), more cT3 disease (38.4% vs 25.0%; P = .007), and more likely received radiotherapy as local treatment (80.0% vs 47.8%; P < .001) but were otherwise similar to patients without prior ADT exposure. Within this prior ADT group, those who received immediate ADT (n = 56) had improved overall survival compared with those who received delayed ADT (n = 69; P = .02). This benefit was not observed in the group with no prior ADT (P = .98).  Conclusions:   The survival benefit demonstrated in the TOAD trial may be driven by patients who received ADT prior to trial entry. We provide possible explanations for this finding with implications for treatment of PSA-relapsed prostate cancer and future study planning.""","""['Kristian D Stensland', 'Theresa Devasia', 'Megan E V Caram', 'Christina Chapman', 'Alexander Zaslavsky', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Brent K Hollenbeck', 'Jordan B Sparks', 'Jennifer Burns', 'Varsha Vedapudi', 'Gillian M Duchesne', 'Alexander Tsodikov', 'Ted A Skolarus']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JNCI Cancer Spectr""","""['Timing of androgen-deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer with a rising PSA (TROG 03.06 and VCOG PR 01-03 TOAD): a randomised, multicentre, non-blinded, phase 3 trial.', 'Optimal PSA Threshold for Androgen-Deprivation Therapy in Patients with Prostate Cancer following Radical Prostatectomy and Adjuvant Radiation Therapy.', 'Immediate versus deferred initiation of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients with PSA-only relapse.

Antioxidant efficacy of the red biopigment determined using 2,2 diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid, and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays was found to be 53.16%, 86.27%, and 13.83%, respectively. In addition, expression studies of target gene superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD-2) showed that increasing concentrations (10-50 μg/ml) of the biopigment enhanced its expression from 0.91- to 1.905-fold. An inhibitory effect of 0.424-0.627-fold was observed in the expression of glutathione peroxidase (GPX) with a similar increase in biopigment concentration. Addition of quercetin (positive control) at 50 μg/ml led to 0.295-fold decrease in GPX expression. In contrast, the expression of SOD-2 increased by 1.026-fold in the presence of quercetin. The biopigment also showed an increased serological IL-10 expression (an anti-inflammatory agent) ranging from 1034.58 to 4657.89 pg/ml. Treatment of LNCaP cells with the red biopigment (10-100 μg/ml) resulted in significant (p < .05) reduction (upto 79.86%) in viability and 51.79%-89.86% reduction in cell metabolic activity. Fluorescent microscopy examination of red biopigment-treated cells showed significant inhibition of normal cellular morphology including condensed nuclei, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic bodies, thus confirming its cytotoxic potential. Results of this study revealed that the red biopigment has the potential to modulate the expression of antioxidative and anti-inflammatory markers in addition to being cytotoxic to the LNCaP cancer cells. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: These findings indicate that cell treatment with red biopigment has the potential to modulate anti-oxidative, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes for therapeutic effects, which is further enhanced by its cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. Considering these cell-based observations, Monascus red biopigment has ample potential as a useful supplement to formulate therapeutic products that delay the development of inflammatory-related diseases and associated complications.""","""['Vishu Chaudhary', 'Priya Katyal', 'Harsh Panwar', 'Jaspreet Kaur', 'Rotimi E Aluko', 'Anil Kumar Puniya', 'Anuj Kumar Poonia']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Food Biochem""","""['Growth kinetics of biopigment production by Thai isolated Monascus purpureus in a stirred tank bioreactor.', 'Enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of Monascus pilosus fermented products by addition of turmeric to the medium.', ""The ameliorative effect of Monascus purpureus NTU 568-fermented rice extracts on 6-hydroxydopamine-induced neurotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and the rat model of Parkinson's disease."", 'Protection of Monascus-fermented dioscorea against DMBA-induced oral injury in hamster by anti-inflammatory and antioxidative potentials.', 'Natural pigment from Monascus: The production and therapeutic significance.', 'Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant Properties of β-Sitosterol in Copper Sulfate-Induced Inflammation in Zebrafish (Danio rerio).']"""

An imbalance of ROS and antioxidant levels gives rise to a condition called oxidative stress. High levels of ROS in the male reproductive tract can interfere with its normal functioning and can even pose as toxic to the sperm, inhibiting sperm functioning (including motility) and metabolism. Oxidative stress resulting from ROS and lipid peroxidation is one of the major causes of male infertility including infertility in varicocele patients. These may cause DNA and peroxidative damage and apoptosis. Production of ROS in excess also leads to erectile dysfunction (ED). In recent years, studies have also linked oxidative stress with the development, progress, and therapy response of prostate cancer patients.

However, FH of other HBOC-related cancers, such as prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancer (malignant melanoma), is often overlooked.  Methods:   Among 945 patients who received genetic testing of BRCA1/2 at our hospital between October 2010 and September 2021, we compared the FH of 123 patients diagnosed with HBOC and 669 other patients who had breast cancer and had a documented FH. This study focused on the FH of HBOC-related cancers such as breast, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancer, as well as colorectal, gastric, liver, lung, and uterine cancers, which are common among Japanese, and other cancers.  Results:   FH of prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancer was significantly higher in the BRCA2 pathogenic variant (PV) cases than in the wild-type (WT) cases. The mean number of family members are as follows: BRCA1 PV/ BRCA2 PV/ WT; prostate cancer: 0.05/ 0.34/ 0.09 (P < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparisons test), pancreatic cancer: 0.13/ 0.21/ 0.10 (P = 0.01637), and skin cancer: 0.03/ 0.07/ 0.01 (P = 0.00129), respectively.  Conclusions:   When considering BRCA1/2 genetic testing, FH of prostate, pancreatic, and skin cancers may also be examined as HBOC-related cancers to provide testing for patients who would benefit from it.

We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis to estimate the association of comorbidity on procedure complication. Our primary outcome was the incidence of major or moderate complications.  Results:   Features associated with high-risk complication included older age (OR = 1.03 per year, P = .001), history of coronary artery disease (OR = 1.40, P = .03), history of diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.41, P < .001, current smoking status (OR = 1.46, P ≤ .001), surgical biopsy (OR = 7.39, P < .001), needle biopsy (OR = 1.94, P < .001), and other invasive procedure (OR = 1.58, P < .001).

The ideal radiotherapy treatment approach for UIR-PCa has not been well-defined. We hypothesized that EBRT+BT±ADT is associated with improved overall survival (OS) relative to EBRT±ADT in men with UIR-PCa.  Materials and methods:   The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to retrospectively identify 32,246 men diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 with UIR-PCa who received EBRT (n = 13,265), EBRT+ADT (n = 13,123), EBRT+BT (n = 3440), or EBRT+BT+ADT (n = 2418). OS was the primary outcome. Inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to adjust for covariable imbalances and weight-adjusted multivariable analysis using Cox regression modeling was used to compare OS hazard ratios.  Results:   Median follow-up was 60 months (range: 3-168 months). EBRT+ADT correlated with improved OS relative to EBRT alone on multivariable analysis (Hazard Ratio (HR): 0.92, [95% Confidence Interval: 0.87-0.98], p = 0.005). Compared to EBRT+ADT, EBRT+BT (HR: 0.77 [0.69-0.85], p = 3 × 10-7) and EBRT+BT+ADT (HR: 0.75 [0.67-0.83], p = 6 × 10-8) were associated with improved OS. Eight-years OS for the EBRT+ADT versus EBRT+BT+ADT was 70% and 78% (p < 0.0001), which is similar to historical clinical trials (ASCENDE-RT 9-year OS: 74% vs. 78%, p = 0.29). Relative to EBRT+BT, EBRT+BT+ADT was not associated with improved OS (HR: 0.99 [0.87-1.11], p = 0.82).  Conclusions:   In a large retrospective cohort, the addition of brachytherapy to EBRT correlated with improved survival in men with UIR-PCa.

In this study, we compared patients who were treated with ARTA with those who received only vintage hormone therapy including docetaxel after clinical recurrence.  Results:   In the mHSPC group, 69 patients became mCRPC and were treated with or without ARTAs.

This study aimed to identify patients who could benefit from the sequential use of enzalutamide after abiraterone use.  Patients and methods:   We included 70 patients with mCRPC who received enzalutamide sequentially following abiraterone treatment. Decline in the prostatespecific antigen (PSA) levels at 4 weeks after enzalutamide initiation and the association between decline in PSA levels and survival were analyzed.  Results:   Sixteen men (22.9%) achieved a decline of >50% in PSA levels after 4 weeks of enzalutamide administration. Overall survival (OS) after enzalutamide among men with >50% decline at 4 weeks was significantly better than that among men with a PSA decline <50% (not reached vs. 34 months, p=0.008). OS after first-line abiraterone treatment for men with PSA decline >50% and <50% was not reached and 46 months, respectively (p=0.007). A PSA decline of >50% at 4 weeks of enzalutamide administration was an independent predictor of longer OS.  Conclusion:   A PSA decline of >50% at 4 weeks after the start of sequential enzalutamide treatment following abiraterone treatment predicted long-term survival in patients with mCRPC. Early PSA decline can identify patients who benefit from second-line enzalutamide after abiraterone treatment and can be useful as a decision-making tool regarding treatment.""","""['Naohiro Fujimoto', 'Akinori Minato', 'Tsukasa Igawa', 'Tasuku Hiroshige', 'Wataru Obara', 'Atsushi Fukuda', 'Yujiro Nagata', 'Yui Mizushima', 'Ikko Tomisaki', 'Kenichi Harada']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Antitumour activity of enzalutamide (MDV3100) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) pre-treated with docetaxel and abiraterone.', 'Enzalutamide Antitumour Activity Against Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Previously Treated with Docetaxel and Abiraterone: A Multicentre Analysis.', 'Clinical activity of enzalutamide versus docetaxel in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after abiraterone.', 'Systematic Review of Efficacy and Health Economic Implications of Real-world Treatment Sequencing in Prostate Cancer: Where Do the Newer Agents Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Fit in?', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?']"""

The present monocentric, retrospective study aimed to investigate the best PSA value at which to plan salvage RT for patients with recurrent prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   From January 2011 to December 2019, 158 patients were treated with adjuvant RT at Pisa University Hospital, whilst 91 patients underwent salvage RT. We grouped the patients treated with salvage RT using their PSA values at the time of salvage RT: PSA >0.5 ng/ml, PSA between 0 and 0.5 ng/ml, and PSA ≤0.2 ng/ml. The median follow-up was 63 months. Biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) measured from surgery was the primary endpoint.  Results:   Salvage RT led to shorter BFS compared to adjuvant RT considering the whole cohort of patients, with a hazard ratio of 3.195 (95% confidence interval=1.534-6.655, p=0.002).

Members of the elongation of the very-long-chain fatty acid (ELOVL) gene family have been reported to participate in the occurrence and development of various cancers. However, the function of ELOVL gene family members (ELOVLs) in prostate cancer has not been fully elucidated.  Methods:   The mRNA expression and prognostic value of ELOVLs in prostate cancer were analyzed using the GEPIA database. The Oncomine database and PrognoScan database were used to further verify the mRNA expression level and prognostic value of ELOVL2 in prostate cancer. RT-qPCR and Western blotting were used to validate the expression levels of ELOVL2 in four prostate cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the ELOVL2 protein expression levels in prostate cancer tissues. Coexpression analysis in the cBioPortal database and enrichment analysis in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), CCK8, colony formation, and transwell assays were used to identify the functions and mechanisms of ELOVL2.  Results:   ELOVL2 expression was upregulated in prostate cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. High expression of ELOVL2 indicated a better prognosis in prostate cancer patients. ELOVL2 expression was negatively correlated with Gleason score. Knockdown of ELOVL2 promoted cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and the growth of subcutaneous xenografts and activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway by downregulating INPP4B, while overexpression of ELOVL2 reversed these effects. In addition, overexpression of INPP4B blocked the promoting effect of sh-ELOVL2 on cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

With the development of medical imaging technology, magnetic resonance images (MRI) have been used in the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer because of its clarity and non-invasiveness. Prostate MRI segmentation and diagnosis experience problems such as low tissue boundary contrast. The traditional segmentation method of manually drawing the contour boundary of the tissue cannot meet the clinical real-time requirements. How to quickly and accurately segment the prostate tumor has become an important research topic.  Methods:   This paper proposes a prostate tumor diagnosis based on the deep learning network PSP-Net+VGG16. The deep convolutional neural network segmentation method based on the PSP-Net constructs a atrous convolution residual structure model extraction network. First, the three-dimensional prostate MRI is converted to two-dimensional image slices, and then the slice input of the two-dimensional image is trained based on the PSP-Net neural network; and the VGG16 network is used to analyze the region of interest and classify prostate cancer and normal prostate.  Results:   According to the experimental results, the segmentation method based on the deep learning network PSP-Net is used to identify the data set samples. The segmentation accuracy is close to the Dice similarity coefficient and Hausdorff distance, and even exceeds the traditional prostate image segmentation method. The Dice index reached 91.3%, and the technique is superior in speed of processing. The predicted tumor markers are very close to the actual markers manually by clinicians; the classification accuracy and recognition rates of prostate MRI based on VGG16 are as high as 87.95% and 87.33%, and the accuracy rate and recall rate of the network model are relatively balanced. The area under curve index is also higher than other models, with good generalization ability.  Conclusion:   Experiments show that prostate cancer diagnosis based on the deep learning network PSP-Net+VGG16 is superior in accuracy and processing time compared to other algorithms, and can be well applied to clinical prostate tumor diagnosis.""","""['Li-Yin Ye', 'Xiao-Yan Miao', 'Wan-Song Cai', 'Wan-Jiang Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['PSP net-based automatic segmentation network model for prostate magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Fast interactive medical image segmentation with weakly supervised deep learning method.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Review on Deep Learning Methodologies in Medical Image Restoration and Segmentation.', 'A state-of-the-art technique to perform cloud-based semantic segmentation using deep learning 3D U-Net architecture.']"""

At the time of detection of the primary tumor, approximately 75% of patients have no invasion into the muscularis layer (non-muscle-invasive carcinoma), with tumor growth limited to the basal membrane (stage Ta) or submucosal base (stage T1). Removal of the tumor in a «unified block» (laser en-bloc resection or L-ERBT), unlike routine transurethral resection, allows to obtain qualitative biopsy material for precise pathomorphological staging of the tumor process. In order to accurately stratify a patient into one or another risk group, verification of the following morphological parameters is required: degree of tumor differentiation and its malignancy, depth of invasion, foci of carcinoma in situ at resection margins, presence or absence of lymphovascular invasion. Identification of tumor variant histology is also recommended. Information on presence or absence of detrusor elements in the specimen is necessary in the morphological report, as this parameter is considered as a criterion of radically performed tumor removal. According to ICCR recommendations (International Collaboration on cancer reporting), it is recommended to use subclassification of T1 stage using all possible criteria: volume and/or depth of invasion (assessed in mm), and/or width of invasion «spot» (assessed in mm), and/or involvement of anatomical structure - muscularis mucosae. Full morphological examination of the material obtained during the primary resection of the tumor is an important step in the diagnosis and treatment of bladder cancer, as it allows to stratify the patient into one or another risk group and, accordingly, allows to develop a personalized postoperative management.""","""['L O Severgina', 'D A Kislyakov', 'I A Korovin', 'N I Sorokin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Arkh Patol""","""['Novel approaches for transurethral en-bloc resection of large bladder tumors.', 'Green-light laser en bloc resection versus conventional transurethral resection for initial non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A randomized controlled trial.', 'Vertical Lamina Propria Invasion Diagnosed by En Bloc Transurethral Resection is a Significant Predictor of Progression for pT1 Bladder Cancer.', 'Current Evidence of Transurethral En-bloc Resection of Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer.', 'En bloc resection for nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer: review of the recent literature.']"""

Methods:   Deaths related to prostate (PCa), bladder (BCa), kidney (KC), penile (PeC), and testis (TCa) cancers from 1996 to 2019 were retrieved from the Mortality Information System database (Brazil). Geographic and temporal patterns were analyzed using age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs). A joinpoint regression model was used to identify changes in the trends and calculate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) for each region.  Results:   In Brazil, the ASMRs (per 100,000 persons/year) were 11.76 for PCa; 1.37, BCa; 1.13, KC; 0.33, and PeC; 0.26, TCa over the period. Increasing mortality trends were registered for BCa (AAPC = 0.45 in men; 0.57 in women), KC (AAPC = 2.03 in men), PeC (AAPC = 1.01), and TCa (AAPC = 2.06). The PCa mortality presented a significant reduction after 2006. The Northeast and North regions showed the highest increases in the PCa mortality. The South registered the highest ASMRs for BCa and KC, but the highest increasing trends occurred in the men from the Northeast. The North presented the highest ASMR for PeC, while the South registered the highest ASMR for TCa.

The patient was admitted to intensive care unit due to persistent hypotension despite fluid restoration. He received a single-unit blood transfusion and had a good response to vasopressors. Abdominal pain decreased. He was finally discharged with stable hematocrit 48hours after admission. Clinical management with no surgery or radiologic angio-embolization was required.

DNA samples of the control group consisted of 111 men, volunteers, without PC (age-matched to study group). Sanger sequencing, AS-PCR, RFLP-PCR, and multiplex-PCR were used for variants detection.Results: The percentage of men with ≥1 germline variant was higher in PC group (52.7%) than in healthy men (37.8%) (P = .03). The presence of ≥2 variants was associated with shorter survival than the presence of one or no variant in the PC group (P = .14, trend).

The mechanism of bone metastasis is complex and not fully clarified. By RNA sequencing and analysing key pathways in bone metastases of PCa, we found that one of the most important characteristics during PCa bone metastasis was G1/S transition acceleration caused by low protein levels of p16INK4a (p16). Interestingly, we demonstrated that UBE2S bound and degraded p16 through K11- rather than K48- or K63-linked ubiquitination, which accelerated PCa tumour cell G1/S transition in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, UBE2S also stabilized β-catenin through K11-linked ubiquitination, leading to enhanced migration and invasion of tumour cells in PCa bone metastasis. Based on our cohorts and public databases, UBE2S was overexpressed in bone metastases and positively correlated with a high Gleason score, advanced nodal metastasis status and poor prognosis in PCa. Finally, targeting UBE2S with cephalomannine inhibited proliferation and invasion in vitro, and bone metastasis of PCa in vivo.

Many pharmacological investigations have shown that numerous herbal substances possess anticancer action. Amygdalin (AMD) has antitumour capabilities and works as an antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immune-regulating characteristics. The anticancer effects of amygdalin and its metabolizing enzymes, rhodanese (RHD) and betaglucosidase (BGD), were examined in vivo, as well as their antitumour processes. Novel, effective combination agents are necessary to increase existing cancer treatment rates. This research was aimed at determining the anticarcinogenic impact of amygdalin (AMD) in vivo. This research was aimed at determining the RHD and BGD on the anticarcinogenic impact of AMD in vivo. Subcutaneously, PC3 prostate cancer cell lines were implanted into nude mice. Mice were treated every day with 0.5 ml of 50 mg/ml (AMD), AMD+ (RHD 0.1 mg/ml), AMD+(BGD 0.1 mg/ml), and doxorubicin (DOX 50 mg/ml). Mice were normalized for negative control with untreated mice. In in vivo, morphopathological alterations in the tumour tissue were analyzed by histopathological staining methods. After 35 days of therapy, tumour growth and size inhibition were evident, indicating a function for the metabolic enzymes BGD and RHD in regulating AMD's anticancer effect in vivo.

Previous high-order 3D chromatin assays either measure distant interactions across the genome or proximal interactions at selected targets. To address this gap, we developed Pore-C, which combines chromatin conformation capture with nanopore sequencing of concatemers to profile proximal high-order chromatin contacts at the genome scale. We also developed the statistical method Chromunity to identify sets of genomic loci with frequencies of high-order contacts significantly higher than background ('synergies'). Applying these methods to human cell lines, we found that synergies were enriched in enhancers and promoters in active chromatin and in highly transcribed and lineage-defining genes. In prostate cancer cells, these included binding sites of androgen-driven transcription factors and the promoters of androgen-regulated genes. Concatemers of high-order contacts in highly expressed genes were demethylated relative to pairwise contacts at the same loci. Synergies in breast cancer cells were associated with tyfonas, a class of complex DNA amplicons. These results rigorously link genome-wide high-order 3D interactions to lineage-defining transcriptional programs and establish Pore-C and Chromunity as scalable approaches to assess high-order genome structure.""","""['Aditya S Deshpande', 'Netha Ulahannan', 'Matthew Pendleton', 'Xiaoguang Dai', 'Lynn Ly', 'Julie M Behr', 'Stefan Schwenk', 'Will Liao', 'Michael A Augello', 'Carly Tyer', 'Priyesh Rughani', 'Sarah Kudman', 'Huasong Tian', 'Hannah G Otis', 'Emily Adney', 'David Wilkes', 'Juan Miguel Mosquera', 'Christopher E Barbieri', 'Ari Melnick', 'David Stoddart', 'Daniel J Turner', 'Sissel Juul', 'Eoghan Harrington', 'Marcin Imieliński']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nat Biotechnol""","""['Identifying multi-locus chromatin contacts in human cells using tethered multiple 3C.', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Episome Physically Interacts with Active Regions of the Host Genome in Lymphoblastoid Cells.', '5C analysis of the Epidermal Differentiation Complex locus reveals distinct chromatin interaction networks between gene-rich and gene-poor TADs in skin epithelial cells.', 'Novel insights into chromosomal conformations in cancer.', 'Enhancer Dysfunction in 3D Genome and Disease.', 'Impact of supraphysiologic MDM2 expression on chromatin networks and therapeutic responses in sarcoma.', 'Joint profiling of multiplex chromatin interactions, gene expression, and RNA-chromatin associations in single cells of the human brain.', 'HAT: Hypergraph analysis toolbox.', 'Beyond assembly: the increasing flexibility of single-molecule sequencing technology.', 'Considerations and caveats for analyzing chromatin compartments.']"""

Although the lesions may seem to increase bone strength, pathological fracture occurs in one in four patients with prostate cancer. The aim of this study is to elucidate the factors that may increase the risk of pathological fracture in patients with prostate cancer metastases in the proximal femur by analyzing computed tomography data.  Materials and methods:   Computed tomography data of the femur of 62 prostate cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into three groups based on the presence or absence of femoral metastatic lesions and pathological fracture. Surgical specimens of the proximal femur collected from patients who had a pathological fracture were histologically analyzed.  Results:   Bone density in the marrow area was increased in all cases with metastases compared with those with no metastases. Contrarily, the cortical bone density at the medial trochanter region was significantly lower in patients who had pathological fractures in the proximal femur than those who did not. Accordingly, histological analysis of the surgical specimens revealed that the affected cortical bone was osteopenic without any apparent new bone formation.  Conclusion:   These results indicate that prostate cancer is less effective in inducing bone formation in the cortex than in the marrow and that the decrease in the cortical bone density at the medial trochanter region leads to an increased risk of pathological fracture. Therefore, a previously undocumented risk factor for pathological fracture in prostate cancer patients is presented.""","""['Hajime Rikitake', 'Keisuke Horiuchi', 'Kosuke Miyai', 'Michiro Susa', 'Masahiro Inoue', 'Eiko Taguchi', 'Takahiro Ishizaka', 'Kazuhiro Chiba']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Bone Miner Metab""","""['Morphological profile of atypical femoral fractures: age-related changes to the cross-sectional geometry of the diaphysis.', 'CT bone density analysis of low-impact proximal femur fractures using Hounsfield units.', 'Prediction of pathological fracture in patients with lower limb bone metastasis using computed tomography imaging.', 'Current orthopaedic management of bony metastases in the proximal third of the femur.', 'Cortical bone assessed with clinical computed tomography at the proximal femur.']"""

There is a need to identify possible modifiable factors for men at an increased risk of prostate cancer due to genetic factors.  Objective:   To examine whether men at an increased genetic risk of prostate cancer can offset their risk of disease or disease progression by adhering to a healthy lifestyle.  Design, setting, and participants:   We prospectively followed 12 411 genotyped men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1993-2019) and the Physicians' Health Study (1983-2010). Genetic risk of prostate cancer was quantified using a polygenic risk score (PRS). A healthy lifestyle was defined by healthy weight, vigorous physical activity, not smoking, and a healthy diet.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Overall and lethal prostate cancer events (metastatic disease/prostate cancer-specific death) were analyzed using time-to-event analyses estimating hazard ratios (HRs) and lifetime risks.  Results and limitations:   During 27 yr of follow-up, 3005 overall prostate cancer and 435 lethal prostate cancer events were observed. The PRS enabled risk stratification not only for overall prostate cancer, but also for lethal disease with a four-fold difference between men in the highest and lowest quartiles (HR, 4.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.16-5.89). Among men in the highest PRS quartile, adhering to a healthy lifestyle was associated with a decreased rate of lethal prostate cancer (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.86) compared with having an unhealthy lifestyle, translating to a lifetime risk of 1.6% (95% CI, 0.8-3.1%) among the healthy and 5.3% (95% CI, 3.6-7.8%) among the unhealthy. Adhering to a healthy lifestyle was not associated with a decreased risk of overall prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that a genetic predisposition for prostate cancer is not deterministic for a poor cancer outcome. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle may provide a way to offset the genetic risk of lethal prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   This study examined whether the genetic risk of prostate cancer can be attenuated by a healthy lifestyle including a healthy weight, regular exercise, not smoking, and a healthy diet. We observed that adherence to a healthy lifestyle reduced the risk of metastatic disease and prostate cancer death among men at the highest genetic risk. We conclude that men at a high genetic risk of prostate cancer may benefit from adhering to a healthy lifestyle.""","""['Anna Plym', 'Yiwen Zhang', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Bénédicte Delcoigne', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Christopher Haiman', 'Stacey A Kenfield', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Kathryn L Penney', 'Lorelei A Mucci']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Nature versus nurture contribution to prostate cancer risk.', 'Family History of Prostate and Breast Cancer Integrated with a Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Men at Highest Risk of Dying from Prostate Cancer before Age 75 Years.', 'Development and Application of a Lifestyle Score for Prevention of Lethal Prostate Cancer.', 'A Prospective Study of the Association between Physical Activity and Risk of Prostate Cancer Defined by Clinical Features and TMPRSS2:ERG.', ""Regular Aspirin Use and the Risk of Lethal Prostate Cancer in the Physicians' Health Study."", 'Prostate cancer progression and mortality: a review of diet and lifestyle factors.', 'Rosiglitazone has a null association with the risk of prostate cancer in type 2 diabetes patients.', 'The influence of lifestyle changes (diet, exercise and stress reduction) on prostate cancer tumour biology and patient outcomes: A systematic review.', 'Unlocking the mystery associated with infertility and prostate cancer: an update.', 'Polygenic risk of any, metastatic, and fatal prostate cancer in the Million Veteran Program.', 'Family History of Prostate and Breast Cancer Integrated with a Polygenic Risk Score Identifies Men at Highest Risk of Dying from Prostate Cancer before Age 75 Years.']"""

The objective of this study was to validate the GC in a randomized phase III trial of dose-escalated salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy.  Patients and methods:   A clinical-grade whole-transcriptome assay was carried out on radical prostatectomy samples obtained from patients enrolled in Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) 09/10, a phase III trial of 350 men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy randomized to 64 Gy versus 70 Gy without concurrent hormonal therapy or pelvic nodal RT. A prespecified statistical plan was developed to assess the impact of the GC on clinical outcomes. The primary endpoint was biochemical progression; secondary endpoints were clinical progression and time to hormone therapy. Multivariable analyses adjusted for age, T-category, Gleason score, postradical prostatectomy persistent prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA at randomization, and randomization arm were conducted, accounting for competing risks.  Results:   The analytic cohort of 226 patients was representative of the overall trial, with a median follow-up of 6.3 years (interquartile range 6.1-7.2 years). The GC (high versus low-intermediate) was independently associated with biochemical progression [subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.60; P < 0.001], clinical progression (HR 2.29, 95% CI 1.32-3.98; P = 0.003), and use of hormone therapy (sHR 2.99, 95% CI 1.55-5.76; P = 0.001). GC high patients had a 5-year freedom from biochemical progression of 45% versus 71% for GC low-intermediate. Dose escalation did not benefit the overall cohort, nor patients with lower versus higher GC scores.  Conclusions:   This study represents the first contemporary randomized controlled trial in patients treated with early SRT without concurrent hormone therapy or pelvic nodal RT that has validated the prognostic utility of the GC. Independent of standard clinicopathologic variables and RT dose, high-GC patients were more than twice as likely than lower-GC patients to experience biochemical and clinical progression and receive of salvage hormone therapy.

We aimed to investigate if and to what extent these algorithms predict cancer.  Methods:   In four subsets (n = 727, 1003, 910, and 412) of a population-based cohort from Germany, DNA methylation in whole blood was measured using the Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip kit or the Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip Assay (Illumina.Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and a revised MRscore based on 8 CpGs only (MRscore-8CpGs), were calculated. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to assess associations of the three DNAm algorithms with total cancer risk and risk of invasive breast, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer incidence.  Findings:   During 17 years of follow-up, a total of 697 malignant tumors (thereof breast cancer = 75, lung cancer = 146, prostate cancer = 114, colorectal cancer = 155) were observed. All three algorithms showed strong positive associations with lung cancer risk in a dose response manner, with adjusted HRs per SD increase in AgeAccelPheno, AgeAccelGrim, and MRscore-8CpGs, of 1·37 (1·03-1·82), 1·74 (1·11-2·73), and 2·06 (1·39-3·06), respectively. By contrast, strong inverse associations were seen with breast cancer risk [adjusted HRs 0·65 (0·49-0·86), 0·45 (0·25-0·80), and 0·42 (0·25-0·70), respectively]. Weak positive associations of MRscore-8CpGs were seen with total cancer risk.  Interpretation:   The DNAm algorithms, particularly the MRscore-8CpGs, have potential to contribute to site-specific cancer risk prediction.

Bone metastases are a debilitating complication in advanced breast and prostate cancer patients. Approved treatments fail to cure bone metastases or increase patient survival and it remains unclear whether immunotherapy could benefit patients. The bone microenvironment combines various immunosuppressive factors, and combined with T cell products could increase bone resorption fueling the vicious cycle of bone metastases. Using syngeneic mouse models, our study revealed that bone metastases from 4T1 breast cancer contain tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TILs) and their development is increased in normal mice compared to immunodeficient and T-cell depleted mice. This effect seemed caused by the TILs specifically in bone, because T-cell depletion increased 4T1 orthotopic tumors and did not affect bone metastases from RM-1 prostate cancer cells, which lack TILs. T cells increased osteoclast formation ex vivo and in vivo contributing to bone metastasis vicious cycle. This pro-osteoclastic effect is specific to unactivated T cells, because activated T cells, secreting interferon γ (IFNγ) and interleukin 4 (IL-4), actually suppressed osteoclastogenesis, which could benefit patients. However, non-activated T cells from bone metastases could not be activated in ex vivo cultures. 4T1 bone metastases were associated with an increase of functional polymorphonuclear and monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), potent T-cell suppressors. Although effective in other models, sildenafil and zoledronic acid did not affect MDSCs in bone metastases. Seeking other therapeutic targets, we found that monocytic MDSCs are more potent suppressors than polymorphonuclear MDSCs, expressing programmed cell death receptor-1 ligand (PD-L1)+ in bone, which could trigger T-cell suppression because 70% express its receptor, programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1). Collectively, our findings identified a new mechanism by which suppressed T cells increase osteoclastogenesis and bone metastases. Our results also provide a rationale for using immunotherapy because T-cell activation would increase their anti-cancer and their anti-osteoclastic properties. © 2022 The Authors.

Consequently, effective anticancer therapies with fewer adverse effects are needed. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the anticancer activity of the dichloromethane fraction (DCMF) isolated from Arrabidae brachypoda roots, whose components are three unusual dimeric flavonoids. The toxicity of DCMF was investigated in breast (MCF-7), prostate (DU145), and cervical (HeLa) tumor cells, as well as non-tumor cells (PNT2), using sulforhodamine B (cell viability), Comet (genotoxicity), clonogenicity (reproductive capacity) and wound healing (cell migration) assays, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for ultrastructural cell membrane alterations. Molecular docking revealed affinity between albumin and each rare flavonoid, supporting the impact of fetal bovine serum in DCMF antitumor activity. The IC50 values for MCF7, HeLa, and DU145 were 2.77, 2.46, and 2.51 µg/mL, respectively, and 4.08 µg/mL for PNT2. DCFM was not genotoxic to tumor or normal cells when exposed to twice the IC50 for up to 24 h, but it inhibited tumor cell migration and reproduction compared to normal cells. Additionally, AFM revealed alterations in the ultrastructure of tumor nuclear membrane surfaces, with a positive correlation between DCMF concentration and tumor cell roughness. Finally, we found a negative correlation between roughness and the ability of DCMF-treated tumor cells to migrate and form colonies with more than 50 cells.

Results for two-dimensional LRP and RALP are well documented; however, little has been published on the outcomes of 3D LRP. Our objective was to report the perioperative and short-term results of 3D LRP in a multicentre study.  Materials and methods:   In total, 496 unselected men with prostate cancer underwent 3D LRP by three surgeons between December 2013 and December 2018. Median age was 64 (43-76) years. Median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.9 (0.7-148) ng/ml. Preoperative and perioperative data and complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification were collected.

Misfolding of the AR-NTD is implicated in prostate cancer and Kennedy's disease, yet our knowledge of its structure is limited to primary sequence information of the chain and a few functionally important secondary structure motifs. Here, we employed an innovative combination of molecular dynamics simulations and circuit topology (CT) analysis to identify the tertiary structure of AR-NTD. We found that the AR-NTD adopts highly dynamic loopy conformations with two identifiable regions with distinct topological make-up and dynamics. This consists of a N-terminal region (NR, residues 1-224) and a C-terminal region (CR, residues 225-538), which carries a dense core. Topological mapping of the dynamics reveals a traceable time-scale dependent topological evolution. NR adopts different positioning with respect to the CR and forms a cleft that can partly enclose the hormone-bound ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the androgen receptor. Furthermore, our data suggest a model in which dynamic NR and CR compete for binding to the DNA-binding domain of the receptor, thereby regulating the accessibility of its DNA-binding site.

Recently, we found that prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) was one of the most significantly changed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in BPH, which can protect cells against stress stimulation. However, the exact role of PAGE4 in BPH remains unclear. This study is aimed at exploring the effect of PAGE4 in BPH under OS. Human prostate tissues and cultured WPMY-1 and PrPF cells were utilized. The expression and localization of PAGE4 were determined with qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining. OS cell models induced with H2O2 were treated with PAGE4 silencing or PAGE4 overexpression or inhibitor (N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)) of OS. The proliferation activity, apoptosis, OS markers, and MAPK signaling pathways were detected by CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry analysis, and Western blotting. PAGE4 was shown to be upregulated in human hyperplastic prostate and mainly located in the stroma. Acute OS induced with H2O2 increased PAGE4 expression (which was prevented by OS inhibitor), apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in WPMY-1 and PrPF cells. siPAGE4 plus H2O2 potentiated H2O2 effect via reducing the p-ERK1/2 level and increasing p-JNK1/2 level. Consistently, overexpression of PAGE4 offset the effect of H2O2 and partially reversed the PAGE4 silencing effect.

Biopsy samples may be attained using TPPB-VY or TRPB; both of the approaches are relatively comparable in terms of accuracy. Transperineal Access System revolutionizes the methodology for obtaining prostate biopsies. But in Indonesia this device is not available and expensive, we developed VY probe mounted needle guide device. The study was aimed to compare cancer detection rate and rates of cancer detection in Grade Groups (GG) between these two approaches, particularly in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   A cross-sectional study with retrospective data from patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in Hasan Sadikin General Hospital in 2019 - 2020 was performed. Ethical approval of this study was sought from the hospital authorities (IRB number: LB.02.01/X.6.5/ 55/2020). The patient was included to the study if PSA ≥ 4 ng/ml, DRE results suggestive of prostate cancer. The diagnostic accuracy of both approaches was compared using histopathological analysis.  Results:   There were 44 patients included in the study; 22 patients had received TRPB and 22 patients had TPPB-VY. Higher degree of cancer detection rates was found in patients receiving TPPB-VY. Patient with Prostatic adenocarcinoma were all found having hypoechoic lesion in TPPB-VY. On the other hand, half of the patient with Prostatic adenocarcinoma shown having no lesion in TRPB. Prostate cancer with hypoechoic lesion can be detected better by TPPB-VY than TRPB. Cancer detection rates on TPPB-VY were significantly higher than on TRPB for each grade group.  Conclusion:   Among patient with hypoechoic lesions, TPPB-VY led to more detectionof prostate cancer, it provides detection of all grade groups and high-grade prostate cancer, this showed a non-inferior TPPB-VY compared to TRPB. TPPB-VY should be considered as an option for all men in whom a prostate biopsy is indicated.""","""['Sawkar Vijay Pramod', 'Ferry Safriadi', 'Ali Ridho Al Haddar', 'Bethy S Hernowo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Complication rates of transrectal and transperineal prostate fusion biopsies - is there a learning curve even in high volume interventional center?', 'Affordable novel device (VY) for transperineal prostate biopsy: A trial on prostate mannequin.', 'The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'Fosfomycin Trometamol for the Prevention of Infectious Complications After Prostate Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by an International Multidisciplinary Group.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.']"""

Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the most sensitive non-invasive imaging modality that enables visualization, detection, and localization of prostate cancer, and is increasingly used to guide targeted biopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis. However, its utility remains limited due to high rates of false positives and false negatives as well as low inter-reader agreements.  Purpose:   Machine learning methods to detect and localize cancer on prostate MRI can help standardize radiologist interpretations. However, existing machine learning methods vary not only in model architecture, but also in the ground truth labeling strategies used for model training. We compare different labeling strategies and the effects they have on the performance of different machine learning models for prostate cancer detection on MRI.  Methods:   Four different deep learning models (SPCNet, U-Net, branched U-Net, and DeepLabv3+) were trained to detect prostate cancer on MRI using 75 patients with radical prostatectomy, and evaluated using 40 patients with radical prostatectomy and 275 patients with targeted biopsy. Each deep learning model was trained with four different label types: pathology-confirmed radiologist labels, pathologist labels on whole-mount histopathology images, and lesion-level and pixel-level digital pathologist labels (previously validated deep learning algorithm on histopathology images to predict pixel-level Gleason patterns) on whole-mount histopathology images. The pathologist and digital pathologist labels (collectively referred to as pathology labels) were mapped onto pre-operative MRI using an automated MRI-histopathology registration platform.  Results:   Radiologist labels missed cancers (ROC-AUC: 0.75-0.84), had lower lesion volumes (~68% of pathology lesions), and lower Dice overlaps (0.24-0.28) when compared with pathology labels. Consequently, machine learning models trained with radiologist labels also showed inferior performance compared to models trained with pathology labels. Digital pathologist labels showed high concordance with pathologist labels of cancer (lesion ROC-AUC: 0.97-1, lesion Dice: 0.75-0.93). Machine learning models trained with digital pathologist labels had the highest lesion detection rates in the radical prostatectomy cohort (aggressive lesion ROC-AUC: 0.91-0.94), and had generalizable and comparable performance to pathologist label-trained-models in the targeted biopsy cohort (aggressive lesion ROC-AUC: 0.87-0.88), irrespective of the deep learning architecture. Moreover, machine learning models trained with pixel-level digital pathologist labels were able to selectively identify aggressive and indolent cancer components in mixed lesions on MRI, which is not possible with any human-annotated label type.  Conclusions:   Machine learning models for prostate MRI interpretation that are trained with digital pathologist labels showed higher or comparable performance with pathologist label-trained models in both radical prostatectomy and targeted biopsy cohort. Digital pathologist labels can reduce challenges associated with human annotations, including labor, time, inter- and intra-reader variability, and can help bridge the gap between prostate radiology and pathology by enabling the training of reliable machine learning models to detect and localize prostate cancer on MRI.""","""['Indrani Bhattacharya', 'David S Lim', 'Han Lin Aung', 'Xingchen Liu', 'Arun Seetharaman', 'Christian A Kunder', 'Wei Shao', 'Simon J C Soerensen', 'Richard E Fan', 'Pejman Ghanouni', ""Katherine J To'o"", 'James D Brooks', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Mirabela Rusu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Selective identification and localization of indolent and aggressive prostate cancers via CorrSigNIA: an MRI-pathology correlation and deep learning framework.', 'Automated detection of aggressive and indolent prostate cancer on magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Registration of presurgical MRI and histopathology images from radical prostatectomy via RAPSODI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'A review of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection on imaging.']"""

We studied associations of immune-related conditions with cancer-specific mortality among older adults in the United States. We evaluated 1 229 443 patients diagnosed with 20 common cancer types (age 67-99, years 1993-2013) using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare data. With Medicare claims, we ascertained immune-related medical conditions diagnosed before cancer diagnosis (4 immunosuppressive conditions [n = 3380 affected cases], 32 autoimmune conditions [n = 155 766], 3 allergic conditions [n = 101 366]). For each cancer site, we estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific mortality associated with each condition, applying a Bonferroni cutoff for significance (P < 5.1 × 10-5 ). Bayesian metaanalysis methods were used to detect patterns across groups of conditions and cancers. We observed 21 associations with cancer-specific mortality at the Bonferroni threshold. Increased cancer-specific mortality was observed with rheumatoid arthritis for patients with melanoma (aHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.31-1.75) and breast cancer (1.24, 1.15-1.33)), and with hemolytic anemia for bladder cancer (2.54, 1.68-3.82). Significant inverse associations with cancer-specific mortality were observed for allergic rhinitis (range of aHRs: 0.84-0.94) and asthma (0.83-0.95) for cancers of the lung, breast, and prostate. Cancer-specific mortality was nominally elevated in patients with immunosuppressive conditions for eight cancer types (aHR range: 1.27-2.36; P-value range: 7.5 × 10-5 to 3.1 × 10-2 ) and was strongly associated with grouped immunosuppressive conditions using Bayesian metaanalyses methods. For older patients with several cancer types, certain immunosuppressive and autoimmune conditions were associated with increased cancer-specific mortality.

By comparing ELM with a computational efficient neural network, ELM achieves comparable accuracy with less training and inference time.

In vitro saturation and competition binding assays with human prostate cancer cells transfected with PSMA, PC3(+), indicated similar high nM binding affinities to PSMA for all radiotracers. In vivo biodistribution studies with positive control PC3(+) tumor xenografts showed that the kidneys had the highest uptake followed by tumors at 60 min. The PC3(+) tumor uptake was blocked with non-radioactive DCFPyL, and PC3(-) tumor xenograft (negative control) tumor uptake was negligible indicating that PSMA targeting was preserved.

Due to the short half-life in blood, small molecules/peptides are rapidly cleared by the circulatory system. Prolonging the half-life of PSMA probes has been considered as an effective strategy to improve the tumor detection. Herein, we reported a 64Cu-labeled PSMA tracer conjugating with maleimidopropionic acid (MPA), 64Cu-PSMA-CM, which showed an excellent ability to detect PSMA-overexpressing tumors in delayed time. Cell experiments in PSMA-positive 22Rv1 cells, human serum albumin binding affinity, and micro-PET imaging studies in 22Rv1 model were performed to investigate the albumin binding capacity and PSMA specificity. Comparisons with 64Cu-PSMA-BCH were performed to explore the influence of MPA on the biological properties. 64Cu-PSMA-CM could be quickly prepared within 30 min. The uptake of 64Cu-PSMA-CM in 22Rv1 cells increased over time and it could bind to HSA with a high protein binding ratio (67.8 ± 1.5%). When compared to 64Cu-PSMA-BCH, 64Cu-PSMA-CM demonstrated higher and prolonged accumulation in 22Rv1 tumors, contributing to high tumor-to-organ ratios.

An investigation using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed that the major content of the flavonoids are rutin (11.45 µg/mL), quersestin (7.15 µg/mL), naringin (5.25 µg/mL), and hisperdin (6.07 µg/mL), while phenolic had chlorogenic (12.39 µg/mL), syringenic (7.45 µg/mL), and ferulic (5.07 µg/mL) acids in latex of T. peruviana. Via 1,1-diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, the experiment demonstrated that latex had a potent antioxidant activity with the IC50 43.9 µg/mL for scavenging DPPH. Hemolysis inhibition was 58.5% at 1000 µg/mL of latex compared with 91.0% at 200 µg/mL of indomethacin as positive control. Negligible anticoagulant properties of latex were reported where the recorded time was 11.9 s of prothrombin time (PT) and 29.2 s of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at 25 µg/mL, compared with the same concentration of heparin (PT 94.6 s and APPT 117.7 s). The anticancer potential of latex was recorded against PC-3 (97.11% toxicity) and MCF-7 (96.23% toxicity) at 1000 μg/mL with IC50 48.26 μg/mL and 40.31 µg/mL, respectively. Disc diffusion assessment for antimicrobial activity recorded that the most sensitive tested microorganisms to latex were Bacillus subtilis followed by Escherichia coli, with an inhibition zone (IZ) of 31 mm with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (10.2 μg/mL) and 30 mm (MIC, 12.51 μg/mL), respectively. Moreover, Candida albicans was sensitive (IZ, 28 mm) to latex, unlike black fungus (Mucor circinelloides).

Herein, we studied the effect of RSV on the cell viability and invasion potential of gastric cancer cells. AGS and MKN45 cells were treated with different doses of RSV (0-200 μM) for 24 h. Cell viability was determined using the Sulphorhodamine B dye (SRB) assay. For invasion assays, gastric cells were pre-treated with RSV (5-25 μM) for 24 h and then seeded in a Transwell chamber with coating Matrigel. The results obtained showed that RSV inhibited invasion potential in both cell lines. Moreover, to elucidate the mechanism implicated in this process, we analyzed the effects of RSV on SOD, heparanase, and NF-κB transcriptional activity. The results indicated that RSV increased SOD activity in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, RSV significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of NF-κB and the enzymatic activity of heparanase in similar conditions, which was determined using ELISA-like assays. In summary, these results show that RSV increases SOD activity but decreases NF-kB transcriptional activity and heparanase enzymatic activity, which correlates with the attenuation of invasion potential in gastric cancer cells. To our knowledge, no previous study has described the effect of RSV on heparanase activity.

Due to the incidence of prostate cancer and the crucial need to elucidate its molecular mechanisms, we searched for possible prognosis impactful genes in PCa using bioinformatics analysis. A script in R language was used for the identification of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) from the GSE69223 dataset. The gene ontology (GO) of the DEGs and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING online database to identify hub genes. GEPIA and UALCAN databases were utilized for survival analysis and expression validation, and 990 DEGs (316 upregulated and 674 downregulated) were identified. The GO analysis was enriched mainly in the ""collagen-containing extracellular matrix"", and the KEGG pathway analysis was enriched mainly in ""focal adhesion"". The downregulation of neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) was associated with a poor prognosis of PCa and had a significant positive correlation with infiltrating levels of immune cells. We acquired a collection of pathways related to primary PCa, and our findings invite the further exploration of NTRK1 as a biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis, and as a future potential molecular therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Arash Bagherabadi', 'Amirreza Hooshmand', 'Nooshin Shekari', 'Prithvi Singh', 'Samaneh Zolghadri', 'Agata Stanek', 'Ravins Dohare']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Genes (Basel)""","""['Identification of key genes and pathways in castrate-resistant prostate cancer by integrated bioinformatics analysis.', 'Bioinformatics analyses of significant genes, related pathways and candidate prognostic biomarkers in glioblastoma.', 'Identification of prostate cancer hub genes and therapeutic agents using bioinformatics approach.', 'Construction and analysis of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF regulatory networks reveal the key genes associated with prostate cancer.', 'Screening of hub genes and evaluation of the growth regulatory role of CD44 in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Genomic alterations related to HPV infection status in a cohort of Chinese prostate cancer patients.', 'The Role of Histology-Agnostic Drugs in the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Prostate Cancer UK supporters were invited to an online survey which included quantitative and qualitative questions exploring views on the use of DP and AI in histopathological assessment. A total of 1276 responses to the survey were analysed (response rate 12.5%). Most respondents were supportive of DP (87%, 1113/1276) and of testing AI in clinical practice as a diagnostic adjunct (83%, 1058/1276). Respondents saw DP as potentially increasing workflow efficiency, facilitating research, education/training and fostering clinical discussions between clinician and patient. Some respondents raised concerns regarding data security, reliability and the need for human oversight. Among those who were unsure about AI, information was requested regarding its performance and others wanted to defer the decision to use it to an expert. Although most are in favour of its use, some are unsure, and their concerns could be addressed with more information or better communication. A small minority (<1%) are not in favour of the testing of the use of AI in histopathology for reasons which are not easily addressed.""","""['Kai Rakovic', 'Richard Colling', 'Lisa Browning', 'Monica Dolton', 'Margaret R Horton', 'Andrew Protheroe', 'Alastair D Lamb', 'Richard J Bryant', 'Richard Scheffer', 'James Crofts', 'Ewart Stanislaus', 'Clare Verrill']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Diagnostics (Basel)""","""['Survey of liver pathologists to assess attitudes towards digital pathology and artificial intelligence.', 'Current Developments of Artificial Intelligence in Digital Pathology and Its Future Clinical Applications in Gastrointestinal Cancers.', 'Beauty Is in the AI of the Beholder: Are We Ready for the Clinical Integration of Artificial Intelligence in Radiography?

However, the currently reported detection methods cannot achieve rapid monitoring. Here, we report a novel electrochemical immunochromatography (EIC) system for clinically accurate PSA detection. First, we constructed a carbon interface modified with gold nanoflowers (Au NFs) based on screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCE), which acted as nanostructures with larger specific surface area that increased the number of PSA capture antibodies and can further improve detection signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Then, we fabricated detection chips by combining the SPCE/Au NFs with EIC. Under optimized conditions, the proposed biosensor exhibits high accuracy, taking only 15 minutes to complete detection. By measuring the levels of PSA in clinical blood samples, the biosensor can successfully discriminate clinically diagnosed prostate cancer patients from healthy controls.""","""['Yanzhi Dou', 'Zhenhua Li', 'Jing Su', 'Shiping Song']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biosensors (Basel)""","""['A Sensitive Aptamer-Based Biosensor for Electrochemical Quantification of PSA as a Specific Diagnostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA tetrahedron-mediated immune-sandwich assay for rapid and sensitive detection of PSA through a microfluidic electrochemical detection system.', 'An Ultra-Rapid Biosensory Point-of-Care (POC) Assay for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Detection in Human Serum.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.', 'Nanomaterial-based biosensors for detection of prostate specific antigen.', 'Recent Advances in Aptamer-Based Sensors for Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters.', 'Label-Free Electrochemical Biosensor Platforms for Cancer Diagnosis: Recent Achievements and Challenges.', 'Recent Advancements in Electrochemical Biosensors for Monitoring the Water Quality.']"""
