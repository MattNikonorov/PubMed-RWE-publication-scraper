Consequently, altered cholesterol biology has been linked to many diseases, including metabolic syndromes and cancer. Defining the intracellular pools of cholesterol and its trafficking within cells is essential to understand both normal cell physiology and mechanisms of pathogenesis. We have synthesized a new cholesterol mimic (ReTEGCholestanol), comprising a luminescent rhenium metal complex and a cholestanol targeting unit, linked using a tetraethylene glycol (TEG) spacer. ReTEGCholestanol demonstrated favourable imaging properties and improved water solubility when compared to a cholesterol derivative, and structurally related probes lacking the TEG linker. A non-malignant and three malignant prostate cell lines were used to characterize the uptake and intracellular distribution of ReTEGCholestanol. The ReTEGCholestanol complex was effectively internalized and mainly localized to late endosomes/lysosomes in non-malignant PNT1a cells, while in prostate cancer cells it also accumulated in early endosomes and multivesicular bodies, suggesting disturbed cholesterol biology in the malignant cells. The ReTEGCholestanol is a novel imaging agent for visualizing endosomal uptake and trafficking, which may be used to define cholesterol related biology including membrane integration and altered lipid trafficking/processing.""","""['Joanna Lazniewska', 'Christie Bader', 'Shane M Hickey', 'Stavros Selemidis', ""John O'Leary"", 'Peter V Simpson', 'Stefano Stagni', 'Sally E Plush', 'Massimiliano Massi', 'Doug Brooks']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Metallomics""","""['Dietary cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I are trafficked in endosomes and lysosomes in the live zebrafish intestine.', 'Distribution and trafficking of MPR300 is normal in cells with cholesterol accumulated in late endocytic compartments: evidence for early endosome-to-TGN trafficking of MPR300.', 'Effects of cholesterol depletion and increased lipid unsaturation on the properties of endocytic membranes.', 'Adenovirus Reveals New Pathway for Cholesterol Egress from the Endolysosomal System.', 'Endosomal cholesterol traffic: vesicular and non-vesicular mechanisms meet.']"""

In order to gain molecular insights into the zinc homeostasis of breast and prostate cancer cells, this study profiled the expression of 28 genes, including 14 zinc importer genes (SLC39A1-14) that encode Zrt/Irt-like proteins 1-14 to transport Zn2+ into the cytoplasm, 10 zinc exporter genes (SLC30A1-10) which encode Zn2+ transporters 1-10 to transport Zn2+ out of the cytoplasm, and 4 metallothionein genes (MT1B, MT1F, MT1X, MT2A) in breast (MCF10A, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) and prostate (RWPE-1, PC3, DU145) cell lines in response to extracellular zinc exposures at a mild cytotoxic dosage and a benign dosage. The RNA samples were prepared at 0 min (T0), 30 min (T30), and 120 min (T120) in a time course with or without zinc exposure, which were used for profiling the baseline and dynamic gene expression. The up-regulation of MT genes was observed across the breast and prostate cancer cell lines. The expression landscape of SLC39A and SLC30A was revealed by the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction data of this study, which sheds light on the divergence of intracellular Zn2+ levels for breast and prostate cancer cells. Taken together, the findings are valuable in unraveling the molecular intricacy of zinc homeostasis in breast and prostate cancer cells.""","""['Shital K Barman', 'Mohammad S Zaman', 'Filip Veljanoski', 'Chandra S Malladi', 'David A Mahns', 'Ming J Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Metallomics""","""['Transcriptomic insights into the zinc homeostasis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells via next-generation RNA sequencing.', 'Profiling of zinc-altered gene expression in human prostate normal vs. cancer cells: a time course study.', 'Differential expression of metallothioneins (MTs) 1, 2, and 3 in response to zinc treatment in human prostate normal and malignant cells and tissues.', 'Insight to physiology and pathology of zinc(II) ions and their actions in breast and prostate carcinoma.', 'Zinc dysregulation in cancers and its potential as a therapeutic target.', 'DNA methylation differences in noncoding regions in ER negative breast tumors between Black and White women.']"""

Previous reports suggested a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 among PCa patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, the impact of ADT on severe COVID-19 illness is poorly understood.  Methods:   We performed a multicenter study across 7 US medical centers and evaluated patients with PCa and SARS-CoV-2 detected by polymerase-chain-reaction between March 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. PCa patients were considered on ADT if they had received appropriate ADT treatment within 6 months of COVID-19 diagnosis. We used multivariable logistic and Cox proportional-hazard regression models for analysis. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   We identified 465 PCa patients (median age = 71 years) with a median follow-up of 60 days. Age, body mass index, cardiovascular comorbidity, and PCa clinical disease state adjusted overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.68 to 1.98, P = .59), hospitalization status (HR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.52 to 1.77, P = .90), supplemental oxygenation (HR 1.14, 95% CI = 0.66 to 1.99, P = .64), and use of mechanical ventilation (HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.25 to 2.66, P = .73) were similar between ADT and non-ADT cohorts. Similarly, the addition of androgen receptor-directed therapy within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis to ADT vs ADT alone did not statistically significantly affect overall survival (androgen receptor-directed therapy: HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 0.69 to 2.32, P = .44).  Conclusions:   In this retrospective cohort of PCa patients, the use of ADT was not demonstrated to influence severe COVID-19 outcomes, as defined by hospitalization, supplemental oxygen use, or death.

We also compare with the Nordic rates and show incidence rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios (MRR).Materials and methods: The Faroese cancer registry (FCR) was established in 1994, with incidence available from 1960 and mortality from 1983. The FCR is a part of the NORDCAN collaboration, where the different Nordic countries all report anonymized cancer data by standardized methods, ensuring comparability. Validation efforts revealed that 13% of cases had not been reported to the FCR from 2006 to 2019, emphasizing the need for continued validation efforts of cancer registries. After validation, we submitted the updated cancer cases to NORDCAN and now present this data, taken directly from the NORDCAN website (2019 data).Results: We found that the incidence of the summary group all cancers in the Faroe Islands increased from 1960 to 2019, while cancer mortality decreased from 1983 to 2019. Comparisons with Nordic rates showed significantly lower IRRs for cancer in all cancers, bladder and urinary tract, and skin cancer for both sexes, while IRR was lower for breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. Contrary, IRR was higher for rectum and kidney cancer in women and esophagus and testicular cancer in men. There was an increased MRR for cancer in female organs, bladder and urinary tract, and kidney cancer in women, and esophagus and pancreas cancer in men. In contrast, malignant hematopoietic diseases and melanoma in women had a lower MRR.Conclusions: Cancer incidence in the Faroe Islands was lower than in the other Nordic countries. Of particular interest, the incidence of testicular cancer saw a steep increase during the last 20 years, and an investigation into possible causes for this is needed.""","""['Marnar F Kristiansen', 'Ronja M Mikkelsen', 'Tordis Kristiansdóttir', 'Páll Rasmussen', 'Guðrið Andórsdóttir', 'Sæunn Ó Hansen', 'Kári R Nielsen', 'Bjarni Á Steig', 'Marin Strøm', 'Maria Skaalum Petersen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Cancer survival in the Faroe Islands over the last 50\u2009years compared to the other Nordic countries.', 'Time trends and occupational variation in the incidence of testicular cancer in the Nordic countries.', 'Incidence, mortality and relative survival of patients with cancer of the bladder and upper urothelial tract in the Nordic countries between 1990 and 2019.', 'Global Burden of Urologic Cancers, 1990-2013.', 'Work-related cancer in the Nordic countries.']"""

MSCC is an extreme oncological emergency, because it involves both functional and vital prognosis. The present study aimed to establish a pattern of MSCC in prostate cancer patients in Douala and Yaoundé general hospitals (Cameroon).  Methods:   this was a descriptive and retrospective study in the Radiotherapy and Medical Oncology services at both Douala and Yaoundé General Hospitals. The explored variables were general characteristics of the study population, clinical and paraclinical features, management and outcomes. Furthermore 5-year survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Logistic regression by determining the odd ratios and their 95% confidence was done using ""Statistical Package for Social Sciences"" (SPSS 23) software. The difference was considered significant at p < 0.05.  Results:   our series consisted of 151 patients out of which the mean age was 66.88 (SD: 8.71) years (95% CI: 44-88). Pain was the most common clinical symptom (53.33%; n= 80) and fracture-settlement accounted for majority (60%; n= 90.61) of the pain. Thoracic spine damage was encountered by 47.02% (n= 71). Patients received a total doses of irradiation between 20 and 30 gray (Gy). The main toxicity due to radiotherapy were asthenia (45.70%; n= 69.11). The overall survival at 5 years was 90.11%. Factors associated with fracture-settlement were smoking (aOR 10.04, 95% CI: 2.09-48.12; p = 0.004) and the localization of MSCC occurred (aOR 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05-0.77; p = 0.02).  Conclusion:   in summary the average age for developing the condition is 66.88 years and factors associated with fracture-settlement were smoking and the localization of MSCC. Back pain was the most common clinical sign and fracture-settlement was the first type of injury on medical magnetic resonance imaging. Therefore, we recommend that emphasis should be placed on increasing awareness of the population on the importance of early diagnosis.""","""['Etienne Okobalemba Atenguena', 'Rostand Wilfreed Mbassa Betchem', 'Anne Marthe Maison Maye', 'Anne Juliette Sango', 'Stéphane Zingue', 'Faustin Dong Zok']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pan Afr Med J""","""['Incidence, associated factors, and survival in metastatic spinal cord compression secondary to lung cancer.', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'Incidence and risk factors associated with the development of metastatic spinal cord compression due to bone metastasis in women with cervical cancer.', 'Survival in patients with metastatic spinal cord compression from prostate cancer is associated with the number of extra-spinal organs involved.', 'Assessment and Management of Patients With Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression: A Multidisciplinary Review.']"""

Furthermore, target prediction and dual-luciferase reporter assays identified transmembrane 9 superfamily member 4 (TM9SF4) as a potential miR-1248 target. Pathway analysis revealed that TM9SF4 activated autophagy to promote PCa cells anoikis resistance via mTOR phosphorylation.

However, the detailed biological functions of circRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) remain unclear. Using high-throughput circRNA sequencing, we previously identified 18 urine extracellular vesicle circRNAs that were increased in patients with PCa compared with those with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Spearman correlation analysis of the expression levels of the 18 circRNAs between the tumor tissue and matched urine extracellular vesicles in 30 PCa patients showed that circSCAF8 had the highest R2 (R2 = 0.635, P < 0.001). The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the effect of circSCAF8 on progression-free survival. The in vitro and in vivo functional experiments were implemented to investigate the effects of circSCAF8 on the phenotype of PCa. We found that the knockdown of circSCAF8 in PCa cells suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability, while overexpression of circSCAF8 had the opposite effects. Similar results were observed in vivo. In a cohort of 85 patients who had undergone radical prostatectomy, circSCAF8 expression in PCa tissues was a powerful predictor of progression-free survival (HR = 2.14, P = 0.022). Mechanistically, circSCAF8 can function by binding to both miR-140-3p and miR-335 to regulate LIF expression and activate the LIF-STAT3 pathway that leads to the growth and metastasis of PCa. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that circSCAF8 contributes to PCa progression through the circSCAF8-miR-140-3p/miR-335-LIF pathway.""","""['Tao He#', 'Wen Tao#', 'Lei-Lei Zhang#', 'Bang-Yu Wang#', 'Ke Li', 'Hui-Min Lu', 'Guo-Jun Tang', 'Ya-Di He', 'Liao-Yuan Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Exosomal circRNA HIPK3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer by regulating miR-212/BMI-1 pathway.', 'Circular RNA circMBOAT2 promotes prostate cancer progression via a miR-1271-5p/mTOR axis.', 'Circular RNA midline-1 (circMID1) promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis in prostate cancer.', 'Novel circular RNA circSOBP governs amoeboid migration through the regulation of the miR-141-3p/MYPT1/p-MLC2 axis in prostate cancer.', 'Exosomes derived from myeloid-derived suppressor cells facilitate castration-resistant prostate cancer progression via S100A9/circMID1/miR-506-3p/MID1.', 'Extracellular vesicle-circEHD2 promotes the progression of renal cell carcinoma by activating cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'Hsa_circ_0063329 inhibits prostate cancer growth and metastasis by modulating the miR-605-5p/tgif2 axis.', 'Inhibition of O-GlcNAc transferase sensitizes prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.']"""

Noninvasive, high-resolution human brain mapping of sodium pump flux and cell metrics""","""We introduce a new 1 H2 O magnetic resonance approach: metabolic activity diffusion imaging (MADI). Numerical diffusion-weighted imaging decay simulations characterized by the mean cellular water efflux (unidirectional) rate constant (kio ), mean cell volume (V), and cell number density (ρ) are produced from Monte Carlo random walks in virtual stochastically sized/shaped cell ensembles. Because of active steady-state trans-membrane water cycling (AWC), kio reflects the cytolemmal Na+ , K+ ATPase (NKA) homeostatic cellular metabolic rate (c MRNKA ). A digital 3D ""library"" contains thousands of simulated single diffusion-encoded (SDE) decays. Library entries match well with disparate, animal, and human experimental SDE decays. The V and ρ values are consistent with estimates from pertinent in vitro cytometric and ex vivo histopathological literature: in vivo V and ρ values were previously unavailable. The library allows noniterative pixel-by-pixel experimental SDE decay library matchings that can be used to advantage. They yield proof-of-concept MADI parametric mappings of the awake, resting human brain. These reflect the tissue morphology seen in conventional MRI. While V is larger in gray matter (GM) than in white matter (WM), the reverse is true for ρ. Many brain structures have kio values too large for current, invasive methods. For example, the median WM kio is 22s-1 ; likely reflecting mostly exchange within myelin. The kio •V product map displays brain tissue c MRNKA variation. The GM activity correlates, quantitatively and qualitatively, with the analogous resting-state brain 18 FDG-PET tissue glucose consumption rate (t MRglucose ) map; but noninvasively, with higher spatial resolution, and no pharmacokinetic requirement. The cortex, thalamus, putamen, and caudate exhibit elevated metabolic activity. MADI accuracy and precision are assessed. The results are contextualized with literature overall homeostatic brain glucose consumption and ATP production/consumption measures. The MADI/PET results suggest different GM and WM metabolic pathways.

This article offers a thematic synthesis of the qualitative research on men living with breast cancer or prostate cancer. This is a qualitative meta-analysis assessing how masculinities and aging may jointly affect men's narratives post-mastectomy or post-prostatectomy. Of particular interest was whether and how aging mediates the experience of these gendered cancers. Reviewed were all qualitative studies published between 2000 and 2020 addressing men's breast cancer and post-mastectomy experiences (N = 15) and men's lives after their prostatectomy (N = 28). The analysis followed the guidelines for thematic synthesis and grounded theory. Free codes of findings were organized into ""descriptive"" themes, which are then further interpreted to yield ""analytical"" themes. Seven descriptive themes were identified and these underlie two analytical themes - body talk and resilience. Collectively, men's illness narratives spoke about how cancer challenges their gendered identities and practices, and how they repair identities. The common experience was one of men coming to live with their post-surgical bodies by practicing 'wider,' hybrid forms of masculinities. The principal finding is that men with either type of cancer saw themselves as men and remained seen by others in terms of their gender, not their anatomically changed bodies.

We evaluated a range of recruitment strategies and their ability to recruit from the Black population and areas of deprivation.  Methods:   IP1-PROSTAGRAM was a prospective, population-based, paired screening study of 408 participants conducted at seven UK primary care practices and two imaging centres. All participants underwent screening with a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transrectal ultrasound. A number of recruitment strategies were embedded including direct mail, media campaigns, and a targeted recruitment strategy to increase participation among harder-to-reach groups.  Results:   A total of 1,316 expressions of interest were received (20th September 2018 to 15th May 2019). The direct mail strategy generated 317 expressions of interest from 1707 invitation letters. Overall 387 expressions of interest were received following the targeted strategy and 612 from media campaigns. The recruitment target was met 19 months ahead of the schedule. Of the 411 participants, ethnicity was White (38.0%), Black (32.4%), Asian (23.0%), and Other/Mixed (4.4%) ethnic groups. This higher recruitment of Black men was driven by the targeted recruitment strategy. A comparison of recruitment methods showed marked differences between ethnicities recruited (P < 0.001). The proportion of Black participants recruited by direct mail (8%) was similar to the prevalence of Black local population (9%) whereas, targeted recruitment was 88% (115) and media recruitment 1.7% (1). The Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) distribution was similar to the local population with marginal higher recruitment from more deprived areas; proportion increasing from 26% to 40% from least to most deprived IMD quintiles (Quintiles 4/5 vs. 1/2). Direct mail recruited a close-to-normal distribution for deprivation with targeted recruitment trending towards recruiting from most deprived areas.

The SASP affects the environment of senescent cells, especially during aging, by inducing and modulating various phenotypes such as paracrine senescence, immune cell activity, and extracellular matrix deposition and organization, which critically impact various pathophysiological situations, including fibrosis and cancer. Here, we uncover a novel paracrine effect of the SASP: the neuroendocrine transdifferentiation (NED) of some epithelial cancer cells, evidenced both in the breast and prostate. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by NF-κB-dependent SASP factors, and leads to an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Consistently, buffering Ca2+ by overexpressing the CALB1 buffering protein partly reverts SASP-induced NED, suggesting that the SASP promotes NED through a SASP-induced Ca2+ signaling. Human breast cancer dataset analyses support that NED occurs mainly in p53 WT tumors and in older patients, in line with a role of senescent cells and its secretome, as they are increasing during aging. In conclusion, our work, uncovering SASP-induced NED in some cancer cells, paves the way for future studies aiming at better understanding the functional link between senescent cell accumulation during aging, NED and clinical patient outcome.""","""['Clotilde Raynard', 'Xingjie Ma', 'Anda Huna', 'Nolwenn Tessier', 'Amélie Massemin', 'Kexin Zhu', 'Jean-Michel Flaman', 'Florentin Moulin', 'Delphine Goehrig', 'Jean-Jacques Medard', 'David Vindrieux', 'Isabelle Treilleux', 'Hector Hernandez-Vargas', 'Sylvie Ducreux', 'Nadine Martin', 'David Bernard']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Aging Cell""","""['Atractylenolide III suppresses senescence-associated secretome via inhibiting cGAS/NF-κB pathway in hepatic stellate cells.', 'Senescent Secretome of Blind Mole Rat Spalax Inhibits Malignant Behavior of Human Breast Cancer Cells Triggering Bystander Senescence and Targeting Inflammatory Response.', 'CD36 initiates the secretory phenotype during the establishment of cellular senescence.', 'Keeping the senescence secretome under control: Molecular reins on the senescence-associated secretory phenotype.', 'The senescence-associated secretory phenotype and its regulation.', 'The senescence-associated secretory phenotype induces neuroendocrine transdifferentiation.', 'Expression of the Calcium-Binding Protein CALB1 Is Induced and Controls Intracellular Ca2+ Levels in Senescent Cells.']"""

Our objective was to determine the value for money to the English National Health Service (NHS) of adding AAP to SOC. We used a decision analytic model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of providing AAP in the English NHS. Between 2011-2014, the STAMPEDE trial recruited 1917 men with high-risk localised, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic PC starting first-line androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and they were randomised to receive SOC plus AAP, or SOC alone. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using STAMPEDE trial data supplemented with literature data where necessary, adjusting for baseline patient and disease characteristics. British National Formulary (BNF) prices (£98/day) were applied for AAP. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%/year. AAP was not cost-effective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £149,748/QALY gained in the non-metastatic (M0) subgroup, with 2.4% probability of being cost-effective at NICE's £30,000/QALY threshold; and the metastatic (M1) subgroup had an ICER of £47,503/QALY gained, with 12.0% probability of being cost-effective. Scenario analysis suggested AAP could be cost-effective in M1 patients if priced below £62/day, or below £28/day in the M0 subgroup. AAP could dominate SOC in the M0 subgroup with price below £11/day. AAP is effective for non-metastatic and metastatic disease but is not cost-effective when using the BNF price. AAP currently only has UK approval for use in a subset of M1 patients. The actual price currently paid by the English NHS for abiraterone acetate is unknown.

Elevated oxidative and proteotoxic stress in mitochondria must be attenuated by the activation of a ubiquitous UPRmt to promote prostate cancer (PCa) growth. Here we show that the 2 key components of the UPRmt, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60, a mitochondrial chaperonin) and caseinolytic protease P (ClpP, a mitochondrial protease), were required for the development of advanced PCa. HSP60 regulated ClpP expression via c-Myc and physically interacted with ClpP to restore mitochondrial functions that promote cancer cell survival. HSP60 maintained the ATP-producing functions of mitochondria, which activated the β-catenin pathway and led to the upregulation of c-Myc. We identified a UPRmt inhibitor that blocked HSP60's interaction with ClpP and abrogated survival signaling without altering HSP60's chaperonin function. Disruption of HSP60-ClpP interaction with the UPRmt inhibitor triggered metabolic stress and impeded PCa-promoting signaling. Treatment with the UPRmt inhibitor or genetic ablation of Hsp60 inhibited PCa growth and progression.

Methods:   This is a retrospective study of mCRPC patients who received Ra-223 and genetic testing within the Mayo Clinic database (Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota) and Tulane Cancer Center. Patient demographics, genetic aberrations, treatment responses in terms of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and survival were assessed. Primary end points were ALP and PSA response. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from time of first radium treatment.  Results:   One hundred and twenty-seven mCRPC patients treated with Ra-223 had germline and/or somatic genetic sequencing. The median age at time of diagnosis and Ra-223 treatment was 61.0 and 68.6 years, respectively. Seventy-nine (62.2%) had Gleason score ≥ 8 at time of diagnosis. 50.4% received prior docetaxel, and 12.6% received prior cabazitaxel.

Crude probabilities of SM were 9.16% for WPRT and 8.88% for PORT. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for development of SM with PORT versus WPRT was 1.046 (95% confidence interval 0.968-1.130). Temporal sensitivity analyses by stratifying by year of diagnosis and follow-up length also did not demonstrate any significant difference in rates of SM between WPRT and PORT using AORs with WPRT as the referent.  Conclusions:   Retrospective analysis of over 50,000 patients did not demonstrate an association between WPRT and an increased probability of SM compared to PORT. Given the findings of POP-RT, the use of WPRT may become widespread for certain subsets of men. Thus, our findings could help guide how we counsel patients deciding between WPRT and PORT and suggest the need for prospective assessment of SM risk with WPRT and PORT.""","""['Hae Lin Cho', 'Vedang Murthy', 'Kent W Mouw', ""Anthony V D'Amico"", 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Jonathan E Leeman', 'Edward Christopher Dee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Effect of whole pelvic radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and long-term androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Sequence of hormonal therapy and radiotherapy field size in unfavourable, localised prostate cancer (NRG/RTOG 9413): long-term results of a randomised, phase 3 trial.', 'Survival Outcomes of Whole-Pelvic Versus Prostate-Only Radiation Therapy for High-Risk Prostate Cancer Patients With Use of the National Cancer Data Base.', 'The evolving role of pelvic radiation therapy.', 'Whole-pelvic nodal radiation therapy in the context of hypofractionation for high-risk prostate cancer patients: a step forward.', 'Dosimetric and Hematologic Implications of Prostate-Only Versus Whole Pelvic Radiotherapy: Results of the Multicentric Phase 3 PROPER Study.']"""

We evaluate the frequency of germline DDRg mutations among French mPC patients of European and African ancestries.  Methods:   Targeted next-generation sequencing of 21 DDRg was performed on germline DNA from 557 mPC patients, including 15.1% of cases with an African origin.  Results:   Forty-seven germline mutations in 11 DDR genes were identified in 46 patients of the total cohort (8.3%). BRCA2 (4.1%) and ATM (2.0%) were the most frequently mutated genes. There was no difference in DDRg mutation frequency between mPC patients of European ancestry and those of African origin. Germline mutations of BRCA2 were associated with a positive family history of breast cancer (p = 0.02). The mean age at metastatic stage (59.7 vs. 67.0; p = 0.0003) and the mean age at death (65.2 vs. 73.9; p = 0.0003) were significantly earlier for carriers of BRCA2 mutation than for non-carriers.

Retinoic acid-induced 2 (RAI2) protein is thought to act as a transcriptional coregulator involved in hormonal responses and epithelial differentiation. We evaluated the clinical relevance and biological function of the RAI2 protein in prostate cancer.  Methods:   We assessed RAI2 gene expression in the Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma PanCancer cohort and protein expression in primary tumors (n = 199) by immunohistochemistry. We studied RAI2 gene expression as part of a multimarker panel in an enriched circulating tumor cell population isolated from blood samples (n = 38) of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. In prostate cancer cell lines, we analyzed the consequences of androgen receptor inhibition on RAI2 protein expression and the consequences of RAI2 depletion on the expression of the androgen receptor and selected target genes.  Results:   Abundance of the RAI2 protein in adenocarcinomas correlated with the androgen receptor; keratins 8, 18, and 19; and E-cadherin as well as with an early biochemical recurrence. In circulating tumor cells, detection of RAI2 mRNA significantly correlated with gene expression of FOLH1, KLK3, RAI2, AR, and AR-V7. In VCaP and LNCaP cell lines, sustained inhibition of hormone receptor activity induced the RAI2 protein, whereas RAI2 depletion augmented the expression of MME, STEAP4, and WIPI1.

Through the use of an alternative promoter, a truncated c-KIT protein (tr-KIT) of 30-50 kDa is generated, lacking the extracellular and transmembrane domain. Tr-KIT promotes the formation of a multi-molecular complex composed of Fyn, Plcγ1, and Sam68. Imatinib blocks the activity of full-length c-KIT but has no effect on tr-KIT. LNCaP is the human PCa cell line that shows tr-KIT overexpression and PC3 does not show tr-KIT overexpression. miR-128/193a- 5p/494 are miRNAs targeting FYN, PLCγ1, and SAM68 combinatorially. The study's question is: can miR-128/193a- 5p/494 be related to imatinib resistance in PCa?  Methods:   LNCaP and PC3 cells were treated with imatinib in IC50 doses. Before and after imatinib administration, RNA was isolated and cDNA conversion was performed. By qPCR analysis, expression changes of tr-KIT specific pathway elements and miR-128/193a-5p/494 were analyzed before and after imatinib administration.  Results:   After imatinib administration, miR-128/193a-5p/494 were significantly overexpressed in LNCaP cells while downregulated significantly in PC3 cells (p<0.05). Also, FYN was upregulated in LNCaP cells (p<0.05) but there was no change in PC3 after imatinib administration.  Conclusion:   Especially upregulation of FYN may sponge miR128/193a-5p/494 and downregulate their transcriptional activity in LNCaP cells having tr-KIT activity. So, miR-128/193a-5p/494 may have a critical role in imatinib resistance via a tr-KIT pathway.""","""['Sercan Ergün', 'Oğuzhan Akgün', 'Neslihan Taşkurt Hekim', 'Senanur Aslan', 'Ferda Ari', 'Sezgin Güneş', 'Ümmet Abur']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Long non-coding RNA TTN-AS1 promotes cell proliferation and inhibits cell apoptosis in prostatic cancer by sponging miR-193a-5p.', 'Involvement of aberrantly activated HOTAIR/EZH2/miR-193a feedback loop in progression of prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-27a-5p regulation by promoter methylation and MYC signaling in prostate carcinogenesis.', 'Identification of a novel microRNA-mRNA regulatory biomodule in human prostate cancer.', 'Silencing of miR-193a-5p increases the chemosensitivity of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel.', 'FYN: emerging biological roles and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.']"""

Methods:   Herein, we investigated the expression, survival data, and immune infiltration levels of LEMs in PRAD patients from ATCG, TIMER, LinkedOmics, and TISIDB databases. We also further validated the mRNA and protein expression levels of ANKLE1, EMD, and LEMD2 in human prostate tumor specimens by qPCR, WB, and IHC.  Results:   We found that all LEM expressions, except for that of LAP2, were markedly altered in PRAD compared to the normal samples. Among all LEMs, only the expressions of ANKLE1, EMD, and LEMD2 were correlated with advanced tumor stage and survival prognosis in PRAD. Consistent with the predicted computational results, the mRNA and protein expression levels of these genes were markedly increased in the PRAD group. We then found that ANKLE1, EMD, and LEMD2 expressions were markedly correlated with immune cell infiltration levels. High ANKLE1, EMD, and LEMD2 expressions predicted a worse prognosis in PRAD based on immune cells. DNA methylation or/and copy number variations may contribute to the abnormal upregulation of ANKLE1, EMD, and LEMD2 in PRAD.

However, the clinical significance, biological function, and molecular mechanisms of circRNAs in prostate cancer remain to be elucidated.  Methods:   A circRNA array was performed to identified the differentially expressed circRNAs. circPDE5A was identified as a novel circRNA which downregulated in clinical samples. Functionally, the in vitro and in vivo assays were applied to explore the role of circPDE5A in PCa metastasis. Mechanistically, the interaction between circPDE5A and WTAP was verified using RNA pulldown followed by mass spectrometry, RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. m6A methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) was then used to identified the downstream target of circPDE5A. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) and dual-luciferase reporter assay were used to identified transcriptional factor which regulated circPDE5A expression.  Results:   circPDE5A was identified downregulated in PCa tissues compared to adjacent normal tissue and was negatively correlated with gleason score of PCa patients. circPDE5A inhibits PCa cells migration and invasion both in vitro and in vivo. circPDE5A blocks the WTAP-dependent N6-methyladenisine (m6A) methylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3c (EIF3C) mRNA by forming the circPDE5A-WTAP complex, and finally disrupts the translation of EIF3C. Moreover, the circPDE5A-dependent decrease in EIF3C expression inactivates the MAPK pathway and then restrains PCa progression.

Efforts for the treatment of gastric cancer have increased its median survival rate by only seven months. Due to the relatively low response of gastric cancer to surgery and adjuvant therapy, as well as the complex role of risk factors in its incidences, such as protein-pomp inhibitors (PPIs) and viral and bacterial infections, we aimed to study the pathological pathways involved in gastric cancer development and investigate possible medications by systems biology and bioinformatics tools. In this study, the protein-protein interaction network was analyzed based on microarray data, and possible effective compounds were discovered. Non-coding RNA versus coding RNA interaction network and gene-disease network were also reconstructed to better understand the underlying mechanisms. It was found that compounds such as amiloride, imatinib, omeprazole, troglitazone, pantoprazole, and fostamatinib might be effective in gastric cancer treatment. In a gene-disease network, it was indicated that diseases such as liver carcinoma, breast carcinoma, liver fibrosis, prostate cancer, ovarian carcinoma, and lung cancer were correlated with gastric adenocarcinoma through specific genes, including hgf, mt2a, mmp2, fbn1, col1a1, and col1a2. It was shown that signaling pathways such as cell cycle, cell division, and extracellular matrix organization were overexpressed, while digestion and ion transport pathways were underexpressed. Based on a multilevel systems biology analysis, hub genes in gastric adenocarcinoma showed participation in the pathways such as focal adhesion, platelet activation, gastric acid secretion, HPV infection, and cell cycle. PPIs are hypothesized to have a therapeutic effect on patients with gastric cancer. Fostamatinib seems a potential therapeutic drug in gastric cancer due to its inhibitory effect on two survival genes.

A substantial number of patients, however, are prone to treatment failure. We aimed to determine clinical baseline characteristics to predict OS in patients receiving [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T RLT in a long-term follow-up.  Materials and methods:   Ninety-two mCRPC patients treated with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T with a follow-up of at least 18 months were retrospectively identified. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for various baseline characteristics, including laboratory values, Gleason score, age, prior therapies, and time interval between initial diagnosis and first treatment cycle (intervalDiagnosis-RLT, per 12 months). Cutoff values for significant predictors were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. ROC-derived thresholds were then applied to Kaplan-Meier analyses.  Results:   Baseline C-reactive protein (CRP; hazard ratio [HR], 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.01), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; HR, 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.11; P = 0.01), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; HR, 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26; P = 0.001), and intervalDiagnosis-RLT (HR, 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99; P = 0.02) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The following respective ROC-based thresholds were determined: CRP, 0.98 mg/dl (area under the curve [AUC], 0.80); LDH, 276.5 U/l (AUC, 0.83); AST, 26.95 U/l (AUC, 0.73); and intervalDiagnosis-RLT, 43.5 months (AUC, 0.68; P < 0.01, respectively). Respective Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated a significantly longer median OS of patients with lower CRP, lower LDH, and lower AST, as well as prolonged intervalDiagnosis-RLT (P ≤ 0.01, respectively).  Conclusion:   In mCRPC patients treated with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T, baseline CRP, LDH, AST, and time interval until RLT initiation (thereby reflecting a possible indicator for tumor aggressiveness) are independently associated with survival.

Herein, we demonstrate that enzalutamide and AR-directed antisense oligonucleotides (AR-ASO) block 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced DSRCT cell proliferation and reduce xenograft tumor burden. Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were performed to elucidate how AR signaling regulates cellular epigenetic programs.

Unfortunately, within the field and many clinical trials, the dosimetry calculation techniques used remain relatively simple, often using a mix of S-value calculations and kernel convolutions.  Purpose:   The common TRT calculation techniques, although very quick, can often ignore important aspects of patient anatomy and radionuclide distribution, as well as the interplay there-in. This paper introduces egs_mird, a new Monte Carlo (MC) application built in EGSnrc which allows users to model full patient tissue and density (using clinical CT images) and radionuclide distribution (using clinical PET images) for fast and detailed dose TRT calculation.  Methods:   The novel application egs_mird is introduced along with a general outline of the structure of egs_mird simulations. The general structure of the code, and the track-length (TL) estimator scoring implementation for variance reduction, is described. A new egs++ source class egs_internal_source, created to allow detailed patient-wide source distribution, and a modified version of egs_radionuclide_source, changed to be able to work with egs_internal_source, are also described. The new code is compared to other MC calculations of S-values kernels of 131 I, 90 Y, and 177 Lu in the literature, along with further self-validation using a histogram variant of the electron Fano test. Several full patient prostate 177 Lu TRT prostate cancer treatment simulations are performed using a single set of patient DICOM CT and [18 F]-DCFPyL PET data.  Results:   Good agreement is found between S-value kernels calculated using egs_mird with egs_internal_source and those found in the literature. Calculating 1000 doses (individual voxel uncertainties of ∼0.05%) in a voxel grid Fano test for monoenergetic 500 keV electrons and 177 Lu electrons results in 94% and 99% of the doses being within 0.1% of the expected dose, respectively. For a hypothetical 177 Lu treatment, patient prostate, rectum, bone marrow, and bladder dose volume histograms (DVHs) results did not vary significantly when using the TL estimator and not modeling electron transport, modeling bone marrow explicitly (rather than using generic tissue compositions), and reducing activity to voxels containing partial or full calcifications to half or none, respectively. Dose profiles through different regions demonstrate there are some differences with model choices not seen in the DVH. Simulations using the TL estimator can be completed in under 15 min (∼30 min when using standard interaction scoring).  Conclusion:   This work shows egs_mird to be a reliable MC code for computing TRT doses as realistically as the patient Computed Tomography (CT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data allow. Furthermore, the code can compute doses to sub-1% uncertainty within 15 min, with little to no optimization. Thus, this work supports the use of egs_mird for dose calculations in TRT.""","""['Martin P Martinov', 'Chidera Opara', 'Rowan M Thomson', 'Ting-Yim Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Differences among Monte Carlo codes in the calculations of voxel S values for radionuclide targeted therapy and analysis of their impact on absorbed dose evaluations.', 'Discrete beta dose kernel matrices for nuclides applied in targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) calculated with MCNP5.', 'Evaluation of dosimetric effects of metallic artifact reduction and tissue assignment on Monte Carlo dose calculations for 125 I prostate implants.', 'A Review on Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Preclinical Dosimetry in Targeted Radionuclide Therapy (TRT).', 'Developments in Combining Targeted Radionuclide Therapies and Immunotherapies for Cancer Treatment.']"""

Current guidelines recommend abdominopelvic imaging for new cases of CaP categorized as unfavorable intermediate risk (UIR) or higher. We assessed the performance characteristics of CT/MRI based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines and developed a model that predicts cN1 disease using conventional imaging.  Patients and methods:   We selected patients in the National Cancer Database diagnosed with CaP from 2010 to 2016 with available age, prostate specific antigen, clinical locoregional staging, biopsy Gleason grading, and core information. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR) was used on a undersampled training dataset using cN1 as the outcome. Performance characteristics were compared to those of the three most recent versions of the NCCN guidelines.  Results:   A total of 443,640 men were included, and 2.5% had cN1 disease. Using CT/MRI only, the current NCCN guidelines have a sensitivity of 99%, and the number needed to image (NNI) is 24. At the same sensitivity, the cN1 risk was 1.6% using the MLR. The NNI for UIR alone is 341. Using the MLR model and a threshold of 10%, the PPV is 10.3% and 64% of CTs/MRIs could be saved at a cost of missing 6% of cN1 patients (or 0.15% of all patients).  Conclusion:   The NCCN guidelines are sensitive for detecting cN1 with CT/MRI, however, the number needed to image is 24. Obtaining CT/MRI for nodal staging when patients have a cN1 risk of 10% would reduce total imaging while still remaining sensitive. As novel PET tracers becomes increasingly used for initial CaP staging, well calibrated prediction models trained on the outcome of interest should be developed as decision aids for obtaining imaging.""","""['Mitchell Hayes', 'Yun Yu', 'Solange Bassale', 'Nicholas Chakiryan', 'Yiyi Chen', 'Shangyuan Ye', 'Mark Garzotto', 'Ryan Kopp']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Is pelvic MRI imaging sufficient cross-sectional imaging for staging intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer?', '68 Ga-PSMA-PET/CT staging prior to definitive radiation treatment for prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'The Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in the Primary Staging of Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Literature.', 'Imaging and Management of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Metastatic prostate cancer is a rapidly evolving field with a complex landscape that has multiple established therapies, including chemotherapies, hormonal therapies, immunotherapies, radiopharmaceuticals, and targeted therapies. The current landscape was created by an important series of pivotal phase III trials, typically with an overall-survival endpoint. To best understand the VISION trial (performed on patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer), it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the key decisions that underpinned the design, as well as the context of those decisions. Here, we describe critical elements of the VISION phase III trial and how those elements will shape regulatory decision making and clinic practice. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were carefully crafted, as were treatments, assessments, and endpoints. The results of the VISION trial were impressive, with clear improvements in survival for patients having few treatment alternatives. Besides the significant progress, there are also significant limitations. 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatments will have far-reaching implications for prostate cancer.

It is imperative that older adults, especially those from historically marginalized backgrounds, be adequately represented in all stages of cancer research to address health inequities. Continued efforts and progress toward achieving social justice and health equity require a deeper commitment to and better understanding of the impact of social determinants of health within the cancer domain.

Methods and materials:   Using demographic and treatment-related features (m = 122) from patients (n = 2058) at 26 centers, we trained 8 ML algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation in a 50:50 random-split data set with class stratification to predict acute breast desquamation. Based on performance in the validation data set, the logistic model tree, random forest, and naïve Bayes models were taken forward to cost-sensitive learning optimisation.  Results:   One hundred and ninety-two patients experienced acute desquamation. Resampling and cost-sensitive learning optimisation facilitated an improvement in classification performance.

Our research centered on establishing a comprehensive correlation between the C262T variant and different cancers. This study was conducted using RevMan 5.4 software following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. For this meta-analysis, 53 case-control studies (18,258 cases and 47,476 controls) were chosen. The analysis revealed that three genetic models were statistically linked (P < 0.05) to overall cancer susceptibility in codominant model 2 (COD2): odds ratio (OR) = 1.16, COD3: OR = 1.21, recessive model (RM): OR = 1.20). After stratification by ethnicity, a significant link (P < 0.05) was found in Caucasians (COD2: OR = 1.18, COD3: OR = 1.17, over-dominant model (ODM): OR = 1.19) and Asians (COD3: OR = 1.49). Subgroup analyses revealed a significant correlation (P < 0.05) with blood-and-bone-marrow-related cancer, skin cancer, gastrointestinal-tract-related cancer, prostate cancer, and gynecologic cancer. Three genetic models in population-based controls (COD2: OR = 1.19, COD3: OR = 1.17, RM: OR = 1.19) and two genetic models in hospital-based controls (COD3: OR = 1.40, RM: OR = 1.24) were found to be significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with cancer. Also, three genetic models for polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (COD3: OR = 1.46; RM: OR = 1.34, ODM: OR = 0.80) and three models for MALDI-TOF + MassARRAY (COD2: OR = 1.32, RM: OR = 1.26, allele model: OR = 1.14) genotyping methods showed significant association (P < 0.05) with cancer. The meta-regression showed that the quality scores might be a source of significant heterogeneity under the COD2 model (coefficient = 0.176, P = 0.029). Trial sequential analysis also validated the adequacy of the sample size on overall findings. Our results indicate that CAT C262T variant is associated with overall cancer susceptibility, especially in Caucasians and Asians.

The absolute percentage of biopsied tissue positive for Gleason pattern 4 disease (APP4) is a possible prognostic measure. Here we sought to determine the impact of APP4 in a prospective multi-institutional pooled analysis of men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Materials and methods:   Patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with SBRT (40 Gy in five fractions or 26 Gy in two fractions) with or without androgen deprivation therapy treated on prospective clinical trials were included. Pathology reports were queried to obtain APP4, calculated as the percentage of Gleason pattern 4 disease within the tumour(s) multiplied by the percentage of total biopsied tissue positive for disease divided by 100. The optimal APP4 cut-off points for biochemical failure and distant metastasis were calculated and used as a stratification in the cumulative incidence of biochemical failure and distant metastasis. Multivariable competing risk models were developed.  Results:   In tota, 227 patients were included. The median follow-up was 56.5 months. The optimal APP4 cut-off points were 5% for biochemical failure and 20% for distant metastasis. At 4 years, the cumulative incidence of biochemical failure was 23.6% and 2.3% for APP4 >5% and ≤ 5%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of distant metastasis was 12.5% for APP4 >20% and 1% for APP4 ≤ 20% (P = 0.02). APP4 sub-stratified favourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer and unfavourable intermediate-risk prostate cancer into groups at similarly low and similarly high risk of biochemical failure and distant metastasis. On multivariable competing risk analysis, APP4 >5% (P = 0.0004) was significantly associated with biochemical failure, but APP4 (log) was not for distant metastasis (P = 0.08).  Conclusion:   APP4 may be an easily accessible promising prognostic measure for patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with SBRT.

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the overexpression of DDAH1 in PCa and examined its potential role as a therapeutic target. We observed that DDAH1expression is elevated in PCa (PC3, LNCaP, and DU145) cell lines under hypoxia. ChIP and reporter assay results confirmed that DDAH1 expression is positively regulated by HIF-1α through directly binding to the hypoxia response elements (HRE) located within the promoter region between - 1242/- 1238 upstream of its transcription start site (TSS). Under hypoxia, HIF-1α is translocated into the nucleus and activates its target gene expression in PC3 cells. Interestingly, in the event of HIF-1α inhibition or siRNA-mediated knockdown, an alternative transcription factor Nrf2 promotes DDAH1 expression through antioxidant response elements (AREs) on its promoter. ChIP assay results showed that Nrf2 binds to AREs located between -1016 / -1008 bp from the TSS of DDAH1. Furthermore, knockdown of PCa therapeutic target HSP90, an essential co-factor for both HIF-1α and Nrf2 causes attenuation of hypoxia induced DDAH1 overexpression in PCa cells. These results demonstrate that hypoxia induced upregulation of DDAH1 expression is positively regulated by HIF-1α and Nrf2 in association with HSP90. Therefore, targeting tumor angiogenesis promoting DDAH1 along with standard androgen receptor (AR) targeted therapy may offer an effective strategy to prevent PCa progression.""","""['Sakkarai Mohamed Asha Parveen', 'Sirisha Natani', 'Sruthi K K', 'Priyanka Khilar', 'Ramesh Ummanni']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Biochem Cell Biol""","""['Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) is frequently upregulated in prostate cancer, and its overexpression conveys tumor growth and angiogenesis by metabolizing asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA).', 'Novel Cellularly Active Inhibitor Regresses DDAH1 Induced Prostate Tumor Growth by Restraining Tumor Angiogenesis through Targeting DDAH1/ADMA/NOS Pathway.', 'DDAH1 plays dual roles in PM2.5 induced cell death in A549 cells.', 'Effects of acute hypoxia exposure with different durations on activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway in mouse skeletal muscle.', 'Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 in human breast and prostate cancer.', 'The association of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α and hypoxia-inducible factor-2α protein expression with clinicopathological characteristics in papillary thyroid carcinoma: A meta-analysis.']"""

Purity estimates have been shown to be critical for correction of tumor sequencing results, and higher purity samples allow for more accurate interpretations from next-generation sequencing results. Molecular-based purity estimates using computational approaches require sequencing of tumors, which is both time-consuming and expensive.  Methods:   Here we propose an approach, weakly-supervised purity (wsPurity), which can accurately quantify tumor purity within a digitally captured hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histological slide, using several types of cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as a proof-of-concept.  Findings:   Our model predicts cancer type with high accuracy on unseen cancer slides from TCGA and shows promising generalizability to unseen data from an external cohort (F1-score of 0.83 for prostate adenocarcinoma). In addition we compare performance of our model on tumor purity prediction with a comparable fully-supervised approach on our TCGA held-out cohort and show our model has improved performance, as well as generalizability to unseen frozen slides (0.1543 MAE on an independent test cohort). In addition to tumor purity prediction, our approach identified high resolution tumor regions within a slide, and can also be used to stratify tumors into high and low tumor purity, using different cancer-dependent thresholds.  Interpretation:   Overall, we demonstrate our deep learning model's different capabilities to analyze tumor H&E sections.

Methods:   Patient data from three randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III studies evaluating enzalutamide (AFFIRM, PREVAIL and PROSPER) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer were included in this analysis.

After adjusting for available clinical prognostic variables, multivariate analyses were performed on pooled data from AFFIRM and PREVAIL, all three trials pooled, and each trial individually, to assess differential efficacy in these end-points associated with the baseline use of these medications.  Results:   In the multivariate analysis of the individual trials, OS and rPFS/MFS were not significantly influenced by statin or metformin use in AFFIRM or PROSPER. However, in PREVAIL, OS was significantly influenced by statin (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.89) and rPFS was significantly influenced by metformin (HR, 0.48; 95% CI 0.34-0.70).

Materials and methods:   Post-HIFU MRIs of 110 consecutive patients who underwent follow-up biopsies between August 2019 and April 2021 were retrospectively analyzed and the likelihood of recurrence was assessed on a five-point Likert scale by two board-certified uroradiologists. Diagnostic performance of the Likert scale assigned to the post-HIFU MRI was assessed using the follow-up biopsy results as a reference standard. Among the clinical and radiological variables, predictors of the recurrence were examined through logistic regression.  Results:   In per-patient and per-sector analyses, Likert scale on post-HIFU MRI showed a sensitivity and specificity of 0.37 and 0.97, and 0.42 and 0.87, respectively, in predicting recurrence. Two patients with high suspicion on MRI required additional treatment to regain biochemical control despite negative biopsies. High suspicion on post-HIFU MRI (odds ratio = 1.74; p < 0.01), and more cancer-positive cores on initial biopsy (odds ratio = 1.25; p = 0.03) were independent predictors of recurrence.  Conclusion:   Albeit with low sensitivity, high suspicion on post-HIFU MRI may be clinically important because of its high specificity, especially when considering the possibility of sampling error in biopsies. Patients with a high number of cancer-positive cores at diagnosis should avoid HIFU as they have an increased risk of recurrence.""","""['Hyungwoo Ahn#', 'Sung Il Hwang#', 'Taek Min Kim', 'Hak Jong Lee', 'Gheeyoung Choe', 'Sung Kyu Hong', 'Seok-Soo Byun', 'Hakmin Lee']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Multiparametric MRI for Suspected Recurrent Prostate Cancer after HIFU:Is DCE still needed?', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MR Detects Local Recurrence Occult on mpMRI in Prostate Cancer Patients After HIFU.', 'High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) hemiablation of the prostate: Late follow-up MRI findings in non-recurrent patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Local Recurrence Reporting (PI-RR): International Consensus -based Guidelines on Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Prostate Cancer Recurrence after Radiation Therapy and Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Oncological results and cancer control definition in focal therapy\xa0for Prostate Cancer: a systematic review.', 'Functional outcomes and safety of focal therapy for prostate cancer: a systematic review on results and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).']"""

However, there is still a lack of profound characterizations of seed motions within the prostate. We assessed these dynamics between day 0 and day 30 of brachytherapy.  Methods:   We considered 45 patients with 2408 implanted seeds, and performed a 1:1 assignment between their positions on post-plan CT (nominal day 30) and intraoperative ultrasound (day 0). Geometric seed arrangement changes were measured for each patient and the entire collective. The impact of seed strand-lengths and implant regions was investigated. Correlations with patient characteristics were evaluated. We determined corresponding dosimetric effects by calculating common dose metrics.  Results:   We found a median seed displacement of 4.3 mm [interquartile range: 3.1-6.9 mm], occurring preferentially in superior-inferior direction. Single and double strands moved significantly stronger than strands of higher lengths. Seed dynamics was more pronounced in base (5.6 mm [3.7-10.7 mm]) and apex (6.5 mm [4.1-15.0 mm]) than in the mid-gland (3.8 mm [2.7-5.0 mm]), and less pronounced in peripheral (4.3 mm [3.0-6.7 mm]) than in urethra-near (5.5 mm [3.5-10.7 mm]) regions. Correlations of seed dynamics with prostate volume changes and the number of implanted seeds and needles were found. D90 (dose that 90% of the prostate receives) varied by a median of 3 Gy [-6 to 15 Gy] between treatment plan and post-plan, but >40 Gy for individual patients.  Conclusions:   Reducing seed dynamics is important to ensure a high treatment quality. For this, strands containing ≥3 seeds may be useful, implantations in base-, apex-, and urethra-near zone should be avoided, and the number of needles and seeds may be minimized where possible.""","""['Andre Karius', 'Michael Lotter', 'Stephan Kreppner', 'Verena Schaller', 'Dorota Lubgan', 'Johanna Grigo', 'Rainer Fietkau', 'Vratislav Strnad', 'Christoph Bert']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['Seed-displacements in the immediate post-implant phase in permanent prostate brachytherapy.', 'Prostate seed implantation using 3D-computer assisted intraoperative planning vs. a standard look-up nomogram: Improved target conformality with reduction in urethral and rectal wall dose.', 'Seed displacements after permanent brachytherapy for prostate cancer in dependence on the prostate level.', 'Dosimetry Modeling for Focal Low-Dose-Rate Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.']"""

Methods:   Two-hundred and eighty patients treated with EBRT for prostate cancer were included in the present study. Toxicity was scored following the grading system based on Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) scale. International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS) and Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaires - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) were used to analyse self-reported symptoms. Acute and late urinary toxicities were correlated to clinical and treatment parameters, radiation dosimetry data, IPSS and ICIQ-SF.  Results:   Median patient age was 74 years (range, 64-83). Thirty-one percent experienced acute G1 urinary toxicity, 24% G2 and 3% G3. Fourteen percent experienced G1 late urinary toxicity and 3% G2. Bladder volume<200 cc was associated with acute urinary toxicity (P=0.014); use of MRI for treatment planning allowed a lower incidence of late toxicity (P=0.062) and use of IMRT allowed for reduced incidence in late toxicity (P=0.038). Maximum bladder dose correlated with late urinary toxicity (P=0.014). The analysis of self-reported symptoms showed a significant correlation between IPSS baseline values (P=0.009), presence of nocturia (P=0.002), bladder urgency (P=0.024) and incontinence (P=0.024) and development of acute urinary toxicity at univariate analysis. At multivariate logistic regression analysis, bladder filling, IPSS value, nocturia, and urinary incontinence retained significant correlation with acute toxicity (P=0.0003).

Following the strong clinical evidence for the utility of DNA-sequencing-based HRD testing in ovarian cancer, and growing evidence in breast cancer, we present analytical validation of the Tempus HRD-DNA test. We further developed, validated, and explored the Tempus HRD-RNA model, which uses gene expression data from 16,750 RNA-seq samples to predict HRD status from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples across numerous cancer types.  Methods:   Genomic and transcriptomic profiling was performed using next-generation sequencing from Tempus xT, Tempus xO, Tempus xE, Tempus RS, and Tempus RS.v2 assays on 48,843 samples. Samples were labeled based on their BRCA1, BRCA2 and selected Homologous Recombination Repair pathway gene (CDK12, PALB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D) mutational status to train and validate HRD-DNA, a genome-wide loss-of-heterozygosity biomarker, and HRD-RNA, a logistic regression model trained on gene expression.  Results:   In a sample of 2058 breast and 1216 ovarian tumors, BRCA status was predicted by HRD-DNA with F1-scores of 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. Across an independent set of 1363 samples across solid tumor types, the HRD-RNA model was predictive of BRCA status in prostate, pancreatic, and non-small cell lung cancer, with F1-scores of 0.88, 0.69, and 0.62, respectively.

The mathematical model is based on a Cahn-Hilliard diffuse interface description of the tumour, coupled with Keller-Segel type equations describing immune components dynamics. The model is fed by pre-clinical magnetic resonance imaging data describing anatomical features of prostate adenocarcinoma developed in the context of the Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate model. We perform computational simulations based on the finite element method to describe tumor growth dynamics in relation to local T cells concentrations. We report that when we include in the model the possibility to activate tumor-associated vessels and by that increase the number of T cells within the tumor mass, the model predicts higher therapeutic effects (tumor regression) shortly after therapy administration. The simulated results are found in agreement with reported experimental data. Thus, this diffuse-interface mathematical model well predicts T cell behavior in vivo and represents a proof-of-concept for the role such predictive strategies may play in optimization of immunotherapy against cancer.""","""['G Pozzi', 'B Grammatica', 'L Chaabane', 'M Catucci', 'A Mondino', 'P Zunino', 'P Ciarletta']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Theor Biol""","""['Protective immunosurveillance and therapeutic antitumor activity of gammadelta T cells demonstrated in a mouse model of prostate cancer.', 'Targeted hypoxia reduction restores T cell infiltration and sensitizes prostate cancer to immunotherapy.', 'Cross-Talk between Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Mast Cells Mediates Tumor-Specific Immunosuppression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate cancer, tumor immunity and a renewed sense of optimism in immunotherapy.', 'Prospects and limitations of recombinant poxviruses for prostate cancer immunotherapy.']"""

The Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for the Comprehensive Treatment of Oligometastases (SABR-COMET) randomized phase 2 trial was originally designed with 5 years of follow-up, but the trial was amended in 2016 to extend follow-up to 10 years. Herein we report oncologic outcomes beyond 5 years.  Methods and materials:   Patients were eligible if they had a controlled primary tumor and 1 to 5 metastases, with all metastases amenable to SABR. Patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio between palliative standard-of-care treatment (control arm) versus SABR to all metastases plus standard of care (SABR arm). The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), toxicity, quality of life (using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: General [FACT-G]), and time to new metastases.  Results:   Ninety-nine patients were randomized between 2012 and 2016 (n = 33 in arm 1 vs n = 66 in arm 2). Primary tumor sites included lung (n = 18), breast (n = 18), colon (n = 18), prostate (n = 16), and other (n = 29). Eight-year OS was 27.2% in the SABR arm versus 13.6% in the control arm (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.84; P = .008). Eight-year PFS estimates were 21.3% versus 0.0%, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.28-0.72; P < .001). Rates of grade ≥ 2 acute or late toxic effects were 30.3% versus 9.1% (P = .019), with no new grade 3 to 5 toxic effects. FACT-G quality of life scores declined over time in both arms, but there were no differences in quality of life scores between arms. The use of systemic therapy overall was similar between arms, but patients in the SABR arm were less likely to require cytotoxic chemotherapy (33.3% vs 54.6%, respectively, P = .043).

We quantitatively define nine functional nucleosome states each with specific characteristic nucleosome footprints in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Interestingly, we observe dynamic switches among nucleosome states upon androgen stimulation, accompanied by distinct differential (gained or lost) binding of FOXA1, GATA2, H1 as well as many other coregulators. Intriguingly, we reveal a noncanonical pioneer model of GATA2 that it initially functions as a PF binding at the edge of a nucleosome in an inaccessible crowding array. Upon androgen stimulation, GATA2 re-configures an inaccessible to accessible nucleosome state and subsequently acts as a master transcription factor either directly or recruits signaling specific transcription factors to enhance WNT signaling in an androgen receptor (AR)-independent manner.

In this study, we defined patients with BPH as belonging to the accelerated progressive group (transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] surgery at ≤50 years old), normal-speed progressive group (TURP surgery at ≥70 years old), or non-progressive group (age ≤50 years old without BPH-related surgery). We enrolled prostate specimens from the three groups of patients and compared these tissues to determine the histopathological characteristics and molecular mechanisms underlying BPH patients with accelerated progression. We found that the main histopathological characteristics of accelerated progressive BPH tissues were increased stromal components and prostatic fibrosis, which were accompanied by higher myofibroblast accumulation and collagen deposition. Mechanism dissection demonstrated that these accelerated progressive BPH tissues have higher expression of the CYP19 and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with higher estrogen biosynthesis. Estrogen functions via GPER/Gαi signaling to modulate the EGFR/ERK and HIF-1α/TGF-β1 signaling to increase prostatic stromal cell proliferation and prostatic stromal fibrosis.

Methods:   A prospective cohort study of 28,737 Seventh-day Adventist men in the United States and Canada, of whom 6389 were of black ethnicity. Diet was measured by FFQ, and 275 male participants also provided repeated 24-h dietary recalls as a calibration substudy. Incident cancers were mainly found by matching with cancer registries. Analyses used multivariable proportional hazards regressions and regression calibration for some analyses.  Results:   In total, 1254 (190 advanced) incident prostate cancer cases were found during an average 7.8 y of follow-up.

Similar findings, comparing the same g/d intakes, were demonstrated for advanced prostate cancers (HR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.88), for nonadvanced cases (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.45), in black participants (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.58), and when excluding vegan participants (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.43). Calibrated dairy (g/d) regressions (all participants and all prostate cancers), adjusting for dietary measurement error, found a HR of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.32, 2.32). Comparing 90th percentile intake to zero intakes (uncalibrated), the HR was 1.62 (95% CI: 1.26, 2.05). There was no evidence of an effect of higher (905 mg/d) compared with lower (349 mg/d) intakes of nondairy calcium (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 0.94, 1.44).  Conclusions:   Men with higher intake of dairy foods, but not nondairy calcium, had a higher risk of prostate cancer compared with men having lower intakes.

However, the risk of developing new distant metastatic lesions remains high, and only a minority of patients experience durable progression-free response. Therefore, there is a critical need to identify which patients will benefit from SABR alone versus combination SABR and systemic agents. Herein we provide, to our knowledge, the first proof-of-concept of circulating prostate cancer-specific extracellular vesicles (PCEVs) as a noninvasive predictor of outcomes in oligometastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (omCRPC) treated with SABR.  Methods and materials:   We analyzed the levels and kinetics of PCEVs in the peripheral blood of 79 patients with omCRPC at baseline and days 1, 7, and 14 after SABR using nanoscale flow cytometry and compared with baseline values from cohorts with localized and widely metastatic prostate cancer. The association of omCRPC PCEV levels with oncological outcomes was determined with Cox regression models.  Results:   Levels of PCEVs were highest in mCRPC followed by omCRPC and were lowest in localized prostate cancer. High PCEV levels at baseline predicted a shorter median time to distant recurrence (3.5 vs 6.6 months; P = .0087). After SABR, PCEV levels peaked on day 7, and median overall survival was significantly longer in patients with elevated PCEV levels (32.7 vs 27.6 months; P = .003). This suggests that pretreatment PCEV levels reflect tumor burden, whereas early changes in PCEV levels after treatment predict response to SABR. In contrast, radiomic features of 11C-choline positron emission tomography and computed tomography before and after SABR were not predictive of clinical outcomes. Interestingly, PCEV levels and peripheral tumor-reactive CD8 T cells (TTR; CD8+ CD11ahigh) were correlated.  Conclusions:   This original study demonstrates that circulating PCEVs can serve as prognostic and predictive markers to SABR to identify patients with ""true"" omCRPC. In addition, it provides novel insights into the global crosstalk, mediated by PCEVs, between tumors and immune cells that leads to systemic suppression of immunity against CRPC. This work lays the foundation for future studies to investigate the underpinnings of metastatic progression and provide new therapeutic targets (eg, PCEVs) to improve SABR efficacy and clinical outcomes in treatment-resistant CRPC.""","""['Fabrice Lucien', 'Yohan Kim', 'Jing Qian', 'Jacob J Orme', 'Henan Zhang', 'Ali Arafa', 'Feven Abraha', 'Ishwor Thapa', 'Erik J Tryggestad', 'William S Harmsen', 'Jorgena Kosti', 'Hesham Ali', 'Val J Lowe', 'Geoff B Johnson', 'Eugene D Kwon', 'Haidong Dong', 'Sean S Park']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Phase II Evaluation of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR) and Immunity in 11C-Choline-PET/CT-Identified Oligometastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Outcomes of Observation vs Stereotactic Ablative Radiation for Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer: The ORIOLE Phase 2 Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Metastasis-directed Therapy Prolongs Efficacy of Systemic Therapy and Improves Clinical Outcomes in Oligoprogressive Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of radiotherapy in oligometastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'A Radiomics-Based Classifier for the Progression of Oropharyngeal Cancer Treated with Definitive Radiotherapy.']"""

In addition, P1 displayed strong anti-interference ability and good tumor imaging capacity in vivo, contributing to effective diagnosis of CRPC. Mechanistic studies, including high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, showed that the introduction of a nitro group quenched the probe fluorescence by inducing a PET effect, while in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, reduction of the nitro group blocked the PET effect and turned on the probe fluorescence.

In this final analysis, we report long-term findings on the primary outcome measure of OS and on the secondary outcome measures of symptomatic local events, RT toxicity events, and quality of life (QoL).  Methods and findings:   Patients were randomised at secondary care sites in the United Kingdom and Switzerland between January 2013 and September 2016, with 1:1 stratified allocation: 1,029 to standard of care (SOC) and 1,032 to SOC+RT. No masking of the treatment allocation was employed. A total of 1,939 had metastatic burden classifiable, with 42% low burden and 58% high burden, balanced by treatment allocation. Intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses used Cox regression and flexible parametric models (FPMs), adjusted for stratification factors age, nodal involvement, the World Health Organization (WHO) performance status, regular aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use, and planned docetaxel use. QoL in the first 2 years on trial was assessed using prospectively collected patient responses to QLQ-30 questionnaire. Patients were followed for a median of 61.3 months. Prostate RT improved OS in patients with low, but not high, metastatic burden (respectively: 202 deaths in SOC versus 156 in SOC+RT, hazard ratio (HR) = 0·64, 95% CI 0.52, 0.79, p < 0.001; 375 SOC versus 386 SOC+RT, HR = 1.11, 95% CI 0.96, 1.28, p = 0·164; interaction p < 0.001). No evidence of difference in time to symptomatic local events was found. There was no evidence of difference in Global QoL or QLQ-30 Summary Score. Long-term urinary toxicity of grade 3 or worse was reported for 10 SOC and 10 SOC+RT; long-term bowel toxicity of grade 3 or worse was reported for 15 and 11, respectively.  Conclusions:   Prostate RT improves OS, without detriment in QoL, in men with low-burden, newly diagnosed, metastatic prostate cancer, indicating that it should be recommended as a SOC.

Methods:   This single-center prospective study cohort included 162 males with suspected prostate cancer, who underwent 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI (3T-mpMRI). Two abdominal radiologists, blinded to the clinical information, separately reviewed each 3T-mpMRI study to rank geometrical distortion, degree of rectal distention, lesion conspicuity, and anatomic details delineation first on ss-EPI-DWI and later on RESOLVE-DWI using 5-point scales (1 = excellent, 5 = poor). The average of the ranking scores given by two readers was generated and used as the final score.  Results:   There was good-to-excellent interreader agreement for scoring image quality parameters on both ss-EPI and RESOLVE. Geometrical distortion scores > 3 was seen in 12.3% (20/162) of ss-EPI images, with all having geometrical distortion score <3 on RESOLVE (p < .001). The mean image distortion score was significantly less on RESOLVE than ss-EPI (1.16 vs 1.61, p < .01 regardless of rectal gas, p< .05 when stratified by the degree of rectal distention ). RESOLVE was superior to ss-EPI for lesion conspicuity (mean 1.35 vs 1.53, p< .002) and anatomic delineation (2.60 vs 2.68, p< .001) of prostate on DWI.  Conclusion:   Compared to conventional ss-EPI, the use of RESOLVE for acquisition of prostate DWI resulted in significantly enhanced image quality and reduced geometrical distortion.

The significance of other PI3K pathway components in prostate cancer is largely unknown.  Experimental design:   Patients in this study underwent tumor sequencing using the MSK-IMPACT clinical assay to capture single-nucleotide variants, insertions, and deletions; copy-number alterations; and structural rearrangements, or were profiled through The Cancer Genome Atlas. The association between PIK3R1 alteration/expression and survival was evaluated using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models. We used the siRNA-based knockdown of PIK3R1 for functional studies. FDG-PET/CT examinations were performed with a hybrid positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanner for some prostate cancer patients in the MSK-IMPACT cohort.  Results:   Analyzing 1,417 human prostate cancers, we found a significant enrichment of PIK3R1 alterations in metastatic cancers compared with primary cancers. PIK3R1 alterations or reduced mRNA expression tended to be associated with worse clinical outcomes in prostate cancer, particularly in primary disease, as well as in breast, gastric, and several other cancers. In prostate cancer cell lines, PIK3R1 knockdown resulted in increased cell proliferation and AKT activity, including insulin-stimulated AKT activity. In cell lines and organoids, PIK3R1 loss/mutation was associated with increased sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. PIK3R1-altered patient prostate tumors had increased uptake of the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose in PET imaging, suggesting increased glycolysis.

Impaired urethral sphincter function is generally considered to be the most important contributing factor for UI; however, the mechanism of onset and recovery of urinary continence has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this research was to evaluate preoperative functional urethral length (FUL) and maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) as early continence recovery predictors after open retropubic RP (ORRP).  Methods:   The research was conducted on a group of 43 patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) in the period from July 2019 to May 2021. The urodynamic method of urethral pressure profile (UPP) was used to assess FUL and MUCP, and correlate with the postprostatectomy continence recovery. The severity of UI and bothersome were assessed using fully validated International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF) and number of pads used in 24 h. Patients were interviewed about the use of urinary pads and asked to fill out the ICIQ-UI SF before and 2, 8, 16 and 24 weeks after ORRP.  Results:   The median value of FUL (mm) and MUCP (cmH2O) was 69 (28-94) and 76 (16-223), respectively. Correlation and linear regression showed a statistically significant negative correlation between preoperative values of FUL and MUCP with ICIQ symptom score and the number of pads used per day at the four observed time intervals (p < 0.05). Such a result showed that patients with higher preoperative FUL and MUCP values were more likely to recover urinary continence earlier. A value of 65 mm for FUL and 80 cmH2 O for MUCP proved to be the cut-off values for continence recovery in 24 weeks after ORRP.  Conclusion:   Preoperatively evaluated FUL and MUCP seem to be valuable prognostic factors for early continence recovery after ORRP.

Methods:   Image data from 26 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated using hypofractionated MRIgART (5 fractions per patient) were collected retrospectively. Daily pretreatment T2-weighted MRI was performed using a 1.5-T MRI system integrated into a Unity MR-linac. First-fraction image and contour data from 16 patients (80 image-sets) were used to train the population AS model, and the remaining 10 patients composed the test set. The proposed personalized AS framework contained two main steps. First, a convolutional neural network was employed to train the population model using the training set. Second, for each test patient, the population model was progressively fine-tuned with manually checked delineations of the patient's current and previous fractions to obtain a personalized model that was applied to the next fraction.  Results:   Compared with the population model, the personalized models substantially improved the mean Dice similarity coefficient from 0.79 to 0.93 for the prostate clinical target volume (CTV), 0.91 to 0.97 for the bladder, 0.82 to 0.92 for the rectum, and 0.91 to 0.93 for the femoral heads, respectively.

Aim:   to investigate LEL immediately adjacent to prostatic CI.  Methods:   We studied LEL in 144 prostatic surgical and autopsy specimens in various types of prostatic CI: NIH-category IV prostatitis (histologic prostatitis-HP), nonspecific granulomatous prostatitis (NSGP), and the reactive lymphoid infiltrates in the vicinity of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa).

Results:   LEL was identified in all types of prostatic specimens and in all types of prostatic CI: in 70.9% of patients with HP; in 100% of cases with NSGP; in 68.7% and in 80% adjacent to BPH and PCa respectively. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation of the presence of LEL with HG CI (p<0.001). LEL showed strong membranous PD-L1 expression.  Conclusions:   The study presents the first attempt to examine LEL in inflammatory human prostate.

The study purpose was to assess current beliefs among family medicine and internal medicine physicians regarding effectiveness of various types of cancer screening. A national sample of 582 physicians from the American Medical Association's Physician Masterfile were surveyed. Participants were asked about their perceived effectiveness of screening for colon, lung, breast, prostate, and cervical cancer among average, healthy individuals. Chi-square tests were conducted to assess relationships between perceiving screening tests to be 'very effective in reducing cancer-related mortality' and demographic characteristics. A substantial majority of physicians perceived colonoscopy (83.8%) and Pap smear (82.9%) to be very effective. Perceiving low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), Pap smear, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) as 'very effective' differed by gender, with females less likely to endorse LDCT and Pap smear but more likely to endorse PSA. Perceiving PSA as 'very effective' differed by age and graduation year, with younger or more recently graduated physicians being less likely to perceive PSA as 'very effective'. Non-Hispanic Black/African-American physicians were more likely to perceive mammography as 'very effective' than other groups.

However, the role of CXCL14 in prostate cancer (PC) has not been fully investigated. In this study, the expression of CXCL14 was determined in PC tumor tissues by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry assay. Wound healing, invasion, colony formation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis assays were performed to evaluate the role of CXCL14 in PC progression. Exosomes were isolated from PC cell-condition medium by using ultracentrifugation assay and identified by using transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. M2 macrophage polarization-associated genes were measured by using qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. A PC xenograft mouse model was used to assess the role of CXCL14 in tumor growth in vivo. The results showed that CXCL14 was significantly upregulated in PC tissues and was positively correlated with pathological stages, lymph node metastasis, and angiolymphatic invasion. The positive correlations were also observed between CXCL14 and PD-L1 and IL-10. Knockdown CXCL14 dramatically inhibited PC cell proliferation, invasion, and colony formation, but not apoptosis. CXCL14 promoted M2 macrophage polarization through the NF-κB signaling pathway and exosome-mediated mechanism. Moreover, CXCL14 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo.

For those undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), substantial increases in fat mass are observed in the first year of treatment. Recently, we showed that a targeted supervised clinic-based exercise and nutrition intervention can result in a substantial reduction in fat mass with muscle mass preserved in ADT-treated patients. However, the intervention needs to be accessible to all patients and not just those who can access a supervised clinic-based programme. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth delivered compared with supervised clinic-based delivered exercise and nutrition intervention in overweight/obese patients with prostate cancer.  Methods and analysis:   A single-blinded, two-arm parallel group, non-inferiority randomised trial will be undertaken with 104 overweight/obese men with prostate cancer (body fat percentage ≥25%) randomly allocated in a ratio of 1:1 to a telehealth-delivered, virtually supervised exercise and nutrition programme or a clinic-based, face-to-face supervised exercise and nutrition programme. Exercise will consist of supervised resistance and aerobic exercise performed three times a week plus additional self-directed aerobic exercise performed 4 days/week for the first 6 months. Thereafter, for months 7-12, the programmes will be self-managed. The primary endpoint will be fat mass. Secondary endpoints include lean mass and abdominal aortic calcification, anthropometric measures and blood pressure assessment, objective measures of physical function and physical activity levels, patient-reported outcomes and blood markers. Measurements will be undertaken at baseline, 6 months (post intervention), and at 12 months of follow-up. Data will be analysed using intention-to-treat and per protocol approaches.

Deviations from consensus contouring guidelines included incomplete coverage of involved vertebral compartments, omission of adjacent compartments, or unnecessary circumferential coverage. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed using death as a competing risk.  Results:   283 patients with 360 discrete lesions were included with a median follow up of 14.6 months (range 1.2-131.3). The prescription dose was 24-27 Gy in 2-3 fractions for the majority of lesions. Median survival after SBRT was 18.3 months (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 14.8-22.8). The 1 and 2-year local control (LC) rates were 81.1 % (95 % CI: 75.5-85.6 %) and 70.6 % (95 % CI: 63.2-76.8 %), respectively.

Results:   We identified 54,286 men with prostate cancer and a comparison cohort of 249,645 age-matched men. The new prescription rate for BPH drugs increased for men with prostate cancer in the year before diagnosis and peaked 1 month before diagnosis with an 18-fold higher rate. Men with prostate cancer had a higher total prescription rate of BPH drugs 3 years before diagnosis, notably among men with localized disease. Before diagnosis, the new prescription rates for ED drugs were similar among men with prostate cancer and comparisons. After diagnosis, men with prostate cancer had a 7-fold higher rate of new prescriptions for ED drugs. Among men with localized disease, the total prescription rate of ED drugs increased in the months following diagnosis.  Conclusion:   Differences in prescription rates suggest increased prostate cancer surveillance among men receiving BPH drugs, whereas the post-diagnostic increase in ED drugs among men with localized disease is compatible with the increased risk of ED following prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Anne Katrine Duun-Henriksen', 'Christian Dehlendorff', 'Martin Andreas Røder', 'Charlotte Skriver', 'Anton Pottegård', 'Søren Friis', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Signe Benzon Larsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Drug prescription for erectile dysfunction before and after diagnosis of localized prostate cancer.', 'Association Between Erectile Dysfunction and Subsequent Prostate Cancer Development: A Population-Based Cohort Study With Double Concurrent Comparison Groups.', 'Identifying patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia through a diagnosis of, or treatment for, erectile dysfunction.', 'Erectile Dysfunction and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms.', 'PDE5: A new therapeutic target for lower urinary tract symptoms/ benign prostatic hyperplasia combined with erectile dysfunction.']"""

African American (AA) men have lower engagement in GT, with concern for widening disparities in genetically informed care. We evaluated the germline spectrum in a cohort of men with PCA enriched for AA men who underwent GT to inform tailored genetic evaluation strategies.  Methods:   Participants included AA and White men with PCA tested with a 14-gene PCA panel: ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, EPCAM, HOXB13, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, RAD51D, and TP53. Germline analysis was performed per standard clinical testing and variant classification protocols. Data were compared with Fisher's exact, chi-squared, or two sample t-tests, as appropriate. Multivariable analysis was conducted using Akaike's Information Criterion. The significance level was set a priori at .05.  Results:   The data set included 427 men all tested using the 14-gene PCA panel: AA (n = 237, 56%) and White (n = 190, 44%). Overall, the pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant rate was 8.2%, with AA men having lower rates of P/LP variants then White men (5.91% v 11.05%, respectively; P = .05). Borderline associations with P/LP variant status were observed by race (AA v White; odds ratio = 0.51; P = .07) and age (> 50 v ≤ 50 years; odds ratio = 0.48; P = .06). The P/LP spectrum was narrower in AA men (BRCA2, PALB2, ATM, and BRCA1) than White men (BRCA2, ATM, HOXB13, CHEK2, TP53, and NBN). A significant difference was noted in rates of variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) between AA men and White men overall (25.32% v 16.32%; P = .02) and for carrying multiple VUSs (5.1% v 0.53%, P = .008).  Conclusion:   Germline evaluation in a cohort enriched for AA men highlights the narrower spectrum of germline contribution to PCA with significantly higher rates of multiple VUSs in DNA repair genes. These results underscore the imperative to engage AA men in GT, the need for larger panel testing in AA men, and the necessity to incorporate novel genomic technologies to clarify VUS to discern the germline contribution to PCA. Furthermore, tailored genetic counseling for AA men is important to ensure understanding of VUS and promote equitable genetics care delivery.""","""['Veda N Giri', 'Rebecca Hartman', 'Mary Pritzlaff', 'Carrie Horton', 'Scott W Keith']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['Ethnic disparities among men with prostate cancer undergoing germline testing.', 'Internet-Based Germline Genetic Testing for Men With Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Prevalence of Suspected Hereditary Cancer Syndromes and Germline Mutations Among a Diverse Cohort of Probands Reporting a Family History of Prostate Cancer: Toward Informing Cascade Testing for Men.', 'Genetic testing for hereditary prostate cancer: Current status and limitations.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Investigation of Clinically Significant Molecular Aberrations in Patients with Prostate Cancer: Implications for Personalized Treatment, Prognosis and Genetic Testing.', 'Germline Variants in DNA Damage Repair Genes and HOXB13 Among Black Patients With Early-Onset Prostate Cancer.', ""Role of Olaparib in the Management of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Japanese Clinician's Perspective.""]"""

Here we develop an approach based on multispectral deep-ultraviolet (UV) microscopy that provides novel quantitative insight into the aggressiveness and grade of this disease, thus providing a new tool to help address this important challenge. We find that UV spectral signatures from endogenous molecules give rise to a phenotypical continuum that provides unique structural insight (i.e., molecular maps or ""optical stains"") of thin tissue sections with subcellular (nanoscale) resolution. We show that this phenotypical continuum can also be applied as a surrogate biomarker of prostate cancer malignancy, where patients with the most aggressive tumors show a ubiquitous glandular phenotypical shift. In addition to providing several novel ""optical stains"" with contrast for disease, we also adapt a two-part Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network to translate the label-free deep-UV images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained images, thus providing multiple stains (including the gold-standard H&E) from the same unlabeled specimen. Agreement between the virtual H&E images and the H&E-stained tissue sections is evaluated by a panel of pathologists who find that the two modalities are in excellent agreement. This work has significant implications towards improving our ability to objectively quantify prostate cancer grade and aggressiveness, thus improving the management and clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients. This same approach can also be applied broadly in other tumor types to achieve low-cost, stain-free, quantitative histopathological analysis.""","""['Soheil Soltani', 'Ashkan Ojaghi', 'Hui Qiao', 'Nischita Kaza', 'Xinyang Li', 'Qionghai Dai', 'Adeboye O Osunkoya', 'Francisco E Robles']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Use of Deep Learning to Develop and Analyze Computational Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining of Prostate Core Biopsy Images for Tumor Diagnosis.', 'Virtual microscopy in prostate histopathology: simultaneous viewing of biopsies stained sequentially with hematoxylin and eosin, and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase/p63 immunohistochemistry.', 'A large-scale internal validation study of unsupervised virtual trichrome staining technologies on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis liver biopsies.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Issues in using whole slide imaging for diagnostic pathology: ""routine"" stains, immunohistochemistry and predictive markers.', 'Compact and low-cost deep-ultraviolet microscope system for label-free molecular imaging and point-of-care hematological analysis.', 'Deep learning-enabled virtual histological staining of biological samples.', 'Unsupervised segmentation of biomedical hyperspectral image data: tackling high dimensionality with convolutional autoencoders.', 'Building predictive disease models using extracellular vesicle microscale flow cytometry and machine learning.', 'Segmentation and Recognition of the Pathological Features of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin Based on Multispectral Imaging.']"""

The toxicity and inhibitory concentration (IC50) of OENE toward prostate cancer by MTT analysis were performed. The lipid biogenesis mediated, molecular target pathway analyses were performed using fluorescence cellular staining techniques, real-time RT-PCR, or western blotting analysis. OENE showed IC50 at 13.82 µg/mL and significantly induced distinct morphological changes, including cell shrinkage, cell density, and cell shape reduction. In addition, OENE could also significantly decreased lipid droplet accumulation which was confirmed by studying mRNA transcripts of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) (0.31-fold), fatty acid synthase (FASN) (0.18-fold), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREPB1) (0.11-fold), respectively.

Materials and methods:   This study reviewed patients diagnosed with localized prostate adenocarcinoma between 2005 and 2016, and treated with EBRT on a Varian linear accelerator at one of the four cancer centers in Alberta, Canada. BFFS was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and EBRT treatment planning and delivery factors, were collected for each patient. The patient cohort was split into a training dataset with patients from two centers and a validation dataset with patients from another two centers. A random survival forest was used to identify features associated with BFFS.  Results:   This study included 2827 patients with a median follow-up of 6.4 years. The BFFS for this cohort collectively was 84.9% at 5 years and 69.3% at 10 years. 2519 patients from two centers were used for model training and 308 patients from two different centers were used for model validation. The prognostic features were Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis, clinical T stage, CTV D99, pelvic irradiation, IGRT frequency, and PTV V98. Variables including bladder volume, dose calculation algorithm, PTV D99, age at diagnosis, hip prosthesis, number of malignancies, fiducial marker usage, PTV volume, RT modality, PTV HI, rectal volume, hormone treatment, PTV D1cc, equivalent PTV margin, IGRT type, and EQD2_1.5 were unlikely to be prognostic. A random survival forest using only the seven prognostic variables was built. The Harrell's concordance index for the model was 0.65 for the whole training dataset, 0.62 for out-of-bag samples of the training dataset, and 0.62 for the validation dataset.

Using a national all-payer database, we assessed the burden of PFx secondary to mCaP and mRCa nationwide. Admission rates, mortality, surgical fixation rates, and risk factors for high-cost admissions for pathologic fractures were assessed METHODS: National Inpatient Sample was queried from 2013 to 2015 for mCaP and mRCa admissions. Hospitalization costs of PFx was assessed over time by cancer type. Hospitalization outcomes were stratified by cancer type. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to examine predictors of high-cost admission for PFx (>75th percentile).  Results:   From 2013 to 2015, there were 21,466 and 6,334 admissions for mCaP and mRCa with bone metastasis, respectively. Proportion of admissions for PFx was greater in mRCa than mCaP (15.9% vs. 7.2%, P < 0.01). PFx secondary to mRCa was associated with longer length of stay, hospitalization cost, and greater rate of surgical fixation. Costs of admission for PFx increased by $4,005 dollars from 2013 to 2015 for mRCa (P = 0.03), but did not increase for mCaP (P = 0.5). On multivariable analysis, mRCa was associated with greater odds of PFx (OR:2.12, P < 0.01), and high-cost hospitalization for mRCa associated PFx (OR:1.37, P = 0.02).  Conclusions:   PFx secondary to mRCa represents a significant health care burden. mRCa was associated with greater odds of PFx compared to mCaP, as well as greater inpatient morbidity and cost.

Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients who underwent robotic RP between 2016 and 2020. All patients underwent a 1.5-T mp-MRI according to the PI-RADS-v2 scoring system. RP specimens were examined with the whole-mount technique. csCaP definition: any tumor with a volume larger than 0.5 cm3 or with a Gleason score ≥7. Univariable logistic regression models explored the association between clinical and imaging data and the risk of csCaP. Significant variables (P < 0.05) were selected into multivariable regression models to identify independent predictors. A nomogram was designed to select the significant relevant predictors. The nomogram was internally validated in terms of discrimination and calibration. Receiver operating characteristics of the area under the curve was used to assess the discrimination ability of the nomogram. To assess the predictive performance of mpMRI, the accuracy of the mpMRI-based nomogram was compared with that excluding either PI-RADS score or mpMRI IL size.

By blocking the functional activity of SGLT2, SGLT2 inhibitors have shown anticancer effects in several malignant cancers, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, hepatocellular cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer. However, the anticancer effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in osteosarcoma and the specific mechanism are still unclear. In the present study, we found that SGLT2 was overexpressed at the protein level in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, our results showed that the SGLT2 inhibitor significantly inhibited osteosarcoma tumor growth and induced infiltration of immune cells in vivo by upregulating STING expression and activating the IRF3/IFN-β pathway, which could attribute to the suppression of AKT phosphorylation. In addition, the combined treatment with SGLT2 inhibitor and STING agonist 2'3'-cGAMP exerted synergistic antitumor effects in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, the overexpression of SGLT2 at the protein level was correlated with the degradation of SGLT2 induced by TRIM21.

Almost all malignancies can metastasize to the skeleton but 80% of bone metastases originate from breast, prostate, lung, kidney and thyroid cancer (Mundy, 2002). Introduction of effective systemic treatment in many cancers has prolonged patients' survival, including those with bone metastases. Bone metastases may significantly reduce quality of life due to related symptoms and possible complications, such as pain and neurologic compromise. The most serious complications of bone metastases are skeletal-related events (SRE), defined as pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, pain, or other symptoms requiring an urgent intervention such as surgery or radiotherapy. In turn, growing access to modern diagnostic tools allows early detection of asymptomatic bone metastases that could be successfully managed with local treatment avoiding development of SRE. The treatment for bone metastases should focus on relieving existing symptoms and preventing new ones. Radiotherapy is the standard of care for patients with symptomatic bone metastases, providing durable pain relief with minimal toxicity and reasonable cost-effectiveness. Historically, the dose was prescribed in one to five fractions and delivered using simple planning techniques. While 3D-conformal radiotherapy is still widely used for treating bone metastases, introduction of highlyconformal radiotherapy techniques such as stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) have opened new therapeutic possibilities that should be considered in selected patients with bone metastases.""","""['Joanne van der Velden', 'Jonas Willmann', 'Mateusz Spałek', 'Eva Oldenburger', 'Stephanie Brown', 'Joanna Kazmierska', 'Nicolaus Andratschke', 'Johan Menten', 'Yvette van der Linden', 'Peter Hoskin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['ESTRO ACROP guidelines for external beam radiotherapy of patients with complicated bone metastases.', 'Radiotherapy of bone metastases in France: A descriptive monocentric retrospective study.', 'The cost of treatment of skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases from lung cancer.', 'Role of palliative and symptomatic radiotherapy in bone metastasis.', 'Radiotherapy for palliation of symptoms in incurable cancer.', 'The Role of Post-Operative Radiotherapy for Non-Spine Bone Metastases (NSBMs).', 'Radiotherapy concepts for spinal metastases-results from an online survey among radiation oncologists of the German Society for Radiation Oncology.', 'Factors affecting local control of bone metastases from radioresistant tumors treated with palliative external beam radiotherapy.', 'Percent of remaining life on palliative radiation treatment: solely a function of fractionation?', 'Nomograms for Predicting the Risk and Prognosis of Liver Metastases in Pancreatic Cancer: A Population-Based Analysis.']"""

Methods:   One-hundred thirty-five ( n = 135) patients who underwent Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT due to BCR were included in the study. Predictors of metastasis in Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT were determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis. Coefficients derived from the regression model were used to develop a prediction nomogram. The performance of the prediction model was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Internal validation was performed with 50 bootstrap resamples, and the nomogram's clinical benefit was assessed with decision curve analysis.  Results:   Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that ISUP group, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) before PET and PSA doubling time were independent predictors of metastasis in Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT. A prediction nomogram was developed according to this model [the area under curve: 0.866; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.788-0.944]. The best cutoff value of the nomogram-derived likelihood for predicting metastasis was 60%, with a bootstrap-corrected accuracy of 78.8%. An online version of the nomogram was implemented on pro-gram.nzm.co ( https://pro-gram.nzm.co ).  Conclusion:   The proposed nomogram provides a practical approach for predicting the likelihood of imaging-based metastasis according to Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT in patients with BCR, with results ≥60% being the most accurate cutoff for referring patients to Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT. If validated in a larger cohort, this tool can serve as a guide for the appropriate use of Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT.""","""['Nazim Coskun', 'M Oguz Kartal', 'A Sinem Erdogan', 'Elif Ozdemir']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucl Med Commun""","""['Prediction nomogram for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in different clinical settings of PSA failure after radical treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Multicenter External Validation of a Nomogram for Predicting Positive Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen/Positron Emission Tomography Scan in Patients with Prostate Cancer Recurrence.', 'Predictive accuracy and clinical benefit of a nomogram aimed to predict 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT positivity in patients with prostate cancer recurrence and PSA\u2009<\u20091\xa0ng/ml external validation on a single institution database.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Sensitivity, Specificity, and Predictors of Positive 68Ga-Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

Results:   Of 5280 patients, 1876 (36%) versus 3200 (60%) underwent RARC versus ORC. RARC increased from 32% to 41% (estimated annual percentage change [EAPC]: + 8.6%; p = 0.02).

Moreover, median length of stay (LOS) was shorter in RARC (6 vs. 7days; p < 0.001). Conversely, median THC (31,486 vs. 27,162$; p < 0.001) were higher in RARC. Multivariable logistic regression-derived odds ratios addressing transfusion (0.49), intraoperative (0.53), wound (0.68), and pulmonary (0.71) complications favored RARC (all p < 0.01). In multivariable Poisson and linear regression models, RARC was associated with shorter LOS (Rate ratio:0.86; p < 0.001), yet higher THC (Coef.:5,859$; p < 0.001).

Material and methods:   A closed cohort was created of all males ≥18 years of age living in the Northern Sweden in 1986. In total 826,400 individuals were enrolled including 40,874 hunters. A nested case-control design was used with five controls randomly selected for each cancer case matched on year of diagnosis and year of birth. Individual absorbed colon dose was calculated 1986 to 2015. Allowing for a 5-year latency period Hazard Ratios (HR) per mGy with 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) were calculated in a conditional logistic regression adjusted by rural/non-rural living, length of education and pre-Chernobyl cancer incidence 1980 to 1985. A total of 127,109 cancer cases occurred from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 2015.

Our previous study has shown that low-dose Cr(VI) exposure could promote prostate cancer(PCa) cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we furthermore found that low-dose Cr(VI) exposure could induce DNA demethylation in PCa cells. Based on our transcriptome sequencing data and DNA methylation database, we further identified MAGEB2 as a potential effector target that contributed to tumor-promoting effect of low-dose Cr(VI) exposure in PCa. In addition, we demonstrated that MAGEB2 was upregulated in PCa and its knockdown restrained PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Co-IP and point mutation experiments confirmed that MAGEB2 could bind to the NH2-terminal NTD domain of AR through the F-box in the MAGE homology domain, and then activated AR through up-regulating its downstream targets PSA and NX3.1. Together, low-dose Cr(VI) exposure can induce DNA demethylation in prostate cancer cells, and promote cell proliferation via activating MAGEB2-AR signaling pathway. Thus, inhibition of MAGEB2-AR signaling is a novel and promising strategy to reverse low-dose Cr(VI) exposure-induced prostate tumor progression, also as effective adjuvant therapy for AR signaling-dependent PCa.""","""['Yunkai Qie', 'Diansheng Zhou', 'Zhouliang Wu', 'Shenglai Liu', 'Chong Shen', 'Hailong Hu', 'Changwen Zhang', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ecotoxicol Environ Saf""","""['Chromium(VI) promotes cell migration through targeting epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'Epithelial-mesenchymal transition during oncogenic transformation induced by hexavalent chromium involves reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism in lung epithelial cells.', 'Chronic Hexavalent Chromium Exposure Induces Cancer Stem Cell-Like Property and Tumorigenesis by Increasing c-Myc Expression.', 'Complexities of chromium carcinogenesis: role of cellular response, repair and recovery mechanisms.', 'Assessment of the mode of action for hexavalent chromium-induced lung cancer following inhalation exposures.', 'MicroRNA-Gene Interactions Impacted by Toxic Metal(oid)s during EMT and Carcinogenesis.', 'ZNF276 promotes the malignant phenotype of breast carcinoma by activating the CYP1B1-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway.']"""

Immunohistochemical stains are used to determine the most likely source of metastatic deposits when they are seen within surgical specimens. The aim of this case report is to illustrate how such techniques were used to identify unexpected prostatic metastases within the pericolic fat of a sigmoid colon resection specimen following elective curative surgery for colorectal cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first report of complete excision of oligometastatic deposits of prostate cancer found incidentally within the specimen of another cancer.  Case report:   An 89-year-old Caucasian man underwent sigmoid colectomy for an obstructing colorectal cancer in the sigmoid colon with some mesenteric lymphadenopathy. He had previously received radical radiotherapy for prostate cancer 10 years earlier. When the specimen was examined by the histopathologist, it was noted that the pericolic fat adjacent to the colorectal adenocarcinoma contained some metastatic deposits. Positive immunohistochemical staining for prostate-specific antigen and prostate-specific acid phosphatase with negative staining for CDX2 and CK20 revealed these to be prostatic metastases rather than colonic. Since these were completely excised, and there were no other metastases, this represented a serendipitous, curative excision of oligometastatic deposits of an additional cancer to the one that was being treated.

This work examined (1) metastasis-free survival (MFS) after PSMA-PET guided sRT and (2) the metastatic patterns on PSMA-PET images after sRT.  Methods and materials:   This retrospective, multicenter (9 centers, 5 countries) study included patients referred for PSMA-PET due to recurrent/persistent disease after prostatectomy. Patients with distant metastases (DM) on PSMA-PET before sRT were excluded. Cox regression was performed to assess the effect of clinical parameters on MFS. The distribution of PSMA-PET detected DM after sRT and their respective risk factors were analyzed.  Results:   All (n = 815) patients received intensity modulated RT to the prostatic fossa. In the case of PET-positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLN-PET) (n = 275, 34%), pelvic lymphatics had been irradiated. Androgen deprivation therapy had been given in 251 (31%) patients. The median follow-up after sRT was 36 months. The 2-/4-year MFS after sRT were 93%/81%. In multivariate analysis, the presence of PLN-PET was a strong predictor for MFS (hazard ratio, 2.39; P < .001). After sRT, DM were detected by PSMA-PET in 128/198 (65%) patients, and 2 metastatic patterns were observed: 43% had DM in sub-diaphragmatic para-aortic LNs (abdominal-lymphatic), 45% in bones, 9% in supra-diaphragmatic LNs, and 6% in visceral organs (distant). Two distinct signatures with risk factors for each pattern were identified.  Conclusions:   MFS in our study is lower compared with previous studies, obviously due to the higher detection rate of DM in PSMA-PET after sRT.

The ability to delineate the prostate from surrounding tissue during TRUS-guided prostate brachytherapy is vital for treatment planning, and consequently, so is the contrast resolution. This study describes the development of task-specific contrast-detail phantoms with clinically relevant contrast and spherical target sizes for contrast-detail performance evaluation of TRUS systems used in the brachytherapy procedure. The procedure for objective assessment of the contrast detectability of the TRUS systems is also described; a program was developed in MATLAB (R2017a, The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) to quantitatively analyze image quality in terms of the lesion signal-to-noise ratio (LSNR) and validated with representative control test images. The LSNR of the Hitachi EUB-7500A (2013, Hitachi, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) TRUS system was measured on sagittal and transverse TRUS images of the contrast-detail phantoms described in this work. Results revealed the efficacy of the device as an image quality evaluation tool and the impact of the size, depth and relative contrast of the targets to the surrounding tissue on the contrast detectability of a TRUS system for both transducer arrays. The MATLAB program objectively measured the contrast detectability of the TRUS system and has the potential to determine optimized imaging parameters that could be designed as part of standardization of the imaging protocol used in TRUS-guided prostate brachytherapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Andrea Jane Doyle', 'Dervil Cody', 'Silvin Knight', 'Deirdre M King', 'Francis J Sullivan', 'Jacinta E Browne']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ultrasound Med Biol""","""['Prostate CT segmentation method based on nonrigid registration in ultrasound-guided CT-based HDR prostate brachytherapy.', 'A dual modality phantom for cone beam CT and ultrasound image fusion in prostate implant.', 'Robot-assisted 3D-TRUS guided prostate brachytherapy: system integration and validation.', 'Clinical evaluation of an MRI-to-ultrasound deformable image registration algorithm for prostate brachytherapy.', 'A review of the recommendations governing quality assurance of ultrasound systems used for guidance in prostate brachytherapy.']"""

Recently, strategies targeting the mitosis error correction mechanism including chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) were reported to reverse the resistance to microtubule-targeting anticancer agents. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence indicated the important roles of circRNAs in DTX resistance of prostate cancer (PCa). However, whether circRNAs could regulate DTX chemosensitivity by affecting the mitosis error correction mechanism remains unclear.  Methods:   Expression patterns of circ_0004087 and BUB1 were determined through mining the public circRNA datasets and performing western blot and qRT-PCR assays. Agarose gel electrophoresis, Sanger sequencing, and RNase R treatment were conducted to examine the circular characteristics of circ_0004087. CircRNA pull-down, mass spectrometry analysis, Co-IP, and dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to uncover the interaction among circ_0004087, SND1, and MYB. The effects of circ_0004087 and BUB1 on docetaxel-based chemotherapy were explored by flow cytometry and in vivo drug studies upon xenografted tumor model.  Results:   In the present study, we revealed the profound interaction between a novel circRNA, circ_0004087, and the mitosis error correction mechanism. Mechanistically, circ_0004087 binding with transcriptional coactivator SND1 could stimulate the transactivation of MYB and enhance the expression of downstream target BUB1. In turn, elevated BUB1 expression further recruited CPC to centromeres and guaranteed the error-free mitosis of PCa cells. Biologically, the overexpression of circ_0004087 conferred while the knockdown impaired DTX resistance in PCa cells.  Conclusions:   Our study uncovered the crucial role of circ_0004087/SND1/MYB/BUB1 axis in modulating the error mitosis correction mechanism and DTX chemoresistance, suggesting that circ_0004087 may serve as a valuable prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target in DTX-resistant PCa patients.""","""['Liang Chen#', 'Yarong Song#', 'Teng Hou#', 'Xuexiang Li', 'Lulin Cheng', 'Yunxue Li', 'Yifei Xing']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Exosomal Circ-XIAP Promotes Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Regulating miR-1182/TPD52 Axis.', 'Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'Circ_0003998 Regulates the Progression and Docetaxel Sensitivity of DTX-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by the miR-136-5p/CORO1C Axis.', 'Downregulation of circular RNA hsa_circ_0000735 boosts prostate cancer sensitivity to docetaxel via sponging miR-7.', 'MiR-129-5p promotes docetaxel resistance in prostate cancer by down-regulating CAMK2N1 expression.', 'Targeting XPO6 inhibits prostate cancer progression and enhances the suppressive efficacy of docetaxel.', 'Epigenetically silenced lncRNA SNAI3-AS1 promotes ferroptosis in glioma via perturbing the m6A-dependent recognition of Nrf2 mRNA mediated by SND1.', 'Circular RNA METTL9 contributes to neuroinflammation following traumatic brain injury by complexing with astrocytic SND1.']"""

Objective:   To find rare germline variants that predict time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical treatment in men with PrCa and understand the genetic factors associated with such progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   Whole-genome sequencing data from blood DNA were analysed for 850 PrCa patients with radical treatment from the Pan Prostate Cancer Group (PPCG) consortium from the UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, and France. Findings were validated using 383 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   A total of 15,822 rare (MAF <1%) predicted-deleterious coding germline mutations were identified. Optimal multifactor and univariate Cox regression models were built to predict time to BCR after radical treatment, using germline variants grouped by functionally annotated gene sets. Models were tested for robustness using bootstrap resampling.  Results and limitations:   Optimal Cox regression multifactor models showed that rare predicted-deleterious germline variants in ""Hallmark"" gene sets were consistently associated with altered time to BCR. Three gene sets had a statistically significant association with risk-elevated outcome when modelling all samples: PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Inflammatory response, and KRAS signalling (up). PI3K/AKT/mTOR and KRAS signalling (up) were also associated among patients with higher-grade cancer, as were Pancreas-beta cells, TNFA signalling via NKFB, and Hypoxia, the latter of which was validated in the independent TCGA dataset.  Conclusions:   We demonstrate for the first time that rare deleterious coding germline variants robustly associate with time to BCR after radical treatment, including cohort-independent validation. Our findings suggest that germline testing at diagnosis could aid clinical decisions by stratifying patients for differential clinical management.

Thus, we established a cellular senescence-related gene prognostic index (CSGPI) to predict metastasis and radioresistance in PCa.  Methods:   We used Lasso and Cox regression analysis to establish the CSGPI. Clinical correlation, external validation, functional enrichment analysis, drug and cell line analysis, and tumor immune environment analysis were conducted. All analyses were conducted with R version 3.6.3 and its suitable packages.  Results:   We used ALCAM and ALDH2 to establish the CSGPI risk score. High-risk patients experienced a higher risk of metastasis than their counterparts (HR: 10.37, 95% CI 4.50-23.93, p < 0.001), consistent with the results in the TCGA database (HR: 1.60, 95% CI 1.03-2.47, p = 0.038). Furthermore, CSGPI had high diagnostic accuracy distinguishing radioresistance from no radioresistance (AUC: 0.938, 95% CI 0.834-1.000). GSEA showed that high-risk patients were highly associated with apoptosis, cell cycle, ribosome, base excision repair, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and mismatch repair. For immune checkpoint analysis, we found that PDCD1LG2 and CD226 were expressed at significantly higher levels in patients with metastasis than in those without metastasis. In addition, higher expression of CD226 significantly increased the risk of metastasis (HR: 3.65, 95% CI 1.58-8.42, p = 0.006). We observed that AZD7762, PHA-793887, PI-103, and SNX-2112 might be sensitive to ALDH2 and ALCAM, and PC3 could be the potential cell line used to investigate the interaction among ALDH2, ALCAM, and the above drugs.  Conclusions:   We found that CSGPI might serve as an effective biomarker predicting metastasis probability and radioresistance for PCa and proposed that immune evasion was involved in the process of PCa metastasis.""","""['Dechao Feng', 'Dengxiong Li', 'Xu Shi', 'Qiao Xiong', 'Facai Zhang', 'Qiang Wei', 'Lu Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['A cellular senescence-related gene prognostic index for biochemical recurrence and drug resistance in patients with prostate cancer.', 'An autophagy-related gene prognostic index predicting biochemical recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance for prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 2 Represents a Potential Biomarker of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'A Gene Prognostic Index Associated With Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Predicting Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Chemoresistance for Prostate Cancer.', 'The role of activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) in cancer progression, invasion, metastasis and recurrence: A novel cancer stem cell marker and tumor-specific prognostic marker.', 'A pan-cancer analysis of the oncogenic and immunological roles of apolipoprotein F (APOF) in human cancer.', 'Establishment of cancer-associated fibroblasts-related subtypes and prognostic index for prostate cancer through single-cell and bulk RNA transcriptome.', 'Membrane tension-mediated stiff and soft tumor subtypes closely associated with prognosis for prostate cancer patients.', 'Indocyanine green fluorescence is an innovative and practical intra-operative identification tool: latest updates from the 38th annual European association of urology congress (EAU2023).', 'Identification of endothelial-related molecular subtypes for bladder cancer patients.']"""

Methods:   Cox proportional hazards regression model was applied to assess the association between BMI trajectory and NSCLC risk in a cohort of 138,110 participants from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. One-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was further used to access the causality between BMI trajectories and NSCLC risk. Additionally, polygenic risk score (PRS) and genome-wide interaction analysis (GWIA) were used to evaluate the multiplicative interaction between BMI trajectories and genetic variants in NSCLC risk.  Results:   Compared with individuals maintaining a stable normal BMI (n = 47,982, 34.74%), BMI trajectories from normal to overweight (n = 64,498, 46.70%), from normal to obese (n = 21,259, 15.39%), and from overweight to obese (n = 4,371, 3.16%) were associated with a decreased risk of NSCLC (hazard ratio [HR] for trend = 0.78, P < 2×10-16). An MR study using BMI trajectory associated with genetic variants revealed no significant association between BMI trajectories and NSCLC risk. Further analysis of PRS showed that a higher GWAS-identified PRS (PRSGWAS) was associated with an increased risk of NSCLC, while the interaction between BMI trajectories and PRSGWAS with the NSCLC risk was not significant (PsPRS= 0.863 and PwPRS= 0.704). In GWIA analysis, four independent susceptibility loci (P < 1×10-6) were found to be associated with BMI trajectories on NSCLC risk, including rs79297227 (12q14.1, located in SLC16A7, Pinteraction = 1.01×10-7), rs2336652 (3p22.3, near CLASP2, Pinteraction = 3.92×10-7), rs16018 (19p13.2, in CACNA1A, Pinteraction = 3.92×10-7), and rs4726760 (7q34, near BRAF, Pinteraction = 9.19×10-7). Functional annotation demonstrated that these loci may be involved in the development of NSCLC by regulating cell growth, differentiation, and inflammation.  Conclusions:   Our study has shown an association between BMI trajectories, genetic factors, and NSCLC risk.

Methods:   This paper investigated the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the regression parameters of the AFT models for small sample and/or rare-event situation and addressed the problems by introducing a penalized likelihood approach. The penalized likelihood function and the corresponding score equation is derived by adding a penalty term to the existing likelihood function, which was originally proposed by Firth (Biometrika, 1993) for the exponential family models. Further, a post-hoc adjustment of intercept and scale parameters is discussed keeping them out of penalization to ensure accurate prediction of survival probability. The penalized method was illustrated for the widely used log-location-scale family models such as Weibull, Log-normal and Log-logistic distributions and compared the models and methods uisng an extensive simulation study.  Results:   The simulation study, performed separately for each of the log-location-scale models, showed that Firth's penalized likelihood succeeded to solve the problem of separation and achieve convergence, providing finite estimates of the regression coefficients, which are not often possible by the MLE. Furthermore, the proposed penalized method showed substantial improvement over MLE by providing smaller amount of bias, mean squared error (MSE), narrower confidence interval and reasonably accurate prediction of survival probabilities. The methods are illustrated using prostate cancer data with existence of separation, and results supported the simulation findings.  Conclusion:   When sample size is small (≤ 50) or event is rare (i.e., censoring proportion is high) and/or there is any evidence of separation in the data, we recommend to use Firth's penalized likelihood method for fitting AFT model.""","""['Tasneem Fatima Alam', 'M Shafiqur Rahman', 'Wasimul Bari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""[""Firth's logistic regression with rare events: accurate effect estimates and predictions?"", 'Performance of Firth-and logF-type penalized methods in risk prediction for small or sparse binary data.', 'Penalized maximum likelihood inference under the\xa0mixture cure model in sparse data.', 'Bias in Odds Ratios From Logistic Regression Methods With Sparse Data Sets.', 'A comparison of bias-adjusted generalized estimating equations for sparse binary data in small-sample longitudinal studies.', 'Relative Burden of Cancer and Noncancer Mortality Among Long-Term Survivors of Breast, Prostate, and Colorectal Cancer in the US.', 'Does high 18FFDG uptake always mean poor prognosis?

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of MITs (WVTT and PUL) compared to pharmacotherapy as initial treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe BPH.  Methods:   In this model-based economic evaluation we simulated BPH progression in men (mean age 65 years, average International Prostate Symptom Score 16.6) over their lifetime and estimated healthcare costs (from the US public payer perspective) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), discounted at 3% annually. Various clinical scenarios were evaluated given that most men undergo several lifelong therapies up to surgical intervention and potentially thereafter. As such, in the study model men could receive up to three lines of therapy: (1) initial pharmacotherapy with MIT as second-line, and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or pharmacotherapy as third-line; (2) initial MIT (WVTT or PUL) with MIT again, TURP or pharmacotherapy as second-line, and TURP as third-line. Model was populated using data from the published literature. Probabilistic analyses were performed.  Results:   Initial treatment with WVTT led to the highest QALYs (13.05) and the lowest cost ($15,461). The cumulative QALYs and lifetime costs were 12.92 QALYs and $20,280 for pharmacotherapy followed by WVTT, 12.87 QALYs and $22,424 for pharmacotherapy followed by PUL, 12.86 QALYs and $20,930 for initial treatment with PUL. In the cost-utility analysis, WVTT as initial treatment dominated all three strategies, i.e., generated more QALYs at a lower cost.

Given that ADT acts via the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, we assessed whether baseline hypothalamic resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) could predict changes in working memory and quality of life in prostate cancer patients following androgen deprivation. In a prospective observational study, 28 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT and 38 patients not receiving ADT (controls), matched in age, years of education and Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, participated in brain imaging at baseline, and N-back task and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments at baseline and at 6 months follow-up. Imaging data were processed with published routines and evaluated at a corrected threshold. ADT and control groups did not differ in N-back performance or QoL across time points. In ADT, the changes in 0-back correct response rate (follow-up-baseline) were correlated with baseline hypothalamus-precentral gyrus rsFC; the changes in 1-back correct response rate and reaction time were each correlated with hypothalamus-middle frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule rsFC. The changes in physical well-being subscore of QoL were correlated with baseline hypothalamus-anterior cingulate and cuneus rsFC. The hypothalamus rsFCs predicted N-back and QoL change with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93 and 0.73, respectively. Baseline hypothalamus-frontoparietal and salience network rsFC's predict inter-subject variations in the changes in working-memory and QoL following 6 months of ADT.

Although androgen deprivation therapy increases the rates of organ-confined disease and negative surgical margins, there is no significant benefit on disease recurrence. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that (Fibroblast Growth Factor/Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor) FGF/FGFR-signalling is important in supporting prostate epithelial cell survival in hostile conditions, including acute androgen deprivation. Given the recent availability of oral FGFR inhibitors, we investigated whether combination therapy could improve tumour response in the neo-adjuvant setting.  Methods:   We conducted an open label phase II study of the combination of erdafitinib (3 months) and androgen deprivation therapy (4 months) in men with localised prostate cancer with high-risk features prior to prostatectomy using a Simon's 2 stage design. The co-primary endpoints were safety and tolerability and pathological response in the prostatectomy specimen. The effect of treatment on residual tumours was explored by global transcriptional profiling with RNA-sequencing.  Results:   Nine patients were enrolled in the first stage of the trial. The treatment combination was poorly tolerated. Erdafitinib treatment was discontinued early in six patients, three of whom also required dose interruptions/reductions. Androgen deprivation therapy for 4 months was completed in all patients. The most common adverse events were hyperphosphataemia, taste disturbance, dry mouth and nail changes. No patients achieved a complete pathological response, although patients who tolerated erdafitinib for longer had smaller residual tumours, associated with reduced transcriptional signatures of epithelial cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   Although there was a possible enhanced anti-tumour effect of androgen deprivation therapy in combination with erdafitnib in treatment naïve prostate cancer, the poor tolerability in this patient population prohibits the use of this combination in this setting.""","""['Elizabeth Liow', 'Nicholas Howard', 'Chol-Hee Jung', 'Bernard Pope', 'Bethany K Campbell', 'Anne Nguyen', 'Michael Kerger', 'Jonathan B Ruddle', 'Angelyn Anton', 'Benjamin Thomas', 'Kevin Chu', 'Philip Dundee', 'Justin S Peters', 'Anthony J Costello', 'Andrew S Ryan', 'Christopher M Hovens', 'Ben Tran', 'Niall M Corcoran']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'High failure rate associated with long-term follow-up of neoadjuvant androgen deprivation followed by radical prostatectomy for stage C prostatic cancer.', 'Outcome predictors of radical prostatectomy followed by adjuvant androgen deprivation in patients with clinical high risk prostate cancer and pT3 surgical margin positive disease.', 'NEAR trial: A single-arm phase II trial of neoadjuvant apalutamide monotherapy and radical prostatectomy in intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'The role of induction androgen deprivation prior to radical prostatectomy.', 'Role of Basic Fibroblast Growth Factor in Cancer: Biological Activity, Targeted Therapies, and Prognostic Value.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblast: Role in Prostate Cancer Progression to Metastatic Disease and Therapeutic Resistance.']"""

The Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) established a quality improvement (QI) initiative in June 2014 to increase AS utilization. In this report, we analyze the rates of AS utilization over time in the state of Michigan (MUSIC) for men with favorable-risk prostate cancer and compare these to rates for other men diagnosed with favorable-risk prostate cancer in the USA outside the state of Michigan. While the variables that influence AS utilization were the same in both cohorts, we found that the AS utilization rates and the rate of increase were significantly higher in MUSIC. We conclude that the QI initiative started in MUSIC should serve as a roadmap to increasing AS use nationwide. PATIENT SUMMARY: Active surveillance (AS), which involves close monitoring with blood tests and scans, is recommended for management of favorable-risk prostate cancer to avoid or delay unnecessary treatment. Our results show that a quality improvement program in Michigan increased AS use for prostate cancer patients in the state.

ProCAID was a phase 2 trial assessing addition of the AKT1/2/3 inhibitor capivasertib to docetaxel for patients with mCRPC. We previously reported that capivasertib did not extend a composite progression-free survival primary endpoint but did significantly improve the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS). Here we present OS data after 66% of events had occurred in the intent-to-treat population (n = 150). Median OS was 25.3 mo for capivasertib plus docetaxel versus 20.3 mo for placebo plus docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-1.05; nominal p = 0.09). Receipt of subsequent life-extending treatments was balanced between the treatment arms. The OS benefit associated with capivasertib was maintained in a subset of patients previously treated with abiraterone and/or enzalutamide (median OS 25.0 vs 17.6 mo; HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.91; nominal p = 0.02) but not in abiraterone/enzalutamide-naïve patients (median OS 31.1 mo vs not reached; HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.63-3.23). We conclude that OS may be extended by addition of capivasertib to docetaxel. Exploratory analysis revealed that the OS benefit was maintained in a subset of patients previously exposed to androgen receptor-targeted agents, which should be evaluated in prospective trials. PATIENT SUMMARY: The ProCAID study examined whether adding the AKT inhibitor drug capivasertib to docetaxel chemotherapy improves outcomes for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Initial analysis of the ProCAID results suggested that capivasertib improved overall survival benefit. This follow-up analysis suggests that capivasertib addition may be particularly beneficial for patients whose cancer was previously treated with drugs that target the androgen receptor.""","""['Simon J Crabb', 'Gareth Griffiths', 'Denise Dunkley', 'Nichola Downs', 'Mary Ellis', 'Mike Radford', 'Michelle Light', 'Josh Northey', 'Amy Whitehead', 'Sam Wilding', 'Alison J Birtle', 'Vincent Khoo', 'Robert J Jones']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Path to Precision Medicine in Prostate Cancer: Learning from ""Negative"" Trials of Targeted Therapies.', 'Pan-AKT Inhibitor Capivasertib With Docetaxel and Prednisolone in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Phase II Trial (ProCAID).', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Cabazitaxel Versus Abiraterone or Enzalutamide in Older Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer in the CARD Study.', 'Androgen annihilation versus advanced androgen blockage as first line treatment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Design:   Cohort study.  Setting:   Data from the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales, UK, linked to the National Cancer Registration Database.  Participants:   Patients diagnosed with cancers of the colorectum, breast, prostate, bladder or with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma during the period 2008-2016.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Differentials in net survival between groups defined by individual wage, occupation and education compared with those obtained from corresponding area-level metrics using the English and Welsh Indices of Multiple Deprivation.  Results:   Survival was negatively associated with area-based deprivation irrespective of the type analysed, although a trend from least to most deprived was not always observed. Socioeconomic differences were present according to individually-measured socioeconomic groups although there was an absence of a consistent 'gradient' in survival. The magnitude of differentials was similar for area-based and individually-derived measures of deprivation, which was unexpected.  Conclusion:   These unique data suggest that the socioeconomic influence of 'person' is different to that of 'place' with respect to cancer outcomes. This has implications for health policy aimed at reducing inequalities.

Nine genes closely related to the diagnosis and prognosis of PCa were obtained, including four identified biomarkers by HPA, CENPF, TPX2, TK1, and CCNB1, and five novel PCa biomarkers, RRM2, UBE2C, TOP2A, BIRC5, and ZWINT. Pathway analysis indicated that PCa carcinogenesis was highly correlated with liver fibrosis pathways, ILK signaling, and NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response. Two sets of ceRNA networks, BIRC5/hsa-miR-218-5p/NEAT1 and UBE2C/hsa-miR-483-3p/NEAT1 were found to be novel biomarkers for the identification of PCa. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results verified that UBE2C, BIRC5, and NEAT1 were upregulated and hsa-miR-218-5p and hsa-miR-483-3p were downregulated in human PCa cells compared with normal prostate epithelial cells.

Prostate disorders have a multifactorial etiology, especially age and genetic factors. Currently, PCa is the second most frequent neoplasm in the male population worldwide. The fibromodulin gene encodes a small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) which acts in the collagen fibrillogenesis pathway, cell adhesion, and modulation of TGF-β signaling pathways, which has been recently associated with PCa. The present study sequenced the coding region of the FMOD in a sample of 44 PCa, 90 BPH, and 82 controls from a Brazilian population, and the results identified 6 variants: 2 missenses (p.(Tyr42Ser) and p.(Pro24Ala)); 3 synonymous (p.(His253=), p.(Asn353=), and p.(Glu79=)); and 1 intronic (c.980-114A>G). Of these, p.(Tyr42Ser), p.(Pro24Ala), and p.(Asn353=) are rare variants, and p.(Tyr42Ser) was predicted as potential pathogenic by the algorithms used here, in addition to not being observed in controls, suggesting that may be a potential biomarker for development of PCa and BPH. In conclusion, we identified for the first time, in Brazilian individuals with PCa and BPH, a potentially pathogenic variant in the analysis of FMOD gene.

SPARC is expressed during extracellular matrix remodeling and is abundant in bone marrow and high-grade prostate cancer (PCa). In PCa, SPARC induces changes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), enhancing migration and invasion and increasing the expression of EMT transcriptional factor Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1), but not Zinc finger protein SNAI1 (Snail) or Zinc finger protein SNAI2 (Slug). It is unknown whether the SPARC-induced downregulation of E-cadherin in PCa cells depends on ZEB1. Several integrins are mediators of SPARC effects in cancer cells. Because integrin signaling can induce EMT programs, we hypothesize that SPARC induces E-cadherin repression through the activation of integrins and ZEB1. Through stable knockdown and the overexpression of SPARC in PCa cells, we demonstrate that SPARC downregulates E-cadherin and increases vimentin, ZEB1, and integrin β3 expression. Knocking down SPARC in PCa cells decreases the tyrosine-925 phosphorylation of FAK and impairs focal adhesion formation. Blocking integrin αvβ3 and silencing ZEB1 revert both the SPARC-induced downregulation of E-cadherin and cell migration enhancement. We conclude that SPARC induces E-cadherin repression and enhances PCa cell migration through the integrin αvβ3/ZEB1 signaling pathway.""","""['Fernanda López-Moncada', 'María José Torres', 'Boris Lavanderos', 'Oscar Cerda', 'Enrique A Castellón', 'Héctor R Contreras']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition, enhancing migration and invasion, and is associated with high Gleason score in prostate cancer.', 'The transcription factor ZEB1 promotes an aggressive phenotype in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulatory factor SLUG (SNAI2) is a downstream target of SPARC and AKT in promoting melanoma cell invasion.', 'Role of ZEB Family Members in Proliferation, Metastasis, and Chemoresistance of Prostate Cancer Cells: Revealing Signaling Networks.', 'The Transcription Factors Zeb1 and Snail Induce Cell Malignancy and Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype in Prostate Cells, Increasing Androgen Synthesis Capacity and Therapy Resistance.', 'The role of myokines in cancer: crosstalk between skeletal muscle and tumor.', 'HnRNPAB is an independent prognostic factor in non‑small cell lung cancer and is involved in cell proliferation and metastasis.', 'Multifunctional Polymeric Micelles for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Patients’ self-esteem and stress coping styles and strategies were analyzed using a Pearson correlation analysis. A stepwise linear regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of self-esteem. The self-esteem level was positively related to the task-focused style (r = 0.228) and negatively related to the emotion-focused style (r = −0.329). The self-esteem level was significantly positively related to the strategies of active coping (r = 0.358), planning (r = 0.355), and seeking emotional support (r = 0.319) and was negatively related to self-blaming (r = −0.448) and to substance use (r = −0.301).

The moderating effect of age occurred in patients up to 65 years; it was statistically insignificant in patients older than 65 years. Replacement of the self-blame strategy and the emotion-focused style may lead to higher self-esteem of patients.

We undertook this study to analyze the ""PSMA-galectin pattern"" of the human CaP microenvironment with the overarching goal of selecting novel-molecular targets for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. We examined CaP cells and biopsy samples representing different stages of the disease and found that PSMA, Gal-1, Gal-3, and Gal-8 are the most abundantly expressed glycoproteins. In contrast, other galectins such as Gal-2, 4-7, 9-13, were uniformly expressed at lower levels across all cell lines. However, biopsy samples showed markedly higher expression of PSMA, Gal-1 and Gal-3. Independently PSA and Gleason score at diagnosis correlated with the expression of PSMA, Gal-3. Additionally, the combined index of PSMA and Gal-3 expression positively correlated with Gleason score and was a better predictor of tumor aggressiveness.

This sodium influx depolarizes the plasma membrane and reduces the driving force for calcium entry. The aberrant expression or function of TRPM4 has been reported in various diseases, including different types of cancer. TRPM4 is mainly localized in the plasma membrane, but it is also found in intracellular vesicles, which can undergo exocytosis. In this study, we show that calcium-induced exocytosis in the colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 is dependent on TRPM4. In addition, the findings from some studies of prostate cancer cell lines suggest a more general role of TRPM4 in calcium-induced exocytosis in cancer cells. Furthermore, calcium-induced exocytosis depends on TRPM4 ion conductivity. Additionally, an increase in intracellular calcium results in the delivery of TRPM4 to the plasma membrane. This process also depends on TRPM4 ion conductivity. TRPM4-dependent exocytosis and the delivery of TRPM4 to the plasma membrane are mediated by SNARE proteins. Finally, we provide evidence that calcium-induced exocytosis depends on TRPM4 ion conductivity, not within the plasma membrane, but rather in TRPM4-containing vesicles.""","""['Paulina Stokłosa', 'Sven Kappel', 'Christine Peinelt']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['TRPM4 controls insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells.', 'TRPM4 links calcium signaling to membrane potential in pancreatic acinar cells.', 'TRPM4 channel and cancer.', 'Transient receptor potential melastatin 4 channel contributes to migration of androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells.', 'TRPM4 in Cancer-A New Potential Drug Target.', 'On the modulation of TRPM channels: Current perspectives and anticancer therapeutic implications.', 'The Role οf Ion Channels in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Androgen receptor assumes a vital part in normal and malignant prostate cells regarding almost all aspects of cell metabolism, such as glucose, fat, amino acids, nucleotides, and so on.  Methods:   We used The Cancer Genome Atlas database as training set, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center cohort as validation set, and Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE70769) as test set to identify the optimal prognostic signature. We evaluated the signature in terms of biochemical progression-free survival (bPFS), ROC curve, clinicopathological features, independent prognostic indicators, tumor microenvironment, and infiltrating immune cells. Nomogram was built dependent on the results of cox regression analyses. GSEA algorithm was used to evaluate differences in metabolism. The signature's prediction of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) response was validated based on two groups of basic cytological experiments treat with ADT (GSE143408 and GSE120343) and the transcriptional information of pre-ADT/post-ADT of six local PCa patients.  Results:   We finally input four screened genes into the stepwise regression model to construct metabolism-related signature. The signature shows good prediction performance in training set, verification set, and test set. A nomogram based on the PSA, Gleason score, T staging, and the signature risk score could predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year bPFS with the high area under curve values. Based on gene-set enrichment analysis, the characteristics of four genes signature could influence some important metabolic biological processes of PCa and were serendipitously found to be significantly related to androgen response. Subsequently, two cytological experimental data sets and our local patient sequencing data set verified that the signature may be helpful to evaluate the therapeutic response of PCa to ADT.

However, prostate cancers generally fail to show significant responses to immunotherapy owing to their immunosuppressive microenvironments. To sustain progress towards more effective immunotherapy for prostate cancer, comprehensive analyses of the genetic characteristics of the immune microenvironment and novel therapeutic strategies are required.  Methods:   The transcriptome profiles of patients with prostate cancer were obtained from GEO and processed with the TIDE algorithm to predict their responses to immunotherapy. Next, the significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the responder and non-responder groups were identified and used to compute the co-expression modules by WGCNA. Then, co-expression networks were constructed and survival analysis was applied to hub genes. Finally, drug candidates to alleviate immunosuppression were filtered in prostate cancer using GSEA based on hub genes.  Results:   In total, we identified 2758 significant DEGs and constructed 16 co-expression modules, seven of which were significantly correlated with the immune response score. In total, 133 hub genes were identified, of which 13 were significantly associated with prostate cancer prognosis. Co-expression networks of hub genes were constructed with KMT2B at the center. Finally, six candidate drugs for prostate cancer immunotherapy were identified in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines.

However, fluctuations in specific activity might influence tracer distribution and tumor accumulation. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the potential effect of varying the administered peptide amount on 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in tumors using PET/CT in patients with primary prostate cancer (PCa). Additionally, the impact of tumor volume on this potential effect and on accumulation in reference organs was assessed. Methods: The imaging data of 362 men with primary PCa who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were retrospectively included. Scans were quantified for normal tissue and primary tumors. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on their tumor volume. Correlation and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed. Results: The median index lesion volume was 9.50 cm3 (range, 0.064-174 cm3). Groups were based on quartiles of prostatic lesion volume: ≤4.11 cm3 (group 1), 4.11-20.6 cm3 (group 2), and ≥20.6 cm3 (group 3). No correlation was found between administered peptide amount and tumor uptake (SUVmean or SUVpeak) for any group, except for a significant correlation for SUVmean in the first group (P = 0.008). Linear regression analysis supported these findings. Conclusion: The amount of administered peptide had no evident effect on 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in tumors, except for a significant positive correlation between administered peptide amount and tumor SUVmean for group 1.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and tumor-derived exosomes that express PD-L1 can potentially be used as biomarkers; however, currently available assays lack clinically significant sensitivity and specificity. Here, a novel peptide-based capture surface is developed to effectively isolate PD-L1-expressing CTCs and exosomes from human blood. For the effective targeting of PD-L1, this study integrates peptide engineering strategies to enhance the binding strength and specificity of a β-hairpin peptide derived from PD-1 (pPD-1). Specifically, this study examines the effect of poly(ethylene glycol) spacers, the secondary peptide structure, and modification of peptide sequences (e.g., removal of biologically redundant amino acid residues) on capture efficiency. The optimized pPD-1 configuration captures PD-L1-expressing tumor cells and tumor-derived exosomes with 1.5-fold (p = 0.016) and 1.2-fold (p = 0.037) higher efficiencies, respectively, than their whole antibody counterpart (aPD-L1). This enhanced efficiency is translated into more clinically significant detection of CTCs (1.9-fold increase; p = 0.035) and exosomes (1.5-fold increase; p = 0.047) from patients' baseline samples, demonstrating stronger correlation with patients' treatment responses. Additionally, we confirmed that the clinical accuracy of our system can be further improved by co-analyzing the two biomarkers (bimodal CTC/exosome analysis).

Regions of the tissue are assessed and graded according to the observed histological pattern. However, this is not only laborious, but also relies on the experience of the pathologist and tends to suffer from the lack of reproducibility of biopsy outcomes across pathologists. As a result, computational approaches are being sought and machine learning has been gaining momentum in the prediction of the Gleason grade group. To date, machine learning literature has addressed this problem by using features from magnetic resonance imaging images, whole slide images, tissue microarrays, gene expression data, and clinical features. However, there is a gap with regards to predicting the Gleason grade group using DNA sequences as the only input source to the machine learning models. In this work, using whole genome sequence data from South African prostate cancer patients, an application of machine learning and biological experiments were combined to understand the challenges that are associated with the prediction of the Gleason grade group. A series of machine learning binary classifiers (XGBoost, LSTM, GRU, LR, RF) were created only relying on DNA sequences input features. All the models were not able to adequately discriminate between the DNA sequences of the studied Gleason grade groups (Gleason grade group 1 and 5). However, the models were further evaluated in the prediction of tumor DNA sequences from matched-normal DNA sequences, given DNA sequences as the only input source. In this new problem, the models performed acceptably better than before with the XGBoost model achieving the highest accuracy of 74 ± 01, F1 score of 79 ± 01, recall of 99 ± 0.0, and precision of 66 ± 0.1.""","""['Mpho Mokoatle', 'Darlington Mapiye', 'Vukosi Marivate', 'Vanessa M Hayes', 'Riana Bornman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Machine learning classifiers can predict Gleason pattern 4 prostate cancer with greater accuracy than experienced radiologists.', 'Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'Radiomics Features Measured with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predict Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness.', 'Recent advances in prostate cancer pathology: Gleason grading and beyond.', 'The 2014 International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Consensus Conference on Gleason Grading of Prostatic Carcinoma: Definition of Grading Patterns and Proposal for a New Grading System.', 'Development and validation of a clinic machine-learning nomogram for the prediction of risk stratifications of prostate cancer based on functional subsets of peripheral lymphocyte.']"""

However, this issue remains obscure based on the existing sporadic evidence.  Areas covered:   We summarize the therapeutic effects of PARPi in advanced tumors with multiple HRR genetic mutations, and attempted to compare these results with those obtained for cancers with a single mutation.

Existing in vitro models often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of tumor hypoxia or involve high-cost, complex fabrication/handling techniques. Here, we designed a highly tunable microfluidic device that induces hypoxia through natural cell metabolism and oxygen diffusion barriers. We adopted a cleanroom-free, micromilling-replica-molding strategy and a microfluidic liquid-pinning approach to streamline the fabrication and tumor model establishment. We also implemented a thin-film oxygen diffusion barrier design, which was optimized through COMSOL simulation, to support both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) hypoxic models. We demonstrated that liquid-pinning enables an easy, injection-based micropatterning of cancer cells of a wide range of parameters, showing the high tunability of our design. Human breast cancer and prostate cancer cells were seeded and stained after 24 h of 2-D and 3-D culture to validate the natural induction of hypoxia. We further demonstrated the feasibility of the parallel microfluidic channel design to evaluate dual therapeutic conditions in the same device.

HERVs can be transmitted vertically in a Mendelian fashion and be stably maintained in the human genome, of which they are estimated to comprise approximately 8%. HERV-K (HML1-10) transcription has been confirmed to be associated with a variety of diseases, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the poor characterization of HML-9 prevents a detailed understanding of the regulation of the expression of this family in humans and its impact on the host genome. In light of this, a precise and updated HERV-K HML-9 genomic map is urgently needed to better evaluate the role of these elements in human health.  Results:   We report a comprehensive analysis of the presence and distribution of HERV-K HML-9 elements within the human genome, with a detailed characterization of the structural and phylogenetic properties of the group.

The effect of cribriform pattern 4 (CC) and intraductal carcinoma (IDC) on such nomograms is still underexplored. We analyzed the Cancer of Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk scores in cases with and without CC/IDC to assess impact on biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastases/death of prostate cancer (event free survival-EFS) after prostatectomy. A matched biopsy- prostatectomy cohort (2010-2017) was reviewed for CC/IDC. CAPRA and NCCN scores were calculated. CAPRA score 0-2 were deemed ""low"", 3-5 ""intermediate"" and 6-10 ""high"". NCCN scores 1-2 ""very low/low"", 3 ""favorable intermediate"", 4 ""unfavorable intermediate"", 5-6 ""high/very high"". Cases were stratified by presence of CC/IDC. BCR and EFS probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Prognostic performance was evaluated using log-rank tests and Harrell's concordance index. 612 patients with mean age 63.1 years were included with mean follow up of 5.3 (range 0-10.8) years. CC/IDC was noted in 159/612 (26%) biopsies. There were 101 (17%) BCR and 36 (6%) events. CAPRA discriminated three distinct risk categories for BCR (p < 0.001) while only high risk separated significantly for EFS (p < 0.001). NCCN distinguished two prognostic groups for BCR (p < 0.0001) and three for EFS (p < 0.0001). Addition of CC/IDC to CAPRA impacted scores 3-5 for BCR and scores 3-5 and 6-10 for EFS and improved the overall concordance index (BCR: 0.66 vs. 0.71; EFS: 0.74 vs. 0.80). Addition of CC/IDC to NCCN impacted scores 4 and 5-6 and also improved the concordance index for BCR (0.62 vs. 0.68). Regarding EFS, NCCN scores 4 and 5-6 demonstrated markedly different outcomes with the addition of CC/IDC. The CAPRA nomogram allows better outcome stratification than NCCN. Addition of CC/IDC status particularly improves patient stratification for CAPRA scores 3-5, 6-10, and for NCCN scores 4 and 5-6.""","""['Yanhong Yu', 'Katherine Lajkosz', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Neil Fleshner', 'Theodorus H van der Kwast', 'Michelle R Downes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Combining CAPRA-S With Tumor IDC/C Features Improves the Prognostication of Biochemical Recurrence in Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Cribriform architecture prostatic adenocarcinoma in needle biopsies is a strong independent predictor for lymph node metastases in radical prostatectomy.', 'GBX2 Methylation Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker and Improves Prediction of Biochemical Recurrence Among Patients with Prostate Cancer Negative for Intraductal Carcinoma and Cribriform Architecture.', 'Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate.', 'Incidence and Predicting Factors of Histopathological Features at Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy in the mpMRI Era: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.']"""

We conducted an a priori designed validation study using serum specimens from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0521. It was hypothesized the pretreatment inflammatory state would correlate with clinical outcomes.  Methods and materials:   Patients on RTOG 0521 had serum banked for biomarker validation. This study was designed to validate previous findings showing an association between elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP) and shorter biochemical disease free survival (bDFS). CRP levels were measured in pretreatment samples. An exploratory panel of related cytokines was also measured including: monocyte chemotactic protein-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-23, and tumor necrosis factor. The primary endpoint examined was bDFS. Additional exploratory endpoints included overall survival, distant metastases, and toxicity events attributed to RT.  Results:   Two hundred and two patients in RTOG/NRG 0521 had serum samples available. Median age was 66 years (48-83), and 90% of patients were White. There was not an association between CRP and bDFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.07 per 1 log increase in CRP; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.38; P = .60). In the exploratory, unplanned analysis, pretreatment IL-10 was significantly associated with worse bDFS (adjusted HR, 1.61 per log increase; P = .0027) and distant metastases (HR, 1.55 per log increase; P = .028). The association of IL-10 with bDFS was maintained on a multiplicity adjustment. The exploratory analyses of pretreatment levels of interferon-γ, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-13, IL-23 were negatively associated with grade 2 or higher pollakiuria (adjusted odds ratio, 0.64, 0.65, 0.71, 0.72, and 0.74, respectively, all P < .05), and IL-6 was negatively associated with grade 2 or higher erectile dysfunction (odds ratio, 0.62; P = .027).

While health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was generally maintained in the intent-to-treat population, we further analyzed patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in defined subgroups.  Methods:   ARCHES was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study. Patients with mHSPC received enzalutamide (160 mg/day) plus ADT (n = 574) or placebo plus ADT (n = 576). Questionnaires, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate, Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form, and EuroQol 5-Dimension, 5-Level (EQ-5D-5L), were completed at baseline, Week 13, and every 12 weeks until disease progression. PRO endpoints were time to first confirmed clinically meaningful deterioration (TTFCD) in HRQoL or pain. Subgroups included prognostic risk, pain/HRQoL, prior docetaxel, and local therapy (radical prostatectomy [RP] and/or radiotherapy [RT]).  Results:   There were several between-treatment differences in TTFCD for pain and functioning/HRQoL PROs. Enzalutamide plus ADT delayed TTFCD for worst pain in the prior RT group (not reached vs. 14.06 months; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.56 [95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.94]) and pain interference in low-baseline-HRQoL group (19.32 vs. 11.20 months; HR: 0.64 [0.44-0.94]) versus placebo plus ADT. In prior/no prior RP, prior RT, prior local therapy, no prior docetaxel, mild baseline pain, and low-risk subgroups, TTFCD was delayed for the EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale.

Applying a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of aggressive prostate cancer driven by deficiency of the tumor suppressors PTEN and Sprouty2 (SPRY2), we identified enhanced creatine metabolism as a central component of progressive disease. Creatine treatment was associated with enhanced cellular basal respiration in vitro and increased tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Stable isotope tracing revealed that intracellular levels of creatine in prostate cancer cells are predominantly dictated by exogenous availability rather than by de novo synthesis from arginine. Genetic silencing of creatine transporter SLC6A8 depleted intracellular creatine levels and reduced the colony-forming capacity of human prostate cancer cells. Accordingly, in vitro treatment of prostate cancer cells with cyclocreatine, a creatine analog, dramatically reduced intracellular levels of creatine and its derivatives phosphocreatine and creatinine and suppressed proliferation. Supplementation with cyclocreatine impaired cancer progression in the PTEN- and SPRY2-deficient prostate cancer GEMMs and in a xenograft liver metastasis model. Collectively, these results identify a metabolic vulnerability in prostate cancer and demonstrate a rational therapeutic strategy to exploit this vulnerability to impede tumor progression.  Significance:   Enhanced creatine uptake drives prostate cancer progression and confers a metabolic vulnerability to treatment with the creatine analog cyclocreatine.""","""['Rachana Patel#', 'Catriona A Ford#', 'Lisa Rodgers', 'Linda K Rushworth', 'Janis Fleming', 'Ernest Mui', 'Tong Zhang', 'David Watson', 'Victoria Lynch', 'Gillian Mackay', 'David Sumpton', 'Owen J Sansom', 'Johan Vande Voorde', 'Hing Y Leung']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Cyclocreatine treatment improves cognition in mice with creatine transporter deficiency.', 'Liposomal Delivery of Cyclocreatine Impairs Cancer Cell Bioenergetics Mediating Apoptosis.', 'Use of an animal model of disease for toxicology enables identification of a juvenile no observed adverse effect level for cyclocreatine in creatine transporter deficiency.', 'The two sides of creatine in cancer.', 'Treatment of X-linked creatine transporter (SLC6A8) deficiency: systematic review of the literature and three new cases.', 'DNMT3A mutation promotes leukemia development through NAM-NAD metabolic reprogramming.', 'Dual Effect of Tryptamine on Prostate Cancer Cell Growth Regulation: A Pilot Study.']"""

The consequences of this vaccination can be seen in radiology and nuclear medicine explorations with visualization of axillary lymph nodes (LNs), as observed on ultrasonography, MRI, or 18F-FDG PET/CT.We aimed to evaluate on PET/CT the incidence of vaccine-related LNs and their characteristics after COVID-19 vaccination, using several radiopharmaceuticals different from 18F-FDG.  Patients and methods:   Between February and July 2021, all consecutive patients undergoing a whole-body PET/CT for any indication using a different radiopharmaceutical from 18F-FDG were eligible for inclusion if they had received at least 1 dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The radiopharmaceutical administered and vaccine type were recorded for each patient. The incidence of positive vaccine-related axillary and supraclavicular LNs on PET/CT was our primary finding, along with the nodes characteristics. Statistical analyses were performed for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) to determine certain interaction factors that were associated with the detection of vaccine-related LNs.  Results:   Of the 226 patients in our cohort study, 120 patients underwent an 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT, 79 a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, 6 an 18F-FDOPA PET/CT, and 21 a 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT. A total of 67.3% of patients (152/226) received BNT162b2mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech), 26.5% (60/226) ChAdOx1-S (AstraZeneca), 4.9% (11/226) mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and 1.3% (3/226) Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen). The incidence of positive vaccine-related axillary and supraclavicular LNs was 42.5% (51/120 patients) on PET/CT using 18F-fluorocholine and 12.7% (10/79 patients) with 68Ga-PSMA-11. None of our patients undergoing 18F-FDOPA or 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT presented any vaccine-related lymphadenopathy. Vaccine-related LNs were statistically associated with the nature of the radiopharmaceutical (P < 10-4), with the number of vaccine doses received (P = 0.041), with a short delay between vaccination and PET/CT realization (P < 10-5), and with a higher prostate-specific antigen level for patients with PCa (P = 0.032), but not with age or vaccine type. The vaccine-related nodes appeared in 85% of the cases, in the 30 days after vaccine injection, were limited in size and uptake, and were most often limited to the axilla level 1 area.  Conclusions:   Detecting positive LNs after COVID-19 vaccination is not an exclusive 18F-FDG PET/CT pattern but is common on 18F-fluorocholine and possible on 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Confronting PET/CT findings with clinical data (such as date and site of injection) seems essential in the current pandemic context, just as it does for the radiopharmaceuticals used in PCa to avoid PET/CT misinterpretation and incorrect patient treatment.

The metastasis model presented here is established by intracardiac injection of control human prostate cancer cells and NOTCH1 downregulated cells. The cells are engineered to express both red fluorescent protein (RFP) and luciferase. In this model, whole body bioluminescence imaging, high-resolution, and quantitative fluorescence imaging are utilized for quantitative assessment of metastatic colonization and metastasis burden.

In the present work, we analyzed native PRpnp (nPRpnp) complex formation with trypsin and inosine using SAXS experiments and established its dual functionality. Results indicated a relatively compact nPRpnp:Inosine structure, whereas trypsin complex showed conformational changes/flexibility. nPRpnp also exhibited a strong anti-cancer activity toward breast cancer (MCF-7), prostate cancer (DU-145) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. MCF-7 and DU-145 were more sensitive to nPRpnp treatment as compared to HepG2. However, nPRpnp treatment showed no effect on the viability of HEK293 cells indicating that nPRpnp is specific for targeting the viability of only cancer cells. Further, acridine orange, DAPI and DNA fragmentation studies showed that cytotoxic effect of nPRpnp is mediated through induction of apoptosis as evident from the apoptosis-associated morphological changes and nuclear fragmentation observed after PRpnp treatment of cancer cells.

Methods:   DNA hairpin containing PCA3 aptamer was thiolated, conjugated to methylene blue (MB) redox probe, and immobilized on gold electrode through self-assembly to detect label-free cancer cells.  Results:   Our data have evidenced stable and sensitive sensors presenting a wide linear detection range (0-150ng/mL). In addition, monitoring PCA3 released by different types of prostate cells can provide in-depth knowledge about prostate cancer dynamics; therefore, it is a powerful platform for earlier clinical diagnostic. The released PCA3 can vary depending on the type of adopted prostate cells.  Conclusion:   PCA3 release was monitored in a group of cells for 2 h; it showed significantly higher expression in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells.

We examined the association between previous cancer and overall survival.  Methods:   This US population-based cohort study included older adults (aged ≥66 years) diagnosed with pancreas cancer between 2005 and 2015 in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate stage-specific effects of previous cancer on overall survival, adjusting for sociodemographic, treatment, and tumor characteristics.  Results:   Of 32,783 patients, 18.7% were previously diagnosed with another cancer. The most common previous cancers included prostate (29.0%), breast (18.9%), or colorectal (9.7%) cancer. More than half of previous cancers (53.9%) were diagnosed 5 or more years prior to pancreas cancer diagnosis or at an in situ or localized stage (47.8%). The proportions of patients surviving 1, 3, and 5 years after pancreas cancer were nearly identical for those with and without previous cancer. Median survival in months was as follows for those with and without previous cancer respectively: 7 versus 8 (Stage 0/I), 10 versus 10 (Stage II), 7 versus 7 (Stage III), and 3 versus 2 (Stage IV).

This study aimed to investigate whether receipt of specialized palliative care (SPC) is affected by typical female and male diagnoses (breast and prostate cancer), age, socioeconomic status (SES), comorbidities as measured by the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), or living arrangements (home vs nursing home residence). Furthermore, we wanted to investigate if receipt of SPC affects the place of death, or correlated with emergency department visits, or hospital admissions.  Methods:   All breast and prostate cancer patients who died with verified distant metastases during 2015-2019 in the Stockholm Region were included (n = 2516). We used univariable and stepwise (forward) logistic multiple regression models.  Results:   Lower age, lower CCI score, and higher SES significantly predicted receipt of palliative care 3 months before death (p = .007-p < .0001). Patients with prostate cancer, a lower CCI score, receiving palliative care services, or living in a nursing home were admitted to a hospital or visited an emergency room less often during their last month of life (p = .01 to < .0001). Patients receiving palliative care services had a low likelihood of dying in an acute care hospital (p < .001). Those who died in a hospital were younger, had a lower CCI score, and had received less palliative care or nursing home services (p = .02- < .0001).

However, robust data regarding the impact of PSMA PET/CT on patient management and treatment are lacking, and in many areas, the role of next-generation imaging has not been defined.  Objective:   To assess expert opinion on the use of PSMA-based imaging and therapy to develop interim guidance.  Design, setting, and participants:   A panel of 21 PCa experts from various disciplines received thematic topics and relevant literature. A questionnaire to assess proposed guidance statements regarding PSMA PET/CT and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA therapy was developed for completion remotely in a first e-Delphi round. A subsequent panel discussion was conducted during a 1-d meeting, which included a second Delphi round.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Panellists voted anonymously on statements using a nine-point Likert scale from 1 = strongly disagree to 9 = strongly agree. Median scores were calculated and consensus was assessed using methods proposed by the Research and Development (RAND) corporation.  Results and limitations:   Statements were developed to cover the following topics: PSMA PET/CT utility, clinical use, and choice of tracer; patient selection; and management of patients receiving [177Lu]Lu-PSMA for metastatic PCa.

Peroxiredoxin IV (Prx4) is an antioxidant with bona fide peroxidase and molecular chaperone functions. Here, we report that Prx4 is highly expressed in prostate cancer patient specimens, as well as established prostate cancer cell lines, and that its levels can be further stimulated through the activation of androgen receptor signaling. We used lentivirus-mediated shRNA knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 based KO techniques to establish Prx4-depleted prostate cancer cells, which showed delayed cell cycle progression, reduced rate of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion compared to control cells. In addition, we used proteome profiler phosphokinase arrays to identify signaling changes in Prx4-depleted cells; we found that loss of Prx4 results in insufficient phosphorylation of both Akt and its downstream kinase GSK3α/β. Moreover, we demonstrate that Prx4-depleted cells are more sensitive to ionizing radiation as they display compromised ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species and increased accumulation of DNA damage. In mouse xenograft models, we show depletion of Prx4 leads to significant suppression of tumor growth, and tumors formed by Prx4-depleted cells respond more effectively to radiation therapy. Our findings suggest that increased levels of Prx4 contribute to the malignancy and radioresistance of prostate cancer through the activation of Akt/GSK3 signaling pathways. Therefore, strategies targeting Prx4 may be utilized to potentially inhibit tumor growth and overcome radioresistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Na Ding', 'Hong Jiang', 'Pratik Thapa', 'Yanning Hao', 'Aziza Alshahrani', 'Derek Allison', 'Tadahide Izumi', 'Vivek M Rangnekar', 'Xiaoqi Liu', 'Qiou Wei']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Essential Roles of Peroxiredoxin IV in Inflammation and Cancer.', 'Peroxiredoxin 4 ameliorates amyloid beta oligomer-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting ER-stress in HT-22 hippocampal neuron cells.', 'Expression of peroxiredoxin 1 and 4 promotes human lung cancer malignancy.', 'Intracellular signaling pathways regulating radioresistance of human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Peroxiredoxins in Cancer Development.', 'Loss of Peroxiredoxin IV Protects Mice from Azoxymethane/Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Colorectal Cancer Development.', 'Critical Role of the Sulfiredoxin-Peroxiredoxin IV Axis in Urethane-Induced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'Essential Roles of Peroxiredoxin IV in Inflammation and Cancer.']"""

We built a clinical research database, using machine learning and natural learning processing, and investigated factors influencing testosterone recovery (T-recovery) in patients with localized prostate cancer (LPC) after initial androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods:   Medication and treatment-associated dates missing in structured tables were extracted from patient notes using ConceptMapper, an automated data extraction tool, standardized and curated in Sema4 clinical research database. ADT usage duration was evaluated, and T-recovery in patients with LPC was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. We assessed the prognostic value of post-ADT T-recovery with prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival and failure-free survival.  Results:   In total, 4,125 of 30,832 (13.4%) patients with prostate cancer had medication exclusively from notes with high precision and recall, F1 score ≥ 0.95. Association of dates with medication usage had a F1 score of 0.76. ADT duration estimation had higher accuracy combining information from notes to tables from electronic medical record (70% v 45%). Baseline testosterone was the strongest predictor of T-recovery in these patients. Patients with a baseline testosterone ≥ 300 ng/dL recovered in 9.79 versus 38 months for patients with baseline testosterone < 300 ng/dL (P < .0001). Shorter prostate-specific antigen progression-free interval was observed for patients with T-recovery (≥ 300 ng/dL) at 6 months after ADT cessation compared with patients without T-recovery (< 300 ng/dL; 13.7 v 25.1 months; P = .055).  Conclusion:   We augmented structured electronic medical record data with data extracted from notes and improved the accuracy of medication information for patients. ADT exposure and T-recovery in patients with LPC produced results consistent with the literature and clinical experience and illustrates the power of applying machine learning methods to enhance the quality of real-world evidence in answering clinically relevant questions.""","""['Sunny Guin', 'Tomi Jun', 'Vaibhav G Patel', 'Kristin L Ayers', 'Matthew Deitz', 'Yuqin Cai', 'Xiang Zhou', 'Che-Kai Tsao', 'William K Oh', 'Rong Chen', 'Bobby C Liaw']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Testosterone Recovery Profiles After Cessation of Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Factors associated with testosterone recovery after androgen deprivation therapy in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Testosterone Reduction of\xa0≥ 480 ng/dL Predicts Favorable Prognosis of Japanese Men With Advanced Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Phosphorylation of RKIP at S153 by Protein Kinase C (PKC) triggers a switch from inhibition of Raf to inhibition of the G protein coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), enhancing signaling by the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) that activates PKA. Here we report that PKA-phosphorylated RKIP promotes β-AR-activated PKA signaling. Using biochemical, genetic, and biophysical approaches, we show that PKA phosphorylates RKIP at S51, increasing S153 phosphorylation by PKC and thereby triggering feedback activation of PKA. The S51V mutation blocks the ability of RKIP to activate PKA in prostate cancer cells and to induce contraction in primary cardiac myocytes in response to the β-AR activator isoproterenol, illustrating the functional importance of this positive feedback circuit. As previously shown for other kinases, phosphorylation of RKIP at S51 by PKA is enhanced upon RKIP destabilization by the P74L mutation. These results suggest that PKA phosphorylation at S51 may lead to allosteric changes associated with a higher-energy RKIP state that potentiates phosphorylation of RKIP at other key sites. This allosteric regulatory mechanism may have therapeutic potential for regulating PKA signaling in disease states.""","""['Jiyoung Lee', 'Cristina Olivieri', 'Colin Ong', 'Larry R Masterson', 'Suzana Gomes', 'Bok-Soon Lee', 'Florian Schaefer', 'Kristina Lorenz', 'Gianluigi Veglia', 'Marsha Rich Rosner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Cross-regulation of VPAC(2) receptor desensitization by M(3) receptors via PKC-mediated phosphorylation of RKIP and inhibition of GRK2.', 'Raf kinase inhibitory protein function is regulated via a flexible pocket and novel phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.', 'Protein kinase C switches the Raf kinase inhibitor from Raf-1 to GRK-2.', 'Raf kinase inhibitory protein: a signal transduction modulator and metastasis suppressor.', 'The role of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in health and disease.', 'AI-designed NMR spectroscopy RF pulses for fast acquisition at high and ultra-high magnetic fields.', 'Chronic β-adrenergic stress contributes to cardiomyopathy in rodents with collagen-induced arthritis.', 'Kisspeptins and norepinephrine regulate different G-protein-coupled receptor signaling pathways.']"""

However, the expression changes of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and its mechanisms on CAR NK-92 and CRPC cells and the effect of the anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) on PD-L1 expressed on CAR NK-92 cells remain unknown.  Methods:   Human dendritic cells and CD8+ T cells were acquired from blood samples of healthy donors and cocultured with C4-2 cells. Changes in PD-L1 expression were detected by flow cytometry. Differential gene expressions were investigated by RNA sequence analysis, while the regulation of PD-L1 molecular signaling was explored using western blotting. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and the bioluminescent intensity (BLI) of green fluorescent protein-labelled C4-2 cells. CRPC growth in vivo was monitored using callipers and BLI in male NOD/SCID mice subcutaneously injected with C4-2 cells and treated intravenously with anti-PD-L1/PD-1 mAb, CAR NK-92 or cocultured CD8+ T cells.  Results:   Significantly upregulated expression of PD-L1k was observed in cocultured C4-2 and CAR NK-92 cells. In addition, upregulation of PD-L1 expression was dependent on interferon-γ in C4-2 cells, while it was dependent on direct cell-to-cell interaction via the NK group 2 member D/ phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway in CAR NK-92 cells. The anti-PD-L1 mAb directly acted on PD-L1 expressed on CAR NK-92 cells and augmented the cytotoxicity of CAR NK-92 cells against C4-2 and CRPC cells from one patient in vitro. Anti-PD-L1 mAb significantly enhanced the antitumour effect of CAR NK-92 cells against CRPC cells in vivo when compared to treatment with CAR NK-92 cells or combined with anti-PD-1 mAb in the absence or presence of cocultured CD8+ T cells.

Expression of the constitutively active AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7) has shown clinical utility as a predictive biomarker of AR-targeted therapy resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but its importance in CSPC remains understudied.  Experimental design:   We assessed different approaches to quantify AR-V7 mRNA and protein in prostate cancer cell lines, patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, publicly available cohorts, and independent institutional clinical cohorts, to identify reliable approaches for detecting AR-V7 mRNA and protein and its association with clinical outcome.  Results:   In CSPC and CRPC cohorts, AR-V7 mRNA was much less abundant when detected using reads across splice boundaries than when considering isoform-specific exonic reads. The RM7 AR-V7 antibody had increased sensitivity and specificity for AR-V7 protein detection by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in CRPC cohorts but rarely identified AR-V7 protein reactivity in CSPC cohorts, when compared with the EPR15656 AR-V7 antibody. Using multiple CRPC PDX models, we demonstrated that AR-V7 expression was exquisitely sensitive to hormonal manipulation. In CSPC institutional cohorts, AR-V7 protein quantification by either assay was associated neither with time to development of castration resistance nor with overall survival, and intense neoadjuvant androgen-deprivation therapy did not lead to significant AR-V7 mRNA or staining following treatment. Neither pre- nor posttreatment AR-V7 levels were associated with volumes of residual disease after therapy.

Different studies report a higher risk of cancer development in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the impact of less sever CKD on risk of cancer is uncertain. However, data concerning the cancer risk in Oman CKD including dialysis patients is scarce. More importantly, there is lack of information about the cancer-specific mortality in CKD and dialysis patients.  Methods:   During January 2006 to December 2019, all patients with CKD and those on regular dialysis who are admitted or follow up in Royal Hospital were included for evaluation of malignancy.  Results:   During the study, a total of 2500 patients with CKD were included, of which 25 patients were found to have different types of cancers, of which 13 were male (52%) and 12 were female (48%).Most of patients 13 (52%) were senior adult (>65 years), then 11 (44%) were adult (19:64- ys) and only one case (4%) was child (<18years.).

However, secondary resistance to enzalutamide poses a new challenge in the treatment of cancer. Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) regulates cell function through many levels and mechanisms, and also plays an important role in the biological behaviors of tumors.  Methods:   LncRNA microarrays were used to detect enzalutamide-resistant related lncRNA in Enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 (C4-2 ENZ-R) cells and corresponding parent cells. Cell Counting Kit 8, flow cytometry, and transwell assays were used to test the effect of lncRNA NONHSAT210528 on the function of PCa cells. RNA pulls down and the luciferase report gene was used to detect the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) mechanism. The culture supernatant of C4-2 and C4-2b cells was transferred to the lower chamber for transwell assay of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs).  Results:   The lncRNA microarray analysis showed that there were significant differences in the expression of many lncRNAs between the C4-2 ENZ-R and C4-2 cells. The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection showed that the expression of lncRNA NONHSAT210528 was significantly higher in the C4-2 ENZ-R cells than the C4-2 cells. The Transwell assays showed that lncRNA NONHSAT210528 overexpression increased the invasion of the C4-2 and C4-2b cells. The cell-wound scratch and the transwell assays showed that the culture supernatant of C4-2 and C4-2b cells with overexpressed lncRNA NONHSAT210528 promoted the migration and invasion of HUVECs. Furthermore, lncRNA NONHSAT210528 regulated the expression of YOD1 dependent on miR-21.  Conclusions:   Enzalutamide-resistant related lncRNA NONHSAT210528 appears to promote the proliferation and invasion of PCa cells by functioning as a ceRNA and regulating the miR-21-5p/YOD1 signal pathway.""","""['Chen Ye#', 'Yuan-Gui Chen#', 'Sheng-Fei Qin', 'Shou-Yan Tang', 'Song Li', 'Min-Feng Shi', 'Tie Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Transl Androl Urol""","""['Establishment of enzalutamide-resistant human prostate cancer cell lines and screening of lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Long Non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 Facilitates Prostate Cancer Progression by Regulating miR-15b/IGF1R Axis.', 'Enzalutamide-Induced Upregulation of PCAT6 Promotes Prostate Cancer Neuroendocrine Differentiation by Regulating miR-326/HNRNPA2B1 Axis.']"""

Prostate cancer (PC) is a malignant tumor derived from prostate epithelial cells and is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men. In recent years, the global incidence and the annual deaths number of PC showed a continuous increase, which has caused a huge disease burden on human health. In terms of the global average, the incidence and mortality of PC in China are relatively low. However, the age-standardized incidence rate of PC was 17.3/100,000 in 2019 in China, with a 95.2% rise compared to 1990, while the global growth rate of incidence rate over the same period is 13.2%. This showed that the development trend of PC in China is not optimistic. There are few precise studies on the epidemiology of PC in China. After the general analysis strategy used in the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, we elaborated on the incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and the corresponding age-standardized rate of the Chinese PC population from 1990 to 2019 according to different ages and provinces. We used joinpoint regression analysis to estimate the incidence and mortality trends. Our analysis shows that elderly people over 80 are still the main focus of incidence and death. The epidemiology and disease burden of PC of different provinces in China show obvious regional differences, and some certain provinces such as HongKong, Macao, and Zhejiang should be paid more attention.

EXTernal beam radiation to Eliminate Nominal metastatic Disease (EXTEND; NCT03599765) is a randomized phase 2 basket trial evaluating the effectiveness of LCT for oligometastatic solid tumors. We report here the prospective results of the single-arm ""lead-in"" phase intended to identify histologies most likely to accrue to histology-specific endpoints in the randomized phase.  Methods and materials:   Eligible histologies included colorectal, sarcoma, lung, head and neck, ovarian, renal, melanoma, pancreatic, prostate, cervix/uterine, breast, and hepatobiliary. Patients received LCT to all sites of active metastatic disease and primary/regional disease (as applicable) plus standard-of-care systemic therapy or observation. The primary endpoint in EXTEND was progression-free survival (PFS), and the primary endpoint of the lead-phase was histology-specific accrual feasibility. Adverse events were graded by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.  Results:   From August 2018 through January 2019, 50 patients were enrolled and 49 received definitive LCT. Prostate, breast, and kidney were the highest enrolling histologies and identified for independent accrual in the randomization phase. Most patients (73%) had 1 or 2 metastases, most often in lung or bone (79%), and received ablative radiation (62%). Median follow-up for censored patients was 38 months (range, 16-42 months). Median PFS was 13 months (95% confidence interval, 9-24), 3-year overall survival rate was 73% (95% confidence interval, 57%-83%), and local control rate was 98% (93 of 95 tumors). Two patients (4%) had Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 3 toxic effects related to LCT; no patient had grade 4 or 5 toxic effects.  Conclusions:   The prospective lead-in phase of the EXTEND basket trial demonstrated feasible accrual, encouraging PFS, and low rates of severe toxic effects at mature follow-up.

Androgen receptor signaling pathway runs through the occurrence and development of prostate cancer. Thereby, targeting androgen receptor is a crucial strategy for the treatment of prostate cancer. α-Terthienyl, which has been used as photosensitive activator and insecticide, is a natural compound rich in marigold. In the present study, we found α- terthienyl could inhibit the cell viability of four prostate cancer cell lines, especially on LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells which endogenously express androgen receptor. Then we proved that it could inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induce apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by plate clone formation assay and flow cytometry respectively. Furthermore, we found α-terthienyl could inhibit androgen receptor nuclear translocation, reduce androgen receptor expression, reduce the mRNA and protein expression of androgen receptor target genes (KLK3, TMPRSS2, PCA3) and nuclear proliferation antigen Ki67 and PCNA. In addition, it inhibited the expression and phosphorylation of Akt protein while increasing the expression of tumor suppressor p27. Besides, we constructed a mouse xenograft prostate cancer model and confirmed that α-terthienyl also inhibited the growth of prostate cancer in vivo. In conclusively, α-terthienyl played an anti-prostate cancer role by inhibiting both the expression of androgen receptor and the transduction of its signal pathway, suggesting that it is a promising natural small molecule for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Xia Gan', 'Hailing Huang', 'Jing Wen', 'Kai Liu', 'Yuting Yang', 'Xiaoning Li', 'Gang Fang', 'Yonghong Liu', 'Xueni Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Kaempferol suppresses androgen-dependent and androgen-independent prostate cancer by regulating Ki67 expression.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of androgen receptor expression induces cell death in prostate cancer cells.', '6-(3,4-Dihydro-1H-isoquinoline-2-yl)-N-(6-methoxypyridine-2-yl) nicotinamide-26 (DIMN-26) decreases cell proliferation by induction of apoptosis and downregulation of androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Molecular regulation of androgen action in prostate cancer.', 'Orphan receptors in prostate cancer.', 'A Pegylated Liposome Loaded with Raddeanin A for Prostate Cancer Therapy.']"""

A secondary goal was to also determine if there were any clinical factors associated with significant change in LUTS and EF.  Materials and methods:   Since 3/2017, all men undergoing primary PGCA were offered enrollment into an IRB-approved prospective outcomes registry. Men were given International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) surveys prior to and 6 months post treatment. Differences in IPSS and SHIM scores are described, and factors associated with clinically significant change were assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis.  Results:   A total of 100 men completed 6 month follow up. The mean IPSS for the overall cohort decreased 2.1 units (p > 0.05). The mean changes in IPSS for men with baseline mild, moderate, and severe LUTS were 0.9 (p = 0.06), -4.2 (p = 0.001), and -11.1(p = 0.001) units, respectively. The mean changes in the SHIM score for all men were - 5.1 units (p = 0.001).

We also compared the measured dose with Treatment Planning System calculated dose for AAA and the two dose reporting options of Acuros XB using Electronic Portal Imaging Device (EPID) and ArcCHECK phantom. Treatment plans of twenty patients each who have already undergone radiotherapy for cancer of lung and cancer of prostate were selected for the study. Three sets of VMAT plans were generated in Eclipse Treatment Planning System (TPS), one with AAA and two plans with Acuros-Dm and Acuros-Dw options. The Dose Volume Histograms (DVHs) were compared and analyzed for Planning Target Volume (PTV) and critical structures for all the plans. Verification plans were created for each plan and measured doses were compared with TPS calculated doses using EPID and ArcCHECK phantom for all the three algorithms. For lung plans, the mean dose to PTV in the AXB-Dw plans was higher by 1.7% and in the AXB-Dm plans by 0.66% when compared to AAA plans. For prostate plans, the mean dose to PTV in the AXB-Dw plans was higher by 3.0% and in the AXB-Dm plans by 1.6% when compared to AAA plans. There was no difference in the Conformity Index (CI) between AAA and AXB-Dm and between AAA and AXB-Dw plans for both sites. But the homogeneity worsened in AXB-Dw and AXB-Dm plans when compared to AAA plans for both sites. AXB-Dw calculated higher dose values for PTV and all the critical structures with significant differences with one or two exceptions. Point dose measurements in ArcCHECK phantom showed that AXB-Dm and AXB-Dw options showed very small deviations with measured dose distributions than AAA for both sites. Results of EPID QA also showed better pass rates for AXB-Dw and AXB-Dm than AAA for both sites when gamma analysis was done for 3%/3 mm and 2%/2 mm criteria. With reference to the results, it is always better to choose Acuros algorithm for dose calculations if it is available in the TPS. AXB-Dw plans showed very high dose values in the PTV when compared to AAA and AXB-Dm in both sites studied. Also, the volume of PTV receiving 107% dose was significantly high in AXB-Dw plans compared to AXB-Dm plans in sites involving high density bones. Considering the results of dosimetric comparison and QA measurements, it is always better to choose AXB-Dm algorithm for dose calculations for all treatment sites especially when high density bony structures and complex treatment techniques are involved.

Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   All scans were reviewed and scored by three independent experienced nuclear physicians following the proposed guideline for the interpretation of PSMA-ligand PET/CT, as described by Eiber et al. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In total, 82 patients were included for scan analyses. The primary endpoint was met: per patient, the proportions of positive scans rated by the three readers were 67%/67%, 65%/65%, and 73%/70% for 18F-PSMA-11/68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. The miPSMA expression score was higher for 18F-PSMA-11 than for 68Ga-PSMA-11 for the reference reader. Follow-up data showed identical estimated sensitivity for both the 18F-PSMA-11 and the 68Ga-PSMA-11 scan (0.92, 0.83, and 0.92 for the three readers). A fair to good agreement among readers (at patient level) was obtained, which was demonstrated by a Light's kappa value of 0.59 for both tracers.  Conclusions:   The tracer 18F-PSMA-11 is noninferior to68Ga-PSMA-11. Superiority of 18F-PSMA-11 was limited to the miPSMA expression score, given by the reference reader. Inter-rater agreement was fair to good, and equal for both radiotracers.  Patient summary:   In this study, we compared two radiotracers: 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11. We proved that 18F-PSMA-11 is not inferior to 68Ga-PSMA-11 for detecting prostate cancer and thus can be used as an alternative. Possible superiority of this tracer should be further investigated in specific subpopulations.""","""['Kathia De Man', 'Nick Van Laeken', 'Vanessa Schelfhout', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Bieke Lambert', 'Ken Kersemans', 'Sarah Piron', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Karel Decaestecker', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Louke Delrue', 'Filip De Vos', 'Piet Ost']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['18F-PSMA-11 as an Attractive 68Ga-PSMA-11 Alternative for Prostate Cancer Imaging.', 'Re: Kathia De Man, Nick Van Laeken, Vanessa Schelfhout, et al. 18F-PSMA-11 Versus 68Ga-PSMA-11 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Staging and Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Double-blind Randomised Cross-over Trial.

Methods and materials:   As part of this initiative, the VA-NROP contracted with the American Society for Radiation Oncology to commission 5 Blue Ribbon Panels for lung, prostate, rectal, breast, and head and neck cancers experts. This group worked collaboratively with the VA-NROP to develop consensus quality measures. In addition to the site-specific measures, an additional Blue Ribbon Panel comprised of the chairs and other members of the disease sites was formed to create 18 harmonized quality measures for all 5 sites (13 quality, 4 surveillance, and 1 aspirational).

Here, we describe a large multi-gram (92 g) scale synthesis of compound 2 starting from the commercially available dehydroepiandrosterone-3-acetate (DHEA, 6) via Galeterone (Gal, 1), in 8 steps with a 26% overall yield and 99.5% purity. The overall yield for the synthesis of Gal from DHEA improved from previously reported 47% to 59%. The advantages of this synthesis are as follows: (1) In the first two steps of Scheme 2, the change of solvents and reagents enabled the isolation of compounds 7 and 8 from heptane triturations, as column chromatography was eliminated in both steps. (2) In step 3 (deformylation) the catalyst required was reduced from 50% to 10% (wt/wt) of compound 8 which enable easy purification of compound 9, with modest increased yield. (3) The fourth step to produce Gal (1) was improved by using methanol, eliminating the use of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dichloromethane, solvent which may be a problem as residual solvent contaminant. (4) In the final step 8, the imidazole-ring formation, inexpensive glyoxal (40% aqueous solution) was used in the reaction instead of expensive glyoxal trimer dihydrate. The structure of the target product (2, VNPP433-3β) was established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis.

We aimed to evaluate cabozantinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with immunomodulatory properties, in combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Methods:   COSMIC-021 is an ongoing, multicentre, open-label, phase 1b study with a dose-escalation stage followed by tumour-specific expansion stages. Expansion cohort 6 in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was enrolled at 42 cancer research centres in France, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older and had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with radiographic soft tissue progression following treatment with either enzalutamide or abiraterone, or both; measurable soft tissue disease per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1; and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received oral cabozantinib 40 mg per day and intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg once every 3 weeks. Study treatment continued until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. All enrolled patients were assessed for efficacy and safety. The primary endpoint was objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 as assessed by the investigator. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03170960.  Findings:   Between April 24, 2018, and Aug 31, 2020, 132 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. At data cutoff (Feb 19, 2021), median duration of follow-up was 15·2 months (IQR 9·6-21·7). Objective response rate was 23% (95% CI 17-32; 31 of 132 patients), with three (2%) confirmed complete responses and 28 (21%) confirmed partial responses. 72 (55%) of 132 patients had grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events, with the most common being pulmonary embolism (11 [8%] patients), diarrhoea (nine [7%]), fatigue (nine [7%]), and hypertension (nine [7%]). There was one grade 5 treatment-related adverse event (dehydration). 74 (56%) of 132 patients had serious adverse events of any causality. 28 (21%) of 132 patients had treatment-related adverse events leading to discontinuation of either study drug.

PCa in rats was induced using bicalutamide (Casodex®) and testosterone, followed by (7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene). Then, testosterone was injected s.c. for 3 months.

Group I was assigned as the control (co), group II as the PCa model, group III treated with AgNPs, group IV treated with Spirulina extract, group V treated with a combination of AgNPs plus Spirulina, and group VI treated with bicalutamide. The results show that AgNPs could normalize IL-6 levels and could overcome the hormonal disturbance induced in PCa rats along the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis. Spirulina revealed a significant reduction in the level of total and free prostatic specific antigen (PSA) to the same level as bicalutamide treatment, which was the same as the control group.

Baseline or acquired resistance to ENZA have been observed, but the molecular mechanisms of resistance are poorly understood. We aimed to identify proteins involved in ENZA resistance and to find therapy-predictive serum markers. We performed comparative proteome analyses on ENZA-sensitive parental (LAPC4, DuCaP) and -resistant prostate cancer cell lines (LAPC4-ENZA, DuCaP-ENZA) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The top four most promising candidate markers were selected using bioinformatic approaches. Serum concentrations of selected markers (ALCAM, AGR2, NDRG1, IDH1) were measured in pretreatment samples of 72 ENZA-treated mCRPC patients using ELISA. In addition, ALCAM serum levels were measured in 101 Abiraterone (ABI) and 100 Docetaxel (DOC)-treated mCRPC patients' baseline samples. Results were correlated with clinical and follow-up data. The functional role of ALCAM in ENZA resistance was assessed in vitro using siRNA. Our proteome analyses revealed 731 significantly differentially abundant proteins between ENZA-sensitive and -resistant cells and our filtering methods identified four biomarker candidates. Serum analyses of these proteins revealed only ALCAM to be associated with poor patient survival. Furthermore, higher baseline ALCAM levels were associated with poor survival in ABI- but not in DOC-treated patients. In LAPC4-ENZA resistant cells, ALCAM silencing by siRNA knockdown resulted in significantly enhanced ENZA sensitivity.

However, the underlying mechanisms behind how it exerts some effect on prostate cancer, as an extra-intestinal tumor, in a contact-independent way remain elusive and deserve exploration. Antibiotic exposure, one of the various factors affecting the gut microbiota community and capable of causing gut dysbiosis, is associated with multiple disorders. This study aims to preliminarily clarify the link between gut dysbiosis and prostate cancer.  Results:   First, we discovered that perturbing the gut microbiota by consuming broad-spectrum antibiotics in water promoted the growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors in mice. Fecal microbiota transplantation could transmit the effect of antibiotic exposure on tumor growth. Then, 16S rRNA sequencing for mouse feces indicated that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was significantly higher after antibiotic exposure. Meanwhile, intratumoral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) profoundly increased under the elevation of gut permeability. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis activated by intratumoral LPS facilitated prostate cancer proliferation and docetaxel chemoresistance. Finally, 16S rRNA sequencing of patients' fecal samples revealed that Proteobacteria was enriched in patients with metastatic prostate cancer and was positively correlated with plasma IL6 level, regional lymph node metastasis status, and distant metastasis status. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria had better performance than the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level in predicting the probability of distant metastasis in prostate cancer (area under the ROC curve, 0.860; p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Collectively, this research demonstrated that gut dysbiosis, characterized by the enrichment of Proteobacteria due to antibiotic exposure, resulted in the elevation of gut permeability and intratumoral LPS, promoting the development of prostate cancer via the NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis in mice. Considering findings from human patients, Proteobacteria might act as an intestinal biomarker for progressive prostate cancer.

However, a relative shortage of genetic counselors necessitates alternate strategies for delivery of pre-test education for germline testing. This study, funded by the Prostate Cancer Foundation, seeks to address the need for novel methods of delivery of pre-test germline education beyond traditional germline counseling to facilitate informed patient decision-making for germline testing.  Methods:   This is a two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a target enrollment of 173 participants with prostate cancer per study arm (total anticipated n = 346). Patients who meet criteria for germline testing based on tumor features, family history or Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry are being recruited from 5 US sites including academic, private practice and Veterans healthcare settings. Consenting participants are randomized to the interactive pretest webtool or germline counseling with assessment of key patient-reported outcomes involved in informed decision-making for germline testing.  Results:   Participants complete surveys at baseline, after pretest education/counseling, and following disclosure of germline results. The primary outcome of the study is decisional conflict for germline testing. Secondary outcomes include genetic knowledge, satisfaction, uptake of germline testing, and understanding of results.  Conclusion:   Our hypothesis is that the web-based genetic education tool is non-inferior to traditional genetic counseling regarding key patient-reported outcomes involved in informed decision-making for germline testing. If proven, the results would support deploying the webtool across various practice settings to facilitate pre-test genetic education for individuals with prostate cancer and developing collaborative care strategies with genetic counseling.

Moreover, the compound also affects endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ homeostasis, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We found that ML-9 provokes a rapid mobilization of Ca2+ from ER independently of IP3Rs or TMBIM6/Bax Inhibitor-1, two ER Ca2+-leak channels. Moreover, in unidirectional 45Ca2+ fluxes in permeabilized cells, ML-9 was able to reduce ER Ca2+-store content. Although the ER Ca2+ store content was decreased, ML-9 did not directly inhibit SERCA's ATPase activity in vitro using microsomal preparations. Consistent with its chemical properties as a cell-permeable weak alkalinizing agent (calculated pKa of 8.04), ML-9 provoked a rapid increase in cytosolic pH preceding the Ca2+ efflux from the ER. Pre-treatment with the weak acid 3NPA blunted the ML-9-evoked increase in intracellular pH and subsequent ML-9-induced Ca2+ mobilization from the ER. This experiment underpins a causal link between ML-9's impact on the pH and Ca2+ dynamics.

Male p.C282Y homozygotes have markedly increased hepatic malignancy incidence, but risks for other cancers in male and female homozygotes are unclear.  Methods:   451,143 UK Biobank European ancestry participants (aged 40-70 years; 54.3% female) were followed (mean 11.6 years) via hospital admissions and national cancer registries. We estimated risks of any incident cancer (other than nonmelanoma and liver cancer) and common incident cancers [bladder, blood (with subanalyses of leukemia and lymphoma), bone, brain, breast, colorectal, kidney, lung, melanoma, esophageal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate and stomach] in those with p.C282Y and p.H63D genotypes, compared with participants without HFE mutations.  Results:   Male p.C282Y homozygotes (n = 2,890, 12.1% with baseline diagnosed hereditary hemochromatosis) had increased incidence of prostate cancer [6.8% vs. 5.4% without mutations; HR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07-1.63; P = 0.01; Bonferroni adjusted P = 0.17] during follow-up. In life table estimates from ages 40 to 75 years, 14.4% of male p.C282Y homozygotes are projected to develop prostate cancer (versus 10.7% without mutations, excess 3.8%; 95% CI, 1.3-6.8). No increases in risks were found for other studied cancers in male or female p.C282Y homozygotes, or in any other p.C282Y/p.H63D genotype groups of either sex.  Conclusions:   In a large community sample of male p.C282Y homozygotes, there is suggestive evidence of increased prostate cancer incidence, with no evidence of excess of other studied (nonliver) cancers.

Herein, we compare fatigue, health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and metabolic changes in men with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide and AAP.  Materials and methods:   In this single-centre, open-labelled, phase IV trial, patients with metastatic prostate cancer progressing on androgen deprivation therapy were randomly assigned to enzalutamide (160 mg daily) or AAP (1000 mg abiraterone acetate and 10 mg prednisone daily) as first-line mCRPC treatment. The primary outcome was the difference in changed fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue questionnaire). The secondary outcomes were differences in changed HRQoL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate questionnaire), body composition, weight, glucose homeostasis, lipid profile and blood pressure. All outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 12-week follow-up.  Trial registration:   clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2017-000099-27).  Results:   170 patients were randomised (1:1) to enzalutamide or AAP. The primary outcome was positive with a clinically meaningful difference in fatigue, favouring AAP (3.4 points, 95% CI 1.2; 5.6, P = 0.003). The group difference in changed HRQoL did not reach clinical significance. The most important metabolic finding was a higher increase in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) for AAP than enzalutamide (3.4 mmol/mol, 95% CI 2.1; 4.8, P = 0.001). Eight patients developed type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the AAP group and none in the enzalutamide group. No treatment-related serious adverse event was observed.

This study examined whether different single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were reliable markers of susceptibility to and prognosis of PCa in a sample of Brazilian patients.  Methods and results:   DNA samples were extracted from peripheral blood cells of 283 PCa patients and matched with samples from healthy controls. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs in four genes (BCL-2-rs2279115, CASP3-rs4647603, CASP9-rs1052571, and NKX3-1-rs11781886) were genotyped by real-time PCR using the TaqMan® probe. Odds Ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for allelic and genotypic frequencies. The association between polymorphic variants, risk of developing PCa, and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. SNPs in CASP3, CASP9, and NKX3-1 genes, either alone or in combination (BCL-2+NKX3-1 and CASP3+NKX3-1) were associated with the risk of developing PCa.

Objective:   To compare the efficacy and safety of enzalutamide monotherapy plus AS vs AS alone in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   The ENACT study was a phase 2, open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted from June 2016 to August 2020 at 66 US and Canadian sites. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had received a diagnosis of histologically proven low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer within 6 months of screening, and were undergoing AS. Patients were monitored during 1 year of treatment and up to 2 years of follow-up. Data analysis was conducted in February 2021.  Interventions:   Randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide, 160 mg, monotherapy for 1 year or continued AS, as stratified by cancer risk and follow-up biopsy type.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was time to pathological or therapeutic prostate cancer progression (pathological, ≥1 increase in primary or secondary Gleason pattern or ≥15% increased cancer-positive cores; therapeutic, earliest occurrence of primary therapy for prostate cancer). Secondary end points included incidence of a negative biopsy result, percentage of cancer-positive cores, and incidence of a secondary rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at 1 and 2 years, as well as time to PSA progression. Adverse events were monitored to assess safety.  Results:   A total of 114 patients were randomized to treatment with enzalutamide plus AS and 113 to AS alone; baseline characteristics were similar between treatment arms (mean [SD] age, 66.1 [7.8] years; 1 Asian individual [0.4%], 21 Black or African American individuals [9.3%], 1 Hispanic individual [0.4%], and 204 White individuals [89.9%]). Enzalutamide significantly reduced the risk of prostate cancer progression by 46% vs AS (hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.89; P = .02). Compared with AS, odds of a negative biopsy result were 3.5 times higher; there was a significant reduction in the percentage of cancer-positive cores and the odds of a secondary rise in serum PSA levels at 1 year with treatment with enzalutamide; no significant difference was observed at 2 years. Treatment with enzalutamide also significantly delayed PSA progression by 6 months vs AS (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53-0.97; P = .03). The most commonly reported adverse events during enzalutamide treatment were fatigue (62 [55.4%]) and gynecomastia (41 [36.6%]). Three patients in the enzalutamide arm died; none were receiving the study drug at the time of death. No deaths were considered treatment-related.  Conclusions and relevance:   The results of this randomized clinical trial suggest that enzalutamide monotherapy was well-tolerated and demonstrated a significant treatment response in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk localized prostate cancer. Enzalutamide may provide an alternative treatment option for patients undergoing AS.

CDK9 inhibition preferentially affected transcription. In contrast, depletion of OGT activity predominantly remodeled the metabolome. Using an unbiased systems biology approach (weighted gene correlation network analysis), we discovered that CDK9 inhibition alters mitochondrial activity/flux, and high OGT activity is essential to maintain mitochondrial respiration when CDK9 activity is depleted.

Lung metastasis was retrieved at various time points for DNA sequencing analysis to identify enriched sgRNAs, thus candidate genes/miRNAs. Further bioinformatics analysis and limited functional validation studies were carried out.  Results:   DU145-KO cells promoted the formation of transplanted tumors in mice and promoted the growth and metastasis of primary tumors, compared to the controls (DU145-NC cells).

Methods:   The data of RNA-seq, DNA methylation, and clinical features of PRAD patients were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to define the prognostic value of PDLIM gene expression and the association with EMT and immune cell infiltration. A tissue microarray including 134 radical prostatectomy specimens was served as validation by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining analysis.  Results:   The mRNA levels of PDLIM1/2/3/4/6/7 were significantly downregulated, while PDLIM5 was upregulated in PRAD (P < 0.05). High expression of PDLIM2 mRNA suggests poor progression free interval in PRAD patients. DNA methylation of PDLIM2 was correlated with its mRNA expression level, and that the cg22973076 methylation site in PDLIM2 was associated with shorter PFI (P < 0.05) in PRAD. Single-sample gene-set enrichment and gene functional enrichment results showed that PDLIM2 was correlated with EMT and immune processes. Spearman's test showed a significant correlation with six reported EMT signatures and several EMT signature-related genes. Tumor microenvironment analysis revealed that the PDLIM2 mRNA expression was positively correlated with the immune score, stromal score, and various tumor infiltrating immune cells. Additionally, the results showed that patients in the high-PDLIM2 mRNA expression group may be more sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Finally, IHC analysis further implicated the protein level of PDLIM2 was upregulated in PRAD and acts as a novel potential biomarker in predicting tumor progression.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that PDLIM family genes might be significantly correlated with oncogenesis and the progression of PRAD. PDLIM2 correlated with EMT and immune cell infiltration by acting as an oncogene in PRAD, which may serve as a potential prognostic biomarker for PRAD patients.""","""['Songzhe Piao', 'Lan Zheng', 'Haihong Zheng', 'Mengya Zhou', 'Qin Feng', 'Suna Zhou', 'Mang Ke', 'Haihua Yang', 'Xuequan Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol Res""","""['Immune infiltration phenotypes of prostate adenocarcinoma and their clinical implications.', 'Systematic evaluation of the prognostic and immunological role of PDLIM2 across 33 cancer types.', 'The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'PDLIM2 and Its Role in Oncogenesis--Tumor Suppressor or Oncoprote?.', 'PDLIM2: Signaling pathways and functions in cancer suppression and host immunity.', 'Correlation between hyperbilirubinemia risk and immune cell mitochondria parameters in neonates with jaundice.', 'Comprehensive Analyses and Immunophenotyping of LIM Domain Family Genes in Patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.', 'PDLIM2 is highly expressed in Breast Cancer tumour-associated macrophages and is required for M2 macrophage polarization.']"""

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based therapy is a promising immunotherapeutic strategy. Here, we aimed to design a novel CAR-natural killer (NK) cells with a clinically significant tumoricidal effect on CRPC.  Methods:   We constructed novel CAR-NK92MI cells with a CD244-based recombinant lentiviral vector. Different intracellular segments (CD244, NKG2D, or CD3ζ) were screened to identify the best candidate according to cell lysis assay and CD107a expression levels. To enhance the affinity of the CAR to the tumor antigen, we compared an antibody specific for prostate-specific membrane antigen (anti-PSMA) with PSMA-targeted polypeptide (p-PSMA), which was screened by phage display combinatorial library. Then, CAR-NK92MI cells with both a high affinity for PSMA and a strong tumoricidal capacity were generated. In addition, we verified their tumor-killing effect in vitro and in vivo. The release of cytokine by NK92MI cells was compared with that by CAR-NK92MI cells through flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, ferroptosis-related cell death was explored as a possible underlying mechanism.  Results:   Three different CAR intracellular regions CAR1 (CD244), CAR2 (CD244, NKG2D) and CAR3 (CD244, NKG2D, and CD3ζ) were constructed. CAR2 was chosen to confer a stronger tumoricidal ability on CAR-NK92MI cells. Compared with anti-PSMA, p-PSMA exhibited enhanced affinity for the tumor antigen. Thus, p-PSMA-CAR-NK92MI cells, which expressed CAR with a polypeptide-based antigen-binding region, an intracellular CD244 and a NKG2D costimulatory domain, were generated. They could selectively and successfully kill PSMA+ target cells and exhibited specific lysis rate of 73.19% for PSMA-positive C4-2 cells and 33.04% for PSMA-negative PC3 cells. Additionally, p-PSMA-CAR-NK92MI cells had significantly higher concentrations of IFN-γ, TNF-α and granzyme B than NK92MI cells. In a CRPC cancer xenograft model, p-PSMA-CAR-NK92MI cells significantly inhibited tumor growth and exerted a more consistent killing effect than NK92MI cells. Moreover, ferroptosis is a potential mechanism through which CAR-NK92MI cells attack cancer cells, and is triggered by IFN-γ.  Conclusions:   p-PSMA-CAR-NK92MI cells can effectively kill CRPCPSMA+ cells in vitro and in vivo.

The aim of the study was to examine the efficacy of co-administered cabazitaxel and salinomycin on the survival of prostate cancer cells and CSCs.  Methods and results:   CD44 + stem cells were isolated from human PC3 prostate cancer cells by using magnetic activated cell sorting. The cells were concomitantly exposed to salinomycin and cabazitaxel, and the cell survival was determined by MTT test. Apoptosis was assessed by image-based cytometer, and cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assay. The expression of target mRNA and protein were assessed by RT-qPCR and Western blot, respectively. Combination index (CI) analysis showed that simultaneous administration of salinomycin and cabazitaxel was able to exert strong synergistic effect on CD44 + subpopulation (CI = 0.33), but no synergism was observed in PC3 cells. The combination of the two agents significantly increased Bax, cytochrome c, caspase-3 and - 8 mRNA expression in CD44 + CSCs, causing apoptosis.

Design:   Nationwide, population-based cohort study using real-world data.  Setting:   The study used national health registries, including all sites in Denmark from 2011 to 2018.  Participants:   Newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from 2011 to 2018. Patients were stratified into two groups according to the preoperative imaging modality of either 18F-NaF PET or bone scintigraphy.  Main outcome measures:   The risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) as a proxy for skeletal metastases following radical prostatectomy. The secondary endpoint was overall survival.  Results:   Between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2018, 4183 high-risk patients underwent radical prostatectomy. Of these patients, 807 (19.3%) underwent 18F-NaF PET and 2161 (51.7%) underwent bone scintigraphy. The remaining 30% were examined by a different imaging method or did not undergo imaging. Using the inverse probability of treatment weighting to control potential confounding, the HR of experiencing an SRE for patients in the 18F-NaF PET group versus the bone scintigraphy group was 1.15 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.54). The 3-year survival rates were 97.4% (95% CI 96.1 to 98.7) and 97.1% (95% CI 96.4 to 97.9) for patients receiving 18F-NaF PET and bone scintigraphy, respectively.

Here, we established anticancer profile of dibutyltin (IV) carboxylate derivatives in prostate cancer (PCa) model. We determined cytotoxicity of a library of dibutyltin (IV) carboxylate derivatives and observed that dibutylstannanediyl (2Z,2'Z)-bis(4-(benzylamino)-4-oxobut-2-enoate (Ch-620; 10 μM) was minimally toxic to normal fibroblasts. Ch-620 (1-1.25 μM) inhibited proliferation of PCa and melanoma cells on short- and long-term exposures with induction of cell cycle arrest. Ch-620 treatment increased population of apoptotic cells, as assessed by flow cytometry, and activated caspase 3. Proteomics showed activation of PPARα, with repression of SMAD4 and integrin β5 (ITGB5) in Ch-620-treated PCa cells. Further analysis demonstrated that Ch-620 resulted in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, upregulation of PPARα and decreased expression of SMAD4 and ITGB5 with reduced migration of PCa cells. In vivo studies in PC3M grafted athymic nude mice showed that Ch-620 (5 μg/week; 7 weeks) treatment reduced tumor growth as opposed to untreated controls. Immunoblot analysis of tumors demonstrated upregulated p-p38 MAPK and PPARα, followed by a decline in SMAD4 and ITGB5. Immunohistochemistry reinforced these results with increased caspase 3 and p-p38 MAPK and diminished Ki67 staining in Ch-620 treated animals. Taken together, our data indicate that Ch-620 inhibited proliferation of PCa through modulation of MAPK/PPARα/SMAD4 signaling.

More recently, nuclear speckles have also been implicated in splicing and export of a subset of mRNAs, including the influenza virus M mRNA that encodes proteins required for viral entry, trafficking, and budding. However, little is known about how nuclear speckles are assembled or regulated. Here, we uncovered a role for the cellular protein kinase TAO2 as a constituent of nuclear speckles and as a factor required for the integrity of these nuclear bodies and for their functions in pre-mRNA splicing and trafficking. We found that a nuclear pool of TAO2 is localized at nuclear speckles and interacts with nuclear speckle factors involved in RNA splicing and nuclear export, including SRSF1 and Aly/Ref. Depletion of TAO2 or inhibition of its kinase activity disrupts nuclear speckle structure, decreasing the levels of several proteins involved in nuclear speckle assembly and splicing, including SC35 and SON. Consequently, splicing and nuclear export of influenza virus M mRNA were severely compromised and caused a disruption in the virus life cycle. In fact, low levels of TAO2 led to a decrease in viral protein levels and inhibited viral replication. Additionally, depletion or inhibition of TAO2 resulted in abnormal expression of a subset of mRNAs with key roles in viral replication and immunity.

There are no effective therapeutic options for this recurrent disease. The expression of truncated AR variant 7 (AR-V7) has been suggested to be one mechanism of resistance; however, its low frequency in patients with CRPC does not explain the almost universal acquisition of resistance. We noted that the ability of AR to translocate to nucleus in an enzalutamide-rich environment opens up the possibility of a posttranslational modification in AR that is refractory to enzalutamide binding. Chemical proteomics in enzalutamide-resistant CRPC cells revealed acetylation at Lys609 in the zinc finger DNA binding domain of AR (acK609-AR) that not only allowed AR translocation but also galvanized a distinct global transcription program, conferring enzalutamide insensitivity. Mechanistically, acK609-AR was recruited to the AR and ACK1/TNK2 enhancers, up-regulating their transcription. ACK1 kinase-mediated AR Y267 phosphorylation was a prerequisite for AR K609 acetylation, which spawned positive feedback loops at both the transcriptional and posttranslational level that regenerated and sustained high AR and ACK1 expression. Consistent with these findings, oral and subcutaneous treatment with ACK1 small-molecule inhibitor, (R)-9b, not only curbed AR Y267 phosphorylation and subsequent K609 acetylation but also compromised enzalutamide-resistant CRPC xenograft tumor growth in mice.

Nanoparticles are quite successful in overcoming such problems. Multifunctional nanoparticles that provide an opportunity to perform combination therapy have attracted great interest in recent years. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are popular in various biomedical applications, including magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, magnetic hyperthermia and recently in photothermal therapy, combining imaging with therapy. Here, for the enhanced killing of PCa cells that are either androgen-dependent or not, the combination of SPION based Eto delivery and mild hyperthermia triggered by laser irradiation is proposed for the first time in the literature. For the encapsulation of Eto, highly stable, small, polyacrylic acid coated SPIONs were conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Eto-BSA@PAA@SPION). Eto-BSA@PAA@SPION with 9% drug content produced better chemotherapeutic outcomes than free Eto on both androgen-dependent/castration sensitive LNCaP and androgen-independent/castration-resistant PC3 and DU145 PCa cells by enhancing drug internalization. Single and short irradiation of Eto-BSA@PAA@SPION treated cells at 808 nm improved the drug release and sensitized cells for Eto, hence, increasing the toxicity dramatically in all studied PCa cell lines. Caspase-mediated apoptosis, DNA damage, and ROS generation were detected in the treated cells, increasing with the Eto dose and laser treatment. The IC50 for Eto is reduced to 0.08 μg mL-1, 0.13 μg mL-1 and 2.8 μg mL-1 with laser/Eto-BSA@PAA@SPION for LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells, respectively. These are the lowest IC50 values seen in the literature for Eto on these cell lines so far, suggesting that the demonstrated nanoparticles and treatment approaches have great potential to treat various PCa cells at low doses of the drug under mild laser treatment conditions.""","""['K Onbasli', 'M Erkısa', 'G Demirci', 'A Muti', 'E Ulukaya', 'A Sennaroglu', 'H Yagci Acar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomater Sci""","""['Etoposide Loaded SPION-PNIPAM Nanoparticles Improve the in vitro Therapeutic Outcome on Metastatic Prostate Cancer Cells via Enhanced Apoptosis.', 'Broad spectrum antibacterial photodynamic and photothermal therapy achieved with indocyanine green loaded SPIONs under near infrared irradiation.', 'Ion-Mobility-Based Quantification of Surface-Coating-Dependent Binding of Serum Albumin to Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.', 'Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles: magnetic nanoplatforms as drug carriers.', 'Potential for Treatment of Glioblastoma: New Aspects of Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.', 'Research Progress of Nanomedicine-Based Mild Photothermal Therapy in Tumor.', 'Anticancer Nanotherapeutics in Clinical Trials: The Work behind Clinical Translation of Nanomedicine.']"""

Case report:   Here we present the case of a 67-year-old European patient who was admitted to the hospital with hematuria, dysuria, and enlarged painful testis. Ultrasonographic examination of the testis did not reveal any focal lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis showed a tumor of 62 mm diameter mainly located in the posterior part of the prostatic gland. A pathological examination from cystoscopy biopsy allowed us to set the diagnosis of high-grade invasive urothelial carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation. The patient received neoadjuvant treatment. Nonetheless, after a short period of disease stabilization, he developed progression and brain metastasis. He died 9 months after diagnosis. During the disease course, his β-human chorionic gonadotropin level was measured repeatedly and analyzed in relation to disease progression. The level of serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin corresponded with the therapy response; it was at its lowest during stabilization and the highest in the metastatic stage.  Conclusion:   Our case study provides the first report of urothelial cancer of the prostate, with a concomitant increase of β-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin level with testis enlargement. Besides its rarity, it constitutes an interesting observation of increasing β-subunit human chorionic gonadotropin concentration with concomitant disease progression.""","""['Julia Sołek#', 'Marta Kalwas#', 'Magdalena Sobczak', 'Sylwia Dębska-Szmich', 'Piotr Kupnicki', 'Dorota Jesionek-Kupnicka']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Case Rep""","""['Persistently elevated β-human chorionic gonadotropin level after vacuum-assisted uterine aspiration: a case report.', 'Case report: Urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis with trophoblastic differentiation: A rare case report and review of literature.', 'Urinary bladder transitional cell carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation.', 'Trophoblastic metaplasia in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.', 'Human chorionic gonadotropin beta-subunit synthesis by undifferentiated urothelial carcinoma with syncytiotrophoblastic differentiation.']"""

Limited health services provision across the country and shortages of skilled nurses place a significant demand on family caregivers who are often ill-equipped for the caring role, resulting in many challenges. As they are expected to provide complex care at home with little resources, information, and support, the healthcare system rarely addresses the challenging needs of these family caregivers. This study explored the challenges encountered by family caregivers of people with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted interviews using a descriptive phenomenological approach. Twelve family caregivers of prostate cancer patients were selected through a purposive sampling technique at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analysed using Colaizzi's (1978) data analysis approach.  Results:   Three main themes were identified as critical challenges: education and training needs, resources and caregiver-nurse relationship issues. Under the three main themes emerged seven sub-themes that collectively hindered the family caregiver's ability to meet the care demands. Sub-themes that emerged were; lack of preparedness towards the caring role, lack of knowledge about condition/ treatment, misconception about the condition, lack of accommodation facilities, financial constraints, poor communication, and poor staff attitude.  Conclusion:   Caregiving is associated with significant challenges that hinder the family caregiver's ability to care for the patient effectively, further diminishing the caregiver's quality of life and patient care. Therefore, healthcare professionals, especially nurses, should consider these challenges family caregivers face and take measures to obviate them through education, preparation and support.""","""['Benedicta Owoo', 'Jerry Paul Ninnoni', 'Evelyn Asamoah Ampofo', 'Abdul-Aziz Seidu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Palliat Care""","""['""I always find myself very tired and exhausted"": The physical impact of caring; a descriptive phenomenological study of the experiences of prostate cancer caregivers in Cape Coast, Ghana.', 'Psychosocial experiences of caring by family caregivers of patients living with prostate cancer in a teaching hospital: A descriptive phenomenological study.', 'Effectiveness of interventions to improve family-staff relationships in the care of people with dementia in residential aged care: a systematic review protocol.', 'Caregiver burden in relatives of persons with schizophrenia: an overview of measure instruments.', 'The emerging role and needs of family caregivers in cancer care.']"""

However, it is unknown whether this growth is mediated by patient factors. In this study, we sought to evaluate factors associated with deferred treatment in patients with low-risk prostate cancer and shifts in these factors after recent incorporation of active surveillance into national guidelines.  Materials and methods:   We identified 137,915 men diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen <10 ng/mL, Gleason score ≤6, stage cT1-cT2a) in the National Cancer Database from 2010 to 2017. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with deferred treatment. Interaction variables were added to determine whether trends in use of deferred treatment over time depend on race, income, education, and insurance status.  Results:   The use of deferred treatment among men with low-risk prostate cancer increased from 14.7% in 2010-2011 to 46.3% in 2016-2017 (P < .001). On multivariate analysis, deferred treatment was associated with older age, more contemporary year of diagnosis, black race, lower income, higher educational attainment, government insurance, being uninsured, treatment at an academic/research facility, and treatment at a facility in New England (each P < .05). Incorporation of interaction variables showed that black race, belonging to the two lowest income quartiles, government insurance, and being uninsured became less associated with deferred treatment in recent years.  Conclusions:   The use of deferred treatment among men with low-risk prostate cancer increased significantly from 2010 to 2017. However, patients who were black, low-income, and not privately insured experienced smaller increases in deferred treatment.

As controls, we chose 20 and 16 males studied with [18F]FDG for extrapelvic disease with and without CECT. Posterior anterior (PA) ratio was calculated as SUVpost/SUVant * 100 % based on maximal standard uptake values (SUV) in 20 mm spheres in the anterior and posterior bladder. Four nuclear physicians scored assessibility of the bladder base on a 3-point Likert scale (3 = optimal, 1 = poor). We acquired serial PET/CT over 4 hours of a flask with layering of 100 ml intravenous contrast agent and 100 ml physiological saline with 40 MBq of [18F]PSMA-1007, while a control flask was shaken at the start of the experiment.  Results:   Layering of tracer was observed in all PET/CT studies with CE-CT, but not in studies without contrast. Median PA ratios were 44 % (interquartile range 33-62) for [18F]PSMA-1007 and 73 % (52-67) for [18F]FDG, respectively. Intravenous contrast improved assessibility scores in PET of the bladder base, but the effect only reached significance in the PET/MR data. In the in vitro data, radioactivity was retained in the aqueous supernatant over the entire experiment whereas there was no separation of phases in the control flask over time.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered potential therapeutic agents due to their ability to control gene expression and cellular pathways. The accurate identification of genes and pathways which are targeted by a miRNA is the first step in the therapeutic use of these molecules. In this regard, there are multiple experimental and computational methods to predict and confirm the miRNA-mRNA relationships. The targeting the androgen receptor (AR) indirectly as the most important mediator of prostate cancer has been posited to both control the disease and prevent resistance to treatment. This study aimed to identify miRNAs targeting AR coregulators. For this purpose, we examined target genes by combining miRNA-mRNA computational and experimental data from various databases. miR-27a-3p and miR-124 displayed the highest scores and were selected as miRNAs with the potential to target candidate genes. Next, three cell lines of prostate cancer including PC3, LNCAP, and DU145 were transfected with plasmids which were expressed these selected miRNAs. Then, the gene expression and cell cycle analysis were performed. A decrease was observed in cell viability in all three cell lines than the cells transfected with backbone plasmid. Furthermore, the findings indicated that miR-27a-3p and miR-124 led to a significant decrease in the expression of all genes that were studied in PC3 cell line. In addition, miR-124 caused significant the cellular arrest in the G0/G1 stage, while for miR-27a-3p, this arrest occurred was in the G2/M stage.

International recommendations for localized prostate cancer (PCa) include deferred treatment and adjusted therapeutic routines.  Materials and methods:   To longitudinally evaluate changes in PCa treatment strategies in urological and radiotherapy departments in Germany, a link to a survey was sent to 134 institutions covering two representative baseline weeks prior to the pandemic and 13 weeks from March 2020 to February 2021. The questionnaire captured the numbers of radical prostatectomies, prostate biopsies and case numbers for conventional and hypofractionation radiotherapy. The results were evaluated using descriptive analyses.  Results:   A total of 35% of the questionnaires were completed. PCa therapy increased by 6% in 2020 compared to 2019. At baseline, a total of 69 radiotherapy series and 164 radical prostatectomies (RPs) were documented. The decrease to 60% during the first wave of COVID-19 particularly affected low-risk PCa. The recovery throughout the summer months was followed by a renewed reduction to 58% at the end of 2020. After a gradual decline to 61% until July 2020, the number of prostate biopsies remained stable (89% to 98%) during the second wave. The use of RP fluctuated after an initial decrease without apparent prioritization of risk groups. Conventional fractionation was used in 66% of patients, followed by moderate hypofractionation (30%) and ultrahypofractionation (4%). One limitation was a potential selection bias of the selected weeks and the low response rate.  Conclusion:   While the diagnosis and therapy of PCa were affected in both waves of the pandemic, the interim increase between the peaks led to a higher total number of patients in 2020 than in 2019. Recommendations regarding prioritization and fractionation routines were implemented heterogeneously, leaving unexplored potential for future pandemic challenges.""","""['Nina N Harke', 'Christian Wagner', 'Robert M Hermann', 'Boris A Hadaschik', 'Jan Philipp Radtke', 'Alev Altay-Langguth', 'Stefan Aufderklamm', 'Christian Bach', 'Martina Becker-Schiebe', 'Andreas Blana', 'Frank Bruns', 'Stephan Buse', 'Stephanie E Combs', 'Christina L Engels', 'Emad Ezzibdeh', 'Marcel Fiedler', 'Laura-Anna Fischer', 'Mahmoud Farzat', 'Alexander Frismann', 'Matthias M Heck', 'Christoph Henkenberens', 'Marie C Roesch', 'Christoph Käding', 'Gunther Klautke', 'Philipp Krausewitz', 'Markus A Kuczyk', 'Conrad Leitsmann', 'Sebastian Lettmaier', 'Samy Mahjoub', 'Andreas Manseck', 'Daniel Medenwald', 'Andreas Meyer', 'Oliver Micke', 'Rudolf Moritz', 'Marcel Ott', 'Inga Peters', 'Sasa Pokupic', 'Daniel Porres', 'Felix Preisser', 'Kathrin Reichel', 'Andreas Schneider', 'Christian Schwentner', 'Sergiu Scobioala', 'Michael Truss', 'Daniel Wegener', 'Felix Wezel', 'Kay Willborn', 'Jörn H Witt', 'Andrea Wittig', 'Michael Wittlinger', 'Hendrik A Wolff', 'Volker Zimmermanns', 'Hans Christiansen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Prostate needle biopsy reporting: how are the surgical members of the Society of Urologic Oncology using pathology reports to guide treatment of prostate cancer patients?', 'Prostate Cancer Diagnosis and Management During One Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Ultra-hypofractionated versus conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer (HYPO-RT-PC): patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes of a randomised, controlled, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial.', 'Forecasting the Future of Urology Practice: A Comprehensive Review of the Recommendations by International and European Associations on Priority Procedures During the COVID-19 Pandemic.', 'Ultrahypofractionation of localized prostate cancer : Statement from the DEGRO working group prostate cancer.', 'High-intensity theatre (HIT) lists to tackle the elective surgery backlog.', 'Lymphadenopathies before and during the Pandemic COVID-19: Increasing Incidence of Metastases from Solid Tumors.']"""

Upon oncogenic or inflammatory stimulation, tumor cells or immune cells express cell surface enolase-1 (ENO1) as plasminogen receptor to facilitate their migration via plasmin activation. Little is known about the roles of ENO1 in prostate cancer, especially in the tumor microenvironment (TME). We hypothesized that targeting surface ENO1 with specific mAbs would exert multifactorial therapeutic potentials against prostate cancer. In vivo, we showed ENO1 mAb (HuL227) reduced the growth of subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft, monocytes recruitment, and intratumoral angiogenesis. In a PC-3 intratibial implantation model, HuL227 reduced tumor growth and osteoclast activation in the bone. To investigate the antitumor mechanism of ENO1 mAb, we found that blocking surface ENO1 significantly reduced VEGF-A-induced tube formation of endothelial cells in vitro. Furthermore, HuL227 inhibited inflammation-enhanced osteoclasts activity and the secretion of invasion-related cytokines CCL2 and TGFβ from osteoclasts. In addition, inflammation-induced migration and chemotaxis of androgen-independent prostate cancer cells were dose-dependently inhibited by HuL227.

In this study, it is aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of Imams toward prostate cancer (PCa) in order to evaluate their contribution to the fight against PCa in one part of Turkey. This study was carried out on 287 Imams serving in Kahramanmaraş Province in Turkey. A questionnaire investigating the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on PCa was conducted. The mean age of Imams was 40.46 ± 8.93 (min = 22, max = 60). Of the participants, 266 (92.7%) said they had heard of PCa, and 16 (5.6%) had heard of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test. The majority of Imam's had poor knowledge regarding PCa. The knowledge score of Imams did not change according to marital status (p = 0.304) or education level (p = 0.16), but the knowledge score significantly increased with age groups (as age increased) (p = 0.010). Results of the present study revealed that Imams lack significant knowledge on PCa. Training on PCa should be organized for Imams, and the issuance of fatwa for PCa should be encouraged.

KMCA has been applied to the study of the endogenous lipid biochemistry of prostate cancer and prostate healthy cell models, while the corresponding SRS spectrum of the lipid droplet (LD) cluster enabled direct comparison of their composition. The application of KMCA in visualizing the LD content of prostate cell models following the inhibition of de novo lipid synthesis (DNL) using the acetyl-coA carboxylase inhibitor, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid (TOFA), is demonstrated. This method identified a reliance of prostate cancer cell models upon DNL for metabolic requirements, with a significant reduction in the cellular LD content after treatment with TOFA, which was not observed in normal prostate cell models.

This study examines decision-making factors associated with AS vs aggressive treatment in a population-based cohort of low-risk patients.  Methods:   Newly diagnosed patients (n = 599) were enrolled through the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry from 2011 to 2013 and surveyed regarding 5 factors that may impact treatment decision making: perceived cancer aggressiveness, aggressiveness of treatment intent, most important goal (eg, cure, quality of life), primary information source, and primary decision maker. We examined the association between treatment decision-making factors with patient choice for AS vs aggressive treatment using multivariable logistic regression analysis.  Results:   This is a sociodemographically diverse cohort reflective of the population-based design, with 37.6% overall (47.6% among very low-risk patients) choosing AS. Aggressive treatment intent (odds ratio [OR] = 7.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.57 to 11.01), perceived cancer aggressiveness (OR = 4.93, 95% CI = 2.71 to 8.97), most important goal (cure vs other, OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.12 to 2.63), and primary information source (personal and family vs physician, OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.10 to 2.82) were associated with aggressive treatment. Overall, 88.4% of patients (92.2% among very low-risk) who indicated an intent to treat the cancer ""not very aggressively"" chose AS.  Conclusions:   These data from the patient's perspective shed new light on potentially modifiable factors that can help further increase AS uptake among low-risk patients. Helping more low-risk patients feel comfortable with a ""not very aggressive"" treatment approach may be especially important, which can be facilitated through patient education interventions to improve the understanding of the cancer diagnosis and AS having a curative intent.""","""['Ramsankar Basak', 'Deborah S Usinger', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Xinglei Shen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JNCI Cancer Spectr""","""['Satisfaction with Care Among Men with Localised Prostate Cancer: A Nationwide Population-based Study.', 'Income level and treatment selection in prostate cancer: analysis of a North Carolina population-based cohort.', 'Selecting Active Surveillance: Decision Making Factors for Men with a Low-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.', 'Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions.']"""

We evaluated the sources of variability of lipidomic profiles measured in blood samples and the implications when designing epidemiologic studies. We measured 918 lipid species in nonfasting baseline serum from 693 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, with 570 participants having serial blood samples separated by 1-5 years and 72 blinded replicate quality control samples. Blood samples were collected during 1993-2006.

The technical variability was moderate, with a median intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.79. The combination of technical and within-individual variances accounted for most of the variability in 74% of the lipid species. For an average true relative risk of 3 (comparing upper and lower quartiles) after correction for multiple comparisons at the Bonferroni significance threshold (α = 0.05/918 = 5.45 ×10-5), we estimated that a study with 500, 1,000, and 5,000 total participants (1:1 case-control ratio) would have 19%, 57%, and 99% power, respectively.

With this objective in view, the study investigates whether the phase space model can facilitate dose calculations which are compatible with those of a commercial treatment planning system, for convenient interoperability.  Materials and methods:   A dual-source model of the head of a Versa HD accelerator (Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) was created. The model used parameters chosen to be compatible with those of 6-MV flattened and 6-MV flattening filter-free photon beams in the RayStation treatment planning system (RaySearch Laboratories, Stockholm, Sweden). The phase space model was used to calculate a photon phase space for several treatment plans, and the resulting phase space was applied to the Dose Planning Method (DPM) Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. Simple fields and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans for prostate and lung were calculated for benchmarking purposes and compared with the convolution-superposition dose calculation within RayStation.  Results:   For simple square fields in a water phantom, the calculated dose distribution agrees to within ±2% with that from the commercial treatment planning system, except in the buildup region, where the DPM code does not model the electron contamination. For IMRT plans of prostate and lung, agreements of ±2% and ±6%, respectively, are found, with slightly larger differences in the high dose gradients.  Conclusions:   The phase space model presented allows convenient calculation of a phase space for application to Monte Carlo dose calculation, with straightforward translation of beam parameters from the RayStation beam model.

Therefore, to begin addressing this research gap, this study evaluated the psychometric properties of a traditional Chinese version of the Revised Health Care System Distrust Scale and used it to assess the level of distrust in a healthcare system. The study involved a community-based personal interview survey of individuals in Hong Kong. A total of 340 men were randomly recruited. In addition to the distrust instrument, the two-item Trust in Physician Scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used. The two-factor structure of the distrust scale was confirmed. The item-total correlations corrected for overlap were >0.4 for both the Competence and Values Distrust subscales, confirming the internal construct validity of the scale. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.77 for both subscales. The scores of both the Competence and Values subscales were moderately negatively correlated with the total score of the Trust in Physician Scale, providing support for convergent validity. Regarding known-group validity, the scale could differentiate people according to marital status, monthly personal income and severity of depressive symptoms. Moreover, we found that men who had previously undergone prostate cancer screening had higher Values Distrust scores than those who had not. The descriptive analysis showed that only about half of the participants reported that they received high-quality medical care and that the healthcare system provided excellent medical care, suggesting that more effort is needed to improve the quality of care and people's satisfaction with healthcare in Hong Kong.

Objective:   To evaluate the oncological outcomes of salvage PSMA-RGS and determine the predictive preoperative factors of improved outcomes.  Design, setting, and participants:   A cohort study of oligorecurrent PCa patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after radical prostatectomy and imaging with PSMA positron emission tomography (PET), treated with PSMA-RGS in two tertiary care centers (2014-2020), was conducted.  Intervention:   PSMA-RGS.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models were used to assess BCR-free (BFS) and therapy-free (TFS) survival. Postoperative complications were classified according to Clavien-Dindo.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 364 patients without concomitant treatment were assessed. At PSMA-RGS, metastatic soft-tissue PCa lesions were removed in 343 (94%) patients. At 2-16 wk after PSMA-RGS, 165 patients reached a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <0.2 ng/ml. Within 3 mo, 24 (6.6%) patients suffered from Clavien-Dindo complications grade III-IV. At 2 yr, BFS and TFS rates were 32% and 58%, respectively. In multivariable analyses, higher preoperative PSA (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.12), higher number of PSMA-avid lesions (HR: 1.23, CI: 1.08-1.40), multiple (pelvic plus retroperitoneal) localizations (HR: 1.90, CI: 1.23-2.95), and retroperitoneal localization (HR: 2.04, CI: 1.31-3.18) of lesions in preoperative imaging were independent predictors of BCR after PSMA-RGS. The main limitation is the lack of a control group.  Conclusions:   As salvage surgery in oligorecurrent PCa currently constitutes an experimental treatment approach, careful patient selection is mandatory based on life expectancy, low PSA values, and low number of PSMA PET-avid lesions located in the pelvis.

Methods and materials:   An optimization procedure and workflow were devised for spot-scanning hadron arc therapy (SHArc) treatment planning in the PRECISE (PaRticle thErapy using single and Combined Ion optimization StratEgies) treatment planning system (TPS). Physical and biological beam models were developed for helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon ions via FLUKA MC simulation. SHArc treatments were optimized using both single-ion (12 C, 16 O, or 20 Ne) and multi-ion therapy (16 O+4 He or 20 Ne+4 He) applying variable relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling using a modified microdosimetric kinetic model (mMKM) with (α/β)x values of 2, 5, and 3.1 Gy, respectively, for glioblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma patient cases. Dose, effective dose, linear energy transfer (LET), and RBE were computed with the GPU-accelerated dose engine FRoG and dosimetric/biophysical attributes were evaluated in the context of conventional particle and photon-based therapies (e.g., volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT]).  Results:   All SHArc plans met the target optimization goals (3GyRBE) and demonstrated increased target conformity and substantially lower low-dose bath to surrounding normal tissues than VMAT. SHArc plans using a singleion species (12 C, 16 O, or 20 Ne) exhibited favorable LET distributions with the highest-LET components centralized in the target volume, with values ranging from ∼80-170 keV/μm, ∼130-220 keV/μm, and ∼180-350 keV/μm for 12 C, 16 O, or 20 Ne, respectively, exceeding mean target LET of conventional particle therapy (12 C:∼55, 16 O:∼75 20 Ne:∼95 keV/μm). Multi-ion therapy with SHArc delivery (SHArcMIT ) provided a similar level of target LET enhancement as SHArc compared to conventional planning, however, with additional benefits of homogenous physical dose and RBE distributions.  Conclusion:   Here, we demonstrate that arc delivery of light and heavy ion beams, using either a single-ion species (12 C, 16 O, or 20 Ne) or combining two ions in a single fraction (16 O+4 He or 20 Ne+4 He) affords enhanced physical and biological distributions (e.g., LET) compared with conventional delivery with photons or particle beams.

Besides deterministic normal-tissue complications, stochastic long-term effects like secondary cancer (SC) induction are of importance when comparing different treatment modalities.  Purpose:   To develop a modeling approach for comparison of SC risk in proton and carbon ion therapy.  Methods and materials:   The local effect model (LEM) is used to predict the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of SC induction after particle therapy. A key feature of the new approach is the double use of the LEM, reflecting the competition between the two processes of mutation induction (leading to cancer development) and cell inactivation (leading to suppression of cancer development). Based on previous investigations, treatment plans were in this work analyzed for an idealized geometry in order to assess the underlying systematic dependencies of cancer induction. In a further step, relative SC risks were predicted for proton and carbon ion treatment plans prepared for 10 prostate cancer patients.  Results:   We investigated the impact of factors such as treatment plan geometry, fractionation scheme, and tissue radiosensitivity to photon irradiation on the ion beam SC risk. Our model studies do not result in a clear preference for either protons or carbon ions, but rather indicate a complex interplay of different aspects. Reduced lateral scattering leads to a lower SC risk for carbon ions compared to protons at the lateral field margins in the entrance channel, while an increased risk was found closely behind the tumor due to projectile fragmentation. The fractionation scheme had little impact on the expected risk ratio. With respect to sensitivity parameters, those characterizing RBE for cell killing of potentially cancerous cells as well as of the primary tumor had the most significant impact. The observed general systematic dependencies are in agreement with results from previous model studies. The prostate patient study reveals reduced SC risks predictions for skin and bones for carbon ions as compared to protons, but higher mean risks for bladder and rectum.  Conclusion:   The methods established in this work provide a basis for further investigating treatment optimizing strategies for ion beam therapy with regard to SC risk comparisons.""","""['Antonia Hufnagl', 'Gracinda Johansson', 'Albert Siegbahn', 'Marco Durante', 'Thomas Friedrich', 'Michael Scholz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['First application of the BIANCA biophysical model to carbon-ion patient cases.', 'Assessment of potential advantages of relevant ions for particle therapy: a model based study.', 'Results of a prospective randomized trial on long-term effectiveness of protons and carbon ions in prostate cancer: LEM I and α/β\xa0=\xa02\xa0Gy overestimates the RBE.', 'A comparison of mechanism-inspired models for particle relative biological effectiveness (RBE).', 'Roadmap: helium ion therapy.']"""

Insight in cell-to-cell communication networks provides new therapeutic avenues to mold processes that contribute to PCa tumor microenvironment (TME) alterations. Here we performed a detailed characterization of PCa tumor endothelial cells (TEC) to delineate intercellular crosstalk between TEC and the PCa TME.  Methods:   TEC isolated from 67 fresh radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens underwent multi-omic ex vivo characterization as well as orthogonal validation of both TEC functions and key markers by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF). To identify cell-cell interaction targets in TEC, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in four PCa patients who underwent a RP to catalogue cellular TME composition. Targets were cross-validated using IHC, publicly available datasets, cell culture expriments as well as a PCa xenograft mouse model.  Results:   Compared to adjacent normal endothelial cells (NEC) bulk RNA-seq analysis revealed upregulation of genes associated with tumor vasculature, collagen modification and extracellular matrix remodeling in TEC. PTGIR, PLAC9, CXCL12 and VDR were identified as TEC markers and confirmed by IF and IHC in an independent patient cohort. By scRNA-seq we identified 27 cell (sub)types, including endothelial cells (EC) with arterial, venous and immature signatures, as well as angiogenic tip EC. A focused molecular analysis revealed that arterial TEC displayed highest CXCL12 mRNA expression levels when compared to all other TME cell (sub)populations and showed a negative prognostic role. Receptor-ligand interaction analysis predicted interactions between arterial TEC derived CXCL12 and its cognate receptor CXCR4 on angiogenic tip EC. CXCL12 was in vitro and in vivo validated as actionable TEC target by highlighting the vessel number- and density- reducing activity of the CXCR4-inhibitor AMD3100 in murine PCa as well as by inhibition of TEC proliferation and migration in vitro.

Methods:   We conducted a prospective study on 91 patients who were diagnosed with sigmoid colon and rectal cancers and underwent laparoscopic surgery during 2014-2016. Voiding and male and female sexual dysfunctions following surgery were evaluated by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function-5 (IIEF-5), and Female Sexual Function Index-6 (FSFI-6), respectively. Urogenital function was compared at pre-surgery and 3 and 12 months postoperatively, and factors associated with urogenital dysfunction were identified.  Results:   The overall urinary function after surgery was better when compared to that at pre-surgery; however, there was deterioration in both male and female sexual functions. The mean preoperative IPSS, IIEF-5, and FSFI-6 scores were 9.35, 12.18, and 6.09, respectively.

The clustering analysis was performed in ten different bulk tumor transcriptomic datasets and in a single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) dataset, respectively. We identified two PC subtypes: PC immunity high (PC-ImH) and PC immunity low (PC-ImL), consistently in these datasets. Compared to PC-ImL, PC-ImH displayed stronger immune signatures, worse clinical outcomes, higher epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signature, tumor stemness, intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) and genomic instability, and lower incidence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) showed no significant difference between PC-ImH and PC-ImL, while copy number alteration (CNA) was more significant in PC-ImL than in PC-ImH.

CKAP2L was confirmed to be the direct target of miR-326, which had a carcinostatic effect by binding the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of CKAP2L mRNA. The deletion of CKAP2L resulted in reduced expression of genes involved in the mitotic cell cycle such as multiple cyclin-dependent kinases and cyclins, but also several genes encoding proteins involved in chromosome segregation and spindle assembly.

Total tumor mutation burden (TMB) was higher among primary BRCA2d tumors, although pathogenic TMB did not differ by tumor BRCA2 status. Pathogenic and total single nucleotide variant (SNV) frequencies at KMT2D were higher in BRCA2d primary tumors, as was the total SNV frequency at KMT2D in BRCA2d metastatic tumors. Homozygous deletions at NEK3, RB1, and APC were enriched in BRCA2d primary tumors, and RB1 deletions in metastatic BRCA2d tumors as well. TMPRSS2-ETV1 fusions were more common in BRCA2d tumors.

Interplay between lncRNAs' aberrant methylation and expression in prostate cancer (PC) progression still remains largely elusive. Therefore, this study characterized the genome-wide epigenetic landscape and expression profiles of lncRNAs and their clinical impact by integrating multi-omics data implementing bioinformatics approaches. We identified 62 differentially methylated CpG-sites (DMCs) and 199 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), where 32 DElncRNAs contain 32 corresponding DMCs within promoter regions. Significant negative correlation was observed between 8 DElncRNAs-DMCs pairs. 3 (cg23614229, cg23957912, and cg11052780) DMCs and 4 (CACNA1G-AS1, F11-AS1, NNT-AS1, and MSC-AS1) DElncRNAs were identified as high-risk factors for poor prognosis of PC patients. Overexpression of hypo-methylated CACNA1G-AS1, F11-AS1, and NNT-AS1 and down-regulation of hyper-methylated MSC-AS1 significantly lower the survival of PC patients and could be a potential prognostic and therapeutic biomarker. These DElncRNAs were found to be associated with several molecular functions whose deregulation can lead to cancer.

A replication-deficient adenoviral vector based on the simian adenovirus type Y25 and named ChAdOx1 has been evaluated in several clinical trials since 2012. The Brighton Collaboration Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy (BRAVATO) was formed to evaluate the safety and other key features of new platform technology vaccines. This manuscript reviews key features of the ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines. The simian adenovirus Y25 was chosen as a strategy to circumvent pre-existing immunity to common human adenovirus serotypes which could impair immune responses induced by adenoviral vectored vaccines. Deletion of the E1 gene renders the ChAdOx1 vector replication incompetent and further genetic engineering of the E3 and E4 genes allows for increased insertional capability and optimizes vaccine manufacturing processes. ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines can be manufactured in E1 complementing cell lines at scale and are thermostable. The first ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines approved for human use, against SARS-CoV-2, received emergency use authorization in the UK on 30th December 2020, and is now approved in more than 180 countries. Safety data were compiled from phase I-III clinical trials of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines expressing different antigens (influenza, tuberculosis, malaria, meningococcal B, prostate cancer, MERS-CoV, Chikungunya, Zika and SARS-CoV-2), conducted by the University of Oxford, as well as post marketing surveillance data for the COVID-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Overall, ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines have been well tolerated. Very rarely, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), capillary leak syndrome (CLS), immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) have been reported following mass administration of the COVID-19 Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The benefits of this COVID-19 vaccination have outweighed the risks of serious adverse events in most settings, especially with mitigation of risks when possible. Extensive immunogenicity clinical evaluation of ChAdOx1 vectored vaccines reveal strong, durable humoral and cellular immune responses to date; studies to refine the COVID-19 protection (e.g., via homologous/heterologous booster, fractional dose) are also underway. New prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines based on the ChAdOx1 vector are currently undergoing pre-clinical and clinical assessment, including vaccines against viral hemorrhagic fevers, Nipah virus, HIV, Hepatitis B, amongst others.""","""['Pedro M Folegatti', 'Daniel Jenkin', 'Susan Morris', 'Sarah Gilbert', 'Denny Kim', 'James S Robertson', 'Emily R Smith', 'Emalee Martin', 'Marc Gurwith', 'Robert T Chen;Benefit-Risk Assessment of VAccines by TechnolOgy Working Group BRAVATO', ' ex-VSWG)']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Vaccine""","""['Vaccines based on replication incompetent Ad26 viral vectors: Standardized template with key considerations for a risk/benefit assessment.', 'Safety and immunogenicity of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine against SARS-CoV-2: a preliminary report of a phase 1/2, single-blind, randomised controlled trial.', 'Safety and immunogenicity of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine administered in a prime-boost regimen in young and old adults (COV002): a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial.', 'Immunogenicity and safety of an inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine (VLA2001) compared with the adenoviral vector vaccine ChAdOx1-S in adults in the UK (COV-COMPARE): interim analysis of a randomised, controlled, phase 3, immunobridging trial.', 'Efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.', 'Immunogenicity Differences of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine According to Pre-Existing Adenovirus Immunity.']"""

The aim of the present study was to report on long-term toxicities after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of prostate cancer patients with previous surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.  Materials and methods:   Among 150 patients treated with SBRT (median dose 36.25 Gy in five fractions) realised from 2014 to 2019 in a single-centre institution, data of 24 men with a history of TURP (n = 19) or adenomectomy (n = 5) were analysed. Repeated TURP was carried out in three patients, with a median time between surgery and SBRT of 54 months. Genitourinary toxicity was assessed using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.0 grading scale.  Results:   With a median follow-up of 45 months, 10 of 24 (42%) patients experienced at least one episode of transient haematuria. One patient (4%) with three previous TURP presented a grade 3 acute non-infective cystitis. Late grade 2 and 3 genitourinary toxicities were observed in eight (33%) and four patients (17%) (two treated with adenomectomy, one with multiple TURP and one with a 140 cm3 prostate size), respectively, with no grade ≥4 adverse events. A complete recovery of grade 3 genitourinary toxicities was observed for all patients after hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

Highly sensitive recognition of PSA is one of the virtues of the proposed method which comes from the use of unique features of both CRISPR-Cas12a and DNA structure in the design of the aptasensor. The presence of PSA creates a cruciform DNA nanostructure in the sample which can be loaded by PG and make sharp fluorescence emission. While, when there is no PSA, the CRISPR-Cas12a digests sequences 1 and 3 as single-stranded DNAs, causing no DNA structure and a negligible fluorescence is detected after addition of PG. This aptasensor presents a sensitive recognition performance with detection limit of 4 pg/mL and a practical use for determination of PSA in serum samples.

Methods:   Effectiveness via PSA assessment in a randomized study on prostate irradiation with 20x3.3 Gy(RBE) protons versus carbon ions was analyzed in 92 patients. Proton RBE was based on a fixed RBE of 1.1 while the local effect model (LEM) I and an α/β = 2 Gy was used for carbon ions. The dose in the prostate was recalculated based on the delivered treatment plan using LEM I and LEM IV and different α/β values.  Results:   Five-year overall and progression free survival was 98% and 85% with protons and 91% and 50% with carbon ions, respectively, with the latter being unexpectedly low compared to Japanese carbon ion data and rather corresponding to a photon dose <72 Gy in 2 Gy fractions. According to LEM I and the applied α/β-value of 2 Gy, the applied carbon ion dose in 2 Gy(RBE) fractions (EQD2) was 87.46 Gy(RBE). Recalculations confirmed a strong dependence of RBE-weighted dose on the α/β ratio as well as on the RBE-model.  Conclusion:   The data demonstrate a significant lower effectiveness of the calculated RBE-weighted dose in the carbon ion as compared to the proton arm. LEM I and an α/β = 2 Gy overestimates the RBE for carbon ions in prostate cancer treatment.

In addition, the lack of efficacy and selectivity of chemotherapeutic agents for cancer cells is a challenge that needs to be addressed through the development of new drugs. Since aminosteroids are of interest in fighting cancer, our group previously reported antiproliferative activity on several cancer cell lines of two representatives, RM-133 and RM-581. To extend the structure-activity relationship study of aminosteroids, of which RM-133 (androstane) and RM-581 (estrane) are the main candidates, we performed the chemical synthesis and biological evaluation on lung (SHP-77), breast (T-47D) and prostate (DU-145, PC-3 and LAPC-4) cancer cells of four analogues of RM-581. We moved the functionalized side chain from position 2 of the androstane and estrane derivatives to incorporate it into a new chain located at position 17. Chemical synthesis took place in 2 steps from steroidal side-chain carboxylic acids, allowing to obtain 4 steroid derivatives with acceptable yields, which were fully characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR). After the evaluation of compounds 12-15, lower antiproliferative activities varying from 12 to 54%, 0-33% and 0-63% were observed for SHP-77, DU-145 and PC-3 cell lines, respectively, while higher activities varying from 33 to 62% and 45-84% were observed for T-47D and LAPC-4 cell lines, respectively, when tested at 10 µM. Overall, it was observed that these aminosteroids have a lower cytotoxic activity than that of RM-581 and, that moving the side chain from steroid position C2 to C17 is clearly detrimental for antiproliferative activity.

This study aimed to investigate whether MRI-guided focused ultrasound focal therapy can safely reduce treatment burden for patients with localised grade group 2 or 3 intermediate-risk prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this single-arm, multicentre, phase 2b study conducted at eight health-care centres in the USA, we recruited men aged 50 years and older with unilateral, MRI-visible, primary, intermediate-risk, previously untreated prostate adenocarcinoma (prostate-specific antigen ≤20 ng/mL, grade group 2 or 3; tumour classification ≤T2) confirmed on combined biopsy (combining MRI-targeted and systematic biopsies). MRI-guided focused ultrasound energy, sequentially titrated to temperatures sufficient for tissue ablation (about 60-70°C), was delivered to the index lesion and a planned margin of 5 mm or more of normal tissue, using real-time magnetic resonance thermometry for intraoperative monitoring. Co-primary outcomes were oncological outcomes (absence of grade group 2 and higher cancer in the treated area at 6-month and 24-month combined biopsy; when 24-month biopsy data were not available and grade group 2 or higher cancer had occurred in the treated area at 6 months, the 6-month biopsy results were included in the final analysis) and safety (adverse events up to 24 months) in all patients enrolled in the study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01657942, and is no longer recruiting.  Findings:   Between May 4, 2017, and Dec 21, 2018, we assessed 194 patients for eligibility and treated 101 patients with MRI-guided focused ultrasound. Median age was 63 years (IQR 58-67) and median concentration of prostate-specific antigen was 5·7 ng/mL (IQR 4·2-7·5). Most cancers were grade group 2 (79 [78%] of 101). At 24 months, 78 (88% [95% CI 79-94]) of 89 men had no evidence of grade group 2 or higher prostate cancer in the treated area. No grade 4 or grade 5 treatment-related adverse events were reported, and only one grade 3 adverse event (urinary tract infection) was reported. There were no treatment-related deaths.  Interpretation:   24-month biopsy outcomes show that MRI-guided focused ultrasound focal therapy is safe and effectively treats grade group 2 or 3 prostate cancer.

Indirect comparisons can be used to assess relative efficacy and provide important information to guide treatment decisions. PROSPER and SPARTAN were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase III trials in patients with nmCRPC with overall similar study designs and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Using an anchored matching-adjusted indirect comparison, based on the final data from the PROSPER and SPARTAN studies, we assessed the comparative efficacy of enzalutamide and apalutamide, both plus androgen deprivation therapy.  Methods:   Using placebo as the common comparator, individual patient data from PROSPER were matched to the aggregate patient data from SPARTAN and efficacy endpoints from PROSPER were re-weighted accordingly. Patient baseline characteristics and endpoints were clinically and statistically tested to identify potential effect modifiers, according to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. Hazard ratios for overall survival (OS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and time to chemotherapy (TTCx) were re-estimated for PROSPER using weighted Cox proportional hazards models and indirectly compared with those of SPARTAN using a Bayesian network meta-analysis.  Results:   Estimated hazard ratios [95% credible interval (CrI)] for enzalutamide versus apalutamide were 0.80 (95% CrI 0.58-1.10) for OS, 0.94 (95% CrI 0.69-1.29) for MFS2, and 0.90 (95% CrI 0.63-1.29) for TTCx. Similar results were seen for sensitivity analyses conducted for OS and MFS. Bayesian probability analyses showed a 91.7% favoring enzalutamide for OS, 65.1% for MFS, and 71.4% for TTCx.  Conclusions:   The results of this matching-adjusted indirect comparison of final data from PROSPER and SPARTAN indicate comparable efficacy of enzalutamide and apalutamide with potentially a greater probability of longer MFS, OS, and TTCx in patients with nmCRPC treated with enzalutamide versus apalutamide.""","""['B Tombal', 'C N Sternberg', 'M Hussain', 'A Ganguli', 'Y Li', 'R Sandin', 'H Bhadauria', 'M Oh', 'F Saad']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ESMO Open""","""['Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of the Efficacy of Apalutamide and Enzalutamide with ADT in the Treatment of Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Matching-Adjusted Indirect Comparison of Health-Related Quality of Life and Adverse Events of Apalutamide Versus Enzalutamide in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Indirect Comparison of Darolutamide versus Apalutamide and Enzalutamide for Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of Nonmetastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Recent Advances and Future Direction.', 'Overall survival and adverse events after treatment with darolutamide vs. apalutamide vs. enzalutamide for high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   A UNET was trained to reconstruct susceptibility maps using synthetically generated, unwrapped, multi-echo phase data as input. The RMS error with respect to synthetic validation data was computed. The method was tested on two in vivo knee and two pelvis data sets. Comparisons were made to a conventional fat-water separation pipeline by applying a commonly used graph-cut algorithm, both without and with an extended mask for background field removal (FWS-CONV-QSM and FWS-MASK-CONV-QSM, respectively). Several regions of interest were segmented and compared. Furthermore, the approach was tested on a prostate cancer patient receiving low-dose-rate brachytherapy, to detect and localize the seeds by MRI.  Results:   The RMS error was 0.292 ppm with FWS-CONV-QSM and 0.123 ppm for the UNET approach. Susceptibility maps were reconstructed much faster (< 10 s) and completely automatically (no background masking needed) by the UNET compared with the other applied techniques (5 min 51 s and 22 min 44 s for CONV-QSM and FWS-MASK-CONV-QSM, respectively. Background artifacts, fat-water swaps, and hypointense artifacts between I-125 seeds of a patient receiving low-dose brachytherapy in the prostate were largely reduced in the UNET approach.

We relied on an institutional tertiary-care database to identify BOO patients who underwent either transurethral loop resection or laser (Holmium:yttrium-aluminium garnet) enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) between 01/2012 and 12/2019. Embedding methods differed with regard to the extent of the additional prostate tissue submitted following the first ten cassettes of primary embedding (cohort A: one [additional] cassette/10 g residual tissue vs. cohort B: complete embedding of the residual tissue). Detection rates of iPCa among the different embedding methods were compared. Subsequently, subgroup analyses by embedding protocol were repeated in HoLEP-treated patients only. In the overall cohort, the iPCa detection rate was 11% (46/420). In cohort A (n = 299), tissue embedding resulted in a median of 8 cassettes/patient (range 1-38) vs. a median of 15 (range 2-74) in cohort B (n = 121) (p < .001). The iPCa detection rate was 8% (23/299) and 19% (23/121) in cohort A vs. cohort B, respectively (p < .001). Virtual reduction of the number of tissue cassettes to ten cassettes resulted in a iPCa detection rate of 96% in both cohorts, missing one stage T1a/ISUP grade 1 carcinoma. Increasing the number of cassettes by two and eight cassettes, respectively, resulted in a detection rate of 100% in both cohorts without revealing high-grade carcinomas. Subgroup analyses in HoLEP patients confirmed these findings, demonstrated by a 100 vs. 96% iPCa detection rate following examination of the first ten cassettes, missing one case of T1a/ISUP 1. Examination of 8 additional cassettes resulted in a 100% detection rate. The extent of embedding of material obtained from transurethral prostate resection correlates with the iPCa detection rate.

We previously identified miR-628-5p (miR-628) as a potential biomarker in serum samples from men with prostate cancer (PCa) (Srivastava et al. in Tumour Biol 35:4867-4873, 10.1007/s13277-014-1638-1, 2014). This study examined the detailed cellular phenotypes and pathways regulated by miR-628 in PCa cells. Since obesity is a significant risk factor for PCa, and there is a correlation between levels of the obesity-associated hormone leptin and PCa development, here we investigated the functional relationship between leptin and miR-628 regulation in PCa. We demonstrated that exposure to leptin downregulated the expression of miR-628 and increased cell proliferation/migration in PCa cells. We next studied the effects on cancer-related phenotypes in PCa cells after altering miR-628 expression levels. Enforced expression of miR-628 in PCa cells inhibited cell proliferation, reduced PCa cell survival/migration/invasion/spheroid formation, and decreased markers of cell stemness. Mechanistically, miR-628 binds with the JAG1-3'UTR and inhibits the expression of Jagged-1 (JAG1). JAG1 inhibition by miR-628 downregulated Notch signaling, decreased the expression of Snail/Slug, and modulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasiveness in PC3 cells. Furthermore, expression of miR-628 in PCa cells increased sensitivity towards the drugs enzalutamide and docetaxel by induction of cell apoptosis. Collectively our data suggest that miR-628 is a key regulator of PCa carcinogenesis and is modulated by leptin, offering a novel therapeutic opportunity to inhibit the growth of advanced PCa.""","""['Leslimar Rios-Colon#', 'Juliet Chijioke#', 'Suryakant Niture', 'Zainab Afzal', 'Qi Qi', 'Anvesha Srivastava', 'Malathi Ramalinga', 'Habib Kedir', 'Patrice Cagle', 'Elena Arthur', 'Mitu Sharma', 'John Moore', 'Gagan Deep', 'Simeng Suy', 'Sean P Collins', 'Deepak Kumar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['MicroRNA-99b-5p targets mTOR/AR axis, induces autophagy and inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation.', 'miR-221-5p regulates proliferation and migration in human prostate cancer cells and reduces tumor growth in vivo.', 'MicroRNA-498 promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells and decreases radiation sensitivity by targeting PTEN.', 'Micro-RNA-186-5p inhibition attenuates proliferation, anchorage independent growth and invasion in metastatic prostate cancer cells.', 'Prostate cancer and microRNAs: New insights into apoptosis.', 'The Modulation of Adipokines, Adipomyokines, and Sleep Disorders on Carcinogenesis.', 'MicroRNA-483-5p Inhibits Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Proliferation, Cell Steatosis, and Fibrosis by Targeting PPARα and TIMP2.', 'Genetic alterations in CREBRF influence prostate cancer survival and impact prostate tissue homeostasis in mice.', 'Notch signaling, hypoxia, and cancer.', ""Using ncRNAs as Tools in Cancer Diagnosis and Treatment-The Way towards Personalized Medicine to Improve Patients' Health.""]"""

Methods:   To realize the possibility of PRAD patients benefiting from ICIS treatment, we analyzed the mutation spectrum of all PRAD patients, calculated the TMB of each PRAD patient, and divided the patients into high TMB group and low TMB group. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were identified and path analysis was carried out. The immune cell infiltration of each PRAD patient was evaluated and survival analysis was performed to explore the effect of immune cell infiltration on the prognosis.  Results:   We found that high TMB was associated with better survival outcomes, with higher TMB scores in young patients, T2 and N0 patients. 28 hub genes were screened by the overlap between 229 DEGs and immune-related genes. T cells CD8 and CD4 memory activated in the high TMB group were higher than those in the low TMB group, while Mast cells resting in the low TMB group were higher than that in the high TMB group. High neutrophil infiltration is associated with poor prognosis in patients with PRAD.

TP53 mutations are relatively prevalent in advanced PCa forms. We aimed to utilize this knowledge to identify robust transcriptomic signatures for BCR prediction in patients with Gleason score ≥ 7 cancers, which cause most PCa deaths. Using the TCGA-PRAD dataset and the novel data-driven stochastic approach proposed in this study, we identified a 25-gene signature from the genes whose expression in tumors was associated with TP53 mutation statuses. The predictive strength of the signature was assessed by AUC and Fisher's exact test p-value according to the output of support vector machine-based cross validation. For the TCGA-PRAD dataset, the AUC and p-value were 0.837 and 5 × 10-13, respectively. For five external datasets, the AUCs and p-values ranged from 0.632 to 0.794 and 6 × 10-2 to 5 × 10-5, respectively. The signature also performed well in predicting relapse-free survival (RFS).

However, the decision to intervene ultimately rests on patient and physician preferences. The appropriate intervention in many clinical situations is typically defined by clinically relevant, actionable subgroups based upon the probability of malignancy. However, the ""all-or-nothing"" approach of threshold-based decisions is in practice incorrect.  Methods:   Here, we present a novel approach to understanding clinical decision-making, the intervention probability curve (IPC). The IPC models the likelihood that an intervention will be chosen as a continuous function of the probability of disease. We propose the cumulative distribution function as a suitable model. The IPC is explored using the National Lung Screening Trial and the Prostate Lung Colorectal and Ovarian Screening Trial datasets.  Results:   Fitting the IPC results in a continuous curve as a function of pretest probability of cancer with high correlation (R2 &gt; 0.97 for each) with fitted parameters closely aligned with professional society guidelines.  Conclusions:   The IPC allows analysis of intervention decisions in a continuous, rather than threshold-based, approach to further understand the role of biomarkers and risk models in clinical practice.

Method:   We performed a retrospective analysis of 285 patients treated for bladder cancer at the Duke University Health System from 1996 to 2017. Abdominal CT images were manually segmented at L3 using Slice-O-Matic. Automated segmentation was performed with ABACS on the same L3-level images. Measures of interest were skeletal muscle (SM) area, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) area, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) area. SM index, SAT index, and VAT index were calculated by dividing component areas by patient height2 (m2). Patients were dichotomized as sarcopenic, having excessive subcutaneous fat, or having excessive visceral fat using published cut-off values. Agreement between manual and automated segmentation was assessed using the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC), the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC3), and the kappa statistic (κ).  Results:   There was strong agreement between manual and automatic segmentation, with PPMCCs > 0.90 and ICC3s > 0.90 for SM, SAT, and VAT areas. Categorization of patients as sarcopenic (κ = 0.73), having excessive subcutaneous fat (κ = 0.88), or having excessive visceral fat (κ = 0.90) displayed high agreement between methods.

Here, through analysis of large panel-based genomic datasets from the AACR Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange project, including 40,979 primary and metastatic tumors across 25 distinct cancer types, we explore how the evolutionary pressure of cancer metastasis shapes the selection of genomic drivers of cancer. The most commonly affected genes were TP53, MYC, and CDKN2A, with no specific pattern associated with metastatic disease. This suggests that, on a driver mutation level, the selective pressure operating in primary and metastatic tumors is similar. The most highly enriched individual driver mutations in metastatic tumors were mutations known to drive resistance to hormone therapies in breast and prostate cancer (ESR1 and AR), anti-EGFR therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (EGFR T790M), and imatinib in gastrointestinal cancer (KIT V654A). Specific mutational signatures were also associated with treatment in three cancer types, supporting clonal selection following anticancer therapy. Overall, this implies that initial acquisition of driver mutations is predominantly shaped by the tissue of origin, where specific mutations define the developing primary tumor and drive growth, immune escape, and tolerance to chromosomal instability. However, acquisition of driver mutations that contribute to metastatic disease is less specific, with the main genomic drivers of metastatic cancer evolution associating with resistance to therapy.

Herein, new PKN3 shRNA sequences (shPKN3-2459 and shPKN3-3357) were designed, and bioreducible, biodegradable, ionizable lipid-based nanoparticles were developed for shPKN3 delivery. First, an ionizable lipid (DDA-SS-DMA) bridged with disulfide bond and ester bonds was synthesized by a three-step reaction and confirmed by MS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR. The ionizable lipid was mixed with cholesterol, DSPC, PEG-lipid, and shPKN3 by a microfluidic mixer to prepare lipid nanoparticles (LNP-shPKN3) which were characterized by DLS and TEM. Afterward, the pH and glutathione (GSH)-responsiveness of the DDA-SS-DMA based LNP delivery system were investigated by lysosome escape and gel electrophoresis assays. Compared with the commercial transfection reagent Lipo2000, the DDA-SS-DMA based delivery system showed higher transfection efficiency and lower toxicity. Western blot analysis, invasion tests, and migration assays were performed to evaluate the silencing effect of shPKN3 in vitro. In in vivo studies, high tumor suppression (65.8%) and treatment safety were evident in the LNP-shPKN3-2459 treatment group.

We performed AR chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing on primary prostate tumors from AA and EA men, finding that sites with greater AR binding intensity in AA relative to EA prostate cancer are enriched for lipid metabolism and immune response genes. Integration with transcriptomic and metabolomic data demonstrated coinciding upregulation of lipid metabolism gene expression and increased lipid levels in AA prostate cancer. In a metastatic prostate cancer cohort, upregulated lipid metabolism associated with poor prognosis. These findings offer the first insights into ancestry-specific differences in the prostate cancer AR cistrome.

To understand the prostate cancer experience, it is important to understand the experience of same-aged men without prostate cancer as a basis for comparison. This study provides the US population reference values for six patient-reported outcome (PRO) questionnaires.  Methods:   A cross-sectional online survey, including several PRO questionnaires, was administered in 2019 to a representative sample of US adults. The male sample (N = 876) was raked by age to have similar characteristics of men in key advanced prostate cancer trials (mean/median age: 67.5/70.0 years), with the majority being white and non-Hispanic.  Results:   Results from six PRO questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory; Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders 2.0 Cognitive Short Form; PRO Measurement Information System Fatigue-Short Form; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30; and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Prostate Cancer Module) indicated that the US representative sample of men have good role, physical, and emotional functioning but slightly impaired social, functional, and overall well-being. In addition, they have normal cognitive function, few financial problems, minimal pain and fatigue, minimal urinary and bowel symptoms, and limited use of incontinence aids.  Conclusions:   The availability of the reference values for these PRO questionnaires will enable researchers to compare the HRQoL of patients with advanced prostate cancer in the US with that of the general US population and allow for a better interpretation of those scores.

Accurate tumour delineation on HP-13C-MRI is vital for quantitative assessment of the underlying tissue metabolism. However, there is no consensus on the optimum method for segmenting HP-13C-MRI, and whole-mount pathology (WMP) as the histopathological gold-standard is only available for surgical patients. Although proton MRI can be used for tumour delineation, this approach significantly underestimates tumour volume, and metabolic tumour segmentation based on HP-13C-MRI could provide an important functional metric of tumour volume. In this study, we quantified metabolism using HP-13C-MRI and segmentation approaches based on WMP maps, 1H-MRI-derived T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and HP-13C-MRI-derived total carbon signal-to-noise ratio maps (TC-SNR) with an SNR threshold of 5.0. 13C-labelled pyruvate SNR, lactate SNR, TC-SNR, and the pyruvate-to-lactate exchange rate constant (kPL) were significantly higher when measured using the TC-SNR-guided approach, which also corresponded to a significantly higher tumour epithelial expression on RNAscope imaging of the enzyme catalysing pyruvate-to-lactate metabolism (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)). However, linear regression and Bland-Altman analyses demonstrated a strong linear relationship between all three segmentation approaches, which correlated significantly with RNA-scope-derived epithelial LDH expression. These results suggest that standard-of-care T2WI and TC-SNR maps could be used as clinical reference tools for segmenting localised PCa on HP-13C-MRI in the absence of the WMP gold standard. The TC-SNR-guided approach could be used clinically to target biopsies towards highly glycolytic tumour areas and therefore to sample aggressive disease with higher precision. KEY POINTS: • T2WI- and TC-SNR-guided segmentations can be used in all PCa patients and do not explicitly require WMP maps. • Agreement between the three segmentation approaches is biologically validated by their strong relationship with epithelial LDH mRNA expression. • The TC-SNR-guided approach can potentially be used to identify occult disease on 1H-MRI and target the most glycolytically active regions.""","""['Nikita Sushentsev', 'Mary A McLean', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Cara Brodie', 'Julia Jones', 'Ferdia A Gallagher', 'Tristan Barrett']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate MRI detects real-time metabolic flux in prostate cancer metastases to bone and liver: a clinical feasibility study.', 'Investigation of analysis methods for hyperpolarized 13C-pyruvate metabolic MRI in prostate cancer patients.', 'Hyperpolarised 13C-MRI identifies the emergence of a glycolytic cell population within intermediate-risk human prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The use of hyperpolarised 13C-MRI in clinical body imaging to probe cancer metabolism.']"""

Patients and methods:   The clinical data of 251 patients with PCa, who were initially diagnosed in our hospital from February 2015 to October 2021, were retrospectively analyzed. According to the whole-body bone scan results, patients were divided into the bone metastasis group (n = 66) and the non-bone metastasis group (n = 185). The patient's age, total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA), free PSA (fPSA), prostate volume, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gleason score, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and pelvic lymph node metastasis were collected. Univariate correlation and multivariate regression analyses, together with receiver operating characteristic curve, were used to analyze PCa bone metastasis-related factors.  Results:   The incidence of bone metastasis in newly diagnosed PCa was about 26.29% (66/251). Among them, the incidence of pelvic metastasis was the highest, at 78.78% (52/251), and multiple bone metastases were significantly higher than single bone metastasis (80.31% vs. 19.69%). Univariate correlation analysis indicated that age, Gleason score, ESR, TPSA, ALP, fPSA/PSA, capsular infiltration, and pelvic lymph node metastasis (p < 0.05) were highly correlated with PCa bone metastasis. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that TPSA (95% CI: 0.977-1.284, p = 0.007), ALP (95% CI: 1.008-1.080, p = 0.016), Gleasons core (95% CI: 2.110-82.349, p = 0.006), ESR (95% CI: 1.062-1.104, p = 0.003), and pelvic lymph node metastasis (95% CI: 1.537--33.239, p = 0.012) were independent risk factors for bone metastasis of PCa. The cut-off values for TPSA, ALP, Gleason score, and ESR were 33.78 ng/ml, 73.65 U/L, 7.5, and 23.5 mm/h, respectively. Additionally, the respective sensitivities for TPSA, ALP, Gleason score, and ESR were 81.8%, 75.8%, 68.2% and 77.3%, and the respective specificities was 90.3%, 98.9%, 98.4%, and 74.6%.

Methods:   The active compounds and their corresponding putative targets of PF were identified by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP), the gene names of the targets were obtained from the UniProt database. The collection of genes associated with PCa was obtained from GeneCards and DisGeNET database. We merged the drug targets and disease targets by online software, Draw Venn Diagram. The resulting gene list was imported into R software (v3.6.3) for GO and KEGG function enrichment analysis. The STRING database was utilized for protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. The cytoHubba plugin of Cytoscape was used to identify core genes. Further, molecular docking analysis of the hub targets was carried out using AutoDock Vina software (v1.5.6).  Results:   A total of six active components were screened by PF, with 167 corresponding putative targets, 1395 related targets for PCa, and 113 targets for drugs and diseases. The 'drug-component-disease-target' network was constructed by Cytoscape software and the target genes mainly involved in the complex treating effects associated with response to oxidative stress, cytokine activity, pathways in cancer, PCa pathway, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. Core genes in the PPI network were TNF, JUN, IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, RELA, CCL2, TP53, IL10, and FOS. The molecular docking results reveal the better binding affinity of six active components to the core targets.

There are well documented decreases in the rates of screening and diagnostic testing for many cancers in 2020, with commensurate stage migration of cancers when they are eventually detected. We aimed to determine whether there was a decrease in the rate of prostate cancer (PC) screening and testing in Australia in 2020.  Method:   Data was extracted from the Department of Human Services (DHS) website for Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) item numbers for tests pertinent to detection of Prostate Cancer. This data is de-identified and publicly available. Data was analysed at both a national, and a state level.  Results:   For 2020 nationwide the percentage change for prostate cancer testing was minor with 97% as many PSA tests, 99% as many prostate MRIs, and 105% as many prostate biopsies as the average for the preceding years. The differences were not significant (PSA tests p = 0.059 and prostate biopsies p = 0.109). The predicted values are fairly similar to both the average values for the preceding 5 years and the actual number of tests done in 2020. With exception of PSA tests in Victoria the actual number of tests performed was within the 95% Prediction Interval (performed: 167,426; predicted 171,194-196,699; p = 0.015).  Conclusion:   The current pandemic has had a widespread reach across Australia, with varying impact across each state and territory.

Materials and methods:   We identified 21,589 men who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (PCa) and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) from 2003 to 2017. The primary outcome was the incontinence procedure performances. Optum's de-identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database was queried to define the cohort of interest. The average costs of the different incontinence procedures were obtained and compared. Also, demographic, and clinical predictors of incontinence surgery were evaluated by multivariable regression analysis.  Results:   Of the 21,589 men with localized PCa treated with RP, 740 (3.43%) underwent at least one incontinence procedure during a median of 5 years of follow-up. In total, there were 844 unique incontinence procedures. Male slings were the most common procedure (47.5%), had an intermediate cost compared to the other treatment options, and was the first-choice treatment for the majority of patients (50%). The use of an artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) was the second most common (35.3%), but also was the most expensive treatment and was first-choice-treatment for 32.3% of patients. On multivariable analysis, metabolic syndrome related disorders, adjuvant/salvage radiation therapy as well as a history of neurological comorbidities were independently associated with an increased likelihood of incontinence surgery.  Conclusions:   The receipt of male slings increased and then subsequently decreased, while AUS utilization was stable, and the use of urethral bulking agents was uncommon. From a cost standpoint, AUS was the most expensive option.

We observe that a significant proportion of variance in disease liability is explained by the genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i.e., SNP-based heritability on the liability scale is estimated as 10.06% (SE 0.70%). Moreover, we find 55 genome-wide significant SNPs for the disease, using a genome-wide association study.

A limited number of studies have shown the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in prostate cancer tissues. However, there is a dearth of data exploring EBV latency profile in prostate cancer, and the relationship of EBV with histopathological features of prostate cancer. In this study, prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples were screened for the presence of EBV, followed by the characterization of the EBV latency profile and analysis of histopathological parameters in EBV-positive and EBV-negative groups. A conventional PCR strategy was employed using virus-specific primers to screen EBV in 99 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate cancer and 33 BPH samples received for histopathological analysis during the years 2019-2020. Subsequently, cDNA samples were used in a qPCR array to analyze the expression of EBV latency-associated genes to map the latency profile EBV maintains in the samples. Finally, statistical analyses were performed to determine the correlation between EBV and several histopathological features of the samples. EBV was detected in 39% of prostate cancer and 24% of BPH samples. The histopathological analysis of prostate cancer samples identified all samples as prostatic adenocarcinoma of acinar type, while statistical analyses revealed EBV-positive samples to exhibit significantly higher (p < 0.05) Gleason major and total Gleason scores as compared to EBV-negative samples. In the EBV-positive samples, variable expression patterns of latency-associated genes were observed, where most of the samples exhibited EBV latency II/III-like profiles in prostate cancer, while latency-II-like profiles in BPH samples. This study suggests a high prevalence of EBV in prostate samples, where EBV exhibited latency II/III-like profiles. Furthermore, EBV-positive samples exhibited a higher Gleason score suggesting a possible link between EBV and the onset/progression of prostate cancers. However, future functional studies are required to understand the role of the EBV gene expression profile in the onset/progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Khalid Ahmed#', 'Alisalman Sheikh#', 'Saira Fatima', 'Ghulam Haider', 'Kulsoom Ghias', 'Farhat Abbas', 'Nouman Mughal', 'Syed Hani Abidi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Frequency of Epstein–Barr Virus DNA in Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded Tissue of Patients with Ductal Breast Carcinoma.', 'Epstein-Barr virus presence in pediatric diffuse large B-cell lymphoma reveals a particular association and latency patterns: analysis of viral role in tumor microenvironment.', 'The BHLF1 Locus of Epstein-Barr Virus Contributes to Viral Latency and B-Cell Immortalization.', 'Molecular Basis of Epstein-Barr Virus Latency Establishment and Lytic Reactivation.', 'Epstein-Barr virus gene expression and latency pattern in gastric carcinomas: a systematic review.', 'The Association between Infectious Mononucleosis and Cancer: A Cohort Study of 24,190 Outpatients in Germany.', 'CMV and EBV Co-Infection in HIV-Infected Children: Infection Rates and Analysis of Differential Expression of Cytokines in HIV Mono- and HIV-CMV-EBV Co-Infected Groups.', 'Resurrecting Epstein-Barr Virus.']"""

Methods and materials:   A population-based cohort of 568 prostate cancer patients treated with combined EBRT and LDR-PB from 2010 to 2016 was analyzed. All patients received EBRT followed by LDR-PB boost. Outcomes were compared with the results for the brachytherapy arm of the ASCENDE-RT trial.  Results:   The median followup was 4.5 years. Sixty-nine percent (N = 391) had HR disease. Ninety-four percent of the HR and 57% of UIR were treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with a median duration of 12 months. The 5-year K-M biochemical progression-free survival (b-PFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS) were 84 ± 2%, 90 ± 2%, and 88 ± 2%, similar to 89 ± 5%, 94 ± 4%, and 92 ± 4% for the ASCENDE-RT LDR-PB arm.

Robotic palpation systems can objectively acquire stiffness conditions of the prostate.  Methods:   A 2DoF cable driven robotic system for prostate palpation is proposed. An indirect method to estimate the contact force based on cable tension observation is presented. Kinematic models and a joint angle estimation method to determine the tip position of the probe are derived. Positioning accuracy was verified using an optical marker tracking system and by displacement measurement, respectively. The contact force estimation method was validated on silicone phantom samples.  Results:   A good consistence between the estimated and measured contact force was observed. The contact force was correlated with the elastic modulus of each silicone phantom. There was also a good agreement between the theoretical and the measured tip position.  Conclusion:   In the proposed palpation system, the indirect contact force estimation method is viable and holds potential for the stiffness assessment of the prostate.

Numerical information is especially challenging to process for many patients, yet no empirical data shows whether numerical information influences how well they could process and recall it.  Method:   Using natural language processing tools, we estimated the amount of numerical and probability-related (quantitative) information that was provided in 112 paired urology-radiology clinical consultations with patients who had been recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. The primary outcome measured was patient knowledge about their prostate cancer outcomes assessed before and after the consultations.  Results:   Patients with prostate cancer, Gleason score 6 or 7, and stage Time 1 or Time 2 participated in the study. Paired consultations included on average 11,086 words spoken. The relationship between quantitative information provided in consultations and patient knowledge about their cancer outcomes followed an inverted U-shape. There was a positive association between quantitative information and patient knowledge about their cancer outcomes. However, after the amount of quantitative information exceeded 4% (422 quantitative words) in paired consultations, the relationships between knowledge and the number of quantitative words became negative. Individual differences in education were not associated with observed relationships.  Conclusion:   Despite concerns about patients' capacity to process quantitative information, we found that patients' knowledge about cancer risks is positively associated with a certain amount of quantitative information. In the consultations, patients need to receive quantitative information that is well balanced with qualitative explanations.

Results:   Among 21 946 participants, 454 total, 89 stomach, 67 colorectal, 51 lung, 39 breast and 99 prostate invasive cancer cases were newly diagnosed in the cancer registry. For invasive cancer, the sensitivity and specificity of the definition that combined codes for diagnosis and procedures for cancer therapy were 87.0% and 99.4% for total, 88.8% and 99.9% for stomach, 80.6% and 99.9% for colorectal, 86.3% and 99.9% for lung, 100% and 99.9% for breast and 91.9% and 99.9% for prostate cancer, respectively.

We aimed to investigate the associations of IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 concentrations with overall, aggressive and early-onset prostate cancer.  Methods:   Prospective analysis of biomarkers using the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group dataset (up to 20 studies, 17 009 prostate cancer cases, including 2332 aggressive cases). Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer were estimated using conditional logistic regression. For IGF-I, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was undertaken using instruments identified using UK Biobank (158 444 men) and outcome data from PRACTICAL (up to 85 554 cases, including 15 167 aggressive cases). Additionally, we used colocalization to rule out confounding by linkage disequilibrium.  Results:   In observational analyses, IGF-I was positively associated with risks of overall (OR per 1 SD = 1.09: 95% CI 1.07, 1.11), aggressive (1.09: 1.03, 1.16) and possibly early-onset disease (1.11: 1.00, 1.24); associations were similar in MR analyses (OR per 1 SD = 1.07: 1.00, 1.15; 1.10: 1.01, 1.20; and 1.13; 0.98, 1.30, respectively).

Patients and methods:   This national population-based study used linked cancer registry data and administrative hospital-level data for all 16 621 patients who were diagnosed between 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2018 with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or radical radiation therapy (RT) in the English National Health Service (NHS). Travel times by car to treating centres were estimated using a geographic information system. We used logistic regression to assess the impact of the relative proximity of alternative treatment options on the type of treatment received, with adjustment for patient characteristics.  Results:   Of the 78 NHS hospitals that provide RT or RP for prostate cancer, 41% provide both, 36% provide RT and 23% provide RP. Compared to patients who had both treatment options available at their nearest centre where overall 57% of patients received RT and 43% RP, patients were less likely to receive RT if their nearest centre offered RP only and the extra travel time to a hospital providing RT was >15 min (52% of patients received RT and 48% RP%, odds ratio [OR] 0.70 (0.58-0.85); P < 0.001). Conversely, patients were more likely to receive RT if their nearest centre offered RT and the extra travel time to a hospital providing RP was >15 min (63% of patients received RT and 37% RP, OR 1.23 (1.08-1.40); P < 0.001). There was a negligible impact on the type of treatment received if centres providing alternative treatment options were ≤15-min travel time from each other.  Conclusion:   The relative proximity of prostate cancer treatment options to a patient's residence is an independent predictor for the type of radical treatment received.

In a previous study, we have shown that a risk classification combining prostate-specific antigen ≥100 ng/mL and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 ≥ 320 pg/mL can predict survivals. We investigated the long-term usefulness of serum chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 as a complementary biomarker to prostate-specific antigen and developed a novel risk classification system.  Methods:   Serum samples were collected from 379 patients who underwent prostate biopsy at Kanazawa University Hospital between 2007 and 2013, and 255 patients with histologically diagnosed prostate cancer were included in this study. We retrospectively examined the efficacy of serum chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 as a prognostic biomarker.  Results:   Patients with chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 ≥ 320 pg/mL exhibited a significantly shorter overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival and castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival than those with chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 < 320 pg/mL. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine whether chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 was a useful prognostic factor. Independent significant predictors of worse overall survival were prostate-specific antigen ≥ 100 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥ 8 and chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 ≥ 320 pg/dL. Prognostic predictors of prostate cancer-specific survival or cancer-free survival in multivariate analysis were prostate-specific antigen ≥ 100 ng/mL and Gleason score ≥ 8. A novel risk classification system was created to predict overall survival in patients based on the number of risk factors present (chemokine (CC motif) ligand 2 ≥ 320 pg/mL, prostate-specific antigen ≥ 100 ng/mL, Gleason score ≥ 8).

Recently, the nucleoporin POM121 was found to have an important impact on intranuclear translocation of prostate cancer (PCa)-specific tumor drivers including the androgen receptor (AR). The aim of our study was to assess the potential of POM121 as a prognostic biomarker.  Methods:   Therefore, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for POM121 on a large clinically, well characterized PCa tissue cohort comprising benign prostatic samples, radical prostatectomy (RPE) samples, lymph node metastases, local recurrent tumors and distant metastases of 289 patients. Using a semi automated tissue image analysis software we evaluated POM121 protein expression level based on IHC.  Results:   We could show that POM121 expression increases during tumor progression. Expression levels were significantly higher in primary tumors compared to benign samples (P = 0.001), and substantially higher in advanced tumors (P < 0.001) and in distant metastases (P = 0.006) compared to primary tumors. Furthermore, POM121 expression predicts biochemical recurrence free survival (BFS) after surgery independent of the WHO group and other clinicopathological markers. 5-years BFS with primary tumors lacking POM121 and expressing POM121 was 88.8% and 68.9%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our study reveals the potential of POM121 as a potential biomarker for PCa, predicting BFS independent of other common clinicopathological parameters. Furthermore, POM121 might be a new targetable structure for patients suffering from advanced PCa.""","""['Finn Becker', 'Anne Offermann', 'Marie C Roesch', 'Vincent Joerg', 'Doris Roth', 'Verena Lubczyk', 'Rainer Kuefer', 'Verena Sailer', 'Jutta Kirfel', 'Axel S Merseburger', 'Sven Perner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['High level of androgen receptor is associated with aggressive clinicopathologic features and decreased biochemical recurrence-free survival in prostate: cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Increased mediator complex subunit CDK19 expression associates with aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Nuclear Pores Promote Lethal Prostate Cancer by Increasing POM121-Driven E2F1, MYC, and AR Nuclear Import.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.']"""

Established processes for patients to complete symptom screening using PROs were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study reports the implementation of a Radiation Therapist led ""champion"" model to support the use of PROs during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Methods:   Patient charts were audited May 3 to May 22, 2020 to measure the initial impact of the pandemic on weekly completion rates of PROs for patients receiving active radiation treatment. Beginning May 25, 2020, two Radiation Therapists acted as champions to promote the use of PROs among patients and staff. Weekly completion rates of PROs were monitored from May 25, 2020 to May 28, 2021. The type of Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) utilized and treatment intent was also recorded.  Results:   After implementing the champion model, the weekly completion of PROs increased to an average of 47.0 ± 11.7 (47.5 ± 12.6%) from the initial baseline average of 8.7 ± 1.5 (9.4 ± 2.1%). For PROs completed, the distribution of PROMs was an average of 37.2 ± 9.6 (47.7 ± 12.7%) and 9.8 ± 3.5 (47.0 ± 16.9%) for the Revised Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS-r) and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) respectively. An average of 5.1 ± 2.9 (26.3 ± 12.7%) and 41.9 ± 10.1 (52.4 ± 14.1%) was recorded for palliative and curative intent respectively.  Discussion:   An increased number of PROs were completed after implementing the Radiation Therapist led champion model. Patients receiving a radical course of treatment more frequently completed PROs, which in part reflects the longer treatment courses with increased opportunity for PROs to be completed.  Conclusion:   The Radiation Therapist led champion model supported ongoing monitoring and completion of PROs during the COVID-19 pandemic and has now been integrated into the department's standard clinical practice.""","""['Giovanna Wu', 'Kimberly McBride', 'James Loudon']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Challenges in virtual collection of patient-reported data: a prospective cohort study conducted in COVID-19 era.', 'Implementation of Electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes for Symptom Monitoring in a Large Multisite Community Oncology Practice: Dancing the Texas Two-Step Through a Pandemic.', 'An observational study evaluating the impact on prostate patient outcomes and experiences when radiation therapists use a standard grading system tool to assess and document treatment-related toxicities and interventions.', 'A review of the barriers to using Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) and Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in routine cancer care.', 'Implementing patient-reported outcomes in clinical decision-making within knee and hip osteoarthritis: an explorative review.']"""

Cancer service organizational surveys enable understanding of variation in structure, processes and outcomes of cancer care according to the availability of facilities and their geographical organisation. This is critical for evaluating the delivery of cancer care services across a specified region. Furthermore, the organisational survey provides essential information about patient support services which can be used to inform patients where particular allied health services are available. The National Prostate Cancer Audit (NPCA) is an audit of all prostate cancer services in England and Wales. The NPCA encompasses all prostate cancer diagnostics, treatments (including surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy) and allied services. The NPCA conducted an organisational survey in 2021 via an online questionnaire sent to the prostate cancer clinical leads within each of the 138 NHS providers and we had a response rate of 93 %. There are many challenges to conducting an organisational survey and gaining a high completion rate is still difficult. The challenges that the NPCA faced included accuracy, completion, duplicates and discrepancies in responses. From this experience, we have developed some suggestions for the practical delivery and development of future organisational surveys. It was thanks to the use of many of these strategies, and the engagement of clinicians with the NPCA, that we were able to achieve such a high response rate. Despite these challenges, the importance of organisational surveys of cancer services is demonstrated by the better understanding of structure, processes and outcomes of cancer care according to the accessibility of facilities and their geographical organisation.

By delivering a high dose of radiation from within the prostate gland, brachytherapy is an effective method of killing prostate cancer cells while limiting radiation dose to normal tissue. The main shortcomings of this treatment are: less efficacy against high grade tumor cells, acute urinary retention, and sub-acute urinary frequency and urgency. One strategy to improve brachytherapy is to incorporate therapeutics into brachytherapy. Drugs, such as docetaxel, can improve therapeutic efficacy, and dexamethasone is known to decrease urinary side effects. However, both therapeutics have high systemic side effects. To overcome this challenge, we hypothesized that we can incorporate therapeutics into the inert polymer spacers that are used to correctly space brachytherapy seeds during brachytherapy to enable local drug delivery. To accomplish this, we engineered 3D printed drug-loaded brachytherapy spacers using continuous liquid interface production (CLIP) with different surface patterns to control drug release. These devices have the same physical size as existing spacers, allowing them to easily replace commercial spacers. We examined these drug-loaded spacers using docetaxel and dexamethasone as model drugs in a murine model of prostate cancer. We found that drug-loaded spacers led to higher therapeutic efficacy for brachytherapy, and there was no discernable systemic toxicity from the drug-loaded spacers. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: There has been high interest in the application of 3D printing to engineer novel medical devices. However, such efforts have been limited by the lack of technologies that can fabricate devices suitable for real world medical applications. In this study, we demonstrate a unique application for 3D printing to enhance brachytherapy for cancer treatment. We engineered drug-loaded brachytherapy spacers that can be fabricated using Continuous Liquid Interface Production (CLIP) 3D printing, allowing tunable printing of drug-loaded devices, and implanted intraoperatively with brachytherapy seeds. In combined chemotherapy and brachytherapy we are able to achieve greater therapeutic efficacy through local drug delivery and without systemic toxicities. We believe our work will facilitate further investigation in medical applications of 3D printing.""","""['C Tilden Hagan', 'Cameron Bloomquist', 'Isaiah Kim', 'Nicole M Knape', 'James D Byrne', 'Litao Tu', 'Kyle Wagner', 'Sue Mecham', 'Joseph DeSimone', 'Andrew Z Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Biomater""","""['3D printed drug-loaded implantable devices for intraoperative treatment of cancer.', 'Controlling release from 3D printed medical devices using CLIP and drug-loaded liquid resins.', 'Nanoparticle-based brachytherapy spacers for delivery of localized combined chemoradiation therapy.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Does brachytherapy have a role in the treatment of prostate cancer?']"""

Symptoms of acute (within 90 days of completing SBRT) and late gastrointestinal and urinary toxic effects were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects version 5.0. Each symptom was scored according to the worst reported grading during treatment and the follow-up period. Cumulative rates of adverse effects between prostate-only SBRT (PO-SBRT) and whole pelvic SBRT (WP-SBRT) were compared using the χ2 test. Univariable and multivariable analysis was performed for possible factors affecting acute gastrointestinal and late urinary toxic effects.  Results:   A total of 220 patients were analyzed (PO-SBRT = 118, WP-SBRT = 102), with a median follow-up of 28 months (interquartile range, 14-40).

Interplay between inflammatory factors and cancer cells renders inflammatory tissue environment as a predisposing condition for cancer development. The Hippo pathway is a conserved signaling pathway across multiple species during evolution that regulates tissue homeostasis and organ development. Nevertheless, whether Hippo pathway regulates cancer-related inflammatory factors remains elusive. Here, we show that high cell density-mediated activation of the Hippo pathway blunts STAT3 activity in prostate cancer cells. Hippo pathway component MST2 kinase phosphorylates STAT3 at T622, which is located in the SH2 domain of STAT3. This phosphorylation blocks the SH2 domain in one STAT3 molecule to bind with the phosphorylated Y705 site in another STAT3 molecule, which further counteracts IL6-induced STAT3 dimerization and activation. Expression of a nonphosphorylatable STAT3 T622A mutant enhances STAT3 activity and IL6 expression at high cell density and promotes tumor growth in a mice xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that STAT3 is a novel phosphorylation substrate for MST2 and thereby highlight a regulatory cascade underlying the crosstalk between inflammation and the Hippo pathway in prostate cancer cells.""","""['Qingfeng Tang', 'Jing Fang', 'Weiqi Lai', 'Yu Hu', 'Chengwan Liu', 'Xiaobo Hu', 'Caiyong Song', 'Tianmu Cheng', 'Rui Liu', 'Xiaoke Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 through a phosphomimetic serine 727 promotes prostate tumorigenesis independent of tyrosine 705 phosphorylation.', 'Protein kinase Cepsilon interacts with signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3), phosphorylates Stat3Ser727, and regulates its constitutive activation in prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of STAT3 signaling targets both tumor-initiating and differentiated cell populations in prostate cancer.', 'Ursolic acid inhibits multiple cell survival pathways leading to suppression of growth of prostate cancer xenograft in nude mice.', 'Protein kinases of the Hippo pathway: regulation and substrates.', 'SH2 Domains: Folding, Binding and Therapeutical Approaches.']"""

We combined data from different databases, including The Cancer Genome Atlas, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, Genotype Tissue-Expression, cBioPortal, and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, to explore the potential oncogenic role of KIF2C in PCa through a series of bioinformatics approaches, including analysis of the association between KIF2C and prognosis, clinicopathological features, gene mutations, DNA methylation, immune cell infiltration, and drug resistance. The results showed that KIF2C was significantly up-regulated in PCa. High KIF2C expression was associated with age, pathological stage, lymph node metastases, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason score and significantly predicted an unfavorable prognosis in PCa patients. Results from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) suggested that KIF2C was involved in the cell cycle and immune response. KIF2C DNA methylation was reduced in PCa and was inversely linked with KIF2C expression. KIF2C was shown to have a strong relationship with the tumor microenvironment (TME), infiltrating cells, and immune checkpoint genes.

Our present study focused on CHRM1 to clarify its role in mediating autophagy in prostate cancer. We used immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence experiments to observe the expression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 both in nude mice with subcutaneous tumors and in prostate cancer cells. The autophagy was observed through transmission electron microscopy, western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunofluorescence. After that, we used lentivirus to establish CHRM1 and Atg5 knockdown models. Then, the migration and invasion abilities after knocking down muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 and Atg5 were detected by transwell assays. In addition, the AMPK/mTOR pathway-related targets were detected by western blotting. We found that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 was abundantly expressed both in vitro and in vivo in prostate cancer. The overexpression of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 positively regulated migration and invasion in tumor cells as well as the activation of autophagy. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 was highly correlated with Atg5 and activated the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. Downregulation of Atg5 inhibited cell autophagy in prostate cancer cells and the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Meanwhile, abnormal expressions of AMPK/mTOR pathway-related proteins were found. In conclusion, the present findings indicated that muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 is highly expressed in prostate cancer cells and promotes cell invasion and migration of prostate cancer. Autophagy is activated in prostate cancer cells and the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 positively regulates autophagy in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1 induces autophagy-mediated cell migration and invasion by targeting Atg5 in prostate cancer cells via AMPK/mTOR pathway, which uncovered that regulating muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 1, identified in this study, can be a promising solution for treating prostate cancer.""","""['Qianhui Wang', 'Jinying Chen', 'Mi Zhang', 'Hong Wang', 'Yan Zeng', 'Yanping Huang', 'Chen Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Oncol""","""['Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 mediates prostate cancer cell migration and invasion through hedgehog signaling.', 'Effect of electroacupuncture on hepatocyte autophagy and oxidative stress in SAMP8 mice by regulating AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 signaling pathway.', 'MicroRNA-21 promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion of non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells by regulating autophagy activity via AMPK/ULK1 signaling pathway.', 'Acetylcholine mediates AMPK-dependent autophagic cytoprotection in H9c2 cells during hypoxia/reoxygenation injury.', 'Long non-coding RNA PRRT3-AS1 silencing inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation and promotes apoptosis and autophagy.', 'Crosstalk Between Peripheral Innervation and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.', 'ANXA6/TRPV2 axis promotes lymphatic metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma by inducing autophagy.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote malignant phenotypes of prostate cancer cells via autophagy : Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate cancer development.']"""

Prior to the USPSTF's 2012 screening recommendation, previous studies found that insured patients with prostate cancer had better outcomes than uninsured patients.  Methods:   Using the SEER 18 database, we examined prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS) based on diagnostic time period and insurance status. Patients were designated as belonging to the pre-USPSTF era if diagnosed in 2010-2012 or post-USPSTF era if diagnosed in 2014-2016. PCSS was measured with the Kaplan-Meier method, while disparities were measured with the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   During the pre-USPSTF era, uninsured patients experienced worse PCSS compared to insured patients (adjusted HR 1.256, 95% CI 1.037-1.520, p = 0.020).

Methods:   In the procedural framework designed for the critical assessment of cost-effectiveness analyses, the quantifiability of an identified source of uncertainty is assessed through the input parameters of the originally submitted model, which is followed by the interpretation of its impact on estimates of costs and outcomes compared to the base case cost-effectiveness conclusion.  Results:   Based on our experiences with the recent reimbursement dossier of darolutamide, the significant and quantifiable sources of uncertainty were the time horizon of the economic analysis; the restriction of the efficacy analysis population; long-term relative effectiveness of darolutamide; price discount on subsequent therapies. We identified resource use patterns for comparator and subsequent therapies as a quantifiable, yet non-significant source of uncertainty. The EQ-5D value set used to estimate utility values was identified as a non-quantifiable and potentially not significant source of uncertainty.  Conclusions:   The procedural framework, demonstrated with an example, was sufficiently flexible and coherent to document and structure the sources of uncertainty in cost-effectiveness analyses.

For CPS, we used Nickel's criteria, which were used previously to estimate the prevalence of CP and are based on the NIH Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index. To test the robustness of Nickel's criteria, we used two other definitions of CPS (two sensitivity analyses). We measured QOL with the Short-Form 12-Item Health Survey. We compared the participants' QOL scores with the national-norm scores, and with the scores of men who had benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).  Results:   Among the 5 010 participants, 1.4% had DCP and 3.7% had CPS. The sensitivity analyses resulted in CPS prevalence estimates of 3.1% and 4.5%. CPS was particularly common in younger participants (5.7% of those in their 30 s had CPS). QOL was very low among men with CP: In most areas (domains) of QOL, their scores were more than 0.5 standard deviation below the national-norm mean. Their mental-health scores were lower than those of men with BPH. The lowest scores among all 8 QOL domains were in role-functioning.  Conclusions:   CP is common, but it is underdiagnosed, particularly in younger men. Whether diagnosed or only suspected, CP's impact on QOL is large. Because CP is common, and because it substantially impairs individuals' QOL and can also reduce societal productivity, it requires more attention.

Secondary endpoints were patterns of failure, high-grade treatment toxic effects (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0), and freedom from systemic therapy. The threshold dose per fraction considered ablative was 8 Gy.  Results:   A total of 401 patients with 530 treated oligometastases were included, with a median follow-up of 3 years. Three hundred and two and 99 patients had metachronous and synchronous presentations of oligometastatic disease, respectively. Common histologies included prostate (24%), lung (18%), gastrointestinal (19%), and breast (11%). More than 90% of doses delivered were Biologically Effective Dose [BED10]≥60 Gy. Cumulative incidence at 5 years of local-only failure was 6%, local and distant 2%, and distant-only 58%. The 3- and 5-year OS [95% confidence intervals {CIs}] were 68% [62-73] and 54% [47-61], and PFS was 20% [15-25] and 14% [10-20]. The 3- and 5-year freedom from systemic therapy [95% CIs] were 40% [34-46] and 31% [24-37], respectively. Seventy-six patients were inoperable and 325 were operable. Operability status was not prognostic for OS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.7; P = .9) or for PFS (adjusted HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.6; P = .5). Total metastatic ablation was prognostic for OS (adjusted HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9; P = .032) and for PFS (adjusted HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.8; P = .003).  Conclusions:   Medical operability was not prognostic in patients with oligometastatic disease treated with SABR. Total metastatic ablation was associated with superior OS and PFS compared with subtotal metastatic ablation. Our data support ablation of all sites of oligometastases wherever feasible.""","""['Shankar Siva', 'Gavin Jones', 'Mathias Bressel', 'Mark Shaw', 'Sarat Chander', 'Julie Chu', 'Nikki Plumridge', 'Keelan Byrne', 'Gargi Kothari', 'Nicholas Hardcastle', 'Mathieu Gaudreault', 'Tomas Kron', 'Greg Wheeler', 'Michael MacManus', 'Gerard G Hanna', 'David L Ball', 'Steven David']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Effectiveness of Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy for Systemic Therapy Respondents with Inoperable Pulmonary Oligometastases and Oligoprogression.', 'Long-term outcomes in radically treated synchronous vs. metachronous oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Systemic treatment with or without ablative therapies in oligometastatic breast cancer: A single institution analysis of patient outcomes.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'An individual patient data metaanalysis of outcomes and prognostic factors after treatment of oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Top Ten Lessons Learned from Trials in Oligometastatic Cancers.']"""

Objectives:   The present study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, prevalence, and clinical outcomes of the most common cardiovascular ED admissions in patients with cancer.  Methods:   All ED encounters with a primary CVD diagnosis from the US Nationwide Emergency Department Sample between January 2016 to December 2018 were stratified by cancer type as well as metastatic status. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to determine the adjusted odds ratios of in-hospital mortality in different groups.  Results:   From a total of 20,737,247 ED encounters with a primary CVD diagnosis, cancer was present in 3.4%. In patients with cancer the most common CVDs were DVT/PE (20%), hypertensive heart or kidney disease (14.7%), and AF/flutter (11.2%). The distribution of CVDs varied by cancer type, with AF/flutter most common in patients with lung cancer, AMI most common in patients with prostate cancer, heart failure most common in those with haematological malignancies, and patients with colorectal cancer having the greatest frequency of DVT/PE. Cancer status was independently associated with significantly higher risk of mortality in almost all CVD categories, consistent across all the cancer types, amongst which lung cancer patients had the highest risk of mortality across all CVD categories, except intracranial haemorrhage and hypertensive crisis.  Conclusions:   Cardiovascular presentations to the ED varied by cancer subtype.

We have previously shown that upregulation of autophagy is one of the mechanisms by which prostate cancer (PC) cells survive APA anti-tumor treatment in vitro. Therefore, we investigated the characteristics of the autophagic response to APA treatment, alone and in combination with autophagy inhibition, in an in vivo model.  Methods:   Tumor cells were injected into previously castrated nude mice. Four groups of mice bearing LNCaP xenografts were treated with daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of vehicle (control), APA (10 mg/kg), APA (10 mg/kg) + Chl (Chloroquine, 10 mg/kg) or Chl (10 mg/kg). The animals of each treatment group (3/treatment) were kept for the duration of 2 and 3 weeks. At the end of the experiments, the animals were sacrificed and all samples assessed for tumor weight and size, histological analysis, immunoblotting (WES) and immunofluorescence.  Results:   The tumor weight was significantly reduced in mice treated with APA + Chl (203.2 ± 5.0, SEM, P = 0.0066) compared to vehicle control (380.4 ± 37.0). Importantly, the combined treatment showed a higher impact on tumor weight than APA (320.4 ± 45.5) or Chl (337.9 ± 35) alone. The mice treated with the combination of APA + Chl exhibited a reduced expression of ATG5 (autophagy-related five protein), Beclin 1 and LC3 punctuations and an increase in P62 as visualized by immunofluorescence and WES. In addition, Ki-67 nuclear staining was detected in all samples however reduced in APA + Chl (58%) compared to vehicle control (100%). The reduction in Ki-67 protein was associated with an increase in caspase 3 and endothelial CD31 protein expression.  Conclusion:   These data demonstrate that a treatment with APA + Chl leads to reduced autophagy levels and to tumor suppression compared to the APA monotherapy. Hence, the increased antitumor effect of APA in combination with autophagy inhibitors might provide a new therapeutic approach potentially translatable to patients.""","""['Daniel Eberli#', 'Benedikt Kranzbühler#', 'Lukas Prause', 'Valentin Baumgartner', 'Sheryl Preda', 'Rosa Sousa', 'Fabienne Lehner', 'Souzan Salemi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Apalutamide in combination with autophagy inhibitors improves treatment effects in prostate cancer cells.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Autophagy inhibition improves the chemotherapeutic efficacy of cruciferous vegetable-derived diindolymethane in a murine prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'Combination of Quercetin and 2-Methoxyestradiol Enhances Inhibition of Human Prostate Cancer LNCaP and PC-3 Cells Xenograft Tumor Growth.', 'Antitumor activity of chloroquine in combination with Cisplatin in human gastric cancer xenografts.']"""

The 2018 Faculty of Radiation Oncology of the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists (RANZCR) position statement recommends that patients have the opportunity to discuss all suitable treatment options, ideally with the relevant specialist. This study aimed to determine the number and characteristics of men referred to radiation oncology before undergoing radical prostatectomy in the years immediately preceding the 2018 RANZCR position statement.  Methods:   The electronic records of all men who underwent a radical prostatectomy in the Auckland region between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed for documentation of a referral or offer of referral to radiation oncology, or multidisciplinary meeting (MDM) consensus for surgery before prostatectomy. Patient and tumour variables were collected.  Results:   Between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2017, 234 patients underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in the wider Auckland region. Before undergoing prostatectomy, 89 of 234 patients (38.0%) were referred, offered but declined referral, or had MDM consensus for surgery. Age and urologist were most strongly correlated with the primary outcome; those offered referral were older than those who were not (P = 0.030). The practice of one urologist was an outlier, referring or recommending referral to 92.3% of patients (P < 0.0001).

Thus, we present the first in vitro redox adaptation model for metastatic prostate cancer (mPC), LNCaP-hydrogen peroxide resistant (LNCaP-HPR), with enhanced oxidative stress resistance accompanying poor Cabazitaxel response. After establishing, the cells were characterized by comparing the viability, death, oxidative stress, total glutathione (GSH) levels and the mRNA and protein levels of the redox-sensitive transcription factors responsible for the adaptation, Nrf-2, NF-κB and HIF-1α. Then, the apoptotic effect of Cabazitaxel was evaluated in LNCaP mPC, LNCaP-HPR and C4-2 metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC) cells. In response to H2 O2 , viability, oxidative stress and the total GSH levels of LNCaP-HPR cells have confirmed the oxidative stress resistance. Nrf-2, NF-κB and HIF-1α were upregulated in LNCaP-HPR cells, not in LNCaP, confirming that resistant cells were much less affected by exogenous oxidative stress. Unlike LNCaP, LNCaP-HPR cells were less sensitive to Cabazitaxel, as closer to the response of C4-2 mCRPC cells, indicating that redox adaptation decreased Cabazitaxel response.

Design, setting, and participants:   TALAPRO-1 is a single-arm, phase 2 study in men with mCRPC DDR alterations either directly or indirectly involved in HRR, who previously received one to two taxane-based chemotherapy regimens for advanced prostate cancer and whose mCRPC progressed on one or more novel hormonal agents.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Men completed the European Quality-of-life Five-dimension Five-level scale (EQ-5D-5L), EQ-5D visual analog scale (VAS), and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form at predefined time points during the study. The patient-reported outcome (PRO) population included men who completed a baseline and one or more postbaseline assessments before study end. Longitudinal mixed-effect models assuming an unstructured covariance matrix were used to estimate the mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) change from baseline for pain and general health status measurements among all patients and patients with BRCA1/2 mutations.  Results and limitations:   In the 97 men in the PRO population treated with talazoparib (BRCA1/2, n = 56), the mean (95% CI) EQ-5D-5L Index improved (all patients, 0.05 [0.01, 0.08]; BRCA1/2 subset, 0.07 [0.03, 0.10]), as did the EQ-5D VAS scores (all patients, 5.42 [2.65, 8.18]; BRCA1/2 subset, 4.74 [1.07, 8.41]).

The differential risk of SREs among patients receiving abiraterone acetate (AA) or enzalutamide (ENZ) is unknown.  Methods:   To compare the risk of SREs among men with mCRPC receiving AA or ENZ, a retrospective cohort study using the SEER-Medicare Linked Database was conducted. Men with prostate cancer aged ≥65 years at first AA or ENZ prescription (index date) from 2011 to 2015 were identified. Patients were followed until the earliest occurrence of SRE, death, Medicare disenrollment, or December 31, 2016. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of SRE (pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, or surgery or radiation to bone) after the index date. Multivariable logistic regressions including key demographic and clinical covariates with death as a competing risk were conducted.  Results:   Overall, 5,856 patients were identified (4,207 received AA and 1,649 received ENZ). Median age was 76.5 years (IQR 71.4-82.3), 4,557 (77.8%) were White, 1,112 (19.2%) had recent chemotherapy, and 2,730 (46.6%) had recent zoledronic acid or denosumab. Eight-hundred and thirty-seven (14.3%) patients had ≥1 SRE after index date. In multivariable analyses, there was no difference in SRE risk based on AA and ENZ (HR=0.99 for ENZ, 95%CI 0.84-1.16, P=0.890). Denosumab was associated with lower SRE risk (HR=0.75, 95%CI 0.64-0.88, P=0.001).  Conclusions:   In this large cohort of men with mCRPC, there was no difference in risk of SRE between AA and ENZ. Decision-making should be informed by prior therapies, comorbidities, toxicity profiles, and patient preferences.

The aim of this study is to report the impact of the comorbidity on clinical outcome, function, and failure of an allograft kidney.  Methods:   This case-control study included 101 KT patients. Twenty-six patients who developed cancer (CA) were assigned to the case group and 75 to the control group. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression models, and graft survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier curve.  Results:   Non-melanoma skin CA was the most common malignancy, accounting for almost 60% of cases, followed by stomach CA, prostate CA, and lymphoproliferative diseases (7.70% each). Difference in graft and patient survival was not significant between the two groups (P > .05). A tumor in nonfunctioning in the first nonfunctioning KT was identified in 1 KT patient with a second allograft and by anatomopathological was detect Fuhrman grade II renal cell carcinoma. This KT patient was in good clinical condition with serum creatinine level of 1.5 mg/dL.  Conclusions:   No association was observed between CA development and risk factors, including family history and smoking habit, and no differences in allograft and patient survival were found. Nevertheless, in our data, CA in KT patients occurred early after transplantation.

Design:   12-month, two-arm, randomised controlled trial.  Setting:   University clinical exercise centre.  Participants:   70 ADT-treated men were randomised to exercise-training plus supplementation (Ex+ Suppl, n=34) or usual care (control, n=36).  Intervention:   Men allocated to Ex + Suppl undertook thrice weekly resistance training with weight-bearing exercise training plus daily whey protein (25 g), calcium (1200 mg) and vitamin D (2000 IU) supplementation.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   Cognition was assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months via a computerised battery (CogState), Trail-making test, Rey auditory-verbal learning test and Digit span. Data were analysed with linear mixed models and an intention-to-treat and prespecified per-protocol approach (exercise-training: ≥66%, nutritional supplement: ≥80%).  Results:   Sixty (86%) men completed the trial (Ex + Suppl, n=31; control, n=29). Five (7.1%) men were classified as having mild cognitive impairment at baseline.

Recent studies have highlighted its expression also in solid tumors, including prostate cancer (PCa), and have described its role primarily in the proinflammatory response and induction of apoptosis. It is up-regulated in some castration-resistant prostate cancers. However, the role of TLR3 in prostate cancer progression remains largely unknown. The current study experimentally demonstrated that exogenous TLR3 activation in PCa cell lines leads to a significant induction of secretion of the cytokines IL-6, IL-8, and interferon-β, depending on the model and chemoresistance status. Transcriptomic analysis of TLR3-overexpressing cells revealed a functional program that is enriched for genes involved in the regulation of cell motility, migration, and tumor invasiveness. Increased motility, migration, and invasion in TLR3-overexpressing cell line were confirmed by several in vitro assays and using an orthotopic prostate xenograft model in vivo. Furthermore, TLR3-ligand induced apoptosis via cleavage of caspase-3/7 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase, predominantly in TLR3-overexpressing cells. These results indicate that TLR3 may be involved in prostate cancer progression and metastasis; however, it might also represent an Achilles heel of PCa, which can be exploited for targeted therapy.""","""['Ximena M Muresan', 'Eva Slabáková', 'Jiřina Procházková', 'Stanislav Drápela', 'Radek Fedr', 'Markéta Pícková', 'Ondřej Vacek', 'Ráchel Víchová', 'Tereza Suchánková', 'Jan Bouchal', 'Daniela Kürfürstová', 'Milan Král', 'Tereza Hulínová', 'Radek P Sýkora', 'Vladimír Študent', 'Václav Hejret', 'Wytske M van Weerden', 'Martin Puhr', 'Václav Pustka', 'David Potěšil', 'Zbyněk Zdráhal', 'Zoran Culig', 'Karel Souček']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['Transfected poly(I:C) activates different dsRNA receptors, leading to apoptosis or immunoadjuvant response in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells.', 'Toll-like receptor 3 triggers apoptosis of human prostate cancer cells through a PKC-alpha-dependent mechanism.', 'Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) activation induces microRNA-dependent reexpression of functional RARβ and tumor regression.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'Exploiting poly(I:C) to induce cancer cell apoptosis.', 'Dialog beyond the Grave: Necrosis in the Tumor Microenvironment and Its Contribution to Tumor Growth.']"""

We analysed if short- and mid-term genome-wide responses to shifts in RNA polymerase (RNAP) concentration are influenced by the known topology and logic of the transcription factor network (TFN) of Escherichia coli. We found that, at the gene cohort level, the magnitude of the single-gene, mid-term transcriptional responses to changes in RNAP concentration can be explained by the absolute difference between the gene's numbers of activating and repressing input transcription factors (TFs).

Purpose:   To evaluate safety, functional, and early-stage oncological outcomes for patients with gold fiducial markers undergoing salvage magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation (sTULSA) for radiorecurrent PCa.  Material and methods:   Data were acquired from an ethics-approved, single-center phase-1 study. Eight patients with 18 total gold fiducial markers inside the planned treatment volume were identified. MRI controls were performed at three and 12 months, followed by PSMA-PET-CT imaging and biopsies at 12 months. A control cohort of 13 patients who underwent sTULSA without markers were also identified for safety profile comparison. Adverse events were reported using the Clavien-Dindo classification, and questionnaires including EPIC-26, IPSS, and IIEF-5 were collected.  Results:   Of 18 markers, 2 (11%) were directly responsible for poor ultrasound penetration. However, there were no local recurrences at 12 months. PSA, prostate volume, and non-perfused volume all decreased over time. At 12 months, 11/18 (61%) of fiducial markers had disappeared via sloughing.

We sought to describe prescreening PSA (prostate-specific antigen) counseling (PPC) rates amongst male-to-female transgender (MtF-TG) patients and non-TG patients using the behavioral risk factor surveillance system (BRFSS).  Methods:   We used the survey data from 2014, 2016, and 2018 BRFSS and included respondents aged 40-79 years who completed the ""PCa screening"" and ""sexual orientation and gender identity"" modules. We analyzed differences in age, education level, income level, marital status, and race/ethnicity using Pearson's χ2 tests. The association of PPC with MtF-TG status and other patient characteristics was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   A total of 175,383 respondents were included, of which 0.3% identified as MtF-TG. Overall, 62.4% of respondents reported undergoing PPC. On univariate analysis, PPC rates were lower among MtF-TG respondents when compared to the non-TG group (58.3% vs. 62.4%, p = 0.03). MtF-TG respondents were also more likely to report lower education level (p < 0.01), lower-income level (p < 0.01), and were less likely to be white (p < 0.01) than non-TG respondents. However, multivariate analysis adjusting for these respondent features demonstrated an association between higher income and higher education levels with increased odds of PPC, but no association was demonstrated between MtF-TG status and PPC rates. PPC rates for the MtF-TG and non-TG populations did not change significantly over time.  Conclusions:   Although PPC was less frequently reported among MtF-TG respondents than in the non-TG group on univariate analysis, this association was not demonstrated when controlling for confounders, including education and income levels. Instead, on multivariate analysis, low education and income levels were more predictive of PPC rates.

Furthermore, differences in PCa treatment and outcomes among Black men of different ethnic origins have also been identified. Due to the heterogeneity of PCa-impacted communities and the unclear impact of patient immigration status on treatment outcomes, we sought to determine the demographic factors associated with treatment choice for definitive treatment of PCa in our single institution's patient population of Black immigrants.  Methods:   We distributed surveys to all patients in the Kings County Hospital Center urologic oncology clinic from February 2019 to February 2020 and collected relevant health information via EMR. The survey collected demographic information regarding age, education, health insurance, employment status, socioeconomic status, country of birth, and years living in the United States (US).  Results:   Out of the 253 patients surveyed, the majority of patients surveyed were Black and foreign born. There were no significant differences in demographic data between US-born and foreign-born patients except number of years living in the United States. In the intermediate risk group, patients living in the United States for <10 years chose surgery significantly more often than US-born patients (90.9% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.036). On multivariate analysis, patients that chose surgery were more likely to be older when diagnosed (odds ratio [OR] = 1.21) and less likely to be born in the United States than in African or Caribbean countries (OR = 0.054).  Conclusions:   In our study of a majority-Black population, we found that patients born in the United States were less likely than their foreign counterparts to opt for surgery, as previous studies have shown.

Physical activity and alcohol use are positively associated in adults and cancer survivors but associations between physical activity and alcohol use in rural cancer survivors is unknown. This cross-sectional study explored associations between physical activity, sitting time, and alcohol use in rural cancer survivors.  Methods:   Cancer survivors residing in central Pennsylvania were recruited to the Partnering to Prevent and Control Cancer (PPCC) study and completed mailed questionnaires assessing physical activity (low, moderate, high), sitting time (<6 or ≥6 hours/day), and alcohol use (0 or ≥1 drinks/week). Binary logistic regression models tested associations between physical activity, sitting time, and alcohol use, adjusting for age, gender, and education.  Results:   Participants (N=219) were in their mid-60s (M age=64.5 ± 12.2 years, 60.7% female), overweight (M BMI=29.6 ± 6.9 kg/m2), and 50.5% were college graduates. Nearly half of participants were breast (22.8%) or prostate (20.5%) cancer survivors and 90.4% were >12 weeks but <5 years post-treatment. Participants self-reported meeting physical activity recommendations (79.5%), sitting <6 hours/day (53.3%), and consuming ≥1 alcoholic drinks/week (54.1%). Participants who reported being moderately (OR=5.0, 95% CI: 1.9-12.9) or highly (OR=4.5, 95% CI: 1.9-10.9) active had higher odds of reporting alcohol use, after adjusting for covariates.

PT-112 also associates with bone (osteotropism), likely driven by its pyrophosphate moiety. This is the first-in-human study of PT-112 monotherapy, exploring its safety and efficacy in a patient population where standard of care therapies were exhausted and novel treatment options are needed.  Methods:   Patients with progressing, advanced solid tumours received PT-112 intravenously (1 h) on days 1, 8, 15 of a 28-day cycle in an open-label, multi-centre 3 + 3 dose-escalation trial, conducted at four US research sites. The primary objective was to assess safety and pharmacokinetics, and to identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). Eligibility criteria included: age ≥18 years, Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-1, and disease evaluable by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1·1 or by informative tumour markers. Patients receiving ≥1 dose of PT-112 were included in the safety and pharmacokinetic analyses, with the exploratory efficacy analysis including patients receiving ≥1 dose at 125 mg/m2. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02266745, with the dose-escalation portion of the study closed.  Findings:   Between July 7th, 2014 and September 18th, 2018, 66 heavily pre-treated patients (median 4 prior lines, IQR 2-6) were enrolled and treated across 11 doses (12-420 mg/m2). Treatment-related adverse events included fatigue (23 patients, 35%), nausea (16 patients, 24%), and peripheral neuropathy (14 patients, 21%). Grade 3 events were experienced by 18 patients (27%), with no grade 4-5 events observed. The recommended phase 2 dose was determined to be 360 mg/m2. Nine (17%) of the 54 efficacy evaluable patients achieved progression-free survival ≥6 months. Durable partial responses were induced in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and thymoma. Radiographic and serum marker reductions were observed among ten patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, four of whom survived two years or longer.  Interpretation:   PT-112 is safe and well-tolerated in a heavily pre-treated population. Prolonged responses were noted against thymoma and lung cancer, along with radiographic and serum marker improvement in prostate cancer. Given the heterogeneous patient population, subsequent studies will be needed to characterize the risk/benefit ratio in more homogenous settings.

Comparisons were made by evaluating times and costs of the radiolabeling process, imaging features including pharmacokinetics, and impact on patient management. The analysis of advantages and drawbacks of both radioligands might help to make a better choice based on firm data. For [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, the radiochemical yield (RCY) using a low starting activity (L, average activity of 596.55 ± 37.97 MBq) was of 80.98 ± 0.05%, while using a high one (H, average activity of 1436.27 ± 68.68 MBq), the RCY was 71.48 ± 0.04%. Thus, increased starting activities of [68Ga]-chloride negatively influenced the RCY. A similar scenario occurred for [18F]PSMA-1007. The rate of detection of PCa lesions by Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) was similar for both radioligands, while their distribution in normal organs significantly differed. Furthermore, similar patterns of biodistribution were found among [18F]PSMA-1007, [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, the most used agent for RLT.

Moreover, the same compounds were subjected to systematic in silico screening for the identification of target proteins such as human adenosine kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and human mitogen-activated protein kinase 1. The compounds showed promising results in cytotoxicity assays; among the tested compounds, 2c showed the most potent cytotoxic activity in the liver cancer cell line Hep G-2, with an IC50 of 3.29 ± 0.15 µM, whereas the standard drug IC50 was 4.68 ± 0.17 µM. In the prostate cancer cell line DU-145, the compounds displayed IC50 ranges of 15.42 ± 0.16 to 41.34 ± 0.12 µM, while the standard drug had an IC50 of 21.96 ± 0.15 µM. In terms of structural insights, the halogenated phenyl substitution on the second position of benzothiazepine was found to significantly improve the biological activity. This characteristic feature is supported by the binding patterns on the selected target proteins in docking simulations.

We investigated the effects of ONG41008 on tumor cells and compared these effects with those in pathogenic myofibroblasts. Stimulation of A549 (lung carcinoma epithelial cells) or PANC1 (pancreatic ductal carcinoma cells) with ONG41008 resulted in robust cellular senescence, indicating that dysregulated cell proliferation is common to fibrotic cells and tumor cells. The senescence was followed by multinucleation, a manifestation of mitotic slippage. There was significant upregulation of expression and rapid nuclear translocation of p-TP53 and p16 in the treated cancer cells, which thereafter died after 72 h confirmed by 6 day live imaging. ONG41008 exhibited a comparable senogenic potential to that of dasatinib. Interestingly, ONG41008 was only able to activate caspase-3, 7 in comparison with quercetin and fisetin, also containing CS in PANC1. ONG41008 did not seem to be essentially toxic to normal human lung fibroblasts or primary prostate epithelial cells, suggesting ONG41008 can distinguish the intracellular microenvironment between normal cells and aged or diseased cells. This effect might occur as a result of the increased NAD/NADH ratio, because ONG41008 restored this important metabolic ratio in cancer cells. Taken together, this is the first study to demonstrate that a small molecule can arrest uncontrolled proliferation during fibrogenesis or tumorigenesis via both senogenic and senolytic potential.

However, data from the literature are somewhat contradictory regarding the precise role of TRPM8 in prostatic carcinogenesis and are mostly based on in vitro studies. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role played by TRPM8 in PCa progression. We used a prostate orthotopic xenograft mouse model to show that TRPM8 overexpression dramatically limited tumor growth and metastasis dissemination in vivo. Mechanistically, our in vitro data revealed that TRPM8 inhibited tumor growth by affecting the cell proliferation and clonogenic properties of PCa cells. Moreover, TRPM8 impacted metastatic dissemination mainly by impairing cytoskeleton dynamics and focal adhesion formation through the inhibition of the Cdc42, Rac1, ERK, and FAK pathways. Lastly, we proved the in vivo efficiency of a new tool based on lipid nanocapsules containing WS12 in limiting the TRPM8-positive cells' dissemination at metastatic sites.

The in vitro proliferation, migration, and invasion of cells were measured by a cell proliferation assay, colony formation, wound healing, and Transwell assays, respectively. In vivo tumor growth was analyzed by transplantation into nude mice. The inhibition of NAT10 by Remodelin not only suppressed growth, migration, and invasion in vitro, but also the in vivo cancer growth of prostate cancer cells. The involvement of NAT10 in DNA replication was assessed by EdU labeling, DNA spreading, iPOND, and ChIP-PCR assays. The inhibition of NAT10 by Remodelin slowed DNA replication. NAT10 was detected in the prereplication complex, and it could also bind to DNA replication origins. Furthermore, the interaction between NAT10 and CDC6 was analyzed by Co-IP. The altered expression of NAT10 was measured by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. Remodelin markedly reduced the levels of CDC6 and AR. The expression of NAT10 could be altered under either castration or noncastration conditions, and Remodelin still suppressed the growth of in vitro-induced castration-resistant prostate cancers. The analysis of a TCGA database revealed that the overexpression of NAT10, CDC6, and MCM7 in prostate cancers were correlated with the Gleason score and node metastasis. Our data demonstrated that Remodelin, an inhibitor of NAT10, effectively inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells under either no castration or castration conditions, likely by impairing DNA replication.""","""['Ningning Ma', 'Haijing Liu', 'Yaqian Wu', 'Mengfei Yao', 'Bo Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Remodelin, a N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10) inhibitor, alters mitochondrial lipid metabolism in cancer cells.', 'Acetyltransferase NAT10 regulates the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway to promote colorectal cancer progression via ac4C acetylation of KIF23 mRNA.', 'Remodelin, an inhibitor of NAT10, could suppress hypoxia-induced or constitutional expression of HIFs in cells.', 'Overexpression of NAT10 induced platinum drugs resistance in breast cancer cell.', 'Mechanisms of NAT10 as ac4C writer in diseases.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'NAT10 mediated mRNA acetylation modification patterns associated with colon cancer progression and microsatellite status.']"""

The sieves were made by a laser ablation process. The graphene oxide (GO) deposition process was characterized by the complete covering of the inner edges of the microholes and the flat surface between the holes with GO. Electron microscanning studies have shown that due to the deposition method applied, graphene oxide flakes line the interior of the microholes, reducing the unevenness of the downstream surfaces during the laser ablation process. The presence of graphene oxide was confirmed by Fourier infrared spectroscopy. During the screening (sieving) process, the microsieves were placed in a sieve column. Gold foil is proven to be a very good material for the screening of cancer cells, but even more so after screening as a substrate for re-culture of the DU 145. This allows a potential recovery of the cells and the development of a targeted therapy. The sieved cells were successfully grown on the microsieves used in the experiment.

Upregulation of the non-canonical redox-sensitive NF-kB family member, RelB, confers radioresistance in prostate cancer (PCa). We screened FDA-approved compounds and identified betamethasone (BET) as a drug that increases hydrogen peroxide levels in vitro and protects non-PCa tissues/cells while also enhancing radiation killing of PCa tissues/cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Significantly, BET increases ROS levels and exerts different effects on RelB expression in normal cells and PCa cells. BET induces protein expression of RelB and RelB target genes, including the primary antioxidant enzyme, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), in normal cells, while it suppresses protein expression of RelB and MnSOD in LNCaP cells and PC3 cells. RNA sequencing analysis identifies B-cell linker protein (BLNK) as a novel RelB complementary partner that BET differentially regulates in normal cells and PCa cells. RelB and BLNK are upregulated and correlate with the aggressiveness of PCa in human samples. The RelB-BLNK axis translocates to the nuclear compartment to activate MnSOD protein expression. BET promotes the RelB-BLNK axis in normal cells but suppresses the RelB-BLNK axis in PCa cells. Targeted disruptions of RelB-BLNK expressions mitigate the radioprotective effect of BET on normal cells and the radiosensitizing effect of BET on PCa cells.

Eighty-four genetic variants associated with prostate cancer susceptibility were selected from the literature through genome association studies (GWAS). Allele frequencies were obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project, and epidemiological data were obtained from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER). The PCa incidence, mortality rates, and allele frequencies of variants were evaluated by Pearson's correlation.

Moreover, while CAMKK2 is known to regulate systemic metabolism, whether CAMKK2's effects on whole-body metabolism would impact prostate cancer progression and/or related comorbidities is not known. Here, we demonstrate that germline ablation of Camkk2 slows, but does not stop, primary prostate tumorigenesis in the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) genetic mouse model. Consistent with prior epidemiological reports supporting a link between obesity and prostate cancer aggressiveness, TRAMP mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited a pronounced increase in the colonization of lung metastases. We demonstrated that this effect on the metastatic spread was dependent on CAMKK2. Notably, diet-induced lung metastases exhibited a highly aggressive neuroendocrine phenotype. Concurrently, Camkk2 deletion improved insulin sensitivity in the same mice. Histological analyses revealed that cancer cells were smaller in the TRAMP;Camkk2-/- mice compared to TRAMP;Camkk2+/+ controls. Given the differences in circulating insulin levels, a known regulator of cell growth, we hypothesized that systemic CAMKK2 could promote prostate cancer cell growth and disease progression in part through cancer cell-extrinsic mechanisms. Accordingly, host deletion of Camkk2 impaired the growth of syngeneic murine prostate tumors in vivo, confirming nonautonomous roles for CAMKK2 in prostate cancer. Cancer cell size and mTOR signaling was diminished in tumors propagated in Camkk2-null mice. Together, these data indicate that, in addition to cancer cell-intrinsic roles, CAMKK2 mediates prostate cancer progression via tumor-extrinsic mechanisms.

Here, we studied a novel drug conjugate, ZHER3-ABD-mcDM1, consisting of a HER3-targeting affibody molecule, coupled to the cytotoxic tubulin polymerization inhibitor DM1, and an albumin-binding domain for in vivo half-life extension. ZHER3-ABD-mcDM1 showed a strong affinity to the extracellular domain of HER3 (KD 6 nM), and an even stronger affinity (KD 0.2 nM) to the HER3-overexpressing pancreatic carcinoma cell line, BxPC-3. The drug conjugate showed a potent cytotoxic effect on BxPC-3 cells with an IC50 value of 7 nM. Evaluation of a radiolabeled version, [99mTc]Tc-ZHER3-ABD-mcDM1, showed a relatively high rate of internalization, with a 27% internalized fraction after 8 h. Further in vivo evaluation showed that it could target BxPC-3 (pancreatic carcinoma) and DU145 (prostate carcinoma) xenografts in mice, with an uptake peaking at 6.3 ± 0.4% IA/g at 6 h post-injection for the BxPC-3 xenografts. The general biodistribution showed uptake in the liver, lung, salivary gland, stomach, and small intestine, organs known to express murine ErbB3 naturally.

Our aim was to report long-term urological complications after a conservative approach combining conservative surgery and brachytherapy.  Patients and methods:   Eighty-six patients, free of disease, were retrospectively reviewed. Symptoms related to urinary tract obstruction, incontinence, infection, and lithiasis were reported and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) classification. Only symptomatic patients underwent urodynamic studies. Risk factors for complications were analyzed.  Results:   There were 76 males and 10 females. The median follow-up was 6.3 years (18 months to 24 years). Complications occurred after a median follow-up of 5 years (0-21). Twenty-two patients (26%) had long-term urological complications. Urinary tract obstruction was found in 15 patients (17%) and urinary incontinence in 14 patients (16%). Recurrent urinary tract infection occurred in four patients and urinary lithiasis in four (5%). The underlying physiopathology included bladder dysfunction in 15 patients (17%), urethral stenosis in six (7%), and ureterovesical junction stenosis in five (6%). On univariate analysis, posterior bladder wall dissection (p = .001), bladder neck trigone dissection (p = .010), and partial prostatectomy (p = .023) were significantly associated with an increased risk of bladder dysfunction; on multivariate analysis, only age ≤2 years (p = .028) at operation and posterior bladder wall dissection (p = .006) were found to be significant.  Conclusion:   The conservative surgical approach combined with brachytherapy for bladder-prostate RMS leads to long-term urological complications in 26% of survivors. Optimizing brachytherapy doses for young children and establishing a clear and long-term follow-up protocol could help to reduce these complications.""","""['Rezkalla Akkary', 'Florent Guérin', 'Cyrus Chargari', 'Loic Jochault', 'Georges Audry', 'Luca Pio', 'Veronique Minard-Colin', 'Christine Haie-Meder', 'Hélène Martelli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pediatr Blood Cancer""","""['Brachytherapy Combined With Surgery for Conservative Treatment of Children With Bladder Neck and/or Prostate Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Conservative surgery plus brachytherapy treatment for boys with prostate and/or bladder neck rhabdomyosarcoma: a single team experience.', 'Bladder function after conservative surgery and high-dose rate brachytherapy for bladder-prostate rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Current treatment of pediatric bladder and prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (bladder preserving vs. radical cystectomy).', 'Brachytherapy role in pediatric rhabdomyosarcomas.', 'Increasing Patient Safety and Treatment Quality by Using Intraoperative MRI for Organ-Preserving Tumor Resection and High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy in Children with Bladder/Prostate and Perianal Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Clinical Characteristics, Treatment Considerations, and Outcomes of Infants with Rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'Developments in the Surgical Approach to Staging and Resection of Rhabdomyosarcoma.']"""

Included are 66 men with anemia (hemoglobin < 130 g/L). The follow-up time was up to 16 years, and the main results are that anemia is associated with all fractures and non-vertebral osteoporotic fractures.  Introduction:   Anemia and osteoporotic fractures are conditions that are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinical studies have suggested that anemia can be used as a predictor of future osteoporotic fractures.  Method:   Men from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men Study (MrOS) Sweden, Gothenburg, with available hemoglobin (Hb) values (n = 1005, median age 75.3 years (SD 3.2)), were included in the current analyses. Of these, 66 suffered from anemia, defined as Hb < 130 g/L. Median follow-up time for fracture was 10.1 years and the longest follow-up time was 16.1 years.  Results:   Men with anemia had, at baseline, experienced more falls and had a higher prevalence of diabetes, cancer, prostate cancer, hypertension, and stroke. Anemia was not statistically significantly associated with bone mineral density (BMD). Men with anemia had higher serum levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (iFGF23) (p < 0.001) and phosphate (p = 0.001) and lower serum levels of testosterone (p < 0.001) and estradiol (p < 0.001). Moreover, men with anemia had an increased risk of any fracture (hazard ratio (HR) 1.97, 95% CI 1.28-3.02) and non-vertebral osteoporotic fracture (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.18-3.93), after adjustment for age and total hip BMD, in 10 years. The risk for any fracture was increased in 10 and 16 years independently of falls, comorbidities, inflammation, and sex hormones. The age-adjusted risk of hip fracture was increased in men with anemia (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.06-5.12), in 10 years, although this was no longer statistically significant after further adjustment for total hip BMD.  Conclusions:   Anemia is associated with an increased risk for any fracture and non-vertebral osteoporotic fracture in elderly men with a long follow-up time.

This is a retrospective observational cohort of the Indiana State Department of Health Cancer Registry, and the Indiana Network for Patient Care. First time cancer diagnoses appearing in the registry between January 2013 and December 2017 were included. Cases identified as patients who had an ED visit in the 6 months before their cancer diagnosis; controls had no preceding ED visits. The primary outcome was mortality, comparing ED-associated mortality to non-ED-associated. 134,761 first-time cancer patients were identified, including 15,432 (11.5%) cases. The mean age was same at 65, more of the cases were Black than the controls (12.4% vs 7.4%, P < .0001) and more were low income (36.4%. vs 29.3%). The top 3 ED-associated cancer diagnoses were lung (18.4%), breast (8.9%), and colorectal cancers (8.9%), whereas the controls were breast (17%), lung (14.9%), and prostate cancers (10.1%). Cases observed an over three-fold higher mortality, with cumulative death rate of 32.9% for cases vs 9.0% for controls (P < .0001). Regression analysis predicting mortality, controlling for many confounders produced an odds ratio of 4.12 (95% CI 3.72-4.56 for cases). This study found that an ED visit within 6 months prior to the first time of ICD-coded cancer is associated with Black race, low income and an overall three-fold increased adjusted risk of death. The mortality rates for ED-associated cancers are uniformly worse for all cancer types. These data suggest that additional work is needed to reduce disparities among ED-associated cancer diagnoses.""","""['Nicholas Pettit', 'Elisa Sarmiento', 'Jeffrey Kline']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Worsened outcomes of newly diagnosed cancer in patients with recent emergency care visits: A retrospective cohort study of 3699 adults in a safety net health system.', 'Prior Frequent Emergency Department Use as a Predictor of Emergency Department Visits After a New Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Trends in Adult Cancer-Related Emergency Department Utilization: An Analysis of Data From the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample.', 'Cancer-related Emergency Department Visits: Comparing Characteristics and Outcomes.', 'Emergency department factors associated with survival after sudden cardiac arrest.', 'ASO Author Reflections: Potentially Avoidable and Prolonged Hospitalizations for Suspected Colon Cancer-Hospital Impact.', 'Potentially Avoidable Admissions and Prolonged Hospitalization in Patients with Suspected Colon Cancer.', ""Retrospective study of cancer patients' predictive factors of care in a large, Hungarian tertiary care centre."", 'Worsened outcomes of newly diagnosed cancer in patients with recent emergency care visits: A retrospective cohort study of 3699 adults in a safety net health system.', 'Reduced Survival Outcome After Receiving a New Cancer Diagnosis in the Emergency Department: Findings from a Hospital Network in Rural Eastern North Carolina.']"""

However, early treatment resistance is common. This LuPIN substudy aimed to determine the prognostic value of posttreatment quantitative PET for PSA progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. Methods: Fifty-six men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were enrolled in the LuPIN trial and received up to 6 doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and a radiation sensitizer (NOX66). 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-FDG PET/CT, diagnostic CT, and bone scanning were performed at study entry and exit. Quantitative analysis tracked change in total tumor volume (TTV) and SUV. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to examine the association of change in TTV (continuous and >30%), SUVmax, PSA, and radiographic progression with PSA PFS and OS. Results: All men (37/56) who underwent both screening and posttreatment molecular imaging were analyzed; 70% (26/37) had a PSA response of more than 50%. Median PSA PFS was 8.6 mo, and median OS was 22 mo. Clinical progression had occurred at trial exit in 54% (20/37). In response to treatment, a reduced PSMA SUVmax was demonstrated in 95% (35/37) and a reduced PSMA TTV in 68% (25/37). An increase in PSMA TTV by at least 30% was associated with worse OS (median, 10.2 vs. 23.6 mo; P = 0.002). Change in PSMA SUVmax was not associated with PSA PFS or OS. 18F-FDG SUVmax was reduced in 51% (18/35) and 18F-FDG TTV in 67% (22/35). An increased 18F-FDG SUVmax was associated with worse OS (median, 20.7 vs. 25.7 mo; P < 0.01). An 18F-FDG TTV increase by more than 30% was associated with a short PSA PFS (median, 3.5 vs. 8.6 mo; P < 0.001) but not OS. Both PSA and radiographic progression were associated with shorter OS (median, 14.5 vs. 25.7 mo [P < 0.001] and 12.2 vs. 23.6 mo [P = 0.002]). On multivariable analysis, only increased PSMA TTV and PSA progression remained independently prognostic of OS (hazard ratio, 5.1 [95% CI, 1.5-17.1; P = 0.008] and 3.5 [95% CI, 1.1-10.9; P = 0.03], respectively). Conclusion: Change in quantitative PSMA TTV has strong potential as a prognostic biomarker with 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy, independent of 18F-FDG PET parameters, PSA, or radiographic progression.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cell therapy has shown unprecedented clinical response in treating patients with hematological malignancies, and intense investigation is underway to achieve similar responses with solid tumors. Immunologically cold tumors, including prostate cancers, are often infiltrated with abundant tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and infiltration of CD163+ M2 macrophages correlates with tumor progression and poor responses to immunotherapy. However, the impact of TAMs on CAR T cell activity alone and in combination with TME immunomodulators is unclear.  Methods:   To model this in vitro, we utilized a novel co-culture system with tumor cells, CAR T cells, and polarized M1 or M2 macrophages from CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from healthy human donors. Tumor cell killing, T cell activation and proliferation, and macrophage phenotypes were evaluated by flow cytometry, cytokine production, RNA sequencing, and functional blockade of signaling pathways using antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. We also evaluated the TME in humanized mice following CAR T cell therapy for validation of our in vitro findings.  Results:   We observed inhibition of CAR T cell activity with the presence of M2 macrophages, but not M1 macrophages, coinciding with a robust induction of programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) in M2 macrophages. We observed similar PD-L1 expression in TAMs following CAR T cell therapy in the TME of humanized mice. PD-L1, but not programmed cell death protein-1, blockade in combination with CAR T cell therapy altered phenotypes to more M1-like subsets and led to loss of CD163+ M2 macrophages via interferon-γ signaling, resulting in improved antitumor activity of CAR T cells.

In the present study, we used a novel procedure for establishment of an experimental tibiabone metastasis mouse model, with human PC-3 prostate cancer expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP), that more closely matches prostate cancer growing in the bone.  Materials and methods:   PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, labeled with GFP, were initially subcutaneously injected into the flank of five male nude mice to obtain tumor tissues. Once the tumor tissue grew larger than 10 mm in diameter, the tumor tissue was harvested and minced into fragments of 1 mm3 A 1-mm hole was made in the proximal left tibia of eight male nude mice, using the tip of a 5-mm blade, and a tumor fragment was implanted into the hole for an exact fit. Tumor size was measured once a week, by non-invasive imaging of GFP fluorescence. The mice were sacrificed four weeks after tumor implantation.  Results:   Tumors grew in 8 out of 8 mice (100%). All tumors were non-invasively detectable with GFP fluorescence, through the skin. Increased tumor growth in the tibia was observed every week.

These plans underwent QA using the three-dimensional verification system. The datasets of another 30 cases without inserted errors were assessed as controls. The ROIs used in the evaluations were those used in our conventional method (planning target volume, rectum, and bladder). The isodose volume method (5%, 50% and 95% isodose volume) and the error detection rates (measurement above the tolerance values, as set from the other 30 cases) were assessed and compared.  Results:   There was significantly higher multileaf collimator systematic closed error detectability with the isodose volume method compared to the conventional method (A-side 0.2 mm: p=0.005, A-side 0.35 mm: p=0.002, B-side 0.2 mm: p=0.001 and B-side 0.35 mm: p=0.010). There were no error types for which the error detection rate of the isodose volume method was lower than that of the conventional method.

Forkhead box D1 (FOXD1) is a member of the FOX transcription factor family and has been reported to play an important role in the development and progression of various cancers. However, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains only partially understood. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effects on the associated regulatory signal pathway of FOXD1 in prostate cancer. To clarify the roles of FOXD1 in prostate cancer, we used siRNA to suppress its expression in 22Rv1 cells with relatively higher expression of FOXD1. The effects of FOXD1 silencing on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were determined. WST-1 assays were used to determine cell proliferation. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated through wound healing and transwell assays. The possible underlying mechanism of FOXD1 silencing on 22Rv1 was evaluated by determining the expression of proteins related to EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Our results showed that FOXD1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines -PC-3, DU145, LNCaP and 22Rv1- compared to normal prostate epithelial cell line RWPE-1. Additionally, silencing of FOXD1 significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion of 22Rv1 cells. Furthermore, silencing of FOXD1 decreased the expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1, which are involved in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. However, it did not appear to affect the expression of EMT-related proteins other than N-cadherin. Our results suggest that silencing of FOXD1 suppresses metastatic potentials of the PCa via N-cadherin - Wnt/β-catenin crosstalk. Therefore, the expression status of FOXD1 may be a new prognostic factor as well as a potential therapeutic target in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Cigdem Donmez', 'Ece Konac']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Gene""","""['Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'β-ionone Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in Prostate Cancer Cells by Negatively Regulating the Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway.', 'MicroRNA-506 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma through the inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by down-regulating LHX2.', 'Exploring the Wnt Pathway as a Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer.', 'The crossroads of adenosinergic pathway and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity in cancer.', 'FOX transcription factors are common regulators of Wnt/β-catenin-dependent gene transcription.']"""

It remains unknown if this holds true in biochemically recurrent disease after radical prostatectomy. Leveraging NRG/RTOG 9601, we aimed to determine the performance of intermediate clinical end points (ICEs) as surrogate end points for OS in recurrent prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   NRG/RTOG 9601 randomly assigned 760 men with recurrence after prostatectomy to salvage radiation therapy with 2 years of placebo versus bicalutamide 150 mg daily. ICEs assessed were biochemical failure (BF) per NRG/RTOG 9601 (prostate-specific antigen nadir + 0.3-0.5 ng/mL or initiation of salvage hormone therapy; [BF1]) and NRG/RTOG 0534 (prostate-specific antigen nadir+2 ng/mL; [BF2]), distant metastasis (DM), and MFS (DM or death). Surrogacy was assessed by the Prentice criteria and a two-stage meta-analytic approach (condition one assessed at the patient level with Kendall's τ and condition two assessed by randomly dividing the entire trial cohort into 10 pseudo trial centers and calculating the average R2 between treatment hazard ratios for ICE and OS).  Results:   BF1, BF2, DM, and MFS satisfied the four Prentice criteria. However, with the two-condition meta-analytic approach, there was strong correlation between MFS and OS (τ = 0.86), moderate correlation between DM and OS (τ = 0.66), and weaker correlation between BF1 (τ = 0.25) or BF2 (τ = 0.40) and OS. Similarly, for condition two, the treatment effect of antiandrogen therapy on MFS and OS were correlated (R2 = 0.67), but this was not true for BF1 (R2 = 0.09), BF2 (R2 = 0.12), or DM (R2 = 0.18) and OS.  Conclusion:   MFS is also a strong surrogate for OS in men receiving salvage radiation therapy for recurrence after prostatectomy. Caution should be used when inferring survival benefit from effects on BF in biochemically recurrent prostate cancer.

This study's objective was to characterise the mutational landscape of Indian prostate cancer using whole-exome sequencing to identify population-specific polymorphisms.  Methods:   Whole-exome sequencing was performed of 58 treatment-naive primary prostate tumors of Indian origin. Multiple computational and statistical analyses were used to profile the known common mutations, other deleterious mutations, driver genes, prognostic biomarkers, and gene signatures unique to each clinical parameter. Cox analysis was performed to validate survival-associated genes. McNemar test identified genes significant to recurrence and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted to determine its accuracy. OncodriveCLUSTL algorithm was used to deduce driver genes. The druggable target identified was modeled with its known inhibitor using Autodock.  Results:   TP53 was the most commonly mutated gene in our cohort. Three novel deleterious variants unique to the Indian prostate cancer subtype were identified: POLQ, FTHL17, and OR8G1. COX regression analysis identified ACSM5, a mitochondrial gene responsible for survival. CYLC1 gene, which encodes for sperm head cytoskeletal protein, was identified as an unfavorable prognostic biomarker indicative of recurrence. The novel POLQ mutant, also identified as a driver gene, was evaluated as the druggable target in this study. POLQ, a DNA repair enzyme implicated in various cancer types, is overexpressed and is associated with a poor prognosis. The mutant POLQ was subjected to structural analysis and modeled with its known inhibitor novobiocin resulting in decreased binding efficiency necessitating the development of a better drug.  Conclusion:   In this pilot study, the molecular profiling using multiple computational and statistical analyses revealed distinct polymorphisms in the Indian prostate cancer cohort. The mutational signatures identified provide a valuable resource for prognostic stratification and targeted treatment strategies for Indian prostate cancer patients.

No effect of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) on its performance has been established. Purpose: To study the impact of concurrent ADT on disease detection with 18F-fluciclovine PET in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods: Data from patients with prostate cancer who had been receiving ADT for ≥3 months at the time of undergoing an 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-three scans from 71 patients were included. The scans indicated rising prostate-specific antigen (n = 58), staging advanced disease (n = 4) or therapeutic monitoring (n = 9). Patients’ medical records provided baseline clinical data and post-scan outcomes (median follow-up 40 months). Results: Malignant lesions with increased uptake of 18F-fluciclovine were detected in 60/73 (82%) scans; 33 (45%) had lesions in the prostate/bed and 46 (63%) in extraprostatic sites. Patients received ADT for a median of 2 years (range 3 months to >10 years) pre-scan. The time on ADT did not influence detection; the detection rates were 89% for patients who had received ADT for <1 year, 63% for a treatment period of 1−<2 years, 83% for 2−4 years, 78% for >4−10 years, and 67% for a treatment period of >10 years. Conclusion: 18F-fluciclovine detected recurrent or metastatic lesions in 82% of patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT.

To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate triennially to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries, vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Database are presented for the most prevalent cancer types by race, and cancer-related and treatment-related side-effects are also briefly described. More than 18 million Americans (8.3 million males and 9.7 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2022. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,523,230), melanoma of the skin (760,640), and colon and rectum (726,450) among males and breast (4,055,770), uterine corpus (891,560), and thyroid (823,800) among females. More than one-half (53%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and two-thirds (67%) were aged 65 years or older. One of the largest racial disparities in treatment is for rectal cancer, for which 41% of Black patients with stage I disease receive proctectomy or proctocolectomy compared to 66% of White patients. Surgical receipt is also substantially lower among Black patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 49% for stages I-II and 16% for stage III versus 55% and 22% for White patients, respectively. These treatment disparities are exacerbated by the fact that Black patients continue to be less likely to be diagnosed with stage I disease than White patients for most cancers, with some of the largest disparities for female breast (53% vs 68%) and endometrial (59% vs 73%). Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based strategies and equitable access to available resources are needed to mitigate disparities for communities of color and optimize care for people with a history of cancer.

Objectives:   To report and discuss the prostate and seminal vesicles (SV) reference ranges and characteristics in HFM and their associations with clinical, seminal, biochemical parameters.  Methods:   188 men (35.6 ± 6.0 years) from a cohort of 248 HFM were studied, evaluating, on the same day, clinical, biochemical, seminal, TRUS parameters following Standard Operating Procedures.  Results:   TRUS reference ranges and characteristics of the prostate and SV of HFM are reported herein. The mean PV was ∼25 ml. PV lower and upper limits were 15 and 35 ml, defining prostate hypotrophy and enlargement, respectively. PV was positively associated with age, waistline, current smoking (but not with T levels), seminal volume (and negatively with seminal pH), prostate inhomogeneity, macrocalcifications, calcification size and prostate arterial parameters, SV volume before and after ejaculation, deferential and epididymal size. Prostate calcifications and inhomogeneity were frequent, while midline prostatic cysts were rare and small. Ejaculatory duct abnormalities were absent. Periprostatic venous plexus size was positively associated with prostate calcifications, SV volume and arterial peak systolic velocity. Lower and upper limits of SV anterior-posterior diameter after ejaculation were 6 and 16 mm, defining SV hypotrophy or dilation, respectively. SV total volume before ejaculation and delta SV total volume (DSTV) positively correlated with ejaculate volume, and DSTV correlated positively with sperm progressive motility. SV total volume after ejaculation was associated negatively with SV ejection fraction and positively with distal ampullas size. SV US abnormalities were rare.

(2) Material and methods: We have conducted a prospective study on 356 patients undergoing transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy, for suspicion of prostate cancer. All patients were examined using bi-dimensional shear wave ultrasonography, which was followed by standard systematic transrectal prostate biopsy. The mean elasticity of each of the twelve systematic biopsy target zones was recorded and compared with the pathological examination results in all patients. The final dataset has included data from 223 patients with confirmed prostate cancer. Three machine learning classification algorithms (logistic regression, a decision tree classifier and a dense neural network) were implemented and their performance in predicting the positive lesions from the elastographic data measurements was assessed. (3) Results: The area under the curve (AUC) results were as follows: for logistic regression-0.88, for decision tree classifier-0.78 and for the dense neural network-0.94. Further use of an upsampling strategy for the training set of the neural network slightly improved its performance. Using an ensemble learning model, which combined the three machine learning models, we have obtained a final accuracy of 98%.

The majority of skin lesions gradually regressed after malignancy treatment. To our knowledge, our three cases of paraneoplastic eczematous dermatitis are the first to be associated with gastric, prostate and endometrial cancer. Additionally, we report a case of a patient with alopecia areata of the beard associated with thyroid cancer.

Patients and methods:   Men without a PCa diagnosis receiving mpMRI before biopsy in the Prospective Loyola University mpMRI (PLUM) Prostate Biopsy Cohort (2015-2020) were included. Data from a separate institution were used for external validation. The primary outcome was diagnosis of no cancer, grade group (GG)1 PCa, and clinically significant (cs)PCa (≥GG2). Binary logistic regression was used to explore standard clinical and mpMRI variables (prostate volume, Prostate Imaging-Reporting Data System [PI-RADS] version 2.0 lesions) with the final PLUM RC, based on a multinomial logistic regression model. Receiver-operating characteristic curve, calibration curves, and decision-curve analysis were evaluated in the training and validation cohorts.  Results:   A total of 1010 patients were included for development (N = 674 training [47.8% PCa, 30.9% csPCa], N = 336 internal validation) and 371 for external validation. The PLUM RC outperformed the PBCG RC in the training (area under the curve [AUC] 85.9% vs 66.0%; P < 0.001), internal validation (AUC 88.2% vs 67.8%; P < 0.001) and external validation (AUC 83.9% vs 69.4%; P < 0.001) cohorts for csPCa detection. The PBCG RC was prone to overprediction while the PLUM RC was well calibrated. At a threshold probability of 15%, the PLUM RC vs the PBCG RC could avoid 13.8 vs 2.7 biopsies per 100 patients without missing any csPCa. At a cost level of missing 7.5% of csPCa, the PLUM RC could have avoided 41.0% (566/1381) of biopsies compared to 19.1% (264/1381) for the PBCG RC. The PLUM RC compared favourably with the Stanford Prostate Cancer Calculator (SPCC; AUC 84.1% vs 81.1%; P = 0.002) and the MRI-European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) RC (AUC 84.5% vs 82.6%; P = 0.05).

With increasing researches on molecules which mediate cancer progression, molecular mechanism has gradually become the pivot of osteosarcoma research and treatment.  Aim:   Our study aimed at investigating the function of G3BP stress granule assembly factor 2 (G3BP2), which is an oncogene for breast cancer (BC) and prostate cancer but remains unknown in osteosarcoma cells.  Methods:   Related gene expression was confirmed by RT-qPCR. Functional assays including immunofluorescence (IF), colony formation, transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) as well as transwell assays were utilized to test the cell biological process caused by the genes. Meanwhile, RNA pull-down assay, along with luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays, was utilized to detect the interaction G3BP2, miR-124-3p and FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) may exert on the regulation of osteosarcoma cells.  Results:   G3BP2 was with high expression in osteosarcoma cells, and it aggravated the malignant cell behaviors in osteosarcoma. Additionally, miR-124-3p was verified to negatively regulate G3BP2 expression in osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, lncRNA FGD5-AS1 was predicted and testified to be the sponge of miR-124-3p and modulated G3BP2 expression positively. Subsequently, FGA5-AS1 accelerated osteosarcoma cell proliferation through up-regulating G3BP2. Furthermore, we identified EBF transcription factor 1 (EBF1) as the transcription factor for FGA5-AS1, and EBF1 served as a tumor facilitator in osteosarcoma cells.

This study conducted a cost-utility analysis of PSMA PET/CT compared with conventional imaging for patients with newly diagnosed, intermediate-risk or high-risk primary prostate cancer.  Perspective:   Australian healthcare perspective.  Setting:   Tertiary.  Methods:   A decision-analytic Markov model combined data from a variety of sources. The time horizon was 35 years. The sensitivity and specificity of PSMA PET/CT and CT alone were based on meta-analyses and the test accuracy of CT+WBBS was based on a single randomised controlled trial. Health outcomes included cases detected, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years. Costs related to other diagnostic tests, initial treatment, adverse events, and post-disease progression were included. All costs were reported in 2021 Australian Dollars (A$).  Results:   The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PSMA PET/CT was estimated to be A $21,147/quality-adjusted life-year gained versus CT+WBBS, and A$36,231/quality-adjusted life-year gained versus CT alone. The results were most sensitive to the time horizon, and the initial treatments received by patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer. The probability of PSMA PET/CT being cost effective was estimated to be 91% versus CT+WBBS and 89% versus CT alone, using a threshold of AU$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained.

Objective:   To develop a prediction model for urinary tract cancer in patients referred with haematuria.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective observational study was conducted in 10 282 patients from 110 hospitals across 26 countries, aged ≥16 yr and referred to secondary care with haematuria. Patients with a known or previous urological malignancy were excluded.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcomes were the presence or absence of urinary tract cancer (bladder cancer, upper tract urothelial cancer [UTUC], and renal cancer). Mixed-effect multivariable logistic regression was performed with site and country as random effects and clinically important patient-level candidate predictors, chosen a priori, as fixed effects. Predictors were selected primarily using clinical reasoning, in addition to backward stepwise selection. Calibration and discrimination were calculated, and bootstrap validation was performed to calculate optimism.  Results and limitations:   The unadjusted prevalence was 17.2% (n = 1763) for bladder cancer, 1.20% (n = 123) for UTUC, and 1.00% (n = 103) for renal cancer. The final model included predictors of increased risk (visible haematuria, age, smoking history, male sex, and family history) and reduced risk (previous haematuria investigations, urinary tract infection, dysuria/suprapubic pain, anticoagulation, catheter use, and previous pelvic radiotherapy). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final model was 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.85-0.87). The model is limited to patients without previous urological malignancy.  Conclusions:   This cancer prediction model is the first to consider established and novel urinary tract cancer diagnostic markers. It can be used in secondary care for risk stratifying patients and aid the clinician's decision-making process in prioritising patients for investigation.  Patient summary:   We have developed a tool that uses a person's characteristics to determine the risk of cancer if that person develops blood in the urine (haematuria).

It has been shown that the activity of TP73-AS1 is controlled by several miRNAs, but post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate TP73-AS1 activity in prostate cancer remain highly elusive. Accordingly, in the present study, we aimed to determine the miRNAs that are involved in the regulation of TP73-AS1 in prostate cancer and to show the effects of these molecules on the malignant proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Remarkably, colony formation and cell migration were suppressed while cell cycle arrest and apoptosis were induced in prostate cancer cells overexpressing miR-200a and miR-320a. miR-200a and miR-320a were found to be upregulated in TP73-AS1 suppressed prostate cancer cells. Also, TP73-AS1 was shown to be downregulated following miR-200a and miR-320a overexpression. However, overexpression of miR-320a had no significant effect on the expression of TP73. Further analysis revealed that miR-320a induces p53-dependent apoptosis.

Methods:   Data on prostate cancer patients at a single tertiary cancer center from January 2019 - June 2019 were queried. The cohort of patients from the queried list were evaluated for their eligibility for genetic testing. From the patients that were eligible for testing, the rate of referrals was ascertained. A 10-item questionnaire was concurrently sent to providers to understand germline genetic testing patterns and potential barriers.  Results:   Only 39% of the eligible prostate cancer patients were referred, with testing completed in 11% with indications. 30% of providers reported they would be comfortable completing genetic counseling themselves. The identified barriers to provide genetic testing themselves were lack of time and expertise (50%). Other barriers included: lack of genetic counselor workforce (70%), lack of knowledge of genetic testing and the inadequate co-ordination of referrals (60%).  Conclusion:   In this retrospective study, many patients met the criteria for GC, however, the referrals for this patient population are inconsistent, and only a handful of the eligible patients completed testing.

SC16 was functionalized with DTPA-CHX-A"" chelator and radiolabeled with 177Lu to produce 177Lu-DTPA-SC16.

Dose-dependent treatment efficacy and specificity of 177Lu-DTPA-SC16 radionuclide therapy were evaluated in H660 and DU145 xenograft-bearing mice. Safety of the agent was assessed by monitoring hematologic parameters. 177Lu-DTPA-SC16 showed high tumor uptake and specificity in H660 xenografts, with minimal uptake in DU145 xenografts. At all three tested doses of 177Lu-DTPA-SC16 (4.63, 9.25, and 27.75 MBq/mouse), complete responses were observed in H660-bearing mice; 9.25 and 27.75 MBq/mouse doses were curative. Even the lowest tested dose proved curative in five (63%) of eight mice, and recurring tumors could be successfully re-treated at the same dose to achieve complete responses. In DU145 xenografts, 177Lu-DTPA-SC16 therapy did not inhibit tumor growth. Platelets and hematocrit transiently dropped, reaching nadir at 2 to 3 wk. This was out of range only in the highest-dose cohort and quickly recovered to normal range by week 4. Weight loss was observed only in the highest-dose cohort.

However, to date, the impact of marital status on the survival of patients with retroperitoneal liposarcomas (RPLs) has not been established.  Methods:   A total of 1211 eligible patients diagnosed with RPLs were identified in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The relationships between marital status and survival in patients with RPLs were assessed. Patients were stratified by age to determine whether an association exists between marital status and age. We also probed the association between marital status and survival in males and females.  Results:   Our findings suggest that divorced, separated, or widowed patients have more advanced cancer stages, and more of these patients do not undergo surgery. Meanwhile, divorced, separated, or widowed patients have worse survival outcomes than married patients (overall survival (OS): HR = 1.66 (95% CI, 1.12, 2.46)); cancer-specific survival (CSS): HR = 1.90 (95% CI, 1.13, 3.19)). OS does not differ between single patients and married patients (HR = 1.21 [95% CI, 0.81, 1.81]) or CSS (HR = 1.36 [95% CI, 0.80, 2.29]). In addition, these results demonstrate that being divorced, separated, or widowed can play a significant detrimental role in mortality in older and female patients.

Methods and results:   We reviewed institutional databases for in-house cases with a history of PCa and histopathologic evidence of NE differentiation during the disease course. In all, 79 cases were identified: 32 primary and 47 metastases. Metastatic lesions were in liver (n = 15), lymph node (n = 9), bone (n = 6), lung (n = 3), brain (n = 1), and other sites (n = 13). In all, 63 of 76 (82%) cases with NE differentiation and available history were posttherapy: six postradiation therapy (RT), 24 post- androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), and 33 post-RT + ADT. Morphologic assessment (n = 79): (i) 23 pure small-cell/high-grade NE carcinoma (HGNEC): 20/23 metastatic; (ii) 10 combined high-grade PCa and small-cell/HGNEC: 9/10 primary; (iii) 15 PCa with diffuse NE immunohistochemistry (IHC) marker positivity/differentiation, associated with nested to sheet-like growth of cells with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, yet diffuse positivity for at least one prostatic and one NE IHC marker: all metastatic; (iv) 11 PCa with patchy NE differentiation, displaying more than single-cell positivity for NE IHC: five primary / six metastatic; (v) nine PCa with focal NE marker positive cells: four primary / five metastatic; (vi) 11 PCa with 'Paneth cell-like' change: all primary.  Conclusions:   In this contemporary series, the majority of NE differentiation in the setting of PCa was seen posttherapy.

To date, traditional ceRNA bioinformatic studies have investigated microRNAs as the only factor regulating gene expression. Growing evidence suggests that genomic (e.g., copy number alteration [CNA]), transcriptomic (e.g., transcription factors [TFs]), and epigenomic (e.g., DNA methylation [DM]) factors can influence ceRNA regulatory networks. Herein, we used the Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, a machine learning approach, to integrate DM, CNA, and TFs data with RNA expression to infer ceRNA networks in cancer risk. The gene-regulating factors-mediated ceRNA networks were identified in four hormone-dependent (HD) cancer types: prostate, breast, colorectal, and endometrial. The shared ceRNAs across HD cancer types were further investigated using survival analysis, functional enrichment analysis, and protein-protein interaction network analysis. We found two (BUB1 and EXO1) and one (RRM2) survival-significant ceRNA(s) shared across breast-colorectal-endometrial and prostate-colorectal-endometrial combinations, respectively. Both BUB1 and BUB1B genes were identified as shared ceRNAs across more than two HD cancers of interest. These genes play a critical role in cell division, spindle-assembly checkpoint signalling, and correct chromosome alignment. Furthermore, shared ceRNAs across multiple HD cancers have been involved in essential cancer pathways such as cell cycle, p53 signalling, and chromosome segregation. Identifying ceRNAs' roles across multiple related cancers will improve our understanding of their shared disease biology.

This study aimed to explore how advice on modified fibre and lactose intakes during pelvic radiotherapy was associated with nutrient intakes amongst patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   A total of 77 Swedish men who underwent radiotherapy (50/2 Gy + boost 20-30 Gy) in 2009-2014 due to prostate cancer were given dietary advice at radiotherapy onset (baseline) and at 4 and 8 weeks after radiotherapy onset, to modify their fibre and lactose intakes. At baseline, the participants completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and a 24-h dietary recall. At 4 and 8 weeks, the participants completed the FFQ and a 4-day estimated food record.Fibre and lactose intakes were measured by intake scores calculated from the FFQs. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyse associations between intake scores and fibre- and lactose-related nutrients.  Results:   In adjusted analyses, there were few significant associations between dietary advice on modified fibre and lactose intakes and observed intakes of fibre- and lactose-related nutrients. A more modified lactose intake was thus associated with a lower intake of calcium (P = 0.041), whilst a more modified fibre intake was associated with a higher value for the change in intake of vitamin C (P = 0.016).  Conclusions:   Dietary advice on modified fibre and lactose intake was in most cases not significantly associated with altered nutrient intakes, rather the energy and nutrient intakes were mostly stable during the pelvic radiotherapy.

Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that AR inhibition drove tumors toward a neuroendocrine-like disease state. Additionally, epigenomic profiling revealed massive enzalutamide-induced reprogramming of pioneer factor FOXA1 from inactive chromatin sites toward active cis-regulatory elements that dictate prosurvival signals. Notably, treatment-induced FOXA1 sites were enriched for the circadian clock component ARNTL. Posttreatment ARNTL levels were associated with patients' clinical outcomes, and ARNTL knockout strongly decreased prostate cancer cell growth. Our data highlight a remarkable cistromic plasticity of FOXA1 following AR-targeted therapy and revealed an acquired dependency on the circadian regulator ARNTL, a novel candidate therapeutic target.  Significance:   Understanding how prostate cancers adapt to AR-targeted interventions is critical for identifying novel drug targets to improve the clinical management of treatment-resistant disease. Our study revealed an enzalutamide-induced epigenomic plasticity toward prosurvival signaling and uncovered the circadian regulator ARNTL as an acquired vulnerability after AR inhibition, presenting a novel lead for therapeutic development.

This single-institution, retrospective study included 12 mCRPC patients with PTEN alterations who had received cabazitaxel therapy. Five patients (41%) responded to cabazitaxel therapy with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level decline of ≥30% from baseline, and all of them had responded to prior docetaxel therapy with a PSA decline of ≥30%. None of the patients with a poor response to prior docetaxel therapy responded well to cabazitaxel therapy. Of the seven patients who did not respond to cabazitaxel and whose PSA declined from baseline was <30%, five (71%) were also refractory to prior docetaxel therapy. The PSA responses to docetaxel and cabazitaxel were significantly correlated (p = 0.027). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that progression-free survival (PFS) for cabazitaxel was significantly shorter for prior docetaxel nonresponders (3.3 versus 9.1 months, p = 0.028). Multivariate analysis revealed that a poor response to prior docetaxel (PSA decline < 30%) (hazard ratio [HR] = 6.382, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.172-34.750, p = 0.032) and baseline PSA of ≥20 ng/ml (HR = 33.584, 95% CI 2.332-483.671, p = 0.010) were independent prognostic factors for PFS with cabazitaxel therapy.

Nevertheless, whether the urogenital function and quality of life after taTME are better as compared to laTME requires further study. According to the existing studies, taTME and laTME are not significantly different in symptoms of the urology system for male patients, but some large sample clinical studies show that the incidence of urethral mechanical injury after taTME is higher. Unfortunately, there is no elaboration on that for females. The sexual function of male patients after taTME and laTME is both impaired. The sexual function of male patients will be relieved to different degrees over time, but there is no significant difference. Compared with laTME, taTME shows advantages in the sexual function for female patients. There is no significant difference in short-term urogenital system function between taTME and laTME at present. As a new surgical approach, the impact on urogenital system function after taTME is acceptable. However, whether there is a significant difference in urogenital function between taTME and laTME needs further research.

Methods: A descriptive cohort study and an anatomical observation study were carried out. A total of 38 male patients with rectal cancer who underwent TME in the Department of Colorectal Surgery at the affiliated Union hospital of Fujian Medical University between November 2013 and March 2015 were included. A total of 4 hemipelvis were examined at the Laboratory of Clinical Applied Anatomy, Fujian Medical University. The following outcomes were observed: 1) the clinical significance of bleeding of the prostatic part of NVB: surgical videos were reviewed and the incidence of bleeding was recorded. The urogenital function was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) score. The correlation between prostatic part bleeding and postoperative urogenital function was evaluated. 2) anatomical observation: the vessels, nerve fibers, as well as their surrounding fatty tissue from the prostatic part were treated as a whole, namely, the fat pad of the prostatic part. The anatomical architecture of the prostatic part in the surgical videos was reviewed and interpreted with the cadaveric findings. Categorical variables were compared between groups using a Fisher exact probability. while continuous variables with skewed distribution were compared between groups using the Mann-Whiteny U test. Results: The median age of the included 38 patients was 57 years (range, 31-75), and the median tumor distance to the anal verge was 6 cm (range, 1-8). Of them, a total number of 21 (55.3%) patients had bleeding of the prostatic part of NVB (bleeding group), while the rest had not (17 cases, 44.7%, non-bleeding group). 1) the clinical significance of bleeding of the prostatic part of NVB. The urinary function significantly decreased in patients in the bleeding group according to IPSS score after the 3rd month and the 6rd month of the surgery [7 (0-16) vs. 2 (0-3), Z=-1.787, P=0.088; 2 (0-15) vs. 0 (0-2), Z=-2.270, P=0.028]. There was no difference regarding the IPSS score between the two groups after 1 year of the surgery (P>0.05). With a total of 23 patients with normal preoperative sexual activity included, 87.5% (7/8) of patients in the non-bleeding group can expect to return to their preoperative baseline, this incidence was significantly higher than that of only 40% (6/15) in the bleeding group (P=0.029). 2) anatomical observation: for cadaveric observation, the prostatic part of NVB was located in the narrow triangular space composed of anterolateral walls of the rectum, the posterolateral surface of the prostate and the medial surface of the levator ani musculature. The tiny vascular branches and nerve fibers from the prostatic part were hard to identify. The cavernosal nerves cannot reliably be distinguished from the neural supply to the prostate, rectum and levator ani. In the cross-section of levels of prostatic base and mid-prostate in cadaveric hemipelvis specimens, the boundary of the prostatic part fat pad was partly overlapped and merged with the boundary of the mesorectum. Intraoperative observation showed that the areas of overlap referred to the rectal branches from the prostatic part piercing the proper fascia to supply the mesorectum, which carried the largest tension and high risk of bleeding during circumferential dissection toward the perirectal plane. The ultrasonic scalpel was required to pre-coagulate the rectal branches at the point close to the proper fascia of the rectum to prevent bleeding. In the cross-section of the prostatic apex level, the prostatic part approached ventrally and its boundary was away from the boundary of the mesorectum. Conclusions: NVB prostatic part injury is one of the causes of urogenital dysfunction after TME. The nerve fibers from the prostatic part were tiny, and its functional zones cannot be distinguished during operation. Therein, the fat pad of the prostatic part should be protected as a whole. Understanding the morphology of the fat pad of the prostatic part provides invaluable surgical guidance to dissect this critical area. When dissecting around the anterolateral rectal wall, appropriate anti-traction tension should be maintained and the rectal branches from the prostatic part should be coagulated with an ultrasonic scalpel to prevent bleeding.""","""['X J Wang', 'Z F Zheng', 'Y Huang', 'P Chi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi""","""['Anatomical observation and clinical significance of rectosacral fascia in total mesorectal resection.', 'An Optimal Surgical Plane for Laparoscopic Functional Total Mesorectal Excision in Rectal Cancer.', 'Nerve-guided laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for distal rectal cancer.', 'Significance of the intact of the fascia propria in protection of pelvic plexus during total mesorectal excision.', 'Total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer with emphasis on pelvic autonomic nerve preservation: Expert technical tips for robotic surgery.']"""

Methods:   We measured clonogenic survival in DU145 cells treated with 80.4-ppm BSH or 86.9-ppm BPA, or their respective vehicles, after irradiation with 6-MV X-rays, 1.2-keV/μm (low linear energy transfer [LET]) protons, or 9.9-keV/μm (high-LET) protons. We also measured γH2AX and 53BP1 foci in treated cells at 1 and 24 h after irradiation with the same conditions.  Results:   We found that BSH radiosensitized DU145 cells across all radiation types. However, no difference was found in relative radiosensitization, characterized by the sensitization enhancement ratio or the relative biological effectiveness, for vehicle- versus BSH-treated cells. No differences were found in numbers of γH2AX or 53BP1 foci or γH2AX/53BP1 colocalized foci for vehicle- versus BSH-treated cells across radiation types. BPA did not radiosensitize DU145 cells nor induced any significant differences when comparing vehicle- versus BPA-treated cells for clonogenic cell survival or γH2AX and 53BP1 foci or γH2AX/53BP1 colocalized foci.  Conclusions:   Treatment with 11 B, at concentrations of 80.4 ppm from BSH or 86.9 ppm from BPA, had no effect on the biological effectiveness of proton beams in DU145 prostate cancer cells. Our results agree with published theoretical calculations indicating that the contribution of alpha particles from such reactions to the total absorbed dose and biological effectiveness is negligible.

Analyzing AR-transcriptional complex related to CRPC is therefore important towards understanding the mechanism of therapy resistance. While studying its mechanism, we observed that a transmembrane protein called neuropilin-2 (NRP2) plays a contributory role in forming a novel AR-transcriptional complex containing nuclear pore proteins. Using immunogold electron microscopy, high-resolution confocal microscopy, chromatin immunoprecipitation, proteomics, and other biochemical techniques, we delineated the molecular mechanism of how a specific splice variant of NRP2 becomes sumoylated upon ligand stimulation and translocates to the inner nuclear membrane. This splice variant of NRP2 then stabilizes the complex between AR and nuclear pore proteins to promote CRPC specific gene expression. Both full-length and splice variants of AR have been identified in this specific transcriptional complex. In vitro cell line-based assays indicated that depletion of NRP2 not only destabilizes the AR-nuclear pore protein interaction but also inhibits the transcriptional activities of AR. Using an in vivo bone metastasis model, we showed that the inhibition of NRP2 led to the sensitization of CRPC cells toward established anti-AR therapies such as enzalutamide.

NSCLC accounts for 84% of all lung cancer cases. In recent years, advances in pathway understanding, methods for discovering novel genetic biomarkers, and new drugs designed to inhibit the signaling cascades have enabled clinicians to personalize therapy for NSCLC.  Objectives:   The primary aim of this study is to identify the genes associated with NSCLC that harbor pathogenic variants that could be causative for NSCLC. The second aim is to investigate their roles in different pathways that lead to NSCLC.  Methods:   We examined exome-sequencing datasets from 54 NSCLC patients to characterize the variants associated with NSCLC.  Results:   Our findings revealed that 17 variants in 14 genes were considered highly pathogenic, including CDKN2A, ERBB2, FOXP1, IDH1, JAK3, KMT2D, K-Ras, MSH3, MSH6, POLE, RNF43, TCF7L2, TP53, and TSC1. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase activity, protein binding, ATP binding, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and Ras guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. Pathway analysis of these genes yielded different cancer-related pathways, including colorectal, prostate, endometrial, pancreatic, PI3K-Akt signaling pathways, and signaling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells. Module 1 from protein-protein interactions (PPIs) identified genes that harbor pathogenic SNPs. Three of the most deleterious SNPs are ERBB2 (rs1196929947), K-Ras (rs121913529), and POLE (rs751425952). Interestingly, one patient has a pathogenic K-Ras variant (rs121913529) co-occurred with the missense variant (rs752054698) inTSC1 gene.

Additionally, the prognostic factors for freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and progression-free survival (PFS) in this patient cohort were analyzed.  Materials and methods:   The clinical data of 503 patients with biopsy-confirmed PCa were evaluated retrospectively. All patients had clearly evident tumors on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) for ADC values. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to determine prognostic factors for FFBF and PFS.  Results:   The median follow-up was 72.9 months.

Significantly lower ADC values were found in patients with a high PSA level; advanced clinical stage; higher ISUP score, and higher risk group than their counterparts. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed an ADC cut-off value of 0.737 × 10-3 mm2/sec for tumor recurrence. Patients who progressed had a lower mean ADC value than those who did not (0.712 ± 0.158 vs. 1.365 ± 0.227 × 10-3 mm2/sec; p < 0.001).

The FFBF and PFS were found to be correlated with tumor ADC value and ISUP grades in multivariable analysis. Additionally, older age was found to be a significant predictor of worse PFS.  Conclusions:   Lower ADC values were found in patients with high-risk characteristics such as a high serum PSA level, stage or grade of tumor, or high-risk disease, implying that ADC values could be used to predict prognosis.

In recent years, this weakly supervised learning paradigm has become very popular in histological image analysis because it alleviates the burden of labeling all cancerous regions of large Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in detail. However, these methods require large datasets to perform properly, and many approaches only focus on simple binary classification. This often does not match the real-world problems where multi-label settings are frequent and possible constraints must be taken into account. In this work, we propose a novel multi-label MIL formulation based on inequality constraints that is able to incorporate prior knowledge about instance proportions. Our method has a theoretical foundation in optimization with log-barrier extensions, applied to bag-level class proportions. This encourages the model to respect the proportion ordering during training. Extensive experiments on a new public dataset of prostate cancer WSIs analysis, SICAP-MIL, demonstrate that using the prior proportion information we can achieve instance-level results similar to supervised methods on datasets of similar size. In comparison with prior MIL settings, our method allows for ∼13% improvements in instance-level accuracy, and ∼3% in the multi-label mean area under the ROC curve at the bag-level.""","""['Julio Silva-Rodríguez', 'Arne Schmidt', 'María A Sales', 'Rafael Molina', 'Valery Naranjo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['Iterative multiple instance learning for weakly annotated whole slide image classification.', 'Weakly supervised histopathology image segmentation with self-attention.', 'Constrained multiple instance learning for ulcerative colitis prediction using histological images.', 'A comparative study of multiple instance learning methods for cancer detection using T-cell receptor sequences.', 'Not-so-supervised: A survey of semi-supervised, multi-instance, and transfer learning in medical image analysis.']"""

Liquid biopsy assays provide an agnostic way to follow the complex trajectory of cancer, providing better patient stratification tools for optimized treatment. Here, we present the development of a low-volume liquid biopsy assay called cyc-DEP (cyclic immunofluorescent imaging on dielectrophoretic chip) to profile biomarkers collected on a dielectrophoretic microfluidic chip platform. To enable on-chip cyclic imaging, we optimized a fluorophore quenching method and sequential rounds of on-chip staining with fluorescently conjugated primary antibodies. cyc-DEP allows for the quantification of a multiplex array of proteins using 25 µl of a patient plasma sample. We utilized nanoparticles from a prostate adenocarcinoma (LNCaP) cell line and a panel of six target proteins to develop our proof-of-concept technique. We then used cyc-DEP to quantify blood plasma levels of target proteins from healthy individuals, low-grade and high-grade prostate cancer patients (n = 3 each) in order to demonstrate that our platform is suitable for liquid biopsy analysis in its present form. To ensure accurate quantification of signal intensities and comparisons between different samples, we incorporated a signal intensity normalization method (fluorescent beads) and a custom signal intensity quantification algorithm that account for the distribution of signal across hundreds of collection regions on each chip. Our technique enabled a threefold improvement in multiplicity for detecting proteins associated with fluid samples, opening doors for early detection, and active surveillance through quantification of a multiplex array of biomarkers from low-volume liquid biopsies.""","""['Kyle T Gustafson', 'Zeynep Sayar', 'Hillary Le', 'Steven L Gustafson', 'Austin Gower', 'Augusta Modestino', 'Stuart Ibsen', 'Michael J Heller', 'Sadik Esener', 'Sebnem E Eksi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Electrophoresis""","""['A bead-based immunofluorescence-assay on a microfluidic dielectrophoresis platform for rapid dengue virus detection.', 'Automated fluorescence quantification of extracellular vesicles collected from blood plasma using dielectrophoresis.', 'A Pilot Proof-Of-Principle Analysis Demonstrating Dielectrophoresis (DEP) as a Glioblastoma Biomarker Platform.', 'Methods of Generating Dielectrophoretic Force for Microfluidic Manipulation of Bioparticles.', 'Dielectrophoretic platforms for bio-microfluidic systems.', 'Clinical Application of Small Extracellular Vesicles in Gynecologic Malignancy Treatments.']"""

Patients and methods:   A total of 30 patients with localised PCa undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) were randomised (2:1) to either preoperative aerobic HIIT four-times weekly (EX; n = 20) or usual care (CON; n = 10) from time of inclusion until scheduled surgery. Tumour NK-cell infiltration was assessed by immunohistochemistry (CD56+ ) in diagnostic core needle biopsies and corresponding prostatic tissue from the RP. Changes in cardiorespiratory fitness, body composition, blood biochemistry, and health-related quality of life were also evaluated.  Results:   The change in tumour NK-cell infiltration did not differ between the EX and CON groups (between-group difference: -0.09 cells/mm2 , 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.85 to 1.66; P = 0.913) in the intention-to-treat analysis.

To understand the physiological effects of androgen deprivation in the late sexual development phase, we compared mature immunocastrated boars (n = 19; average age = 480 days) to young male immunocastrated pigs (n = 6; average age = 183 days) and young entire males (n = 6; average age = 186 days) as positive and negative controls, respectively.  Objectives:   We hypothesized that the timing of gonadotropin-releasing hormone suppression (early or late sexual development phases) influences the extent of reproductive function inhibition, histological structure of testicular tissue, and expression levels of selected genes related to steroid metabolism.  Materials and methods:   Antibody titer, hormonal status, and histomorphometric analysis of testicular tissue were subjected to principal component analysis followed by hierarchical clustering to evaluate the immunocastration effectiveness in mature boars.  Results:   Hierarchical clustering differentiated mature immunocastrated boars clustered with young immunocastrated pigs from those clustered with entire males. Although all mature immunocastrated boars responded to vaccination, as evidenced by the increased gonadotropin-releasing hormone antibody titers (p < 0.001), decreased serum luteinizing hormone concentrations (p = 0.002), and changes in testicular tissue vascularization (lighter and less red testicular parenchyma; p ≤ 0.001), the responses were variable. Sharp decreases in testes index (p < 0.001), Leydig cell volume density (p < 0.001), Leydig cell nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio (p < 0.001), and testosterone concentration (p < 0.001) were observed in mature immunocastrated boars clustered with young immunocastrated pigs compared with those that clustered with entire males. Additionally, mature immunocastrated boars clustered with young immunocastrated pigs showed lower hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 7 expression than entire males (p < 0.05). The young immunocastrated pigs group showed higher follicle-stimulating hormone receptors than the entire males and mature immunocastrated boars, lower steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression levels compared with entire males, and mature immunocastrated boars clustered with entire males (p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   The two-dose vaccination regime resulted in progressive but variable regression of testicular function in adult (post-pubertal) pigs; however, it was insufficient to induce a complete immunocastration response in all animals.""","""['Nina Batorek-Lukač', 'Kevin Kress', 'Marjeta Čandek-Potokar', 'Gregor Fazarinc', 'Martin Škrlep', 'Klavdija Poklukar', 'Raffael Wesoly', 'Volker Stefanski', 'Milka Vrecl']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Andrology""","""['Induction of immunocastration in pre-pubertal boars immunized with recombinant gonadotropin-releasing hormone conjugated with Salmonella Typhimurium flagellin fljB.', 'Active immunization against gonadotrophin-releasing hormone in Chinese male pigs: effects of dose on antibody titer, hormone levels and sexual development.', 'Reproductive status effects of pair-housed male pigs on natural, agonistic and sexual behaviours.', 'RFamide-related peptide 3 and gonadotropin-releasing hormone-II are autocrine-paracrine regulators of testicular function in the boar.', 'Differentiation of sexual behaviour in pigs.']"""

Methods:   We retrospectively conducted bone scans for 383 patients with prostate cancer. These patients were divided into two groups: 208 patients were injected with 99mTc-hydroxymethylene diphosphonate processed by VSBONE BSI, and 175 patients were injected with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate processed by BONENAVI. Three observers classified the skeletal segmentations as either a ""Match"" or ""Mismatch"" in the following regions: the skull, cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, pelvis, sacrum, humerus, rib, sternum, clavicle, scapula, and femur. Segmentation error was defined if two or more observers selected ""Mismatch"" in the same region. We calculated the segmentation error rate according to each administration group and evaluated the presence of hot spots suspected bone metastases in ""Mismatch"" regions. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to determine the association between segmentation error and variables like age, uptake time, total counts, extent of disease, and gamma cameras.  Results:   The regions of ""Mismatch"" were more common in the long tube bones for VSBONE BSI and in the pelvis and axial skeletons for BONENAVI. Segmentation error was observed in 49 cases (23.6%) with VSBONE BSI and 58 cases (33.1%) with BONENAVI. VSBONE BSI tended that ""Mismatch"" regions contained hot spots suspected of bone metastases in patients with multiple bone metastases and showed that patients with higher extent of disease (odds ratio = 8.34) were associated with segmentation error in multivariate logistic regression analysis.  Conclusions:   VSBONE BSI has a potential to be higher segmentation accuracy compared with BONENAVI. However, the segmentation error in VSBONE BSI occurred dependent on bone metastases burden.

Aim:   Conduct a large-volume cohort study with long-term follow-up to analyze specific and overall survival outcomes after surgery.  Method:   A single-center retrospective study of all patients operated on for localized high-risk and locally advanced prostate cancer was performed. Actuarial survival analyses and multivariate analyses were performed to discern predictive risk factors.  Results:   Five hundred patients were included.

Additional five-point (50, 150, 300, 500, 800 s/mm²) acquisitions were performed on scanner B in the morning and evening. ADC was measured in PZ at midgland using ADC maps reconstructed with various b-value combinations. ADC distributions from 2017 and 2020 were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test.

Long-term complications of cancer and its therapies may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but prospective studies using adjudicated cancer and CVD events are lacking.  Objectives:   The aim of this study was to assess the risk of CVD in cancer survivors in a prospective community-based study.  Methods:   We included 12,414 ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities) study participants. Cancer diagnoses were ascertained via linkage with state registries supplemented with medical records. Incident CVD outcomes were coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure (HF), stroke, and a composite of these. We used multivariable Poisson and Cox regressions to estimate the association of cancer with incident CVD.  Results:   Mean age was 54 years, 55% were female, and 25% were Black. A total of 3,250 participants (25%) had incident cancer over a median 13.6 years of follow-up. Age-adjusted incidence rates of CVD (per 1,000 person-years) were 23.1 (95% CI: 24.7-29.1) for cancer survivors and 12.0 (95% CI: 11.5-12.4) for subjects without cancer. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, cancer survivors had significantly higher risks of CVD (HR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.26-1.50), HF (HR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.38-1.68), and stroke (HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44), but not CHD (HR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.97-1.28). Breast, lung, colorectal, and hematologic/lymphatic cancers, but not prostate cancer, were significantly associated with CVD risk.  Conclusions:   Compared with persons without cancer, adult cancer survivors have significantly higher risk of CVD, especially HF, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.

One promising approach to reducing the level of this protein is Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) that is an emerging drug discovery technology. PROTACs are hetero-bifunctional molecules where one end binds to a protein of interest and the other to an E3 ligase ligand, initiating the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway for protein degradation. Two PROTACs with niclosamide as androgen receptor ligand and VHL-032 as the E3 ligase ligand have been designed and synthesized for suppressing proliferation of androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells via degrading androgen receptor. The in vitro antiproliferative assessment suggested that they can selectively suppress PC-3, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cell proliferation, but cannot inhibit DU145 cell proliferation.

Methods:   A pan-cancer comprehensive genomic profiling cohort (n = 213,199) was examined for overlap between BRCAm and MSI-H status. BRCA1/2 variant zygosity was examined and correlated with MSI-H status, tumor mutational burden, and genome-wide loss of heterozygosity (gLOH). Clinical histories of two patients with prostate cancer with co-occurring BRCAm and MSI-H are described.  Results:   HRD and MSI-H phenotypes were generally mutually exclusive events (P < .001). BRCAm that co-occurred together with high tumor mutational burden or MSI-H were predominantly monoallelic bystander alterations. In breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers, very few BRCAm occurred in the context of MSI-H; however, in prostate cancer, 12.8% of BRCA1 and 3.4% of BRCA2 alterations co-occurred with MSI-H. In these BRCA-associated cancers, co-occurring BRCAm were generally monoallelic and were not associated with elevated gLOH. Two patients with prostate cancer with co-occurring BRCAm and MSI-H showed resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibition but sensitivity to subsequent anti-programmed cell death protein 1 therapy.  Conclusion:   MSI-H status and HRD are generally mutually exclusive phenomena across cancer types, but may rarely co-occur, especially in prostate cancer. Although MSI-H samples had a higher BRCAm prevalence relative to microsatellite-stable tumors, these BRCA1/2 mutations were generally monoallelic and were not associated with elevated gLOH.

Our object was to describe the level of pre-testing and contamination in the Göteborg-1 prostate cancer screening trial.  Materials and methods:   A total of 20,000 men, 50-64 years old, were invited in 1994 and randomized to either a screening group (offered prostate specific antigen testing every 2 years) or to a control group. Follow-up was through December 31, 2014. Outcome measurement was overall testing in the screening group and control group. A positive prostate specific antigen test was defined as a prostate specific antigen ≥3 ng/ml.  Results:   In the study, 4.2% in the screening group and 4.6% men in the control group were tested before study start. During follow-up, 72% in the control group took at least 1 prostate specific antigen test (contamination) compared to 87% of men in the screening group.

Conclusions:   Similar proportions of men were prostate specific antigen-tested in both the screening group and control group, yet only a minority of contamination prostate specific antigens led to biopsy. Also, men in the screening group started screening at a younger age.

Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1) is involved in chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and transcriptional plasticity. Prior studies have demonstrated that CHD1 has distinct expression patterns in cancers with different molecular features, but its impact on drug responsiveness remains understudied. Here, we show that CHD1 promotes the susceptibility of prostate cancer cells to inhibitors targeting Aurora kinases, while depletion of CHD1 impairs their efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Pan-cancer drug sensitivity analyses revealed that high expression of CHD1 was associated with increased sensitivity to Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitors. Mechanistically, KPNA2 served as a direct target of CHD1 and suppressed the interaction of AURKA with the coactivator TPX2, thereby rendering cancer cells more vulnerable to AURKA inhibitors. Consistent with previous research reporting that loss of PTEN elevates CHD1 levels, studies in a genetically engineered mouse model, patient-derived organoids, and patient samples showed that PTEN defects are associated with a better response to AURKA inhibition in advanced prostate cancer. These observations demonstrate that CHD1 plays an important role in modulating Aurora kinases and drug sensitivities, providing new insights into biomarker-driven therapies targeting Aurora kinases for future clinical studies.  Significance:   CHD1 plays a critical role in controlling AURKA activation and promoting Aurora kinase inhibitor sensitivity, providing a potential clinical biomarker to guide cancer treatment.""","""['Haoyan Li', 'Yin Wang', 'Kevin Lin', 'Varadha Balaji Venkadakrishnan', 'Martin Bakht', 'Wei Shi', 'Chenling Meng', 'Jie Zhang', 'Kaitlyn Tremble', 'Xin Liang', 'Jian H Song', 'Xu Feng', 'Vivien Van', 'Pingna Deng', 'Jared K Burks', 'Ana Aparicio', 'Khandan Keyomarsi', 'Junjie Chen', 'Yue Lu', 'Himisha Beltran', 'Di Zhao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Structural basis for the design of allosteric inhibitors of the Aurora kinase A enzyme in the cancer chemotherapy.', 'The AURKA/TPX2 axis drives colon tumorigenesis cooperatively with MYC.', 'Aurora A kinase and its activator TPX2 are potential therapeutic targets in KRAS-induced pancreatic cancer.', 'Glioma pathogenesis-related protein 1 induces prostate cancer cell death through Hsc70-mediated suppression of AURKA and TPX2.', 'Allosteric Targeting of Aurora A Kinase Using Small Molecules: A Step Forward Towards Next Generation Medicines?', 'CHD1, a multifaceted epigenetic remodeler in prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, we aimed to prove the concept of pretherapeutic prediction of dosimetry based on imaging and laboratory measurements before the RLT treatment.  Methods:   Twenty-three patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with 177Lu-PSMA I&T RLT were included retrospectively. They had available pre-therapy 68 Ga-PSMA-HEBD-CC PET/CT and at least 3 planar and 1 SPECT/CT imaging for dosimetry. Overall, 43 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA I&T RLT were applied. Organ-based standard uptake values (SUVs) were obtained from pre-therapy PET/CT scans. Patient dosimetry was calculated for the kidney, liver, spleen, and salivary glands using Hermes Hybrid Dosimetry 4.0 from the planar and SPECT/CT images. Machine learning methods were explored for dose prediction from organ SUVs and laboratory measurements. The uncertainty of these dose predictions was compared with the population-based dosimetry estimates. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to assess the prediction uncertainty of estimated dosimetry.  Results:   An optimal machine learning method achieved a dosimetry prediction MAPE of 15.8 ± 13.2% for the kidney, 29.6% ± 13.7% for the liver, 23.8% ± 13.1% for the salivary glands, and 32.1 ± 31.4% for the spleen. In contrast, the prediction based on literature population mean has significantly larger MAPE (p < 0.01), 25.5 ± 17.3% for the kidney, 139.1% ± 111.5% for the liver, 67.0 ± 58.3% for the salivary glands, and 54.1 ± 215.3% for the spleen.

Methods:   320 HR-PCa patients treated with RS-RARP between 2011 and 2020 at a single high-volume center. The relationship between prostate volume, BML, prior BPH surgery and perioperative outcomes, Clavien-Dindo (CD) grade ≥ 2 90-day postoperative complications, positive surgical margins (PSMs), and urinary continence (UC) recovery was evaluated respectively in multivariable linear, logistic and Cox regression models. Complications were collected according to the standardized methodology proposed by EAU guidelines. UC recovery was defined as the use of zero or one safety pad.  Results:   Overall, 5.9% and 5.6% had respectively a BML or prior BPH surgery. Median PV was 45 g (range: 14-300). The rate of focal and non-focal PSMs was 8.4% and 17.8%. 53% and 10.9% patients had immediate UC recovery and CD ≥ 2. The 1- and 2-yr UC recovery was 84 and 85%.

This study assesses the impact of an intervention, namely a prostate MRI quality training lecture, on the participant's ability to apply PI-QUAL.  Methods:   Sixteen participants (radiologists, urologists, physicists, and computer scientists) of varying experience in reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI all assessed the image quality of ten examinations from different vendors and machines. Then, they attended a dedicated lecture followed by a hands-on workshop on MRI quality assessment using the PI-QUAL score.

Since EVs inherits genomic and proteomic patterns from the cell of origin, they are emerging as promising liquid biomarkers for human diseases. Flow cytometry is a popular method that is able to detect, characterize and determine the concentration of EVs with minimal sample preparation. However, the limited awareness of the scientific community to utilize standardization and calibration methods of flow cytometers is an important roadblock for data reproducibility and inter-laboratory comparison. A significant collaborative effort by the Extracellular Vesicle Flow Cytometry Working Group has led to the development of guidelines and best practices for using flow cytometry and reporting data in a way to improve rigor and reproducibility in EV research. At first look, standardization and calibration of flow cytometry for EV detection may seem burdensome and technically challenging for non-academic laboratories with limited technical training and knowledge in EV flow cytometry. In this study, we build on prior research efforts and provide a systematic approach to evaluate the performance of a high sensitivity flow cytometer (herein Apogee A60-Micro Plus) and fine-tune settings to improve detection sensitivity for EVs. We performed calibration of our flow cytometer to generate data with comparable units (nanometers, MESF). Finally, we applied our optimized protocol to measure the concentrations of prostate-derived EVs in healthy individuals and prostate cancer patients.

In conclusion, the results of this study show that NRF2 is downregulated in untreated PCa samples compared to normal PCa samples; however, it was upregulated in mCRPC samples compared to HSPC samples. These results demonstrated that NRF2 may serve as a tumor suppressor in tumorigenesis but promote PCa androgen-independent transferring after ADT treatment. Bioinformatics analysis showed that NRF2 was related to multiple signaling, such as the AGE-RAGE pathway, MAPK pathway, NF-kappa B signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Moreover, we revealed that the NRF2 inhibitor significantly inhibited tumorigenicity of CRPC cells in vitro. Of note, combination of the NRF2 inhibitor and autophagy inhibitor had a more significantly suppressive role than either ML385 or CQ, indicating that combination of CQ (autophagy inhibitor) and ML385 (NRF2 inhibitor) is a potential treatment of CRPC. Finally, we conformed that high levels of autophagy regulators LC3B, ULK1, and beclin1 significantly correlated to longer PSA recurrence-free survival time.

Results:   Of the 205 patients, 120 (58.5%) had evidence of abnormal prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression compatible with recurrent prostate cancer. Increasing PSA velocity (P = 0.01), International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group (P = 0.02), lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.05) and nodal positivity (P = 0.02) at the time of RP were more likely to demonstrate PSMA positivity.

TNBC is difficult to treat with targeted agents due to the lack of commonly targeted therapies within this subtype. Androgen receptor (AR) has been detected in 12-55% of TNBCs. AR stimulates breast tumor growth in the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), and it has become an emerging molecular target in TNBC treatment.  Methods:   Ceritinib is a small molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinase and it is used in the therapy of non-small lung cancer patients. Enzalutamide is a small molecule compound targeting the androgen receptor and it is used to treat prostate cancer. Combination therapy of these drugs were investigated using AR positive breast cancer mouse xenograft models. Also, combination treatment of ceritinib and paclitaxel investigated using AR- and AR low mouse xenograft and patient derived xenograft models.  Results:   We screened 133 FDA approved drugs that have a therapeutic effect of AR+ TNBC cells. From the screen, we identified two drugs, ceritinib and crizotinib. Since ceritinib has a well- defined role in androgen independent AR signaling pathways, we further investigated the effect of ceritinib. Ceritinib treatment inhibited RTK/ACK/AR pathway and other downstream pathways in AR+ TNBC cells. The combination of ceritinib and enzalutamide showed a robust inhibitory effect on cell growth of AR+ TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly Ceritinib inhibits FAK-YB-1 signaling pathway that leads to paclitaxel resistance in all types of TNBC cells. The combination of paclitaxel and ceritinib showed drastic inhibition of tumor growth compared to a single drug alone.  Conclusions:   To improve the response of AR antagonist in AR positive TNBC, we designed a novel combinational strategy comprised of enzalutamide and ceritinib to treat AR+ TNBC tumors through the dual blockade of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent AR signaling pathways. Furthermore, we introduced a novel therapeutic combination of ceritinib and paclitaxel for AR negative or AR-low TNBCs and this combination inhibited tumor growth to a great extent. All agents used in our study are FDA-approved, and thus the proposed combination therapy will likely be useful in the clinic.""","""['Shengli Dong#', 'Hassan Yousefi#', 'Isabella Van Savage', 'Samuel C Okpechi', 'Maryl K Wright', 'Margarite D Matossian', 'Bridgette M Collins-Burow', 'Matthew E Burow', 'Suresh K Alahari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer""","""['PIK3CA mutations in androgen receptor-positive triple negative breast cancer confer sensitivity to the combination of PI3K and androgen receptor inhibitors.', 'Seviteronel, a Novel CYP17 Lyase Inhibitor and Androgen Receptor Antagonist, Radiosensitizes AR-Positive Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'Functional characterization of androgen receptor in two patient-derived xenograft models of triple negative breast cancer.', 'Adaptation to Hypoxia May Promote Therapeutic Resistance to Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor Biology in Triple Negative Breast Cancer: a Case for Classification as AR+ or Quadruple Negative Disease.', 'YB-1 activating cascades as potential targets in KRAS-mutated tumors.']"""

Although the PARP inhibitor olaparib was approved for use in patients with a mutation in one of fourteen genes, the mutation frequency of the genes varies widely in mCRPC and the impact of the less commonly altered genes on PARP inhibitor sensitivity is uncertain. We used functional approaches to directly test the impact of PALB2 and BARD1 loss on homologous recombination (HR) function and PARP inhibitor sensitivity in prostate cancer cell lines.

Herein, TP53 was found to be the most mutated gene in prostate cancer, and missense mutations were the primary mutation type based on bioinformatics data analysis. Subsequently, TP53 rs12947788 mutation site was significant in prostate cancer, and correlated with metastasis and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Furthermore, forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), a target of TP53, was highly expressed in prostate cancer tissue, especially in TP53-mutant patients. It was also associated with patients' Gleason scores and nodal metastasis. Knockdown of FOXA1 suppressed the migration in prostate cancer cells in vitro.

However, little is known about specific factors that support men's adherence to these health behaviour changes, which could inform theory-led diet and PA interventions. We aimed to explore these factors in men following prostatectomy for prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting and participants:   A qualitative study using semistructured interviews with men, who made changes to their diet and/or PA as part of a factorial randomised controlled trial conducted at a single hospital in South West England. Participants were 17 men aged 66 years, diagnosed with localised PCa and underwent prostatectomy. Interview transcripts underwent thematic analysis.  Results:   Men were ambivalent about the relationship of nutrition and PA with PCa risk. They believed their diet and level of PA were reasonable before being randomised to their interventions. Men identified several barriers and facilitators to performing these new behaviours. Barriers included tolerance to dietary changes, PA limitations and external obstacles. Facilitators included partner involvement in diet, habit formation and brisk walking as an individual activity. Men discussed positive effects associated with brisk walking, such as feeling healthier, but not with nutrition interventions.  Conclusions:   The facilitators to behaviour change suggest that adherence to trial interventions can be supported using well-established behaviour change models.

Method:   The study was a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial conducted November 2010 to April 2014 (NCT02053389). Eligible participants were patients from the trial who saw both specialists. The primary outcome was physician recommendations that were scored using an adapted version of the validated PhyReCS coding system. Secondary outcomes included concordance between physician recommendations and the treatment patients received.  Results:   Participants were 108 patients (Mean age 61.9 years; range 43-82; 87% non-Hispanic White). Urologists were more likely to recommend surgery (79% of recommendations) and radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend radiation (68% of recommendations). Recommendations from the urologists and radiation oncologists were concordant for only 33 patients (30.6%). Most patients received a treatment that both physicians recommended (59%); however, 35% received a treatment that only one of their physicians recommended. When discordant, urologists more often recommended surgery and radiation oncologists recommended radiation and surgery as equally appropriate options.  Conclusion:   Urologists and radiation oncologists are more likely to differ than agree in their treatment recommendations for the same patients with clinically localized prostate cancer and more likely to favor treatment aligned with their specialty.

The empirical dietary inflammatory pattern (EDIP), empirical dietary index for hyperinsulinemia (EDIH), and empirical dietary index for insulin resistance (EDIR), and associated lifestyle indices (ELIH, ELIR) predict biomarkers of inflammation (EDIP: IL6, TNFaR2, CRP) and insulin secretion (EDIH/ELIH: c-peptide; EDIR/ELIR: TAG:HDL) from whole foods and behaviors.  Methods:   Associations of these indices with time to prostate cancer progression (primary, n = 2,056) and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM; secondary, n = 2,447) were estimated among men diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer in the Cancer of the Prostate Strategic Urologic Research Endeavor cohort diet and lifestyle sub-study. Because the true (versus clinically documented) date of progression is unobserved, we used parametric (Weibull) survival models to accommodate interval-censoringand estimated adjusted HR and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prostate cancer progression per 1-SD increase in index. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate PCSM associations.  Results:   During a median [interquartile range (IQR)] 6.4 years (IQR, 1.3-12.7), 192 progression and 73 PCSM events were observed. Inflammatory (EDIP: HR, 1.27; CI, 1.17-1.37), hyperinsulinemic (EDIH: HR, 1.24; CI, 1.05-1.46. ELIH: HR, 1.34; CI, 1.17-1.54), and insulin-resistant (EDIR: HR, 1.22; CI, 1.00-1.48. ELIR: HR, 1.36; CI, 1.12-1.64) indices were positively associated with risk of prostate cancer progression. There was no evidence of associations between the indices and PCSM.  Conclusions:   Both inflammatory and insulinemic dietary and lifestyle patterns are associated with risk of prostate cancer progression.  Impact:   For men with prostate cancer, consuming dietary patterns that limit chronic systemic inflammation and insulin hypersecretion may improve survivorship, especially when coupled with active lifestyle and healthy body weight.

Malignant cells have metabolic dependencies distinct from their healthy counterparts, resulting in therapeutic vulnerabilities. Although PTEN and TP53 are the most frequently comutated or codeleted driver genes in lethal CRPC, the metabolic dependencies underlying PTEN/p53 deficiency-driven CRPC for therapeutic intervention remain largely elusive. In this study, PTEN/p53 deficient tumors were determined to be reliant on cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, PTEN/p53 deficiency transcriptionally upregulated squalene epoxidase (SQLE) via activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2). In addition, PTEN deficiency enhanced the protein stability of SQLE by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt/GSK3β-mediated proteasomal pathway. Consequently, SQLE increased cholesterol biosynthesis to facilitate tumor cell growth and survival. Pharmacologic blockade of SQLE with FR194738 profoundly suppressed the invasive program of CRPC. Collectively, these results demonstrate a synergistic relationship between SQLE and PTEN/p53 deficiency in CRPC development and progression. Therefore, pharmacologic interventions targeting SQLE may hold promise for the treatment of patients with CRPC.  Significance:   This study reveals PTEN and p53 deficiency confers a dependence on SQLE-mediated cholesterol metabolism, providing insights for new therapeutic strategies for treating castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Xun Shangguan', 'Zehua Ma', 'Minghao Yu', 'Jie Ding', 'Wei Xue', 'Jun Qi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Reduction of Squalene Epoxidase by Cholesterol Accumulation Accelerates Colorectal Cancer Progression and Metastasis.', 'MiR-205-driven downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis through SQLE-inhibition identifies therapeutic vulnerability in aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Squalene epoxidase-induced cholesteryl ester accumulation promotes nasopharyngeal carcinoma development by activating PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'The shape of human squalene epoxidase expands the arsenal against cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'SQLE promotes pancreatic cancer growth by attenuating ER stress and activating lipid rafts-regulated Src/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Molecular features and predictive models identify the most lethal subtype and a therapeutic target for osteosarcoma.', 'The role of lipid metabolism in tumor immune microenvironment and potential therapeutic strategies.']"""

A previous in vivo study raised the hypothesis that the castration status affects the rate of hematologic AEs. We aimed to investigate the impact of castration status on the incidence of docetaxel-related AE in metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the records of 265 mPCa patients treated with docetaxel, comprising 92 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) and 173 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) between January 2015 and December 2021. Common terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) was applied to evaluate AEs. We analyzed the differential incidences between mHSPC and mCRPC, and risk factors of hematologic and nonhematologic AEs using a logistic regression model.  Results:   The rate of patients who received primary prophylaxis against neutropenia was higher in those with the mHSPC compared with those with the mCRPC (7.5% vs. 33%, p < 0.001). Among the patients without primary prophylaxis, incidence rates of severe neutropenia (CTCAE ≥ Grade3) and FN were 89% and 16% in patients with mCRPC compared to 81% and 18% in those with mHSPC. Logistic regression analysis revealed that age ≥ 75 years and failure to provide primary prophylaxis were independent risk factors of severe neutropenia (odds ratio [OR]: 2.39, 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.10-5.18 and OR: 15.8, 95% CI: 7.23-34.6, respectively). Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS) ≧ 1 was an independent risk factor of FN (OR: 2.26, 95% CI: 1.13-4.54). Castration status (mHSPC vs. mCRPC) was not associated with the risks of severe neutropenia and FN.  Conclusions:   Castration status did not affect the risk of severe neutropenia or FN in mPCa patients treated with docetaxel regardless of the disease state. Failure to provide primary prophylaxis and advanced patient age are independent risk factors of severe neutropenia; while patients with poor PS are more likely to develop FN.

TILs fate and interaction with the tumor microenvironment is mediated by accessory molecules such as CD5 and CD6, two signal-transducing coreceptors involved in fine-tuning of T cell responses. While the nature of the CD5 ligand is still controversial, CD6 binds CD166/ALCAM, a cell adhesion molecule involved in progression and dissemination of epithelial cancers, including PCa. The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of CD5, CD6, and CD166/ALCAM gene variants in PCa.  Methods:   Functionally relevant CD5 (rs2241002 and rs2229177), CD6 (rs17824933, rs11230563, and rs12360861) and CD166/ALCAM (rs6437585, rs579565, rs1044243, and rs35271455) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in germline DNA samples from 376 PCa patients. Their association with PCa prognostic factors, namely biochemical recurrence (BCR) and International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade was analyzed by generalized linear models and survival analyses.  Result:   Proportional hazards regression showed that the minor CD6 rs12360861AA and CD166/ALCAM rs579565AA genotypes were associated with earlier BCR, with hazard ratios of 2.65 (95% CI: 1.39-5.05, p = 0.003) and 1.86, (95% CI: 1.02-3.39, p = 0.043), respectively.

Methods:   A total of 124 patients were included in this multicenter retrospective study. All patients received 177Lu-PSMA and underwent PSMA-PET/CT scans at baseline (bPET) and at 12 weeks (iPET). Imaging responses according to RECIST 1.1, aPCWG3, aPERCIST, PPP, and RECIP 1.0 were interpreted by consensus among three blinded readers. Changes in total tumor burden were obtained using the semi-automatic qPSMA software. The response according to each criterion was classified to progressive disease (PD) vs no-PD. Primary outcome measure was the prognostic value (by Cox regression analysis) for overall survival (OS). Secondary outcome measure was the inter-reader reliability (by Cohen's κ coefficient).

Methods:   Descriptive observational study using microdata from the 2017-2018 Pesquisa de Orçamentos Familiares (Household Budget Survey, POF/IBGE). We initially reviewed programs/policies with specific guarantees of access to medicines in the SUS. Using the pharmaceutical product list of POF-4 (chart 29 of the questionnaire on individual expenditures), we selected the medicines related to these programs. We then described frequencies and percentages for not reporting medicine consumption and for reporting consumption (either through monetary or non-monetary acquisition) according to age and income groups. For medicines with distinctive access guarantees, we compared average monthly values of acquisitions and consumption patterns by age and income.  Results:   63% of those in the ≤ 2 minimum wage (MW) household income group did not report consuming medicines in the last month. Among those earning > 25 MW, 44.3% did not report consumption. Non-monetary acquisitions of medicines were mainly reported for the < 10 MW group and for the elderly and accounted for 20.5% of the total consumption of medicines (in value). For policies with specific access guarantees, non-monetary acquisitions reached 33.6% of total consumption. This percentage varied for the various selected medicines: vaccines, 83.3%; cancer drugs, 70.3%; diabetes, 47.9%; hypertension, 35.9%; asthma and bronchitis, 29.2%; eye problems, 14%; prostate and urinary tract, 10.7%; gynecological, 11.6%; and contraceptives, 9.7%.  Conclusion:   Shares for non-monetary acquisitions of medicines are still low but benefit mainly lower-income and older age groups.

This could decrease diagnostic accuracy of targeted biopsy (TB) since image interpretation can be challenging and requires adequate and supervised training. Therefore we aimed to evaluate the prostate cancer (PCa) detection rate on TB according to mpMRI center's volume and experience.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data of 737 patients who underwent mpMRI-TB at our institution. Patients were stratified according to mpMRI center: Hub (high volume >100 exams/year with dedicated radiologists and supervised training) and Spoke center (low volume <100 exams/year without dedicated radiologists and/or supervised training). Detection rate of PCa at TB and possible predictors of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) at TB. Differences in detection rate were explored using Chi-square test. Predictors of csPCa were evaluated through uni and multivariable logistic regression. The adjustment for casemix included: age, PSA, mpMRI center, lesion's location, PSA density, PI-RADS score and index lesion's size.  Results:   Four hundred forty-nine (60.9%) and 288 (39.1%) patients underwent mpMRI at a Hub or Spoke center, respectively. Hub group had higher detection rate for both any (60.3% vs. 48.1%) and csPCa (46.9% vs 38.7%; all P≤0.001). After stratifying for PI-RADS score, Hub group had higher detection rate for PI-RADS score 3 (csPCA 25.2% vs. 15.7%; p 0.04) and 4 (csPCa 65.7% vs. 45.7%; P=0.001). At multivariable analyses, receiving an mpMRI scan at a Spoke center was an independent predictor for csPCa on TB (OR 0.65; P=0.04).

However, its individual utility as a prognostic marker and the genetic alterations associated with its expression have not been extensively studied in CRPC.  Methods:   This study retrospectively analyzed clinical outcomes and circulating tumor DNA profiles in 163 patients with CRPC and elevated or normal serum CEA. These same patients were then classified as AVPC or non-AVPC and compared to determine the uniqueness of CEA-associated gene alterations.  Results:   Patients with elevated CEA demonstrated higher rates of liver metastasis (37.5% vs. 19.1%, p = 0.02) and decreased median overall survival from CRPC diagnosis (28.7 vs. 73.2 mo, p < 0.0001). In addition, patients with elevated CEA were more likely to harbor copy number amplifications (CNAs) in AR, PIK3CA, MYC, BRAF, CDK6, MET, CCNE1, KIT, RAF1, and KRAS. Based on variant allele frequency we also defined ""clonal"" single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) thought to be driving disease progression in each patient and found that CEA expression was negatively correlated with clonal AR SNVs and positively correlated with clonal TP53 SNVs. Of these genetic associations, only the increases in clonal TP53 SNVs and KRAS amplifications were recapitulated among patients with AVPC when compared to patients without AVPC.

HRR deficiency (HRD) could affect the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), potentially contributing to differential responses to poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Spatial distribution of immune cells in a range of cancers identifies novel disease subtypes and is related to prognosis. In this study we aimed to determine the differences in the TIME of PCa with and without germline (g) HRR mutations.  Methods:   We performed gene expression analysis, multiplex immunohistochemistry of T and B cells and quantitative spatial analysis of PCa samples from 36 patients with gHRD and 26 patients with sporadic PCa. Samples were archival tumor tissue from radical prostatectomies with the exception of one biopsy. Results were validated in several independent cohorts.  Results:   Although the composition of the T cell and B cells was similar in the tumor areas of gHRD-mutated and sporadic tumors, the spatial profiles differed between these cohorts. We describe two T-cell spatial profiles across primary PCa, a clustered immune spatial (CIS) profile characterized by dense clusters of CD4+ T cells closely interacting with PD-L1+ cells, and a free immune spatial (FIS) profile of CD8+ cells in close proximity to tumor cells. gHRD tumors had a more T-cell inflamed microenvironment than sporadic tumors. The CIS profile was mainly observed in sporadic tumors, whereas a FIS profile was enriched in gHRD tumors. A FIS profile was associated with lower Gleason scores, smaller tumors and longer time to biochemical recurrence and metastasis.  Conclusions: gHRD-mutated tumors have a distinct immune microenvironment compared with sporadic tumors. Spatial profiling of T-cells provides additional information beyond T-cell density and is associated with time to biochemical recurrence, time to metastasis, tumor size and Gleason scores.""","""['Anna Sofia Trigos', 'Anupama Pasam', 'Patricia Banks', 'Roslyn Wallace', 'Christina Guo', 'Simon Keam', 'Heather Thorne;kConFab;Catherine Mitchell', 'Stephen Lade', 'David Clouston', 'Alexander Hakansson', 'Yang Liu', 'Benjamin Blyth', 'Declan Murphy', 'Nathan Lawrentschuk', 'Damien Bolton', 'Daniel Moon', 'Phil Darcy', 'Ygal Haupt', 'Scott G Williams', 'Elena Castro', 'David Olmos', 'David Goode', 'Paul Neeson', 'Shahneen Sandhu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Association between pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA2 and ATM and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary prostate cancer.', 'Homologous recombination deficiency is inversely correlated with microsatellite instability and identifies immunologically cold tumors in most cancer types.', 'Homologous recombination repair deficient prostate cancer represents an immunologically distinct subtype.', 'Homologous recombination repair deficiency as a predictive biomarker : Basic mechanisms and detection methods.', 'The emerging role of homologous recombination repair and PARP inhibitors in genitourinary malignancies.', 'A necroptosis gene signature predicts prostate cancer recurrence, and is linked to somatic mutation, therapeutic landscape, and immune infiltration.', 'Spatial analysis with SPIAT and spaSim to characterize and simulate tissue microenvironments.', 'Roles of the PARP Inhibitor in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Pathogenic Mutated Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Direct Functions and Modification of the Tumor Microenvironment.', 'Single-cell omics traces the heterogeneity of prostate cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment.', 'Clinical Application of Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer.']"""

In many non-prostate solid tumors such as HCC, prostate-specific membrane antigens (PSMA) are overexpressed in tumor-associated endothelial cells. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET imaging on HCC with different animal models, including cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) and patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and to explore its mechanisms of function.  Methods:   [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 was prepared. The expression level of PSMA in two human hepatocellular cancer cells (HepG2 and HuH-7) was evaluated, and the cellular uptakes of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 were assayed. HepG2 and HuH-7 subcutaneous xenograft models, HepG2 orthotopic xenograft models, and four different groups of PDX models were prepared. Preclinical pharmacokinetics and performance of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 were evaluated in different types of HCC xenografts models using small animal PET and biodistribution studies.  Results:   Low PSMA expression level of HepG2 and HuH-7 cells was observed, and the cellular uptake and blocking study confirmed the non-specificity of the PSMA-targeted probe binding to HepG2 and HuH-7 cells. In the subcutaneous xenograft models, the tumor uptakes at 0.5 h were 0.76 ± 0.12%ID/g (HepG2 tumors) and 0.78 ± 0.08%ID/g (HuH-7 tumors), respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the blocking groups (0.23 ± 0.04%ID/g and 0.20 ± 0.04%ID/g, respectively). In the orthotopic xenograft models, PET images clearly displayed the tumor locations based on the preferential accumulation of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 in tumor tissue versus normal liver tissue, suggesting the possibility of using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET imaging to detect primary HCC lesions in deep tissue. In the four different groups of HCC PDX models, PET imaging with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 provided clear tumor uptakes with prominent tumor-to-background contrast, further demonstrating its potential for the clinical imaging of PSMA-positive HCC lesions. The staining of tumor tissue sections with CD31- and PSMA-specific antibodies visualized the tumor-associated blood vessels and PSMA expression on endothelial cells in subcutaneous, orthotopic tissues, and PDX tissues, confirming the imaging with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 might be mediated by targeting tumor associated endothelium.  Conclusion:   In this study, in vivo PET on different types of HCC xenograft models illustrated high uptake within tumors, which confirmed that [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET may be a promising imaging modality for HCC by targeting tumor associated endothelium.""","""['Qiaomiao Lu', 'Yu Long', 'Kevin Fan', 'Zhiwen Shen', 'Yongkang Gai', 'Qingyao Liu', 'Dawei Jiang', 'Weibo Cai', 'Chidan Wan', 'Xiaoli Lan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['PSMA-targeted theranostics of solid tumors: applications beyond prostate cancers.', 'The era of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based theranostics for hepatocellular carcinoma is upcoming: are we ready for it?', 'Letter to the editor regarding ""PET imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting tumor‑associated endothelium using 68\xa0GaGa‑PSMA‑617"".', 'Validation and utility of HepG2 xenograft model for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Effects of Linker Modification on Tumor-to-Kidney Contrast of 68Ga-Labeled PSMA-Targeted Imaging Probes.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Development of a Ga-68 labeled PET tracer with short linker for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) as a potential target for molecular imaging and treatment in bone and soft tissue sarcomas.', 'Overview of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-Targeting Radiolabelled Imaging Probes from Preclinical Perspective: Lessons Learned and Road Ahead.', 'Preclinical evaluation of 68Ga-radiolabeled trimeric affibody for PDGFRβ-targeting PET imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Comparison between PSMA PET/CT and MRI for Characterizing Hepatocellular carcinoma: A Real-World Study.', 'The era of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based theranostics for hepatocellular carcinoma is upcoming: are we ready for it?', 'PSMA-targeted theranostics of solid tumors: applications beyond prostate cancers.']"""

Methods:   A primary cohort of 474 patients with PCa who underwent prostate mpMRI were retrospectively enrolled for PLNM prediction between January 2017 and January 2020. They were then randomly split into training/validation (n = 332) and test (n = 142) groups for model development and internal testing. Four radiomics models were developed using four masks (manually corrected/automatic prostate gland and PCa lesion segmentation) based on the ADC maps using the primary cohort. Another cohort of 128 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) for PCa was used as the testing cohort between February 2020 and October 2021. The performance of the models was evaluated in terms of discrimination and clinical usefulness using the area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). The optimal radiomics model was further compared with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and Briganti 2017 nomograms, and PI-RADS assessment.  Results:   17 (13.28%) Patients with PLNM were included in the testing cohort. The radiomics model based on the mask of automatically segmented prostate obtained the highest AUC among the four radiomics models (0.73 vs. 0.63 vs. 0.70 vs. 0.56). Briganti 2017, MSKCC nomograms, and PI-RADS assessment-yielded AUCs of 0.69, 0.71, and 0.70, respectively, and no significant differences were found compared with the optimal radiomics model (P = 0.605-0.955).

We present a pilot study in which abiraterone dosing is guided by evolution-informed mathematical models to delay onset of resistance.  Methods:   In the study cohort, abiraterone was stopped when PSA was <50% of pretreatment value and resumed when PSA returned to baseline. Results are compared to a contemporaneous cohort who had >50% PSA decline after initial abiraterone administration and met trial eligibility requirements but chose standard of care (SOC) dosing.  Results:   17 subjects were enrolled in the adaptive therapy group and 16 in the SOC group. All SOC subjects have progressed, but four patients in the study cohort remain stably cycling (range 53-70 months). The study cohort had significantly improved median time to progression (TTP; 33.5 months; p<0.001) and median overall survival (OS; 58.5 months; hazard ratio, 0.41, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-0.83, p<0.001) compared to 14.3 and 31.3 months in the SOC cohort. On average, study subjects received no abiraterone during 46% of time on trial. Longitudinal trial data demonstrated the competition coefficient ratio (αRS/αSR) of sensitive and resistant populations, a critical factor in intratumoral evolution, was two- to threefold higher than pre-trial estimates. Computer simulations of intratumoral evolutionary dynamics in the four long-term survivors found that, due to the larger value for αRS/αSR, cycled therapy significantly decreased the resistant population. Simulations in subjects who progressed predicted further increases in OS could be achieved with prompt abiraterone withdrawal after achieving 50% PSA reduction.  Conclusions:   Incorporation of evolution-based mathematical models into abiraterone monotherapy for mCRPC significantly increases TTP and OS. Computer simulations with updated parameters from longitudinal trial data can estimate intratumoral evolutionary dynamics in each subject and identify strategies to improve outcomes.

In patients with prostate cancer, the rates of detecting suspicious lesions by 68Ga-NGUL PET/CT and conventional imaging (CT and bone scintigraphy) during the screening period, within one month after recruitment, were compared.  Results:   All 12 participants (six healthy adults aged 31-32 years and six prostate cancer patients aged 57-81 years) completed the clinical trial. No drug-related adverse events were observed. In the healthy adult group, 68Ga-NGUL was rapidly distributed, with the highest uptake in the kidneys. The median effective dose coefficient was calculated as 0.025 mSv/MBq, and cumulative activity in the bladder had the highest contribution. In patients with metastatic prostate cancer, 229 suspicious lesions were detected using either 68Ga-NGUL PET/CT or conventional imaging. Among them, 68Ga-NGUL PET/CT detected 199 (86.9%) lesions and CT or bone scintigraphy detected 114 (49.8%) lesions.  Conclusion: 68Ga-NGUL can be safely applied clinically and has shown a higher detection rate for the localization of metastatic lesions in prostate cancer than conventional imaging. Therefore, 68Ga-NGUL is a valuable option for prostate cancer imaging.""","""['Minseok Suh', 'Hyun Gee Ryoo', 'Keon Wook Kang', 'Jae Min Jeong', 'Chang Wook Jeong', 'Cheol Kwak', 'Gi Jeong Cheon']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Korean J Radiol""","""['Head-to-Head Comparison of 68Ga-NOTA (68Ga-NGUL) and 68Ga-PSMA-11 in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Cold Kit for Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) PET Imaging: Phase 1 Study of 68Ga-Tris(Hydroxypyridinone)-PSMA PET/CT in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Head-To-Head Comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy for the Detection of Bone Metastases in Patients With Prostate Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.', 'The Application of Radiolabeled Targeted Molecular Probes for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""
