From 2012 to 2020, 215 patients were identified for this study and 17 were treated in the salvage settings after HIFU. The median follow-up time was 34.5 months (range: 7-102 months, inter-quartile range [IQR]: 16-64 months). Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events were evaluated in acute and late periods with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5, and the rates of biochemical-clinical failure free survival (BCFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated. The cumulative incidence of late GU Grade 2 or greater toxicity after five years was significantly different between the non-HIFU and HIFU cohorts with rates of 7.3% and 26.2%, respectively (P = 0.03). Regarding GI Grade 2 or greater toxicity, there was no significant difference between the two cohorts. The 5y-BCFS was 84.2% in the non-HIFU cohort and 69.5% in the HIFU cohort with no significant difference (P = 0.10) and the 5y-OS was 95.9% and 92.3%, respectively (P = 0.47). We concluded that the possibility of increased late GU Grade 2 or greater should be considered when applying salvage radiotherapy for local recurrence after HIFU.""","""['Toshihisa Kuroki', 'Sunao Shoji', 'Toyoaki Uchida', 'Takeshi Akiba', 'Shigeto Kabuki', 'Ryuta Nagao', 'Tsuyoshi Fukuzawa', 'Yoshitsugu Matsumoto', 'Tomomi Katsumata', 'Natsumi Futakami', 'Tatsuya Mikami', 'Yoji Nakano', 'Yuri Toyoda', 'Tsuyoshi Takazawa', 'Etsuo Kunieda', 'Akitomo Sugawara']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Radiat Res""","""['11C choline PET guided salvage radiotherapy with volumetric modulation arc therapy and hypofractionation for recurrent prostate cancer after HIFU failure: preliminary results of tolerability and acute toxicity.', 'Salvage Radiotherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer after High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Therapy: Quality of Life and Functional Outcome.', 'Proton Therapy as Salvage Treatment for Local Relapse of Prostate Cancer Following Cryosurgery or High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound.', 'Systematic review of the efficacy and safety of high-intensity focussed ultrasound for the primary and salvage treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Salvage radiotherapy following HiFU: An institutional series and literature review.']"""

The underlying mechanism is not a direct spread but could be hormonal, caused by active proteins or peptides secreted by malignant cells such as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). They also can be autoimmune, caused by crossreacting antibodies or immune cells produced in the human body in response to malignant tumors, such as Lambert Eaton syndrome, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and limbic encephalitis. They can also be related to cytokines produced by tumor cells or the immune system. Paraneoplastic syndromes can occur with multiple types of malignancies, including but not limited to breast cancer, small cell lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, mesothelioma, renal cell carcinoma, and multiple other malignancies.    Clinicians need to be familiar with the presentations of paraneoplastic syndromes as they can be the first presenting symptoms of an underlying malignancy. Failure to identify these syndromes may result in delayed diagnosis of cancer and poor clinical outcomes. These syndromes are not directly related to tumor invasion, metastatic disease symptoms, or due to adverse treatment effects.   Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are a unique subset of paraneoplastic syndromes. Caused by cross-reactive antibodies called onconeural antibodies, these are antibodies produced by the immune system in response to malignant tumors. These onconeural antibodies can attack different parts of the nervous system resulting in various neurological manifestations.   Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is one of the more commonly seen paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. It is caused by immune-mediated injury to cerebellar Purkinje cells. It is associated with multiple malignancies but, most commonly, breast and pelvic malignancies. PCD has also been reported in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and small cell lung cancer. PCD can progress rapidly over a few weeks and can result in severe disability.""","""['Ragia Aly', 'Prabhu D.

However, after a certain period of therapy, primary PCa inevitably progresses into castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Enzalutamide (Enz) is an androgen receptor (AR) signal inhibitor which can delay the progression of CRPC and increase survival of patients with metastatic CRPC. However, the mechanisms involved in enzalutamide-resistant (EnzR) CRPC are still controversial. In the study, we used bioinformatic methods to find potential genes that correlated with the occurrence of EnzR CRPC.  Methods:   We collected RNA sequencing data of the EnzR CRPC cell line LNCaP (EnzR LNCaP) from GSE44905, GSE78201, and GSE150807. We found the hub genes from the three datasets. Then we tested the expression of the hub genes in different databases and the potential drugs that can affect the hub genes. Finally, we verified the hub gene expression and drug function.  Results:   From GSE44905, GSE78201 and GSE150807, we found 45 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between LNCaP and EnzR LNCaP. Ten hub genes were found in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The expression of hub gene and survival analysis were analyzed by different databases. We found that cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) was highly expressed in both the EnzR LNCaP cell and PCa patients. Ten potential small molecules could suppress CDK6 expression as per ""CLUE COMMAND"" findings. Finally, we found the expression of CDK6 increased in both PCa patients' samples, CRPC and EnzR PCa cell lines. Three potential CDK6 inhibitors, namely apigenin, chrysin and fisetin, can decrease cell proliferation.  Conclusions:   The study proved that the abnormal overexpression of CDK6 may be a reason behind EnzR CRPC occurrence and suppression CDK6 expression may help treat EnzR CRPC.""","""['Xi Chen#', 'Yechen Wu#', 'Xinan Wang', 'Chengdang Xu', 'Licheng Wang', 'Jingang Jian', 'Denglong Wu', 'Gang Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Med Res""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9Â® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Preclinical studies using cisplatin/carboplatin to restore the Enzalutamide sensitivity via degrading the androgen receptor splicing variant 7 (ARv7) to further suppress Enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer.', 'ISL1 promotes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) through epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT).', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'The Crucial Role of AR-V7 in Enzalutamide-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of key enzalutamide-resistance-related genes in castration-resistant prostate cancer and verification of RAD51 functions.', 'Plasmatic MicroRNAs and Treatment Outcomes of Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Hospital-Based Cohort Study and In Silico Analysis.', 'CCNB1 and AURKA are critical genes for prostate cancer progression and castration-resistant prostate cancer resistant to vinblastine.']"""

Objective:   To determine whether radical local therapy (RLT) improves survival for men with oligometastatic prostate cancer (OMPCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   This open-label randomized controlled trial included patients with newly diagnosed OMPCa defined as five or fewer bone or extrapelvic lymph node metastases and no visceral metastases.  Intervention:   Patients were randomly allocated to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or ADT and RLT. Men allocated RLT received either cytoreductive radical prostatectomy (RP) or prostate radiation therapy (RT) with a radical dose schedule.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). Secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival.  Results and limitations:   Between September 2015 and March 2019, 200 patients were randomized, with 100 men allocated to each group. The median age was 68 yr and the median PSA at diagnosis was 99 ng/ml. In the study group, 96 patients underwent RLT (85 RP and 11 RT). In the control group, 17 patients eventually received RLT (15 RP and two RT). All patients were included for an intention-to-treat analysis. After a median follow-up of -48 mo, the median rPFS was not reached in the study group and was 40 mo in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27-0.70; p = 0.001). The 3-yr OS rate was 88% for the study group and 70% for the control group (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.81; p = 0.008).  Conclusions:   Men with newly diagnosed OMPCa who received ADT plus RLT (mainly prostatectomy) had significantly higher rates of rPFS and OS than those who received ADT alone.

A major task in microarray data processing is gene selection, which aims to find a subset of genes with the least inner similarity and most relevant to the target class. Removing unnecessary, redundant, or noisy data reduces the data dimensionality. This research advocates a graph theoretic-based gene selection method for cancer diagnosis. Both unsupervised and supervised modes use well-known and successful social network approaches such as the maximum weighted clique criterion and edge centrality to rank genes. The suggested technique has two goals: (i) to maximize the relevancy of the chosen genes with the target class and (ii) to reduce their inner redundancy. A maximum weighted clique is chosen in a repetitive way in each iteration of this procedure. The appropriate genes are then chosen from among the existing features in this maximum clique using edge centrality and gene relevance. In the experiment, several datasets consisting of Colon, Leukemia, SRBCT, Prostate Tumor, and Lung Cancer, with different properties, are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed model. Our performance is compared to that of renowned filter-based gene selection approaches for cancer diagnosis whose results demonstrate a clear superiority.""","""['Saeid Azadifar', 'Mehrdad Rostami', 'Kamal Berahmand', 'Parham Moradi', 'Mourad Oussalah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['Gene selection for microarray data classification via multi-objective graph theoretic-based method.', 'SVM-RFE with MRMR filter for gene selection.', 'Recursive gene selection based on maximum margin criterion: a comparison with SVM-RFE.', 'Filter versus wrapper gene selection approaches in DNA microarray domains.', 'Graph- and rule-based learning algorithms: a comprehensive review of their applications for cancer type classification and prognosis using genomic data.', 'A Two-Phase Feature Selection Method for Identifying Influential Spreaders of Disease Epidemics in Complex Networks.', 'Data mining techniques in breast cancer diagnosis at the cellular-molecular level.', 'Comparison of cancer subtype identification methods combined with feature selection methods in omics data analysis.', 'An interaction and feedback mechanism-based group decision-making for emergency medical supplies supplier selection using T-spherical fuzzy information.', 'Optimal Feature Selection-Based Dental Caries Prediction Model Using Machine Learning for Decision Support System.']"""

In this study, we develop a robust and efficient analytical system, the aptamer-based chemiluminescent optical fiber immunosensor (aptamer-COFIS), for ultrasensitive detection of biomarkers. In the aptamer-COFIS system, target aptamer-primer probe is used as the bridge to combine antibody-antigen immunoreaction on the fiber surface with chemiluminescent signal amplification. The antibody-antigen (target)-aptamer sandwich-like reaction is coupled with rolling cycle amplification (RCA), which is capable to produce hundreds of binding sites to connect with the streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase nanocomposites for signal amplification. Using prostate specific antigen (PSA), the most reliable and specific biomarker of prostate cancer, as the test sample, we show that the proposed strategy can greatly improve the sensor response with a wide linear range of 0.01-1000 pg/mL and an extremely low limit-of-detection of 3.2 fg/mL. Our results indicate that the proposed method presents high selectivity and good accuracy for ultrasensitive sensing biomarkers in complex clinical samples. Moreover, with additional advantages by using optical fiber as the ideal carrier of biorecognition elements and the transducer of chemiluminescent signal, the aptamer-COFIS system with a low-cost compact design is convenient for operation, making it suitable for cost-effective on-site and real time analysis of various biomarkers in early diagnosis of diseases.""","""['Siqi Zhao', 'Jingwen Huang', 'Dingsong Li', 'Li Yang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Ultrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor for PSA biomarker detection in prostate cancer cells using gold nanoparticles/PAMAM dendrimer loaded with enzyme linked aptamer as integrated triple signal amplification strategy.', 'Ultrasensitive detection of prostate specific antigen using a personal glucose meter based on DNA-mediated immunoreaction.', 'Cascade Signal Amplification Based on Copper Nanoparticle-Reported Rolling Circle Amplification for Ultrasensitive Electrochemical Detection of the Prostate Cancer Biomarker.', 'An amplified comparative fluorescence resonance energy transfer immunosensing of CA125 tumor marker and ovarian cancer cells using green and economic carbon dots for bio-applications in labeling, imaging and sensing.', 'Chemiluminescent Optical Fiber Immunosensor Combining Surface Modification and Signal Amplification for Ultrasensitive Determination of Hepatitis B Antigen.', 'Recent Advancements of LSPR Fiber-Optic Biosensing: Combination Methods, Structure, and Prospects.']"""

Molnupiravir is a new oral antiviral for treating COVID-19 in outpatient settings. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness profile of molnupiravir versus best supportive care in the treatment of adult patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 at risk of progression to severe disease, from a US payer's perspective.  Methods:   The model was developed using a decision tree for the short-term acute phase of COVID-19 and a Markov state transition model for the long-term post-acute phase. This model compared molnupiravir with best supportive care as consistent with the MOVe-OUT trial. Costs were reported in 2021 US dollars. Transition probabilities were derived from the phase III MOVe-OUT trial and the TriNetX real-world electronic health records database. Costs were derived from the TriNetX database and utility values from a de novo, vignette-based utility study. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA/PSA) were conducted. Primary outcomes included proportion hospitalized, proportion who died overall and by highest healthcare setting at the end of the acute phase, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY gained over a lifetime (100 years) horizon, discounted at 3% annually and assessed at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY.  Results:   In this model, the use of molnupiravir led to an increase in QALYs (0.210) and decrease in direct total medical costs (-$895) per patient across a lifetime horizon, compared with best supportive care in COVID-19 outpatients. Molnupiravir was the dominant intervention when compared with best supportive care. Patients treated with molnupiravir were less likely to be hospitalized (6.38% vs. 9.20%) and more likely to remain alive (99.88% vs. 98.71%) during the acute phase. Through DSA, molnupiravir treatment effect of hospitalization reduction was identified to be the most influential parameter, and through PSA, molnupiravir remained dominant in 84% of the total simulations and, overall, 100% cost effective.  Conclusion:   This analysis suggests that molnupiravir is cost effective compared with best supportive care for the treatment of adult outpatients with COVID-19. However, our study was limited by the unavailability of the most recent information on the rapidly evolving pandemic, including new viral variants, patient populations affected, and changes in standards of care. Further research should explore the impact of vaccination on the cost effectiveness of molnupiravir and other therapies, based on real-world data, to account for these changes, including the impact of vaccination and immunity.""","""['Hardik Goswami', 'Adnan Alsumali', 'Yiling Jiang', 'Matthias Schindler', 'Elizabeth R Duke', 'Joshua Cohen', 'Andrew Briggs', 'Amy Puenpatom']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pharmacoeconomics""","""['Correction to: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Molnupiravir Versus Best Supportive Care for the Treatment of Outpatient COVID-19 in Adults in the US.', 'Adefovir dipivoxil and pegylated interferon alfa-2a for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of KTE-X19 for Adults with Relapsed/Refractory B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in the United States.', 'The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronisation (biventricular pacing) for heart failure: systematic review and economic model.', 'Multi-gene Pharmacogenomic Testing That Includes Decision-Support Tools to Guide Medication Selection for Major Depression: A Health Technology Assessment.', 'Cost-effectiveness of gilteritinib for relapsed/refractory FLT3mut+ acute myeloid leukemia.', 'A sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous assay and trace level genotoxic impurities quantification of SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor-Molnupiravir in its pure and formulation dosage forms using fractional factorial design.', 'Drug treatment of COVID-19 infection.', 'Therapeutic potential of compounds targeting SARS-CoV-2 helicase.', 'Early Treatment with Fluvoxamine among Patients with COVID-19: A Cost-Consequence Model.']"""

Results:   Length of stay >2days and readmission following RP was 10.8% and 5.5% for patients with HR or higher CaP. Median time to progression was 3.9 months (IQR:1.6-13.9), and 2-year progression-free probability was 67% for HR, 53% for VHR, 51% for cN1Many, and 58% for cN0M1. In multivariable analysis, VHR (hazard ratio:1.70; P < 0.0001) and cN1Many (1.96, P < 0.0001) were highly significant predictors of progression, while cN0M1 was not (P = 0.54), compared with non-metastatic HR CaP. Limitations include selection biases and imprecision of imaging methodologies.  Conclusions:   Most patients with HR or higher CaP remain progression-free 2 years after RP, with acceptable perioperative outcomes. Progression-free survival was similar in cN1 and VHR patients, better with non-metastatic HR CaP, and between these for cN0M1 patients indicating the imprecise clinical staging occurring with conventional imaging modalities alone.""","""['Silvia Mora', 'Ji Qi', 'Todd M Morgan', 'Christopher M Brede', 'James Peabody', 'Arvin George', 'Brian R Lane']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Preoperative characteristics of high-Gleason disease predictive of favourable pathological and clinical outcomes at radical prostatectomy.', 'Neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy combined with radical prostatectomy and extended PLND for very high risk locally advanced prostate cancer: A retrospective comparative study.', 'Oncologic outcome of radical prostatectomy versus radiotherapy as primary treatment for high and very high risk localized prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Prostate-specific Antigen Persistence After Radical Prostatectomy for the Prediction of Clinical Progression and Cancer-specific Mortality in Node-positive Prostate Cancer Patients.', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   A total of 188 patients underwent 1.5-T mp-MRI after RP before RT. Patients were divided into two groups: with biochemical recurrence (group A) and without but with high risk of local recurrence (group B). Continuous variables were compared between two groups using T-Student; categoric variables were analyzed using Pearson chi-square. ROC analysis was performed considering PSA before RT, ISUP, pT and pN as grouping variables.  Results:   PCa recurrence (reduction of PSA levels after RT) was 89.8% in the group A and 80.3% in the group B. Comparing patients with and without PCa recurrence, there was a significant difference in PSA values before RT for group A and for PSA values before RT and after RT for group B. In group A, there was a significant correlation between PSA before RT and diameter of recurrence and between PSA before RT and time spent before recurrence. The mp-MRI diagnostic accuracy in detecting PCa local recurrence after RP is of 62.2% in group A and 38% in group B. DWI is the most specific MRI-sequence and DCE the most sensitive. For PSA = 0.5 ng/ml, the AUC decreases while sensitivity and accuracy increase for each MRI-sequence. For PSA = 0.9 ng/ml, DCE-AUC increases significantly.  Conclusion:   mp-MRI should always be performed before RT when a recurrence is suspected.

Standard dosing often requires dose reduction because of side effects. There is no information on survival outcomes with lower doses. We investigated the impact of starting enzalutamide at â¤ 50% dose on metastatic prostate cancer outcomes including patients' longevity.  Patients and methods:   Records of metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with enzalutamide at one center were retrospectively reviewed. Low-dose enzalutamide (â¤80 mg/day) was compared with standard-dose (160 mg/day). The primary objective was to compute the restricted mean survival time (RMST - time scale) and restricted mean attained age (RMAA - age scale) using the Irwin method. Secondary objectives included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and PSA progression per PCWG3 criteria (PSA PFS). We used the logrank test and the â difference between RMSTs for comparison.  Results:   Of 111 patients treated, 32 received a low-dose and 79 the standard-dose. Low-dose patients had less prior abiraterone or chemotherapy (28.1% vs. 65.8%, P < .001); more testosterone assessment (65.6% vs. 40.5%, P = .016); poorer ECOG performance status (48.3% score â¥2 vs. 26.6%; P = .040), more comorbidities (75.9% vs. 46.3%; P = .010)) including increased cardiovascular disease (51.7% vs. 21.4%, P = .004). Baseline PSA value and doubling time at start of enzalutamide and distribution of metastases were similar between the groups. OS and PFS did not differ between low-dose and standard-dose. Patients on low-dose had a better longevity with significantly longer RMAA, 89.1 years, versus standard-dose RMAA of 83.8 years (â = 5.3 years, P = .003, logrank P = .025). In a subgroup analysis by age at start of enzalutamide, <75 versus â¥75 years old, longevity was also better with low-dose in younger patients (â = 2.9 years, P = .034, and older, â = 3.3 years, P = .011).

In this paper, we reconnoitered the roles of circRNA pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component X (circPDHX) in PCa.  Methods:   The circPDHX, microRNA (miR)-497-5p and acyl-CoA synthetase long chain family member 1 (ACSL1) contents were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Cell proliferation was measured by cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and colony formation assay. Cell migration was examined by wound healing assay. The apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry assay. The ELISA kits were applied to quantify the fatty acid metabolites. Furthermore, the interplay between miR-497-5p and circPDHX or ACSL1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay. The role of circPDHX in PCa was supplementary substantiated in vivo.  Results:   CircPDHX and ACSL1 contents were upregulated, and the miR-497-5p level was downregulated in PCa. CircPDHX deficiency attenuated PCa cell proliferation, migration, and fatty acid metabolites, while intensified cell apoptosis. CircPDHX bound to miR-497-5p to adjust ACSL1. Moreover, miR-497-5p inhibited the PCa progression by regulating ACSL1. In the meantime, circPDHX deficiency repressed PCa tumor growth in vivo.  Conclusion:   CircPDHX stimulated PCa development via miR-497-5p/ACSL1, which presented a new thought for PCa treatment.""","""['Jia Chen', 'Qitong Xie', 'Weixian Miao', 'Jianrui Fan', 'Xiaobo Zhou', 'Maozhang Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Circ_0044516 Enriches the Level of SARM1 as a miR-330-5p Sponge to Regulate Cell Malignant Behaviors and Tumorigenesis of Prostate Cancer.', 'CircLRP6 contributes to prostate cancer growth and metastasis by binding to miR-330-5p to up-regulate NRBP1.', 'Exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer via the microRNA-136-5p/tribbles homolog 1 pathway.', 'Circular RNA LPAR3 targets JPT1 via microRNA-513b-5p to facilitate glycolytic activation but repress prostate cancer radiosensitivity.', 'Circ_0076305 facilitates prostate cancer development via sponging miR-411-5p and regulating PGK1.', 'Expression of SPAG7 and its regulatory microRNAs in seminal plasma and seminal plasma-derived extracellular vesicles of patients with subfertility.', 'Expression characteristics of circular RNA in human traumatic brain injury.', 'Sanguinarine promotes apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells via regulating the miR-497-5p/CDK4 axis.']"""

However, patients receiving enzalutamide frequently develop drug resistance. Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) is a shrub-like leguminous fynbos plant endemic to the Cedarberg Mountains area in South Africa. We evaluated the possibility of using a pharmaceutical-grade green rooibos extract (GRT, containing 12.78% aspalathin) to suppress the proliferation and survival of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Treatment with GRT dose-dependently suppressed the proliferation, survival, and colony formation of enzalutamide-resistant C4-2 MDV3100r cells and PC-3 cells. Non-cancerous human cells were more resistant to GRT treatment. GRT suppressed the expression of proteins involved in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling, androgen receptor (AR), phospho-AR (Ser81), cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), c-Myc and Bcl-2 but increased the expression of apoptotic proteins. Overexpression of c-Myc antagonized the suppressive effects of GRT, while knockdown of c-Myc increased the sensitivity of PCa cells to GRT treatment. Expression level of c-Myc correlated to resistance of PCa cells to GRT treatment. Additionally, immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that GRT reduced the abundance of AR proteins both in nucleus and cytoplasm. Treatment with cycloheximide revealed that GRT reduced the stability of AR. GRT suppressed protein expression of AR and AR's downstream target prostate specific antigen (PSA) in C4-2 MDV3100r cells. Interestingly, we observed that AR proteins accumulate in nucleus and PSA expression is activated in the AR-positive enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells even in the absence of androgen. Our results suggested that GRT treatment suppressed the cell proliferation and survival of enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells via inhibition of c-Myc, induction of apoptosis, as well as the suppression of expression, signaling and stability of AR.

Mapping algorithms were estimated using ordinary least squares regression models through five-fold cross-validation in baseline cross-sectional data and combined longitudinal data from all assessment periods; random effects specifications were also estimated in longitudinal data. Predictive performance was compared using root mean square error. Longitudinal predictive ability of models obtained using baseline data was examined using mean absolute differences in the reported and predicted utilities.  Results:   A total of 267 (and 199) patients in the estimation sample had complete EQ-5D and EPIC domain (and subdomain) data at baseline and at all subsequent assessments. Ordinary least squares models using combined data showed better predictive ability (lowest root mean square error) in the validation phase for algorithms with EPIC domain/subdomain data alone, whereas models using baseline data outperformed other specifications in the validation phase when patient covariates were also modeled. The mean absolute differences were lower for models using EPIC subdomain data compared with EPIC domain data and generally decreased as the time of assessment increased.

This is associated with poor outcomes in prostate cancer. We hypothesized that inheritance of the HSD3B1 adrenal permissive genotype would similarly negatively impact breast cancer outcomes.  Patients and methods:   Germline HSD3B1 was sequenced in 644 postmenopausal women diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 with stage I-III estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2/neu-negative (HER2-) breast cancer enrolled in a population-based study in western Washington. Primary endpoint was distant metastatic recurrence according to genotype. Secondary endpoint was breast cancer-specific survival. Hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using cause-specific Cox regression accounting for competing risks.  Results:   Adrenal restrictive genotype (homozygous wild type) was most prevalent (47%), followed by heterozygous (44%) and adrenal permissive (9%). There were no significant differences comparing demographic, tumor, or treatment characteristics apart from higher frequency of adrenal permissive genotype among non-Hispanic white participants (p = 0.04). After accounting for competing risks, the cumulative incidence of distant metastatic recurrence (15 events) was significantly higher among participants with adrenal permissive compared with the adrenal restrictive genotype (HR 4.9, 95% CI 1.32-18.4, p = 0.02). The adrenal permissive genotype was also predictive of breast cancer-specific mortality (HR 3.5, 95% CI 1.27-9.59, p = 0.02).

However, the benefit of gomisin A is still not well understood. The action of gomisin A is diverse. However, the effect of gomisin A on Ca2+ signaling in prostate cancer cells is unknown. Ca2+ is a pivotal second envoy that triggers and regulates cellular processes such as apoptosis, fertilization, energy transduction, secretion, and protein activation. The goal of this study was to explore the action of gomisin A on [Ca2+]i and cytotoxicity in PC3 prostate cancer cells. Gomisin A at 100-200 Î¼M provoked [Ca2+]i raises. 20% of the response was reduced by removing external Ca2+. The Ca2+ influx provoked by gomisin A was suppressed by 20% by store-caused Ca2+ entry suppressors: econazole, SKF96365, nifedipine; also by phorbol 12-myristate 13 acetate and GF109203X.

Pepsinogen test positivity (PG+) has been evaluated as a promising screening test among Asian and European populations; however, its utility in multiethnic U.S. populations is poorly described. In this case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, In and colleagues evaluate the discrimination of PG+ in serum collected from individuals prior to the development of gastric cancer. The authors find that PG+ individuals were at nearly 10-fold increased risk for developing gastric cancer, and this effect remained robust after adjusting for Helicobacter pylori status, family history, education, smoking, and obesity. In subgroup analysis, the predictive ability of the test was particularly robust for noncardia gastric cancers, and nonpredictive of cardia gastric cancers. Serum pepsinogen testing holds promise as a noninvasive screening strategy to triage individuals at heightened risk for gastric cancer, and may help to improve early diagnosis in the United States.

In this novel 16-week pilot study, we examined the effect of a circuit-based aerobic and resistance exercise intervention on self-reported sleep quality in breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors and explored the association between changes in sleep quality and insulin resistance.  Methods:   Survivors of breast, prostate or colorectal cancers who were sedentary, overweight or obese (BMI>25.0 kg/m2) were randomized to exercise (n=60) or usual care (n=30). The 16-week intervention included supervised moderate-vigorous aerobic (65-85% of VO2max) and resistance (65-85% of 1-repetition maximum) exercise performed in a circuit, interval fashion three times per week. Patient-reported sleep quality and insulin resistance were assessed at baseline and post-intervention using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Homeostasis Model of Assessment (HOMA-IR), respectively. Mean changes in PSQI score that are negative demonstrate improvements in sleep. Between-group differences were determined using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Associations between changes in PSQI and insulin resistance were computed using Pearson correlations.  Results:   Participants were 63.2Â±10.8 years old, obese (87%), female (55%), and completed chemotherapy + radiation therapy (75%). Adherence to the intervention was 92% and the retention rate was 100%. Post-intervention, the PSQI global score improved significantly in the exercise group when compared to usual care (mean between-group difference, -2.7; 95% CI, -4.2 to -0.6). Change in PSQI was inversely associated with change in HOMA-IR (r=-0.91; p<0.01) among the exercise group.

Methods:   Trend partitioning was applied to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program data for 1973-2016.  Results:   Growth of cancer prevalence in older adults decelerated or even decreased over time for all studied cancers due to decreasing incidence and improving survival for most of cancers, with a smaller contribution of the stage at cancer diagnosis. Changes in the prevalence of cancers of the lung, colon, stomach, and breast were predominantly due to decreasing incidence, increasing survival and more frequent diagnoses at earlier stages. Changes in prevalence of some other cancers demonstrated adverse trends such as decreasing survival in localized and regional stages (urinary bladder and ovarian) and growing impact of late-stage diagnoses (esophageal cancer).  Conclusion:   While decelerating or decreasing prevalence of many cancers were due to a beneficial combination of decreasing incidence and increasing survival, there are cancers for which decelerating prevalence is due to lack of improvement in their stage-specific survival and/or increasing frequency of diagnosis at advanced stages.

After adjustment for these factors, the presence of a MDT was independently associated with the administration of chemohormonal therapy (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.68-4.59). The 2-year OS was 82.1% (95% CI: 78.5-85.6%) for patients receiving chemohormonal therapy and 59.9% (95% CI: 55.4-64.4%) for patients receiving ADT monotherapy.  Conclusion:   Being discussed in a MDT is independently associated with the administration of chemohormonal therapy in this group of patients with mPC. This supports the hypothesis that implementation of innovative treatment options is facilitated by an organizational structure with MDTs.""","""['S G Creemers', 'B Van Santvoort', 'F W P J van den Berkmortel', 'L A Kiemeney', 'I M van Oort', 'K K H Aben', 'P Hamberg;ProZIB']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate Cancer Prostatic Dis""","""['Chemohormonal Therapy in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Long-Term Survival Analysis of the Randomized Phase III E3805 CHAARTED Trial.', 'Efficacy and Safety of Combined Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and Docetaxel Compared with ADT Alone for Metastatic Hormone-Naive Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Quality of Life During Treatment With Chemohormonal Therapy: Analysis of E3805 Chemohormonal Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial in Prostate Cancer.', 'Addition of Docetaxel to Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Patients with Hormone-sensitive Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Chemohormonal Therapy in Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Addressing Challenges and Controversies in the Management of Prostate Cancer with Multidisciplinary Teams.']"""

The underlying mechanism is incompletely understood but is thought to be related to an altered microenvironment promoting tumorigenesis. However, there is a gap in the literature regarding how the effect of BCG varies according to prior radiotherapy in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). In this context, we sought to evaluate oncologic outcomes in NMIBC patients who have previously undergone prostate radiotherapy compared to patients with no prior history of pelvic radiotherapy.  Methods:   This is a retrospective cohort study that includes all patients who received intravesical for NMIBC at our institution from 2001 to 2019. Patients were stratified into 3 cohorts: prior radiotherapy (RT), radical prostatectomy (RP), and no prostate cancer (No PCa). The outcomes of interest were recurrence at 1-year, progression to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), and progression to metastatic disease. Comparisons were also made between cohorts with respect to elapsed time from radiation therapy. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used for comparing continuous variables, while Ï2 and Fischer's exact tests were used to examine categorical variables.  Results:   In 199 total patients who underwent BCG for NMIBC, 23 had a prior history of prostate radiotherapy treatment, while 17 underwent prior radical prostatectomy. Overall, 41.2% of patients had recurrence at 1 year. There was no difference in the number of induction or maintenance BCG administrations received between the cohorts within the first year. There was no significant difference in recurrence at 1 year between the 3 cohorts (P = .56). There was also no difference in progression to MIBC or progression to metastatic disease with P = .50 and 0.89, respectively.  Conclusion:   The risk of recurrence after induction BCG treatment for high-grade NMIBC does not vary according to prior radiation treatment for prostate cancer.""","""['Adri M Durant', 'Yu-Hui Chang', 'Kassem S Faraj', 'Mark D Tyson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['Impact of upper tract urothelial carcinoma on response to BCG in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin immunotherapy after previous prostate radiotherapy for high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Outcomes of subsequent non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin after radical nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.', 'The efficacy and safety outcomes of lower dose BCG compared to intravesical chemotherapy in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer: A network meta-analysis.', 'Intravesical gemcitabine therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC): a systematic review.']"""

We believe that there is a value in publishing summaries of national clinical guidelines in English for others to read and comment on.  Methods:   This is part 2 of a summary of the Swedish prostate cancer guidelines that were published in June 2022. This part covers recurrence after local treatment and management of metastatic and castration resistant disease. Part 1 covers early detection, diagnostics, staging, patient support and management of non-metastatic disease.  Results:   The 2022 Swedish guidelines include several new recommendations. Among these is a recommendation of a period of observation with repeated PSA tests for patients with approximately 10 years' life expectancy who experience a BCR more than 2-5 years after radical prostatectomy, to allow for estimating the PSA doubling time before deciding whether to give salvage radiotherapy or not. Recent results from the PEACE-1 trial led to the recommendation of triple-treatment with a GnRH agonist, abiraterone plus prednisolone and 6 cycles of docetaxel for patients with high-volume metastatic disease who are fit for chemotherapy. The Swedish guidelines differ from the European ones by having more restrictive recommendations about genetic testing of and high-dose zoledronic acid or denosumab treatment for men with metastatic prostate cancer, and by recommending considering bicalutamide monotherapy for selected patients with low-volume metastatic disease.

Yet, the risk of death from primary cancer vs. SPM is still not well understood. In this study, we investigated the survival of patients with colorectal cancer (as SPM) who had cancer in the past (prior cancer) and the risk factors of SPM death in this population.  Materials and methods:   Based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, we identified 1866 colon cancer patients with prior cancer in our main cohort and 43,959 colon cancer patients, including 37,440 patients with colon cancer as only malignancy and 6519 patients with colon cancer as subsequent colon cancer (SCC), in a second cohort and 3429 colon cancer patients, including 2371 patients with prior colon cancer (PCC) and 1058 patients with colon cancer as SPM, in a third cohort. After propensity score matching, 6519 pairs of subjects were identified in second cohort.  Results:   Patients with prior prostate and breast cancer had a higher risk of developing colon cancer compared to those with gastrointestinal cancer. Also, colon cancer patients with different prior cancer had different survival rates. Furthermore, except for prior lung cancer (52.78 vs. 25.93%), most subjects died due to colon cancer complications. The ratio of colon cancer deaths to prior cancer deaths in patients with a low stage and high stage was 1.51 and 6.64, respectively. In addition, colon cancer-specific survival (CSS) and OS rates were significantly lower in subjects with colon cancer as the SPM than in those with PCC. Also, compared with PCC, SPM was associated with OS and CSS with HR 1.59 (95 CI 1.43-1.78) and HR 2.00 (95% CI 1.70-2.36). Furthermore, compared with only colon cancer, SCC was associated with OS and CSS with HR 1.23 (95 CI 1.17-1.29) and HR 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.21).  Conclusions:   Prior cancer was found to have an adverse impact on OS in patients with colon cancer (secondary cancer), most of whom died due to colon cancer as secondary cancer itself rather than prior cancer.

The frequencies and the main effect of rs33937873 and rs6203 in HSD3B1 were compared and investigated between the patients and control using genotyping technique and statistical analysis. The mutant GA genotype of G313A in rs33937873 SNP was considered as an independent risk for PC in the multivariate regression analysis [odds ratio (OR)=2.7, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.2â5.5, P=0.01] together with positive history of hypertension (HTN) (OR=6.2, 95% CI: 3.2â12.1, P=0.0001) and begin prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; OR=8.9, 95% CI: 4.5â17.5, P=0.0001). Conversely, in rs6203 (C338T), C allele is considered as major risk allele in the development of PC (OR=1.8, 95% CI: 1.3â2.4, P=0.0003). The univariate logistic regression analyses indicated that CC genotype of rs6203 was a PC risk factor (OR=1.9, 95% CI: 1.3â2.9, P=0.002). In addition, the frequency of the AâC haplotype established by rs33937873ârs6203 was also significantly higher for PC (P=0.013). The predication of PC recurrence was associated only with positive family history (OR=7.7, 95% CI: 2.3â25.9, P=0.001) and not for The G313A and C338T SNPs. These results suggested that the two HSD3B1 polymorphisms rs33937873 and rs6203 may modify the risk of PC, particularly among patients with HTN and history of BPH, suggesting them as prominent future markers for prediction of PC risk.""","""['Yasmine M Amrousy', 'Hesham Haffez', 'Doaa M Abdou', 'Hanaa B Atya']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['Estrogen synthesis genes CYP19A1, HSD3B1, and HSD3B2 in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.', 'Association of HSD3B1 Genotype With Response to Androgen-Deprivation Therapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'HSD3B1 and resistance to androgen-deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: a retrospective, multicohort study.', 'Germline HSD3B1 Genetics and Prostate Cancer Outcomes.', 'HSD3B1 status as a biomarker of androgen deprivation resistance and implications for prostate cancer.']"""

In 2019, the research group included a total of 60 leukemia patients, all of whom were diagnosed with prostate-specific antigen (PSA). According to the range of PSA values, they were group A (18 cases), group A 0-44 mg/ml (18 cases), and group B 4-1010 mg/ml (26 cases). 10 mg/ml was divided into C group (16 cases). Another 60 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia treated at the same time served as a control group. All patients underwent sensitive MRI scanning, followed by diagnostic and clinical evaluation of weighted MRI scanning to diagnose various types of prostate cancer. The results showed that there was no difference in Ve levels among the three groups (P > 0.05); the SUSE score and Ktrans and Kep levels of the patients in group C were higher in groups B, A, and A (P < 0.05). In patients with early leukemia, SUSE score was significantly correlated with Ktrans and Kep levels (P < 0.05), but not with Ve and P > 0.05 levels.

They have been actively applied in cancer biology to investigate associations between variations and cancer phenotypes, such as susceptibility to certain types of cancer and predisposed responsiveness to specific treatments. Since GWAS primarily focuses on finding associations between individual genomic variations and cancer phenotypes, there are limitations in understanding the mechanisms by which cancer phenotypes are cooperatively affected by more than one genomic variation.  Results:   This paper proposes a network representation learning approach to learn associations among genomic variations using a prostate cancer cohort. The learned associations are encoded into representations that can be used to identify functional modules of genomic variations within genes associated with early- and late-onset prostate cancer. The proposed method was applied to a prostate cancer cohort provided by the Veterans Administration's Million Veteran Program to identify candidates for functional modules associated with early-onset prostate cancer. The cohort included 33,159 prostate cancer patients, 3181 early-onset patients, and 29,978 late-onset patients. The reproducibility of the proposed approach clearly showed that the proposed approach can improve the model performance in terms of robustness.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use a network representation learning approach to learn associations among genomic variations within genes. Associations learned in this way can lead to an understanding of the underlying mechanisms of how genomic variations cooperatively affect each cancer phenotype. This method can reveal unknown knowledge in the field of cancer biology and can be utilized to design more advanced cancer-targeted therapies.""","""['Minsu Kim', 'Jennifer E Huffman', 'Amy Justice', 'Ian Goethert', 'Greeshma Agasthya;VA Million Veteran Program;Ioana Danciu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med Genomics""","""['Functional genomics complements quantitative genetics in identifying disease-gene associations.', 'A Comprehensive Investigation of Genomic Variants in Prostate Cancer Reveals 30 Putative Regulatory Variants.', 'Tissue-specific network-based genome wide study of amygdala imaging phenotypes to identify functional interaction modules.', 'Radiomic and Genomic Machine Learning Method Performance for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Systematic Literature Review.', 'Post-GWAS in prostate cancer: from genetic association to biological contribution.']"""

High-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE) can destroy cancer cells while selectively preserving surrounding nerves and blood vessels, but no clinical trials have been conducted, to our knowledge.  Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of H-FIRE in the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a single-group, objective performance criteria, nonrandomized controlled trial. Recruitment began on May 2, 2018, and ended March 27, 2019. The follow-up duration was 6 months. This was a multicenter trial conducted at 4 tertiary teaching hospitals in China. Patients with low or intermediate risk of biochemical recurrence of localized and locally advanced PCa were eligible. Key inclusion criteria were serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level less than 20 ng/mL, clinical stage of T2c or less, and Gleason score of 7 or less. Data were analyzed from January 20 to February 20, 2021.  Intervention:   H-FIRE ablation of all lesions identified with biopsy.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was 6-month clinically significant PCa (csPCa), which was defined as any biopsy core with Gleason score of greater than or equal to 7, or Gleason score of 6 plus maximum cancer core length of greater than 3 mm or an increase from the original cancer burden. Secondary outcomes were calculated in patients who actually received H-FIRE treatment.  Results:   A total of 117 patients (median [IQR] age, 67 [62-73] years) were recruited from 4 centers, and 109 patients (27 [24.8%] low risk and 82 [75.2%] intermediate risk) actually received H-FIRE. Median (IQR) PSA level was 9.0 (6.0-12.7) ng/mL. Among the 100 patients who underwent biopsy at 6 months, the 6-month csPCa rate was 6.0% (95% CI, 2.2%-12.6%; P < .001; 1 in the treatment zone and 5 outside the treatment zone). Superiority criteria vs the historical control of 20% was achieved. PCa was detected in 14 patients, with a Gleason score of 7 in 2 patients and 6 in the remaining 12 patients. At 6 months, median (IQR) PSA level was 1.08 (0.4-3.2) ng/mL, median (IQR) International Prostate Symptom Score was 4.5 (2.0-9.5), and median (IQR) International Index of Erectile Function 5 score was 2.0 (0.5-12.5). Superiority vs the 20% historical control was also met in the subgroup analysis that only included the 57 patients with Gleason score of 7 at baseline (3.5% 6-month csPCa; 95% CI, 0.4%-12.1%).

Due to a recurrent problem with anticancer drug resistance, there is a current need for anticancer drugs with distinct modes of action for combination drug therapy We have tested two novel piperidone compounds, named 2608 (1-dichloroacetyl - 3,5-bis(3,4-difluorobenzylidene)-4-piperidone) and 2610 (1-dichloroacetyl-3,5-bis(3,4-dichlorobenzylidene)-4-piperidone), for their potential cytotoxicity on numerous human cancer cell lines. We found that both compounds were cytotoxic for breast, pancreatic, leukemia, lymphoma, colon, and fibroblast cell lines, with a cytotoxic concentration 50% (CC50) in the low micromolar to nanomolar concentration range. Further assays focused primarily on an acute lymphoblastic lymphoma and colon cancer cell lines since they were the most sensitive and resistant to the experimental piperidones. The cell death mechanism was evaluated through assays commonly used to detect the induction of apoptosis. These assays revealed that both 2608 and 2610 induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, mitochondrial depolarization, and activated caspase-3/7. Our findings suggest that the piperidones induced cell death via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Additional assays revealed that both piperidones cause cell cycle alteration in lymphoma and colon cell lines. Both piperidones elicited DNA fragmentation, as evidenced by an increment in the sub-G0/G1 subpopulation in both cell lines. Similar to other related compounds, both piperidones were found to act as proteasome inhibitors by increasing the levels of poly-ubiquitinated proteins in both lymphoma and colon cell lines. Hence, the two piperidones exhibited attractive cytotoxic properties and suitable mechanisms of action, which makes them good candidates as anticancer drugs.""","""['Risa Mia Swain', 'Lisett Contreras', 'Armando Varela-Ramirez', 'Mohammad Hossain', 'Umashankar Das', 'Carlos A Valenzuela', 'Manuel L Penichet', 'Jonathan R Dimmock', 'Renato J Aguilera']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Invest New Drugs""","""['Induction of apoptosis via proteasome inhibition in leukemia/lymphoma cells by two potent piperidones.', 'Three novel piperidones exhibit tumor-selective cytotoxicity on leukemia cells via protein degradation and stress-mediated mechanisms.', 'A novel class of piperidones exhibit potent, selective and pro-apoptotic anti-leukemia properties.', 'Novel Unsymmetric 3,5-Bis(benzylidene)-4-piperidones That Display Tumor-Selective Toxicity.', 'Discovery and Investigation of 1-4-(2-Aminoethoxy)Phenylcarbonyl- 3,5-Bis-(Benzylidene)-4-Piperidones as Candidate Antineoplastic Agents: Our Last 15 Years Study.']"""

However, some GESs originally developed to represent specific disease processes, primarily with an epithelial cell focus, are being applied to heterogeneous tumor samples where the expression of the genes in the signature may no longer be epithelial-specific. Therefore, unknowingly, even small changes in tumor stroma percentage can directly influence GESs, undermining the intended mechanistic signaling.  Experimental design:   Using colorectal cancer as an exemplar, we deployed numerous orthogonal profiling methodologies, including laser capture microdissection, flow cytometry, bulk and multiregional biopsy clinical samples, single-cell RNA sequencing and finally spatial transcriptomics, to perform a comprehensive assessment of the potential for the most widely used GESs to be influenced, or confounded, by stromal content in tumor tissue. To complement this work, we generated a freely-available resource, ConfoundR; https://confoundr.qub.ac.uk/, that enables users to test the extent of stromal influence on an unlimited number of the genes/signatures simultaneously across colorectal, breast, pancreatic, ovarian and prostate cancer datasets.  Results:   Findings presented here demonstrate the clear potential for misinterpretation of the meaning of GESs, due to widespread stromal influences, which in-turn can undermine faithful alignment between clinical samples and preclinical data/models, particularly cell lines and organoids, or tumor models not fully recapitulating the stromal and immune microenvironment.  Conclusions:   Efforts to faithfully align preclinical models of disease using phenotypically-designed GESs must ensure that the signatures themselves remain representative of the same biology when applied to clinical samples.""","""['Natalie C Fisher#', 'Ryan M Byrne#', 'Holly Leslie', 'Colin Wood', 'Assya Legrini', 'Andrew J Cameron', 'Baharak Ahmaderaghi', 'Shania M Corry', 'Sudhir B Malla', 'Raheleh Amirkhah', 'Aoife J McCooey', 'Emily Rogan', 'Keara L Redmond', 'Svetlana Sakhnevych', 'Enric Domingo', 'James Jackson', 'Maurice B Loughrey', 'Simon Leedham', 'Tim Maughan', 'Mark Lawler', 'Owen J Sansom', 'Felicity Lamrock', 'Viktor H Koelzer', 'Nigel B Jamieson#', 'Philip D Dunne#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['The Impact of Stroma Admixture on Molecular Subtypes and Prognostic Gene Signatures in Serous Ovarian Cancer.', 'High-grade serous tubo-ovarian cancer refined with single-cell RNA sequencing: specific cell subtypes influence survival and determine molecular subtype classification.', 'Development of a predictive model for stromal content in prostate cancer samples to improve signature performance.', 'Gene expression analysis of in vitro cocultures to study interactions between breast epithelium and stroma.', '""Stemness"" genomics law governs clinical behavior of human cancer: implications for decision making in disease management.', 'MAPK inhibitor sensitivity scores predict sensitivity driven by the immune infiltration in pediatric low-grade gliomas.', 'Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Deconvolutes Prognostic Histological Subgroups in Patients with Colorectal Cancer and Synchronous Liver Metastases.', 'Histopathological Growth Pattern in Colorectal Liver Metastasis and The Tumor Immune Microenvironment.']"""

Methods:   Ki67 mRNA levels were determined utilizing data from a TCGA cohort (Tumor(n)=492 and control(n)=52). The protein expression was determined on 94 biopsies from patients by immunohistochemical assay.  Results:   in mRNA, the Ki67 upregulation is associated with cancer tissue (p<0.0001) and worst disease-free survival (p=0.035). The protein upregulation is associated with increase of the ISUP score (p<0.0001), cancer stage (p=0.05), biochemical recurrence (p=0.0006) and metastasis (p<0.0001).

Varicocele repair (VR) is frequently performed to improve semen parameters and the chances of pregnancy. However, there is a lack of consensus about the diagnosis, indications for VR and its outcomes. The aim of this study was to explore global practice patterns on the management of varicocele in the context of male infertility.  Materials and methods:   Sixty practicing urologists/andrologists from 23 countries contributed 382 multiple-choice-questions pertaining to varicocele management. These were condensed into an online questionnaire that was forwarded to clinicians involved in male infertility management through direct invitation. The results were analyzed for disagreement and agreement in practice patterns and, compared with the latest guidelines of international professional societies (American Urological Association [AUA], American Society for Reproductive Medicine [ASRM], and European Association of Urology [EAU]), and with evidence emerging from recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Additionally, an expert opinion on each topic was provided based on the consensus of 16 experts in the field.  Results:   The questionnaire was answered by 574 clinicians from 59 countries. The majority of respondents were urologists/uro-andrologists. A wide diversity of opinion was seen in every aspect of varicocele diagnosis, indications for repair, choice of technique, management of sub-clinical varicocele and the role of VR in azoospermia. A significant proportion of the responses were at odds with the recommendations of AUA, ASRM, and EAU. A large number of clinical situations were identified where no guidelines are available.  Conclusions:   This study is the largest global survey performed to date on the clinical management of varicocele for male infertility. It demonstrates: 1) a wide disagreement in the approach to varicocele management, 2) large gaps in the clinical practice guidelines from professional societies, and 3) the need for further studies on several aspects of varicocele management in infertile men.""","""['Rupin Shah', 'Ashok Agarwal', 'Parviz Kavoussi', 'Amarnath Rambhatla', 'Ramadan Saleh', 'Rossella Cannarella', 'Ahmed M Harraz',

Although several life-prolonging systemic agents are available, there is no robust multivariable model to predict prognosis and improve risk stratification in mCSPC. The objective of this study was to build and validate a multivariable prognostic model to predict overall survival (OS) in mCSPC.  Methods:   We used data from LATITUDE, a phase III randomized controlled trial in which men with de novo mCSPC were randomly allocated to either ADT plus abiraterone or ADT with placebo. Patients with non-missing data (n = 1,058) were randomly split in a 70:30 ratio to training (n = 743) and testing (n = 315) sets. Elastic net regression was used for variable selection. A multivariable Cox regression model for OS was then fitted using the selected variables. The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed on the testing set using the time-dependent area under curve (tAUC) with bootstrapped confidence intervals [CI] primarily for OS and secondarily for radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS).  Results:   The 11 prognostic variables in the final model were performance status, number of skeletal metastases, Gleason score, presence of liver metastasis, worst pain score, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, and treatment regimen. The tAUC for predicting OS at 2- and 3-years was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.67-0.80) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65-0.77), respectively. The tAUC for rPFS at 2- and 3-years was 0.72 (95% CI, 0.65-0.77) and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70-0.82), respectively.  Conclusions:   A prognostic model for men with de novo mCSPC was developed and validated in an independent testing set. Our model had high accuracy for predicting OS and rPFS.

However, receipt of preventive care and management of pre-existent CVD has not been well studied in prostate cancer survivors.  Methods:   This study examined a prospective cohort of men newly diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2011 and 2013 throughout North Carolina linked to Medicare and private insurance claims and clinical data from the Veterans Affairs (VA). In patients without pre-existent CVD, the primary outcome was a composite measure of annual preventive care (blood glucose screening, cholesterol level testing, and â¥ 1 primary care provider visit). In patients with pre-existent CVD, the primary outcome was annual cardiologist visit; blood glucose, cholesterol level testing, and primary care visits were also assessed.  Results:   Our sample comprised 492 patients successfully linked to insurance claims and/or VA data, among whom 103 (20.9%) had pre-existent CVD. Receipt of preventive care declined from 52.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 47.7 to 57.6%) during the first year after prostate cancer diagnosis to 40.8% (95% CI: 33.7 to 48.4%) during the third year. Among patients with pre-existent CVD, only 23.4% (95% CI: 13.6 to 37.2%) visited a cardiologist in all 3 years. Black men were more likely than White men to visit a cardiologist the first year (risk ratio [RR] = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.71).  Conclusion:   In a population-based cohort of prostate cancer survivors, receipt of CVD preventive care declined over time, and frequency of cardiologist-led management of pre-existent CVD was low.

Methods:   Prospective study enrolling patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) undergoing RARP with mp-MRI-based 3D model reconstruction, displayed in a cognitive or augmented-reality fashion, at our Centre from 01/2016 to 01/2020. A control no-3D group was extracted from the last two years of our Institutional RARP database. PSMr between the two groups was evaluated and multivariable linear regression (MLR) models were applied. Finally, Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to calculate biochemical recurrence at 12 months after the intervention.  Results:   160 patients were enrolled in the 3D Group, while 640 were selected for the Control Group. A more conservative NS approach was registered in the 3D Group (full NS 20.6% vs 12.7%; intermediate NS 38.1% vs 38.0%; standard NS 41.2% vs 49.2%; p = 0.02). 3D Group patients had lower PSM rates (25 vs. 35.1%, p = 0.01). At MLR models, the availability of 3D technology (p = 0.005) and the absence of extracapsular extension (ECE, p = 0.004) at mp-MRI were independent predictors of lower PSMr. Moreover, 3D model represented a significant protective factor for PSM in patients with ECE or pT3 disease.

Methods: For this feasibility study, 2 patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer underwent transperineal needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy during ultrasound-guided transperineal template mapping biopsies. After intravenous administration of fluorescein, needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging was performed with a forward-looking probe (outer diameter 0.9 mm) in 2 trajectories during a manual push-forward and pullback motion. A biopsy was taken in a coregistered parallel adjacent trajectory to the confocal laser endomicroscopy trajectory for histopathologic comparison. Peri- and postprocedural adverse events, confocal laser endomicroscopy device malfunction and procedural failures were recorded. Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy image quality assessment, image interpretation, and histology were performed by an experienced confocal laser endomicroscopy rater and uro-pathologist, blinded to any additional information. Results: In both patients, no peri- and post-procedural adverse events were reported following needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy. No confocal laser endomicroscopy device malfunction nor procedural failures were reported. Within 1.5 min after intravenous administration of fluorescein, needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy image quality was sufficient for interpretation for at least 14 min, yielding more than 5000 confocal laser endomicroscopy frames per patient. The pullback confocal laser endomicroscopy recordings and most of the push-forward recordings almost only visualized erythrocytes, being classified as non-representative. During the push-forward recordings, prostate tissue was occasionally visualized in single frames, insufficient for histopathologic comparison. Prostate carcinoma was identified by biopsy in one patient (Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7, >50%), while the biopsy from the other patient showed no malignancy. Conclusion: Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy imaging of in-vivo prostate tissue with a forward-looking confocal laser endomicroscopy probe is safe without device malfunctions or procedural failures. Needle-based confocal laser endomicroscopy is technically feasible, but the acquired confocal laser endomicroscopy datasets are non-representative. The confocal laser endomicroscopy images' non-representative nature is possibly caused by bleeding artifacts, movement artifacts and a lack of contact time with the tissue of interest. A different confocal laser endomicroscopy probe or procedure might yield representative images of prostatic tissue.""","""['Luigi A M J G van Riel', 'Abel Swaan', 'Christophe K Mannaerts', 'Rob A A van Kollenburg', 'C Dilara Savci Heijink', 'Theo M de Reijke', 'Daniel M de Bruin', 'Jan Erik Freund']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Needle-Based, In Vivo Feasibility Study Protocol (IDEAL Phase 2A).', 'Intraoperative Optical Biopsy during Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using Confocal Endomicroscopy.', 'Atlas of Ex Vivo Prostate Tissue and Cancer Images Using Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy: A Project for Intraoperative Positive Surgical Margin Detection During Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Probe based confocal laser endomicroscopy of the pancreatobiliary system.', 'SAGES TAVAC safety and efficacy analysis confocal laser endomicroscopy.']"""

However, there are few reports on the toxicity of external beam irradiation (RT) for prostate cancer in patients after prior HoLEP. In this study, we evaluate the side effects and treatment outcomes of RT after HoLEP.  Materials/methods:   Eighteen patients who had HoLEP and subsequently received RT for prostate cancer were included. Data collected included patient and disease characteristics, urinary function, and radiation dose. Acute and late urinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) side effects were evaluated. Disease control and survival rates were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Median follow-up was 18 months (range: 4-46 months). Median prostate volume was 107 ml before HoLEP and 24 ml after HoLEP. Median International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was 17 (range: 5-32) before HoLEP. Median decline in IPSS score after HoLEP was 7 (range: -2-21). On uroflow study, peak flow rate, and post-void residual were significantly improved after HoLEP. After radiation, peak flow rate and average flow rate showed a decline but remained significantly improved compared to pre-HoLEP measurements. Maximum acute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) adverse events were 12 grade 1 and 3 grade 2 for GU, and 3 grade 1 for GI, respectively. Maximum late adverse events were 13 grade 1 and 2 grade 2 for GU, and all grade 0 for GI, respectively. At last follow-up, there were 8 grade 1 and 1 grade 2 late GU, and 3 grade 1 late GI adverse events, respectively. There was no significant increase in urinary incontinence after RT compared to before RT. The 18-month biochemical control, local control, distant control rates were 78%, 94%, and 80%, respectively.

There are many obstacles to overcome due to the large size of the gene and the small number of samples in the microarray. A combination strategy for gene expression in a variety of diseases is described in this paper, consisting of two steps: identifying the most effective genes via soft ensembling and classifying them with a novel deep neural network. The feature selection approach combines three strategies to select wrapper genes and rank them according to the k-nearest neighbour algorithm, resulting in a very generalisable model with low error levels. Using soft ensembling, the most effective subsets of genes were identified from three microarray datasets of diffuse large cell lymphoma, leukaemia, and prostate cancer. A stacked deep neural network was used to classify all three datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 97.51%, 99.6%, and 96.34%, respectively. In addition, two previously unreported datasets from small, round blue cell tumors (SRBCTs)and multiple sclerosis-related brain tissue lesions were examined to show the generalisability of the model method.""","""['Khosro Rezaee', 'Gwanggil Jeon', 'Mohammad R Khosravi', 'Hani H Attar', 'Alireza Sabzevari']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""IET Syst Biol""","""['Hybrid genetic algorithm-neural network: feature extraction for unpreprocessed microarray data.', 'Deep-Learning-Based Cancer Profiles Classification Using Gene Expression Data Profile.', 'Comparison of feature selection and classification combinations for cancer classification using microarray data.', 'Filter versus wrapper gene selection approaches in DNA microarray domains.', 'Microarrays--identifying molecular portraits for prostate tumors with different Gleason patterns.', '5G System Overview for Ongoing Smart Applications: Structure, Requirements, and Specifications.', 'Control System Development and Implementation of a CNC Laser Engraver for Environmental Use with Remote Imaging.']"""

We developed a nomogram predicting the overall survival (OS) of mCRPC patients receiving standard chemotherapy using data from five randomized clinical trials (RCTs).  Methods:   Patients enrolled in the control arm of five RCTs (ASCENT 2, VENICE, CELGENE/MAINSAIL, ENTHUSE 14, and ENTHUSE 33) were randomly split between training (n = 1636, 70%) and validation cohorts (n = 700, 30%). In the training cohort, Cox regression tested the prognostic significance of all available variables as a predictor of OS. Independent predictors of OS on multivariable analysis were used to construct a novel multivariable model (nomogram). The accuracy of this model was tested in the validation cohort using time-dependent area under the curve (tAUC) and calibration curves.  Results:   Most of the patients were aged 65-74 years (44.5%) and the median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 13.9 (8.9-20.2) months. At multivariable analysis, the following were independent predictors of OS in mCRPC patients: sites of metastasis (visceral vs. bone metastasis, hazard ratio [HR]: 1.24), prostate-specific antigen (HR: 1.00), aspartate transaminase (HR: 1.01), alkaline phosphatase (HR: 1.00), body mass index (HR: 0.97), and hemoglobin (â¥13 g/dl vs. <11 g/dl, HR: 0.41; all p < 0.05). A nomogram based on these variables was developed and showed favorable discrimination (tAUC at 12 and 24 months: 73% and 72%, respectively) and calibration characteristics on external validation.  Conclusion:   A new prognostic model to predict OS of patients with mCRPC undergoing first line chemotherapy was developed. This can help urologists/oncologists in counseling patients and might be useful to better stratify patients for future clinical trials.""","""['Daniele Modonutti', 'Sami E Majdalany', 'Nicholas Corsi', 'Pin Li', 'Akshay Sood', 'Deepansh Dalela', 'Marcus L Jamil', 'Clara Hwang', 'Mani Menon', 'Craig G Rogers', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh', 'Giacomo Novara', 'Firas Abdollah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Prediction of overall survival for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: development of a prognostic model through a crowdsourced challenge with open clinical trial data.', 'Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a prognostic biomarker for men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy: data from two randomized phase III trials.', 'Prognostic model predicting metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer survival in men treated with second-line chemotherapy.', 'Updated prognostic model for predicting overall survival in first-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Revealing the prognostic landscape of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide: a meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   Fifty-five patients were enrolled. H-IMPT consisted of 45 GyE to the pelvic lymph nodes and 67.5 GyE to the prostate and seminal vesicles in 25 fractions. PRQOL was assessed with the urinary incontinence (UI), urinary irritative/obstructive symptoms (UO), and bowel function (BF) domains of EPIC-26 questionnaire. Mean changes in domain scores were analyzed from pretreatment to the end of treatment and 3 months posttreatment. A clinically meaningful change (or minimum important change) was defined as a score change > 50% of the baseline standard deviation.  Results:   The mean scores of UO, UI, and BF at baseline were 84.6, 91.1, and 95.3, respectively. At the end of treatment, there were statistically significant and clinically meaningful declines in UO and BF scores (-13.5 and -2.3, respectively), while the decline in UI score was statistically significant but not clinically meaningful (-13.7). A clinically meaningful decline in UO, UI, and BF scores occurred in 53.5%, 22.7%, and 73.2% of the patients, respectively. At 3 months posttreatment, all three mean scores showed an improvement, with fewer patients having a clinically meaningful decline in UO, UI, and BF scores (18.4%, 20.5%, and 45.0%, respectively). There was no significant reduction in the mean UO and UI scores compared to baseline, although the mean BF score remained lower than baseline and the difference was clinically meaningful.  Conclusions:   UO, UI, and BF scores of PRQOL declined at the end of H-IMPT. UO and UI scores showed improvement at 3 months posttreatment and were similar to the baseline scores.

Methods:   Healthy male volunteers between 50 and 70 years old were recruited during a 30-day public screening program. PSA levels were measured using two different methods (standard enhanced chemiluminescence immunoassay-ECLIA, and novel immunochromatography assay-ICA/rapid PSA) in the same blood sample. Two blood samples were drawn; first before DRE and the second 30-40 min after DRE. The effect of DRE on PSA levels and its impact on clinical decision-making for individual patients were evaluated based on different biopsy trigger cutoffs.  Results:   ECLIA-PSA was measured in 74 participants both pre- and 37 Â± 5 min post-DRE, mean age 57.2 Â± 8.3 years, and mean prostate volume 33.6 (20-80) cm3. Both total and free ECLIA-PSA increased significantly after DRE (mean increase of 0.47 and 0.26 ng/ml, respectively, both p < 0.001). Different internationally accepted biopsy triggers were reached after DRE only: 5 total PSA > 3 ng/ml, 13 increase > 0.75 ng/ml, 3 PSA density > 0.15, and 1 free/total PSA < 0.18. On two occasions, patients were pushed away from biopsy trigger after DRE due to free/total PSA > 0.18.

Previously, among men undergoing prostate biopsy, we found higher serum SHLP2 was linked with lower prostate cancer (PC) risk in European American men (EAM), while null associations were found in African American men (AAM). Here, in different patients undergoing prostate biopsy, we tested the link between SHLP2, humanin and MOTS-c and PC risk by race.  Methods:   Plasma SHLP2, humanin, and MOTS-c were measured in 198 men (50/49 EAM/AAM cases; 50/49 EAM/AAM controls) undergoing biopsy. Logistic and multinomial regression models tested associations between each MDP and PC diagnosis, low-grade (grade group, GG1) and high-grade (GG2-5). Models were adjusted for age, body mass index, digital rectal examination, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). We tested interactions between MDPs and race.  Results:   Among controls, humanin was similar by race (p = 0.60), but both SHLP2 (p = 0.007) and MOTS-c (p = 0.026) were lower in AAM controls versus EAM controls. Among EAM, higher MDP values were associated with lower PC risk (all p â¤ 0.001), with null associations in AAM (all p-interactions â¤ 0.01). Similarly, higher MDP expression was associated with decreased risk of low- and high-grade PC in EAM (all p â¤ 0.005) with null associations in AAM.  Conclusions:   Higher MDP levels were associated with lower PC risk in EAM but not AAM. Generally, AAM controls had lower MDP levels. These data support MDPs and mitochondrial dysfunction in PC, suggesting greater dysfunction in AAM may contribute to excess PC risk. Future larger studies are needed to confirm these results.""","""['Adela Ramirez-Torres', 'Allison L Reagan', 'Lauren E Howard', 'Emily Wiggins', 'Adriana C Vidal', 'Junxiang Wan', 'Brendan Miller', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Pinchas Cohen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['MDPs and racial differences in prostate cancer.', 'Mitochondrial-derived peptides in energy metabolism.', 'Plasma mitochondrial derived peptides MOTS-c and SHLP2 positively associate with android and liver fat in people without diabetes.', 'Commercial Gene Expression Tests for Prostate Cancer Prognosis Provide Paradoxical Estimates of Race-Specific Risk.', 'Low circulating levels of the mitochondrial-peptide hormone SHLP2: novel biomarker for prostate cancer risk.', 'Mitochondrial-Derived Peptides Exacerbate Senescence.', 'Mitochondrial Alterations in Prostate Cancer: Roles in Pathobiology and Racial Disparities.', 'MDPs and racial differences in prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To quantify veterans' overall use and cost of low-value services, including VA-delivered care and VA-purchased community care.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study assessed a national population of VA-enrolled veterans. Data on enrollment, sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, and health care services delivered by VA facilities or paid for by the VA through VACC programs were compiled for fiscal year 2018 from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Data analysis was conducted from April 2020 to January 2022.  Main outcomes and measures:   VA administrative data were applied using an established low-value service metric to quantify the use of 29 potentially low-value tests and procedures delivered in VA facilities and by VACC programs across 6 domains: cancer screening, diagnostic and preventive testing, preoperative testing, imaging, cardiovascular testing and procedures, and other procedures. Sensitive and specific criteria were used to determine the low-value service counts per 100 veterans overall, by domain, and by individual service; count and percentage of each low-value service delivered by each setting; and estimated cost of each service.  Results:   Among 5.2 million enrolled veterans, the mean (SD) age was 62.5 (16.0) years, 91.7% were male, 68.0% were non-Hispanic White, and 32.3% received any service through VACC. By specific criteria, 19.6 low-value services per 100 veterans were delivered in VA facilities or by VACC programs, involving 13.6% of veterans at a total cost of $205.8 million. Overall, the most frequently delivered low-value service was prostate-specific antigen testing for men aged 75 years or older (5.9 per 100 veterans); this was also the service with the greatest proportion delivered by VA facilities (98.9%). The costliest low-value services were spinal injections for low back pain ($43.9 million; 21.4% of low-value care spending) and percutaneous coronary intervention for stable coronary disease ($36.8 million; 17.9% of spending).  Conclusions and relevance:   This cross-sectional study found that among veterans enrolled in the VA, more than 1 in 10 have received a low-value service from VA facilities or VACC programs, with approximately $200 million in associated costs.

As an example, we focus on aligning intra-subject multiparametric Magnetic Resonance (mpMR) images, between T2-weighted (T2w) scans and diffusion-weighted scans with high b-value (DWI [Formula: see text]). For the application of localising tumours in mpMR images, diffusion scans with zero b-value (DWI [Formula: see text]) are considered easier to register to T2w due to the availability of corresponding features. We propose a learning from privileged modality algorithm, using a training-only imaging modality DWI [Formula: see text], to support the challenging multi-modality registration problems. We present experimental results based on 369 sets of 3D multiparametric MRI images from 356 prostate cancer patients and report, with statistical significance, a lowered median target registration error of 4.34 mm, when registering the holdout DWI [Formula: see text] and T2w image pairs, compared with that of 7.96 mm before registration. Results also show that the proposed learning-based registration networks enabled efficient registration with comparable or better accuracy, compared with a classical iterative algorithm and other tested learning-based methods with/without the additional modality.

Nonetheless, a therapeutic response may fail to appear in a proportion of patients. This study aims to identify routinely obtainable pre- and intratherapeutic parameters to allow a prediction of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.  Methods:   Between January 2015 and December 2020 52 patients treated with a total of 146 cycles Lu-177-PSMA-617-RLT were retrospectively analysed in a single-center trial. The median overall survival time (OS) was compared to pre-therapeutic serological parameters, the extend of metastatic spread and previously performed therapies using Kaplan-Meier estimators and multivariate Cox-regression. Bonferroni-Holm correction was performed on all statistical tests.  Results:   The median OS of all patients was 55.6 weeks. Multivariate Cox-regression revealed significant lower survival for decreased pretherapeutic hemoglobin levels (HR 0.698 per g/dl; 95%-CI 0.560-0.872; p = 0.001), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (HR 1.073 per 25 U/l; 95%-CI 1.024-1.125; p = 0.003) and the presence of hepatic metastasis (HR 6.981; 95%-CI 2.583-18.863; p < 0.001). Increased pretherapeutic c-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were also associated with a shorter survival. A prostate-specific antigen decline after one therapy cycle did not significantly correlate with an increased survival. No significant relations were observed between overall survival time and other serological parameters or previously performed therapies.

We aim to evaluate the prognostic impact of radiographic maximum tumor diameter (MTD) in men with localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   From a single-center retrospective cohort of men receiving definitive treatment for PCa (radical prostatectomy [RP] or radiotherapy [RT]) with available pretreatment MRI, we conducted univariable and multivariable Cox proportional-hazards models for progression using clinical variables including age, NCCN risk group, radiographic extracapsular extension (ECE), radiographic seminal vesical invasion (SVI), and MTD. RP and RT cohorts were analyzed separately. Covariates were used in a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and progression-free survival was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and groups were compared using log-rank tests.  Results:   The cohort included 631 patients (n = 428 RP, n = 203 RT). CART analysis identified 4 prognostic groups for patients treated with RP and 2 prognostic groups in those treated with RT. In the RP cohort, NCCN low/intermediate risk group patients with MTD>=15 mm had significantly worse PFS than those with MTD <= 14 mm, and NCCN high-risk patients with radiographic ECE had significantly worse PFS than those without ECE. In the RT cohort, PFS was significantly worse in the cohort with MTD >= 23 mm than those <= 22 mm.

Its histological diagnosis is based on prostate biopsy. The transrectal procedure is one of the most common procedures performed by urologists. Although it is considered safe, post-biopsy infectious complications are frequently observed in practice. The aim of this study is to investigate the value of urine culture before the transrectal biopsy. Secondly, we assessed potential risk factors for infectious complications following TR-PB.  Methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent urine culture tests before transrectal prostate biopsy between January 2019 and July 2020. The inclusion criteria for the study were all indications for prostate biopsy (PSA>4ng/mL or abnormal digital rectal examination). Baseline characteristics and the incidence of post-biopsy urinary tract infection were compared between patients showing positive pre-biopsy culture results and those showing negative findings. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine risk factors for infectious complications following TR-PB.  Results:   Out of 163 patients included in our study, 19 patients (11.65%) had positive urine culture results before the biopsy. Age (P=0.068); history of hospitalization (P>0.999), history previous of quinolone use (P=0.75), history of UTI (P=0.64); median PSA level at diagnosis (P=0.267); prostate volume (P=0.78); post-void residual volume (P=0.374); percentage of patients testing positive for cancer on biopsy (P=0.81); and percentages of patients with a history of biopsy (P=0.889), diabetes mellitus (P=0.524), hypertension (P=0.714) and immunosuppressive medication use (P>0.999) were similar between the two groups. One patient in the positive urine culture group had post-biopsy prostatitis. However, 3.24% (five patients) of the negative urine culture group had the disease (P=0.789) (four patients with prostatitis and one with epididymitis). Among them, four patients were diagnosed by urine culture at the time of post-biopsy urinary tract infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that history of hospitalization and history of previous quinolone use were risk factors for infection after transrectal prostate biopsy.  Conclusion:   Our study suggests that systematically performing urine cultures before transrectal prostate biopsy does not reduce the rate of infectious complications after biopsy.

In advanced stage, palliative treatments are used instead of curative therapies. Therefore, finding predictive indicators seems crucial. Patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that received Dx chemotherapy have been retrospectively reviewed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether docetaxel (Dx)-free interval could have a predictive value for PCa and influence other sequential therapies.  Material and methods:   This clinical trial study was performed on 104 patients at Medeniyet University Oncology Clinic in 2018-2020. All CRPC patients had metastases, received Dx as first-line treatment and underwent androgen receptor axis targeted (ARAT) therapy after disease progression. We analyzed patients' progression time after Dx therapy and the effects on sequential treatment.  Results:   After Dx therapy, all patients received ARAT (abiraterone (ABI) n: 49 (47.1%) and enzalutamide (ENZ) n: 54 (51.9%)) as a second-line treatment, except for one patient who received cabazitaxel. There was a statistically significant relationship between the Dx-free interval and duration of response to ARAT (p<0.001). The response time of ARAT treatment was <10.5 months in all patients whose Dx-free interval period was <9 months.  Conclusions:   Our findings support the theory that Dx-free interval can be a predictive factor for CRPC.

The goal of this study was to use three conceptually distinct measures of morbidity to examine the association between these measures and mortality.  Materials and methods:   Using Medicare claims data linked with the 2012-2016 Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System we identified older adults with incident primary cancer sites of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate (n = 29,140). We used claims data to identify their Elixhauser comorbidities, Multimorbidity-Weighted Index (MWI), and Claims Frailty Index (CFI) as measures of MCC, multimorbidity, and frailty, respectively. We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the association between these measures and survival time since diagnosis.  Results:   Lung cancer patients had the highest levels of MCC, multimorbidity, and frailty. There was a positive association between all three measures and a greater hazard of death after adjusting for age, sex (colorectal and lung only), and stage. Breast cancer patients with 5+ comorbidities had an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.63 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38, 1.93), and those with mild frailty had an aHR of 3.38 (95% CI; 2.12, 5.41). The C statistics for breast cancer were 0.79, 0.78, and 0.79 for the MCC, MWI, and CFI respectively. Similarly, lung cancer patients who were moderately or severely frail had an aHR of 1.82 (95% CI: 1.53, 2.18) while prostate cancer patients had an aHR of 3.39 (95% CI: 2.12, 5.41) and colorectal cancer patients had an aHR of 4.51 (95% CI: 3.23, 6.29). Model performance was nearly identical across the MCC, multimorbidity, and frailty models within cancer type. The models performed best for prostate and breast cancer, and notably worse for lung cancer. The frailty models showed the greatest separation in unadjusted survival curves.  Discussion:   The MCC, multimorbidity, and frailty indices performed similarly well in predicting mortality among a large cohort of older cancer patients. However, there were notable differences by cancer type.

Results: A total of 206 cases of microfocal adenocarcinoma were diagnosed on prostate biopsies from 2013 to 2019, accounting for 6.7% of all adenocarcinoma cases. There were 139 cases of 1 positive core and 67 cases of 2 positive cores. Patients with microfocal adenocarcinoma were younger than those with non-microfocal adenocarcinoma (69 years versus 71 years, P<0.001). Compared with patients with non-microfocal adenocarcinoma, the pre-biopsy total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) and free prostate specific antigen (fPSA) levels in patients with microfocal adenocarcinoma were both lower (11.2 Î¼g/L2 versus 23.7 Î¼g/L2; 1.4 Î¼g/L2 versus 3.0 Î¼g/L2, P<0.001), the fPSA/tPSA level was higher (12.9% versus 10.7%, P<0.05), the prostate volume was larger (38.9 mL versus 34.3 mL, P<0.05), and the PSA density was lower (0.3 Î¼g/L2 versus 0.8 Î¼g/L2, P<0.001). 130 patients underwent radical prostatectomy, 30 patients chose active monitoring, 31 patients chose endocrine or radiation therapy, and 15 patients were lost to follow-up. Three patients in the active surveillance group underwent radical prostatectomy for disease progression after 21-39 months observation. Biochemical relapses occurred in two patients in the radical prostatectomy group. The remaining patients have no disease progression or recurrence at present. Compared with radical prostatectomy specimens, Gleason score in the biopsy material was increased in 64/115 patients (55.7%). Among resection excision specimens, 14 cases (12.2%) had extraprostatic extension (EPE), 35 cases (30.4%) had perineural invasion, and 16 cases (13.9%) had a positive margin. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that low fPSA/tPSA ratio and 2 positive cores were independent risk factors for Gleason score increase in the radical prostatectomy specimens. A low fPSA/tPSA ratio was an independent risk factor for perineural invasion. Low fPSA/tPSA ratio and low prostate volume were associated with a positive margin in radical prostatectomy specimens. Conclusions: In this study, patients diagnosed with microfocal adenocarcinoma on prostate biopsy account for a high proportion of the patients with increased Gleason score in the radical prostatectomy specimens, and there is a certain proportion of adverse pathological features in the radical specimens. Therefore, for the patients with only a small amount of low-grade adenocarcinoma found in biopsy, PSA levels and PSA density should be taken into consideration in treatment selection.""","""['L Nie', 'X Q Chen', 'Y K Song', 'M N Zhang', 'M Xu', 'J Gong', 'Q Zhou', 'N Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['The percent of cores positive for cancer in prostate needle biopsy specimens is strongly predictive of tumor stage and volume at radical prostatectomy.', 'Adenocarcinoma of the prostate with Gleason score 9-10 on core biopsy: correlation with findings at radical prostatectomy and prognosis.', 'Correlation of the anatomo-pathological staging of radical prostatectomy specimens with the amount of cancer in the preoperative sextant biopsy.', 'Prostate cancer reporting: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Prostate cancer reporting and staging: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

Method: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 274 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy in Beijing Hospital from June 2018 to June 2021. The margins of these specimens of radical prostatectomy were directly inked with black ink. According to the margin status (tumor present versus not), the patients were divided into PSM and negative surgical margin (NSM) groups. The clinicopathological characteristics were compared between two groups, including age, preoperative prostate specific antigen (PSA), number of tumors, tumor's location, postoperative pathological Gleason score, tumor burden and postoperative pathological staging. Results: Among the 274 cases, 114 showed PSM, and 160 showed NSM. PSM accounted for 41.6% of the cases. The mean age was 68.3 years, while the PSM group's mean age was 68.0 years, and that of the NSM group was 68.6 years, with no statistical significance between groups (P>0.05). The mean preoperative PSA was 15.8 Î¼g/L in all patients, 21.5 Î¼g/L in the PSM group and 11.3 Î¼g/L in NSM group. PSA in the PSM group was statistically higher than that in the NSM group (P<0.001). The PSA level (10 Î¼g/L, 10-20 Î¼g/L, and >20 Î¼g/L) was associated with the PSM rate (31.1%, 48.7%, and 69.4%). Regarding tumor numbers, 118 cases had a single focus, including 40 cases with PSM (33.9%). In the 156 cases of multiple foci, 74 cases had a PSM (47.4%). There were statistically more PSM cases in the cases with multi-focal disease (P<0.05). Tumors were seen in the transit zone of 44 cases, while 107 cases showed tumors in the peripheral zone, and 123 cases in the whole zone. The PSM rate was 27.3% (12/44), 40.2% (43/107), and 48.0% (59/123) by tumor location, respectively, but the difference among groups was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The postoperative Gleason scores were 3+3=6 in 51 cases, 3+4=7 in 98 cases, 4+3=7 in 81 cases, and â¥8 in 44 cases, with PSM rates of 19.6% (10/51), 38.8% (38/98), 45.7% (37/81) and 65.9% (29/44), respectively (P<0.001 for rate differences). The tumor burden was <30% in 157 cases, 30%-60% in 91 cases, and>60% in 26 cases, with PSM rate of 21.0% (33/157), 65.9% (60/91) and 80.8% (21/26), respectively (P<0.001 for rate differences). Moreover, there were 181 cases of pathological stage T2 (PSM rate, 29.3%) and 93 cases of pathological stage T3 (PSM rate, 65.6%), with statistical difference in PSM rates (P<0.001). The multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that preoperative PSA >20 Î¼g/L, postoperative Gleason score â¥8, high tumor burden and pathological stags were different between the PSM and NSM groups (P<0.05). Conclusions: The PSM of radical prostatectomy is closely related to the preoperative PSA level, the number of lesions, postoperative Gleason score, tumor burden and pathological stage. Preoperative PSA level >20 Î¼g/L, postoperative Gleason score â¥8, high tumor burden and pathological stage are independent predictors for PSM.""","""['L T Liu', 'D Cui', 'M Wang', 'M Liu', 'D G Liu', 'W Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['Surgical strategy selection and experience summary of prostate cancer with positive single needle biopsy.', 'Microfocal prostate cancer: a clinicopathological analysis of 206 cases.', 'Impact of positive surgical margins on prostate-specific antigen failure after radical prostatectomy in adjuvant treatment-naÃ¯ve patients.', 'Positive surgical margins during robotic radical prostatectomy: a contemporary analysis of risk factors.', 'Clinicopathological Significances of Positive Surgical Resection Margin after Radical Prostatectomy for Prostatic Cancers: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

The quantitative parameters of ADC and DCE-MRI were measured. There were 4 patients (6.67%) with a Gleason score of 6 and 15 patients (25%) with a 4 + 3 score. The ADC with Gleason = 6 is 0.81 Â± 0.08 Ã 10-3 s/mm2, the ADC with Gleason = 3 + 4 is 0.74 Â± 0.07 Ã 10-3 s/mm2, the ADC with Gleason = 4 + 3 is 0.73 Â± 0.05 Ã 10-3 s/mm2, the ADC with Gleason = 9 is 0.65 Â± 0.06 Ã 10-3 s/mm2, and the ADC with Gleason = 10 is 0.59 Â± 0.07 Ã 10-3 s/mm2. As the Gleason score increased, the ADC decreased and the permeation parameter transfer constant increased. When the ADC was combined with the permeability parameter transfer constant, the AUC of Gleason = 6 points and Gleason = 7 points was greatly different (P < 0.05). The 95% CI of the ADC combined permeability parameter transport constant when Gleason = 6 points and Gleason = 7 points was 0.898-0.934, the sensitivity was 75.4%, and the specificity was 86.2%.

The comprehensive analyses for SHCBP1 in various tumors, including gene expression, diagnosis, prognosis, immune-related features, genetic alteration, and function enrichment, were conducted based on multiple databases and analysis tools. SHCBP1 was upregulated in most types of cancers. The results of qRT-PCR had confirmed that SHCBP1 mRNA was significantly upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cell lines. Based on the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and survival analysis, SHCBP1 was considered as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. Furthermore, SHCBP1 expression was linked with tumor immunity and immunosuppressive microenvironment according to the correlation analysis of SHCBP1 expression with immune cells infiltration, immune checkpoint genes, and immune-related genes (MHC genes, chemokines, and chemokines receptors). Moreover, SHCBP1 expression correlated with tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and neoantigens. The feature of SHCBP1 mutational landscape in pan-cancer was identified.

AR associates with ELK1 by coopting its two ERK docking sites, through the amino-terminal domain (A/B domain) of AR. Using a mammalian two-hybrid assay, we have now functionally mapped amino acids within the peptide segments 358-457 and 514-557 in the A/B domain as required for association with ELK1.

Comparison of the relative contributions of the interacting motifs/segments in ELK1 and AR to coactivation of ELK1 by AR suggested a parallel mode of binding of AR and ELK1 polypeptides. Growth of PCa cells was partially inhibited by deletion of the upstream segment in AR and nearly fully inhibited by deletion of the downstream segment.

There is an unmet clinical need to target androgen receptor (AR) splice variants, which are key drivers of the disease. Some AR splice variants are insensitive to conventional hormonal or androgen deprivation therapy due to loss of the androgen ligand binding domain at the C-terminus and are constitutively active. Here we explore the use of RNA interference (RNAi) to target a universally conserved region of all AR splice variants for cleavage and degradation, thereby eliminating protein level resistance mechanisms. To this end, we tested five siRNA sequences designed against exon 1 of the AR mRNA and identified several that induced potent knockdown of full-length and truncated variant ARs in the 22Rv1 human prostate cancer cell line. We then demonstrated that 2'O methyl modification of the top candidate siRNA (siARvm) enhanced AR and AR-V7 mRNA silencing potency in both 22Rv1 and LNCaP cells, which represent two different prostate cancer models. For downstream in vivo delivery, we formulated siARvm-LNPs and functionally validated these in vitro by demonstrating knockdown of AR and AR-V7 mRNA in prostate cancer cells and loss of AR-mediated transcriptional activation of the PSA gene in both cell lines following treatment. We also observed that siARvm-LNP induced cell viability inhibition was more potent compared to LNP containing siRNA targeting full-length AR mRNA (siARfl-LNP) in 22Rv1 cells as their proliferation is more dependent on AR splice variants than LNCaP and PC3 cells. The in vivo biodistribution of siARvm-LNPs was determined in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice by incorporating 14C-radiolabelled DSPC in LNP formulation, and we observed a 4.4% ID/g tumor accumulation following intravenous administration. Finally, treatment of 22Rv1 tumor bearing mice with siARvm-LNP resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition and survival benefit compared to siARfl-LNP or the siLUC-LNP control.

The Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommends against screening for PCa but supports regional implementation of organised prostate cancer testing (OPT).  Objective:   To report the process for designing and implementing OPT programmes.  Design, setting, and participants:   Population-based OPT programmes in two Swedish regions, designed to include men aged between 50 and 74 yr, launched in September 2020 for 50-yr-old men.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The number of men invited, the participation rate, and the numbers of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, urological visits, and biopsies from September 2020 to June 2021 were recorded.  Results and limitations:   Two Swedish regions co-designed an OPT programme with a risk-stratified diagnostic algorithm based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, MRI findings, and age. An automated administrative system was developed on a nationwide web-based platform. Invitation letters and test results are automatically generated and sent out by post. Men with PSA â¥3ng/ml, a suspicious MRI lesion, and/or PSA density â¥0.15 ng/ml/cm3 are referred for a prostate biopsy. Test results are registered for quality control and research. By June 2021, a total of 16 515 men were invited, of whom 6309 (38%) participated; 147 had an MRI scan and 39 underwent prostate biopsy. The OPT framework, algorithm, and diagnostic pathways have been working well.  Conclusions:   We designed and implemented a framework for OPT with a high grade of automation. The framework and organisational experiences may be of value for others who plan a programme for early detection of PCa.

A PSAD cutoff of 0.1, 0.12 and 0.15 resulted in a negative predictive value (NPV) of 90.9%, 87.1% and 86.2%, respectively. When stratified by PI-RADS score, a PSAD cutoff of 0.1, 0.12 and 0.15 resulted in NPV of 96.2%, 90.6% and 89.7% and 86.2%, 84.2% and 83.3% for detection of csCaP in PI-RADS 2 and 3 lesions, respectively. In patients with PIRDAS 2 lesions, using a PSAD of 0.1 would potentially allow 51% of patients to avoid biopsy with only a 3.8% chance of missing csCaP.  Conclusion:   In men with clinical low-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance with PI-RADS 2 and 3 lesions, there is an almost 18% risk of upgrade to csCaP. Integration of PSAD may be a useful adjunctive tool in identifying patients at highest risk for upgrade despite favorable imaging findings. In men with PIRADS 2 lesions with PSAD â¤0.12 biopsy can be avoided. For men with PIRADS 2 lesions with PSAD â¤0.15 informed decision making regarding the AS intensity should include that these patients have a low risk (>10%) of developing csCaP. In men with PIRADS 3 lesions with PSAD >0.1, shared decision making should include discussion of a >10% miss rate of csCaP.""","""['Soum D Lokeshwar', 'Justin Nguyen', 'Syed N Rahman', 'Ghazal Khajir', 'Richard Ho', 'Kamyar Ghabili', 'Michael S Leapman', 'Jeffrey C Weinreb', 'Preston C Sprenkle']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['The use of 29 MHz transrectal micro-ultrasound to stratify the prostate cancer risk in patients with PI-RADS III lesions at multiparametric MRI: A single institutional analysis.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: Does the association of the lesion volume with the prostate-specific antigen density matter in the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer?', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Follow-up of Patients Included in Active Surveillance Protocol.

The SelectMDx (MDxHealth, Nijmegen, The Netherlands) test is a urinary-based biomarker test intended to be used to predict presence of high-grade PCa upon biopsy in men with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Previous validation of the SelectMDx test revealed that 53% of the unnecessary biopsies (biopsies indicating no- or GG1 PCa) could be avoided using the SelectMDx test as a decision-tool to select men for prostate biopsy. The objective of this study is to examine the use of the commercially available SelectMDx test under routine, real-life practice.  Methods:   Men that underwent a SelectMDx test between May 2019 and December 2020 and that were originating from countries that perform the SelectMDx test on a regular basis were included in this study, resulting in 5157 cases from 10 European countries. Clinical parameters, urinary RNA scores, and test outcomes were compared between PSA groups, age groups, countries, and the validation cohort (described previously [4]) using the Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-Square test, Benjamini-Hochberg and Kruskal-Wallis tests.  Results:   40.72% of the cases received a negative SelectMDx result. The test is also used in patients outside the intended-use population (PSA < 3 and >10 ng/mL). Clinical parameters (age, PSA density, DRE outcome) varied between patient population from individual countries and the validation cohort, resulting in differences in the potential number of saved biopsies using the test.  Conclusions:   The potential number of reduced biopsies in clinical use was 40,72% using the SelectMDx test, assuming a negative SelectMDx test resulted in the decision not to biopsy the patient.

Results:   During the study interval, we identified 193,490 patients who underwent TRUS-PB. The mean age was 57.6 years (SD: 5.0). Over time the unadjusted national rates of infectious complications remained similar from 0.4 ER visits per 100 prostate biopsies in 2010 -0.2 in 2015 (P = 0.83), and 1.2 hospital admissions per 100 prostate biopsies in 2010 to 1.1 in 2015 (P= 0.58).

Firstly, the stability and reactivity of compounds were determined by using the Guassian09 programme in which the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the B3LYP/SVP level. Among all the derivatives, the 7d, 7e, 7f, 7h, 7j, 7k, and 7m were found chemically reactive. Then the binding interactions of the optimized compounds within the active pocket of the selected targets were carried out by using molecular docking software: AutoDock tools and Molecular operation environment (MOE) software, and during analysis, the Autodock (academic software) results were found to be reproducible, suggesting this software is best over the MOE (commercial software). The results were found in correlation with the DFT results, suggesting 7d as the best inhibitor of AKR1B1 with the energy value of â49.40 kJ/mol and 7f as the best inhibitor of AKR1B10 with the energy value of â52.84 kJ/mol. The other potent compounds also showed comparable binding energies. The best inhibitors of both targets were validated by the molecular dynamics simulation studies where the root mean square value of <2 along with the other physicochemical properties, hydrogen bond interactions, and binding energies were observed. Furthermore, the anticancer potential of the potent compounds was confirmed by cell viability (MTT) assay. The studied compounds fall into the category of drug-like properties and also supported by physicochemical and pharmacological ADMET properties.

The five-year survival rate for men diagnosed with early-stage PCa is approximately 100%, while it is less than 30% for castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Currently, the detection of prostate-specific antigens as biomarkers for the prognosis of CRPC is criticized because of its low accuracy, high invasiveness, and high false-positive rate. Therefore, it is important to identify new biomarkers for prediction of CRPC progression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from tumors have been highlighted as potential markers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, urinary EVs directly reflect changes in the pathophysiological conditions of the urogenital system because it is exposed to prostatic secretions. Thus, detecting biomarkers in urinary EVs provides a promising approach for performing an accurate and non-invasive liquid biopsy for CPRC. In this study, we effectively isolated urinary EVs with low protein impurities using size-exclusion chromatography combined with ultrafiltration. After EV isolation and characterization, we evaluated the miRNAs in urinary EVs from healthy donors and patients with CRPC. The results indicated that miRNAs (miR-21-5p, miR-574-3p, and miR-6880-5p) could be used as potential biomarkers for the prognosis of CRPC. This analysis of urinary EVs contributes to the fast and convenient prognosis of diseases, including CRPC, in the clinical setting.""","""['Haneul Lee', 'Su Jin Kang', 'Jimin Lee', 'Kyong Hwa Park', 'Won Jong Rhee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Impact of Extracellular Vesicle Isolation Methods on Downstream Mirna Analysis in Semen: A Comparative Study.', 'Plasma extracellular vesicles as phenotypic biomarkers in prostate cancer patients.', 'Extracellular vesicles: the next generation of biomarkers for liquid biopsy-based prostate cancer diagnosis.', 'Novel, non-invasive markers for detecting therapy induced neuroendocrine differentiation in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Extracellular vesicles for liquid biopsy in prostate cancer: where are we and where are we headed?', 'Urinary MicroRNAs as Biomarkers of Urological Cancers: A Systematic Review.', 'Chromatographic-Based Platforms as New Avenues for Scientific Progress and Sustainability.', 'Size-Dependent Spontaneous Separation of Colloidal Particles in Sub-Microliter Suspension by Cations.']"""

This study assessed the effects of radiation and AuNPs on mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in cancer cells as an adjunct therapeutic target in addition to the DNA of the cell. Mitochondria are considered one of the primary sources of cellular ROS. High levels of ROS can result in an intracellular state of oxidative stress, leading to permanent cell damage. In this study, human melanoma and prostate cancer cell lines, with and without AuNPs, were irradiated with 6-Megavolt X-rays at doses of 0-8 Gy. Indicators of mitochondrial stress were quantified using two techniques, and were found to be significantly increased by the inclusion of AuNPs in both cell lines. Radiobiological damage to mitochondria was quantified via increased ROS activity. The ROS production by mitochondria in cells was enhanced by the inclusion of AuNPs, peaking at ~4 Gy and then decreasing at higher doses.

In recent years, the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has attracted attention as a therapeutic target due to its implication in tumorigenesis and metastasis in several types of cancer, including PCa. Although it is well-known that Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) is a transcriptional target of NF-ÎºB(p65), and that GLI1 is the effector of this crosstalk, the precise role played by this axis in PCa is still not completely clear. Here, we set out to explore the correlation between NF-ÎºB activation and SHh pathways in PCa, investigating if the interplay between NF-ÎºB(p65) and SHh-GLI1 in advanced PCa could be a prospective therapeutic target.

But cancer cells have a wide range of sensitivities to ferroptosis, which limits its therapeutic potential. Accumulation of lipid peroxides determines the occurrence of ferroptosis. However, the type of lipid involved in peroxidation and the mechanism of lipid peroxide accumulation are less studied.  Methods:   The effects of fatty acids (10 Î¼M) with different carbon chain length and unsaturation on ferroptosis were evaluated by MTT and LDH release assay in cell lines derived from prostate cancer (PC3, 22RV1, DU145 and LNCaP), colorectal cancer (HT-29), cervical cancer (HeLa) and liver cancer (HepG2). Inhibitors of apoptosis, necroptosis, autophagy and ferroptosis were used to determine the type of cell death. Then the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation by docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was measured by HPLC-MS and flow cytometry. The avtive form of DHA was determined by siRNA mediated gene silencing. The role of lipoxygenases was checked by inhibitors and gene silencing. Finally, the effect of DHA on ferroptosis-mediated tumor killing was verified in xenografts.  Results:   The sensitivity of ferroptosis was positively correlated with the unsaturation of exogenously added fatty acid. DHA (22:6 n-3) sensitized cancer cells to ferroptosis-inducing reagents (FINs) at the highest level in vitro and in vivo. In this process, DHA increased ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation independent of its membrane receptor, GPR120. Inhibition of long chain fatty acid-CoA ligases and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferases didn't affect the role of DHA. DHA-involved ferroptosis can be induced in both arachidonate lipoxygenase 5 (ALOX5) negative and positive cells. Down regulation of ALOX5 inhibited ferroptosis, while overexpression of ALOX5 promoted ferroptosis.  Conclusion:   DHA can effectively promote ferroptosis-mediated tumor killing by increasing intracellular lipid peroxidation. Both ALOX5 dependent and independent pathways are involved in DHA-FIN induced ferroptosis. And during this process, free DHA plays an important role.""","""['Kai Shan#', 'Ninghan Feng#', 'Doudou Zhu', 'Hongyan Qu', 'Guoling Fu', 'Jiaqi Li', 'Jing Cui', 'Heyan Chen', 'Rong Wang', 'Yumin Qi', 'Yong Q Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nutr""","""['Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids by lipoxygenases drives ferroptosis.', 'Low-density lipoprotein docosahexaenoic acid nanoparticles induce ferroptotic cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Lipoxygenase-mediated generation of lipid peroxides enhances ferroptosis induced by erastin and RSL3.', 'ROS-induced lipid peroxidation modulates cell death outcome: mechanisms behind apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis.', 'Ferroptosis: machinery and regulation.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'Docosahexaenoic Acid, a Key Compound for Enhancing Sensitization to Drug in Doxorubicin-Resistant MCF-7 Cell Line.', 'Repeated trans-arterial treatments of LDL-DHA nanoparticles induce multiple pathways of tumor cell death in hepatocellular carcinoma bearing rats.', 'Immunization Combined with Ferroptosis Related Genes to Construct a New Prognostic Model for Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.']"""

Methods:   Primary endpoint was cancer-specific and bone metastases-related HR-QoL, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and BM-22 questionnaires. Secondary endpoints were psychological distress and fatigue, evaluated by the HADS and CIS-Fatigue questionnaires. Outcomes were analyzed for the total cohort and between subgroups (1-3 versus 4-5 versus 6 radium-223 injections). A trajectory analysis was performed to explore HR-QoL patterns over time.  Results:   In total, 122 patients were included for analysis. Baseline HR-QoL, pain intensity, psychological distress and fatigue were worse in patients who did not complete radium-223 therapy. In patients who completed therapy, stabilization of HR-QoL was perceived and psychological distress and fatigue remained stable, whereas clinically meaningful and statistically significant deterioration of HR-QoL, psychological distress and fatigue over time was observed in patients who discontinued radium-223 therapy. Trajectory analysis revealed that HR-QoL deterioration over time was more likely in patients with baseline opioid use, low hemoglobin and high alkaline phosphatase levels.  Conclusions:   Patients who discontinued radium-223 therapy showed worse HR-QoL, psychological distress and fatigue at baseline and more frequent deterioration of HR-QoL, psychological distress and fatigue over time when compared to patients who completed therapy.

Here, we found that DNMT1 is highly expressed and facilitates PC cell proliferation and migration. Importantly, we demonstrate that the abrogation of DNMT1 expression can induce the decreased expression of EZH2, resulting in the less aggressive capacity of PC cells. Mechanistically, we discovered that DNMT1 promotes PC tumorigenesis and metastasis by inhibiting TRAF6 transcriptional expression and subsequent TRAF6-mediated EZH2 ubiquitination. Finally, we confirmed that there is a negative correlation between DNMT1 and TRAF6 expression and a positive correlation between DNMT1 and EZH2 expression in PC patients. In this study, we first disclose that there is a direct crosstalk between DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 expression and histone methyltransferase EZH2 expression in tumorigenesis and cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo.

However, cross-staining alignment of enormous gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) at single cell precision is difficult. Apart from gigantic data dimensions of WSIs, there are large variations on the cell appearance and tissue morphology across different staining together with morphological deformations caused by slide preparation. The goal of this study is to build an image registration framework for cross-staining alignment of gigapixel WSIs of histopathological and immunohistochemical microscopic slides and assess its clinical applicability. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first study to perform real time fully automatic cross staining alignment of WSIs with 40Ã and 20Ã objective magnification. The proposed WSI registration framework consists of a rapid global image registration module, a real time interactive field of view (FOV) localization model and a real time propagated multi-level image registration module. In this study, the proposed method is evaluated on two kinds of cancer datasets from two hospitals using different digital scanners, including a dual staining breast cancer data set with 43 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) WSIs and 43 immunohistochemical (IHC) CK(AE1/AE3) WSIs, and a triple staining prostate cancer data set containing 30 H&E WSIs, 30 IHC CK18 WSIs, and 30 IHC HMCK WSIs. In evaluation, the registration performance is measured by not only registration accuracy but also computational time. The results show that the proposed method achieves high accuracy of 0.833 Â± 0.0674 for the triple-staining prostate cancer data set and 0.931 Â± 0.0455 for the dual-staining breast cancer data set, respectively, and takes only 4.34 s per WSI registration on average. In addition, for 30.23% data, the proposed method takes less than 1 s for WSI registration.

Inter-reader agreement for the diagnostic quality was poor for T2w (kappa 0.19), fair for DWI and DCE (kappa 0.23 and 0.29) and moderate for PI-QUAL (kappa 0.51). For PI-RADS category assignments, inter-reader agreement was very good (kappa 0.86). Overall diagnostic performance did not differ between studies with a PI-QUAL score > 3 compared to a score â¤ 3 (p = 0.552; AUC 0.805 and 0.839). However, the prevalence of prostate cancer was significantly lower when the PI-QUAL score was â¤ 3 (16.7% vs. 30.2%, p = 0.008).  Conclusion:   PI-QUAL has only a limited impact on PI-RADS diagnostic performance in patients scheduled for MRI-TRUS fusion biopsy. However, the lower cancer prevalence in the lower PI-QUAL categories points out a risk of false-positive referrals and unnecessary biopsies if prostate imaging quality is low.""","""['N PÃ¶tsch', 'E Rainer', 'P Clauser', 'G Vatteroni', 'N HÃ¼bner', 'S Korn', 'S F Shariat', 'T H Helbich', 'P A T Baltzer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Radiol""","""['Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Impact of prostate imaging quality (PI-QUAL) score on the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer at biopsy.', 'Inter-reader agreement of the ESUR score for prostate MRI using in-bore MRI-guided biopsies as the reference standard.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Taking PI-QUAL beyond the prostate: Towards a standardized radiological image quality score (RI-QUAL).', 'PI-RADS: Where Next?', 'Role of the Prostate Imaging Quality PI-QUAL Score for Prostate Magnetic Resonance Image Quality in Pathological Upstaging After Radical Prostatectomy: A Multicentre European Study.', 'High-resolution 3D T2-weighted SPACE sequence with compressed sensing for the prostate gland: diagnostic performance in comparison with conventional T2-weighted images.']"""

Various radioiodinated PSMA imaging probes have been developed, and their structure has a peptidomimetic urea-based skeleton as a pharmacophore. For direct radioiodination of molecules containing these peptidomimetic structures, prior studies performed radioiododestannylation or electrophilic radioiodination of tyrosine residues. However, although these radiolabeling methods are frequently used, there are some issues with precursor toxicity and by-product production. Therefore, it is required to investigate a radiolabeling method that can be used for the radiosynthesis of radioiodinated PSMA imaging probes with urea-based peptidomimetic structures. We recently reported that copper-mediated radioiodination via a boronic precursor is an effective method for directly labeling a peptide. This radiohalogenation method was expected to be an effective method for radiosynthesis of PSMA imaging probes with a peptidomimetic structure. In this study, to confirm that this labeling method applies to the synthesis of the PSMA imaging probe, we synthesized PSMA imaging probes labeled with 125I and 77Br ([125I]mIB-PS and [77Br]mBrB-PS) using a copper-mediated radiohalogenation via common boronic precursors and investigated optimal boronic precursor and labeling conditions. As a result, the radiochemical yields of [125I]mIB-PS and [77Br]mBrB-PS were improved to > 93% at room temperature by optimizing the structure of the boronic precursor. We demonstrate that copper-mediated nucleophilic radiochemistry using a boronic precursor is a promising radiosynthetic method of PSMA imaging probes. Although we focused on the synthesis of PSMA imaging probes, the results in this study will also be useful for the synthesis of various radioiodine or radiobromine-labeled bioactive molecules.""","""['Yuto Kondo', 'Hiroyuki Kimura', 'Ichiro Sasaki', 'Shigeki Watanabe', 'Yasuhiro Ohshima', 'Yusuke Yagi', 'Yasunao Hattori', 'Manami Koda', 'Hidekazu Kawashima', 'Hiroyuki Yasui', 'Noriko S Ishioka']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem""","""['Synthesis and Biologic Evaluation of Novel 18F-Labeled Probes Targeting Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen for PET of Prostate Cancer.', 'Copper-mediated radioiodination reaction through aryl boronic acid or ester precursor and its application to direct radiolabeling of a cyclic peptide.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Inhibitors of prostate-specific membrane antigen in the diagnosis and therapy of metastatic prostate cancer - a review of patent literature.', '18F-Labeled, PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Leveraging the Advantages of Radiofluorination for Prostate Cancer Molecular Imaging.', 'Effect of Water on Direct Radioiodination of Small Molecules/Peptides Using Copper-Mediated Iododeboronation in Water-Alcohol Solvent.', 'Pretargeted Alpha Therapy of Disseminated Cancer Combining Click Chemistry and Astatine-211.', 'Copper-Mediated Radiobromination of (Hetero)Aryl Boronic Pinacol Esters.']"""

Prostate cancer-induced bone formation originates from endothelial cells (EC) that have undergone endothelial-to-osteoblast (EC-to-OSB) transition in response to tumor-secreted BMP4. Current strategies targeting prostate cancer-induced bone formation are lacking. Here, we show that activation of retinoic acid receptor (RAR) inhibits EC-to-OSB transition and reduces prostate cancer-induced bone formation. Treatment with palovarotene, an RARÎ³ agonist being tested for heterotopic ossification in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, inhibited EC-to-OSB transition and osteoblast mineralization in vitro and decreased tumor-induced bone formation and tumor growth in several osteogenic prostate cancer models, and similar effects were observed with the pan-RAR agonist all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). Knockdown of RARÎ±, Î², or Î³ isoforms in ECs blocked BMP4-induced EC-to-OSB transition and osteoblast mineralization, indicating a role for all three isoforms in prostate cancer-induced bone formation. Furthermore, treatment with palovarotene or ATRA reduced plasma Tenascin C, a factor secreted from EC-OSB cells, which may be used to monitor treatment response. Mechanistically, BMP4-activated pSmad1 formed a complex with RAR in the nucleus of ECs to activate EC-to-OSB transition. RAR activation by palovarotene or ATRA caused pSmad1 degradation by recruiting the E3-ubiquitin ligase Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor1 (Smurf1) to the nuclear pSmad1/RARÎ³ complex, thus blocking EC-to-OSB transition. Collectively, these findings suggest that palovarotene can be repurposed to target prostate cancer-induced bone formation to improve clinical outcomes for patients with bone metastasis.  Significance:   This study provides mechanistic insights into how RAR agonists suppress prostate cancer-induced bone formation and offers a rationale for developing RAR agonists for prostate cancer bone metastasis therapy.

Among men testing positive for COVID-19, we used regression analyses to estimate the association between ADT and risk of COVID-19-related hospital admission/death from any cause within 30 days of the positive test. In total, 1695 men with prostate cancer tested positive for COVID-19. In crude analyses, exposure to ADT was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of both testing positive for COVID-19 infection and subsequent hospital admission/death.

In this study, we validated the performance of the PRS in the multi-ancestry Million Veteran Program and additional independent studies.  Methods:   Within each ancestry population, the association of PRS with prostate cancer risk was evaluated separately in each case-control study and then combined in a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. We further assessed the effect modification by age and estimated the age-specific absolute risk of prostate cancer for each ancestry population.  Results:   The PRS was evaluated in 31,925 cases and 490,507 controls, including men from European (22,049 cases, 414,249 controls), African (8794 cases, 55,657 controls), and Hispanic (1082 cases, 20,601 controls) populations. Comparing men in the top decile (90-100% of the PRS) to the average 40-60% PRS category, the prostate cancer odds ratio (OR) was 3.8-fold in European ancestry men (95% CI = 3.62-3.96), 2.8-fold in African ancestry men (95% CI = 2.59-3.03), and 3.2-fold in Hispanic men (95% CI = 2.64-3.92). The PRS did not discriminate risk of aggressive versus nonaggressive prostate cancer. However, the OR diminished with advancing age (European ancestry men in the top decile: â¤55 years, OR = 7.11; 55-60 years, OR = 4.26; >70 years, OR = 2.79). Men in the top PRS decile reached 5% absolute prostate cancer risk ~10 years younger than men in the 40-60% PRS category.  Conclusions:   Our findings validate the multi-ancestry PRS as an effective prostate cancer risk stratification tool across populations. A clinical study of PRS is warranted to determine whether the PRS could be used for risk-stratified screening and early detection.

Despite the useful nuclear properties of 201Tl, satisfactory bifunctional chelators to incorporate it into bioconjugates for molecular targeting have not been developed. H4pypa, H5decapa, H4neunpa-NH2, and H4noneunpa are multidentate N- and O-donor chelators that have previously been shown to have high affinity for 111In, 177Lu, and 89Zr. Herein, we report the synthesis and serum stability of [nat/201Tl]Tl3+ complexes with H4pypa, H5decapa, H4neunpa-NH2, and H4noneunpa. All ligands quickly and efficiently formed complexes with [201Tl]Tl3+ that gave simple single-peak radiochromatograms and showed greatly improved serum stability compared to DOTA and DTPA. [natTl]Tl-pypa was further characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), mass spectroscopy (MS), and X-ray crystallography, showing evidence of the proton-dependent presence of a nine-coordinate complex and an eight-coordinate complex with a pendant carboxylic acid group. A prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting bioconjugate of H4pypa was synthesized and radiolabeled. The uptake of [201Tl]Tl-pypa-PSMA in DU145 PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative prostate cancer cells was evaluated in vitro and showed evidence of bioreductive release of 201Tl and cellular uptake characteristic of unchelated [201Tl]TlCl. SPECT/CT imaging was used to probe the in vivo biodistribution and stability of [201Tl]Tl-pypa-PSMA. In healthy animals, [201Tl]Tl-pypa-PSMA did not show the myocardial uptake that is characteristic of unchelated 201Tl. In mice bearing DU145 PSMA-positive and PSMA-negative prostate cancer xenografts, the uptake of [201Tl]Tl-pypa-PSMA in DU145 PSMA-positive tumors was higher than that in DU145 PSMA-negative tumors but insufficient for useful tumor targeting. We conclude that H4pypa and related ligands represent an advance compared to conventional radiometal chelators such as DOTA and DTPA for Tl3+ chelation but do not resist dissociation for long periods in the biological environment due to vulnerability to reduction of Tl3+ and subsequent release of Tl+. However, this is the first report describing the incorporation of [201Tl]Tl3+ into a chelator-peptide bioconjugate and represents a significant advance in the field of 201Tl-based radiopharmaceuticals. The design of the next generation of chelators must include features to mitigate this susceptibility to bioreduction, which does not arise for other trivalent heavy radiometals.""","""['Alex Rigby', 'George Firth', 'Charlotte Rivas', 'Truc Pham', 'Jana Kim', 'Andreas Phanopoulos', 'Luke Wharton', 'Aidan Ingham', 'Lily Li', 'Michelle T Ma', 'Chris Orvig', 'Philip J Blower', 'Samantha Y A Terry', 'Vincenzo Abbate']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioconjug Chem""","""['Functionally Versatile and Highly Stable Chelator for 111In and 177Lu: Proof-of-Principle Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting.', 'Assessment of PSMA targeting ligands bearing novel chelates with application to theranostics: Stability and complexation kinetics of 68Ga3+, 111In3+, 177Lu3+ and 225Ac3.', 'Design, synthesis, and preclinical evaluation of a novel bifunctional macrocyclic chelator for theranostics of cancers.', 'Current Status of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Targeting in Nuclear Medicine: Clinical Translation of Chelator Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands Into Diagnostics and Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Bispecific radioligands targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen and gastrin-releasing peptide receptors on the surface of prostate cancer cells.']"""

Methods:   The GSE70768, GSE88808, and GSE134051 datasets were downloaded to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEG screening criteria were as follows: P < 0.05 and differential fold change |logFC| â¥ 1. The common DEGs (co-DEGs) of the three datasets were obtained by the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) method. Gene Ontology (GO) function annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed using R software. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis was performed for co-DEGs using STRING to screen critical genes. Differential expression and prognosis of key genes were analyzed by the online tool Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2). The intersection gene between key genes and neurodegenerative genes was identified by constructing a Venn diagram.  Results:   A total of 263 co-DEGs were identified from the three datasets. GO analysis showed that co-DEGs were mainly involved in muscle contraction and blood circulation regulation. The top ten key genes were ACTG2, APOE, F5, CALD1, MYH11, MYL9, MYLK, TPM1, TPM2, and CALM1. GEPIA2 analysis showed that APOE, MYH11, and MYLK differ dramatically between tumor and normal tissues.

To date, there is no evidence regarding the prognostic value of baseline health-related quality of life for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy due to localized prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 1,029 patients with high-risk prostate cancer according to National Comprehensive Cancer NetworkÂ® risk stratification and prospectively assessed baseline health-related quality of life prior to radical prostatectomy were identified. Patients were stratified by global health status domain of the QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Oncologic endpoints were biochemical recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival. Multivariable Cox regression models were performed to assess prognostic significance of baseline global health status on survival outcomes. Harrell's discrimination C-index was applied to calculate the predictive accuracy of the model and previously described risk stratification models. Decision curve analysis was applied to test the clinical net benefit associated with adding global health status to our multivariable model (P < .05).  Results:   Median follow-up was 43 months. In multivariable analysis, global health status was confirmed as an independent predictor for increased biochemical recurrence-free survival (HR .97, 95% CI .96-.99; P = .001) and metastasis-free survival (HR .96, 95% CI .93-.99; P = .013), indicating a relative risk reduction of 2.9% for biochemical recurrence-free survival and 3.7% for metastasis-free survival per 1-point increase of baseline global health status. Adding baseline health-related quality of life to our model and to the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment and National Comprehensive Cancer Network score improved discrimination in predicting biochemical recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival of the respective models. Decision curve analysis revealed a net benefit over all threshold probabilities.  Conclusions:   Our findings highlight baseline health-related quality of life to be a valuable and robust prognostic factor for patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer prior to radical prostatectomy.

Results:   Overall, 538 (58%) vs 89 (10%) vs 299 (32%) patients received adjuvant radiotherapy vs early salvage radiotherapy vs observation. The 10-year overall survival rate was 90%. A significant interaction between adjuvant radiotherapy and high-risk group was recorded (HR 0.21, P = .04). After risk stratification and propensity-score weighting, survival analyses depicted comparable 10-year overall survival in low- and intermediate-risk patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy or observation Â± early salvage radiotherapy.

Several studies suggested that these secondary metabolites have health benefits due to its anti-tumorigenic effect. Therefore, substantial effort has been put forward to isolate and characterize these natural compounds and synthesize analogues that may serve as potential anti-cancer therapeutics. This present study is aimed at designing and synthesis of azaflavanone derivative and in understanding its mechanism of action in vitro and in vivo. Molecular docking studies predicted that the compound can potentially bind strongly to the Cyclin E1-Cdk2 complex which is a key mediator of the cell cycle progression indicating a biological interference in aggressive prostate cancer. Further downstream studies to understand its cytotoxicity and mechanism of action showed this azaflavanone derivative markedly inhibits viability of prostate cancer cells (DU145) showing an IC50 value of 0.4 Î¼M compared to other cancer cells. The pharmacological ROS insult using the azaflavanone derivative increases the oxidative damage leading to high expression of apoptotic markers with increasing concentration. On compound treatment, the cells lose the metabolic flexibility accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.

Data-driven competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network modeling is an effective way to decipher the complex interplay between miRNAs and spongers. However, there are currently no general rules for ceRNA network-based biomarker prioritization.  Methods and results:   In this study, a novel bioinformatics model was developed by integrating gene expression with multivariate miRNA-target data for ceRNA network-based biomarker discovery. Compared with traditional methods, the structural vulnerability in the human long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-miRNA-messenger RNAs (mRNA) network was comprehensively analyzed, and the single-line regulatory or competing mode among miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs was characterized and quantified as statistical evidence for miRNA biomarker identification. The application of this model to prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis identified a total of 12 miRNAs as putative biomarkers from the metastatic PCa-specific lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network and nine of them have been previously reported as biomarkers for PCa metastasis. The receiver operating characteristic curve and cell line qRT-PCR experiments demonstrated the power of miR-26b-5p, miR-130a-3p, and miR-363-3p as novel candidates for predicting PCa metastasis. Moreover, PCa-associated pathways such as prostate cancer signaling, ERK/MAPK signaling, and TGF-Î² signaling were significantly enriched by targets of identified miRNAs, indicating the underlying mechanisms of miRNAs in PCa carcinogenesis.  Conclusions:   A novel ceRNA-based bioinformatics model was proposed and applied to screen candidate miRNA biomarkers for PCa metastasis.

Long-term ADT treatment likely develops side-effects that include changes in cognition or onset of dementia. However, the molecular understanding of this effect remains elusive. We attempt to establish a link between ADT and changes in cognitive function using patient databases and bioinformatics analyses.  Methods:   Gene expression profiling was performed using RNA sequencing data from Alzheimer patient cohort and compared with the data from advanced-stage prostate cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant antiandrogen therapy. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the Ingenuity knowledge database.  Results:   A total of 1952 DEGs in the Alzheimer patient cohort and 101 DEGs were identified in ADT treated prostate cancer patients. Comparing both data sets provided a subset of 33 commonly expressed genes involving cytokine-cytokine signaling with an over representation of cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, inflammatory cytokines, signaling by interleukins together with alterations in the circulating lymphocyte repertoire, adaptive immune responses, regulation of cytokine production, and changes in T-cell subsets. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor, and toll-like receptors were identified as upstream transcriptional regulators of these pathways. The most commonly expressed genes viz. IL-17A, CCL2, IL-10, IL-6, IL-1RN, LIF/LIFR were further validated by quantitative RT-PCR exhibited higher expression in antiandrogen treated neuronal, glial, and androgen-responsive prostate cancer cells, compared to no-androgen antagonist treatment.

Prostatic gene expression was measured using qPCR and BPH cells were used in organoid culture to study prostatic branching.  Results:   BPH patients on 5-Î±-reductase inhibitor (5ARI) showed low levels of tissue dihydrotestosterone (DHT), increased levels of steroid 5-Î±-reductase type II (SRD5A2), and diminished levels of androgen receptor (AR) target genes, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2). 5ARI raised prostatic tissue levels of glucocorticoids (GC), whereas alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonists (Î±-blockers) did not. Nuclear localization of GR in prostatic epithelium and stroma appeared in all patient samples. Treatment of four BPH organoid cell lines with dexamethasone, a synthetic GC, resulted in budding and branching.  Conclusions:   After failure of medical therapy for BPH/LUTS, 5ARI therapy continued to inhibit androgenesis but a 5ARI-induced pathway increased tissue levels of GC not seen in patients on Î±-blockers.

Objective:   To compare cost (US dollars) and time requirements of conducting a platform trial vs a series of conventional (nonplatform) trials using a real-life example.  Design, setting, and participants:   For this economic evaluation, an online survey was administered to a group of international experts (146 participants) with publication records of platform trials to elicit their opinions on cost and time to set up and conduct platform, multigroup, and 2-group trials. Using the reported entry dates of 10 interventions into Systemic Therapy in Advancing Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy, the longest ongoing platform trial, 3 scenarios were designed involving a single platform trial (scenario 1), 1 multigroup followed by 5 2-group trials (scenario 2), and a series of 10 2-group trials (scenario 3). All scenarios started with 5 interventions, then 5 more interventions were either added to the platform or evaluated independently. Simulations with the survey results as inputs were used to compare the platform vs conventional trial designs. Data were analyzed from July to September 2021.  Exposure:   Platform trial design.  Main outcomes and measures:   Total trial setup and conduct cost and cumulative duration.  Results:   Although setup time and cost requirements of a single trial were highest for the platform trial, cumulative requirements of setting up a series of multiple trials in scenarios 2 and 3 were larger. Compared with the platform trial, there was a median (IQR) increase of 216.7% (202.2%-242.5%) in cumulative setup costs for scenario 2 and 391.1% (365.3%-437.9%) for scenario 3.

A predicted risk threshold of 12% could have prevented 25% of biopsies while detecting almost 95% of CSPCas with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 34%.  Conclusions:   For PI-RADS 3 lesions, an elevated PSA density, older age, and a biopsy-naive status were associated with CSPCa, whereas a prior negative biopsy was negatively associated. A predictive model could prevent PI-RADS 3 biopsies while missing few CSPCas.  Lay summary:   Among men with an equivocal lesion (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System 3) on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), those who are older, those who have a higher prostate-specific antigen density, and those who have never had a biopsy before are at higher risk for having clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa) on subsequent biopsy. However, men with at least one negative biopsy have a lower risk of CSPCa. A new predictive model can greatly reduce the need to biopsy equivocal lesions noted on mpMRI while missing only a few cases of CSPCa.""","""['Andrew M Fang', 'Luke A Shumaker', 'Kimberly D Martin', 'Jamaal C Jackson', 'Richard E Fan', 'Ghazal Khajir', 'Hiten D Patel', 'Nachiketh Soodana-Prakash', 'Srinivas Vourganti', 'Christopher P Filson', 'Geoffrey A Sonn', 'Preston C Sprenkle', 'Gopal N Gupta', 'Sanoj Punnen', 'Soroush Rais-Bahrami']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Micro-ultrasound may significantly reduce the proportion of unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions.', 'Reply to ""Micro-ultrasound may significantly reduce the proportion of unnecessary prostate biopsies in patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions"".', 'How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-naÃ¯ve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009â¤\u20093?', 'Association Between Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Score for the Index Lesion and Multifocal, Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate biopsy in the era of MRI-targeting: towards a judicious use of additional systematic biopsy.', 'Positive Predictive Value of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Version 2 for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Multivariate risk prediction tools including MRI for individualized biopsy decision in prostate cancer diagnosis: current status and future directions.', 'PI-RADS 3 lesions: a critical review and discussion of how to improve management.']"""

Material and methods:   Non-inferiority comparative cross-sectional study between fusion-guided prostate biopsy results. 344 patients with clinical suspicion of prostate cancer (elevated PSA and/or suspicious DRE) and mpMRI interpreted and verified by the same radiologists in all cases, 270 in 1.5-Tesla and 74 in 3-Tesla, with at least one lesion PIRADSv2â¥ 3. Exclusion criteria were positive biopsy or previous prostate treatment. We consider malignancy as ISUPâ¥ 1 and significant tumor as ISUPâ¥ 2. We used Wilcoxon and t-student test (central tendency measures), diagnostic test (gold standard: ISUP of targeted biopsy), Chi2 test and Z-test (comparison of prevalences and 95%CI malignancy and significant tumor according to mpMRI).  Results:   Median prostate volume 50cc(IQR:33.5) and PSA 6.11ng/ml(IQR:3.39). Mean age 67.4Â±8.1years. Number of suspi-cious lesions/patient: mpMRI 1.3 (1.5-Tesla) and 1.5 (3-Tesla).

In our study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between cribriform morphology and biochemical recurrence in patients with moderate-risk localized PCa with a Gleason score of 3+4 (ISUP grade 2) after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Datas of 177 patients in the moderate-risk group who were evaluated as ISUP grade 2 after radical prostatectomy were retrospectively evaluated. Patients were divided into 2 groups as without (Group 1) and with biochemical recurrence (Group 2).

However, little is known about the associations between EXTL3 and prostate cancer (PCa). Hence, this article was designed to clarify their associations.  Methods:   All original data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and CellMiner database was utilized, respectively, to identify EXTL3-related signaling pathways and drugs. We explored the relationships between EXTL3 expression and immunity to further evaluate the involvement of EXTL3 in response to immunotherapies. LncRNA/RBP/EXTL3 mRNA networks were also identified for its potential mechanism.  Results:   Compared with normal prostate samples, EXTL3 was poorly expressed in PCa samples not only in mRNA expression levels, but also in protein expression levels, with worse overall survival (P < 0.05) and this gene could be an independent prognostic biomarker for PCa (both P < 0.05). EXTL3 was revealed to be markedly linked with seven signaling pathways in PCa by GSEA, including calcium, chemokine, ERBB, JAK STAT, MAPK, WNT, oxidative phosphorylation pathways. EXTL3 expression was also revealed to be significantly associated with MSI, immune cells, immune checkpoint molecules, tumor microenvironment and immune cells infiltration. We further predicted immune responses of EXTL3 gene to immunotherapies by TIDE database and the IMvigor210 cohort. A total of six LncRNA/RBP/EXTL3 mRNA networks were eventually identified for its potential mechanisms.

DNA Methylation data for cancer patients are becoming more accessible than ever, which is attributed to newer DNA sequencing technologies, notably, the relatively low-cost DNA microarray technology by Illumina Infinium. This technology makes it possible to study DNA methylation at hundreds of thousands of different loci. Currently, most of the research found in the literature focuses on the discovery of DNA methylation markers for specific cancer types. A relatively small number of studies have attempted to find unified DNA methylation biomarkers that can diagnose different types of cancer (pan-cancer classification).  Results:   In this study, the aim is to conduct a pan-classification of cancer disease. We retrieved individual data for different types of cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) portal. We selected data for many cancer types: Breast Cancer (BRCA), Ovary Cancer (OV), Stomach Cancer (STOMACH), Colon Cancer (COAD), Kidney Cancer (KIRC), Liver Cancer (LIHC), Lung Cancer (LUSC), Prostate Cancer (PRAD) and Thyroid cancer (THCA). The data was pre-processed and later used to build the required dataset. The system that we developed consists of two main stages. The purpose of the first stage is to perform feature selection and, therefore, decrease the dimensionality of the DNA methylation loci (features). This is accomplished using an unsupervised metaheuristic technique. As for the second stage, we used supervised machine learning and developed deep neural network (DNN) models to help classify the samples' malignancy status and cancer type. Experimental results showed that compared to recently published methods, our proposed system achieved better classification results in terms of recall, and similar and higher results in terms of precision and accuracy. The proposed system also achieved an excellent receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) values varying from 0.85 to 0.89.  Conclusions:   This research presented an effective new approach to classify different cancer types based on DNA methylation data retrieved from TCGA. The performance of the proposed system was compared to recently published works, using different performance metrics. It provided better results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method for classifying different cancer types based on DNA methylation data.""","""['Noureldin S Eissa', 'Uswah Khairuddin', 'Rubiyah Yusof']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['A Linear Regression and Deep Learning Approach for Detecting Reliable Genetic Alterations in Cancer Using DNA Methylation and Gene Expression Data.', 'Classification of early and late stage liver hepatocellular carcinoma patients from their genomics and epigenomics profiles.', 'PreMSIm: An R package for predicting microsatellite instability from the expression profiling of a gene panel in cancer.', 'Application of Feature Selection and Deep Learning for Cancer Prediction Using DNA Methylation Markers.', 'The molecular feature of macrophages in tumor immune microenvironment of glioma patients.', 'The Binomial ""Inflammation-Epigenetics"" in Breast Cancer Progression and Bone Metastasis: IL-1Î² Actions Are Influenced by TET Inhibitor in MCF-7 Cell Line.']"""

Nowadays, the application of multi-parameter magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT has further improved the imaging diagnosis of prostate cancer, and the diagnostic accuracy of clinically significant prostate cancer has reached almost 100%. In addition, minimally invasive techniques represented by robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery have developed rapidly, and the safety and postoperative recovery of radical prostatectomy have been significantly improved. Therefore, we proposed the concept of radical prostatectomy avoiding biopsy (RPAB), that is, the patients with high suspicion of prostate cancer by multi-parameter MRI and PSMA PET/CT can be directly treated by radical surgery. Preliminary clinical practice confirmed that this concept is feasible. However, RPAB is not suitable for all prostate cancer patients, and any new concept needs to be supported by long-term and high-quality clinical studies.

The existing evidence shows that lncRNAs compete with miRNAs for binding sites and contribute to the onset and progression of human malignancies. In this study we investigate how endosulfan promotes cell migration and invasion in DU145 and PC3 prostate cancer cells through epigenetic mechanism of lncRNA-miRNA regulation. Based on our past research we focused on PTP4A3 and constructed wild-type (WT) and mutant PTP4A3 plasmids for further analysis. Our results revealed that transfection of PTP4A3-WT can lead to changes in the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) biomarkers and critical proteins in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway, and promote cell migration and invasion in PCa cells. Bioinformatics analysis shows that there were complementary sequences in PTP4A3 3'-UTR and KCNQ1OT1 3'-UTR to the seed sequence of hsa-miR-137-3p, and dual luciferase reporter assay indicates the potential binding capacity of miR-137-3p to 3'-UTR of PTP4A3 and KCNQ1OT1. We found that miR-137-3p mimic inhibited cell migration and invasion, as well as repressed alterations of EMT biomarkers and critical proteins in the TGF-Î² signaling pathway. Rescue experiment results revealed that co-transfection of miR-137-3p mimic and PTP4A3-WT plasmid reversed these changes following transfection with miR-137-3p mimic alone.

Furthermore, overexpression of miR-137-3p or silencing of KCNQ1OT1 dramatically rescued the effects of endosulfan on promoting cell migration and invasion.

However, the genetic factors contributing to prostate cancer susceptibility in AA families remain poorly understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing of one affected and one unaffected brother in an AA family with hereditary prostate cancer. The novel non-synonymous variants discovered only in the affected individuals were further analyzed in all affected and unaffected men in 20 AA-PC families. Here, we report one rare recurrent ADPRHL1 germline mutation (c.A233T; p.D78V) in four of the 20 families affected by prostate cancer. The mutation co-segregates with prostate cancer in two families and presents in two affected men in the other two families, but was absent in 170 unrelated healthy AA men. Functional characterization of the mutation in benign prostate cells showed aberrant promotion of cell proliferation, whereas expression of the wild-type ADPRHL1 in prostate cancer cells suppressed cell proliferation and oncogenesis. Mechanistically, the ADPRHL1 mutant activates PARP1, leading to an increased H2O2 or cisplatin-induced DNA damage response for prostate cancer cell survival. Indeed, the PARP1 inhibitor, olaparib, suppresses prostate cancer cell survival induced by mutant ADPRHL1. Given that the expression levels of ADPRHL1 are significantly high in normal prostate tissues and reduce stepwise as Gleason scores increase in tumors, our findings provide genetic, biochemical, and clinicopathological evidence that ADPRHL1 is a tumor suppressor in prostate tissue. A loss of function mutation in ADPRHL1 induces prostate tumorigenesis and confers prostate cancer susceptibility in high-risk AA families.

Therefore, intensive efforts are underway to better target cancer-specific cells while minimizing the side effects on healthy tissues by using LDL particles as active drug delivery vehicles. The goal is to encapsulate anticancer agents thiosemicarbazone metal-ligand complexes into LDL particles to increase the cytotoxic effect of the agent by internalization through LDL receptors into MCF7, A549, and C42 cancer cell lines as segregate models for biological evaluations targeting tubulin. Zeta potential data of LDL-particles encapsulated anticancer agents showed an acceptable diameter range between 66-91 nm and uniform particle morphology. The results showed cell proliferation reduction in all tested cell lines. The IC50 values of LDL encapsulated thiosemicarbazone metal-ligand complexes treated with MCF7, A549, and C42 ranged between 1.18-6.61 ÂµM, 1.17-9.66 ÂµM, and 1.01-6.62 ÂµM, respectively.

Likert scores have been shown to better predict clinically significant cancer (csPCa) but are subjective and lack standardization.  Purpose:   To compare differences in outcomes between the scoring systems and create a mathematical tool that can help to objectively allocate Likert scores.  Material and methods:   A total of 791 patients referred with query prostate cancer between 2017 and 2019 were prospectively allocated PI-RADS and Likert scores by a single experienced reporter.

Nevertheless, how inflammatory factors coordinate with fructose metabolism to facilitate tumor growth remains largely elusive. Here we show that treatment with IL-6 activates fructose uptake and fructolysis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells and prostate cancer cells. Mechanistic study shows that transcription factor STAT3 associates with Glut5 promoter region and enhances Glut5 transcription in response to IL-6 treatment. Knockdown of Glut5 abolished IL-6-induced fructose uptake and utilization of fructose, and compromises IL-6-elicited tumor cell proliferation.

Transcriptional characteristics have recently been found to have a predictive power for the infiltration of Tregs. Thus, a novel machine learning-based computational framework has been presented using Tregs and 19 other immune cell types using 42 purified immune cell datasets from GEO to identify Treg-specific mRNAs, and a prognostic signature of Tregs (named ""TILTregSig"") consisting of five mRNAs (SOCS2, EGR1, RRM2, TPP1, and C11orf54) was developed and validated to monitor the prognosis of prostate cancer using the TCGA and ICGC datasets. The TILTregSig showed a stronger predictive power for tumor immunity compared with tumor mutation burden and glycolytic activity, which have been reported as immune predictors. Further analyses indicate that the TILTregSig might influence tumor immunity mainly by mediating tumor-infiltrating Tregs and could be a powerful predictor for Tregs in prostate cancer. Moreover, the TILTregSig showed a promising potential for predicting cancer immunotherapy (CIT) response in five CIT response datasets and therapeutic resistance in the GSCALite dataset in multiple cancers.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional and clinical significance of miR-99b in PCa.  Study design:   The expression of miR-99b and its downstream targets mTOR/AR in the PCa samples were analyzed by RT/qPCR. The effects of miR-99b overexpression/inhibition on PCa cell survival/proliferation, spheroid formation, and cell migration were examined by specific assays. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to determine the binding of miR-99b to 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mTOR gene. The effects of miR-99b on the expression of mTOR, AR, and PSA proteins, as well as on AKT/mTOR signaling, autophagy, and neuroendocrine differentiation markers were analyzed by western blotting. The expression of miR-99b, mTOR, AR, PSA in AR-negative PC3 and AR-positive LNCaP cells was analyzed by RT/qPCR. The effect of miR-99b on global gene expression in PC3 cells was analyzed by RNA-seq.  Results:   The expression of miR-99b was downregulated in tumor samples from PCa patients, whereas the expression of mTOR and AR was upregulated. In PCa cell lines, overexpression of miR-99b inhibited cell proliferation and cell colony/spheroid formation; induced apoptosis, and increased sensitivity towards docetaxel (DTX). In contrast, inhibition of miR-99b by miR-99b inhibitor resulted in increased cell growth in PCa cells. Mechanistically, miR-99b inhibited the expression of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) gene by binding to its 3' UTR and induced autophagy. Furthermore, miR-99b inhibited androgen receptor (AR) activity in LNCaP cells and induced apoptosis. Activation of AR signaling by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) downregulated miR-99b expression and promoted cell PCa cell growth/survival, whereas inactivation of mTOR by rapamycin or AR by enzalutamide decreased miR-99b mediated PCa cell growth.

Although it is well known that it shows deacetylase activity for energy metabolism, little is understood about its function in tumorigenesis. Recent research suggests that SIRT4 may work as both a tumor suppressor gene and an oncogene. However, the clinical significance of SIRT4 in prostate cancer remains unknown. In this study, we evaluated SIRT4 protein levels in cancerous prostate tissue and corresponding non-tumor prostate tissue via immunohistochemical staining on a tissue microarray including tissues from 89 prostate cancer patients. The association between SIRT4 expression and Gleason score was also determined. Further, shSIRT4 or stable prostate cancer cell lines (22RV1) overexpressing SIRT4 were constructed via lentiviral infection. Using Cell-Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound healing assay, migration, and invasion and apoptosis assays, the effects of SIRT4 on the migration, invasion ability, and proliferation of prostate cancer cells were investigated. We also determined the effect of SIRT4 on glutamine metabolism in 22RV1 cells. We found the protein levels of SIRT4 in prostate cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in their non-neoplastic tissue counterparts (P < 0.01); a lower SIRT4 level was also significantly associated with a higher Gleason score (P < 0.01). SIRT4 suppressed the migration, invasion capabilities, and proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induced cellular apoptosis. Furthermore, the invasion and migration of 22RV1 cells were mechanistically inhibited by SIRT4 via glutamine metabolism inhibition. In conclusion, the present study's findings showed that SIRT4 protein levels are significantly associated with the Gleason score in patients with prostate cancer, and SIRT4 exerts a tumor-suppressive effect on prostate cancer cells by inhibiting glutamine metabolism.

We also analyzed well-characterized PCa cohorts to determine their transcript levels, identify genetic alterations, and assess promoter methylation of PP1c-coding genes. We found that PP-1A was upregulated and relocalized towards the nucleus in PCa and that PPP1CA was frequently amplified in PCa, particularly in advanced stages. PP-1B was downregulated in PCa but upregulated in a subset of tumors with AR amplification. PP-1G transcript levels were found to be associated with Gleason score. PP1c-coding genes were rarely mutated in PCa and were not prone to regulation by promoter methylation. Protein phosphorylation, on the other hand, might be an important regulatory mechanism of PP1c isoforms' activity.

This limits both reproducibility and comparability.  Methods:   Prostate158 consists of 158 expert annotated biparametric 3T prostate MRIs comprising T2w sequences and diffusion-weighted sequences with apparent diffusion coefficient maps. Two U-ResNets trained for segmentation of anatomy (central gland, peripheral zone) and suspicious lesions for prostate cancer (PCa) with a PI-RADS score of â¥4 served as baseline algorithms.

The purpose of our study was to analyse the cancer stage distribution data of Georgia as a first step towards identifying the areas of early cancer detection in the country that might need improvement or require further research.  Methods:   Descriptive analysis of the population-based cancer registry of Georgia was performed using the data for the period of 01.01.2018-31.12.2019.  Results:   Around 57 % of cancers in males and 56 % of cancers in females were amenable to early detection. At least 35.7 % of these cancers in males and 44.2 % in females were detected early. 15.2 % (n = 964) of male and 35.3 % (n = 3179) of female cancer patients met the age criteria for the respective cancer screening programmes. Breast, colorectal, cervical and stomach cancers contributed to 58.7 % of all late-stage cancers in females. Lung, prostate, colorectal, laryngeal and stomach cancers made up 72.4 % of all late-stage cancer cases among males. At least 83.8 % (n = 1438) of thyroid cancers in females and 84.2 % (n = 246) of thyroid cancers in males were diagnosed at stage I. Moreover, stage I thyroid cancer cases made up 50.7 % of all stage I cancer cases detected in women and 25.6 % of all stage I cancers in men. At least 42.4 % of stage I thyroid cancers in females and 37.4 % of stage I thyroid cancers in males were papillary microcarcinomas.

The impact of PCa natural history and therapeutic management on the outcomes of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with metastasis (mCRPC) remains unclear.  Objective:   The objective of this study was to describe retrospectively patterns of clinical progression through diagnosis sequences before the mCRPC stage and to assess how these sequences impacted patients' disease progression and overall survival at mCRPC stage.  Patients and methods:   Patients with mCRPC were identified from the Prostate Cancer Registry (PCR), an observational study in a real-world setting in 16 countries between 2013 and 2016. Patients were grouped in diagnosis sequences before mCRPC and defined by date of PCa diagnosis, first metastasis, and castration resistance. Distribution of time-to-event variables were estimated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit survival curves for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Non-adjusted Cox models were conducted for efficacy endpoints (OS, PFS) to estimate hazard ratios between diagnosis sequences.  Results:   At the end of study, 2859 mCRPC patients were included in this analysis. Among mCRPC four diagnosis sequences were identified: 35% developed metastases (mHSPC) before becoming castration resistant (sequence 1, metachronous mHSPC), 10% developed castration resistance (nmCRPC) before metastases (sequence 2), 27% developed metastases and castration resistance within 4 months (sequence 3) and 28% of patients were de novo mHSPC (sequence 4). Median OS was 17.7 months (interquartile range (IQR): 8.8-29.9) and PFS was 6.4 months (IQR: 3.2-12.0). The univariate analyses showed no correlation between mCRPC patients' OS or PFS and the diagnosis sequence.  Conclusion:   This large European study describe four different patterns of prostate cancer progression to mCRPC stage. Our results indicate that patient survival becomes comparable after progression to mCRPC, regardless of the diagnosis sequence.

Thus, one major issue in PCa research is to accurately distinguish between indolent and clinically significant (csPCa) to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment. In this study, we aim to validate the usefulness of diagnostic nomograms (DN) to detect csPCa, based on previously published urinary biomarkers.  Methods:   Capillary electrophoresis/mass spectrometry was employed to validate a previously published biomarker model based on 19 urinary peptides specific for csPCa. Added value of the 19-biomarker (BM) model was assessed in diagnostic nomograms including prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density and the risk calculator from the European Randomized Study of Screening. For this purpose, urine samples from 147 PCa patients were collected prior to prostate biopsy and before performing digital rectal examination (DRE). The 19-BM score was estimated via a support vector machine-based software based on the pre-defined cutoff criterion of - 0.07. DNs were subsequently developed to assess added value of integrative diagnostics.  Results:   Independent validation of the 19-BM resulted in an 87% sensitivity and 65% specificity, with an AUC of 0.81, outperforming PSA (AUC PSA: 0.64), PSA density (AUC PSAD: 0.64) and ERSPC-3/4 risk calculator (0.67). Integration of 19-BM with the rest clinical variables into distinct DN, resulted in improved (AUC range: 0.82-0.88) but not significantly better performances over 19-BM alone.  Conclusion:   19-BM alone or upon integration with clinical variables into DN, might be useful for detecting csPCa by decreasing the number of biopsies.""","""['Maria Frantzi', 'Isabel Heidegger', 'Marie C Roesch', 'Enrique Gomez-Gomez', 'Eberhard Steiner', 'Antonia Vlahou', 'William Mullen', 'Ipek Guler', 'Axel S Merseburger', 'Harald Mischak', 'Zoran Culig']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['How to make clinical decisions to avoid unnecessary prostate screening in biopsy-naÃ¯ve men with PI-RADs v2 score\u2009â¤\u20093?', 'Enhancement of prostate cancer diagnosis by machine learning techniques: an algorithm development and validation study.', 'The added value of percentage of free to total prostate-specific antigen, PCA3, and a kallikrein panel to the ERSPC risk calculator for prostate cancer in prescreened men.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Screening for prostate cancer.', 'Mass Spectrometry-Based Biomarkers to Detect Prostate Cancer: A Multicentric Study Based on Non-Invasive Urine Collection without Prior Digital Rectal Examination.']"""

The disease accounts for more than 22% of all tumors in the male population. Screening studies show an increase in the diagnosis of CaP without improvement in overall or CaP-specific mortality. The main goal of the work is to evaluate the incidence of CaP in the group of patients examined and treated during the period from 2014 to 2019 at the urological outpatient clinic of the Railway Hospital (RH) in KoÅ¡ice, and to evaluate the risks and treatment options.  Methods:   Men aged 40 to 75 years underwent a preventive examination in 2014-2019 at the urology outpatient clinic, RH KoÅ¡ice. The number of screened patients was 3,943. Epidemiological parameter, diagnosis-related examinations (prostate specific antigen - PSA examination, digital rectal examination, and ultrasonography examination) as well as the frequency of examinations were monitored during the specified period on the basis of documentation. The number of prostate biopsies, incidence of prostate cancer and relation to PSA values were also monitored, as well as the classification of prostate cancers according to the degree of risk. Initial treatment in individual patients was also evaluated.  Results:   PSA values in patients who underwent biopsy ranged from 3.6 ng/mL to 2,000 ng/mL. We observed positive digital rectal examination in 52 patients. Of the number of patients examined, 231 (61.28%) were positive biopsies. There were negative biopsies with the finding of benign prostatic hyperplasia in 92 patients or chronic prostatitis in 54 patients, i.e., 146 (38.72%). According to the criteria for risk assessment based on the PSA value and the result of the histological examination, we diagnosed 109 low-risk patients, 57 medium-risk patients and 24 high-risk patients.  Conclusion:   CaP is detected by prevention about 10 years before it develops clinically. The main aim of preventive examinations should be to detect, in particular, high-risk forms of early-stage prostate cancer and to improve the quality of life of men. Due to the results of extensive studies, it is necessary to continue the active search for prostate cancer.

VCP-associated inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia, also termed VCP disease and multisystem proteinopathy (MSP 1), is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by monoallelic variants in the VCP gene on human chromosome 9. VCP has also been strongly involved in cancer, with over-activity of VCP found in several cancers such as prostate, pancreatic, endometrial, esophageal cancers and osteosarcoma. Since MSP1 is caused by gain of function variants in the VCP gene, we hypothesized our patients would show increased risk for developing malignancies. We describe cases of 3 rare malignancies and 4 common cancers from a retrospective dataset.  Results:   Upon surveying 106 families with confirmed VCP variants, we found a higher rate of rare tumors including malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma and thymoma. Some of these subjects developed cancer before displaying other classic VCP disease manifestations. We also present cases of common cancers; however, we did not find an increased rate compared to the general population. This could be related to the early mortality associated with this disease, since most patients die in their 50-60 s due to respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy which is earlier than the age at which most cancers appear.  Conclusion:   This is the first study that expands the phenotype of VCP disease to potentially include rare cancers and highlights the importance of further investigation of the role of VCP in cancer development. The results of this study in VCP disease patients suggest that patients may be at an increased risk for rare tumors. A larger study will determine if patients with VCP disease develop cancer at a higher rate than the general population. If that is the case, they should be followed up more frequently and screened for recurrence and metastasis of their cancer.""","""['Alyaa Shmara', 'Mari Perez-Rosendahl', 'Kady Murphy', 'Ashley Kwon', 'Charles Smith', 'Virginia Kimonis']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Orphanet J Rare Dis""","""['Novel Variants in the VCP Gene Causing Multisystem Proteinopathy 1.', 'Characteristics of VCP mutation-associated cardiomyopathy.', 'Genotype-phenotype studies of VCP-associated inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and/or frontotemporal dementia.', 'The Cure VCP Scientific Conference 2021: Molecular and clinical insights into neurodegeneration and myopathy linked to multisystem proteinopathy-1 (MSP-1).', ""Valosin-containing protein disease: inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of the bone and fronto-temporal dementia."", 'Novel Variants in the VCP Gene Causing Multisystem Proteinopathy 1.', 'Multisystem proteinopathies (MSPs) and MSP-like disorders: Clinical-pathological-molecular spectrum.']"""

Currently, it is difficult to culture castration-resistant luminal cells with AR and PSA expression.  Methods:   We formulated a custom-made medium and isolated primary cells from the prostate of adult wild-type (WT) and TRAMP mice. The cells were characterized by immunofluorescence staining, transcriptomic analysis, and qRT-PCR verification. Their self-renewal and differentiation potential in vitro and in vivo were examined. We treated the cells with androgen deprivation and enzalutamide and performed immunofluorescence staining and western blotting to analyze their expression of AR and PSA.  Results:   We isolated a novel type of castration-resistant intermediate prostate stem cells (CRIPSCs) from adult WT and TRAMP mice. The mouse CRIPSCs proliferated rapidly in two-dimensional (2D) culture dishes and can be cultured for more than six months. The mouse CRIPSCs expressed luminal markers (AR, PSA, and Dsg4), basal markers (CK5 and p63), Psca, and the intermediate cell marker (Ivl). Transcriptomic analysis showed that the mouse CRIPSCs had upregulated signaling pathways related to cancer development and drug resistance. In the long-term culture, TRAMP CRIPSCs had higher expression of the genes related to stem cells and cancers than WT mice. Both WT and TRAMP CRIPSCs formed organoids in Matrigel. WT CRIPSCs did not form prostate tissues when transplanted in vivo without urogenital sinus mesenchyme (UGM) cells. In contrast, TRAMP CRIPSCs formed prostate ducts in NOG mice without UGM cells and differentiated into luminal, basal, and neuroendocrine cells. Androgens regulated AR translocation between the nucleus and cytoplasm in the mouse CRIPSCs. Treatment of androgen deprivation (ADT) and enzalutamide reduced AR expression in WT and TRAMP CRIPSCs; however, this treatment promoted PSA expression in TRAMP, while not WT CRIPSCs, similar to the clinical observations of CRPC.  Conclusions:   Our study established a method for isolating and expanding mouse CRIPSCs in 2D culture dishes. Mouse CRIPSCs had markers of basal and luminal cells, including AR and PSA, and can differentiate into prostate organoids and tissues. TRAMP CRIPSCs had elevated PSA expression upon ADT and enzalutamide treatment.

Methods:   Major pelvic ganglia (MPG) were collected from adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 12) to isolate SCs. SCs received RT (0 or 8 Gy), were plated on coated coverslips and grown to confluence before the addition of neurons. Additional MPGs were irradiated (0 or 8 Gy) and digested to isolate pelvic neurons. Dissociated neurons were plated alone or atop SC-coated coverslips to create 6 experimental groups (n = 3/grp): (i) Control (CON) MPG, (ii) RT MPG, (iii) CON SC + CON MPG, (iv) CONSC + RT MPG, (v) RT SC + CON MPG, and (iv) RT SC + RT MPG. After 72 hours, coverslips were fixed and stained for beta-tubulin (neuron marker), S100 (SC marker), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nitrergic marker), tyrosine hydroxylase (sympathetic marker), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling.  Outcomes:   We measured neurite length, branching, specific neuron populations and apoptosis.  Results:   Ex vivo RT decreased MPG neuron length, increased apoptosis and decreased nitrergic neurons in monoculture. Compared to all other groups, CON SC + RT MPG cocultures demonstrated increased neurite outgrowth (P < .001). Neurite branching was decreased in the RT MPG + RT SC coculture, but unchanged in other cocultures. Groups containing RT MPG neurons exhibited increased apoptosis, but coculture with CON SC reduced the degree of RT-induced apoptosis (P < .01). The number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons was unchanged while nitrergic neurons were significantly lower in RT neurons and coculture with CON SCs was unable to prevent nitrergic loss.  Clinical translation:   These findings suggest that SCs may be an important target in prostate cancer patients with radiation-induced pelvic neuropathy to promote MPG neuron survival and neuronal repair after RT.  Strengths and limitations:   This is the first study to characterize the ex vivo ability of SCs to rescue pelvic nerve growth and survival. The study is limited by little supporting mechanistic molecular data and the need to confirm the ability of healthy SCs to promote pelvic neuron survival and repair following prostatic RT in vivo.  Conclusion:   Unirradiated SCs partially mitigated RT-induced MPG apoptosis but did not affect the loss of nitrergic neuron populations suggesting that SCs promote irradiated MPG neuron survival and facilitate intrinsic repair functions.

Objective:   To validate the diagnostic performance of IsoPSA for High-Grade CaP and Any CaP risk on biopsy in men age â¥ 50 with total PSA â¥ 4 ng/ml.  Design, setting, and participants:   Prospective, multicenter study of 888 men scheduled for prostate biopsy at 8 academic and community sites between August 2015 and August 2020.  Intervention:   IsoPSA test.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Receiver operating characteristic and likelihood ratio analysis used to validate diagnostic performance for previously established IsoPSA Index cutoffs for High-Grade CaP (Gleason Score â¥ 7) and Any CaP (Gleason Score â¥ 6), compare IsoPSA to total PSA and % free PSA, and evaluate subgroups (total PSA 4-10 ng/ml, total PSA > 10 ng/ml, biopsy naÃ¯ve, prior negative biopsy).  Results and limitations:   The disease prevalence was 35.6% (High-Grade CaP) and 58.9% (Any CaP). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.783 (High-Grade CaP) and 0.770 (Any CaP). IsoPSA outperformed total PSA and % free PSA on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, specificity, positive and negative predictive value at similar sensitivity. Using selected IsoPSA Index cutoffs, an estimated 46% (High-Grade CaP) and 42% (Any CaP) of biopsies could be avoided in low-risk patients. IsoPSA displayed statistically informative likelihood ratio-based predictive characteristics. IsoPSA maintained accuracy in clinically relevant subgroups.  Conclusions:   IsoPSA diagnostic performance and predictive value is validated for High-Grade CaP and Any CaP in men age â¥ 50 with total PSA â¥ 4 ng/ml undergoing diagnostic biopsy.

Methods and materials:   Analyses included 9,717 patients with breast (n=3,078), prostate (n=5,748) or lung (n=891) cancer from Radiogenomics and REQUITE Consortia cohorts. Patients underwent potentially curative radiation therapy and were assessed prospectively for toxicity. Germline genotyping involved genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays with nontyped SNPs imputed. PRS for each cancer were generated by summing literature-identified cancer susceptibility risk alleles: 352 breast, 136 prostate, and 24 lung. Weighted PRS were generated using log odds ratio (ORs) for cancer susceptibility. Standardized total average toxicity (STAT) scores at 2 and 5 years (breast, prostate) or 6 to 12 months (lung) quantified toxicity. Primary analysis tested late STAT, secondary analyses investigated acute STAT, and individual endpoints and SNPs using multivariable regression.  Results:   Increasing PRS did not increase risk of late toxicity in patients with breast (OR, 1.000; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.997-1.002), prostate (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-1.00; weighted PRS OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83-1.03), or lung (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-1.00; weighted PRS OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45-1.03) cancer.

Judicious use of antibiotics is required as antimicrobial resistance increases worldwide. We aimed to assess whether antibiotic prophylaxis can be omitted when performing transperineal prostate biopsies under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure.  Methods:   In this randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we aimed to enrol all patients with a suspicion of prostate cancer undergoing transperineal prostate biopsies at two hospitals in Norway and Germany. Patients with a high risk of infection or ongoing infection were excluded. Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive intramuscular (in Norway) or intravenous (in Germany) 1Â·5 g cefuroxime antibiotic prophylaxis or not. Follow-up assessments were done after 2 weeks and 2 months. The primary outcome was rate of sepsis or urinary tract infections requiring hospitalisation within 2 months. The secondary outcome was the rate of urinary tract infections not requiring hospitalisation. These outcomes were assessed in all eligible randomly allocated participants with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 4%. Biopsies were performed using an MRI-transrectal ultrasound fusion transperineal technique under local anaesthesia. Patients with a positive MRI underwent 2-4 biopsies per target; in addition, 8-12 systematic biopsies were performed in biopsy naive and MRI-negative patients. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04146142.  Findings:   Between Nov 11, 2019, and Feb 23, 2021, 792 patients were referred for biopsy, of whom 555 (70%) were randomly allocated to treatment groups. 277 (50%) patients received antibiotic prophylaxis and 276 (50%) did not; two (&lt;1%) patients were excluded after randomisation because of unknown allergy to study drug. Sepsis or urinary tract infections requiring hospitalisation occurred in no patients given antibiotic prophylaxis (0%, 95% CI 0 to 1Â·37) or not given antibiotic prophylaxis (0%, 0 to 1Â·37; difference 0% [95% CI -1Â·37 to 1Â·37]). Urinary tract infections not requiring hospitalisation occurred in one patient given antibiotic prophylaxis (0Â·36%, 95% CI 0Â·01 to 2Â·00) and three patients not given antibiotic prophylaxis (1Â·09%, 0Â·37 to 3Â·15; difference 0Â·73% [95% CI -1Â·08 to 2Â·81]). The number needed to treat with antibiotic prophylaxis to avoid one infection was 137.  Interpretation:   The non-inferiority margin of 4% was not exceeded, suggesting rates of infections were not higher in patients not receiving antibiotic prophylaxis before transperineal prostate biopsy than in those receiving it.

Furthermore, we aimed to assess the influence of previous biopsies on cancer detection.  Methods:   In this retrospective single-centre study, we evaluated 524 cases of combined biopsy of the prostate from October 2015 to December 2018. All men had a clinical suspicion for prostate cancer due to an elevated PSA and/or a suspicious digital rectal examination and underwent a multiparametric MRI of the prostate read by one out of 6 experienced radiologists. In all cases, fusion-guided biopsy of the prostate was consecutively followed by systematic 12-core biopsy in the same session at the same urological department performed by one out of 5 experienced urologists.  Results:   In 270/524 (51.5%) cases, cancer was found using combined biopsy. Systematic biopsy alone detected cancer in 205/524 (39.1%) and clinically significant cancer in 137/524 (26.1%) cases. Fusion-guided biopsy alone detected 227/524 (43.3%) and clinically significant cancer in 150/524 (28.6%) cases. A histological upgrade of the Gleason score by fusion-guided biopsy was noted in 20/270 (7.4%) of all cancers found and by systematic biopsy in 31/270 (11.5%). Of all positive cases (clinically insignificant and significant cancer), 65/270 (24.1%) were detected only by fusion-guided biopsy, whereas 43/270 (15.9%) were detected only by systematic biopsy.

Of NOC patients, 1.6% harbored GGG â¥ 3, 6.3% harbored GGG2 and 2.6% harbored GGG1. Of pT2 patients, 4.4% harbored GGG â¥ 3, 33.9% harbored GGG2 and 51.3% harbored GGG1. Age, PSA, percentage of positive cores and number of positive cores independently predicted the presence of NOC and/or GGG â¥ 3, but with low accuracy (63.9%).  Conclusions:   In low-risk PCa, critical changes between tumor grade and stage at biopsy vs RP may be expected in very few patients: NOC with GGG â¥ 3 in 1.6% and NOC with GGG2 in 6.3%.

Materials and Methods In this prospective study, seven treatment-naive patients (age [mean Â± SD], 60 years Â± 11; five men) with GBM were imaged at 3 T by using a dual-tuned 13C-hydrogen 1 head coil. Hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate was injected, and signal was acquired by using a dynamic MRI spiral sequence. Metabolism was assessed within the tumor, in the normal-appearing brain parenchyma (NABP), and in healthy volunteers by using paired or unpaired t tests and a Wilcoxon signed rank test. The Spearman Ï correlation coefficient was used to correlate metabolite labeling with lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) expression and some immunohistochemical markers. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Results The bicarbonate-to-pyruvate (BP) ratio was lower in the tumor than in the contralateral NABP (P < .01). The tumor lactate-to-pyruvate (LP) ratio was not different from that in the NABP (P = .38). The LP and BP ratios in the NABP were higher than those observed previously in healthy volunteers (P < .05). Tumor lactate and bicarbonate signal intensities were strongly correlated with the pyruvate signal intensity (Ï = 0.92, P < .001, and Ï = 0.66, P < .001, respectively), and the LP ratio was weakly correlated with LDH-A expression in biopsy samples (Ï = 0.43, P = .04). Conclusion Hyperpolarized 13C MRI demonstrated variation in lactate labeling in GBM, both within and between tumors. In contrast, bicarbonate labeling was consistently lower in tumors than in the surrounding NABP.

Surgical and functional outcomes, and complications were compared. Oncological outcomes were also compared using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.  Results:   A higher biochemical recurrence rate were noted in RRP than in RPP group (28.8% vs 21.6%, respectively; p = 0.03). A local recurrence was detected in a few numbers of patients (4.4%) with no statistically significant differences by surgical groups (p = 0.71). No significant differences were observed in the cancer-specific survival and the overall survival according to the surgical approach. Positive surgical margins were similar in the two techniques.In comparison to RRP, patients undergoing RPP have less postoperative pain, decreased transfusion rate, and less catheterization time.

However, how the methylation of CpG islands at COX-2 regulates its expression in prostate cancer is still unclear. We will determine the methylated 5' CpG island of the COX-2 gene and its role in the expression of COX-2 in prostate androgen-dependent and androgen-independent cancer cells, LNCaP and DU145.  Methods:   We used western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to confirm the COX-2 expression in prostate cancer cell lines, including LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and DU145 (androgen-independent) cells. To investigate whether the COX-2 expression was regulated by the methylation status of the 5' CpG island, we treated LNCaP and DU145 cells with the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and determined COX-2 expression in the treated/untreated cells by western blotting and qRT-PCR. Subsequently, bisulfite sequencing was performed to study the methylation sites in the treated/untreated cells. The effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine to cell proliferation, cell migration and cell cycle process in DU145 and LNCaP cells were determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry, respectively.  Results:   The results revealed that the expression of COX-2 in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells was 5.44-fold (in protein level) and 2.46-fold (in mRNA level) higher than that in androgen-independent DU145 cells. After 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, COX-2 expression in DU145 cells was elevated significantly, but no change was found in LNCaP cells. The A and C regions of the COX-2 CpG island exhibited reduced methylation along with that an increased expression of COX-2 was noted in DU145 cell after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment. Also, the treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration and influenced the cell cycle progression in both DU145 and LNCaP cells.  Conclusions:   Our results reveal that androgen receptor (AR)-dependent/independent prostate cancer cell lines exhibit different regulation of methylation in COX-2 that regulate its expression. Additionally, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment of DU145 and LNCaP cells inhibits their ability of tumor progression.""","""['Chung-Yi Liu', 'Shih-Huan Su', 'Tzu-Hsuan Chang', 'Ming-Li Hsieh', 'Ying-Hsu Chang', 'Jacob See-Tong Pang', 'Cheng-Keng Chuang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Oncol""","""['CpG island promoter methylation and silencing of 14-3-3sigma gene expression in LNCaP and Tramp-C1 prostate cancer cell lines is associated with methyl-CpG-binding protein MBD2.', ""Demethylation of the miR-146a promoter by 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine correlates with delayed progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer."", 'Methylation of the androgen receptor promoter CpG island is associated with loss of androgen receptor expression in prostate cancer cells.', ""The Differential Antitumor Activity of 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine in Prostate Cancer DU145, 22RV1, and LNCaP Cells."", 'DNA methylation paradigm shift: 15-lipoxygenase-1 upregulation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer by atypical promoter hypermethylation.', 'Types of Cancer and Research Covered in World Journal of Oncology.', 'Therapeutic potential of targeting mirnas to prostate cancer tumors: using psma as an active target.']"""

In this study, we investigated whether docetaxel-based chemohormonal therapy induces immunologic changes and potentiates checkpoint blockade immunotherapy in prostate cancer. Methods: We performed transcriptome and histopathology analysis to characterize the changes of prostate cancer immune microenvironment before and after docetaxel-based chemohormonal therapy. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic benefits and underlying mechanisms of chemohormonal therapy combined with anti-PD1 blockade using cellular experiments and xenograft prostate cancer models. Finally, we performed a retrospective cohort analysis to evaluate the antitumor efficacy of anti-PD1 blockade alone or in combination with docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Results: Histopathology assessments on patient samples confirmed the enrichment of tumor-infiltrating T cells after chemohormonal therapy. Moreover, we found that docetaxel activated the cGAS/STING pathway in prostate cancer, subsequently induced IFN signaling, resulting in lymphocytes infiltration. In a xenograft mouse model, docetaxel-based chemohormonal therapy prompted the intratumoral infiltration of T cells and upregulated the abundance of PD1 and PD-L1, thereby sensitizing mouse tumors to the anti-PD1 blockade. To determine the clinical significance of these results, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 30 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients and found that docetaxel combined with anti-PD1 blockade resulted in better prostate-specific antigen progression-free survival when compared with anti-PD1 blockade alone. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that docetaxel activates the antitumoral immune response and facilitates T cell infiltration in a cGAS/STING-dependent manner, providing a combination immunotherapy strategy that would improve the clinical benefits of immunotherapy.""","""['Zehua Ma', 'Weiwei Zhang', 'Baijun Dong', 'Zhixiang Xin', 'Yiyi Ji', 'Ruopeng Su', 'Kai Shen', 'Jiahua Pan', 'Qi Wang', 'Wei Xue']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Effective combinatorial immunotherapy for castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'ATM/NEMO signaling modulates the expression of PD-L1 following docetaxel chemotherapy in prostate cancer.', 'DPP inhibition alters the CXCR3 axis and enhances NK and CD8+ T cell infiltration to improve anti-PD1 efficacy in murine models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Systemic treatments for metastatic cutaneous melanoma.', 'Activating cGAS-STING pathway for the optimal effect of cancer immunotherapy.', 'The anti-PD-1 era of cervical cancer: achievement, opportunity, and challenge.', 'Chemotherapeutic properties and side-effects associated with the clinical practice of terpene alkaloids: paclitaxel, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel.', 'The Role of cGAS-STING in Age-Related Diseases from Mechanisms to Therapies.', 'Immunotherapy: A new target for cancer cure (Review).', 'PD-1/L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy in the treatment of sarcomas.']"""

Previously, we observed that the combination of more variable telomere length among prostate cancer cells and shorter telomere length in prostate cancer-associated stromal cells - the telomere biomarker - is strongly associated with progression to metastasis and prostate cancer death after prostatectomy independent of currently used pathologic indicators. Here, we optimized our method allowing for semi-automated telomere length determination in single cells in fixed tissue, and tested the telomere biomarker in five cohort studies of men surgically treated for clinically localized disease (N = 2,255). We estimated the relative risk (RR) of progression to metastasis (N = 311) and prostate cancer death (N = 85) using models appropriate to each study's design adjusting for age, prostatectomy stage, and tumor grade, which then we meta-analyzed using inverse variance weights. Compared with men who had less variable telomere length among prostate cancer cells and longer telomere length in prostate cancer-associated stromal cells, men with the combination of more variable and shorter telomere length had 3.76 times the risk of prostate cancer death (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-10.3, p = 0.01) and had 2.23 times the risk of progression to metastasis (95% CI 0.99-5.02, p = 0.05).

Methods:   We screened HRD-related genes based on the HRD scores and constructed an HRD cluster system to explore different clinicopathological, genomic, and immunogenomic patterns among the clusters. A risk signature, HRDscore, was established and evaluated by multivariate Cox regression analysis. We noticed that SLC26A4, a model gene, demonstrated unique potential to predict prognosis and HRD in PCa. Multi-omics analysis was conducted to explore its role in PCa, and the results were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.  Results:   Three HRD clusters were identified with significant differences in patient prognosis, clinicopathological characteristics, biological pathways, immune infiltration characteristics, and regulation of immunomodulators. Further analyses revealed that the constructed HRDscore system was an independent prognostic factor of PCa patients with good stability. Finally, we identified a single gene, SLC26A4, which significantly correlated with prognosis in three independent cohorts. Importantly, SLC26A4 was confirmed to distinguish PCa (AUC for mRNA 0.845; AUC for immunohistochemistry score 0.769) and HRD (AUC for mRNA 0.911; AUC for immunohistochemistry score 0.689) at both RNA and protein levels in our cohort.

The costs of SSEs, AEs, and end-of-life care were $498,909 (â¬424,073), $276,198 (â¬234,768), and $808,785 (â¬687,468), respectively, for cabazitaxel and $627,569 (â¬533,434), $251,124 (â¬213,455), and $1,028,294 (â¬874,050), respectively, for a second ARTA. Cabazitaxel was estimated to be associated with a 21% reduction in both SSE management and end-of-life care costs. Hospitalization cost was $1,442,870 (â¬1,226,440) for cabazitaxel and $1,728,394 (â¬1,469,135) for a second ARTA, representing an estimated 17% reduction in these costs. Cabazitaxel, as compared with a second ARTA, was associated with 58 fewer hospitalization days and 2 fewer ICU days and was estimated to avoid $323,095 (â¬274,630, 17%) in total costs, driven by SSEs management and end-of-life care.  Conclusion:   The use of cabazitaxel as a 3 L treatment after docetaxel and an ARTA in patients with mCRPC is estimated to result in clinical benefits (longer rPFS, PFS, and OS) and lower healthcare resource utilization (fewer hospitalization and ICU days), compared with a second ARTA.""","""['Alicia K Morgans', 'Thomas Hutson', 'Alice Kai Dan Guan', 'David Garcia', 'Anna Zhou', 'Edward Drea', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with cabazitaxel versus abiraterone or enzalutamide in the CARD\xa0study.', 'Comparison of Sequential Treatment With Androgen Receptor-Targeted Agent Followed by\xa0Another Androgen Receptor-Targeted Agent Versus Androgen Receptor-Targeted Agent Followed by Docetaxel in Chemotherapy-Naive Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Real-world evidence of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with cabazitaxel: comparison with the randomized clinical study CARD.', 'Real-World Cabazitaxel Use and Outcomes in Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The Impact of Response to First ARPI.', 'Efficacy and safety of second-line agents for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer progressing after docetaxel.

Although few studies have revealed some angiogenesis-related genes (ARGs) could serve as prognosis-related biomarkers for the prostate cancer (PCa), the integrated role of ARGs has not been systematically studied. The RNA-sequencing data and clinical information of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) as discovery dataset. Twenty-three ARGs in total were identified to be correlated with prognosis of PRAD by the univariate Cox regression analysis, and a 19-ARG signature was further developed with significant correlation with the disease-free survival (DFS) of PRAD by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression with tenfold cross-validation. The signature stratified PRAD patients into high- and low-ARGs signature score groups, and those with high ARGs signature score were associated with significantly poorer outcomes (median DFS: 62.71 months vs unreached, p < 0.0001). The predicting ability of ARGs signature was subsequently validated in two independent cohorts of GSE40272 & PRAD_MSKCC. Notably, the 19-ARG signature outperformed the typical clinical features or each involved ARG in predicting the DFS of PRAD. Furthermore, a prognostic nomogram was constructed with three independent prognostic factors, including the ARGs signature, T stage and Gleason score. The predicted results from the nomogram (C-index = 0.799, 95%CI = 0.744-0.854) matched well with the observed outcomes, which was verified by the calibration curves. The values of area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for DFS at 1-, 3-, 5-year for the nomogram were 0.82, 0.83, and 0.83, respectively, indicating the performance of nomogram model is of reasonably high accuracy and robustness. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated the potential targets of E2F targets, G2M checkpoint pathways, and cell cycle pathways to suppress the PRAD progression. Of note, the high-risk PRAD patients were more sensitive to immune therapies, but Treg might hinder benefits from immunotherapies. Additionally, this established tool also could predict response to neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and some chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel, and docetaxel, etc. The novel ARGs signature, with prognostic significance, can further promote the application of targeted therapies in different stratifications of PCa patients.""","""['Cheng-Yuan Gu', 'Bo Dai', 'Yao Zhu', 'Guo-Wen Lin', 'Hong-Kai Wang', 'Ding-Wei Ye', 'Xiao-Jian Qin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Med""","""['Mitochondrial-Related Transcriptome Feature Correlates with Prognosis, Vascular Invasion, Tumor Microenvironment, and Treatment Response in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Identification of a novel senescence-associated signature to predict biochemical recurrence and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.', 'A N7-Methylguanine-Related Gene Signature Applicable for the Prognosis and Microenvironment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Roles of m5C RNA Modification Patterns in Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Microenvironment Characterization of Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Integrin Expression in Localized Prostate Cancer: A TCGA and MSKCC Cohort-based Exploratory In Silico Analysis.', 'Exploration of prognostic biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma microenvironment from TCGA database.', 'A combined signature of glycolysis and immune landscape predicts prognosis and therapeutic response in prostate cancer.']"""

However, it is not clear whether the OS for patients after progression on first-line ARAT differs if the first ARAT was administered in the mCSPC versus mCRPC setting and what its estimates are. We assessed the OS after disease progression on ARAT given as first-line therapy in mCSPC versus mCRPC. Patient-level data were collected retrospectively, and only those treated with first-line ARAT for mCSPC or mCRPC were included. For patients receiving ARAT in the mCRPC setting, no prior ARAT was allowed in the mCSPC setting. The median OS and hazard ratio (HR) were determined via Kaplan-Meier analysis from the time of progression on ARAT. Of 382 patients treated with first-line ARAT, 172 (44 mCSPC and 128 mCRPC) had experienced disease progression and were included in the analysis. Median OS was similar in the mCSPC (23 mo) and mCRPC (17 mo) settings (HR 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.62-1.56; p = 0.95). A total of 138 patients received subsequent systemic therapy after progression. Our results suggest that median OS is similar after progression on one ARAT, whether given in the first-line mCSPC or first-line mCRPC setting, and is estimated to be <2 yr. These data have implications for patient prognostication and the design of clinical trials in the post-ARAT setting for further drug development. PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated whether the survival benefit differs between metastatic castration-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer for patients who have already experienced cancer progression after first-line treatment with one drug targeting the androgen receptor pathway (called ARAT).

Since the last model update in 2017, technological advancements and the COVID-19 pandemic have led to increasing hypofractionation of radiotherapy schedules. Indications for radiotherapy have also evolved, particularly in the context of oligometastatic disease. Here we present a brief update on the model for 2021. We have updated the decision trees for breast, prostate, lung and head and neck cancers, and incorporated recent cancer incidence data into our model, generating a current estimate of fraction demand for these four cancer sites across England.  Materials and methods:   The decision tree update was based on evidence from practice-changing randomised controlled trials, published guidelines, audit data and expert opinion. Site- and stage-specific incidence data were taken from the National Disease Registration Service. We used the updated model to estimate the proportion of patients who would receive radiotherapy (appropriate rate of radiotherapy) and the fraction demand per million population at a national and Clinical Commissioning Group level in 2021.  Results:   The total predicted fraction demand has decreased by 11.4% across all four cancer sites in our new model, compared with the 2017 version. This reduction can be explained primarily by greater use of hypofractionated treatments (including stereotactic ablative radiotherapy) and a shift towards earlier stage presentation. The only large change in appropriate rate of radiotherapy was an absolute decrease of 3% for lung cancer.  Conclusions:   Compared with our previous model, the current version predicts a reduction in fraction demand across England. This is driven principally by hypofractionation of radiotherapy regimens, using technology that requires increasingly complex planning. Treatment complexity and local service factors need to be taken into account when translating fraction burden into linear accelerator demand or throughput.""","""['S Heritage', 'S Sundaram', 'N F Kirkby', 'K J Kirkby', 'T Mee', 'R Jena']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Oncol (R Coll Radiol)""","""['Variations in Demand across England for the Magnetic Resonance-Linac Technology, Simulated Utilising Local-level Demographic and Cancer Data in the Malthus Project.', 'Radiotherapy demand and activity in England 2006-2020.', 'Quantifying uncertainty in radiotherapy demand at the local and national level using the Malthus model.', 'Palliative radiotherapy regimens for patients with thoracic symptoms from non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A new index comparable to BED for evaluating the biological efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes on early stage non-small cell lung cancer: analysis of data from the literature.']"""

All patients completed self-reported validated questionnaires assessing pain, stress, self-efficacy, anxiety and study-specific questionnaires on expected and experienced pain before, during and after MR-TB. Patient characteristics and survey scores were obtained.  Results:   Overall, pain levels during MR-TB were low (mean 2.8/10 Â± 2.5 Numerical Rating Scale, NRS). 10/86 (11.6%) participants reported severe pain (â¥ 7/10 NRS). Pain correlated significantly with anxiety (r = 0.42), stress (r = 0.22) and pain expectancy (r = 0.58). High self-efficacy did not show increased pain resilience. Participants anticipated more pain than experienced during each step of MR-TB with significant differences concerning local anesthesia and core sampling (both p < 0.001), among others. Expectancy and actual pain did not match regarding severity and impact of the total amount of cores taken (p < 0.05). Independent predictors of increased pain at biopsy were prostate volume > 50 ml (p = 0.0179) and expected pain during rectal manipulation (p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Pain during MR-TB can be positively influenced by reducing men's anxiety, stress and pain expectancy. To meet the needs of the audience, clinicians should address concrete pain levels of each procedural step and consider special treatment for patients with prostate volume > 50 ml and men reporting on increased rectal sensitivity.""","""['Philipp Krausewitz', 'Helene Schmeller', 'Julian Luetkens', 'Darius Dabir', 'JÃ¶rg Ellinger', 'Manuel Ritter', 'Rupert Conrad']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""[""Prospective analysis of pain expectancy and experience during MR-fusion prostate biopsy: does reality match patients' expectancy?"", 'Pain in Men Undergoing Transperineal Free-Hand Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Fusion Targeted Biopsies under Local Anesthesia: Outcomes and Predictors from a Multicenter Study of 1,008 Patients.', 'Relationship Between Prebiopsy Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Biopsy Indication, and MRI-ultrasound Fusion-targeted Prostate Biopsy Outcomes.', 'Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy of the prostate: preliminary results of a prospective single-centre study.', 'Comparing Three Different Techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted Prostate Biopsies: A Systematic Review of In-bore versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging-transrectal Ultrasound fusion versus Cognitive Registration.

Experimental design:   Up to four cycles of radioligand therapy (RLT) were offered to patients with (i) progressive metastatic malignancy, (ii) exhaustion of approved therapies, and (iii) high fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression, defined as SUVmax â¥ 10 in more than 50% of tumor. Primary endpoint was RECIST response after RLT. Secondary endpoints included PET response (PERCIST), overall survival (OS), dosimetry, and safety of FAP-RLT.  Results:   Among 119 screened patients, 21 (18%) were found eligible [n = 16/3/1/1 sarcoma/pancreatic cancer/prostate/gastric cancer; 38% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) â¥ 2] and received 47 90Y-FAPI-46-RLT cycles; 16 of 21 (76%) patients underwent repeat RLT. By RECIST, disease control was confirmed in 8 of 21 patients [38%; 8/16 (50%) of evaluable patients). There was one partial response (PR) and seven stable diseases after RLT. Disease control was associated with prolonged OS (P = 0.013). PERCIST response was noted in 8 of 21 patients [38%; 8/15 (53%) of evaluable patients]. Dosimetry was acquired in 19 (90%) patients. Mean absorbed dose was 0.53 Gy/GBq in kidney, 0.04 Gy/GBq in bone marrow, and <0.14 Gy/GBq in liver and lung. Treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed in 8 (38%) patients with thrombocytopenia (n = 6) and anemia (n = 6) being most prevalent.  Conclusions:   90Y-FAPI-46-RLT was safe and led to RECIST PR in one case as well as stable disease in about one third of patients with initially progressive sarcomas, pancreatic cancer, and other cancers.

Patients, clinicians and policy-makers need reliable estimates of treatment effects within specific covariate subgroups, on relative and absolute scales, in order to target treatments appropriately-which estimation of an interaction effect does not in itself provide. Also, the focus has been on covariates with only two subgroups, and may exclude relevant data if only a single subgroup is reported. Therefore, in this article we further develop the ""within-trial"" framework by providing practical methods to (1) estimate within-trial interactions across two or more subgroups; (2) estimate subgroup-specific (""floating"") treatment effects that are compatible with the within-trial interactions and make maximum use of available data; and (3) clearly present this data using novel implementation of forest plots. We described the steps involved and apply the methods to two examples taken from previously published meta-analyses, and demonstrate a straightforward implementation in Stata based upon existing code for multivariate meta-analysis.

We compared a group of PCa survivors following ADT with ADT-naÃ¯ve patients, expecting the ADT group to show lower masculine self-esteem. We also expected patients with hegemonic masculinity ideals to show poorer masculine self-esteem and we hypothesized that ADT would moderate this relationship, expecting PCa patients on ADT with stronger hegemonic ideals to show the worst masculine self-esteem scores among study participants.  Methods:   We compared 57 PCa survivors on ADT (Mage = 64.16 (7.11)) to 59 ADT-naÃ¯ve patients (Mage = 65.25 (5.50)), on the Masculine Self-Esteem Scale (MSES), Body Image Scale (BIS), and Hegemonic Masculinity Ideals Scale (HMIS).  Results:   While the two groups did not significantly differ on masculine self-esteem (F [1, 115] = 3.46, p = 0.065, Î·p 2 = 0.029) and body image (F [1, 115] = 3.46, p = 0.065, Î·p 2 = 0.029), younger age was significantly associated with higher body image issues (F [1, 115] = 8.63, p < 0.01, Î·p 2 = 0.071, Î² = -0.30). Hegemonic masculinity significantly predicted more masculine self-esteem related issues (t (2, 114) = 2.31, Î² = 0.375, p < 0.05). ADT did not moderate this relationship.  Conclusions:   The results suggest that endorsing hegemonic masculinity could represent a risk factor for low masculine self-esteem regardless of ADT status and that younger age is associated with negative body image among PCa survivors.  Implications:   These results suggest the importance of inclusion of topics related to hegemonic masculinity when providing support to PCa survivors, both when discussing treatment side effects, as well as in the later phases of survivorship. This pilot also suggests that younger PCa survivors might benefit from body-image focused support regardless of treatment plan.""","""['Caterina Gentili', 'Stuart McClean', 'Lucy McGeagh', 'Amit Bahl', 'Raj Persad', 'Diana Harcourt']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Psychooncology""","""['Embodied masculinity and androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Perceptions of masculinity and body image in men with prostate cancer: the role of exercise.', 'Body image, self-esteem, and sense of masculinity in patients with prostate cancer: a qualitative meta-synthesis.', 'A systematic review of tools used to assess body image, masculinity and self-esteem in men with prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer From a Sex and Gender Perspective: A Review.']"""

Enzalutamide (ENZ) is an emerging second-generation androgen receptor (AR) antagonist used for the treatment of patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, due to the rapid onset of drug resistance, it provides only a modest increase in survival. Here, we propose a convenient and effective androgen receptor antagonist drug delivery strategy, that is, the use of a biocompatible nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery system for drug delivery to improve its bioavailability and therapeutic performance. Although the particle size of the phenylpropyl polymer (8P4) nanoparticles is small, it has a high drug-carrying capacity. ENZ-8P4 NPs can increase drug delivery efficiency, enhance drug cytotoxicity, and reduce the half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the drug. In addition, in vivo experiments confirmed that ENZ-8P4 preferentially accumulates in the tumor and significantly inhibits tumor growth. Hence, the 8P4 drug delivery system loaded with enzalutamide has excellent potential for the treatment of prostate cancer.""","""['Ze Gao', 'Jun Huang', 'Zhaoxiang Xie', 'Peikun Xin', 'Hao Huang', 'Tao Du', 'Jun Wu', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomater Sci""","""['Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9Â® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Intravenous delivery of enzalutamide based on high drug loading multifunctional graphene oxide nanoparticles for castration-resistant prostate cancer therapy.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

In this study, circRNA microarrays using four pairs of PCa tissues were utilized to show that circGFRA1 was upregulated in PCa tumor tissues. CircGFRA1 is suggested to play an oncogene role in PCa progression as the silencing of circGFRA1 inhibited the proliferation, migration, and immune escape activity of PCa cells. Furthermore, by utilizing bioinformatics analysis, RIP, RNA pull-down, and luciferase reporter assays, our results showed that LMX1B could bind to the GFRA1 promoter and regulate circGFRA1 expression in PCa cells and circGFRA1 upregulated HECTD1 expression through sponging miR-3064-5p.

The standard non-surgical approach for localized PCa is radiotherapy (RT), but one of the limitations of high-dose RT is the potential increase in gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities. We present the protocol of the Microstyle study, a multicentre randomized two-arm crossover clinical trial. The primary outcome will be assessed at the end of 6-month intervention, by measuring the change in adherence to a healthy lifestyle score. The hypothesis is that modifying lifestyle we change microbiome and improve quality of life and decrease side effects of RT.  Methods:   Study participants will be recruited among men undergoing RT in two Italian centers (Milan and Naples). We foresee to randomize 300 patients in two intervention arms: Intervention Group (IG) and Control Group (CG). Participants allocated to the IG will meet a dietitian and a physiotherapist before RT to receive personalized diet and exercise recommendations, according to their health status, to improve overall lifestyle and reduce side effects (bowel and/or urinary problems). Dietitian and physiotherapist will work together to set individualized goals to reduce or eliminate side effects and pain according to their health status. All participants (IG) will be given a pedometer device (steps counter) in order to monitor and to spur participants to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Participants included in the CG will receive baseline general advice and materials available for patients undergoing RT. According to the cross-over design, the CG will cross to the intervention approach after 6-month, to actively enhance compliance towards suggested lifestyle recommendations for all patients.  Discussion:   This trial is innovative in its design because we propose a lifestyle intervention during RT, that includes both dietary and physical activity counselling, as well as monitoring changes in microbiome and serum biomarkers. The promotion of healthy behaviour will be initiated before initiation of standard care, to achieve long lasting effects, controlling side effects, coping with feelings of anxiety and depression and improve efficacy of RT.

Recently, stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been reported to contribute to the progression of PCa. However, the role and mechanism of how PCa cells interact with stromal cells to reshape the TME remain largely unknown. Here, using a spontaneous prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) model driven by the loss of Pten and Hic1, we found that M2 macrophages markedly infiltrated the stroma of Pten and Hic1 double conditional knockout (dCKO) mice compared with those in control (Ctrl) mice due to higher TGF-Î² levels secreted by HIC1-deleted PCa cells. Mechanistically, TGF-Î² in TME promoted the polarization of macrophages into ""M2"" status by activating the STAT3 pathway and modulating c-Myc to upregulate CXCR4 expression. Meanwhile, TGF-Î² activated the fibroblasts to form cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that secrete higher CXCL12 levels, which bound to its cognate receptor CXCR4 on M2 macrophages. Upon interaction with CAFs, M2 macrophages secreted more CXCL5, which promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa via CXCR2. Moreover, using the TGF-Î² receptor I antagonist, galunisertib, significantly inhibited the tumor growth and progression of the TRAMP-C1 cell line-derived subcutaneous tumor model.

How cancer cells evade TGFÎ²-induced growth inhibition is unclear.  Methods:   We performed microarray analysis to search for genes regulated by APPL1/2 proteins in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. We investigated the role of TÎ²RI and TRAF6 in mitosis in cancer cell lines cultured in 10% FBS in the absence of exogenous TGFÎ². The molecular mechanism of the ubiquitination of AURKB by TRAF6 in mitosis and the formation of AURKB-TÎ²RI complex in cancer cell lines and tissue microarrays was also studied.  Findings:   During mitosis and cytokinesis, AURKB-TÎ²RI complexes formed in midbodies in CRPC and KELLY neuroblastoma cells. TRAF6 induced polyubiquitination of AURKB on K85 and K87, protruding on the surface of AURKB to facilitate its activation.

Methods:   A retrospective single centre analysis identified patients with an AAA plus cancer. Patients who had two or more computed tomography angiograms over six months or more and additional malignancy were included. Clinical data and aneurysm diameters were analysed. AAA growth under cancer therapy (chemotherapy or radiation) was compared with a non-cancer AAA control cohort and to meta-analysis data. Statistics included t tests and a linear regression model with correction for initial aortic diameter and type of treatment.  Results:   From 2003 to 2020, 217 patients (median age 70 years; 92% male) with 246 aneurysms (58.8% AAA) and 238 malignancies were identified. Prostate (26.7%) and lung (15.7%) cancer were most frequently seen. One hundred and fifty-seven patients (72.3%) received chemotherapy, 105 patients (48.4%) radiation, and 79 (36.4%) both. Annual AAA growth (mean Â± standard deviation) was not statistically significantly different for cancer and non-cancer patients (2.0 Â± 2.3 vs. 2.8 Â± 2.1 mm/year; p = .20). However, subgroup analyses revealed that radiation was associated with a statistically significantly reduced mean aneurysm growth rate compared with cancer patients without radiation (1.1 Â± 1.3 vs. 1.6 Â± 2.1 mm/year; p = .046) and to the non-cancer control cohort (1.7 Â± 1.9 vs. 2.8 Â± 2.1 mm/year; p = .007). Administration of antimetabolites resulted in statistically significantly increased AAA growth (+ 0.9 mm/year; p = .011), while topoisomerase inhibitors (- 0.8 mm/year; p = .17) and anti-androgens (- 0.5 mm/year; p = .27) showed a possible trend for reduced growth.

We report that LMWPTP favors the glycolytic profile in some tumors. Therefore, the focus of the present study was to identify metabolic enzymes that correlate with LMWPTP expression in patient samples. Exploratory data analysis from RNA-seq, proteomics, and histology staining, confirmed the higher expression of LMWPTP in CRC. Our descriptive statistical analyses indicate a positive expression correlation between LMWPTP and energy metabolism enzymes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty acid synthase (FASN). In addition, we examine the potential of violacein to reprogram energetic metabolism and LMWPTP activity. Violacein treatment induced a shift of glycolytic to oxidative metabolism associated with alteration in mitochondrial efficiency, as indicated by higher oxygen consumption rate. Particularly, violacein treated cells displayed higher proton leak and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR) as an indicator of the OXPHOS preference. Notably, violacein is able to bind and inhibit LMWPTP. Since the LMWPTP acts as a hub of signaling pathways that offer tumor cells invasive advantages, such as survival and the ability to migrate, our findings highlight an unexplored potential of violacein in circumventing the metabolic plasticity of tumor cells.""","""['Alessandra V S Faria', 'Emanuella M B Fonseca', 'PatrÃ­cia de S Fernandes-Oliveira', 'Tanes I de Lima', 'Stefano P Clerici', 'Giselle Z Justo', 'Leonardo R Silveira', 'Nelson DurÃ¡n', 'Carmen V Ferreira-Halder']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMWPTP) upregulation mediates malignant potential in colorectal cancer.', 'Low-Molecular-Weight Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Predicts Prostate Cancer Outcome by Increasing the Metastatic Potential.', 'Vemurafenib downmodulates aggressiveness mediators of colorectal cancer (CRC): Low Molecular Weight Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (LMWPTP), Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and Transforming Growth Factor Î² (TGFÎ²).', 'Low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase as signaling hub of cancer hallmarks.', 'From immune response to cancer: a spot on the low molecular weight protein tyrosine phosphatase.']"""

The purpose of this trial is to establish the non-inferiority of the new radiopharmaceutical in terms of the rate of PET-positive findings and to obtain an intra-individual comparison of accuracy and radiopharmaceutical kinetics.  Methods:   In this cross-over trial we will randomise 100 individuals to receive either first a standard-of-care PET/CT using [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 followed by an additional [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT within 2 weeks, or vice-versa. Inclusion criteria include patients 18 years and older with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy, defined as two consecutive prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels > 0.2 ng/ml.

We aimed to determine overall survival (OS) in patients experiencing sustained PSA increase, decrease, or fluctuations during therapy.  Materials and methods:   In this bicentric study, we included 176 mCRPC patients treated with PSMA-directed RLT. PSA levels were determined using blood samples prior to the first RLT and on the admission days for the following cycles. We calculated relative changes in PSA levels compared to baseline. Kaplan-Meier curves as well as log-rank test were used to compare OS of different subgroups, including patients with sustained PSA increase, decrease, or fluctuations (defined as change after initial decrease or increase after the first cycle).  Results:   Sixty-one out of one hundred seventy-six (34.7%) patients showed a sustained increase and 86/176 (48.8%) a sustained decrease in PSA levels. PSA fluctuations were observed in the remaining 29/176 (16.5%). In this subgroup, 22/29 experienced initial PSA decrease followed by an increase (7/29, initial increase followed by a decrease). Median OS of patients with sustained decrease in PSA levels was significantly longer when compared to patients with sustained increase of PSA levels (19 vs. 8 months; HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.56; P &lt; 0.001). Patients with PSA fluctuations showed a significantly longer median OS compared to patients with sustained increase of PSA levels (18 vs. 8 months; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.80; P &lt; 0.01), but no significant difference relative to men with sustained PSA decrease (18 vs. 19 months; HR 1.4, 95% CI 0.78-2.49; P = 0.20). In addition, in men experiencing PSA fluctuations, median OS did not differ significantly between patients with initial decrease or initial increase of tumor marker levels (16 vs. 18 months; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.38-4.05; P = 0.68).  Conclusion:   Initial increase or decrease of PSA levels is sustained in the majority of patients undergoing RLT. Sustained PSA decrease was linked to prolonged survival and men with PSA fluctuations under treatment experienced comparable survival benefits. As such, transient tumor marker oscillations under RLT should rather not lead to treatment discontinuation, especially in the absence of radiological progression.""","""['Philipp E Hartrampf#', 'Ralph A Bundschuh#', 'Franz-Xaver Weinzierl', 'Sebastian E Serfling', 'Aleksander Kosmala', 'Anna Katharina Seitz', 'Hubert KÃ¼bler', 'Andreas K Buck', 'Markus Essler', 'Rudolf A Werner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['177 Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Initial 254-patient results from a prospective registry (REALITY Study).', 'Any decline in prostate-specific antigen levels identifies survivors scheduled for prostate-specific membrane antigen-directed radioligand therapy.', 'A Single-Arm, Low-Dose, Prospective Study of 177Lu-EB-PSMA Radioligand Therapy in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 Î±-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Factors predicting biochemical response and survival benefits following radioligand therapy with 177LuLu-PSMA in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a review.', 'SUVmean on baseline 18FPSMA-1007 PET and clinical parameters are associated with survival in prostate cancer patients scheduled for 177LuLu-PSMA I&T.']"""

Population:   A total of 226 patients (mean age 66.6 Â± 9.02 years) with suspicion of PCa (PI-RADS score â¥ 3) and received combined cognitive MRTB with SB were retrospectively recruited and randomly divided into training (N = 180) and test (N = 46) cohorts at an 8:2 ratio.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3.0 T, biparametric MRI (bpMRI) including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map.  Assessment:   The whole prostate gland (PG) and the index lesion (IL) were delineated. Three radiomics models of bpMRIPG , bpMRIIL , and bpMRIPG+IL were constructed, respectively, and the performance of each radiomics model was compared with that of PI-RADS assessment.  Statistical tests:   The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression method was used to select texture features. The area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis were used to estimate the models.  Results:   The bpMRIPG+IL radiomics model exhibited good discrimination, calibration, and net benefits, which would reduce the SB biopsy in 71.2% and 71.4% of men with PI-RADS â¥ 5 lesions in the training and test cohorts, respectively.

Purpose To estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) of DCFPyL PET/CT by providing histopathologic proof for DCFPyL-avid lesions suspected of being distant metastases at initial diagnosis and recurrence in BCR prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this prospective trial, men with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer (sample 1) or BCR prostate cancer and negative findings at conventional CT and/or bone scanning (sample 2) were enrolled between January and December 2021. All men underwent DCFPyL PET/CT. Suspected distant metastases and/or recurrences were biopsied. PPV was calculated. Results A total of 92 men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (median age, 70 years; IQR, 64-75 years) (sample 1) and 92 men with BCR prostate cancer (median age, 71 years; IQR, 66-75 years) (sample 2) were enrolled.

Micro-US is being investigated for csPCa detection. Purpose To compare multiparametric MRI and micro-US in detecting csPCa (grade group â¥2) and to determine the proportion of MRI nodules visible at micro-US for real-time targeted biopsy. Materials and methods This prospective, single-center trial enrolled biopsy-naive men with suspected prostate cancer (PCa) between May 2019 and September 2020. All patients underwent multiparametric MRI followed by micro-US; findings at both were interpreted in a blinded fashion, followed by targeted biopsy and nontargeted systematic biopsy using micro-US. Proportions were compared using the exact McNemar test. The differences in proportions were calculated. Results Ninety-four men (median age, 61 years; IQR, 57-68 years) were included. MRI- and micro-US-targeted biopsy depicted csPCa in 37 (39%) and 33 (35%) of the 94 men, respectively (P = .22); clinically insignificant PCa in 14 (15%) and 15 (16%) (P > .99); and cribriform and/or intraductal PCa in 14 (15%) and 13 (14%) (P > .99). The MRI- plus micro-US-targeted biopsy pathway depicted csPCa in 38 of the 94 (40%) men. The addition of nontargeted systematic biopsy to MRI- plus micro-US-targeted biopsy did not enable identification of any additional men with csPCa but did help identify nine additional men with clinically insignificant PCa (P = .04). Biopsy was avoided in 32 of the 94 men (34%) with MRI and nine of the 94 men (10%) with micro-US (P < .001). Among 93 MRI targets, 62 (67%) were prospectively visible at micro-US. Conclusion MRI and micro-US showed similar rates of prostate cancer detection, but more biopsies were avoided with the MRI pathway than with micro-US, with no benefit of adding nontargeted systematic biopsy to the MRI- plus micro-US-targeted biopsy pathway.

Four different protocol outcomes and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses were evaluated. The median follow-up was 8.4 years. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the biochemical or clinical failure-free rate (BCFFR). Clinical RBE was calculated using the tumor control probability model.  Results:   The 5-, 7-, and 10-year BCFFRs were 91.7%, 83.8%, and 73.2%, respectively. The 10-year BCFFRs of patients who received C-ion RT at 66 Gy (RBE) in 20 fractions, 63 Gy (RBE) in 20 fractions, and 57.6 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions were 81.4%, 70.9%, and 68.9%, respectively. The PSA level and density during follow-up were better in the patients treated with the lower fraction size.

Methods:   A total of 192 men with APC were randomized to either a CBSM or a health promotion condition and followed for one year. Six analytical samples were included in our study, each including participants who reported elevated levels of burden for the corresponding outcome at baseline. Outcomes included five domains of symptom-related quality of life (urinary incontinence n = 98; urinary irritation n = 61; bowel function n = 43; sexual function n = 177; and hormonal function n = 149) and depression (n = 31).

For PCa lesion segmentation, it is essential to reliably combine local and global information to retain the features of small targets at multiple scales. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-scale segmentation network with a cascading pyramid convolution module (CPCM) and a double-input channel attention module (DCAM) for the automated and accurate segmentation of PCa lesions using mpMRI.  Methods:   First, the region of interest was extracted from the data by clipping to enlarge the target region and reduce the background noise interference. Next, four CPCMs with large convolution kernels in their skip connection paths were designed to improve the feature extraction capability of the network for small targets. At the same time, a convolution decomposition was applied to reduce the computational complexity. Finally, the DCAM was adopted in the decoder to provide bottom-up semantic discriminative guidance; it can use the semantic information of the network's deep features to guide the shallow output of features with a higher discriminant ability. A residual refinement module (RRM) was also designed to strengthen the recognition ability of each stage. The feature maps of the skip connection and the decoder all go through the RRM.  Results:   For the Initiative for Collaborative Computer Vision Benchmarking (I2CVB) dataset, our proposed model achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 79.31% and an average boundary distance (ABD) of 4.15 mm. For the Prostate Multiparametric MRI (PROMM) dataset, our method greatly improved the DSC to 82.11% and obtained an ABD of 3.64 mm.  Conclusions:   The experimental results of two different mpMRI prostate datasets demonstrate that our model is more accurate and reliable on small targets.

Data collected included the treating hospital, year of presentation, age and histological diagnosis. The commonly diagnosed malignant tumours in AYA were compared with tumours in older adults. A p-value below 0.05 was considered significant.  Results:   A total of 61 828 records were retrieved and 29 974 were excluded. Additionally, 1 055 post-excision results from AYA were excluded. Of the remaining 30 799 records, 13.1% (4 032/30 799) were diagnosed in AYA, of which 18.2% (734/4 032) were in-situ lesions. Overall, 11% (3 298/30 065) of invasive tumours were from the AYA. The majority, 81.1% (3 269/4 032), of invasive and non-invasive malignant tumours in AYA were from females.

Methods:   This randomized study enrolled 25 consecutive male patients with indication of nsRALP. The HD and the subsequent dissection of the seminal vesicles (SVs) and RPS was performed by a resident in learning curve for RALP; the residual portion of RALP was performed by an expert. The perioperative, oncologic and functional outcomes of 2 groups of patients (Group A: nsRALP after HD of the RPS and Group B: standard nsRALP without HD) were compared. Two analyses were performed, considering a per-protocol (PP) population regarding only randomized patients with correct HD and an Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population regarding all randomized patients.  Results:   In 4/14 (29%) of patients of Group A the injected fluid was not intraoperatively identified in the expected plane. The groups were statistically homogeneous in relation to the baseline variables. A statistically significant difference was observed between the SVs/RPS dissection time and the SVs-related estimated blood loss in both analyses. A significantly higher rate of dry patients was observed in group A at 1 month after nsRALP. A statistically significant correlation was observed between the effective time of dissection of the SVs and the postoperative IIEF-5 drop.  Conclusions:   The transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal HD seems useful for the preliminary development of the RPS during the learning curve period of nsRALP. It seems associated with less time and blood loss for the dissection of the SVs and RPS.

In a prior single-center study, we found that this might not be the case for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Objective:   To investigate the relationship between prior experience of a surgeon and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively analyzed the data of 8101 patients with prostate cancer treated with RARP by 46 surgeons at nine institutions between 2003 and 2021. Surgical experience was coded as the total number of robotic prostatectomies performed by the surgeon before the patient operation.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated the relationship of prior surgeon experience with the probability of BCR adjusting for preoperative prostate-specific antigen, pathologic stage, grade, lymph-node involvement, and year of surgery.  Results and limitations:   Overall, 1047 patients had BCR. The median follow-up for patients without BCR was 33 mo (interquartile range: 14, 61). After adjusting for case mix, the relationship between surgical experience and the risk of BCR after surgery was not statistically significant (p = 0.2). The 5-yr BCR-free survival rates for a patient treated by a surgeon with prior 10, 250, and 1000 procedures performed were, respectively, 82.0%, 82.7%, and 84.8% (absolute difference between 10 and 1000 prior procedures: 1.6% [95% confidence interval: 0.4%, 3.3%). Results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses.  Conclusions:   These findings suggest that, as opposed to open and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, surgeons performing RARP achieve adequate cancer control in the early phase of their career. Further research should explore why the learning curve for robotic surgery differs from prior findings for open and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. We hypothesize that surgical education, including simulation training and the adoption of objective performance metrics, is an important mechanism for flattening the learning curve.  Patient summary:   We investigated the relationship between biochemical recurrence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and surgeon's experience.

Timely screening, management, and documentation of these toxicities is an integral part of clinician practice, ensuring patients receive the care they require. Various screening tools, completed by either the patient or the clinician, are available, which allow clinicians to collect and respond to these toxicity outcomes; however there is a paucity of literature regarding the effective use and timing of these tools during RT treatment. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of conducting comprehensive toxicity screening and symptom management using a toxicity screening tool in one of the busiest RT departments in Canada. Specifically, the use of a toxicity screening tool and its effect on the quality of toxicity documentation, operational impact, and patient reported outcomes (PRO).  Methods:   90 consented patients were allocated to either the structured or non-structured arm. Patients in the structured arm were assessed weekly by radiation therapists for 13 toxicities across four domains (bladder, bowel, hormonal, and sexual), using an in-house developed structured questionnaire, known as the Grid, to complete the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v3 (CTCAEv3). Patients in the non-structured arm were assessed and had free text clinical documentation charted according to current department policy. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC), a PRO tool to evaluate patient function and bother after prostate cancer treatment, was completed by all study patients on a weekly basis. Statistical analysis compared documentation completeness, EPIC scores, patient satisfaction, and operational impact between study arms, as well as evaluated optimal timing of toxicity assessments.  Results:   Assessment of the non-structured arm for completeness revealed an inconsistent and insufficient amount of documentation for the bladder and bowel domains. As for both the sexual and hormonal domains, documentation was largely absent. There was no difference in EPIC scores and patient satisfaction scores between the structured arm and the non-structured arm. Evaluation of the timing of PROs showed significant week to week change for the bladder and bowel toxicities, but not the sexual and hormonal toxicities. Finally, the use of the Grid revealed no significant impact on daily operations, only increasing average treatment times by seven seconds, and did not create any additional workload for the oncologists.  Conclusions:   Use of the Grid increased documentation completeness without negatively impacting clinical flow or operations, despite the fact that PROs were not improved. Based on EPIC PRO scores, bladder and bowel toxicities should be evaluated on a weekly basis during RT treatment, while sexual and hormonal toxicities need only be evaluated monthly.""","""['Edward Leung', 'Heather Fineberg', 'Tessa Larsen', 'Mina Yaver', 'Ann Foo', 'Julia Ma', 'Judith Versloot', 'Simona C Minotti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Med Imaging Radiat Sci""","""['Piloting prostate cancer patient-reported outcomesin clinical practice.', 'Expanded validation of the EPIC bowel and urinary domains for use in women with gynecologic cancer undergoing postoperative radiotherapy.', 'Urodynamics tests for the diagnosis and management of bladder outlet obstruction in men: the UPSTREAM non-inferiority RCT.', 'Quality of life study in prostate cancer patients treated with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy: comparing late bowel and bladder quality of life symptoms to that of the normal population.', 'A systematic review of expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC) quality of life after surgery or radiation treatment.']"""

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reportedly involved in the progression of various cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). This study was designed to establish a ferroptosis-related lncRNA (frlncRNA) signature to predict PCa prognosis.  Methods:   The frlncRNAs were identified by studying their expression by Pearson's correlation analysis. Differentially expressed prognosis related frlncRNAs were identified by the Wilcoxon test and univariate Cox regression analysis. The LASSO Cox regression model was used to build a model to predict biochemical recurrence (BCR) based on frlncRNAs. The GSEA software (version 4.1.0) was used to explore the enriched pathways in high- and low- risk groups. Patients with PCa were clustered into different subgroups by unsupervised clustering based on the frlncRNAs considered in the prognostic model. Real-time PCR and CCK8 assays were performed to verify the expression and function of frlncRNAs.  Results:   We identified 35 differentially expressed prognosis related frlncRNAs based on data on PCa from TCGA. A risk signature based on five frlncRNAs (AP006284.1, AC132938.1, BCRP3, AL360181.4 and AL135999.1), was confirmed to perform well in predicting BCR. The high-risk group had higher disease grades and a greater number of infiltrating immune cells. Besides this, we found that the five frlncRNAs were connected with typical immune checkpoints. With respect to molecular mechanisms, several metabolic pathways were found to enriched in the low-risk group. Furthermore, patients could be classified into different subtypes with different PSA-free times using the five frlncRNAs. Notably, AP006284.1, AC132938.1, BCRP3 and AL135999.1 were upregulated in PCa cells and tissues, whereas AL360181.4 exhibited the opposite trend.

The present study analyzes Italian (Milan) and Dutch (Rotterdam) men prospectively included in the Prostate cancer International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) trial, aiming to explore whether socio-demographic factors (i.e. age, relationship status, education, nationality) may be relevant factors in conditioning the level of anxiety at AS entry and over time.  Methods:   Italian and Dutch men participating in the IRB-approved PRIAS study, after signing an informed consent, filled in the Memorial Anxiety Scale for PCa (MAX-PC) at multiple time points after diagnosis. A linear mixed model was used to assess the relationship between the level of patient's anxiety and time spent on AS, country of origin, the interaction between country and time on AS, patients' relationship status and education, on PCa anxiety during AS.  Results:   823 MAX-PC questionnaires were available for Italian and 307 for Dutch men, respectively. Median age at diagnosis was 64 years (IQR 60-70 years) and did not differ between countries. On average, Dutch men had a higher total MAX-PC score than Italian men. However, the level of their anxiety decreased over time. Dutch men on average had a higher score on the PCa anxiety sub-domain, which did not decrease over time. Minimal differences were observed in the sub-domains PSA anxiety and fear of recurrence.  Conclusion:   Significant differences in PCa anxiety between the Italian and Dutch cohorts were observed, the latter group of men showing higher overall levels of anxiety. These differences were not related to the socio-demographic factors we studied. Although both PRIAS-centers are dedicated AS-centers, differences in PCa-care organization (e.g. having a multidisciplinary team) may have contributed to the observed different level of anxiety at the start and during AS.

Methods and materials:   Data from 111 patients with 114 metastases in the femur, humerus, and tibia treated with SBRT in 7 international centers between October 2011 and February 2021 were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed using a competing risk regression model.  Results:   The median follow-up was 21 months (range, 6-91 months). All but 1 patient had a Karnofsky performance status â¥70. There were 84 femur (73.7%), 26 humerus (22.8%), and 4 tibia (3.5%) metastases from prostate (45 [39.5%]), breast (22 [19.3%]), lung (15 [13.2%]), kidney (13 [11.4%]), and other (19 [16.6%]) malignancies. Oligometastases accounted for 74.8% of metastases and 28.1% were osteolytic. The most common total doses were 30 to 50 Gy in 5 daily fractions (50.9%). Eight fractures (5 in the femur, 2 in the tibia, and 1 in the humerus) were observed with a median time to fracture of 12 months (range, 0.8-33 months). In 6 out of 8 patients, fracture was not associated with local failure. The cumulative incidence of fracture was 3.5%, 6.1%, and 9.8% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. The cumulative incidence of local failure (9/110 metastases with imaging follow-up) was 5.7%, 7.2%, and 13.5% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. On multivariate analysis, extraosseous disease extension was significantly associated with fracture (P = .001; subhazard ratio, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 2.8-41.9) and local failure (P = .02; subhazard ratio, 7.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-44.7).

Most deaths are caused by metastasis, and tumor cell dissemination involves the interaction with endothelial cells. However, the endothelial cell signaling involved in such interaction is not entirely understood. The tumor microenvironment contains extracellular ATP, an endogenous agonist of the purinergic P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R). P2Y2R signaling changes endothelial cell phenotype, which may be relevant to cancer pathophysiology. Therefore, we hypothesized that P2Y2R activation could favor the metastatic prostate cancer cells adhesion to endothelial cells.  Main methods:   For adhesion assays, confluent endothelial cells EA.hy926 were treated with P2Y2R agonists before adding and imaging stained DU-145 cells. Alternatively, fluorescent probes and antibodies were used to determine intracellular endothelial Ca2+, nitric oxide (NO), and flow cytometry assays.  Key findings:   Endothelial P2Y2R activation with ATP, UTP, or the selective agonist 2-thio-UTP increased DU-145 cell adhesion to EA.hy926 cells. This effect required endothelial cell Ca2+ mobilization and relied on the endothelial expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Conversely, inhibiting this proadhesive endothelial phenotype could impair DU-145 cell adhesion. To evaluate this, we chose atorvastatin based on its notable improvement of endothelial cell dysfunction. Atorvastatin blocked UTP-induced DU-145 cell adhesion to endothelial cell monolayer in a NO-dependent manner, unveiling a P2Y2R and NO signaling crosstalk.  Significance:   Endothelial P2Y2R signaling contributes to the adhesion of metastatic prostate cancer cells suggesting that the downstream signaling blockade by statins could be a putative mechanism to reduce prostate cancer metastasis.""","""['Tassya Cataldi Cardoso', 'Marianna Araujo Rocha', 'Matheus M L V Monteiro', 'VinÃ­cius Santos Alves', 'Luiz Eduardo Baggio Savio', 'Claudia Lucia Martins Silva']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['P2Y2 receptor activation by nucleotides released from highly metastatic breast cancer cells increases tumor growth and invasion via crosstalk with endothelial cells.', 'P2Y(2)R activation by nucleotides released from oxLDL-treated endothelial cells (ECs) mediates the interaction between ECs and immune cells through RAGE expression and reactive oxygen species production.', 'P2Y2 receptor activation promotes esophageal cancer cells proliferation via ERK1/2 pathway.', 'Nucleotide receptors and actin cytoskeleton dynamics.', 'Therapeutic potential for P2Y2 receptor antagonism.']"""

By phosphorylation and conjugating nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) to hydroxybiphenylcarboxylate (BP), we obtained pBP-NBD (1P) as a substrate of both acid and alkaline phosphatases. 1P effectively kills both metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer cells (mCRPCs) and osteoblast mimic cells in their coculture. 1P enters Saos2 almost instantly to target the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the cells. Co-culturing with Saos2 cells boosts the cellular uptake of 1P by mCRPCs. Cryo-EM reveals the nanotube structures of both 1P (2.4 Ã resolution, pH 5.6) and 1 (2.2 Ã resolution, pH 7.4).

However, it is unclear when and how HOXB13 primes CRPCs for AR antagonism. By mass-spectrometry analysis of CRPC extract, we uncovered a novel lysine 13 (K13) acetylation in HOXB13 mediated by CBP/p300. To determine whether acetylated K13-HOXB13 is a clinical biomarker of CRPC development, we characterized its role in prostate cancer biology.  Experimental design:   We identified tumor-specific acK13-HOXB13 signal enriched super enhancer (SE)-regulated targets. We analyzed the effect of loss of HOXB13K13-acetylation on chromatin binding, SE proximal target gene expression, self-renewal, enzalutamide sensitivity, and CRPC tumor growth by employing isogenic parental and HOXB13K13A mutants. Finally, using primary human prostate organoids, we evaluated whether inhibiting an acK13-HOXB13 target, ACK1, with a selective inhibitor (R)-9b is superior to AR antagonists in inhibiting CRPC growth.  Results:   acK13-HOXB13 promotes increased expression of lineage (AR, HOXB13), prostate cancer diagnostic (FOLH1), CRPC-promoting (ACK1), and angiogenesis (VEGFA, Angiopoietins) genes early in prostate cancer development by establishing tumor-specific SEs. acK13-HOXB13 recruitment to key SE-regulated targets is insensitive to enzalutamide. ACK1 expression is significantly reduced in the loss of function HOXB13K13A mutant CRPCs. Consequently, HOXB13K13A mutants display reduced self-renewal, increased sensitivity to enzalutamide, and impaired xenograft tumor growth. Primary human prostate tumor organoids expressing HOXB13 are significantly resistant to AR antagonists but sensitive to (R)-9b.  Conclusions:   In summary, acetylated HOXB13 is a biomarker of clinically significant prostate cancer. Importantly, PSMA-targeting agents and (R)-9b could be new therapeutic modalities to target HOXB13-ACK1 axis regulated prostate cancers.""","""['Duy T Nguyen#', 'Wei Yang#', 'Arun Renganathan', 'Cody Weimholt', 'Duminduni H Angappulige', 'Thanh Nguyen', 'Robert W Sprung', 'Gerald L Andriole', 'Eric H Kim', 'Nupam P Mahajan', 'Kiran Mahajan#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Loss of Long Noncoding RNA NXTAR in Prostate Cancer Augments Androgen Receptor Expression and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Diverse AR-V7 cistromes in castration-resistant prostate cancer are governed by HoxB13.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of drug resistance that target the androgen axis in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).', 'Super-enhancers complexes zoom in transcription in cancer.']"""

Here, we report that AR-V7 has unique biological features that functionally differentiate it from canonical AR-fl or from the second most prevalent variant, AR-v567. First, AR-V7 exhibits fast nuclear import kinetics via a pathway distinct from the nuclear localization signal dependent importin-Î±/Î² pathway used by AR-fl and AR-v567. We also show that the dimerization box domain, known to mediate AR dimerization and transactivation, is required for AR-V7 nuclear import but not for AR-fl. Once in the nucleus, AR-V7 is transcriptionally active, yet exhibits unusually high intranuclear mobility and transient chromatin interactions, unlike the stable chromatin association of liganded AR-fl. The high intranuclear mobility of AR-V7 together with its high transcriptional output, suggest a Hit-and-Run mode of transcription.

Materials and methods:   QoL data were collected with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Advanced Prostate Symptom Index - 8 Item version (FAPSI-8). Pain was measured using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A total of 743 forms from 163 patients were analysed in Arm A (2-weekly docetaxel), and 704 forms from 173 patients were analysed in Arm B (3-weekly docetaxel). The data were analysed using both the Wilcoxon signed rank test (with Holm-Bonferroni adjustment) and Mann-Whitney U models.  Results:   No major differences were found in total QoL. Total QoL was higher at month 8 in Arm B (p = .020), but this was reversed in the following month (p = .043), and no statistically significant differences were found during other months. Compared to Arm A, participants in Arm B had longer-lasting deterioration in FAPSI-8 scores and emotional well-being subdomain at the beginning of treatment (p < .05). Various one-month differences were found in FACT-P subdomains (except for functional well-being), and these favoured participants in Arm A, except for the prostate-cancer subdomain. There were no differences in pain.

Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), is a gram-negative oral keystone pathogen that may cause severe periodontitis and expresses several virulence factors to affect the host immune system. Periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease that while progression, may cause loss of attachment and destruction of the tooth supporting tissues. Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies in men. Increasing evidence links periodontitis with prostate cancer, however the mechanisms explaining this relationship remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and signaling pathway of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in a prostate cancer cell line after infection with P. gingivalis and stimulation with P. gingivalis components to reveal the mechanism of tumor-induced immune evasion associated with bacterial infection in the tumor environment. Prostate cancer cells were infected with different concentrations of viable P. gingivalis and treated with different concentrations of heat-killed P. gingivalis and P. gingivalis cell components, including the total membrane fraction, inner membrane fraction, outer membrane fraction, cytosolic fraction and peptidoglycan (PGN). Chemical inhibitors were used to block different important molecules of signaling pathways to assess the participating signal transduction mechanisms. PD-L1 expression was detected by Western blot after 24 h of infection. PD-L1 was demonstrated to be upregulated in prostate cancer cells after infection with viable and with heat-killed P. gingivalis membrane fractions. Also isolated PGN induced PD-L1 up-regulation. The upregulation was mediated by the NOD1/NOD2 signaling pathway. No upregulation could be detected after treatment of the cells with P. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (LPS). These results indicate, that chronic inflammatory disease can contribute to tumor immune evasion by modifying the tumor microenvironment. Thus, chronic infection possibly plays an essential role in the immune response and may promote the development and progression of prostate cancer.""","""['Sabine Groeger', 'Fan Wu', 'Florian Wagenlehner', 'Temuujin Dansranjav', 'Sabine Ruf', 'Fabian Denter', 'Joerg Meyle']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Cell Infect Microbiol""","""['Induction of B7-H1 receptor by bacterial cells fractions of Porphyromonas gingivalis on human oral epithelial cells: B7-H1 induction by Porphyromonas gingivalis fractions.', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis induced up-regulation of PD-L1 in colon carcinoma cells.', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis Cell Wall Components Induce Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Expression on Human Oral Carcinoma Cells by a Receptor-Interacting Protein Kinase 2 (RIP2)-Dependent Mechanism.', 'PD-1/PD-L1 pathway: A double-edged sword in periodontitis.', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis survival skills: Immune evasion.', 'FAM72 family proteins as poor prognostic markers in clear cell renal carcinoma.', 'Virulence Factors of the Periodontal Pathogens: Tools to Evade the Host Immune Response and Promote Carcinogenesis.', 'NOD1 and NOD2 Are Potential Therapeutic Targets for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'PD-L1, a Potential Immunomodulator Linking Immunology and Orthodontically Induced Inflammatory Root Resorption (OIIRR): Friend or Foe?']"""

PSMA PET/CT is a molecular imaging tool for whole-body imaging of prostate cancer and may inform on the mechanisms of radium-223 activity and treatment resistance in mCRPC patients.  Methods:   In an open-label, single-arm, prospective trial, we enrolled patients with bone-predominant mCRPC to undergo baseline PSMA PET/CT, 6 cycles of radium-223, and post-therapy PSMA PET/CT. We assessed the relationship between multiple parameters of interval change on PSMA PET/CT on aPROMISE PSMA automated analysis and a human reader, and laboratory measurements.  Results:   Fourteen patients were enrolled and 9 patients completed both protocol-defined PSMA PET/CT. Of the 9 evaluable patients, 1 (11%) had a complete response and 8 (89%) had PSMA PET progressive disease. All patients showed decreases in PSMA uptake in some disease sites evident on the baseline scan. The change in overall burden of disease on PSMA PET was more strongly correlated with changes in PSA (Ï = 0.95) than ALP (Ï = 0.62). Progression in bone was a common finding on post-treatment PSMA PET/CT.  Conclusion:   PSMA PET was able to assess response in individual lesions during radium-223 therapy in mCRPC patients. PSMA PET responses in previously established disease sites were universal, but most patients also showed overall PSMA PET progression during 6 cycles of radium-223. Given high correlation with changes in PSA, PSMA PET may be of limited value in follow-up during or after radium-223 in bone-predominant mCRPC.""","""['Stephan Probst', 'Anders Bjartell', 'Aseem Anand', 'Tayna Skamene', 'Cristiano Ferrario']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['AlphaBet: Combination of Radium-223 and 17 7LuLu-PSMA-I&T in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (clinical trial protocol).', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-Ã -vis Gleason score in such cohort.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Preliminary results on response assessment using 68Ga-HBED-CC-PSMA PET/CT in patients with metastatic prostate cancer undergoing docetaxel chemotherapy.', 'Response assessment using 68 GaGa-PSMA ligand PET in patients undergoing systemic therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

While many nonprostate solid tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) express little PSMA, their neovasculature expresses a high level of PSMA, which is avid for Gallium-68-labeled PSMA-targeting radio-ligand (68Ga-PSMA-11) for positron emission tomography (PET). However, the lack of a spontaneous animal model of tumor-associated vascular PSMA overexpression has hindered the development and assessment of PSMA-targeting radioligands for imaging and therapy of the nonprostatic cancers. We identified detectable indigenous PSMA expression on tumor neovascular endothelia in a naturally occurring woodchuck model of HCC.  Methods:   Molecular docking was performed with 3 bait PSMA ligands and compared between human and woodchuck PSMA. Initially, PET images were acquired dynamically after intravenously injecting 37 MBq (1.0 mCi) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 into woodchuck models of HCC. Subsequently, 10-minute static PET scans were conducted for other animals 1-hour after injection due to HCC and liver background uptake stabilization at 30-45 minutes after injection. Liver tissue samples were harvested after imaging, fresh-frozen for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot for validation, or fixed for histology for correlation.  Results:   Our preclinical studies confirmed the initial clinical findings of 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in HCC. The agents (ligands and antibodies) developed against human PSMA were found to be reactive against the woodchuck PSMA.

Methods and materials:   Data of 3409 patients who underwent RARP was retrieved from a high-volume institute database, and 313 patients with persistent PSA were included in further analyses. Patients who received sRT and those who did not were compared after propensity score matching. Progression-free survival (PFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)-free, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival, as well as patient-reported outcomes were the endpoints. Multivariable Cox regression models were developed to reveal treatment effect sizes for the subgroups.  Results:   The overall persistent PSA rate was 9.2%, and the median follow-up time after RARP was 4.5 years (interquartile range, 2.7-7.9 years). The sRT was associated with improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.29; P < .001), ADT-free survival (HR: 0.34; P < .001), MFS (HR: 0.39; P = .001), cancer-specific survival (HR: 0.34; P = .03), and overall survival (HR: 0.24; P = .001). Positive surgical margins (HR: 0.26; P < .001 for ADT-free survival), advanced pathological T stage (HR: 0.24; P < .001 for PFS) and positive lymph nodes (HR: 0.15; P = .001 for MFS), and lower Gleason score (HR: 0.15; P = .001 for PFS) were associated with marked survival benefits of sRT. Bowel symptoms were observed more frequently in patients who had sRT with or without ADT compared with patients with persistent PSA but no sRT (34.3% vs 19.2%; P = .01). Early sRT (<6 months after surgery) was associated with bothering incontinence (P < .001) and bowel symptoms (P = .03).

Here, we investigate the cytotoxic effects of Plasma Conditioned Medium (PCM) in combination with DOX in prostate cancer cells from bone metastases (PC-3) as well as in non-malignant bone-cells. PCM was able to enhance the cytotoxic potential of DOX both in monolayer and in a 3D bioengineered model mimicking the bone matrix. The combined treatment of PCM + DOX resulted in a profound downregulation of the redox defenses (CAT1, SOD2, GPX1) and drug resistance genes (MRP1, MDR1, BCRP1), resulting in an enhanced uptake of DOX coupled to an overload of intracellular ROS. Besides, PCM improved the cytotoxic potential of DOX interfering on the migratory and clonogenic potential of PC-3 cells. Importantly, non-malignant bone cells were unaffected by the combination of PCM + DOX.

Postoperative erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence are common associated adverse side effects that can negatively impact patients' quality of life. Preserving the lateral neurovascular bundles (NS) during RARP improves functional outcomes. However, selecting men for NS may be difficult when there is concern about incurring in positive surgical margin (PSM) which in turn risks adverse oncological outcomes. The NeuroSAFE technique (intra-operative frozen section examination of the neurovascular structure adjacent prostate margin) can provide real-time pathological consult to promote optimal NS whilst avoiding PSM.  Methods:   NeuroSAFE PROOF is a single-blinded, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) in which men are randomly allocated 1:1 to either NeuroSAFE RARP or standard RARP. Men electing for RARP as primary treatment, who are continent and have good baseline erectile function (EF), defined by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) score > 21, are eligible. NS in the intervention arm is guided by the NeuroSAFE technique. NS in the standard arm is based on standard of care, i.e. a pre-operative image-based planning meeting, patient-specific clinical information, and digital rectal examination. The primary outcome is assessment of EF at 12 months. The primary endpoint is the proportion of men who achieve IIEF-5 score â¥ 21. A sample size of 404 was calculated to give a power of 90% to detect a difference of 14% between groups based on a feasibility study. Oncological outcomes are continuously monitored by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. Key secondary outcomes include urinary continence at 3 months assessed by the international consultation on incontinence questionnaire, rate of biochemical recurrence, EF recovery at 24 months, and difference in quality of life.  Discussion:   NeuroSAFE PROOF is the first RCT of intra-operative frozen section during radical prostatectomy in the world.

A step towards achieving better outcomes is the systematic provision of education materials to patients and caregivers throughout the cancer trajectory. An audit of patient education (PE) materials was conducted at a cancer center to identify content gaps and determine areas for future development. The PE audit was conducted in all outpatient clinics (13) and clinic-specific PE materials were identified, reviewed, and categorized by cancer type and under the following topics: About Cancer/Disease, Medical Tests and Imaging, Treatment, Symptom Management, Rehabilitation/Survivorship, General Wellbeing, Medical Device Care, Practical and Other. Four hundred forty-seven PE materials were included in the audit. Totals for each topic were summed and analyzed for education development opportunities. Results varied based on clinic and cancer type. Majority of the materials were found in the following clinics: Hematology (75), Genitourinary (74), and Gastrointestinal (57). The most common information topics were treatment (277), about cancer/disease (134), and symptom management (120). When broken down by cancer type, it was clear that while the collection of PE materials is well established for some diagnoses (e.g., 28 prostate cancer materials), there is a significant dearth in materials for others (e.g., 0 penile cancer materials). Audit results will be used to identify opportunities for future education material development.

Materials and methods:   Prospectively undersampled 5D echo-planar J-resolved spectroscopic imaging (EP-JRESI) data were acquired in nine prostate cancer (PCa) patients and three healthy males. The 5D EP-JRESI data were reconstructed using DL and compared with gradient sparsity-based Total Variation (TV) and Perona-Malik (PM) methods. A hybrid reconstruction technique, Dictionary Learning-Total Variation (DLTV), was also designed to further improve the quality of reconstructed spectra.

Objectives:   We report the results of a cost-utility analysis of the RESPECT-21 study using difference-in-differences, which investigated the reconfiguration of specialist surgery services for four cancers in an area of London, compared to the Rest of England (ROE).  Methods:   Electronic health records data were obtained from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service for patients diagnosed with one of the four cancers of interest between 2012 and 2017. The analysis for each tumour type used a short-term decision tree followed by a 10-year Markov model with 6-monthly cycles. Costs were calculated by applying National Health Service (NHS) Reference Costs to patient-level hospital resource use and supplemented with published data. Cancer-specific preference-based health-related quality-of-life values were obtained from the literature to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Total costs and QALYs were calculated before and after the reconfiguration, in the London Cancer (LC) area and in ROE, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to illustrate the uncertainty in the results.  Results:   At a threshold of Â£30,000/QALY gained, LC reconfiguration of prostate cancer surgery services had a 79% probability of having been cost-effective compared to non-reconfigured services using difference-in-differences. The oesophago-gastric, bladder and renal reconfigurations had probabilities of 62%, 49% and 12%, respectively, of being cost-effective at the same threshold. Costs and QALYs per surgical patient increased over time for all cancers across both regions to varying degrees. Bladder cancer surgery had the smallest patient numbers and changes in costs, and QALYs were not significant. The largest improvement in outcomes was in renal cancer surgery in ROE, making the relative renal improvements in LC appear modest, and the probability of the LC reconfiguration having been cost-effective low.  Conclusions:   Prostate cancer reconfigurations had the highest probability of being cost-effective. It is not clear, however, whether the prostate results can be considered in isolation, given the reconfigurations occurred simultaneously with other system changes, and healthcare delivery in the NHS is highly networked and collaborative.

Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was completed using NVivo software v10. Receipt of PV/LPV or VUS genetic test results was not as emotional as receiving the diagnosis of PCA itself. Seven of the 12 participants chose to share their test results with all relevant family members, 4 chose to share with select family members, and one chose to not disclose to any family members. The majority of family members who were aware of participants' genetic results have not undergone cascade genetic testing or sought cancer screening.

Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the pathological results of patients undergoing transperineal prostate biopsy with PI-RADS 4 and 5 in our center. We use the data from 2019 to 2020 as the training set to establish the prediction model and the data from 2021 as the verification set to test the effectiveness. Through stepwise logistics regression analysis, we integrate statistically significant clinical factors and establish a model to further predict whether the target area is tumor.  Results:   The results showed that age (O), total number of lesions (T), histological region (R), PI-RADS score (S), and PSA density (P) were significantly correlated with the results of TB, and the formula was: p = 1/[1 + e^(- 11.387 + 0.058 Ã O + (- 0.736 Ã T) + 0.587 Ã R + 1.574 Ã S + 7.338 Ã P)].

Here we investigate the influence of EphA2 signalling in PCa progression and long-term survival.  Methods:   The mechanisms underpinning metastatic biopotential of altered EphA2 signalling in relation to PTEN status were assessed in vitro using canonical (EphA2D739N) and non-canonical (EphA2S897G) PC3-M mutants, interrogation of publicly available PTEN-stratified databases and clinical validation using a PCa TMA (n = 177) with long-term follow-up data. Spatial heterogeneity of EphA2 was assessed using a radical prostatectomy cohort (n = 67).  Results:   Non-canonical EphA2 signalling via pEphA2S897 is required for PCa transendothelial invasion of bone marrow endothelium. High expression of EphA2 or pEphA2S897 in a PTENlow background is associated with poor overall survival. Expression of EphA2, pEphA2S897 and the associated MAT marker pMLC2 are spatially regulated with the highest levels found within lesion areas within 500 Âµm of the prostate margin.

Cohort of men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer (T1/T2 and low/intermediate risk) from ten Spanish hospitals, followed for 10 years. The treatment selection was decided jointly by patients and physicians. Of 704 participants, 192 were treated with open radical retropubic prostatectomy, 317 with 125I brachytherapy alone, and 195 with 3D external beam radiation. We evaluated overall survival, prostate cancer-specific mortality, and biochemical recurrence. Kaplan-Meier estimators were plotted, and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were constructed to estimate hazard ratios (HR), adjusted by propensity scores. Of the 704 participants, 542 patients were alive ten years after treatment, and a total of 13 patients have been lost during follow-up. After adjusting by propensity score and Gleason score, brachytherapy and external radiotherapy were not associated with decreased 10-year overall survival (aHR = 1.36, p = 0.292 and aHR = 1.44, p = 0.222), but presented higher biochemical recurrence (aHR = 1.93, p = 0.004 and aHR = 2.56, p < 0.001) than radical prostatectomy at ten years of follow-up.

Results:   Curcumin and paclitaxel co-treatment significantly reduced the IC50 value in CD44+cells compared to paclitaxel alone. Additionally, combining these drugs considerably increased apoptosis in CD44+cells.

Although androgen depletion therapy (ADT) is the primary treatment for most prostate cancers, they acquires resistance to ADT and become castration resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). AR complex formation with multiple transcription factors is important for enhancer activity and transcriptional regulation, which can contribute to cancer progression and resistance to ADT. We previously demonstrated that OCT1 collaborates with AR in prostate cancer, and that a pyrrole-imidazole (PI) polyamide (PIP) targeting OCT1 inhibits cell and castration-resistant tumor growth (Obinata D et al. Oncogene 2016). PIP can bind to DNA non-covalently without a drug delivery system unlike most DNA targeted therapeutics. In the present study, we developed a PIP modified with a DNA alkylating agent, chlorambucil (ChB) (OCT1-PIP-ChB). Then its effect on the growth of prostate cancer LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC3 cells, pancreatic cancer BxPC3 cells, and colon cancer HCT116 cells, as well as non-cancerous MCF-10A epithelial cells, were analyzed. It was shown that the IC50s of OCT1-PIP-ChB for 22Rv1 and LNCaP were markedly lower compared to other cells, including non-cancerous MCF-10A cells. Comprehensive gene expression analysis of CRPC model 22Rv1 cells treated with IC50 concentrations of OCT1-PIP-ChB revealed that the gene group involved in DNA double-strand break repair was the most enriched among gene sets repressed by OCT1-PIP-ChB treatment. Importantly, in vivo study using 22Rv1 xenografts, we showed that OCT1-PIP-ChB significantly reduced tumor growth compared to the control group without showing obvious adverse effects. Thus, the PIP combined with ChB can exert a significant inhibitory effect on prostate cancer cell proliferation and castration-resistant tumor growth, suggesting a potential role as a therapeutic agent.""","""['Daigo Funakoshi', 'Daisuke Obinata', 'Kyoko Fujiwara', 'Shinichiro Yamamoto', 'Kenichi Takayama', 'Makoto Hara', 'Satoru Takahashi', 'Satoshi Inoue']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Targeting Oct1 genomic function inhibits androgen receptor signaling and castration-resistant prostate cancer growth.', 'Integrative Genomic Analysis of OCT1 Reveals Coordinated Regulation of Androgen Receptor in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of new octamer transcription factor 1-target genes upregulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Crosstalk of the Androgen Receptor with Transcriptional Collaborators: Potential Therapeutic Targets for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'DeepAR: a novel deep learning-based hybrid framework for the interpretable prediction of androgen receptor antagonists.']"""

To characterize prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) progression, we conducted longitudinal studies on Pten(i)pe-/- mice that recapitulate prostate carcinogenesis in humans. We found that early PINs are hypoxic and that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) signaling is activated in luminal cells, thus enhancing malignant progression. Luminal HIF1A dampens immune surveillance and drives luminal plasticity, leading to the emergence of cells that overexpress Transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) and have impaired androgen signaling. Elevated TGM2 levels in patients with PCa are associated with shortened progression-free survival after prostatectomy.

HML-2 is the most biologically active subgroup of the HERV-K family, and expression of its members has been associated with many cancer types. The LTRs of HML-2 have been classified into three subgroups (LTR5A, LTR5B, and LTR5Hs) based on phylogenetic analyses. The current study aimed to explore the LTR transcriptional activity differences among the three subtypes and further explore the underlying factors. A total of 43 LTR5A elements, 62 LTR5B elements, and 194 LTR5Hs elements were selected. A phylogenetic tree showed that the LTR5Hs group was clearly separated from the LTR5A and LTR5B groups. A luciferase reporter assay indicated that LTR5Hs had the strongest promoter activity, followed by LTR5A and LTR5B. To investigate the underlying factors, LTR5Hs was divided into 4 sections, and the homologous fragments in LTR5B were replaced successively. Replacement of the third section (-263 to 0) significantly increased LTR5B activity. Subsequent mutation experiments revealed that the increased transcriptional activity was induced by the TATA box and the two p53 binding sites within the section. Further interference with TP53 significantly decreased LTR5Hs transcriptional activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and CUT&Tag experiments finally confirmed the direct binding of the p53 protein with the two LTR5Hs p53 binding sites. Overall, the two p53 binding sites in the third section (-263 to 0) of LTR5Hs were revealed to play critical roles in the difference in transcriptional activity among the three subtypes. IMPORTANCE Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) were integrated into the human genome in ancient times and have been coevolving with the host. Since the Human Genome Project, HERVs have attracted increasing attention. Many studies have focused on their characterization, evolution, and biological function. In particular, the expression of HERV-K has been associated with many diseases, such as germ cell tumors, neurotoxicity, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. Indeed, two HML-2-produced proteins, Np9 and Rec, are associated with certain cancers. However, their roles in these disease associations remain unclear. The current work focused on subgroup HML-2 of HERV-K, which is recognized as the most biologically active subgroup, and aimed to explore the mechanistic basis of transcriptional activity. The results revealed that p53 deeply determined the activity of HML-2 LTR5Hs. p53 is a rather important tumor suppressor protein. It can regulate the expression of genes related to cell cycle arrest, organic processes, and apoptosis in response to cellular stress and is critical for the control of homeostasis. Previous ChIP and expression studies of individual genes suggested that p53 sites in HERV LTRs may be part of the p53 transcription program and directly regulate p53 target genes in a species-specific manner. However, the exact function of p53 in the regulation of HERV LTR expression is largely elusive. Our results clearly demonstrated the interaction between LTR5Hs of HML-2 and p53. They are of great significance for the future comprehensive study of the physiological and pathological functions of LTRs of HERVs.""","""['Mengying Liu#', 'Lei Jia#', 'Hanping Li', 'Yongjian Liu', 'Jingwan Han', 'Xiaolin Wang', 'Tianyi Li', 'Jingyun Li', 'Bohan Zhang', 'Xiuli Zhai', 'Changyuan Yu', 'Lin Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Microbiol Spectr""","""['CpG methylation directly regulates transcriptional activity of the human endogenous retrovirus family HERV-K(HML-2).', 'Systematic identification and characterization of regulatory elements derived from human endogenous retroviruses.', 'Movements of Ancient Human Endogenous Retroviruses Detected in SOX2-Expressing Cells.', 'Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HML-2) in Health and Disease.', 'Epigenetic Control of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Expression: Focus on Regulation of Long-Terminal Repeats (LTRs).', 'Comprehensive Analysis and Drug Modulation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus in Hepatocellular Carcinomas.', 'Anti-HERV-K Drugs and Vaccines, Possible Therapies against Tumors.', 'Human Endogenous Retrovirus, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV Promote PAH via Inflammation and Growth Stimulation.', 'Human Endogenous Retroviruses: Friends and Foes in Urology Clinics.', 'Evolutionary analysis of endogenous intronic retroviruses in primates reveals an enrichment in transcription binding sites associated with key regulatory processes.']"""

However, the risk of total cancer development and malignant potential from these diseases is largely unknown. Systematic data on the risk of cancer development from these diseases are missing. Therefore, the goal of this study is to analyze the risk of total cancer development in chronic liver diseases.  Methods:   A cohort of 15,706 patients with chronic hepatitis and 15,706 patients without hepatitis were matched by propensity scoring from outpatient practices in Germany over a period of 15 years. Cox regression models were conducted to study the association between alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C and cancer incidence, including liver, other digestive organs, skin, prostate, breast and lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue cancer.  Results:   Within 10 years of the index date, 19.3% of patients with alcoholic hepatitis and 13.4% of non-hepatitis individuals were diagnosed with cancer (log-rank p = 0.035). These proportions were 15.0 vs. 9.9% (p = 0.078) for autoimmune hepatitis, 8.7 vs. 7.1% (p = 0.015) for hepatitis B, and 12.7 vs. 7.6% (p < 0.001) for hepatitis C. In regression analyses, only alcoholic hepatitis (HR: 1.84, 95% CI 1.32-2.54) and hepatitis C (HR: 2.10, 95% CI 1.77-2.50) were significantly associated with increased risk of cancer. There was a very strong positive association between hepatitis C and liver cancer (HR: 78.2 (95% CI 10.9-560.7). Furthermore, hepatitis C was associated with an increased risk of respiratory organ cancer (HR: 2.59, 95% CI 1.42-4.73).

Untargeted metabolomics can produce an unbiased global metabolic profile, with the opportunity for uncovering new plasma metabolites prospectively associated with risk of PCa, providing insights into disease etiology. We conducted a prospective untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis using prediagnostic fasting plasma samples from 752 PCa case-control pairs nested within the Northern Sweden Health and Disease Study (NSHDS). The pairs were matched by age, BMI, and sample storage time. Discriminating features were identified by a combination of orthogonal projection to latent structures-effect projections (OPLS-EP) and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Their prospective associations with PCa risk were investigated by conditional logistic regression. Subgroup analyses based on stratification by disease aggressiveness and baseline age were also conducted. Various free fatty acids and phospholipids were positively associated with overall risk of PCa and in various stratification subgroups. Aromatic amino acids were positively associated with overall risk of PCa. Uric acid was positively, and glucose negatively, associated with risk of PCa in the older subgroup. This is the largest untargeted LC-MS based metabolomics study to date on plasma metabolites prospectively associated with risk of developing PCa.

Current knowledge comes from high-volume centers, but little is known about the performance of this surgery from community practices. This study aims to report contemporary AUS performance in a nationwide observational study in Colombia.  Methods:   Male patients who underwent AUS surgery with AMS 800â¢ between 2000 and 2020 in more than 17 centers and four cities were identified. Pre, intra, and postoperative characteristics were evaluated, mainly addressing patient reported outcomes measurements in the postoperative period. Retrospective and prospective data collection and descriptive analysis were completed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine AUS survival rate.  Results:   Out of an initial 667 cases, a total of 215 patients met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included. Mean age was 67 Â± 9.4 years, and mean follow-up was 6.0 Â± 4.4 years with maximum range of 14 years. The etiology of urinary incontinence was prostate cancer surgery in 141 (81%) of the cases. The rest of the cases were related to benign prostatic disease or spinal cord injury. It is noteworthy that out of 115 patients, only 59 (51.3%) reported previous formal pelvic floor rehabilitation. Subjective severity of urinary incontinence determined by a visual analog scale showed a decrease in 4.5 points after sphincter implantation. Sphincter removal was required in 50 (23.2%) cases. The main reasons for implant removal were urethral erosion and infection. The sphincter survival rate at 2, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years was 76%, 70%, 60%, 57%, and 17%, respectively. Of the subjects at the last follow-up with the device still in place, 80.7% defined their urinary condition as ""does not cause or causes minor discomfort,"" and 99% would recommend the device to a friend or relative in the same condition.  Conclusions:   This series from a community-based practice shows the lack of adherence to clinical practice guidelines and the lack of standardized data collection.

Design:   Disease-specific phantoms were developed to train physicians in mpMRI-guided fusion prostate biopsy, brachytherapy, and rectal spacer insertion. Training was remotely demonstrated using 1-way virtual video conferencing format. Participants responded to an educational content survey. A heads-up display with software and augmented reality was used for remote 2-way training with the proctor and student using on their own phantoms.  Setting:   The virtual video meeting took place during a prostate cancer conference in 2020, while the augmented reality training occurred in 2021. The proctor and student wore a heads-up display containing a projector and webcam where the ultrasound image was displayed onto a see-through optic along with the physician's hands. The heads-up display allowed the proctor to teach by line-of-sight while the student watched and repeated the steps.  Participants:   Faculty with expertise with the medical devices used in these procedures provided training to urologists unfamiliar with these techniques.  Results:   Participants responded that the 1-way training on the phantoms was realistic and mimicked human tissue. A total of 70.9% requested more training or training on the phantoms. The remote training platform was successfully beta tested at the 2 locations in transperineal prostate biopsy and rectal spacer insertion.  Conclusion:   Remote training using augmented reality eliminates the need for travel.

To explore the potential microbiome signature associated with PCa in Indian patients, we investigated differential compositions of commensal bacteria among patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and PCa using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing followed by qPCR analyses using two distinct primer sets. Using two independent cohorts, we show that Prevotella copri, Cupriavidus campinensis, and Propionibacterium acnes represent the three most abundant bacteria in diseased prostate lesions. LEfSe analyses identified that while Cupriavidus taiwanensis and Methylobacterium organophilum are distinctly elevated in PCa samples, Kocuria palustris and Cellvibrio mixtus are significantly enriched in BPH samples. Furthermore, we identify that a number of human tumor viruses, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), along with two high-risk human papillomaviruses - HPV-16 and HPV-18, are significantly associated with the PCa development and strongly correlated with PCa bacterial signature.

The long noncoding RNA SNHG family has been recognized as a prognostic marker in cancers and contributes to the progression of multiple cancers, including PC. In this study, we aimed to clarify the prognostic values and underlying mechanisms of SNHGs in promoting the progression and modulating the tumor microenvironment of PC through data mining based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We identified that within the SNHG family, SNHG17 was most correlated with the overall survival of PC patients and could act as an independent predictor. Moreover, we constructed a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network by which SNHG17 promotes progression and potentially inhibits the immune infiltration and immune response of prostate cancer. By interacting with miR-23a-3p/23b-3p/23c, SNHG17 upregulates the expression of UBE2M and OTUB1, which have been demonstrated to play critical roles in the tumorigenesis of human cancers, more importantly promoting cancer cell immunosuppression and resistance to cytotoxic stimulation. Finally, we examined the correlation between SNHG17 expression and the clinical progression of PC patients based on our cohort of 52 PC patients. We also verified the SNHG17/miR-23a/OTUB1 axis in RV-1 and PC-3 cells by dual luciferase and RIP assays, and we further identified that SNHG17 promoted cellular invasive capacity by modulating OTUB1. In summary, the current study conducted a ceRNA-based SNHG17-UBE2M/OTUB1 axis and indicated that SNHG17 might be a novel prognostic factor associated with the progression, immunosuppression, and cytotoxic resistance of PC.""","""['Jinling Li#', 'Hongyuan Yu#', 'Jinlong Yao', 'Zhenming Jiang', 'Zhenhua Li', 'Xiaolu Cui']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""['SNHG17 promotes colorectal tumorigenesis and metastasis via regulating Trim23-PES1 axis and miR-339-5p-FOSL2-SNHG17 positive feedback loop.', 'LncRNA SNHG17 promotes tumor progression and predicts poor survival in human renal cell carcinoma via sponging miR-328-3p.', 'LncRNA SNHG17 aggravated prostate cancer progression through regulating its homolog SNORA71B via a positive feedback loop.', 'Integrative pan-cancer analysis indicates the prognostic importance of long noncoding RNA SNHG17 in human cancers.', 'Enabling factor for cancer hallmark acquisition: Small nucleolar RNA host gene 17.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of serum creatinine in the prognostic risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS We identified 1134 eligible patients from the ""Prostate Cancer Data Set"" in the National Clinical Medical Science Data Center. Patients with prostate cancer were divided high- and low-risk prognostic groups according to prostate-specific antigen levels and Gleason scores and were divided into 5 groups according to serum creatinine quintile: Q1 (<70.1 umol/L), Q2 (70.1-76.8 umol/L), Q3 (76.8-83.4 umol/L), Q4 (83.4-92.1 umol/L), and Q5 (>92.1 umol/L). Multivariate logistic regression and a multiple restricted cubic spline method were used to evaluate the relationship between serum creatinine level and the level of prostate cancer prognostic risk. RESULTS Of the 1134 patients with prostate cancer, 134 (11.8%) had a high-risk prognosis. Compared with the Q2 group (the reference group), the lowest serum creatinine levels in the Q1 group and the highest serum creatinine levels in groups Q5, Q3, and Q4 were associated with a high-risk prognosis, and this association remained significant after adjusting for confounders. The multiple restricted cubic spline regression model showed the relationship between serum creatinine level and high-risk prognosis was U-shaped. CONCLUSIONS Serum creatinine level was an independent predictor of high-risk prognosis. Controlling serum creatinine levels between 70.1 and 76.8 umol/L in patients with prostatic cancer may benefit the prognosis of patients with prostatic cancer.""","""['Xingbo Gu', 'Jiaojiao Wu', 'Xuefeidan Liu', 'Yun Hong', 'Yaoxi Wu', 'Ye Tian']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Serum vitamin D concentration and prostate cancer risk: a nested case-control study.', 'Use of serum creatinine to predict pathologic stage and recurrence among radical prostatectomy patients.', 'The Urinary Sarcosine/Creatinine Ratio is a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker in Prostate Cancer.', 'Nadir creatinine in posterior urethral valves: How high is low enough?', 'Improving Clinical Risk Stratification at Diagnosis in Primary Prostate Cancer: A Prognostic Modelling Study.']"""

Previous studies suggested IDC-P could have a potentially unstable genome. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score is a result-oriented method to describe the genomic instability status. This study investigates the association of HRD scores with IDC-P and other clinicopathological factors and the prognostic implication of HRD scores in an aggressive prostate cancer cohort.  Methods:   This study involved 123 PCa patients, including high-risk localized (M0) and de novo metastatic (M1) diseases. HRD score is calculated based on over 10,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms distributed across the human genome. We explored the association between HRD scores and clinicopathological characteristics, genomic alterations, and patients' prognoses using rank-sum tests, chi-square tests, Kaplan-Meier curves, and Cox proportional hazards method.  Results:   The median HRD score of this cohort is 21.0, with 65 (52.8%) patients showing HRD scoreâ¥21. Tumors with IDC-P displayed higher HRD scores than adenocarcinoma (P=0.002); other high HRD score-related factors included M1 (P =0.008) and high ISUP grades (4-5) (P=0.001). MYC mutations were associated with high HRD scores (P<0.001) in the total cohort. TP53 mutations (P=0.010) and HRR pathway mutations (P=0.028) corresponded to high HRD scores in IDC-P positive and non-IDC-P patients, respectively, but not vice versa. HRD scores higher than 21 indicated significantly worse survival in the total cohort.  Conclusions:   M1, high Gleason score, and IDC-P pathology represent higher HRD scores in PCa. Tumors with IDC-P might have different driven mechanisms for high HRD scores than non-IDC-P.

Methods:   Ten North American and European cohorts from the Prostate Biopsy Collaborative Group (PBCG) were used for fitting a risk prediction tool for clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as Gleason grade group â¥ 2 on standard TRUS prostate biopsy. One large European PBCG cohort was withheld for external validation, where calibration-in-the-large (CIL), calibration curves, and area-underneath-the-receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) were evaluated. Ten-fold leave-one-cohort-internal validation further validated the optimal missing data approach.  Results:   Among 12,703 biopsies from 10 training cohorts, 3,597 (28%) had clinically significant prostate cancer, compared to 1,757 of 5,540 (32%) in the external validation cohort. In external validation, the available cases method that pooled individual patient data containing all risk factors input by an end-user had best CIL, under-predicting risks as percentages by 2.9% on average, and obtained an AUC of 75.7%. Imputation had the worst CIL (-13.3%). The available cases method was further validated as optimal in internal cross-validation and thus used for development of an online risk tool. For end-users of the risk tool, two risk factors were mandatory: serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and age, and ten were optional: digital rectal exam, prostate volume, prior negative biopsy, 5-alpha-reductase-inhibitor use, prior PSA screen, African ancestry, Hispanic ethnicity, first-degree prostate-, breast-, and second-degree prostate-cancer family history.

In this study, the impact of [68Ga]Ga-RM2 positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) for the detection of primary PCa was compared with that of [18F]FCH PET-CT and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI).  Methods:   This phase I/II study was conducted in 30 biopsy-positive PCa subjects. The patients were stratified into high (10 patients), intermediate (10 patients), and low risk (10 patients) for extraglandular metastases as defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria (NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, 2016). The prostate gland was classified in 12 anatomic segments for data analysis of the imaging modalities as well as histopathologic findings. The segment with the highest radiotracer uptake was defined as the ""index lesion."" All cases were scheduled to undergo prostatectomy with pelvic lymph node (LN) dissection in intermediate- and high-risk patients. Intraprostatic and pelvic nodal [68Ga]Ga-RM2 and [18F]FCH PET-CT findings were correlated with mpMRI and histopathologic results.  Results:   Of the 312 analyzed regions, 120 regions (4 to 8 lesions per patient) showed abnormal findings in the prostate gland. In a region-based analysis, overall sensitivity and specificity of [68Ga]Ga-RM2 PET-CT in the detection of primary tumor were 74% and 90%, respectively, while it was 60% and 80% for [18F]FCH PET-CT and 72% and 89% for mpMRI. Although the overall sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-RM2 PET-CT was higher compared to that of [18F]FCH PET-CT and mpMRI, the statistical analysis showed only significant difference between [68Ga]Ga-RM2 PET-CT and [18F]FCH PET-CT in the intermediate-risk group (p = 0.01) and [68Ga]Ga-RM2 PET-CT and mpMRT in the high-risk group (p = 0.03). In the lesion-based analysis, there was no significant difference between SUVmax of [68Ga]Ga-RM2 and [18F]FCH PET-CT in the intraprostatic malignant lesions ([68Ga]Ga-RM2: mean SUVmax: 5.98 Â± 4.13, median: 4.75; [18F]FCH: mean SUVmax: 6.08 Â± 2.74, median: 5.5; p = 0.13).  Conclusions:   [68Ga]Ga-RM2 showed promising PET tracer for the detection of intraprostatic PCa in a cohort of patients with different risk stratifications.

Identification of clinically actionable molecular subtypes of PCa is key to improving patient outcome, and the balance between specific pathways may influence PCa outcome. It is also urgent to identify progression-related markers through cytosine-guanine (CpG) methylation in predicting metastasis for patients with PCa.  Methods:   We performed bioinformatics analysis of transcriptomic, and clinical data in an integrated cohort of 551 prostate samples. The datasets included retrospective The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts. Two algorithms, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selector Operation and Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination, were used to select significant CpGs.  Results:   We found that PCa progression is more likely to occur after the third year through conditional survival (CS) analysis, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was a better predictor of Progression-free survival (PFS) than Gleason score (GS). Our study first demonstrated that PCa tumors have distinct expression profiles based on the expression of genes involved in androgen receptor (AR) and PI3K-AKT, which influence disease outcome. Our results also indicated that there are multiple phenotypes relevant to the AR-PI3K axis in PCa, where tumors with mixed phenotype may be more aggressive or have worse outcome than quiescent phenotype. In terms of epigenetics, we obtained CpG sites and their corresponding genes which have a good predictive value of PFS.

In this study, treatment patterns and utilization of treatment intensification in mCSPC patients were described using the IQVIA Anonymized Patient Longitudinal Data, a dataset of fully adjudicated pharmacy and medical claims.  Patients and methods:   Reports on first line (1L) treatment patterns were obtained for years 2015 to 2021. Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare part D, cash transactions, and commercial data were included for years 2012 to 2021.  Results:   Nationwide, of 66,844 men with newly diagnosed mCSPC since 2015, on average 25% were prescribed NHT, and another 12% were prescribed chemotherapy. No differences were noted in treatment patterns based on U.S. regions and/or rural vs. urban communities. The disparity was observed in prescribing patterns between oncology and urology providers. Oncology providers prescribed 1L NHT on average 32% of the time, while urology providers did so 12% of the time. Furthermore, oncology providers prescribed chemotherapy on average 20% of the time, resulting in 52% of men with mCSPC receiving treatment intensification as 1L therapy.

More than 8 million tons of phthalates are used each year, predominantly as plasticizers in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) products. Phthalates are widely used in everyday consumer products and improperly discarded into the environment. Furthermore, in vivo studies carried out in our laboratory showed that a mixture of phthalates, equivalent to the mixture used in this study, deregulated the expression of genes and miRNAs associated with prostatic carcinogenic pathways. Thus, this study was designed to establish an in vitro model to assess pathways related to cell survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and biosynthesis of miRNAs, using both normal and tumoral prostatic epithelial cells exposed to an environmentally relevant mixture of phthalate metabolites. Tumor (LNCaP) and normal (PNT-2) prostatic epithelial cell lines were exposed for 24 and 72 h to vehicle control or the phthalate mixture. The selected metabolite mixture (1000 Î¼mol/L) consisted of 36.7% monoethyl phthalate (MEP), 19.4% mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), 15.3% monobutyl phthalate (MBP), 10.2% monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), 10.2% monoisononyl phthalate (MiNP), and 8.2% monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP). Gene expression was performed by qRT-PCR and cell migratory potential was measured using cell migration assays. Our results showed that the mixture of phthalates increased cell turnover, oxidative stress, biosynthesis, and expression of miRNAs in LNCaP cells; thus, increasing their cellular expansive and migratory potential and modulating tumor behavior, making them possibly more aggressive.

Prostatic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote prostate cancer growth and are abundant in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), suggesting a role in promoting CRPC. We recently showed a tumor cell-intrinsic mechanism by which RON promotes CRPC. Given previous reports that RON alters prostate cancer cell chemokine production and RON-overexpressing tumors alter macrophage function, we hypothesized that a macrophage-dependent mechanism regulated by tumor cell intrinsic RON also promotes CRPC.  Methods:   Using RON-modulated genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and GEMM-derived cell lines and co-cultures with bone marrow-derived macrophages, we show functional and molecular characteristics of signaling pathways in supporting CRPC. Further, we used an unbiased phosphokinase array to identify pathway interactions regulated by RON. Finally, using human prostate cancer cell lines and prostate cancer patient data sets, we show the relevance of our findings to human prostate cancer.  Results:   Studies herein show that macrophages recruited into the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) serve as a source for Gas6 secretion which serves to further enhance RON and Axl receptor activation in prostate tumor cells thereby driving CRPC.

The essential role of autophagy in the progression of PCa and treatment resistance has been preliminarily revealed. However, comprehensive molecular elucidations of the correlation between PCa and autophagy are rare.  Method:   We obtained transcription information and corresponding clinicopathological profiles of PCa patients from TCGA, MSKCC, and GEO datasets. LAASO analysis was employed to select gene signatures and estimate the autophagy score for each patient. Correlations between the signature and prognosis of PCa were investigated by K-M and multivariate Cox regression analyses. A nomogram was established on the basis of the above results. Further validations relied on ROC, calibration analysis, decision curve analysis, and external cohorts. Variable activated signaling pathways were revealed using GSVA algorithms, and the genetic alteration landscape was elucidated via the oncodrive module from the ""maftools"" R package. In addition, we also examined the therapeutic role of the signature based on phenotype data from GDSC 2016.  Result:   Six autophagy-related genes were eventually selected to establish the signature, including ULK1, CAPN10, FKBP5, UBE2T, NLRC4, and BNIP3L. We used these genes and corresponding coefficients to calculate an autophagy score (AutS) for each patient in this study. A high AutS group and a low AutS group were divided on the mean AutS of the patients. Longer overall survival, higher Gleason score and PSA, and better response to ADT were observed in patients with high AutS. Meanwhile, we found that high AutS PCa was related to more proliferation-associated signaling activation and higher genetic mutation frequencies, manifesting a poor prognosis. A nomogram was constructed based on GS, T stage, PSA, and AutS as covariates. Its discriminative efficacy and clinical value were validated using robust statistical methods. Finally, we tested its prognostic value through two external cohorts and six published signatures.  Conclusion:   The autophagy-related gene signature is a highly discriminative model for risk stratification and drug therapy in PCa, and a nomogram incorporating AutS might be a promising tool for precision medicine.""","""['Chenghao Wen', 'Qintao Ge', 'Bangshun Dai', 'Jiawei Li', 'Feixiang Yang', 'Jialin Meng', 'Shenglin Gao', 'Song Fan', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['Autophagy-related circRNA evaluation reveals hsa_circ_0001747 as a potential favorable prognostic factor for biochemical recurrence in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Nomogram based on autophagy related genes for predicting the survival in melanoma.', 'Development of an autophagy-related gene expression signature for prognosis prediction in prostate cancer patients.', 'Gene signatures predict biochemical recurrence-free survival in primary prostate cancer patients after radical therapy.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Diverse roles of UBE2T in cancer (Review).', 'MRI-measured adipose features as predictive factors for detection of prostate cancer in males undergoing systematic prostate biopsy: a retrospective study based on a Chinese population.']"""

This study researched the influence of ferroptosis on gene mutations, various cellular signaling pathways, biochemical recurrence (BCR), and drug resistance in both FPI-high and FPI-low groups. Methods: RNA-seq, somatic mutation data, and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). FPI values were calculated. All samples were divided into FPI-high and FPI-low groups. The BCR-free survival rate, tumor mutation burden (TMB) value, cellular signaling pathway, differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and drug resistance in the two FPI groups were identified. Human PCa cells, LNCaP, were treated with ferroptosis inducer erastin or inhibitor ferrostatin-1. The expression of hub genes was detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Results: A high FPI level was significantly related to poor BCR-free survival. Also, higher TMB value was found in the FPI-high group, and FPI was shown to be associated with gene mutations. Then, genes in both groups were revealed to be enriched in different pathways. A total of 310 DEGs were identified to be involved in muscle system processes and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. A total of 101 genes were found to be related to BCR-free survival, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Two sub-modules were identified by MCODE, and eight hub genes were screened out, among which SYT4 had higher expression levels and poorer BCR-free survival in the FPI-high group, while the remaining hub genes had lower expression levels and poorer BCR-free survival. Drug sensitivity was revealed to be different in the two groups by study on the IC50 data of different molecules and ferroptosis regulator gene (FRG) expressions. Finally, erastin increased the expression of SYT4 in LNCaP and decreased the expression of the other four genes (ACTC1, ACTA1, ACTN2, and MYH6), while ferrostatin-1 led to the opposite results. The molecular experimental results were consistent with those of bioinformatics analysis, except TNNI1, TNNC2, and NRAP. Conclusion: The current research depicted the ferroptosis level and FRGs in PCa. Ferroptosis was related to TMB value, BCR-free survival, and drug resistance.

Design:   Delphi study consisting of two rounds of online questionnaires, two virtual advisory board meetings and a final online questionnaire.  Setting:   Radical radiation therapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer in the UK.  Participants:   Six leading clinical oncologists and one urologist from across the UK.  Interventions:   Rectal hydrogel spacer.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   None reported.  Results:   The panel reached consensus on the importance of minimising toxicity for treatments with curative intent and that even low-grade toxicity-related adverse events can significantly impact quality of life. There was agreement that despite meeting rectal dose constraints, too many patients experience rectal toxicity and that rectal hydrogel spacers in eligible patients significantly reduces toxicity-related adverse events. However, as a consequence of funding limitations, patients need to be prioritised for spacer use. A higher benefit of spacers can be expected in patients on anticoagulation and in patients with diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease, but consensus could not be reached regarding patient groups expected to benefit less. While radiation therapy regimen is not a main factor determining prioritisation, higher benefit is expected in ultrahypofractionated regimens.  Conclusion:   There is a strong and general agreement that all patients with prostate cancer undergoing radical radiation therapy have the potential to benefit from hydrogel spacers. Currently, not all patients who could potentially benefit can access hydrogel spacers, and access is unequal.

Our analysis on different patient cohorts suggests that NRP2 is high in NE-like PCa. We have developed cell line models to investigate NRP2's role in NE-like PCa. Our bioinformatics, mass spectrometry, cytokine array, and other supporting experiments reveal that NRP2 regulates robust secretory phenotype in NE-like PCa and controls the secretion of factors promoting cancer cell survival.

Low incidence of cancer in those with SMI has been attributed to premature mortality, though evidence for this is lacking. We aimed to investigate the relationship between SMI and cancer incidence and mortality, and to assess the effect of premature mortality on cancer incidence rates.  Methods:   In this UK-wide matched cohort study using primary care records we calculated incidence and mortality rates of all-cancer, and bowel, lung, breast or prostate cancer, in patients with SMI, compared to matched patients without SMI. We used competing risks regression to account for mortality from other causes.  Findings:   69,632 patients had an SMI diagnosis. The rate of all-cancer diagnoses was reduced in those with SMI (Hazard ratio (HR):0Â·95; 95%CI 0Â·93-0Â·98) compared to those without SMI, and particularly in those with schizophrenia (HR:0Â·82; 95%CI 0Â·77-0Â·88) compared to those without SMI. When accounting for the competing risk of premature mortality, incidence remained lower only in patients with schizophrenia. All-cause mortality after cancer was increased in the SMI group, and cancer-specific mortality was increased in those with schizophrenia (hazard ratio: 1.96; 95%CI 1.57-2.44).  Interpretation:   Patients with schizophrenia have lower rates of cancer diagnosis but higher all-cause and cancer-specific mortality rates following diagnosis compared to those without SMI.

The present study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of cirsilineol against the human DU-145 prostate cancer cells. The results showed that cirsilineol suppressed the proliferation of DU-145 cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner with minimal cytotoxic effects against the normal cells. The IC50 of cirsilineol was found to be 7 Î¼M and 110 Î¼M against prostate cancer DU-145 and normal HPrEC prostate cells, respectively. Acridine orange and ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining showed that cirsilineol induced apoptosis in DU-145 prostate cancer cells. The Annexin V/PI staining further confirmed the induction of apoptosis in DU-145 cells. The western blot analysis showed that cirsilineol suppressed the expression of Bax and upregulated the expression of Bcl-2 in prostate cancer DU-145 cells. Moreover, cirsilineol caused a dose-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in prostate cancer. Wound healing and Transwell assays showed that cirsilineol inhibits migration and invasion of DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Summing up, the results suggest that cirsilineol suppresses the proliferation of prostate cancer cells and may prove to be a beneficial lead molecule for the development of chemotherapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Shadma Wahab', 'Abdulrhman Alsayari', 'Abdullatif Bin Muhsinah', 'Irfan Ahmad', 'Md Sarfaraj Hussain', 'Jewel Mallick']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Evid Based Complement Alternat Med""","""['Cirsilineol inhibits proliferation of lung squamous cell carcinoma by inducing ROS mediated apoptosis.', 'Antiproliferative activities of auraptenol against drug-resistant human prostate carcinoma cells are mediated via programmed cell death, endogenous ROS production, and targeting the JNK/p38 MAPK signal pathways.', 'Evodiamine exerts anticancer effects via induction of apoptosis and autophagy and suppresses the migration and invasion of human colon cancer cells.', 'Detailed studies on the anticancer action of rosmarinic acid in human Hep-G2 liver carcinoma cells: evaluating its effects on cellular apoptosis, caspase activation and suppression of cell migration and invasion.', 'Ambrosin sesquiterpene lactone exerts selective and potent anticancer effects in drug-resistant human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) through mitochondrial mediated apoptosis, ROS generation and targeting Akt/Î²-Catenin signaling pathway.', 'Nanomaterials-Based Novel Immune Strategies in Clinical Translation for Cancer Therapy.']"""

Methods:   The costs of protocol biopsies performed in the first year of surveillance (between January 2010 and June 2020) and those of brachytherapy and radiation therapy performed between May 2019 and June 2020 at the Kagawa University Hospital were analyzed. Hormone therapy costs were assumed to be the costs of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogs for over 5 years. Active surveillance-eligible patients were defined based on the following: age <74 years, â¤T2, Gleason score â¤6, prostate-specific antigen level â¤10 ng/ml, and 1-2 positive cores. We estimated the total number of active surveillance-eligible patients in Japan based on the Japan Study Group of Prostate Cancer (J-CAP) study and the 2017 cancer statistical data. We then calculated the 5-year treatment costs of active surveillance-eligible patients using the J-CAP and PRIAS-JAPAN study data.  Results:   In 2017, number of active surveillance-eligible patients in Japan was estimated to be 2808. The 5-year total costs of surveillance, prostatectomy, brachytherapy, radiation therapy, and hormone therapy were 1.65, 14.0, 4.61, 4.04, and 5.87 million United States dollar (USD), respectively. If 50% and 100% of the patients in each treatment group had opted for active surveillance as the initial treatment, the total treatment cost would have been reduced by USD 6.89 million (JPY 889 million) and USD 13.8 million (JPY 1.78 billion), respectively.

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of escalating the dose to 82 Gy following insertion of a peri-rectal hydrogel spacer (HS) prior to radiotherapy.  Methods:   This was a single arm, open-label, prospective study of men with localised prostate cancer who were prescribed a course of intensity modulated radiotherapy escalated to 82 Gy in 2 Gy fractions following insertion of the SpaceOARâ¢ HS (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA). Patients were prescribed a standard course of 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions where rectal dose constraints could not be met for the 82 Gy plan. The co-primary endpoints were the rate of grade 3 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) adverse events (CTCAE, v4), and patient-reported quality of life (QoL) (EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR25 modules), up to 37.5 months post-treatment.  Results:   Seventy patients received treatment on the study, with 64 (91.4%) receiving an 82 Gy treatment course. The median follow-up time post-treatment was 37.4 months. The rate of radiotherapy-related grade 3 GI and GU adverse events was 0% and 2.9%, respectively. There were 2 (2.9%) grade 3 adverse events related to insertion of the HS. Only small and transient declines in QoL were observed; there was no clinically or statistically significant decline in QoL beyond 13.5 months and up to 37.5 months post-treatment, compared to baseline. No late RTOG-defined grade â¥ 2 GI toxicity was observed, with no GI toxicity observed in any patient at 37.5 months post-treatment.

However, the traditional experiment methods are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, it is a challenging task that how to develop more accurate and efficient methods for predicting potential associations between miRNA and disease.  Results:   In the study, we developed a computational model that combined heterogeneous graph convolutional network with enhanced layer for miRNA-disease association prediction (HGCNELMDA). The major improvement of our method lies in through restarting the random walk optimized the original features of nodes and adding a reinforcement layer to the hidden layer of graph convolutional network retained similar information between nodes in the feature space. In addition, the proposed approach recalculated the influence of neighborhood nodes on target nodes by introducing the attention mechanism. The reliable performance of the HGCNELMDA was certified by the AUC of 93.47% in global leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), and the average AUCs of 93.01% in fivefold cross-validation. Meanwhile, we compared the HGCNELMDA with the stateâofâtheâart methods. Comparative results indicated that o the HGCNELMDA is very promising and may provide a costâeffective alternative for miRNA-disease association prediction. Moreover, we applied HGCNELMDA to 3 different case studies to predict potential miRNAs related to lung cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Results showed that 48, 50, and 50 of the top 50 predicted miRNAs were supported by experimental association evidence. Therefore, the HGCNELMDA is a reliable method for predicting disease-related miRNAs.  Conclusions:   The results of the HGCNELMDA method in the LOOCV (leave-one-out cross validation, LOOCV) and 5-cross validations were 93.47% and 93.01%, respectively. Compared with other typical methods, the performance of HGCNELMDA is higher. Three cases of lung cancer, prostate cancer, and pancreatic cancer were studied. Among the predicted top 50 candidate miRNAs, 48, 50, and 50 were verified in the biological database HDMMV2.0. Therefore; this further confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of our method. Therefore, this further confirms the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion:   This study described how companionship, social influence, instrumental support, informational support and validation were perceived to impact the health behaviours of people LWBC during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions for people LWBC could recommend co-participation in exercise with friends and family; promote the formation of collaborative implementation intentions with family to reduce alcohol consumption; and encourage supportive communication between partners about health behaviours.

Information about functional urological long-term outcomes is rare.  Methods:   Data of all patients who had undergone bladder-preserving surgery with or without brachytherapy at our institution between 2009 and 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Detailed urological function was assessed focusing on age-related continence, bladder capacity and urodynamic findings.  Results:   We identified 40 patients, median age at surgery of 27 months (range 9-191), and 32 patients additionally received postoperative high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The median follow-up was 32.5 months (range 6-125). The bladder capacity increased from median 66.7% (21.1-180) of expected bladder capacity related to age 3 months after surgery to 87.4% (58.1-181.8) 9 months after surgery. In the group of aged > 6-year-old, continence was 94% (83% with brachytherapy, 100% without brachytherapy). Erectile function was normal in 92% (90% with brachytherapy, 100% without brachytherapy). Bladder capacity was more than 65% expected bladder capacity related to age in 70% (60% with brachytherapy, 86% without brachytherapy). 65% of all patients need neither anticholinergic drugs nor low-dose antibiotics (63% with brachytherapy, 71% without brachytherapy).  Conclusions:   Bladder preservation with good functional outcome can be achieved in localized bladder/prostate-rhabdomyosarcoma.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioguided surgery (RGS) could identify lymph node invasion (LNI) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).  Objective:   To report the planned interim analyses of a phase 2 prospective study (NCT04832958) aimed at describing PSMA-RGS during RARP.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase 2 trial aimed at enrolling 100 patients with intermediate- or high-risk cN0cM0 PCa at conventional imaging with a risk of LNI of >5% was conducted. Overall, 18 patients were enrolled between June 2021 and March 2022. Among them, 12 patients underwent PSMA-RGS and represented the study cohort.  Surgical procedure:   All patients received 68Ga-PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging; 99mTc-PSMA-I&S was synthesised and administered intravenously the day before surgery, followed by single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography. A Drop-In gamma probe was used for in vivo measurements. All positive lesions (count rate â¥2 compared with background) were excised and ePLND was performed.  Measurements:   Side effects, perioperative outcomes, and performance characteristics of robot-assisted PSMA-RGS for LNI were measured.  Results and limitations:   Overall, four (33%), six (50%), and two (17%) patients had intermediate-risk, high-risk, and locally advanced PCa. Overall, two (17%) patients had pathologic nodal uptake at PSMA PET. The median operative time, blood loss, and length of stay were 230 min, 100 ml, and 5 d, respectively. No adverse events and intraoperative complications were recorded. One patient experienced a 30-d complication (Clavien-Dindo 2; 8.3%). Overall, three (25%) patients had LNI at ePLND. At per-region analyses on 96 nodal areas, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of PSMA-RGS were 63%, 99%, 83%, and 96%, respectively. On a per-patient level, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive values of PSMA-RGS were 67%, 100%, 100%, and 90%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Robot-assisted PSMA-RGS in primary staging is a safe and feasible procedure characterised by acceptable specificity but suboptimal sensitivity, missing micrometastatic nodal disease.

We aimed to determine the safety of neoadjuvant stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) before RP in this population.  Methods and patients:   A single-institution phase 1 trial (NCT02946008) of men with high-risk or node-positive prostate cancer were enrolled between March and October 2017. The primary endpoint was to determine the maximum tolerated dose of SBRT based on a composite 30-day post-RP toxicity goal of â¤28% of patients experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Secondary outcomes included toxicity, efficacy, and multiple quality of life (QoL) inventories. SBRT (30-35 Gy/5 fractions) was delivered to the prostate and seminal vesicles, and 25 Gy/5 fractions to the pelvic lymph nodes. RP was performed for a median of 6 weeks post-SBRT. Hormone therapy was not allowed.  Results:   Median follow-up was 40 months (range, 33-44). Twenty-five percent of the patients (n = 4) experienced a DLT within 30 days post-RP; however, the trial was stopped early (n = 16 of planned 38 patients) owing to the proportion and severity of the late adverse events. Post-RP grade 3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities occurred in 75% (n = 12) and 25% (n = 4) of patients, respectively. Two patients required cystectomy and urinary diversion â¥2 years post-RP. At 24 months post-RP, 75% (n = 12) of men used â¥1 pad/d and 0% had erections suitable for intercourse. Surgical margins were negative in all patients and 31% (n = 5) had complete or partial (pre-RP) MRI-response to SBRT. Three-year biochemical recurrence and distant metastasis were 45% (95% CI, 5%-68%) and 28% (95% CI, 0%-49%), respectively.

Recognition of tumor by T cells is mediated by interaction between peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) and T cell receptors (TCRs). Revealing the identity of peptides bound to MHC is critical in discovering cognate TCRs and predicting potential toxicity. We performed multimodal immunopeptidomic analyses for human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), a well-recognized tissue antigen. Three physical methods, including mild acid elution, coimmunoprecipitation, and secreted MHC precipitation, were used to capture a thorough signature of PAP on HLA-A*02:01. Eleven PAP peptides that are potentially A*02:01-restricted were identified, including five predicted strong binders by NetMHCpan 4.0. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from more than 20 healthy donors were screened with the PAP peptides. Seven cognate TCRs were isolated which can recognize three distinct epitopes when expressed in PBMCs. One TCR shows reactivity toward cell lines expressing both full-length PAP and HLA-A*02:01.

Methods:   Participants included 215,102 adults in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study followed between 2004 and 2011 (mean 7.0 person-years). Scores (range: 0-7 points) were calculated from self-reported weight, physical activity, and diet and alcohol intake measures. Outcomes included 17 cancers reviewed by WCRF/AICR (cases: male n = 11,066; female n = 8,865) and top three U.S. cancers in males (total n = 4,658; lung n = 2,211; prostate n = 920; colorectal n = 1,527) and females (total n = 5,957; lung n = 1,475; post-menopausal breast n = 3,546; colorectal n = 936). Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for score and cancer risk associations, stratifying by sex and smoking status.  Results:   Each one-point score increase was associated with 6% to 13% reduced cancer risk across combined outcomes, except for male never smokers' risk for top three cancers and male current smokers' risk for both combined cancer outcomes. Higher scores were associated with decreased lung cancer risk only among male former smokers (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.89) and female current smokers (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.96). Higher scores were associated with 7% to 19% decreased breast cancer risk across smoking strata and 10% to 14% decreased colorectal cancer risk among male and female never and former smokers.

To further increase the biomass and the biotechnological potential of this strain in these conditions, mixotrophic growth (i.e., the simultaneous use of photosynthesis and respiration) with glycerol as an external carbon source was investigated in this study and compared with phototrophic growth that made use of air enriched with 1-2% CO2. The addition of either glycerol or CO2-enriched air stimulated the growth of Ng and theproduction of high-value long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (EPA) as well as the carotenoid canthaxanthin. Bioassays in human prostate cell lines indicated the highest antitumoral activity for Ng extracts and fractions from mixotrophic conditions. Metabolomics detected betaine lipids specifically in the bioactive fractions, suggesting their involvement in the observed antitumoral effect. Genes related to autophagy were found to be upregulated by the most bioactive fraction, suggesting a possible therapeutic target against prostate cancer progression.

Methods:   A total of 490 patients who underwent prostate biopsy for PSA 4-10 ng ml-1 were enrolled and randomly divided into a pilot cohort (70%) and a validation cohort (30%). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to select potential predictors of PCa and csPCa, and a nomogram was created. The area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was calculated, and compared using DeLong's test. The diagnostic performance and unnecessary biopsy rate of the nomogram prediction model were also assessed. Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was employed to test for model fitness.  Results:   The multivariate analysis revealed that features independently associated with PCa and csPCa were age, PI-RADS score and CEUS manifestations. Incorporating these factors, the nomogram achieved good discrimination performance of AUC 0.843 for PCa, 0.876 for csPCa in the pilot cohort, and 0.818 for PCa, 0.857 for csPCa in the validation cohort, respectively, and had well-fitted calibration curves. And the diagnostic performance of the nomogram was comparable to the model including all the parameters (p > 0.05). Besides, the nomogram prediction model yielded meaningful reduction in unnecessary biopsy rate (from 74.8 to 21.1% in PCa, and from 83.7 to 5.4% in csPCa).  Conclusions:   The nomogram prediction model based on age, PI-RADS v2.1 and CEUS achieved an optimal prediction of PCa and csPCa. Using this model, the PCa risk for an individual patient can be estimated, which can lead to a rational biopsy choice.

This is relevant because low- and high-volume metastatic disease are associated with different outcomes, and thus management of the two forms should differ. Although some definitions have been reported, the concept of oligometastatic disease is not so clearly defined, giving rise to further variability in the choice of treatment, mainly between systemic agents and radiotherapy, especially in the era of metastasis-directed therapy. With the aim of providing clinicians with guidance on best practice, a group of medical and radiation oncologists, experts in prostate cancer, used the round robin method to generate a series of consensus statements on management of low-volume mHSPC. Consensus was obtained on three major areas of controversy: (1) with regard to clinical definitions of mHSPC, it was held that oligometastatic and low-volume disease refer to different concepts and should not be used interchangeably; (2) regarding therapy of de novo low-volume metastatic disease, androgen deprivation therapy alone can be considered undertreatment, and all patients should be evaluated for systemic treatment combinations; local therapy should not be denied in patients with mHSPC, regardless of the intensity of systemic therapy, and metastasis-directed therapy can be proposed in selected cases; (3) with regard to treatment of metachronous metastatic disease, patients should be evaluated for systemic treatment combinations. Metastasis-directed therapy can be proposed to delay systemic treatment in selected cases, especially if prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography staging has been performed and when indolent disease occurs. It is hoped that clinicians treating patients with mHSPC in daily practice will find this expert opinion of value.""","""['Elena Verzoni', 'Giovanni Pappagallo', 'Filippo Alongi', 'Stefano Arcangeli', 'Giulio Francolini', 'Daniele Galanti', 'Luca Galli', 'Marco Maruzzo', 'Sabrina Rossetti', 'Giambattista Siepe', 'Luca Triggiani', 'Paolo Andrea Zucali', ""Rolando Maria D'Angelillo""]""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['Management of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC): an Evolving Treatment Paradigm.', 'Management of patients with advanced prostate cancer-metastatic and/or castration-resistant prostate cancer: Report of the Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2022.', 'Time of metastatic disease presentation and volume of disease are prognostic for metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC).', 'Management of newly diagnosed metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A survey of UK Uro-oncologists.', 'Health Care Delivery for Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Across the Globe.', 'The diagnosis and treatment of castrate-sensitive oligometastatic prostate cancer: A review.']"""

Methods:   Standard of care (SOC) was androgen deprivation therapy with or without radical prostate radiotherapy. A total of 460 SOC and 230 SOC plus docetaxel were randomly assigned 2:1. Standard survival methods and intention to treat were used. Treatment effect estimates were summarized from adjusted Cox regression models, switching to restricted mean survival time if non-proportional hazards. mPFS (new metastases, skeletal-related events, or prostate cancer death) had 70% power (Î± = 0.05) for a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.70.

Methods:   From January 2019 to March 2021 969 Patients after a MRI/TRUS TPBx were evaluated separately for target biopsies (TB) and systematic biopsies regarding PCa detection and PCa risk evaluation. Needle tracking in the axial sequences of multiparametric MRI was used to assess the localisation of the detected PCa in the biopsy cores related to the reported PI-RADS lesions.  Results:   The overall cancer detection rate (CDR) for PCa and clinically significant (cs) PCa (ISUP â¥2) with the combination of TB and SB were 66 and 49%. TB detected 46% csPCa and SB 22% csPCa. SB identified 1.5% additional csPCa outside of the reported PI-RADS lesions. 16 patients (1.7%) showed a relevant upgrading from clinically insignificant PCa in TB to csPCa. In 736 patients with unilateral suspicious lesions on MRI, 145 patients (20%) were detected with contralateral PCa-positive SB. 238 patients (25%) showed PCa positive systematic biopsy cores outside of the described PI-RADS lesions.  Conclusions:   Needle tracking optimizes the 3D-localisation of cancer in the prostate. Our results show that the added value of SB with a reduced systematic biopsy scheme is low with regard to prostate cancer (PCa) detection and PCa risk evaluation.

It is known that invasion of pelvic lymph nodes is associated with worse oncological outcome, but little is known about invasion of preprostatic lymph nodes. We hypothesized that positive preprostatic lymph nodes may not be as harmful as positive pelvic lymph nodes.  Materials and methods:   A total of 11,107 consecutive patients treated for prostate cancer with radical prostatectomy between 2013 and 2017 were evaluated. 1575 (14.2%) had some type of lymph node invasion, 53 (0.5%) had only one positive preprostatic lymph node and 705 (6.3%) had only one positive pelvic lymph node.  Results:   Median follow-up was 37.7 months (interquartile range: 24.6-58.7 months). Baseline characteristics of the overall cohort were not statistically significant between the preprostatic vs. pelvic lymph node invasion groups, except for robot-assisted operation (64.2 vs. 32.3%, p < 0.001) and count of removed lymph nodes (16 vs. 19, p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in 3-years biochemical recurrence rate (56.2 vs. 65.8%, p = 0.5), 3-years metastases free survival rate (87.4 vs. 95.5%, p = 0.5) and overall cancer-specific mortality (1.9 vs 1.0%) between the two groups.  Conclusions:   Preprostatic lymph node invasion seems to have a similar harmful effect as pelvic lymph node invasion and thus, if detected, may alter treatment and follow-up strategy. Therefore, it is important to perform a histological analysis when removing the preprostatic tissue.""","""['Michael Korten#', 'Randi M Pose#', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Uwe Michl', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Burkhard Beyer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""[""Effect of Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection on Oncologic Outcomes in Patients with D'Amico Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer Treated with Radical Prostatectomy: A Multi-Institutional Study."", 'Standardized comparison of robot-assisted limited and extended pelvic lymphadenectomy for prostate cancer.', 'Targeted salvage lymphadenectomy in patients treated with radical prostatectomy with biochemical recurrence: complete biochemical response without adjuvant therapy in patients with low volume lymph node recurrence over a long-term follow-up.', 'Indications for pelvic lymphadenectomy in clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Anatomical extent of pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.']"""

In this study we analysed an international multi-institutional series of 49 patients with prostatic MP to more clearly define its clinicopathological features. The median age was 67 years and the median serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.5 ng/ml. MP was clinically manifest in most cases (28 of 45 patients with data available, 62%). Of 43 patients with detailed clinical history available, 21 (49%) had concurrent or metachronous malignancies (including prostate cancer). Diabetes or insulin resistance was present in 11 patients (26%). Additionally, three patients had a history of solid organ transplantation and one had HIV. Of note, six of 34 patients (18%) without concurrent prostate cancer had an abnormal digital rectal examination and/or lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with prostate imaging reporting and data system (PIRADS) scores 4-5. The initial diagnosis was made on core biopsies (25 of 49, 51%), transurethal resection specimens (12 of 49, 24%), radical prostatectomies (10 of 49, 20%), Holmium-laser enucleation (one of 49, 2%) and cystoprostatectomy (one of 49, 2%). Tissue involvement was more commonly diffuse or multifocal (40 of 49, 82%). Von Kossa and periodic acid-Schiff stains were positive in 35 of 38 (92%) and 26 of 27 lesions (96%), respectively. Of note, two cases were received in consultation by the authors with a preliminary diagnosis of mesenchymal tumour/tumour of the specialised prostatic stroma.

However, if LINC00839 has roles in colorectal cancer (CRC), it has not been elucidated so far. Here, we focus on the biological role and involved mechanisms of LINC00839 in CRC. We show that LINC00839 is selectively upregulated in CRC and locates to the nucleus. High expression of LINC00839 is associated with poor outcomes in CRC patients. Functional experiments show that LINC00839 promotes CRC proliferation, invasion, and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00839 recruits Ruvb1 to the Tip60 complex and increases its acetylase activity. LINC00839 guides the complex to the NRF1 promoter and promotes acetylation of lysines 5 and 8 of histones H4, thereby upregulating the expression of NRF1. Subsequently, NRF1 activates mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, thereby promoting CRC progression. In summary, our study reports on a mechanism by which LINC00839 positively regulates NRF1, thus promoting mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis, as well as CRC progression.""","""['Xiaoting Liu', 'Jianxiong Chen', 'Sijing Zhang', 'Xunhua Liu', 'Xiaoli Long', 'Jiawen Lan', 'Miao Zhou', 'Lin Zheng', 'Jun Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""EMBO Rep""","""['Nrf1-mediated transcriptional regulation of the proteasome requires a functional TIP60 complex.', 'CircMYO10 promotes osteosarcoma progression by regulating miR-370-3p/RUVBL1 axis to enhance the transcriptional activity of Î²-catenin/LEF1 complex via effects on chromatin remodeling.', 'RUVBL1 is an amplified epigenetic factor promoting proliferation and inhibiting differentiation program in head and neck squamous cancers.', 'LINC00839 promotes malignancy of liver cancer via binding FMNL2 under hypoxia.', 'PRMT5-Dependent Methylation of the TIP60 Coactivator RUVBL1 Is a Key Regulator of Homologous Recombination.', 'Mutual Regulation of ncRNAs and Chromatin Remodeling Complexes in Normal and Pathological Conditions.', 'The chromatin-associated RNAs in gene regulation and cancer.', 'Association of mitochondrial homeostasis and dynamic balance with malignant biological behaviors of gastrointestinal cancer.', 'Decoding Roles of Exosomal lncRNAs in Tumor-Immune Regulation and Therapeutic Potential.']"""

An analogous evaluation across Canadian provinces has yet to be conducted.  Data and methods:   Data from 1992 to 2017 are from the population-based Canadian Cancer Registry death-linked analytic file. Provincial cancer survival index (CSI) estimates were calculated as the weighted sum of the sex- and cancer-specific age-standardized provincial net survival estimates. Provincial sex-specific CSI estimates were calculated separately using sex-specific cancer type weights. Data availability (Quebec) and sufficiency (Prince Edward Island and the territories) issues precluded CSI calculations for all jurisdictions.  Results:   For the most recent period, 2013 to 2017, the five-year CSI was highest in Ontario (64.1%) and Alberta (63.3%), and lowest in Nova Scotia (60.8%). Significant progress in the five-year CSI since the period from 1992 to 1996 was observed in each province; the largest increases occurred in Alberta (8.7 percentage points) and Ontario (8.6 percentage points). Alberta's increase improved its relative provincial ranking from eighth to second. The influence of prostate cancer on provincial changes in the CSI since the period from 2003 to 2007 varied considerably from strongly counterproductive in New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia because of decreasing prostate cancer survival, to strongly productive in Manitoba.  Interpretation:   Significant progress has been made in five-year cancer survival for all cancers combined since the early 1990s in each Canadian province studied. However, the magnitude of the progress has not been uniform across the provinces, and the cancer and sex combinations that have most influenced it have varied by province and period.""","""['Larry F Ellison']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Health Rep""","""['The cancer survival index: Measuring progress in cancer survival to help evaluate cancer control efforts in Canada.', 'Measuring Substance-Related Disorders Using Canadian Administrative Health Databanks: Interprovincial Comparisons of Recorded Diagnostic Rates, Incidence Proportions and Mortality Rate Ratios.', 'Secondary prevention after acute myocardial infarction in four Canadian provinces, 1997-2000.', 'A scorecard for osteoporosis in Canada and seven Canadian provinces.', ""Has Radiotherapy Been Successfully Implemented in Alberta's Small Cities?

OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion of patients initiating oral anticancer therapy who were adherent to OAMs and to identify significant predictors of adherence to OAMs, including patient OOP costs and patient demographics. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from Optum Clinformatics Data Mart commercial claims database for 2010-2018. Patients with a new pharmacy claim for an OAM between July 1, 2010, and December 31, 2017, were followed for 6 months to ascertain their medication adherence, which was defined as a proportion of days covered value of at least 0.8. Average monthly patient OOP costs for OAM prescriptions were categorized as lower OOP costs (quartiles 1-3) and higher OOP costs (quartile 4). Separate multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify predictors of OAM nonadherence for each cancer type. RESULTS: Out of 37,938 patients with cancer, 51.9% were adherent to OAMs, with adherence ranging from 32.8% among those with liver cancer to 70.4% among those with brain tumor. The average monthly OOP costs of OAMs also differed by cancer type, ranging from $749 (SD = $1,014) among patients with blood cancer to $106 (SD = $439) among those with prostate cancer. Higher patient OOP costs were associated with higher odds of OAM nonadherence for many cancer types, including renal cancer (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.91; 95% CI = 2.80-5.47) and breast cancer (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.13-1.41). Additionally, patients with inpatient hospitalizations during the 6 months following OAM initiation had significantly higher odds of OAM nonadherence for all cancer types except for stomach cancer. Among patients with stomach cancer, male sex was associated with lower odds of OAM nonadherence (AOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.37-0.97). Among patients with renal or stomach cancer, those who had Medicare low-income subsidy had higher odds of OAM nonadherence compared with those with commercial insurance coverage. Among patients with blood cancers, Black and Hispanic patients had higher odds of OAM nonadherence compared with White patients (AOR = 1.48; 95% CI = 1.25-1.75 and AOR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.13-1.68, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Overall adherence to OAMs was suboptimal, and for several cancer types, adherence was worse among patients with higher OOP costs, those who were hospitalized, and those who received Medicare low-income subsidy. Policies addressing cost and access to OAMs and health-system strategies to address barriers to the effective use of OAMs are needed to improve patient access to these vital medications.

Biomarkers may be able to elucidate this role. Our objectives were to characterize profiles of arsenic species and metallome in toenails and urine samples, compare profiles between prostate cancer cases and controls, and determine the discriminant ability of toenail and urine biomarkers. Toenail samples (n = 576), urine samples (n = 152), and questionnaire data were sourced from the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (PATH) cohort study. Healthy controls were matched to prostate cancer cases (3:1 ratio) on sex, age, smoking status, and the province of residence. Metallome profiles and proportions of arsenic species were measured in toenail and urine samples. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare the mean percent monomethylarsonic acid (%MMA), dimethylarsonic acid (%DMA), inorganic arsenic (%iAs), primary methylation index (PMI, MMA/iAs), and secondary methylation index (SMI, DMA/MMA). Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was used to compare selected metal concentrations. Mean %MMA was significantly lower and SMI was significantly higher in toenails from prostate cancer cases compared to controls in unadjusted and adjusted models. Proportions of arsenic species were correlated with total arsenic in toenails. Arsenic speciation in urine was not different between cases and controls, nor were metallome profiles in toenails and urine.

Previously, SP-D expression was found to be significantly downregulated at the malignant sites of human prostate adenocarcinoma and associated with an increasing Gleason score and severity. We recently reported selective induction of intrinsic apoptosis by a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) in the human Prostate cancer (PCa) biopsy explants and cells with glucose regulated protein of 78 (GRP78) as one of the key interacting partners. The present study evaluated the expression of SP-D in early and advanced stages of PCa using transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Both early and late stages of PCa showed significantly decreased SP-D mRNA expression and increased proteolytic degradation of SP-D protein. Systemic and tumoural immunophenotyping of TRAMP model revealed increased serine proteases producing granulocytes and polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN MDSCs) in the late stage; the serine proteases secreted by these cells could be involved in the degradation of SP-D. Susceptibility of rfhSP-D to elastase-mediated proteolysis provided the rationale to use an elastase-inhibitor to sustain intact rfhSP-D in the tumour microenvironment. The study revealed an immunomodulatory potential of rfhSP-D and elastase inhibitor, sivelestat, to induce macrophage polarization towards M1 with downregulation of PMN MDSCs in ex-vivo cultured TRAMP tumours. Furthermore, rfhSP-D induced immunogenic cell death in murine PCa cells and in TRAMP explants. The findings highlight that SP-D plays an anti-tumourigenic role in PCa by inducing immunogenic cell death and immunomodulation while the prostate tumour milieu adversely impacts SP-D by inhibiting its transcription, and enhancing its proteolytic degradation.

In this study, we describe agreement and concordance with the recommendations from front-line oncologists across SSA.  Methods:   An electronic survey was distributed to members of the African Organization for Research & Training in Cancer (AORTIC) and oncology groups within SSA using a hierarchical snowball method; each primary contact distributed the survey through their personal networks. The survey captured information about awareness of the CWA list, agreement with recommendations, and concordance with clinical practice. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize study results.  Results:   52 individuals responded to the survey; 64% (33/52) were female and 58% (30/52) were clinical oncologists. Respondents represented 15 countries in SSA; 69% (36/52) practiced exclusively in the public system.

There was generally a high agreement with the recommendations (range 84-98%); the highest agreement was related to staging/defining treatment intent (98%). The proportion of oncologists who implemented these recommendations in routine practice was somewhat lower (range 68-100%). Lowest rates of concordance related to: the use of shorter schedules of radiotherapy (67%); discussion of active surveillance forlow-risk prostate cancer (67%); only performing breast surgery for a mass that was proven to be malignant (70%); and seeking multidisciplinary input for curative intent treatment plans (73%).

We investigated the impact of acute exposure of normal immortalised prostate cells (RWPE-1) to NO on cell proliferation and activation of DNA damage repair pathways. Furthermore we investigated the long term effects of chronic NO exposure on RWPE-1 cell migration and invasion potential and hallmarks of transformation. Our results demonstrate that NO induces DNA damage as indicated by Î³H2AX foci and p53 activation resulting in a G1/S phase block and activation of 53BP1 DNA damage repair protein. Long term adaption to NO results in increased migration and invasion potential, acquisition of anchorage independent growth and increased resistance to chemotherapy. This was recapitulated in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells which upon chronic exposure to NO displayed increased cell migration, colony formation and increased resistance to chemotherapeutics.

Next generation sequencing-based clinical assays, designed to detect relevant gene fusions, mutations, and copy number changes, were performed on 750 melanomas (375 primary and 375 metastases) at our institution from 2014-2021. These included 599 (80%) cutaneous, 38 (5%) acral, 11 (1.5%) anorectal, 23 (3%) sinonasal, 27 (3.6%) eye (uveal/ conjunctiva), 11 (1.5%) genital (vulva/penile), and 41 (5.5%) melanomas of unknown primary. Sixteen fusions (2%) were detected in samples from 16 patients: 12/599 (2%) cutaneous, 2/38 (5%) acral, 1/9 (11%) vulva, 1/23(4.3%) sinonasal; and 12/16 (75%) fusions were potentially targetable. We identified two novel rearrangements: NAGS::MAST2 and NOTCH1::GNB1; and two fusions that have been reported in other malignancies but not in melanoma: CANT1::ETV4 (prostate cancer) and CCDC6::RET (thyroid cancer). Additional fusions, previously reported in melanoma, included: EML4::ALK, MLPH::ALK, AGAP3::BRAF, AGK::BRAF, CDH3::BRAF, CCT8::BRAF, DIP2B::BRAF, EFNB1::RAF1, LRCH3::RAF1, MAP4::RAF1, RUFY1::RAF1, and ADCY2::TERT. Fusion positive melanomas harbored recurrent alterations in TERT and CDKN2A, among others. Gene fusions were exceedingly rare (0.2%) in BRAF/RAS/NF1-mutant tumors and were detected in 5.6% of triple wild-type melanomas. Interestingly, gene rearrangements were significantly enriched within the subset of triple wild-type melanomas that harbor TERT promoter mutations (18% versus 2%, p < 0.0001). Thirteen (81%) patients were treated with immunotherapy for metastatic disease or in the adjuvant setting. Six of 12 (50%) patients with potentially actionable fusions progressed on immunotherapy, and 3/6 (50%) were treated with targeted agents (ALK and MEK inhibitors), 2 off-label and 1 as part of a clinical trial. One patient with an AGAP3::BRAF fusion positive melanoma experienced a 30-month long response to trametinib.

The clinical course of patients with HRR gene alterations who have metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) has not been fully characterized. Here, we examine the outcomes of men with mHSPC with HRR alterations.  Methods:   We conducted a single-center retrospective analysis of men with mHSPC who underwent next generation sequencing. The primary objective was to assess the time from diagnosis of mHSPC to metastatic castrate resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC) in patients with pathogenic HRR alterations compared to individuals lacking these alterations. Key secondary objectives included time to mCRPC in prespecified cohorts, PSA response, and overall survival.  Results:   151 men with mHSPC were identified for the study. 24% (N = 37) had pathogenic HRR gene alterations detected with the most common alterations found in BRCA2 (n = 15), ATM (n = 10), and CDK12 (n = 7). Time to mCRPC was significantly decreased in patients with HRR gene alterations versus those without such alterations (12.7 vs. 16.1 months, HR 1.95, P = .02). In multivariate analysis, the effect of HRR gene alterations on time to CRPC remained significant when adjusting for age, mHSPC therapy, the volume of disease, the presence of visceral metastases, and PSA (adjusted HR 1.69, P = .02). Stratified by specific HRR gene alteration, patients with BRCA2 or CDK12 had significantly decreased time to mCRPC compared to other HRR alterations.  Conclusion:   HRR gene alterations are associated with the worse outcomes in mHSPC with significantly shorter time to mCRPC. Given the established role of Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in mCRPC, these data highlight an opportunity to examine PARP inhibitors earlier in the clinical course for prostate cancer patients. Ongoing prospective studies will further validate the role of PARP inhibitors in mHSPC patients.""","""['Aaron M Lee', 'Ava Saidian', 'Justin Shaya', 'Taylor Nonato', 'Angelo Cabal', 'J Michael Randall', 'Frederick Millard', 'Tyler Stewart', 'Brent Rose', 'Pablo Tamayo', 'Rana R McKay']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Genitourin Cancer""","""['The prevalence of gene mutations in homologous recombination repair pathways in Japanese patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in real-world clinical practice: The multi-institutional observational ZENSHIN study.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Impact of mutations in homologous recombination repair genes on treatment outcomes for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'When and How to Use PARP Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review of the Literature with an Update on On-Going Trials.', 'Olaparib for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Frequency of Germline and Somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations in Prostate Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Use of PARP inhibitors in prostate cancer: from specific to broader application.']"""

Whether outcomes of pelvic node-positive (cN1) differ from CI node-positive (CI-M1a) prostate cancer after curative treatment is unclear. The present study compares outcomes in patients treated with radical whole pelvic radiation therapy (RT) and long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Methods and materials:   Patients with a node-positive adenocarcinoma prostate were identified, either CI-M1a or cN1, from a prospectively maintained database. More than 75% of patients were staged with Gallium (Ga) 68 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) at the time of diagnosis. All patients received long-term ADT and moderately or extremely hypofractionated RT to the prostate and pelvis, including the CI region. At the time of biochemical failure (BCF), restaging was done with Ga68-PSMA-PET/CT to establish the patterns of failure. The CI-M1a cohort was classified as proximal or distal CI nodal location, and studied for outcomes.  Results:   Of the 130 patients analyzed, 87 had cN1 and 43 had CI-M1a stage disease. The median duration of ADT before RT was 7 months, and total duration was at least 24 months. The majority of patients (65%) had Gleason grade group IV to V, and 75% had â¥T3 disease. After a median follow up of 61 months, BCF in the 2 groups was similar (cN1: n = 21 of 87; 24.1%; CI-M1a: n = 11 of 43; 25.6%; P = .86). At the time of BCF, restaging Ga68-PSMA-PET/CT located distant metastases in 20 of 32 patients (63%; 57% in cN1 and 73% in CI-M1a; P = .47). In addition, the 5-year biochemical failure-free (cN1: 77.4%; CI-M1a: 70.4%; P = .43), distant metastasis-free (cN1: 86.9%; CI-M1a: 79.4%; P = .23), and overall (cN1: 92.6%; CI-M1a 90.1%; P = .80) survival were similar in the 2 groups. Outcomes within CI-M1a were similar for proximal versus distal CI nodal location and 5-year biochemical failure-free survival (73.6% vs 58.6%; P = .81).  Conclusions:   Patients with oligometastatic CI-M1a and cN1 prostate cancer showed similar outcomes when treated with curative whole pelvic RT and long-term ADT. The treatment for these oligometastatic patients should be prospectively evaluated.""","""['Pradnya Chopade', 'Priyamvada Maitre', 'Sam David', 'Gitanjali Panigrahi', 'Pallavi Singh', 'Reena Phurailatpam', 'Vedang Murthy']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Site-specific relapse patterns of patients with biochemical recurrence following radical prostatectomy assessed by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT or 11C-Choline PET/CT: impact of postoperative treatments.', 'Outcome after PSMA-PET/CT-based salvage radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Influence of localization of PSMA-positive oligo-metastases on efficacy of metastasis-directed external-beam radiotherapy-a multicenter retrospective study.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.']"""

This variation may reflect less wish to complain or inequitable access to complaint channels or remedies. We aimed to investigate associations between sociodemographic characteristics and health users' wish to complain.  Study design:   This was a randomized case vignette survey among 6756 Danish men aged 45-70 years (30% response rate).  Methods:   Assuming they received the care in vignettes about prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen) testing, participants rated their wish to complain on a 5-point Likert scale. Information on sociodemographic characteristics was obtained through self-reports and municipality-level information from national registries.  Results:   Lower education was associated with an increased wish to complain (mean Likert difference 0.44 [95% CI 0.36-0.51]; P < .001). The wish to complain was higher among unemployed men (difference 0.16 [95% CI 0.04-0.28]; P < .011) and those with a chronic illness (difference 0.06 [95% CI 0.02-0.10]; P < .004). Given the same healthcare scenarios, there was no difference in wish to complain among health users who were retired, living rurally, or from lower income groups.  Conclusions:   Health users who are less educated, lower income, elderly, or from rural or minority communities appear to be as likely, or more likely, to wish to complain about health care as others. Yet, younger, well-educated, and higher income citizens are overrepresented in actual complaint statistics.

We used data linkages between the cancer registries and the causes of death registry and vital statistics and active follow-up approaches to ascertain the vital status of the patients. Five-year net survival was estimated through the relative survival analysis. We applied the international cancer survival standard weights for age standardization. Five-year survival was highest for prostate cancer (74.9%, 95% CI 73.0, 76.8), followed by breast (74.4%, 95% CI 72.50, 76.3), bladder (70.4%, 95% CI 69.0, 71.8) and cervix (65.2%, 95% CI 60.5, 69.6).

In contrast to previous studies considering survival following treatment, this study aimed to develop a prognostic model to quantify breast cancer-specific survival at the time of diagnosis.  Methods:   A large (n = 3323), population-based prospective cohort of women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in Queensland, Australia between 2010 and 2013, and followed up to December 2018. Data were collected through a validated semi-structured telephone interview and a self-administered questionnaire, along with data linkage to the Queensland Cancer Register and additional extraction from medical records. Flexible parametric survival models, with multiple imputation to deal with missing data, were used.  Results:   Key factors identified as being predictive of poorer survival included more advanced stage at diagnosis, higher tumour grade, ""triple negative"" breast cancers, and being symptom-detected rather than screen detected. The Harrell's C-statistic for the final predictive model was 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.87), while the area under the ROC curve for 5-year mortality was 0.87. The final model explained about 36% of the variation in survival, with stage at diagnosis alone explaining 26% of the variation.  Conclusions:   In addition to confirming the prognostic importance of stage, grade and clinical subtype, these results highlighted the independent survival benefit of breast cancers diagnosed through screening, although lead and length time bias should be considered.

To address these challenges, we developed and evaluated a new drug paradigm, Radio-IMmunostimulant (RIMS), in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer. RIMS-1 was generated using a convergent synthesis employing solid phase peptide and solution chemistries. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitory constant for natLu-RIMS-1 was determined, and radiolabeling with 177Lu generated 177Lu-RIMS-1. The TLR 7/8 agonist payload release from natLu-RIMS-1 was determined using a cathepsin B assay. The biodistribution of 177Lu-RIMS-1 was evaluated in a bilateral xenograft model in NCru nude mice bearing PSMA(+) (PC3-PiP) and PSMA(-) (PC3-Flu) tumors at 2, 24, and 72 h. The therapeutic effect of 177Lu-RIMS-1 was evaluated in C57BL/6J mice bearing RM1-PGLS (PSMA-positive, green fluorescent protein-positive, and luciferase-positive) tumors and compared to that of 177Lu-PSMA-617 at the same total administered radioactivity of 57 MBq and molar activity of 5.18 MBq/nmol. natLu-RIMS-1 and vehicle were evaluated as the controls. Immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) using 89Zr-DFO-anti-CD3 was used to visualize T-cell distribution during treatment. 177Lu-RIMS-1 was quantitatively radiolabeled at >99% radiochemical purity and maintained a high affinity toward PSMA (Ki = 3.77 Â± 0.5 nM). Cathepsin B efficiently released the entire immunostimulant payload in 17.6 h. 177Lu-RIMS-1 displayed a sustained uptake in PSMA(+) tumor tissue up to 72 h (2.65 Â± 1.03% ID/g) and was not statistically different (P = 0.1936) compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617 (3.65 Â± 0.59% ID/g). All animals treated with 177Lu-RIMS-1 displayed tumor growth suppression and provided a median survival of 30 days (P = 0.0007) while 177Lu-PSMA-617 provided a median survival of 15 days, which was not statistically significant (P = 0.3548) compared to the vehicle group (14 days). ImmunoPET analysis revealed 2-fold more tumor infiltrating T-cells in 177Lu-RIMS-1-treated animals compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617-treated animals; 177Lu-RIMS-1 improves therapeutic outcomes in a syngeneic model of mouse prostate cancer and elicits greater T-cell infiltration to the tumor compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617.

Precisely how kinase activity is directly exploited by cancer cell mitochondria to meet high-energy demand, remains to be deciphered. Here we show that a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, TNK2/ACK1 (tyrosine kinase non receptor 2), phosphorylated ATP5F1A (ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha) at Tyr243 and Tyr246 (Tyr200 and 203 in the mature protein, respectively) that not only increased the stability of complex V, but also increased mitochondrial energy output in cancer cells. Further, phospho-ATP5F1A (p-Y-ATP5F1A) prevented its binding to its physiological inhibitor, ATP5IF1 (ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1), causing sustained mitochondrial activity to promote cancer cell growth. TNK2 inhibitor, (R)-9b reversed this process and induced mitophagy-based autophagy to mitigate prostate tumor growth while sparing normal prostate cells. Further, depletion of p-Y-ATP5F1A was needed for (R)-9b-mediated mitophagic response and tumor growth. Moreover, Tnk2 transgenic mice displayed increased p-Y-ATP5F1A and loss of mitophagy and exhibited formation of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PINs). Consistent with these data, a marked increase in p-Y-ATP5F1A was seen as prostate cancer progressed to the malignant stage. Overall, this study uncovered the molecular intricacy of tyrosine kinase-mediated mitochondrial energy regulation as a distinct cancer cell mitochondrial vulnerability and provided evidence that TNK2 inhibitors can act as ""mitocans"" to induce cancer-specific mitophagy.Abbreviations: ATP5F1A: ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha; ATP5IF1: ATP synthase inhibitory factor subunit 1; CRPC: castration-resistant prostate cancer; DNM1L: dynamin 1 like; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; Mdivi-1: mitochondrial division inhibitor 1; Mut-ATP5F1A: Y243,246A mutant of ATP5F1A; OXPHOS: oxidative phosphorylation; PC: prostate cancer; PINK1: PTEN induced kinase 1; p-Y-ATP5F1A: phosphorylated tyrosine 243 and 246 on ATP5F1A; TNK2/ACK1: tyrosine kinase non receptor 2; Ub: ubiquitin; WT: wild type.""","""['Surbhi Chouhan', 'Mithila Sawant', 'Cody Weimholt', 'Jingqin Luo', 'Robert W Sprung', 'Mailyn Terrado', 'David M Mueller', 'H Shelton Earp', 'Nupam P Mahajan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Autophagy""","""['Aberrant mitochondrial morphology and function associated with impaired mitophagy and DNM1L-MAPK/ERK signaling are found in aged mutant Parkinsonian LRRK2R1441G mice.', 'Alternative mitochondrial quality control mediated by extracellular release.', 'PHB2 (prohibitin 2) promotes PINK1-PRKN/Parkin-dependent mitophagy by the PARL-PGAM5-PINK1 axis.', 'ACK1/TNK2 tyrosine kinase: molecular signaling and evolving role in cancers.', 'Organelle-specific autophagy in inflammatory diseases: a potential therapeutic target underlying the quality control of multiple organelles.', 'Epigenetic reprogramming of cell cycle genes by ACK1 promotes breast cancer resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitor.']"""

In healthy patients, dental implant treatment has found wide acceptance in prosthetic rehabilitation as it increases the patient's oral health-related quality of life. However, it is considered contraindicated in patients on HDAR due to the risk of MRONJ, although a recent feasibility study indicates that implant treatment may indeed be an option in these patients. The aim of the present case report is to illustrate the risk of MRONJ in a patient with cancer on HDAR and to discuss the reasons behind the outcomes of the implant treatment.  Materials and methods:   A patient with prostate cancer with bone metastases on high-dose denosumab therapy with previous MRONJ had four implants inserted bilaterally in the maxilla (14, 13, 23, 24). Two identical implant-supported screw-retained cantilever bridges were fabricated. The patient was followed for more than 1 year.  Results and conclusion:   Peri-implantitis, and/or MRONJ, was diagnosed around two of the implants (23, 24), probably induced by crestal bone trauma from a healing abutment and/or a misfitting prosthetic reconstruction. A peri-implantitis operation was performed, but without the desired response, and the two implants (23, 24) were later removed in an MRONJ resection. The implants on the other side of the maxilla (14, 13) remained without complications. Dental implant treatment is feasible in patients on HDAR, but comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus) and polypharmacy (e.g., chemotherapy and steroids) may add to the risk of implant failure. Minimal trauma surgery and prosthodontics are crucial to increase the chance of successful healing in an HDAR patient.""","""['Camilla Ottesen', 'Sanne W M Andersen', 'Simon S Jensen', 'Thomas Kofod', 'Klaus Gotfredsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Exp Dent Res""","""['Outcome of healing after dental implant placement in patients with cancer on high-dose antiresorptive medications: a prospective feasibility study.', 'Clinical and Radiographic Outcomes of Dental Implants in Patients Treated With Antiresorptive Drugs: A Consecutive Case Series.', 'Clinical features of peri-implant medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw: Is there an association to peri-implantitis?', 'Interventions for managing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw.', 'Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Subsequent to Peri-Implantitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Medication-Related Osteonecrosis: Why the Jawbone?']"""

The most recent procedure for the treatment of PDAC is a combination of several conventional chemotherapeutic agents, termed FOLFIRINOX, that includes irinotecan, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). However, ongoing treatment using these agents is challenging due to their severe side effects and limitations on the range of patients available for PDAC. Therefore, safer and more innovative anticancer agents must be developed. The anticarcinoma activity of matairesinol that can be extracted from seagrass has been reported in various types of cancer, including prostate, breast, cervical, and pancreatic cancer. However, the molecular mechanism of effective anticancer activity of matairesinol against pancreatic cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we confirmed the inhibition of cell proliferation and progression induced by matairesinol in representative human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1). Additionally, matairesinol triggers apoptosis and causes mitochondrial impairment as evidenced by the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, disruption of calcium, and suppression of cell migration and related intracellular signaling pathways. Finally, matairesinol exerts a synergistic effect with 5-FU, a standard anticancer agent for PDAC.

The catheters are then inserted using a template that helps to guide the catheters. For certain applications, it is of interest to choose the optimal location and number of catheters needed for dose coverage and potential decrease of the treatment's toxicity. Hence, it is of great importance to develop patient-specific algorithms for catheters and dose optimization.  Methods:   A modified Centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) algorithm is implemented and merged with a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based multi-criteria optimization algorithm (gMCO). The CVT algorithm optimizes the catheters' positions, and the gMCO algorithm optimizes the dwell times and dwell positions. The CVT algorithm can be used simultaneously for insertion with or without a template. Some improvements to the CVT algorithm are presented such as a new way of considering the area that needs to be covered. One hundred eight previously treated prostates HDR cases using real-time ultrasound are used to evaluate the different optimization procedures. The plan robustness is evaluated using two types of errors: deviations (random) in the insertion and deviation (systematic) in the reconstruction of the catheters.  Results:   Using gMCO on clinically inserted catheter increases the acceptance rate by 37% for Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) criteria. Our results show that all the patients respect RTOG criteria with 11 catheters using CVT+gMCO with a template of 5 mm. The number of catheters needed for all patients to respect RTOG criteria with the freehand technique is 10 catheters using CVT+gMCO. When deviations are introduced, using a template, the acceptance rate goes to 85% with 3 mm deviations using 11 catheters. This decrease is less significant when the number of catheters is higher, decreasing by less than 5% with a 3 mm deviation using 13 catheters or more. In conclusion, it is feasible to decrease the number of catheters needed to treat most patients.  Conclusions:   Some cases still need a high number of catheters to reach the plan's criteria. Using gMCO allows an increase in the plan quality, while using CVT reduces the number of catheters. A higher number of catheters equates to plans that are more robust to deviations.""","""['Philippe Y Chatigny', 'CÃ©dric BÃ©langer', 'Ãric Poulin', 'Luc Beaulieu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Adaptation of the CVT algorithm for catheter optimization in high dose rate brachytherapy.', 'A GPU-based multi-criteria optimization algorithm for HDR brachytherapy.', 'Comparison of dose and catheter optimization algorithms in prostate high-dose-rate brachytherapy.', 'Bi-objective optimization of catheter positions for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.']"""

Recent research has focused on the link between high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and the onset/development of several different types of cancer in humans. As a result, scientists are now paying more attention to HPV and CRC. In a variety of malignant tumors, P63 is overexpressed. This includes non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast carcinoma, as well as lung, bladder, and prostate cancers. However, in accordance with the existence of many P63 isoforms in malignant tumors, the actions of P63 in these malignancies remain a source of debate. P63 immunohistochemistry expression in CRC tissues is being investigated as a possible etiological link between high-risk HPV types and CRC. This retrospective study intended to investigate if there was an etiological link between high-risk HPV types and CRC. It has utilized 92 chosen formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue block samples. The collected samples were divided into 62 blocks of colorectal adenocarcinoma mass tissues and 30 non-malignant colorectal tissues used as a control group. Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was employed to discover HPV DNA16/18 in colorectal tissues.

In this research, the additive value of super early scanning in diagnosing primary lesions and metastasis in the pelvic cavity was evaluated. Firstly, the differentiation efficiency of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scanned at 3 min post-injection (min P.I.) was measured in PSMA-positive (22rv1 cells) and PSMA-negative (PC3 cells) model mice. Secondly, 106 patients were scanned at 3 min P.I. for the pelvic cavity and then scanned as a standard protocol at 45 min P.I. In the results, the differential diagnosis of PSMA expression was completely reflected as early as 3 min P.I. for mice models. For patients, when correlated with the Gleason score, the quantitative results of the super early scan displayed a comparable correlation coefficient with the routine scan. The target to bladder ratios increased from 1.44 Â± 2.40 at 45 min to 10.10 Â± 19.10 at 3 min (p < 0.001) for the primary lesions, and it increased from 0.99 Â± 1.88 to 9.27 Â± 23.03 for metastasis. Meanwhile, the target to background ratios increased from 2.21 Â± 2.44 at 3 min to 19.13 Â± 23.93 at 45 min (p < 0.001) for the primary lesions, and it increased from 1.68 Â± 2.71 to 12.04 Â± 18.73 (p < 0.001) for metastasis.

However, PSMA-TRT cannot be used for curative intent yet, thus additional research on how to improve the therapeutic efficacy is warranted. A potential way of achieving this, is combining TRT with poly ADP-ribosylation inhibitors (PARPi), which has shown promising results for TRT of neuroendocrine tumor cells. Currently, several clinical trials have been initiated for this combination for PCa, however so far, no evidence of synergism is available for PCa. Therefore, we evaluated the combination of PSMA-TRT with three classes of PARPi in preclinical PCa models. In vitro viability and survival assays were performed using PSMA-expressing PCa cell lines PC3-PIP and LNCaP to assess the effect of increasing concentrations of PARPi veliparib, olaparib or talazoparib in combination with PSMA-TRT compared to single PARPi treatment. Next, DNA damage analyses were performed by quantifying the number of DNA breaks by immunofluorescent stainings. Lastly, the potential of the combination treatments was studied in vivo in mice bearing PC3-PIP xenografts. Our results show that combining PSMA-TRT with PARPi did not synergistically affect the in vitro clonogenic survival or cell viability. DNA-damage analysis revealed only a significant increase in DNA breaks when combining PSMA-TRT with veliparib and not in the other combination treatments. Moreover, PSMA-TRT with PARPi treatment did not improve tumor control compared to PSMA-TRT monotherapy. Overall, the data presented do not support the assumption that combining PSMA-TRT with PARPi leads to a synergistic antitumor effect in PCa. These results underline that extensive preclinical research using various PCa models is imperative to validate the applicability of the combination strategy for PCa, as it is for other cancer types.""","""['Eline A M Ruigrok', 'Nicole S Verkaik', 'Erik de Blois', 'Corrina de Ridder', 'Debra Stuurman', 'Stefan J Roobol', 'Dik C Van Gent', 'Marion de Jong', 'Wytske M Van Weerden', 'Julie Nonnekens']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['PARP inhibitor veliparib and HDAC inhibitor SAHA synergistically co-target the UHRF1/BRCA1 DNA damage repair complex in prostate cancer cells.', '213Bi-Labeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Targeting Agents Induce DNA Double-Strand Breaks in Prostate Cancer Xenografts.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of 203/212Pb-Labeled Low-Molecular-Weight Compounds for Targeted Radiopharmaceutical Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting PARP proteins in acute leukemia: DNA damage response inhibition and therapeutic strategies.', 'The Future of PSMA-Targeted Radionuclide Therapy: An Overview of Recent Preclinical Research.', 'Selective ablation of TRA-1-60+ pluripotent stem cells suppresses tumor growth of prostate cancer.', 'Neurogenesis manifestations of solid tumor and tracer imaging studies: a narrative review.', 'Patient outcomes following a response biomarker-guided approach to treatment using 177Lu-PSMA-I&T in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (Re-SPECT).', 'In Vivo Efficacy Testing of Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy Radiosensitization Using Olaparib.', 'Pharmacological Optimization of PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy.']"""

Therefore, reactive stroma-based biomarkers may potentially improve the early detection of aggressive PCa, ameliorating disease classification. Gene expression profiles of PCa reactive fibroblasts highlighted the up-regulation of genes related to stroma deposition, including periostin and sparc. Here, the potential of periostin as a stromal biomarker has been investigated on PCa prostatectomies by immunohistochemistry. Moreover, circulating levels of periostin and sparc have been assessed in a low-risk PCa patient cohort enrolled in active surveillance (AS) by ELISA. We found that periostin is mainly expressed in the peritumoral stroma of prostatectomies, and its stromal expression correlates with PCa grade and aggressive disease features, such as the cribriform growth. Moreover, stromal periostin staining is associated with a shorter biochemical recurrence-free survival of PCa patients. Interestingly, the integration of periostin and sparc circulating levels into a model based on standard clinico-pathological variables improves its performance in predicting disease reclassification of AS patients.

Many of them induce adverse effects on human health-such as obesity, fertility disorders and cancers-by perturbing hormone effects. We previously identified many compounds with EDC activity in the circulation of obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Herein, we analyzed the effects of four of them (aldrin, BDE28, PFOA and PCB153) on two cancer cell lines of hormone-sensitive organs (prostate and breast). Each cell line was exposed to serial dilutions of EDCs from 10-6 M to 10-12 M; cytotoxicity and proliferation were monitored using the IncuCyteÂ® technology. We showed that none of these EDCs induce cytotoxicity and that PFOA and PCB153, only at very low doses (10-12 M), increase the proliferation of DU145 (prostate cancer) and MCF7 (breast cancer) cells, while the same effects are observed with high concentrations (10-6 M) for aldrin or BDE28. Regarding the mechanistic aspects, PFOA uses two different signaling pathways between the two lines (the Akt/mTORC1 and PlexinD1 in MCF7 and DU145, respectively). Thus, our study demonstrates that even at picomolar (10-12 M) concentrations PFOA and PCB153 increase the proliferation of prostate and breast cancer cell lines and can be considered possible carcinogens.""","""['AurÃ©lie Charazac', 'Charlotte Hinault', 'Bastien Dolfi', 'SolÃ¨ne Hautier', 'CÃ©lia DecondÃ© Le Butor', 'FrÃ©dÃ©ric Bost', 'Nicolas Chevalier']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['The Adipose Tissue at the Crosstalk Between EDCs and Cancer Development.', 'Perfluorinated chemicals, PFOS and PFOA, enhance the estrogenic effects of 17Î²-estradiol in T47D human breast cancer cells.', 'Combined Effects of Different Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) on Prostate Gland.', 'Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure promotes proliferation, migration and invasion potential in human breast epithelial cells.', 'Effects of Pubertal Exposure to Butyl Benzyl Phthalate, Perfluorooctanoic Acid, and Zeranol on Mammary Gland Development and Tumorigenesis in Rats.', 'Interplay between Prostate Cancer and Adipose Microenvironment: A Complex and Flexible Scenario.']"""

After the first parabola, alterations of the F-actin cytoskeleton-like stress fibers and pseudopodia are visible. Moreover, numerous significant transcriptional changes are evident. We were able to identify a network of relevant PC cytokines and chemokines showing differential expression due to gravitational changes, particularly during the early flight phases.

For the efficient identification of candidate genes, a database was used, for which mRNA expression was correlated with MYC using datasets featuring ""Similar"" and ""Not exactly similar"" contexts. INTS14 and ERI2 were identified using datasets featuring the ""Similar"" context group, and INTS14 and ERI2 were capable of enhancing MYC promoter activity. In further database analysis of human cancers, a higher expression of MYC mRNA was observed in the INTS14 mRNA high-expressing prostate and liver cancers. The knockdown of INTS14 in prostate cell lines resulted in decreased MYC mRNA and protein expression and also induced G0/1 arrest.

NEPC results from trans-differentiated castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) with increasing evidence indicating that the incidence of NEPC often results from the adaptive response to androgen deprivation therapy. Recent studies have shown that a subset of NEPC exhibits overexpression of the MYCN oncogene along with the loss of tumor suppressing TP53 and RB1 activities. N-MYC is structurally disordered with no binding pockets available on its surface and so far, no clinically approved drug is available. We adopted a drug-repurposing strategy, screened ~1800 drug molecules, and identified fludarabine phosphate to preferentially inhibit the proliferation of N-MYC overexpressing NEPC cells by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS).

This is problematic as evidence suggests that most men do not adhere to AS protocols. We sought to develop a novel method of identifying men on AS or watchful waiting (WW) independent of post-diagnostic testing and aimed to identify possible predictors of follow-up intensity in men on AS/WW.  Methods:   A predictive model was developed using SEER watchful waiting data to identify men â¥66 years on AS between 2010-2015, irrespective of post-diagnostic testing, and applied to SEER-Medicare database. AS intensity among different variables including age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, number of total and positive biopsy cores, Charlson comorbidity index, race (Black vs. non-Black), US census region, and county poverty, income, and education levels were compared using multivariable regression analyses for PSA testing, surveillance biopsy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Results:   A total of 2238 men were identified as being on AS. Of which, 81%, 33%, and 10% had a PSA test, surveillance biopsy, and MRI scan within 1-2 years, respectively. On multivariable analyses, Black men were less likely to have a PSA test (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 0.60, 95% CI: 0.53-0.69), MRI scan (ARR 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24-0.68), and surveillance biopsy (ARR 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92) than non-Black men. Men within the highest income quintile were more likely to undergo PSA test (ARR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.05-1.27) and MRI scan (ARR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15-2.27) compared to men with the lowest income.  Conclusions:   Black men and men with lower incomes on AS underwent less rigorous monitoring.

Interviews were conducted in person or via telephone.  Participants:   Patients who had undergone a MRI scan of the prostate as part of their diagnostic work-up for possible prostate cancer, and GPs who had referred at least one patient for possible prostate cancer in the preceding 12 months.  Results:   22 patients (aged 47-80 years) and 10 GPs (6 female, aged 38-58 years) were interviewed. Patients described three key themes: cancer beliefs in relation to patient's attitudes towards prostate cancer;communication with their GP and specialist having a significant impact on experience of the pathway and pathway experience being influenced by appointment and test burden. GP interview themes included: the challenges of dealing with imperfect information in the current pathway; managing uncertainty in identifying patients with possible prostate cancer and sharing this uncertainty with them, and other social, cultural and personal contextual influences.  Conclusions:   Patients and GPs reported a range of experiences and views of the current prostate cancer diagnostic pathways in England. Patients valued 'one-stop' pathways integrating prostate MRI and diagnostic consultations with specialists over the more traditional approach of several hospital appointments.

Twelve participants were recruited using the purposive sampling technique. A semi-structured face to face, in-depth interviews were conducted with family caregivers of patients living with prostate cancer. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the data were analysed using Colaizzi's phenomenological approach.  Findings:   The family caregiver's experience with the physical impact associated with caregiving uncovered two significant themes with six sub-themes. ""Rest and Sleep"" emerged as the first central theme, with sleeplessness, fatigue, pain, and worsening pre-existing conditions as the sub-themes. The second main theme was 'Nutrition' with altered eating patterns and weight loss emerging as sub-themes.  Conclusion:   The study suggests that family caregivers of patients treated for prostate cancer may struggle with physical consequences associated with the caregiving role, which impacts their physical health.

During the biopsy procedure, up to 12 biopsy cores are randomly sampled from six zones within the prostate, where the histopathology of those cores is used to determine the presence and grade of the cancer. Histopathology reports only provide statistical information on the presence of cancer and do not normally contain fine-grain information of cancer distribution within each core. This limitation hinders the development of machine learning models to detect the presence of cancer in ultrasound so that biopsy can be more targeted to highly suspicious prostate regions.  Methods:   In this paper, we tackle this challenge in the form of training with noisy labels derived from histopathology. Noisy labels often result in the model overfitting to the training data, hence limiting its generalizability. To avoid overfitting, we focus on the generalization of the features of the model and present an iterative data label refinement algorithm to amend the labels gradually. We simultaneously train two classifiers, with the same structure, and automatically stop the training when we observe any sign of overfitting. Then, we use a confident learning approach to clean the data labels and continue with the training. This process is iteratively applied to the training data and labels until convergence.  Results:   We illustrate the performance of the proposed method by classifying prostate cancer using a dataset of ultrasound images from 353 biopsy cores obtained from 90 patients. We achieve area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 0.73, 0.80, 0.63, and 0.69, respectively.  Conclusion:   Our approach is able to provide clinicians with a visualization of regions that likely contain cancerous tissue to obtain more accurate biopsy samples. The results demonstrate that our proposed method produces superior accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods.""","""['Golara Javadi', 'Samareh Samadi', 'Sharareh Bayat', 'Samira Sojoudi', 'Antonio Hurtado', 'Walid Eshumani', 'Silvia Chang', 'Peter Black', 'Parvin Mousavi', 'Purang Abolmaesumi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Multiple instance learning combined with label invariant synthetic data for guiding systematic prostate biopsy: a feasibility study.', 'Coarse label refinement for improving prostate cancer detection in ultrasound imaging.', 'Deep neural maps for unsupervised visualization of high-grade cancer in prostate biopsies.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In total, 113 CT-guided bone biopsies performed in cancer patients by an interventional radiologist in one institution were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty-five sclerotic bone biopsies were eventually included and routine blood parameters and tumour marker levels were recorded. Non-contrast (NC) biopsy CTs (65), contrast-enhanced CTs (24), and PET/CTs (22) performed within four weeks of biopsy were reviewed; lesion location, diameter, lesion-to-cortex distance, and NC-CT appearance (dense-sclerosis versus mild-sclerosis) were noted. Mean NC-CT, CE-CT HU, and PET SUVmax were derived from biopsy tract and lesion segmentations. Needle diameter, tract length, and number of samples were noted. Comparisons between tumour-positive/negative and next-generation sequencing (NGS)-feasible/non-feasible biopsies determined significant (p < 0.05) laboratory, imaging, and procedural parameter differences.  Results:   Seventy-four percent of biopsies were tumour-positive. NGS was feasible in 22/30 prostate cancer patients (73%). Neither laboratory blood parameters, PET/CT availability, size, nor lesion-to-cortex distance affected diagnostic yield or NGS feasibility (p > 0.298). Eighty-seven percent of mildly sclerotic bone (mean 244 HU) biopsies were positive compared with 56% in dense sclerosis (622 HU, p = 0.005) and NC-CT lesion HU was significantly lower in positive biopsies (p = 0.003). A 610 HU threshold yielded 89% PPV for tumour-positive biopsies and a 370 HU threshold 94% PPV for NGS-feasible biopsies. FDG-PET and procedural parameters were non-significant factors (each p > 0.055).  Conclusion:   In cancer patients with sclerotic bone disease, targeting areas of predominantly mild sclerosis in lower CT-attenuation lesions can improve tumour tissue yield and NGS feasibility.  Key points:   â¢ Areas of predominantly mild sclerosis should be preferred to areas of predominantly dense sclerosis for CT-guided bone biopsies in cancer patients. â¢ Among sclerotic bone lesions in prostate cancer patients, lesions with a mean HU below 370 should be preferred as biopsy targets to improve NGS feasibility. â¢ Laboratory parameters and procedure related factors may have little implications for CT-guided sclerotic bone biopsy success.""","""['Ricardo Donners', 'Nicos Fotiadis', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Matthew Blackledge', 'Daniel Westaby', 'Christina Guo', 'Maria de Los Dolores Fenor de la Maza', 'Dow-Mu Koh', 'Nina Tunariu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Multiparametric bone MRI can improve CT-guided bone biopsy target selection in cancer patients and increase diagnostic yield and feasibility of next-generation tumour sequencing.', 'CT-guided percutaneous biopsy of sclerotic bone lesions: diagnostic outcomes.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Review of CT-guided trans-osseous biopsies.', 'Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Bone Biopsy: Feasibility, Diagnostic Yield and Technical Notes.', 'Percutaneous CT-Guided Bone Biopsies: Indications, Feasibility and Diagnostic Yield in the Different Skeletal Sites-From the Skull to the Toe.']"""

A quantitative method, hybrid multidimensional MRI (HM-MRI), may introduce objectivity. Purpose To compare performance, interobserver agreement, and interpretation time of radiologists using mpMRI versus HM-MRI to diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer. Materials and Methods In this retrospective analysis, men with prostatectomy or MRI-fused transrectal US biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer underwent mpMRI (triplanar T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging) and HM-MRI (with multiple echo times and b value combinations) from August 2012 to February 2020. Four readers with 1-20 years of experience interpreted mpMRI and HM-MRI examinations independently, with a 4-week washout period between interpretations. PI-RADS score, lesion location, and interpretation time were recorded. mpMRI and HM-MRI interpretation time, interobserver agreement (Cronbach alpha), and performance of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis were compared for each radiologist with use of bootstrap analysis. Results Sixty-one men (mean age, 61 years Â± 8 [SD]) were evaluated. Per-patient AUC was higher for HM-MRI for reader 4 compared with mpMRI (AUCs for readers 1-4: 0.61, 0.71, 0.59, and 0.64 vs 0.66, 0.60, 0.50, and 0.46; P = .57, .20, .32, and .04, respectively). Per-patient specificity was higher for HM-MRI for readers 2-4 compared with mpMRI (specificity for readers 1-4: 48%, 78%, 48%, and 46% vs 37%, 26%, 0%, and 7%; P = .34, P < .001, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Diagnostic performance improved for the reader least experienced with HM-MRI, reader 4 (AUC, 0.64 vs 0.46; P = .04). HM-MRI interobserver agreement (Cronbach alpha = 0.88 [95% CI: 0.82, 0.92]) was higher than that of mpMRI (Cronbach alpha = 0.26 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.52]; Î± > .60 indicates reliability; P = .03). HM-MRI mean interpretation time (73 seconds Â± 43 [SD]) was shorter than that of mpMRI (254 seconds Â± 133; P = .03). Conclusion Radiologists had similar or improved diagnostic performance, higher interobserver agreement, and lower interpretation time for clinically significant prostate cancer with hybrid multidimensional MRI than multiparametric MRI.

Objective:   To examine the influence of type of practice structure, and by implication the financial incentives associated with each structure, on treatment received among men newly diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer.  Research design:   We compiled a unique database from cancer registry records from 4 large states, Medicare enrollment and claims for the years 2005-2014 and SK & A physician surveys corroborated by extensive internet searches. We estimated a multinomial logit model to examine the influence of urologist practice structure on type of initial treatment received.  Results:   The probability of being monitored with active surveillance was 7.4% and 4.2% points higher for men treated by health system and nonhealth system employed urologists ( P <0.01), respectively, in comparison to men treated by single specialty urology practices. Among multispecialty practices, the rate of active surveillance use was 3% points higher compared with single specialty urology practices( P <0.01). Use of intensity modulated radiation therapy among urologists with ownership in intensity modulated radiation therapy was 17.4% points higher compared with urologists working in small single specialty practices.  Conclusions:   Physician practice structure attributes are significantly associated with type of treatment received but few studies control for such factors.

Metastatic prostate cancer, however, typically reveals more homogenous molecular profiles, suggesting a monoclonal origin of the metastatic lesions. Longitudinal mutational spectra, comparing multiple primary lesions with metastases from the same patients remain poorly defined. We have here analyzed somatic mutations in multisampled, spatio-temporal biobanked lesions (38 samples from primary foci and 1 sample from each of 8 metastases from seven prostate cancer patients) applying a custom-designed panel targeting 68 prostate cancer relevant genes. The metastatic samples were taken at time of primary surgery and up to 7 years later, and sampling included circulating tumor DNA in plasma or solid metastatic tissue samples. A total of 282 somatic mutations were detected, with a range of 0 to 25 mutations per sample. Although seven samples had solely private mutations, the remaining 39 samples had both private and shared mutations.

However, adverse outcomes can occur many years after treatment. Herein, we aim to assess the utility of using claims data to identify prostate cancer progression 10-15 years after diagnosis.  Methods:   The study population was derived from the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP). PCaP-North Carolina (NC) included 1031 men diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2004 to 2009. An initial follow-up with a survey and manual medical record abstraction occurred from 2008 to 2011 (Follow-up 1). Herein, we extended this follow-up with linkage to healthcare claims data from North Carolina (2011-2017) and a second, supplementary 10-year follow-up survey (2018-2020) (Follow-up 2). Vital statistics data also were utilized. Long-term oncological progression was determined using these data sources in combination with expert clinical input.  Results:   Among the 1031 baseline PCaP-NC participants, 652 were linked to medical claims. Forty-two percent of the men had insurance coverage for the entire 72 months of follow-up. In addition, 275 baseline participants completed the supplementary 10-year follow-up survey. Using all sources of follow-up data, we identified a progression event in 259 of 1031 (25%) men with more than 10 years of follow-up data after diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Understanding long-term clinical outcomes is essential for improving the lives of prostate cancer survivors. However, access and utility of long-term clinical outcomes with claims alone remain a challenge due to individualized agreements required with each insurer for data access, lack of detailed clinical information, and gaps in insurance coverage. We were able to utilize claims data to determine long-term progression due to several unique advantages that included the availability of detailed baseline clinical characteristics and treatments, detailed manually abstracted clinical data at 5 years of follow-up, vital statistics data, and a supplementary 10-year follow-up survey.""","""['Saira Khan', 'Sanah Vohra', 'Laura Farnan', 'Shekinah N C Elmore', 'Khadijah Toumbou', 'Madhav K C', 'Elizabeth T H Fontham', 'Edward S Peters', 'James L Mohler', 'Jeannette T Bensen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP): methods and design of a multidisciplinary population-based cohort study of racial differences in prostate cancer outcomes.', 'Prostate cancer aggressiveness and financial toxicity among prostate cancer patients.', 'Long-term unmet supportive care needs of prostate cancer survivors: 15-year follow-up from the NSW Prostate Cancer Care and Outcomes Study.', 'Early versus deferred androgen suppression in the treatment of advanced prostatic cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

Aim:   To determine the effect that different survey modes (email, telephone, or mail) had on the quantity of missing data and self-reported function following treatment.  Methods:   Men newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and enrolled in the Victorian Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry formed the study population. The Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) survey instrument was administered approximately 1 year after their initial treatment. EPIC-26 measures self-reported function in the sexual, urinary, bowel, and hormonal domains. Multivariable regression models were used to examine effects of survey mode, adjusting for age, residence, socioeconomic status, diagnosing institute type, risk group and primary treatment modality.  Outcomes:   The percentage of patients for whom a domain score could not be calculated due to missing responses and the functional score within each domain.  Results:   Registry staff attempted to reach 8,586 men eligible to complete the EPIC-26. Of these, 4,301 (50%) returned the survey via email, 1,882 (22%) completed by telephone, and 197 (2.3%) by mail. 2,206 (26%) were uncontactable or did not respond. Email responders had the highest proportion answering all 26 questions (95% vs 87% by phone and 67% by mail). The sexual function score was unable to be calculated due to missing responses for 1.3% of email responders, 8.8% by phone, and 8.1% by mail. After adjustment for patient and disease factors, phone responders were almost 6 times more likely than email responders to have a missing score in this domain, odds ratio = 5.84 (95% confidence interval: 4.06-8.40). The adjusted mean functional score (out of 100) was higher for those responding by phone than email or mail across all domains. The largest adjusted difference between phone and email was observed in the hormonal domain (mean difference 4.5, 95% confidence interval: 3.5-5.4), exceeding the published minimally important difference for this score.  Clinical implications:   Studies that ask questions regarding sexual health and use multi-modal data collection methods should be aware that this potentially affects their data and consider adjusting for this factor in their analyses.  Strengths and limitations:   A large study sample utilizing a widely available survey instrument. Patient specific reasons for non-response were not explored.  Conclusion:   Completion mode effects should be considered when analyzing responses to sexual function questions in an older, male population. Papa N, Bensley JG, Perera M, et al.

We defined MS history based on the self-report of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and diabetes; obesity was evaluated using weight-change trajectories throughout life. In addition, the four MS-typologies described for Mexican population were used. The association between MS with PC and histological PC differentiation was evaluated using independent multivariate logistic regression models.  Results:   MS history was associated with a high PC probability (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.37-2.75).

However, the effects of PPP on prostate cancer via ROS production and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway remain elusive. Herein, we focused on examining the antitumor effects of PPP on DU145 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells to determine the possible molecular mechanism. Our data indicated that the inhibitory effect of PPP on the proliferation of DU145 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells was mediated by apoptosis induction and cell cycle blockade. Furthermore, PPP significantly influenced the expression of apoptosis-related, cell cycle, ROS production, and PI3K/AKT signaling proteins.

However, oligometastasis remains poorly understood in terms of its biology and prevalence in the metastatic cascade. In the absence of clinically viable molecular biomarkers, this study examined the prevalence of oligometastasis using oncological imaging.  Methods and materials:   This study is based on all consecutive [fluorine-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)- and [gallium-68]-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positron emission tomography (PET) scans conducted at our cancer center between January and December 2020. We identified and analyzed all PET scans from patients with a maximum of 5 distant metastases from a solid malignancy and also reviewed concurrent cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) imaging in all candidate patients. Data on the number and sites of metastases were extracted from the imaging reports and verified on imaging studies in case of uncertainties.  Results:   In total, 7000 PET scans were analyzed, of which 1155 were performed in unique metastatic patients, and 637 patients showed extracranial oligometastatic disease (55%). Concurrent cMRI scans were available for 20% (130/637) of extracranial oligometastatic patients, 36 of which proved to be polymetastatic after combined PET and cMRI analysis. Prevalence of oligometastatic disease was influenced by primary tumor histology and was most frequent in pancreatic, liver and gallbladder cancers (59%), but was least frequent in cancer of unknown primary (26%). In 72% of oligometastatic cases, only 1 or 2 metastases were detected. Bone/soft tissue metastases were the most common sites of distant metastasis (41%). About 75% of patients had metachronous oligometastatic disease.  Conclusions:   Our analysis suggests that about half of patients with metastatic cancer are characterized by a limited tumor burden detectable on PET and cMRI imaging.

However, no studies to-date have investigated relationships between gastrointestinal microbiota composition and response to checkpoint inhibition in advanced metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal DNA from 23 individuals with mCRPC progressing on enzalutamide and just prior to treatment with anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) to determine whether certain features of the microbiome are associated with treatment response (defined as serum PSA decrease >50% at any time on treatment or radiographic response per RECIST V.1.1). Global bacterial composition was similar between responders and non-responders, as assessed by multiple alpha and beta diversity metrics. However, certain bacterial taxa identified by sequencing across multiple 16S rRNA hypervariable regions were consistently associated with response, including the archetypal oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) of DNA extracts from fecal samples confirmed increased Streptococcus salivarius fecal levels in responders, whereas qPCR of oral swish DNA extracts showed no relationship between oral Streptococcus salivarius levels and response status. Contrary to previous reports in other cancer types, Akkermansia muciniphila levels were reduced in responder samples as assessed by both 16S rRNA sequencing and qPCR. We further analyzed our data in the context of a previously published ""integrated index"" describing bacteria associated with response and non-response to checkpoint inhibition. We found that the index was not reflective of response status in our cohort. Lastly, we demonstrate little change in the microbiome over time, and with pembrolizumab treatment.

This study is to identify critical driver(s) with mechanism of action and explore new targeting strategy.  Methods:   Various PCa cell lines with different genetic manipulations were subjected to in vitro prostasphere assay, cell viability assay and in vivo stemness potential. In addition, bioinformatic analyses such as Ingenuity pathway and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis were carried out to determine clinical relevance. The in vivo anti-tumour activity of JAK or STAT1 inhibitors was examined in clinically relevant t-CRPC model.  Results:   We demonstrated the role of interferon-related signalling pathway in promoting PCa stemness, which correlated with significant elevation of interferon related DNA damage resistance signature genes in metastatic PCa. Inhibition of JAK-STAT1 signalling suppresses the in vitro and in vivo CSC capabilities. Mechanistically, IFIT5, a unique downstream effector of JAK-STAT1 pathway, can facilitate the acquisition of stemness properties in PCa by accelerating the turnover of specific microRNAs (such as miR-128 and -101) that can target several CSC genes (such as BMI1, NANOG, and SOX2). Consistently, knocking down IFIT5 in t-CRPC cell can significantly reduce in vitro prostasphere formation as well as decrease in vivo tumour initiating capability.

As RS provides information on the biochemical composition of tissue samples, this technique could provide insight into the changes which take place on the biochemical level, as result of HDR-BT treatment.""","""['Kirsty Milligan', 'Samantha J Van Nest', 'Xinchen Deng', 'Ramie Ali-Adeeb', 'Phillip Shreeves', 'Samantha Punch', 'Nathalie Costie', 'Nils Pavey', 'Juanita M Crook', 'David M Berman', 'Alexandre G Brolo', 'Julian J Lum', 'Jeffrey L Andrews', 'Andrew Jirasek']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Biophotonics""","""['Prediction of disease progression indicators in prostate cancer patients receiving HDR-brachytherapy using Raman spectroscopy and semi-supervised learning: a pilot study.', 'Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as Predicting Marker for Clinical Outcome and Evaluation of Early Toxicity Rate after High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in Combination with Additional External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) for High Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Ten-year survival after High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy combined with External Beam Radiation Therapy in high-risk prostate cancer: A comparison with the Norwegian SPCG-7 cohort.', 'Combining theoretical potential and advanced technology in high-dose rate brachytherapy boost therapy for prostate cancer.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Understanding radiation response and cell cycle variation in brain tumour cells using Raman spectroscopy.', 'Recent Advances in Raman Spectral Imaging in Cell Diagnosis and Gene Expression Prediction.']"""

Poisson smoothed cumulative incidence plots and competing risks regression (CRR) models addressing OCM, after adjustment for cancer-specific mortality , were fitted. Subsequently, multivariable logistic regression models tested access to cytoreductive nephrectomy (CNT) and systemic therapy (ST).  Results:   Of 10,958 ccmRCC patients, 7,892 (72%), 1,743 (16%), 688 (6%), and 635 (6%) were Caucasian, Hispanic, African American, and Asian, respectively.

And whether nonisotropic PTV margins are beneficial for these structures. Organ motion is linked to the displacement of the prostate and SVs. From the use of MRgRT, the nearby organs at risk (OAR) can be visualized both inter- and intrafraction. This study looked to determine if there is a correlation between interfractional OAR changes and displacements to the prostate and SVs. Inter- and intrafractional data from 20 consecutive prostate cancer patients treated using extreme hypofractionated 0.35 T MRgRT indicated prostate and SV motion during treatment. Tracking points (TPs) on 2D sagittal cine-MRI enabled assessment of this intrafractional motion. To determine a correlation between rectal changes and target displacements, the rectal diameter (RD) changes were compared against the displacement differences (DDs) at the prostate and SVs. Eighty percent of patients required intrafractional imaging corrections during radiotherapy, including 16/100 fractions due to rectal volume increases and 24/100 fractions due to bladder volume increases. The frequency of â¥3 mm intrafraction displacement was considerably greater in TPs in the SV than in the prostate. A moderate positive correlation (R2 = 0.417) was shown between RD changes and DDs at the level of the prostate and SVs. The PTV margins required for 90% of the patient cohort for prostate and SVs are nonuniform in different directions, and the margin is larger for SVs.

We propose a volumetric modulated arc therapy solution that strikes a better balance between dose accuracy and skin dosimetry. Our current planning strategy limits the entrance dose through hip prostheses using stringent optimization objectives on an avoidance structure. Avoidance efficiency is evaluated by recalculating the plan with prosthesis density set at 20 g/cc, and evaluating the loss of target coverage from increased attenuation. We require this loss to be â¤5% of the original values. This approach has resulted in an uncommon skin toxicity for a prostate-bed patient with bilateral hip prostheses. Thus, the dosimetric tradeoffs between skin dose and prosthesis avoidance were investigated by incrementally reducing prosthesis avoidance to achieve maximum skin doses (Dmax) between 30 and 50 Gy. When prosthesis avoidance is prioritized, the skin dose increases and the target dose coverage and conformity decrease. A large degradation in target coverage for plans with the lowest skin Dmax of 30 to 35 Gy indicates that a significant proportion of the target dose arises from beams entering the prostheses. The plan with a skin Dmax of 40 Gy provides a better compromise between skin and prosthesis entrance doses, with a <20% reduction in target coverage at an increased prosthesis density of 20 g/cm3. Skin dose needs to be considered when using prosthesis avoidance planning strategies. Allowing for a minimal dose through the prosthesis may be required to restrict skin dose and reduce the risk of toxicity.""","""['David Y Mak', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Melanie Davidson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Pract Radiat Oncol""","""['Evaluation of VMAT Planning Strategies for Prostate Patients with Bilateral Hip Prosthesis.', 'Dosimetric study of uniform scanning proton therapy planning for prostate cancer patients with a metal hip prosthesis, and comparison with volumetric-modulated arc therapy.', 'Prostate radiotherapy in the setting of bilateral hip prostheses: All commonly used photon-based radiation approaches are feasible.', 'Applying a commercial atlas-based synthetic Computed Tomography algorithm to patients with hip prostheses for prostate Magnetic Resonance-only radiotherapy.', 'VMAT Optimization and Dose Calculation in the Presence of Metallic Hip Prostheses.']"""

We assessed the effect of metformin versus placebo to blunt the adverse effects of ADT on body weight, waist circumference, and other metabolic parameters.  Methods and materials:   This phase 2, multicenter, randomized controlled trial (RCT) randomized normoglycemic men with locally advanced prostate cancer receiving radical RT and ADT (18-36 months) in a 1:1 ratio to receive metformin 500 mg by mouth 3 times a day (for 30-36 months) versus identical placebo.  Results:   From December 2015 to October 2019, 83 men were randomized with median follow-up of 23 months. Baseline mean body mass Index (BMI) of the cohort was 30.2 (range 22.2-52.5). Change in mean weight relative to baseline was lower among men who received metformin compared with placebo at 5 months (-1.80 kg, P = .038), but was not significant with longer follow-up (1 year: +0.16 kg, P = .874). Although participants on ADT had increases in waist circumference in both study arms, metformin did not significantly reduce these changes (1 year: +2.79 cm (placebo) versus +1.46 cm (metformin), P = .336). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was lower in the metformin arm (-0.32 mmol/L) compared with the placebo arm (-0.03 mmol/L) at 5 months (P = .022), but these differences were not significant with longer follow-up (1 year: -0.17 mmol/L vs -0.19 mmol/L, P = .896). There were no differences in HbA1C, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and total cholesterol by study arm.  Conclusions:   Men receiving radical RT and ADT gained weight and had increases in waist circumference over time that metformin did not significantly mitigate.

To evaluate the possibility that prostate tumor-forming cells are also exploiting the anaplerotic role of PC, we applied immunoblotting analysis to estimate its presence. Our results revealed that PC is present among the lysate proteins derived from prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia samples. The expression of PC in cells of prostate tumors and benign prostatic hyperplasia supposes that PC could facilitate the formation of oxaloacetate in situ and enhance the autonomy of their biosynthetic metabolism from the availability of extracellular substrates by increasing the cellular anaplerotic capability (Tab. 1, Fig. 1, Ref. 30).

Numerous studies have shown that night shift work causes disruptions in circadian rhythms that may affect health. In 2019, night shift work was classified as probably carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and may contribute to other health disorders. In this context, we assessed the number and proportion of workers exposed to night work today and investigated time trends by occupation and industry in France since 1982 in terms of prevention.  Methods:   Using the data on work time schedules collected in the French Labour Force Surveys, sex- and period-specific job-exposure matrices (JEMs) to night work (working between midnight and 5 AM) were developed. After linkage of the JEMs with data of the national censuses of 1982, 1990, 1999, 2007 and 2015, the numbers and proportions of workers usually or occasionally exposed to night work were estimated.  Results:   The number of night workers (usual and occasional) increased from 3.67 million in 1982 to 4.37 million in 2015 (15.8% vs 16.4%). Night work was more common in men than in women (e.g. 22.4% vs 10.0% in 2015), and usual night work largely increased after 2000 (4.4% in 1999, 7.2% in 2007). In 2015, 1.29 million men worked usually at night, including 882,000 workers in the service sector (63%) and 360,000 in the manufacturing and extracting industries (28%). For the same period, 581,000 women were usual night workers, most of them being employed in the service sector (90%). Among women, a 97% increase of usual night work was observed between 1982 and 2015.

[18F]-PARPZ was able to distinguish treated from control (saline) xenografts by increased uptake.

Chemotherapy is a prominent treatment method but due to undesired side effects t, there has been a need for novel less toxic approaches. Photodynamic therapy may be listed among the alternatives for efficient and potentially less detrimental applications of cancer therapy. Canonical photodynamic therapy (PDT) approach requires a light source with a specific wavelength of light, a non-toxic photosensitizer and molecular oxygen. PDT creates the desired effect by the photochemical reaction created through interaction of these components to create reactive oxygen species that will act on the cancer cells to enable anti-cancer activities. In our study we focus on non-canonical PDT application. In this approach we are not only aiming to eliminate cancer cells in the environment but also test the anti-metastatic, anti-angiogenic and possible immunomodulatory activities of the novel photosensitizers. Moreover, in our approach, we studied the intracellular pathways that are crucial for carcinogenesis, cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, metastasis and immune function to decipher the mechanism of the action for each compound. Reactive oxygen species based explanation was not valid in our study, hence it brings out a non canonical approach to PDT applications. Our results suggests that Phthalocyanine derivatives with imidazole groups can be effectively used against lung, colon, breast and prostate cancer while differentially effecting metastasis, angiogenesis, cell cycle, apoptosis and immune system cells' activities. Based on the results, PDT application of these phthalocyanine derivatives can be an effective treatment option to replace chemotherapy to minimize the potential side effects.""","""['Furkan Ayaz', 'Derya Yetkin', 'Abdulcelil YÃ¼zer', 'KÃ¼bra DemircioÄlu', 'Mine Ince']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther""","""['Photodynamic therapy using pheophorbide and 670nm LEDs exhibits anti-cancer effects in-vitro in androgen dependent prostate cancer.', ""A novel pro-apoptotic role of zinc octacarboxyphthalocyanine in melanoma me45 cancer cell's photodynamic therapy (PDT)."", 'Methylsulfonyl Zn phthalocyanine: A polyvalent and powerful hydrophobic photosensitizer with a wide spectrum of photodynamic applications.', 'Pharmaceutical development, composition and quantitative analysis of phthalocyanine as the photosensitizer for cancer photodynamic therapy.', 'Advances in Management of Bladder Cancer-The Role of Photodynamic Therapy.', 'The synthesis of novel water-soluble zinc (II) phthalocyanine based photosensitizers and exploring of photodynamic therapy activities on the PC3 cancer cell line.', 'Global Trends and Research Progress of Photodynamic Therapy in Skin Cancer: A Bibliometric Analysis and Literature Review.', 'Photodynamic therapy for prostate cancer: Recent advances, challenges and opportunities.']"""

Numerous mechanisms trigger the expansion of CRPC among which the aberrant AR gene is considered as the prime factor. Recently three essential substitutions H875Y, F877L, and T878A are reported to cause resistance to Enzalutamide. However, no detailed study is available to explore the key events that contribute to the resistance. Hence, considering the applicability of structural bioinformatics and molecular simulation-based methods in the current study, we assessed the impact of these mutations on the binding of Enzalutamide. Using a long-run simulation approach the binding stability, residues flexibility, hydrogen bonding, and protein compactness for each complex were determined to reveal the dynamic variations induced by these mutations. We discovered that the binding mode of Enzalutamide is altered by these mutations which misstarget the key residues required for the antagonistic activity. Molecular simulation of each complex revealed that the wild type H11 and H12 are more flexible moving outside and provides more volume for the ligand optimization. In the mutant complexes, the H12 remained tighter pushing out enzalutamide from the key residues which then essentially misstarget the correct orientation for the antagonist activity. The binding free energy (BFE) for the wild type was computed to be -59.92 Â± 0.18 kcal/mol, for H875Y the BFE was -55.92 Â± 0.18 kcal/mol, -54.82 Â± 0.15 kcal/mol for F877L and -53.87 Â± 0.18 kcal/mol for T878A, which further demonstrate that these mutations have destabilized the binding of enzalutamide. The proteins' motion and FEL further validated the aforementioned findings where the wild type reported different dynamic features than the mutant complexes. In conclusion, this study provides a structural basis for the resistance to Enzalutamide, which can be used to design novel effective drugs using structure-based and rationale approaches.""","""['Abbas Khan', 'Yuanshen Mao', 'Sana Tahreem', 'Dong-Qing Wei', 'Yanjing Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Biol Macromol""","""['Moving Towards Precision Urologic Oncology: Targeting Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer and Mutated Forms of the Androgen Receptor Using the Novel Inhibitor Darolutamide (ODM-201).', 'Cellular androgen content influences enzalutamide agonism of F877L mutant androgen receptor.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists as Hormonal Therapeutics for Three Forms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A Pegylated Liposome Loaded with Raddeanin A for Prostate Cancer Therapy.']"""

A 78-year-old man had been diagnosed with prostate cancer 8 months ago. He received androgen deprivation therapy with leuprolide acetate 22.5 mg for every 3 months. Castration-resistant prostate cancer was diagnosed due to elevated prostate specific antigen (1639 ng/mL) and cancer fever.  Intervention:   The patient received docetaxel-based systemic chemotherapy 50 mg/mm2 biweekly. Naproxen 500 mg was administered twice a day.  Outcomes:   After one cycle of systemic chemotherapy, the patient had no major side effects, no more fever was observed, and the systemic condition improved.

The roles and mechanisms of long nonâcoding RNA (lncRNA) involved in the development of PCa remain incompletely understood. The present study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of lncRNA in PCa tumorigenesis. In the present study, lncRNA cancer susceptibility candidate 11 (CASC11) was revealed to be a crucial regulator of PCa progression. The expression profiles of CASC11 in PCa were identified through analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus datasets, and validated in human PCa specimens and cell lines. Gainâ and lossâofâfunction assays were utilized to explore the biological role of CASC11 in PCa initiation and progression. RNAâsequencing, RNA pullâdown and RNA immunoprecipitation analyses were used to explore potential mechanisms with which CASC11 may be associated. Rescue experiments were further conducted to confirm this association. The present results revealed that CASC11 was dominantly distributed in the nuclei of PCa cells, and was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells. Overexpression of CASC11 was markedly associated with increased tumor proliferation and migratory ability. Functionally, decreased proliferation and migration, as well as inhibited xenograft tumor growth, were observed in CASC11âsilenced PCa cells, whereas the opposite effects were detected in CASC11âoverexpressing cells. Mechanistically, CASC11 promoted progression of the cell cycle and competitively interacted with Yâbox binding protein 1 (YBX1) to block the p53 pathway. Given this, poly (Î²âamino ester) (PBAE)/small interfering RNAâCASC11 (siâCASC11) nanoparticles were applied to inhibit CASC11 expression and enhance the antitumor effect in vivo. The results revealed that PBAE/siâCASC11 nanoparticles augmented the antitumor efficacy of CASC11 knockdown in vivo. In conclusion, the present study suggested that CASC11 may regulate PCa progression and elucidated a novel CASC11/YBX1/p53 signaling axis, providing a potential lncRNAâdirected therapeutic strategy particularly for the treatment of patients with PCa.""","""['Xianchao Sun#', 'Shiyong Xin#', 'Ying Zhang', 'Liang Jin', 'Xiang Liu', 'Jiaxin Zhang', 'Wangli Mei', 'Bihui Zhang', 'Weiguo Ma', 'Lin Ye']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['The previously uncharacterized lncRNA APP promotes prostate cancer progression by acting as a competing endogenous RNA.', 'CASC11 promotes aggressiveness of prostate cancer cells through miR-145/IGF1R axis.', 'LncRNA DSCAM-AS1 interacts with YBX1 to promote cancer progression by forming a positive feedback loop that activates FOXA1 transcription network.', 'Long non-coding RNA LINP1 promotes the malignant progression of prostate cancer by regulating p53.', 'Stem Cells as Target for Prostate cancer Therapy: Opportunities and Challenges.', 'A review on the role of CASC11 in cancers.', 'Importance of long non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer.', 'VIMâAS1 promotes proliferation and drives enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer via IGF2BP2âmediated HMGCS1 mRNA stabilization.', 'Metabolic Pathways in Breast Cancer Reprograming: An Insight to Non-Coding RNAs.']"""

Elderly male patients over 65 years old account for more than 60% of PC patients, and the impact of surgical treatment on the prognosis of PC patients is controversial. Moreover, there are currently no predictive models that can predict the prognosis of elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. Therefore, we aimed to construct a new nomogram to predict cancer-specific survival (CSS) in elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment.  Methods:   Data for surgically treated PC patients aged 65 years and older were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to identify independent risk factors for elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. A nomogram of elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment was developed based on the multivariate Cox regression model. The consistency index (C-index), the area under the subject operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the calibration curve were used to test the accuracy and discrimination of the predictive model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to examine the potential clinical value of this model.  Results:   A total of 44,975 elderly PC patients undergoing surgery in 2010-2018 were randomly assigned to the training set (N = 31705) and validation set (N = 13270). the training set was used for nomogram development and the validation set was used for internal validation. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression model analysis showed that age, marriage, TNM stage, surgical style, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, Gleason score(GS), and prostate-specific antigen(PSA) were independent risk factors for CSS in elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment. The C index of the training set and validation indices are 0.911(95%CI: 0.899-0.923) and 0.913(95%CI: 0.893-0.933), respectively, indicating that the nomogram has a good discrimination ability. The AUC and the calibration curves also show good accuracy and discriminability.  Conclusions:   To our knowledge, our nomogram is the first predictive model for elderly PC patients undergoing surgical treatment, filling the gap in current predictive models for this PC patient population. Our data comes from the SEER database, which is trustworthy and reliable. Moreover, our model has been internally validated in the validation set using the C-index,AUC and the and the calibration curve, showed that the model have good accuracy and reliability, which can help clinicians and patients make better clinical decision-making.

The APOBEC3 family of proteins is known to play a significant role in defense against HPV infection, but their role in PSC is largely unknown. In this study, we aim to assess mRNA expression levels of APOBEC3 family members in HPV+ and HPV- PSC to get insight into their association with clinicopathological features and to evaluate their prognostic impact. Expression levels of six APOBEC3 family members in tissue from 50 patients with PSC were determined by RT-PCR and correlated with clinical and histopathological features.

However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying the AR functioning as a tumor promoter in inducing prostatic oncogenesis still remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of prostatic Osr1 (odd skipped-related 1)-lineage cells functions as tumor progenitors in prostate tumorigenesis. Single cell transcriptomic analyses reveal that aberrant AR activation in these cells elevates insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) signaling pathways and initiates oncogenic transformation. Elevating IGF1 signaling further cumulates Wnt/Î²-catenin pathways in transformed cells to promote prostate tumor development. Correlations between altered androgen, IGF1, and Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling are also identified in human prostate cancer samples, uncovering a dynamic regulatory loop initiated by the AR through prostate cancer development. Co-inhibition of androgen and Wnt-signaling pathways significantly represses the growth of AR-positive tumor cells in both ex-vivo and in-vivo, implicating co-targeting therapeutic strategies for these pathways to treat advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Won Kyung Kim#', 'Adam W Olson#', 'Jiaqi Mi', 'Jinhui Wang', 'Dong-Hoon Lee', 'Vien Le', 'Alex Hiroto', 'Joseph Aldahl', 'Christian H Nenninger', 'Alyssa J Buckley', 'Robert Cardiff', 'Sungyong You', 'Zijie Sun']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nat Commun""","""['Stromal androgen signaling acts as tumor niches to drive prostatic basal epithelial progenitor-initiated oncogenesis.', 'The androgen receptor can signal through Wnt/beta-Catenin in prostate cancer cells as an adaptation mechanism to castration levels of androgens.', 'Androgen receptor with short polyglutamine tract preferably enhances Wnt/Î²-catenin-mediated prostatic tumorigenesis.', 'Multifaceted interaction between the androgen and Wnt signaling pathways and the implication for prostate cancer.', 'Roles and regulation of Wnt signaling and beta-catenin in prostate cancer.', 'Editorial: Molecular drivers of prostate cancer pathogenesis and therapy resistance.', 'Stromal androgen signaling acts as tumor niches to drive prostatic basal epithelial progenitor-initiated oncogenesis.']"""

Methods and materials:   2634 men with T1-T4N0M0 prostate cancer were treated with brachytherapy with or without neoadjuvant hormonal therapy or external beam radiation therapy. Five, 10, and 15- year BCRFS and CSS were estimated with Kaplan-Meier estimates with log rank. Multivariate analysis of survival was performed with Cox regression analysis.  Results:   Median age was 66, follow-up was 8.6 years, and prostate specific antigen was 6.9. Overall, 11.1% (n = 293) of patients experienced Phoenix BCR and 17.48% (n = 457) experienced AUA BCR. The rates of AUA BCR and Phoenix BCR were significantly different at 5 and 10-years but not at 15 years.

In contrast, less is known about the clinicopathologic spectrum of secondary solid tumors of the prostate of nonurothelial origin. This study evaluated a series of secondary nonurothelial solid tumors of the prostate diagnosed at 21 institutions. Eighty-five patients with a median age at diagnosis of 64 years were included. Sixty-two patients had clinically manifest disease (62/85, 73%), 10 were diagnosed incidentally (10/85, 12%), and 13 (13/85, 15%) had no detailed clinical data available about symptomatology at presentation. Among patients with clinically manifest disease, the most common symptoms and signs were lower urinary tract symptoms (either obstructive of irritative; 36/62, 58%), abdominal or pelvic pain or discomfort (16/62, 26%), and hematuria (12/62, 19%). Metastasis and direct invasion occurred at roughly similar frequencies (47% vs. 42%) in this series, and in 11% of the cases, the mechanism of spread to the prostate was unclear/uncertain. Overall, among tumors with confirmed sites of origin, the most common primary sites were gastrointestinal tract (53/85, 62%), lung (9/85, 11%), skin (6/85, 7%), and testis (4/85, 5%).

Feasibility of high-intensity resistance training sessions in cancer survivors. J Strength Cond Res 36(9): 2643-2652, 2022-Moderate-intensity resistance training (MIRT) is regarded as safe in cancer survivors (CS), but for high-intensity resistance training (HIRT), evidence is lacking. Hence, in the current exploratory analyses, single sessions of HIRT are compared with MIRT regarding safety and feasibility. Twenty-three of 24 included CS (14 breast and 10 prostate CS, 61.6 Â± 9.5 years, body mass index 27.0 Â± 4.3 kgÂ·m -2 , 6-52 weeks after end of primary therapy) started a 12-week resistance training (RT) with a daily undulating periodization model including HIRT (90% of 1 repetition maximum [1RM]) and MIRT (67% 1RM) sessions. Parameters of safety (adverse events [AEs] and training-related pain), feasibility (physical and mental exhaustion, sensation of effort, enjoyment, and dropout rate), and adherence were assessed. An alpha level of 0.05 was applied for analyses. Nineteen of 23 training starters (83%) completed all sessions. Fourteen minor AEs occurred. A significantly higher increase for physical exhaustion appeared in HIRT ( p < 0.001). For 18% (HIRT) and 19% (MIRT) of the sessions, training-related pain was reported with no significant difference between intensities. In total, 34% of HIRT and 35% of MIRT sessions were perceived as overstraining or partly overstraining with no significant difference between intensities, but enjoyment (median and quartiles on a 1-7 scale) was high for both (HIRT = 5 [5;6] and MIRT = 5 [4,6]). Our analysis indicates that HIRT sessions do not differ from MIRT sessions concerning safety or feasibility, but training-related pain should be monitored. RT protocols incorporating high-intensity training loads can be applied safely in breast and prostate CS.""","""['Kathrin SchlÃ¼ter', 'Justine Schneider', 'Friederike Rosenberger', 'Joachim Wiskemann']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Strength Cond Res""","""['The effects of resistance training with blood flow restriction on muscle strength, muscle hypertrophy and functionality in patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review with meta-analysis.', 'Effect of whole-body resistance training at different load intensities on circulating inflammatory biomarkers, body fat, muscular strength, and physical performance in postmenopausal women.', 'Effect of Resistance Training to Muscle Failure vs. Volitional Interruption at High- and Low-Intensities on Muscle Mass and Strength.', 'Short-term Periodization Models: Effects on Strength and Speed-strength Performance.', 'Dose-Response Relationships of Resistance Training in Healthy Old Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

Updated information is needed regarding the long-term incidence and risk of second primary cancer after radiotherapy vs nonradiotherapy treatments, which may help to inform discussions of risks and benefits for men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  Objective:   To assess the current incidence and risk of developing a second primary cancer after receipt of radiotherapy vs nonradiotherapy treatments for prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used the Veterans Affairs Corporate Data Warehouse to identify 154 514 male veterans 18 years and older who had localized prostate cancer (tumor stages T1-T3) diagnosed between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2015, and no cancer history. A total of 10 628 patients were excluded because of (1) incomplete treatment information for the year after diagnosis, (2) receipt of both radiotherapy and a surgical procedure in the year after diagnosis, (3) receipt of radiotherapy more than 1 year after diagnosis, (4) occurrence of second primary cancer or death within 1 year or less after diagnosis, (5) prostate-specific antigen value greater than 99 ng/mL within 6 months before diagnosis, or (6) no recorded Veterans Health Administration service after diagnosis. The remaining 143 886 patients included in the study had a median (IQR) follow-up of 9 (6-13) years. Data were analyzed from May 1, 2021, to May 22, 2022.  Main outcomes and measures:   Diagnosis of a second primary cancer more than 1 year after prostate cancer diagnosis.  Results:   Among 143 886 male veterans (median [IQR] age, 65 [60-71] years) with localized prostate cancer, 750 (0.5%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 389 (0.3%) were Asian, 37 796 (26.3%) were Black or African American, 933 (0.6%) were Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 91 091 (63.3%) were White, and 12 927 (9.0%) were of unknown race; 7299 patients (5.1%) were Hispanic or Latino, 128 796 (89.5%) were not Hispanic or Latino, and 7791 (5.4%) were of unknown ethnicity. A total of 52 886 patients (36.8%) received primary radiotherapy, and 91 000 (63.2%) did not. A second primary cancer more than 1 year after prostate cancer diagnosis was present in 4257 patients (3.0%), comprising 1955 patients (3.7%) in the radiotherapy cohort and 2302 patients (2.5%) in the nonradiotherapy cohort. In the multivariable analyses, patients in the radiotherapy cohort had a higher risk of second primary cancer compared with those in the nonradiotherapy cohort at years 1 to 5 after diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.13-1.37; P < .001), with higher adjusted HRs in the subsequent 15 years (years 5-10: 1.50 [95% CI, 1.36-1.65; P < .001]; years 10-15: 1.59 [95% CI, 1.37-1.84; P < .001]; years 15-20: 1.47 [95% CI, 1.08-2.01; P = .02).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, patients with prostate cancer who received radiotherapy were more likely to develop a second primary cancer than patients who did not receive radiotherapy, with increased risk over time. Although the incidence and risk of developing a second primary cancer were low, it is important to discuss the risk with patients during shared decision-making about prostate cancer treatment options.""","""['Hilary P Bagshaw', 'Katherine D Arnow', 'Amber W Trickey', 'John T Leppert', 'Sherry M Wren', 'Arden M Morris']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Association of Bone Mineral Density Testing With Risk of Major Osteoporotic Fractures Among Older Men Receiving Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Treat Localized or Regional Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison by Race of Conservative Management for Low-Risk and Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancers in Veterans From 2004 to 2018.', 'Risk of subsequent primary cancers after carbon ion radiotherapy, photon radiotherapy, or surgery for localised prostate cancer: a propensity score-weighted, retrospective, cohort study.', 'Variations in Age-Adjusted Prostate Cancer Incidence Rates by Race and Ethnicity After Changes in Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening Recommendation.', 'Second malignancies after radiotherapy for prostate cancer: systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Characteristics and classification of first primary cancer patients with second primary cancer: a population-based cohort study.', 'Neurogenesis manifestations of solid tumor and tracer imaging studies: a narrative review.', 'Ultra-Hypofractionated Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: Clinical Outcomes, Patterns of Recurrence, Feasibility of Definitive Salvage Treatment, and Competing Oncological Risk.']"""

There are few studies of HRQoL in long-term PCa survivors of African ancestry from low- and middle-income countries. We examined the effect of PCa treatment on HRQoL of Jamaican PCa survivors compared with cancer-free controls and explored the effect of demographic and clinical factors on these outcomes.  Methods:   PCa survivors (n = 64) treated with and without ADT along with PCa-free controls (n = 88) from a case-control study of 10 years post enrolment. HRQoL was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (EORTC-QLQ-C30). Effects of demographic and clinical variables on HRQoL on PCa and type of therapy were evaluated in multivariable linear regression models.  Results:   HRQoL of PCa survivors (overall and by treatment group) indicated a high quality of life, comparable to PCa-free men. However, ADT-treated survivors had lower physical functioning that was of small clinical relevance compared with those not on ADT. Symptom burden scores of PCa survivors and controls were similar excluding fatigue and dyspnoea which were highest in men on ADT and controls. In multivariable models, PCa was not an important determinant of overall HRQoL, functioning or symptom burdens. Underlying medical conditions and marital status were the main contributors to HRQoL in PCa survivors.  Conclusion:   PCa cancer status was not an independent determinant of long-term HRQoL in Jamaican men. Interventions addressing social factors and comorbid illnesses could improve HRQOL in long-term PCa survivors.""","""['Maria D Jackson', 'Evelyn Walker', 'Marshall K Tulloch-Reid']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Qual Life Res""","""['Long-term health-related quality of life of prostate cancer survivors varies by primary treatment.

The most recently examined complete blood count values in the 1-month period before treatment were used for calculating PIV. The relationship between overall survival (OS) and PIV was evaluated by multivariate analysis. By using PIV and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels which had shown survival effect at multivariate analysis, PIV-LDH combined score was established.  Results:   A total of 114 patients were included in this study. At the median follow-up of 34.6 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 32.4-36.8), the median OS was 21 months (95% CI: 17.6-21.3). The median OS in the low-PIV group was significantly higher than in the high-PIV group (34.4 months (95% CI: 21.3-47.5) vs. 14.3 months (95% CI: 10.0-18.7), p < 0.001). In the multivariate analysis for OS, high PIV (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.11-3.13, p = 0.018) and LDH value 1.5 times the upper limit of normal and above (HR: 3.65 95%, CI: 1.86-7.16, p < 0.001) were associated with shorter OS. When survival analysis was performed according to the PIV-LDH combined score, the median OS was 34.4 months (95% CI: 22.2-46.6) in the low-risk group, 17.7 months (95% CI: 11.7-23.6) in the intermediate-risk group, and 8.4 months (95% CI: 5.1-11.7) in the high-risk group (p < 0.001).

Recent studies have demonstrated the anticancer property of EF, but the active compounds of EF against prostate cancer and its underlying mechanism remain unknown. In this study, a network pharmacology-based approach was used to explore the multiple ingredients and targets of EF. Through protein-protein interaction (PPI), Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses, the potential targets and corresponding ingredients of EF against prostate cancer cells were obtained. CCK8 and colony formation assays were performed to evaluate the antiproliferative effect of the active compounds on DU145 cells. Cell cycle analysis, Annexin V-FITC/PI staining assay, and Hoechst 33258 staining assay were used to explore the way of evodiamine-induced cell death. The capacities of cell migration after evodiamine treatment were evaluated by wound-healing assay. PharmMapper database was used to predict the potential targets of evodiamine against cancer cell migration. Western blot assay was performed to investigate the signaling pathway through which evodiamine inhibits cell proliferation and migration. The binding of evodiamine to PI3K and AKT was verified by molecular docking. As a consequence, 24 active compounds and 141 corresponding targets were obtained through a network pharmacology-based approach. The results of PPI analysis, GO enrichment, and KEGG pathway enrichment indicated that molecules in the PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway were the potential targets of EF against prostate cancer, and evodiamine was the potential active compound. In vitro study demonstrated that evodiamine displays antiproliferative effect on DU145 cells obviously. Evodiamine induces G2/M cell cycle arrest by Cdc25c/CDK1/cyclin B1 signaling. Additionally, evodiamine also promotes mitochondrial apoptosis and inhibits cell migration through PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling in DU145 cells. In conclusion, evodiamine is the active compound of EF to inhibit proliferation and migration of prostate cancer through PI3K/AKT/NF-ÎºB signaling pathway, indicating that evodiamine may serve as a potential lead drug for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Yuhe Lei', 'Meiching Chan', 'Haiyan Liu', 'Wenyu Lyu', 'Lei Chen', 'Yinqin Zhong', 'Hua Gan', 'Mei Wang', 'Ming Qi', 'Yu Guo', 'Junshan Liu', 'Enxin Zhang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['A network pharmacology approach and experimental validation to investigate the anticancer mechanism and potential active targets of ethanol extract of Wei-Tong-Xin against colorectal cancer through induction of apoptosis via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'Evodiamine induces extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells via the mitogen-activated protein kinase/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathways.', 'Erianin, the main active ingredient of Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl, inhibits precancerous lesions of gastric cancer (PLGC) through suppression of the HRAS-PI3K-AKT signaling pathway as revealed by network pharmacology and in vitro experimental verification.', 'New light on treatment of cervical cancer: Chinese medicine monomers can be effective for cervical cancer by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.', 'Tanshinone I: Pharmacological activities, molecular mechanisms against diseases and future perspectives.', 'Traditional Chinese medicine inhibits PD-1/PD-L1 axis to sensitize cancer immunotherapy: a literature review.']"""

However, the clinical efficacy of DC-based vaccines remains suboptimal, largely reflecting local and systemic immunosuppression at baseline. An autologous DC-based vaccine (DCVAC) has recently been shown to improve progression-free survival and overall survival in randomized clinical trials enrolling patients with lung cancer (SLU01, NCT02470468) or ovarian carcinoma (SOV01, NCT02107937), but not metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (SP005, NCT02111577), despite a good safety profile across all cohorts. We performed biomolecular and cytofluorometric analyses on peripheral blood samples collected prior to immunotherapy from 1000 patients enrolled in these trials, with the objective of identifying immunological biomarkers that may improve the clinical management of DCVAC-treated patients. Gene signatures reflecting adaptive immunity and T cell activation were associated with favorable disease outcomes and responses to DCVAC in patients with prostate and lung cancer, but not ovarian carcinoma. By contrast, the clinical benefits of DCVAC were more pronounced among patients with ovarian carcinoma exhibiting reduced expression of T cell-associated genes, especially those linked to TH2-like signature and immunosuppressive regulatory T (TREG) cells. Clinical responses to DCVAC were accompanied by signs of antitumor immunity in the peripheral blood. Our findings suggest that circulating signatures of antitumor immunity may provide a useful tool for monitoring the potency of autologous DC-based immunotherapy.""","""['Michal Hensler', 'Jana Rakova', 'Lenka Kasikova', 'Tereza Lanickova', 'Josef Pasulka', 'Peter Holicek', 'Marek Hraska', 'Tereza Hrnciarova', 'Pavla Kadlecova', 'Andreu Schoenenberger', 'Klara Sochorova', 'Daniela Rozkova', 'Ludek Sojka', 'Jana Drozenova', 'Jan Laco', 'Rudolf Horvath', 'Michal Podrazil', 'Guo Hongyan', 'Tomas Brtnicky', 'Michal J Halaska', 'Lukas Rob', 'Ales Ryska', 'An Coosemans', 'Ignace Vergote', 'Abhishek D Garg', 'David Cibula', 'Jirina Bartunkova', 'Radek Spisek', 'Jitka Fucikova']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['An Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine Promotes Anticancer Immunity in Patients with Ovarian Cancer with Low Mutational Burden and Cold Tumors.', 'Safety and efficacy of dendritic cell-based immunotherapy DCVAC/OvCa added to first-line chemotherapy (carboplatin plus paclitaxel) for epithelial ovarian cancer: a phase 2, open-label, multicenter, randomized trial.', 'Dendritic Cells Loaded with Heat Shock-Conditioned Ovarian Epithelial Carcinoma Cell Lysates Elicit T Cell-Dependent Antitumor Immune Responses In Vitro.', 'Active cellular immunotherapy of ovarian cancer using dendritic cells.', 'The clinical application of cancer immunotherapy based on naturally circulating dendritic cells.', 'Trial watch: chemotherapy-induced immunogenic cell death in oncology.', 'Targeted therapy and immunotherapy: Diamonds in the rough in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'The Interface of Tumour-Associated Macrophages with Dying Cancer Cells in Immuno-Oncology.', 'Mast Cells and Dendritic Cells as Cellular Immune Checkpoints in Immunotherapy of Solid Tumors.', 'Immunology of cell death in cancer and infection.']"""

The most common method used in diagnosing prostate cancer is the microscopic observation of stained biopsies by a pathologist and the Gleason score of the tissue microarray images. However, scoring prostate cancer tissue microarrays by pathologists using Gleason mode under many tissue microarray images is time-consuming, susceptible to subjective factors between different observers, and has low reproducibility. We have used the two most common technologies, deep learning, and computer vision, in this research, as the development of deep learning and computer vision has made pathology computer-aided diagnosis systems more objective and repeatable. Furthermore, the U-Net network, which is used in our study, is the most extensively used network in medical image segmentation. Unlike the classifiers used in previous studies, a region segmentation model based on an improved U-Net network is proposed in our research, which fuses deep and shallow layers through densely connected blocks. At the same time, the features of each scale are supervised. As an outcome of the research, the network parameters can be reduced, the computational efficiency can be improved, and the method's effectiveness is verified on a fully annotated dataset.""","""['Shobha Tyagi', 'Neha Tyagi', 'Amarendranath Choudhury', 'Gauri Gupta', 'Musaddak Maher Abdul Zahra', 'Saima Ahmed Rahin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biomed Res Int""","""['WeGleNet: A weakly-supervised convolutional neural network for the semantic segmentation of Gleason grades in prostate histology images.', 'Going deeper through the Gleason scoring scale: An automatic end-to-end system for histology prostate grading and cribriform pattern detection.', 'Combining weakly and strongly supervised learning improves strong supervision in Gleason pattern classification.', 'Computer-Aided Detection and diagnosis for prostate cancer based on mono and multi-parametric MRI: a review.', 'Multi-scale brain tumor segmentation combined with deep supervision.', 'The Roles of Tumor-Associated Macrophages in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Screening has been debated but remains controversial and, in most countries, organized population-based screening does not exist. The aim of this study was to describe men's experiences of receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis after opportunistic screening.  Methods:   This study is a secondary analysis from interviews with 17 men (aged 56-80 years) who had undergone curative treatment for prostate cancer. Data were collected in an urban region of Sweden through interviews conducted face to face or by telephone. An inductive content analysis was used with Consolidated criteria for Reporting Qualitative research as a reporting checklist.  Results:   Two main categories were identified. Screening is a lifesaver enclosed by ethical dilemmas reflects how men considered screening as a lifesaving test. Testing was surrounded by injustice and an eagerness to encourage other men to undergo screening. Facing challenges during diagnosis reflects the men's experiences of being in an unknown field yet expected to engage in decision-making concerning appropriate treatment. Receiving the diagnosis rendered mixed emotions about having a cancer disease, that the treatment could cause lifelong symptom distress and the men described being hesitant to talk about their diagnosis.  Conclusions:   The findings highlight men's opinions about screening and that the lack of routine screening represents injustice. The men considered this as an ethical question of lifesaving justice, while stakeholders may argue that screening could lead to unnecessary suffering and overtreatment. Men do not always talk openly about their diagnosis, linked to the fact that it concerns intimate areas. It is important to balance the information in relation to shared decision-making regarding treatment. Health care professionals have an ethical responsibility to support and coach the patient in their decision.  Patient or public contribution:   This study was based on interviews with men who had experienced a diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Linda Gellerstedt', 'Ann Langius-EklÃ¶f', 'Nazmije Kelmendi', 'Kay Sundberg', 'Ãsa G Craftman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Health Expect""","""[""A qualitative meta-synthesis examining the role of women in African American men's prostate cancer screening and treatment decision making."", ""Gay men's experiences of sexual changes after prostate cancer treatment-a qualitative study in Sweden."", ""Men's experiences of antenatal screening: a metasynthesis of the qualitative research."", ""Delivering the unexpected-Information needs for PSA screening from Men's perspective: A qualitative study."", ""Men's perspectives of prostate cancer screening: A systematic review of qualitative studies.""]"""

The glycosylation enzyme EDEM3 is controlled by androgen signalling and is important for prostate cancer viability. EDEM3 is a mannosidase that trims mannose from mis-folded glycoproteins, tagging them for degradation through endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Here, we find that EDEM3 is upregulated in prostate cancer, and this is linked to poorer disease-free survival. Depletion of EDEM3 from prostate cancer cells induces an ER stress transcriptomic signature, and EDEM3 overexpression is cyto-protective against ER stressors. EDEM3 expression also positively correlates with genes involved in the unfolded protein response in prostate cancer patients, and its expression can be induced through exposure to radiation. Importantly, the overexpression of EDEM3 promotes radio-resistance in prostate cancer cells and radio-resistance can be reduced through depletion of EDEM3. Our data thus implicate increased levels of EDEM3 with a role in prostate cancer pathology and reveal a new therapeutic opportunity to sensitise prostate tumours to radiotherapy.""","""['Emma Scott', 'Rebecca Garnham', 'Kathleen Cheung', 'Adam Duxfield', 'David J Elliott', 'Jennifer Munkley']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['ER-resident protein 46 (ERp46) triggers the mannose-trimming activity of ER degradation-enhancing Î±-mannosidase-like protein 3 (EDEM3).', 'EDEM3, a soluble EDEM homolog, enhances glycoprotein endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and mannose trimming.', 'EDEM3 Domains Cooperate to Perform Its Overall Cell Functioning.', 'Glycoprotein folding and the role of EDEM1, EDEM2 and EDEM3 in degradation of folding-defective glycoproteins.', 'Glycosylation is a global target for androgen control in prostate cancer cells.', 'Upregulation of GALNT7 in prostate cancer modifies O-glycosylation and promotes tumour growth.']"""

This study aims to describe the prevalence of probable anxiety and depression before PCa treatments and after one year and to identify sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with these outcomes. Between February 2018 and March 2020, 292 patients recently diagnosed with PCa were recruited at the Instituto PortuguÃªs de Oncologia-Porto. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to define probable anxiety and depression (cutoff = 11). The prevalence of probable anxiety remained stable from baseline to one year (7.8% vs. 8.5%, p = 0.866) while there was an increase in probable depression (3.1% vs. 6.8%, p = 0.012). After one year, probable depression persisted in 55.6% of patients with probable depression at baseline and 47.8% of those with probable anxiety at the first assessment had normal anxiety scores. At baseline, anxiety was more frequent among dwellers in rural areas (adjusted odds ratio-aOR, 95%CI: 2.80, 0.91-8.58) and less frequent in patients with body mass index 25-29.9 kg/m2 (aOR, 95%CI: 0.33, 0.12-0.91) compared to 18.5-24.9 Kg/m2, while those living alone had higher odds of depression (aOR, 95%CI: 6.35, 1.43-28.30).
