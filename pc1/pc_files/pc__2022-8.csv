Recently, accumulating evidence has shown the expression of METTL3 in cytoplasm, but its function is not fully understood. Here we demonstrated an m6A-independent mechanism for METTL3 to promote tumour progression. In gastric cancer, METTL3 could not only facilitate cancer progression via m6A modification, but also bind to numerous non-m6A-modified mRNAs, suggesting an unexpected role of METTL3. Mechanistically, cytoplasm-anchored METTL3 interacted with PABPC1 to stabilize its association with cap-binding complex eIF4F, which preferentially promoted the translation of epigenetic factors without m6A modification. Clinical investigation showed that cytoplasmic distributed METTL3 was highly correlated with gastric cancer progression, and this finding could be expanded to prostate cancer. Therefore, the cytoplasmic METTL3 enhances the translation of epigenetic mRNAs, thus serving as an oncogenic driver in cancer progression, and METTL3 subcellular distribution can assist diagnosis and predict prognosis for patients with cancer.""","""['Xueju Wei#', 'Yue Huo#', 'Jingnan Pi#', 'Yufeng Gao#', 'Shuan Rao#', 'Manman He#', 'Qinglv Wei', 'Peng Song', 'Yiying Chen', 'Dongxu Lu', 'Wei Song', 'Junbo Liang', 'Lingjie Xu', 'Haixia Wang', 'Guolin Hong', 'Yuehong Guo', 'Yanmin Si', 'Jiayue Xu', 'Xiaoshuang Wang', 'Yanni Ma', 'Shuyang Yu', 'Dongling Zou', 'Jing Jin', 'Fang Wang', 'Jia Yu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nat Cell Biol""","""['Localization-dictated function for METTL3.', 'METTL3 Promotes Tumorigenesis and Metastasis through BMI1 m6A Methylation in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.', 'Dysregulated N6-methyladenosine\xa0methylation writer METTL3 contributes to the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer.', 'Dynamic m6A mRNA methylation reveals the role of METTL3-m6A-CDCP1 signaling axis in chemical carcinogenesis.', 'METTL3 plays a crucial function in multiple biological processes.', 'Multifaceted Roles of the N6-Methyladenosine RNA Methyltransferase METTL3 in Cancer and Immune Microenvironment.', 'Methyltransferase-like proteins in cancer biology and potential therapeutic targeting.', 'Roles and implications of mRNA N6 -methyladenosine in cancer.', 'A novel N6-Deoxyadenine methyltransferase METL-9 modulates C. elegans immunity via dichotomous mechanisms.', 'The interplay between\xa0N6-methyladenosine and\xa0precancerous liver disease: molecular functions and\xa0mechanisms.', 'The roles and implications of RNA m6A modification in cancer.']"""

Currently, most CRISPR-based diagnostics rely on target preamplification to reach sufficient sensitivity for clinical applications. This limits quantification capability and adds complexity to the reaction chemistry. Here we show the combination of a CRISPR-Cas-based reaction with a nanozyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which allows for the quantitative and colorimetric readout of Cas13-mediated RNA detection through catalytic metallic nanoparticles at room temperature (CrisprZyme). We demonstrate that CrisprZyme is easily adaptable to a lateral-flow-based readout and different Cas enzymes and enables the sensing of non-coding RNAs including microRNAs, long non-coding RNAs and circular RNAs. We utilize this platform to identify patients with acute myocardial infarction and to monitor cellular differentiation in vitro and in tissue biopsies from prostate cancer patients.

The study aims to screen out the hub genes of combination therapy and to explore their association with the pathogenesis and prognosis of PCa.  Methods:   Gene expressions were quantified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Altered biological function, pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), protein-protein interaction network, the filtering of hub genes, gene co-expression and the pathogenesis and prognosis were revealed by bioinformatics analysis. The correlation between hub gene expression and patient survival was validated by Kaplan-Meier. The effects of silent DNA replication and sister chromatid cohesion 1 (siDSCC1) combined with Lipitor and aspirin on DSCC1 expression, viability, invasion and migration of PCa cells were detected by qRT-PCR, Wound healing and transwell assays.  Results:   157 overlapped DEGs involved in FoxO, PI3K-Akt and p53 signaling pathways were identified. Ten hub genes (NEIL3, CDC7, DSCC1, CDC25C, PRIM1, MCM10, FBXO5, DTL, SERPINE1, EXO1) were verified to be correlated with the pathology and prognosis of PCa. DSCC1 silencing not only inhibited the viability, migration and invasion of PCa cells, but also strengthened the suppressing effects of Lipitor and aspirin alone or in combination on PCa cells.

However, Black men have been underrepresented in clinical trials of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; thus, there is a lack of data to guide screening recommendations for this population.  Objective:   To assess whether PSA screening is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) among non-Hispanic Black men.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used data from the US Veterans Health Administration Informatics and Computing Infrastructure for men aged 55 to 69 years who self-identified as non-Hispanic Black or non-Hispanic White and were diagnosed with intermediate-, high-, or very high-risk prostate cancer from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to March 2022.  Exposures:   Prostate-specific antigen screening rate, defined as the percentage of years in which PSA screening was conducted during the 5 years before diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was risk of PCSM among Black men and White men. The association between PSA screening and risk of PCSM was assessed using Fine-Gray regression analysis. Risk of PCSM was also assessed categorically among patients classified as having no prior PSA screening, some screening (less than annual), or annual screening in the 5 years before diagnosis.  Results:   The study included 45 834 veterans (mean [SD] age, 62.7 [3.8] years), of whom 14 310 (31%) were non-Hispanic Black men and 31 524 (69%) were non-Hispanic White men. The PSA screening rate was associated with a lower risk of PCSM among Black men (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.56; 95% CI, 0.41-0.76; P = .001) and White men (sHR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46-0.75; P = .001). On subset analysis, annual screening (vs some screening) was associated with a significant reduction in risk of PCSM among Black men (sHR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92; P = .02) but not among White men (sHR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.11; P = .35).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, PSA screening was associated with reduced risk of PCSM among non-Hispanic Black men and non-Hispanic White men. Annual screening was associated with reduced risk of PCSM among Black men but not among White men, suggesting that annual screening may be particularly important for Black men.

Methods:   Between January 2019 and January 2020, seventy-two consecutive patients (55 men, 17 women, median age = 66 years) with solid (prostate, breast, neuroendocrine) cancers at high risk of metastasis or proven multiple myeloma (MM) prospectively underwent a WB-MRI examination including coronal T1, STIR, T2 Dixon and axial diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. Two radiologists independently assessed the combination of T1+STIR sequences and the fat+water reconstructions from the T2 Dixon sequence. The reference standard was established by consensus reading of WB-MRI and concurrent imaging available at baseline and at 6 months. Repeatability and reproducibility of MRI scores (presence and semi-quantitative count of lesions), image quality (SNR: signal-to-noise, CNR: contrast-to-noise, CRR: contrast-to-reference ratios), and diagnostic characteristics (Se: sensitivity, Sp: specificity, Acc: accuracy) were assessed per-skeletal region and per-patient.  Results:   Repeatability and reproducibility were at least good regardless of the score, region, and protocol (0.67 ≤ AC1 ≤ 0.98). CRR was higher on T2 Dixon fat compared to T1 (p < 0.0001) and on T2 Dixon water compared to STIR (p = 0.0128). In the per-patient analysis, Acc of the T2 Dixon fat+water was higher than that of T1+STIR for the senior reader (Acc = +0.027 [+0.025; +0.029], p < 0.0001) and lower for the junior reader (Acc = -0.029 [-0.031; -0.027], p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   A single T2 Dixon sequence with fat+water reconstructions offers similar reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy as the recommended combination of T1+STIR sequences and can be used for skeletal screening in oncology, allowing significant time-saving.  Key points:   • Replacement of the standard anatomic T1 + STIR WB-MRI protocol by a single T2 Dixon sequence drastically shortens the examination time without loss of diagnostic accuracy. • A protocol based on fat + water reconstructions from a single T2 Dixon sequence offers similar inter-reader agreement and a higher contrast-to-reference ratio for detecting lesions compared to the standard T1 + STIR protocol. • Differences in the accuracy between the two protocols are marginal (+ 3% in favor of the T2 Dixon with the senior reader; -3% against the T2 Dixon with the junior reader).""","""['Ophelye Chiabai', 'Sandy Van Nieuwenhove', 'Marie-Christiane Vekemans', 'Bertrand Tombal', 'Frank Peeters', 'Joris Wuts', 'Perrine Triqueneaux', 'Patrick Omoumi', 'Thomas Kirchgesner', 'Nicolas Michoux', 'Frédéric E Lecouvet']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Shortening the acquisition time of whole-body MRI: 3D T1 gradient echo Dixon vs fast spin echo for metastatic screening in prostate cancer.', 'Conspicuity of bone metastases on fast Dixon-based multisequence whole-body MRI: clinical utility per sequence.', 'Whole-body MRI to assess bone involvement in prostate cancer and multiple myeloma: comparison of the diagnostic accuracies of the T1, short tau inversion recovery (STIR), and high b-values diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences.', 'Clinical Application and Limitations of Myeloma Response Assessment and Diagnosis System (MY-RADS).', 'Fast magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in children: the sub-10-min unenhanced scan.', 'Current state-of-the-art imaging techniques in the domain of whole-body MRI and its advantages over other whole-body PET in different musculoskeletal diseases.', 'Morphological assessment of cartilage and osteoarthritis in clinical practice and research: Intermediate-weighted fat-suppressed sequences and beyond.', 'Advances in Bone Marrow Imaging: Strengths and Limitations from a Clinical Perspective.']"""

Methods:   A Markov model, adapted from the one established in Finland was conducted for the cost-effectiveness analysis of degarelix and leuprorelin for Pca treatment. The main data were derived from global phase III clinical trials of degarelix (CS21), published study and expert surveys. Outcomes, utility and costs of prostate cancer patients were calculated on a 30-year time horizon. The CS21 study based population of intention-to-treat (ITT) population and three scenarios were modeled. Taking three times of the Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (242,928 yuan, 2021) as the acceptable threshold for cost-effectiveness. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed on key parameters, including transition probabilities, costs, utility, and discount rate to test the robustness of the model.  Results:   Base case analysis for ITT population revealed that total costs of degarelix and leuprorelin were 566,226 yuan and 489,693 yuan, while the total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 5.19 and 4.51 during the 30-year time horizon, resulting an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 112,674 yuan/QALY which was 1.39 times the GDP per capita, lower than willingness-to-pay level of three times the GDP per capita. The results for scenario analyses revealed that compared to leuprorelin, degarelix for Pca treatment in China was cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that the model was most sensitive to price of 80 mg degarelix, utility of 1st-line therapy, hazard ratio of PSA recurrence, price of 3.75 mg leuprorelin, response rate of docetaxel per cycle, and discount rate of cost. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, compared to leuprorelin, the probability of degarelix to be cost-effective was 53 and 81% for willingness-to-pay threshold of one and three times the GDP per capita.

In recent years, the mainstream segmentation method for the prostate has been converted to convolutional neural networks. However, owing to the complexity of the tissue structure in MR images and the limitations of existing methods in spatial context modeling, the segmentation performance should be improved further.  Methods:   In this study, we proposed a novel 3D pyramid pool Unet that benefits from the pyramid pooling structure embedded in the skip connection (SC) and the deep supervision (DS) in the up-sampling of the 3D Unet. The parallel SC of the conventional 3D Unet network causes low-resolution information to be sent to the feature map repeatedly, resulting in blurred image features. To overcome the shortcomings of the conventional 3D Unet, we merge each decoder layer with the feature map of the same scale as the encoder and the smaller scale feature map of the pyramid pooling encoder. This SC combines the low-level details and high-level semantics at two different levels of feature maps. In addition, pyramid pooling performs multifaceted feature extraction on each image behind the convolutional layer, and DS learns hierarchical representations from comprehensive aggregated feature maps, which can improve the accuracy of the task.  Results:   Experiments on 3D prostate MR images of 78 patients demonstrated that our results were highly correlated with expert manual segmentation. The average relative volume difference and Dice similarity coefficient of the prostate volume area were 2.32% and 91.03%, respectively.

Although upgrading of PCa Grade Group (GG) is often described, the occurrence and prognostic implications of downgrading PCa GG at the time of radical prostatectomy (RP) is less understood. Our objective was to evaluate whether downgrading PCa GG at the time of RP was associated with future tumor behavior.  Methods:   The SEER database was searched from 2010 to 2017 and patients were included if they were assigned pathological grades on both Bx and RP specimen. Patients were stratified into Bx GG > RP GG and Bx GG ≤ RP GG groups, and tumor behavior after treatment was examined. Cox regression was used for the survival analysis.  Results:   Here, 99,835 patients were included in this study. A total of 18,516 (18.5%) patients encountered downgrading from Bx GG to RP GG. A downgrading of 1 grade occurred in 13,969 (75.4%) of these patients and of 2 or more grades occurred in 4547 (24.6%) patients. A history of higher Bx GG compared with RP GG increased the risk of cancer-specific mortality (CSM) for each given RP GG controlling for age, race, preop prostate-specific antigen level, percentage of positive biopsy cores, and pathologic TNM stages. Specifically, a history of high Bx GG conferred a 45% increased risk of CSM for any given RP GG (hazard ratio = 1.45 95% confidence interval = 1.16-1.82, p < 0.001).

The aim of our study was to explore the association of CgA levels and the risk of poorly differentiated prostate cancer (PCa) in men undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy (RRP).  Materials and methods:   From 2012 onwards, 335 consecutive men undergoing RRP for PCa at three centers in Italy were enrolled into a prospective database. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated before RRP. Blood samples were collected and tested for total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels and chromogranin A (CgA). We evaluated the association between serum levels of CgA and upstaging and upgrading using logistic regression analyses.  Results:   Median age and preoperative PSA levels were 65 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 60-69) and 7.2 ng/ml (IQR: 5.3-10.4), respectively. Median BMI was 26.1 kg/m2 (IQR: 24-29) with 56 (16%) obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ). Median CgA levels were 51 (39/71). Overall, 129/335 (38,5%) presented an upstaging, and 99/335 (30%) presented an upgrading. CgA was not a predictor of upstaging or upgrading on RP.

There is a strong public perception that male urinary symptoms is one of the key indicators of prostate cancer, and this continues to be part of messaging from national guidelines and media health campaigns. This narrative, however, is not based on evidence and may be seriously hampering efforts to encourage early presentation.  Discussion:   Anatomically, prostate cancer most often arises in the peripheral zone, while urinary symptoms result from compression of the urethra by prostatic enlargement more centrally. Biopsy studies show that mean prostate volume is actually lower in men found to have (early) prostate cancer compared to those with benign biopsies. This inverse relationship between prostate size and the probability of cancer is so strong that PSA density (PSA corrected for prostate volume) is known to be significantly more accurate in predicting a positive biopsy than PSA alone. Thus, this disconnect between scientific evidence and the current perception is very striking. There is also evidence that using symptoms for investigating possible cancer may lead to higher proportions of men presenting with locally advanced or metastatic disease compared to PSA testing or screening programmes. Concerns about overwhelming health care services if men are encouraged to get tested without symptoms may also be overstated, with recent newer approaches to reduce over-investigation and treatment. In this article, we explore the link between urinary symptoms and prostate cancer and propose that public and professional messaging needs to change.  Conclusion:   If rates of earlier diagnosis are to improve, we call for strong clear messaging that prostate cancer is a silent disease especially in the curable stages and men should come forward for testing regardless of whether or not they have symptoms. This should be done in parallel with other ongoing efforts to raise awareness including targeting men at highest risk due to racial ancestry or family history. While the current resurgence in interest and debate about prostate cancer screening is timely, change of this message by guideline bodies, charities and the media can be a first simple step to improving earlier presentation and hence cures rates.""","""['Vincent J Gnanapragasam', 'David Greenberg', 'Neil Burnet']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""['PSA testing for men at average risk of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer screening practices in a large, integrated health system: 2007-2014.', 'The absence of voiding symptoms in men with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration of ≥3.0 ng/mL is an independent risk factor for prostate cancer: results from the Gothenburg Randomized Screening Trial.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Advancements in PSA-based screening for prostate cancer.', 'Symptom appraisal and help seeking in males with symptoms of possible prostate cancer: a qualitative study with an ethnically diverse sample in London.', 'The androgen receptor-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera and other alternative therapeutic choices in overcoming the resistance to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.']"""

The role of comorbid conditions has been suggested as a potential contributory factor in this but issues of data comparability across jurisdictions has inhibited efforts to explore relationships. We use data from a single jurisdiction of the UK using data from - the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry (NICR), to examine the association between mortality (all-cause and cancer specific) and pre-existing cardiovascular diseases among patients with cancer.  Materials and methods:   All patients diagnosed with cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) between 2011 and 2014 were identified from Registry records. Those with a pre-existing diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases were identified by record linkage with patient hospital discharge data using ICD10 codes. Survival following diagnosis was examined using descriptive statistics and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Analyses examined all-cause mortality and cancer specific mortality for lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancer. As well as cardiovascular diseases, regression models controlled for age, gender (where appropriate), deprivation (as quintiles), stage at diagnosis and other comorbidities.  Results:   Almost 35,000 incident cancer cases were diagnosed during the study period of which approximately 23% had a prior heart condition. The pan-cancer hazard ratio for death in the presence of pre-existing cardiovascular diseases was 1.28 (95% CI: 1.18-1.40). All-cause and cancer specific mortality was higher for patients with cardiovascular diseases across lung, female breast, prostate and colorectal cancer groups after controlling for age, gender (where appropriate), deprivation (as quintiles), stage at diagnosis and other comorbidities.

Thus, this life-threatening disease demands a proactive treatment strategy. Andrographis paniculata (AP) is a promising candidate with various medicinal properties. However, the bioactivity of AP is influenced by its processing conditions especially the extraction solvent.  Objective:   In the present study, bioassay-guided screening technique was employed to identify the best AP extract in the management of MetS, PCa, and MetS-PCa co-disease in vitro.  Methods:   Five AP extracts by different solvent systems; APE1 (aqueous), APE2 (absolute methanol), APE3 (absolute ethanol), APE4 (40% methanol), and APE5 (60% ethanol) were screened through their phytochemical profile, in-vitro anti-cancer, anti-obese, and anti-hyperglycemic properties. The best extract was further tested for its potential in MetS-induced PCa progression.  Results:   APE2 contained the highest andrographolide (1.34 ± 0.05 mg/mL) and total phenolic content (8.85 ± 0.63 GAE/gDW). However, APE3 has the highest flavonoid content (11.52 ± 0.80 RE/gDW). APE2 was also a good scavenger of DPPH radicals (EC50 = 397.0 µg/mL). In cell-based assays, among all extracts, APE2 exhibited the highest antiproliferative activity (IC50 = 57.5 ± 11.8 µg/mL) on DU145 cancer cell line as well as on its migration activity. In in-vitro anti-obese study, all extracts significantly reduced lipid formation in 3T3-L1 cells. The highest insulin-sensitizing and -mimicking actions were exerted by both APE2 and APE3. Taken together, APE2 showed collectively good activity in the inhibition of PCa progression and MetS manifestation in vitro, compared to other extracts. Therefore, APE2 was further investigated for its potential to intervene DU145 progression induced with leptin (10-100 ng/mL) and adipocyte conditioned media (CM) (10% v/v). Interestingly, APE2 significantly diminished the progression of the cancer cell that has been pre-treated with leptin and CM through cell cycle arrest at S phase and induction of cell death.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, AP extracts rich with andrographolide has the potential to be used as an alternative to ameliorate PCa progression induced by factors highly expressed in MetS.""","""['Mohamad Khairul Hafiz Idris', 'Rosnani Hasham', 'Hassan Fahmi Ismail']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Daru""","""['Effect of andrographolide and deep eutectic solvent extracts of Andrographis paniculata on human coronavirus organ culture 43 (HCoV-OC43).', 'Ovicidal and larvicidal effects of extracts from leaves of Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.)

Conversely, high expression of AOC1 is significantly associated with reduced proliferation and migration in prostate cancer both in vitro and in vivo. We show that the anticancer effect of AOC1 is mediated by its action on spermidine which leads to the activation of reactive oxygen species and ferroptosis.

Accurate combined dosimetry remains elusive due to lack of registration between treatment plans and different biological effect. The current work proposes a method to convert physical dose to biological effective dose (BED) and spatially register the dose distributions for more accurate combined dosimetry.  Methods and materials:   A PSI phantom was CT scanned with and without seeds under rigid and deformed transformations. The resulting CTs were registered using image-based rigid registration (RI), fiducial-based rigid registration (RF), or b-spline deformable image registration (DIR) to determine which was most accurate. Physical EBRT and PSI dose distributions from a sample of 91 previously-treated combined-modality prostate cancer patients were converted to BED and registered using RI, RF, and DIR. Forty-eight (48) previously-treated patients whose PSI occurred before EBRT were included as a ""control"" group due to inherent registration. Dose-volume histogram (DVH) parameters were compared for RI, RF, DIR, DICOM, and scalar addition of DVH parameters using ANOVA or independent Student's t tests (α = 0.05).  Results:   In the phantom study, DIR was the most accurate registration algorithm, especially in the case of deformation. In the patient study, dosimetry from RI was significantly different than the other registration algorithms, including the control group. Dosimetry from RF and DIR were not significantly different from the control group or each other.  Conclusions:   Combined dosimetry with BED and image registration is feasible.

Multiple PARPi resistance mechanisms exist, most resulting in restoration of HRR and protection of stalled replication forks. ATR inhibition was highlighted as a unique approach to reverse both aspects of resistance. Recently, however, a PARPi/WEE1 inhibitor (WEE1i) combination demonstrated enhanced antitumor activity associated with the induction of replication stress, suggesting another approach to tackling PARPi resistance.  Experimental design:   We analyzed breast and ovarian patient-derived xenoimplant models resistant to PARPi to quantify WEE1i and ATR inhibitor (ATRi) responses as single agents and in combination with PARPi. Biomarker analysis was conducted at the genetic and protein level. Metabolite analysis by mass spectrometry and nucleoside rescue experiments ex vivo were also conducted in patient-derived models.  Results:   Although WEE1i response was linked to markers of replication stress, including STK11/RB1 and phospho-RPA, ATRi response associated with ATM mutation. When combined with olaparib, WEE1i could be differentiated from the ATRi/olaparib combination, providing distinct therapeutic strategies to overcome PARPi resistance by targeting the replication stress response. Mechanistically, WEE1i sensitivity was associated with shortage of the dNTP pool and a concomitant increase in replication stress.

Patients and methods:   This study evaluated the proportion of non-adherence in a 12-month follow-up period and the first 3 months to abiraterone (ABI) or enzalutamide (ENZ). In a prospective multicenter observational cohort study, patients with metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) aged ≥70 years receiving ABI or ENZ pre- or post-docetaxel were enrolled. Treatment monitoring included pill counting, a self-assessment questionnaire, and clinical diaries at each clinical visit. Non-adherence rates were based on proportions of missed/prescribed pills ratios by pill counting.  Results:   Overall, 234 patients were recruited with median age of 78 years (range, 73-82); 86 (37%) were treated with ABI, and 148 (63%) with ENZ. The median follow-up for adherence was seven monthly cycles (IQR: 4-12). The two cohorts were well balanced for baseline characteristics. The percentage of non-adherence by pill counting was slightly higher for ABI than ENZ (5.2% vs. 4.2%, P < .001). By self-reporting, patients on ENZ tended to report more frequently than those with ABI forgetfulness as the reason for missing events (42% vs. 17%, P < .001). A lower Geriatric G8 score correlated with non-adherence (P = .004). Overall survival (OS) was 48.8 months.

We present the results from our majority African-American cohort of men in an equal access setting over a 5-year follow-up period.  Patients and methods:   All patients who elected AS for prostate cancer at the Southeast Louisiana Veterans Health Care System are entered into a prospectively managed observational database. Patients were divided into groups based on self-reported race. Grade group progression was defined as pathologic upgrading above International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group 1 disease on subsequent biopsies following diagnostic biopsy. All tests were 2 sided using a significance of .05.  Results:   A total of 228 men met inclusion criteria in the study, including 154 non-Hispanic African American and 74 non-Hispanic Caucasian American men, with a median follow-up of 5 years from the initiation of AS. Race was not predictive of Gleason grade progression, AS discontinuation, or biochemical recurrence on Cox multivariate analysis (HR = 1.01, 0.94, 0.85, P = .96, .79, .81, respectively). On Kaplan-Meier analysis at 5 years, African-American progression-free, AS discontinuation free, and overall survival probability was comparable to their Caucasian American counterparts (P > .05 for all).

Using XGBoost adapted to long-term disease progression, we developed a predictive model for 118 788 patients with localized prostate cancer at diagnosis from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Our model accounted for patient censoring. Harrell's c-index for our model using only features available at the time of diagnosis was 0.757 95% confidence interval [0.756, 0.757]. Our results show that machine learning methods like XGBoost can be adapted to use accelerated failure time (AFT) with censoring to model long-term risk of disease progression.

Methods:   We retrospectively collected 307 men that underwent initial biopsy from October 2015 to January 2022 in Cohort 1 (The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University). External cohort (Cohort 2, Kunshan Hospital) included 109 men that met our criteria from July 2016 to June 2021. By Slicer-3D Software, the volume of all lesions was divided into two subgroups (PI-RADS v2.1 = 3a and 3b). Logistic regression analysis was performed to screen for variables and construct nomogram by analyzing clinical data from Cohort 1. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis, calibration plot and decision curve analysis (DCA) were plotted to validate the nomogram in external cohort.  Results:   A total of 70 (22.8%) patients was diagnosed with prostate cancer in Institution 1. Among them, 34 (11.1%) had clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Age, prostate-specific antigen density, digital rectal examination, PI-RADS v2.1 = 3 subgroups (3a and 3b) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC, <750 mm2 /s) were predictive factors for prostate cancer (PCa) and csPCa. High area under the curve of the nomogram was found in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 for PCa (0.857 vs. 0.850) and for csPCa (0.896 vs. 0.893). Calibration curves showed excellent agreement between the predicted probability and actual risk for the models in internal and external validation. The DCA demonstrated net benefit of our nomogram.  Conclusion:   Until now, this is the first nomogram that predicts PCa and csPCa in biopsy-naïve patients with PSA <10 ng/ml and PI-RADS v2.1 = 3 lesions.

However, the recommended testosterone cut-off of 1.7 nmol/L (50 ng/dL) to define adequate castration is based on consensus and not validated for the automated immunoassays (AIA) used in today's medical laboratories. Furthermore, appropriate population intervals have not been determined by a state-of-the-art assay. We investigated the analytical suitability of this cut-off and the accuracy of the present-day AIAs for testosterone analysis in castrated PCa patients.  Methods:   Leftover serum from 120 PCa patients castrated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists was analysed for testosterone by five methods: Architect i2000 (Abbott), Access (Beckman), Cobas 6000 (Roche), Atellica (Siemens), LC-MS/MS. For all assays, the castration 95th, 97.5th and 99th percentile upper limits were determined. Furthermore, Passing-Bablok regression, mean bias and Spearman's correlation coefficients were compared to the LC-MS/MS method and total error based on biological variation.  Results:   All castration upper limits, ranging from 0.472 nmol/L (LC-MS/MS) to 1.25 nmol/L (Access) (95% percentile), were significantly lower than the current castration cut-off (1.7 nmol/L). Slopes of Passing-Bablok regressions comparing the AIA with the LC-MS/MS method ranged from 1.4 (Cobas and Atellica) to 3.8 (Access). The Architect showed the highest correlation with LC-MS/MS (ρ=0.58). All AIA failed to meet the desirable total error criterion.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that a lower general testosterone castration cut-off may be more appropriate in evaluating the adequacy of castration in PCa and that present-day AIA lack analytical accuracy to quantify testosterone levels in castrated PCa.""","""['Lennart Jan van Winden', 'Eef G W M Lentjes', 'Ayse Y Demir', 'Henk J Huijgen', 'Andries Marinus Bergman', 'Henk G van der Poel', 'Huub H van Rossum']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['Serum testosterone measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is an independent predictor of response to castration in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Accuracy of serum luteinizing hormone and serum testosterone measurements to assess the efficacy of medical castration in prostate cancer patients.', 'Comparison of four different immunoassays and a rapid isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay for serum folate.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Subgroup analyses revealed invariably higher CSM after LTD versus PN in patients with tumor size ≤3 cm (10-yr CSM 7.2% vs 5.3%, multivariable HR: 1.47, p < 0.001) and in patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm (10-yr CSM 11.4% vs 6.1%, multivariable HR: 1.72, p < 0.001). Lack of information regarding earlier cancer controls, retreatment, tumor location within the kidney, and type of surgery represented limitations.  Conclusions:   In T1a RCC patients, LTD is invariably associated with higher CSM relative to PN, even after adjustment for OCM and all available patient and tumor characteristics, and regardless of tumor size considerations. However, the magnitude of CSM disadvantage was more pronounced in LTD patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm than in those with tumor size ≤3 cm.  Patient summary:   In patients with small renal masses, we observed higher cancer-specific death rates for local tumor destruction (LTD) than for partial nephrectomy. The LTD disadvantage was more pronounced for patients with tumor size 3.1-4 cm, but was also present in those with tumor size ≤3 cm.""","""['Gabriele Sorce', 'Benedikt Hoeh', 'Lukas Hohenhorst', 'Andrea Panunzio', 'Stefano Tappero', 'Zhe Tian', 'Andrea Kokorovic', 'Alessandro Larcher', 'Umberto Capitanio', 'Derya Tilki', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Alessandro Antonelli', 'Fred Saad', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['Comparison of Partial Versus Radical Nephrectomy Effect on Other-cause Mortality, Cancer-specific Mortality, and 30-day Mortality in Patients Older Than 75 Years.', 'Assessment of local tumor ablation and non-interventional management versus partial nephrectomy in T1a renal cell carcinoma.', 'A non-cancer-related survival benefit is associated with partial nephrectomy.', 'Partial Nephrectomy versus Thermal Ablation for Clinical Stage T1 Renal Masses: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of More than 3,900 Patients.', 'Differential efficacy of ablation therapy versus partial nephrectomy between clinical T1a and T1b renal tumors: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Contemporary vs historical survival rates in metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma according to race/ethnicity.']"""

We investigated whether focal HIFU (fHIFU) yields oncologic advantages over AS for low-risk PCa.  Materials and methods:   We included 2 non-randomized prospective series of 132 (fHIFU) and 421 (AS) consecutive patients diagnosed with ISUP 1 PCa between 2008 and 2018. A matched pair analysis was performed to decrease potential bias. Study main outcomes were freedom from radical treatment (RT) or androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), treatment-free survival (TFS), time to metastasis, and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Median fHIFU follow-up was 50 months (interquartile range, 29-84 months). Among matched variables, no major differences were recorded except for AS having more suspicious digital rectal examination findings (P = .0074) and recent enrollment year (P = .0005). Five-year intervention-free survival from RT or ADT was higher for the fHIFU cohort (67.4% vs. 53.8%; P = .0158). Time to treatment was approximately 10 months shorter for AS than for fHIFU (time to RT, P = .0363; time to RT or ADT, P = .0156; time to any treatment, P = .0319). No differences were found in any-TFS (fHIFU, 61.4% vs. AS, 53.8%; P = .2635), OS (fHIFU, 97% vs. AS, 97%; P = .9237), or metastasis (n = 0 in fHIFU and n = 2 in AS; P = .4981). Major complications (≥ Clavien 3) were rare (n = 4), although 36.4% of men experienced complications. No relevant changes were noted in continence (P = .3949).  Conclusion:   At a 4-year median follow-up, fHIFU for mainly low-risk PCa (ISUP grade 1) is safe, may decrease the need for radical treatment or ADT and may allow longer time to treatment compared to AS.

We evaluated commercial insurance coverage determinations to assess the degree of variation across a national sample.  Methods and materials:   We identified the predominant carrier of commercial insurance in each state based on the 2020 US Government Accounting Office (GAO-21-34) report on insurance. For each state, publicly available medical policies from January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2021 were analyzed for coverage of 3 widely accepted procedures: hydrogel spacer, fluciclovine- positron emission tomography (PET), and intensity modulated radiation in low volume metastatic prostate cancer.  Results:   We analyzed 83 commercial medical policies across 51 states and District of Columbia. There was widespread variation in coverage policy. Hydrogel spacer was determined medically necessary in 9 states, mixed coverage in 8, not medically necessary in 22, and no available public policy in 12. Use of fluciclovine-PET required a minimum prostate specific antigen level of 2 ng/mL in 9 states, 1 ng/mL in 17, any minimum prostate specific antigen in 7, mixed coverage in 12, and no publicly available policy in 6. Intensity modulated radiation in low volume metastatic prostate cancer was medically necessary in 17 states, not necessary in 7, and not stated in 27. Insurance carriers often used external utilization management companies such as AIM-Healthcare and Evicore Healthcare. These determinations were more restrictive than carriers which did not use utilization management.  Conclusions:   Commercial medical policies vary widely in medical necessity determinations for novel prostate cancer treatment procedures that are Food and Drug-approved and covered by Medicare. These data suggest a need for more consistent methodology for medical necessity determination to mitigate the current state where patients have unequal access to cancer procedures due to the location of residence and age.""","""['Xinglei Shen', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Stacie B Dusetzina', 'Ronald C Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Commercial Insurance Coverage of Advanced Radiation Therapy Techniques Compared With American Society for Radiation Oncology Model Policies.', 'Insurance Coverage of Facial Gender Affirmation Surgery: A Review of Medicaid and Commercial Insurance.', 'National Variation of Insurance Coverage for Gender-Affirming Facial Feminization Surgery.', 'Value-based interventional pain management: a review of medicare national and local coverage determination policies.', 'Alignment of health plan coverage policies for somatic multigene panel testing with clinical guidelines in select solid tumors.']"""

Vascular, Extracellular, and Restricted Diffusion for Cytometry in Tumor (VERDICT) MRI analysis could improve the stratification of positive mpMRI findings. Purpose To evaluate VERDICT MRI, mpMRI-derived apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) as determinants of clinically significant PCa (csPCa). Materials and Methods Between April 2016 and December 2019, men suspected of having PCa were prospectively recruited from two centers and underwent VERDICT MRI and mpMRI at one center before undergoing targeted biopsy. Biopsied lesion ADC, lesion-derived fractional intracellular volume (FIC), and PSAD were compared between men with csPCa and those without csPCa, using nonparametric tests subdivided by Likert scores. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated to test diagnostic performance. Results Among 303 biopsy-naive men, 165 study participants (mean age, 65 years ± 7 [SD]) underwent targeted biopsy; of these, 73 had csPCa. Median lesion FIC was higher in men with csPCa (FIC, 0.53) than in those without csPCa (FIC, 0.18) for Likert 3 (P = .002) and Likert 4 (0.60 vs 0.28, P < .001) lesions. Median lesion ADC was lower for Likert 4 lesions with csPCa (0.86 × 10-3 mm2/sec) compared with lesions without csPCa (1.12 × 10-3 mm2/sec, P = .03), but there was no evidence of a difference for Likert 3 lesions (0.97 × 10-3 mm2/sec vs 1.20 × 10-3 mm2/sec, P = .09). PSAD also showed no difference for Likert 3 (0.17 ng/mL2 vs 0.12 ng/mL2, P = .07) or Likert 4 (0.14 ng/mL2 vs 0.12 ng/mL2, P = .47) lesions. The diagnostic performance of FIC (AUC, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.00) was higher (P = .02) than that of ADC (AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.91) and PSAD (AUC, 0.74; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.82) for the presence of csPCa in biopsied lesions.

However, the roles of UBE2R2-AS1 in prostate cancer (PC) remained poorly understood.  Methods:   The expression of UBE2R2-AS1 was determined in tumor tissues and paired adjacent tissues from PC patients using quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. Correlation between UBE2R2-AS1 expression and clinicopathological parameters and overall survival were investigated by Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier method analysis. The in vitro experiments, including CCK-8 assay, colony formation, flow cytometry and transwell assay were performed to investigate the functional role of UBE2R2-AS1 knockdown or overexpression on PC cell lines (PC-3 and DU145). Related protein expression levels were measured by western blot analysis.  Results:   Our data showed that UBE2R2-AS1 expression was significantly upregulated in PC tissues compared with that in adjacent tissues. The high levels of UBE2R2-AS1 were associated with high Gleason score, advanced clinical T stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. Knockdown of UBE2R2-AS1 suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in PC cells, along with decreased expression of PCNA, CDK4, Cyclin D1, Bcl-2, N-cadherin and Vimentin, and increased E-cadherin expression. Overexpression of UBE12R2-AS1 obtained the opposite results in PC cells.

However, the high rate of erectile dysfunction (ED) after traditional photon-based SBRT remains an ongoing challenge that greatly impacts the quality of life of PC survivors. Modern proton therapy allows higher conformal SBRT delivery and has the potential to reduce ED occurrence but its cost-effectiveness remains uninvestigated.  Methods:   A Markov decision model was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proton SBRT versus photon SBRT in reducing irradiation-related ED. Base-case evaluation was performed on a 66-year-old (median age of PC) localized PC patient with normal pretreatment erectile function. Further, stratified analyses were performed for different age groups (50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75 years) and threshold analyses were conducted to estimate cost-effective scenarios. A Chinese societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (37,653 US dollars [$])/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) was adopted.  Results:   For the base case, protons provided an additional 0.152 QALY at an additional cost of $7233.4, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $47,456.5/QALY. Protons was cost-effective for patients ≤62-year-old at the WTP of China (≤66-year-old at a WTP of $50,000/QALY; ≤73-year-old at a WTP of $100,000/QALY). For patients at median age, once the current proton cost ($18,000) was reduced to ≤$16,505.7 or the patient had a life expectancy ≥88 years, protons were cost-effective at the WTP of China.  Conclusions:   Upon assumption-based modeling, the results of current study support the use of proton SBRT in younger localized PC patients who are previously potent, for better preservation of erectile function.

Index tumor was located by uroradiologist, nuclear medicine specialist, and uropathologist on a 12-sector prostate pathology map and compared with each other in terms of accuracy and locoregional clinical staging.  Results:   Mean age of the patients was 66.18 ± 6.67 years and the mean of preoperative PSA results was 21.11 ± 32.56 ng/ml. Nearly half of the patients' (44.9%) pathology was reported as ISUP grade 4 and 5% and 18.4% of patients were surgical margin positive.

We calculated the pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to explore the association between ADT use and the infection risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and severity of COVID-19. After synthesizing the evidence, the pooled RR in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was equal to 1.17, and the SARS-CoV-2 positive risk in PCa patients using ADT was not significantly different from that in those not using ADT (P = 0.544). Moreover, no significant results concerning the beneficial effect of ADT on the rate of intensive care unit admission (RR = 1.04, P = 0.872) or death risk (RR = 1.23, P = 0.53) were found. However, PCa patients with a history of ADT use had a markedly higher COVID-19 hospitalization rate (RR = 1.31, P = 0.015) than those with no history of ADT use. These findings indicate that ADT use by PCa patients is associated with a high risk of hospitalization during infection with SARS-CoV-2. A large number of high quality studies are needed to confirm these results.""","""['Yuan-Bin Huang', 'Wei-Lin Li', 'Man Sun', 'Xu Duan', 'Yu-Tong Wang', 'Lu-Xin Zhang', 'Zi-Han Xin', 'Zhi-Fei Yun', 'Bo Fan', 'Xian-Cheng Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Relationship Between Androgen Deprivation Therapy for Prostate Cancer and Risk of SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity among prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy in men with prostate cancer is not associated with COVID-2019 infection.', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in patients with prostate cancer: A critical review.', 'Quantifying observational evidence for risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease following androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.']"""

Penile sparing approaches, such as brachytherapy, require expertise, prolonged inpatient stays, poor patient convenience, and heterogenous plans with variable long-term toxicity. In this study, we describe the protocol for novel portable apparatus created for PSC, allowing outpatient hybrid interstitial/surface brachytherapy, improving homogeneity and patient convenience.  Methods:   A portable brachytherapy apparatus was developed utilizing a foley catheter, prostate template, 6F interstitial catheters, 5 mm bolus, and a jock strap. The apparatus allowed for internal and external catheter placement housed in a jock strap to allow mobility and defecation without affecting the implant. High-dose-rate brachytherapy was performed as an outpatient.  Results:   The apparatus was then used on a 62-year-old male with cT2pN0M0 (stage IIA) PSC with bilateral glans and urethral meatus involvement, who elected for definitive brachytherapy (4000cGy in 10 fractions over 5-days). Given external dwell positions, heterogeneity correction of the template was calculated (AAPM TG186) with <2% variation. Patient had minimal impact on his active lifestyle during treatment and had complete clinical response at 3-months. Grade 2 skin desquamation resolved at 2-months, with no necrosis. At 6-months, he was able to resume sexual intercourse, and at 12-months, he remained disease-free with sexual and urinary function intact.  Conclusions:   Novel portable implant allows for improved patient convenience, reduced inpatient stay, capable of optimizing dosimetry with hybrid brachytherapy. This outpatient treatment allows the opportunity to increase fractionation, offering high local-control and lower toxicity. Future studies utilizing this apparatus for more fractionated regimens with further lower dose-per-fraction (∼3 Gy/fraction) is recommended.""","""['Anupam Rishi', 'Amarjit S Saini', 'Philippe E Spiess', 'Alice Yu', 'Daniel C Fernandez', 'Peter A S Johnstone', 'Arash O Naghavi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Brachytherapy""","""['High-dose-rate brachytherapy for localized penile cancer: Evolution of a\xa0technique.', 'Optimized penile surface mold brachytherapy using latest stereolithography techniques: A single-institution experience.', 'High-dose-rate interstitial brachytherapy for T1-T2-stage penile carcinoma: short-term results.', 'Brachytherapy for penile carcinoma.', 'Treatment results of high-dose-rate remote afterloading brachytherapy for cervical cancer and retrospective comparison of two regimens.']"""

Focal therapy (FT) options for PCa are tied to accurate spatial identification on mpMRI.  Methods:   Men without prior diagnosis of PCa receiving mpMRI, targeted and systematic prostate biopsy in the Prospective Loyola Urology mpMRI (PLUM) Prostate Biopsy Cohort from 2015-2021 were included. Patients with PI-RADS ≥3 lesions were classified by mpMRI lesion location, targeted biopsy, and systematic biopsy. Patients with single biopsy-confirmed grade group (GG) 2 lesions and concordant systematic biopsy were defined as FT candidates. Multivariable logistic regression evaluated predictors of mpMRI-undetected contralateral PCa.  Results:   Of 897 patients, 450 (50.2%) had a single, 141 (15.7%) had multiple unilateral, and 306 (34.1%) had bilateral mpMRI lesions. 28.7% had a single targeted biopsy-confirmed lesion while 10.4% were multifocal.

We describe the distribution, trends of admissions, and in-hospital mortality associated with key cardiovascular diseases among cancer patients in the USA between 2004 and 2017.  Methods:   Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we, identified admissions with five cardiovascular diseases of interest: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischaemic stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter, and intracranial haemorrhage. Patients were stratified by cancer status and type. We estimated crude annual rates of hospitalizations and annual in-hospital all-cause mortality rates.  Results:   From &gt;42.5 million hospitalizations with a primary cardiovascular diagnosis, 1.9 million (4.5%) had a concurrent record of cancer. Between 2004 and 2017, cardiovascular admission rates increased by 23.2% in patients with cancer, whilst decreasing by 10.9% in patients without cancer. The admission rate increased among cancer patients across all admission causes and cancer types except prostate cancer. Patients with haematological (9.7-13.5), lung (7.4-8.9), and GI cancer (4.6-6.3) had the highest crude rates of cardiovascular hospitalizations per 100 000 US population. Heart failure was the most common reason for cardiovascular admission in patients across all cancer types, except GI cancer (crude admission rates of 13.6-16.6 per 100 000 US population for patients with cancer).

These relatives can benefit from appropriate risk management and preventative strategies arising from an inherited increased risk of breast, ovarian, prostate, melanoma, and pancreatic cancers. Cascade testing has the potential to enable cost-effective cancer control even in low- and middle-income settings, but few studies have hitherto evaluated the psychosocial impact of cascade testing in an Asian population, where the cultural and religious beliefs around inheritance and destiny have previously been shown to influence perception and attitudes toward screening. In this study, we evaluated the short- and long-term psychosocial impact of genetic testing among unaffected relatives of probands identified through the Malaysian Breast Cancer Genetics Study and the Malaysian Ovarian Cancer Study, using validated questionnaires (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Cancer Worry Scale) administered at baseline, and 1-month and 2-year post-disclosure of results. Of the 305 unaffected relatives from 98 independent families who were offered cascade testing, 256 (84%) completed predictive testing and family history of cancers was the only factor significantly associated with uptake of predictive testing. We found that the levels of anxiety, depression, and cancer worry among unaffected relatives decreased significantly after result disclosure and remained low 2-year post-result disclosure. Younger relatives and relatives of Malay descent had higher cancer worry at both baseline and after result disclosure compared to those of Chinese and Indian descent, whereas relatives of Indian descent and those with family history of cancers had higher anxiety and depression levels post-result disclosure.

In this study, the effect of a sublethal dose of H2O2 on E- and N-cadherin levels, and on migrative behaviors of PCa cells was investigated.  Methods:   To determine a sublethal concentration of H2O2 on cell proliferation and ROS production were examined using WST-1 and DCFH-DA assays, respectively.

The migrative potentials of the cells were examined by Cytoselect 96-well cell migration assay.  Results:   Treatment of the PCa cells with a sublethal dose of H2O2 results in a decrease in E-cadherin and an increase in N-cadherin levels, at both mRNA and protein levels. However, inhibition of ERK using PD98059 abolishes the effects of H2O2. In addition, the cells that were treated with H2O2 have gained further migrative abilities compared to control cells, and this ability was repressed when PD98059 was used together with H2O2.

By lowering the testosterone level into the castration range, ADT deprives the tumor of a key growth factor.  Methods:   For this article, we evaluated the treatment recommendations contained in national and international guidelines (German S3 guidelines and those of the European Society for Medical Oncology [ESMO], European Association of Urology [EAU], and National Comprehensive Cancer Network [NCCN]), as well as pertinent publications revealed by a PubMed search and the congress abstracts of the ESMO and of the American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO].  Results:   The past few years have witnessed fundamental changes in the treatment of mHSPC. Treatment intensification with docetaxel or with the new drugs directed against the androgen receptor signal pathway (abiraterone, apalutamide and enzalutamide) has been found to lower mortality by 19-40% and is now an integral component of first-line therapy. Relevant new findings have also been obtained with threefold combinations of ADT, docetaxel, and abiraterone or darolutamide. For patients with a light tumor burden, local radiotherapy of the primary tumor improves the probability of survival at 3 years by 8% (45.4 versus 49.1 months, difference 3.6 months; 95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.2 months).

While reports have shown that WTC-dust associates with the increased prevalence of inflammatory related disorders, studies to date have not determined whether this exposure impacts cancer progression. In this study, we have used genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models with prostate specific deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor to study the impact of WTC-dust exposure on deposition of dust particles, inflammation, and cancer progression. In normal C57/BL6 mice, dust exposure increased cellular expression of inflammatory genes with highest levels in the lung and peripheral blood. In normal and tumor bearing GEM mice, increased immune cell infiltration to the lungs was observed. Pathological evaluation of mice at different time points showed that WTC-dust exposure promoted PI3K-AKT activation, increased epithelial proliferation and acinar invasion in prostates with heterozygous and homozygous Pten loss. Using autochthonous and transplant GEM models of prostate cancer we demonstrated that dust exposure caused reduced survival as compared to control cohorts. Finally, we used imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to detect elevated immune cell infiltration and cellular expression of inflammatory markers in prostate tumors isolated from human WTC survivors.

We collected clinical surgical samples of patients who were suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), common prostate cancer (PCa), and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and detected the expression of MUS81 in healthy prostate epithelial cells, PCa cells, and androgen-independent PCa cells. We subsequently performed CCK-8 assays, flow cytometry, and Transwell invasion and migration assay to determine the proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis abilities of transfected CRPC cells as well as drug toxicity of Olaparib to CRPC cells. The expression of MUS81 indicated marked upregulation in PCa and CRPC tissues, compared with the level of MUS81 in BPH tissues. MUS81 silencing inhibited the proliferation of CRPC cells and promoted their sensitivity to Olaparib. MUS81 silencing in CRPC cells remarkably accelerated cell apoptosis and greatly inhibited cell invasion and metastasis after Olaparib administration. MUS81 silencing in CRPC cells has significantly enhanced the sensitivity of cells to Olaparib, which provides evidence for the prediction of Olaparib resistance in CRPC cells by the MUS81 gene and is expected to become a promising gene target in CRPC therapy.""","""['Lifeng Gong', 'Yu Tang', 'Li Jiang', 'Wei Tang', 'Shengjun Luo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol Res""","""['Targeting NPRL2 to enhance the efficacy of Olaparib in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Inhibition of MUS81 improves the chemical sensitivity of olaparib by regulating MCM2 in epithelial ovarian cancer.', 'YAP is closely correlated with castration-resistant prostate cancer, and downregulation of YAP reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis of PC-3 cells.', 'A Novel Use of Olaparib for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'PARP Inhibitors and Proteins Interacting with SLX4.']"""

Given the growing population of Latino/as immigrants aged ≥60 years and the current lack of relevant data, this study aims to understand the cancer prevention and perception of cancer diagnosis among older Latinos to ensure that they receive effective prevention, intervention, and psychosocial care.  Method:   A survey exploring attitudes about cancer was developed and administered in Spanish. Using convenience sampling, 168 individuals identifying as Latino/as were surveyed in Tampa, Florida. Descriptive analysis was conducted to understand study population characteristics. Frequencies were assessed to understand the participants' responses to cancer-related attitude questions. The effects of age, country of origin, length of stay in the United States, and marital status on the participants' cancer-related attitudes were assessed using logistic regression.  Results:   The mean age of the study participants was 67.9 years, 34.5% were male, and the mean length of stay in the United States was 25.8 years. In total, 29% and 24.4% of the participants knew that breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively, can be diagnosed early. Individuals with an elementary education were less likely to have sufficient knowledge of cancer prevention and diagnosis. Additionally, 93.5% of the population was aware that tobacco use can lead to cancer, and 84.5% knew that exposure to tobacco smoke can affect both the smoker and their family.  Conclusion:   Older Latino/as possess knowledge about cancer causes yet lack knowledge regarding cancer prevention and diagnosis, potentially creating barriers and causing them to avoid treatment. Focusing on cancer-related health education among older Latino/as is a step toward appropriate and equitable cancer care.""","""['Iraida V Carrion', 'Malinee Neelamegam', 'Tania Estapé', 'Tracy Doering', 'Olivia Snyder', 'Ebony Tollinchi', 'Jorge Estapé']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ethn Dis""","""['HIV risk behaviors and sociodemographic features of HIV-infected Latinos residing in a new Latino settlement area in the Southeastern United States.', 'The Knowledge of the Brain Death Concept Among Latin Americans Residing in Florida (USA).', 'Vasectomy: views of Latinos and white men.', 'Addressing Disparities in Cancer Screening among U.S. Immigrants: Progress and Opportunities.', 'Spanish-Language Consumer Health Information Technology Interventions: A Systematic Review.']"""

The STAT3 signaling cascade is activated by upstream kinase signals and undergoes phosphorylation, homo-dimerization, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding, resulting in the expression of target genes involved in tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and immune editing. STAT3 hyperactivation has been documented in a number of tumors, including head and neck, breast, lung, liver, kidney, prostate, pancreas cancer, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemia. Drug discovery is a timeconsuming and costly process; it may take ten to fifteen years to bring a single drug to the market. Machine learning algorithms are very fast and effective and commonly used in the field, such as drug discovery. These algorithms are ideal for the virtual screening of large compound libraries to classify molecules as active or inactive.  Objective:   The present work aims to perform machine learning-based virtual screening for the STAT3 drug target.  Methods:   Machine learning models, such as k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, Gaussian naïve Bayes, and random forest for classifying the active and inactive inhibitors against a STAT3 drug target, were developed. Ten-fold cross-validation was used for model validation. Then the test dataset prepared from the zinc database was screened using the random forest model. A total of 20 compounds with 88% accuracy was predicted as active against STAT3. Furthermore, these twenty compounds were docked into the active site of STAT3. The two complexes with good docking scores as well as the reference compound were subjected to MD simulation. A total of 100ns MD simulation was performed.  Results:   Compared to all other models, the random forest model revealed better results. Compared to the standard reference compound, the top two hits revealed greater stability and compactness.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, our predicted hits have the ability to inhibit STAT3 overexpression to combat STAT3-associated diseases.""","""['Abdul Wadood', 'Amar Ajmal', 'Muhammad Junaid', 'Ashfaq Ur Rehman', 'Reaz Uddin', 'Syed Sikander Azam', 'Alam Zeb Khan', 'Asad Ali']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Pharm Des""","""['Machine learning-based drug design for identification of thymidylate kinase inhibitors as a potential anti-Mycobacterium tuberculosis.', 'Identification of STAT1 and STAT3 specific inhibitors using comparative virtual screening and docking validation.', 'Chemical probes that competitively and selectively inhibit Stat3 activation.', 'STAT proteins as novel targets for cancer drug discovery.', ""STAT3 and Its Pathways' Dysregulation-Underestimated Role in Urological Tumors."", 'Computer-assisted drug repurposing for thymidylate kinase drug target in monkeypox virus.', 'Machine learning in metastatic cancer research: Potentials, possibilities, and prospects.', 'Identification of novel inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 as therapeutic options using machine learning-based virtual screening, molecular docking and MD simulation.', 'In Silico Characterization of Withania coagulans Bioactive Compounds as Potential Inhibitors of Hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG-CoA) Reductase of Mus musculus.', 'CLC-Pred 2.0: A Freely Available Web Application for In Silico Prediction of Human Cell Line Cytotoxicity and Molecular Mechanisms of Action for Druglike Compounds.']"""

Methods:   We created a decision tree model for PSA (current standard) and STHLM3 (new alternative). Cost effectiveness was evaluated in a hypothetical cohort of male individuals aged 50-69 years. The study applied a Danish hospital perspective with a time frame restricted to the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway, beginning with the initial PSA/STHLM3 test, and ending with biopsy and histopathological diagnosis. Estimated values from the decision-analytical model were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the base-case analysis.  Results:   The model-based analysis revealed that STHLM3 testing was more effective than the PSA, but also more costly, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €511.7 (95% credible interval, 359.9-674.3) for each additional correctly classified individual. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, variations in the cost of STHLM3 had the greatest influence on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, all iterations were positioned in the north-east quadrant of the incremental cost-effectiveness scatterplot. At a willingness to pay of €700 for an additional correctly classified individual, STHLM3 had a 100% probability of being cost effective.  Conclusions:   Compared to the PSA test as the initial testing modality in the prostate cancer diagnostic workup, STHLM3 testing showed improved incremental effectiveness, however, at additional costs. The results were sensitive to the cost of the STHLM3 test; therefore, a lower cost of the STHLM3 test would improve its cost effectiveness compared with PSA tests.""","""['Bettina Wulff Risør', 'Nasrin Tayyari Dehbarez', 'Jacob Fredsøe', 'Karina Dalsgaard Sørensen', 'Bodil Ginnerup Pedersen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Appl Health Econ Health Policy""","""['Prostate cancer screening in men aged 50-69 years (STHLM3): a prospective population-based diagnostic study.', 'Prostate cancer screening in men aged 50 to 69 years (STHLM3): A prospective population-based diagnostic study.

However, as patients.. survival is increasing, long-term side effects of chemotherapeutic agents such as second cancer development are becoming increasingly important.  Patients:   We therefore investigated a total of 2 856 Patients with UICC-stage III / IV colon cancer, 223 of whom (7.8%) had developed a subsequent second cancer.  Results:   Median follow-up was 73.2 months (range 209.9 months, 95%-CI 69.8-76.9). Most frequent second cancers were prostate cancer (18.4%), colon cancer (16.1%), breast cancers (8.1%), lung cancer (8.1%), rectal cancer (4.9%) and uterine cancer (4.9%). However, in comparison to non-treated patients this did not represent a significantly increased risk for subsequent second cancer in patients after treatment with additive chemotherapy. Of interest, our data suggest a significantly decreased second cancer rate in patients treated with FOLFOX compared to FUFOL for additive treatment.  Conclusions:   Second cancer development was not increased after additive chemotherapy for colon cancer, which is a novel aspect in the ongoing discussions on reduction of adjuvant treatment to 3 months or treatment of lymph node negative patients. Novelty and Impact Statement To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study analyzing second cancer development after additive chemotherapy in patients with UICC III-IV colon cancer.

Two different nanostructures of HAp particles, including the HAp flower and HAp sphere, were synthesized with a hydrothermal method, and the targeted binding and extraction abilities of serum albumin of these two HAp particles were compared. By changing the morphology of the nanostructure, the albumin-adsorption capacity of HAp varied significantly. Compared with spherical HAp particles, HAp flower particles have more albumin binding sites per unit area. Thus, the HAp flower displayed the superior capacity for adsorption-release of albumin, which was further employed for clinical prostate cancer screening. Based on the superior adsorption-extraction ability of albumin of HAp flower, serum albumin was adsorbed and extracted by HAp flower from serum samples of prostate cancer patients (n = 30) and healthy volunteers (n = 30), and mixed with silver colloids to perform SERS spectral analysis. The partial least square-support vector machines (PLS-SVM) model is used to analyze the obtained serum albumin SERS spectra and establish the diagnostic model, the diagnostic accuracy was up to 95.00% for differentiating the normal volunteer from prostate patient groups. The results demonstrate that the PLS-SVM model provides superior performance in the classification of a prostate cancer diagnosis.

Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of robotic technology on the recovery of genitourinary function after TME for rectal cancer by analysing the correlations between influencing factors of genitourinary function and robotic surgery.  Methods:   Between January 2017 and January 2020, patients with rectal cancer (cT1-3NxM0) were registered. Genitourinary function was assessed by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) test, Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and urodynamic examination before surgery and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Genitourinary function was compared between the laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (L-TME) and robotic total mesorectal excision (R-TME) groups, and the correlative factors associated with postoperative genitourinary function were analysed using the generalized estimated equation (GEE).  Results:   Compared with L-TME, R-TME showed a superior IPSS, voiding volume, residual urine volume and IIEF score during the early postoperative period. According to the GEE analysis, postoperative genitourinary function was positively correlated with laparoscopic anterior resection/abdomen perineal resection (LAR/APR) but negatively correlated with tumour size, tumour distance to anus, TNM, adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, complete TME, circumferential resection margin (CRM), blood loss, diverting stoma, conversion, and anastomotic leakage.  Conclusion:   Due to the important role of robotic surgical technology on the influential factors of postoperative genitourinary function and the superiority of identifying and preserving autonomic nerves, robotic technology is conducive to the early recovery of postoperative urogenital function while adhering to oncological dissection principles.

However, it is inconclusive whether depressive symptoms are also associated with cancer onset. The aim of this study was to investigate whether depressive symptoms are associated with cancer incidence in a large population-based sample of men and women.  Methods:   This study examined data from waves two (HUNT 2, 1995-97) and three (HUNT 3, 2006-08) of the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT). Depressive symptoms were ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D ≥ 8), cancer onset was identified via linkage with the Cancer Registry of Norway, death records by the national Cause of Death Register (CDR), and information on lifestyle and demographic factors was self-reported. Cox-proportional hazard regression models were used to test associations. Unadjusted, age-adjusted and multivariable best models accounting for smoking, education, marital status and current employment are presented.  Results:   Men and women (n = 61,985; 46.0 % men) were followed from baseline over a period of 778,802 person-years. During the 20-year study period, there were 6856 (11.1 %) individuals with incident cancers and 12,480 (20.1 %) deaths (n = 2498 attributed to cancer). For men with depressive symptoms, 505 (15.3 %) developed incident cancer during the follow-up period, whereas among those without depressive symptoms, 3164 (12.5 %) developed incident cancer. Following adjustment for age, depressive symptomology was not significantly associated with risk of overall cancer onset, nor among prostate, colon or melanoma subtypes. Depressive symptoms were associated with an increased risk of bronchus and lung cancer both before (HR 1.90, 95 % CI 1.43-2.50, p ≤0.001) and after adjustment for age (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.04-1.80, p = 0.025). However, further adjustment for additional possible confounders explained this association. For women with depressive symptoms, 384 (11.2 %) developed incident cancer during the follow-up period, whereas among those with no depressive symptomology, 2803 (9.3 %) developed incident cancer. After accounting for age, depressive symptomology was not associated with risk of overall cancer onset, nor among breast, colon, lung and bronchus, or melanoma subtypes. Additional analyses evaluating relationship of depression symptom severity and cancer onset did not alter findings for men or women.  Limitations:   This report is limited by the post-hoc study design and subsequent non-randomised nature. Future prospective studies are required.  Conclusion:   These results suggest that depressive symptoms are not associated with an increased risk of overall or site-specific cancer onset in these men and women.

A previously introduced radiobiology-based formula was adapted to incorporate the impact of pelvic nodes irradiation (PNI).  Materials and methods:   The risk of post-SRT BF may be expressed by a Poisson-based equation including pre-SRT PSA, the radiosensitivity α, the clonogen density C, the prescribed dose (in terms of EQD2, α/β = 1.5 Gy) and a factor (1-BxλxPSA) accounting for clonogens outside the irradiated volume, being λ the recovery due to PNI. Data of 795 pT2-pT3, pN0/pN1/pNx (n = 627/94/74) patients with follow-up ≥ 5 years and pre-RT PSA ≤ 2 ng/mL were randomly split into training (n = 528) and validation (n = 267) cohorts; the training cohort data were fitted by the least square method. Separate fits were performed for different risk groups. Model performances were assessed by calibration plots and tested in the validation group.  Results:   The median follow-up was 8.5y, median pre-SRT PSA and EQD2 were 0.43 ng/mL and 71.3 Gy respectively; 331/795 pts received PNI. The most clinically significant prognostic grouping was pT3b and/or ISUP4-5 versus pT2/3a and ISUP1-3.

Results suggested optimal SRT dose at 70-74 Gy. The estimated reduction of post-SRT BF due to PNI at these dose values was > 5 % for PSA > 1/>0.15 ng/mL for low/high-risk patients, being > 10 % for high-risk patients with pre-SRT PSA > 0.25 ng/mL.

To contribute with evidence, the present study aimed to evaluate the association between occupational UV exposure and prostate cancer in Danish men.  Methods:   A total of 12,268 men diagnosed with primary prostate cancer before age 70 were identified via the Danish Cancer Registry. The Danish Civil Registration System was used to randomly select five male controls matched on year of birth, alive and free of prostate cancer at the time of diagnosis of the index case. Full individual-level employment history was retrieved from the Danish Supplementary Pension Fund Register and linked to a job exposure matrix to assess occupational UV exposure. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95 % confidence intervals.  Results:   We observed an inverse association between ever exposure to occupational UV and prostate cancer (OR=0.93, 95 % CI: 0.89-0.97). Longer duration of exposure (≥20 years: OR=0.90, 95 % CI: 0.84-0.96) and highest cumulative exposure (OR=0.90, 95 % CI: 0.84-0.96) were both inversely associated with disease risk.

Methods:   We included active patients of the provider group between January 2019 and December 2021 aged 30-85 years. Monthly rates of screening mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis, breast MRI, total prostate specific antigen (PSA), and breast or prostate biopsy per 1,000 people were compared by year overall, by age, and race/ethnicity. Completed procedures were identified by relevant codes in electronic health record data.  Results:   Rates of screening mammography, tomosynthesis, and PSA testing reached the lowest levels in April-May 2020. Breast cancer screening rates decreased 43% in March and 99% in April and May 2020, compared to 2019. Breast cancer screening rates increased gradually beginning in June 2020 through 2021, although more slowly in Black and Hispanic women and in women aged 75-85. PSA testing rates decreased 34% in March, 78% in April, and 53% in May 2020, but rebounded to pre-pandemic levels by June 2020; trends were similar across groups defined by age and race/ethnicity.  Conclusion:   The observed decline in two common screening procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic reflects the impact of the pandemic on cancer early detection and signals potential downstream effects on the prognosis of delayed cancer diagnoses.

Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, this study aimed at identifying genes involved in PARPi resistance in CRPC. Based on the screen, we identified PARP1, and six novel candidates associated with olaparib resistance upon knockout. For validation, we generated multiple knockout populations/clones per gene in C4 and/or LNCaP CRPC cells, which confirmed that loss of PARP1, ARH3, YWHAE, or UBR5 caused olaparib resistance. PARP1 or ARH3 knockout caused cross-resistance to other PARPis (veliparib and niraparib). Furthermore, PARP1 or ARH3 knockout led to reduced autophagy, while pharmacological induction of autophagy partially reverted their PARPi resistant phenotype. Tumor RNA sequencing of 126 prostate cancer patients identified low ARH3 expression as an independent predictor of recurrence.

Time to PSA recurrence is an example of a survival time that is typically interval-censored between two consecutive clinical inspections with opposite test results. In addition, success of medical devices and technologies often depends on factors such as experience and skill level of the medical service providers, thus leading to clustering of these survival times. For analyzing the effects of surgery types and other covariates on median of clustered interval-censored time to post-surgery PSA recurrence, we present three competing novel models and associated frequentist and Bayesian analyses. The first model is based on a transform-both-sides of survival time with Gaussian random effects to account for the within-cluster association. Our second model assumes an approximate marginal Laplace distribution for the transformed log-survival times with a Gaussian copula to accommodate clustering. Our third model is a special case of the second model with Laplace distribution for the marginal log-survival times and Gaussian copula for the within-cluster association. Simulation studies establish the second model to be highly robust against extreme observations while estimating median regression coefficients. We provide a comprehensive comparison among these three competing models based on the model properties and the computational ease of their Frequentist and Bayesian analysis.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study to contrast the findings of prostate MRI and mpUS. Patients who underwent MRI, US and biopsy between 2015 and 2021 were included. Biopsies were performed using a systematic approach (12 cores), as well as with MRI (4 cores/lesion) and US (1 core/lesion) targeting. The US features analyzed consisted of: calcifications, hypoechoic lesions and power or color Doppler positivity. Gleason 3 + 4 or higher was used as to define true positives.

The concordance between MRI and US was 63.5%. Seven individuals with discordant results had clinically significant PCa. MRI alone was more sensitive (87.5% vs 75%) but less specific (28% vs 32%) than US alone. An all-inclusive approach considering any suspicious US or MRI finding had a sensitivity of 95.8%. A more restrictive approach, targeting lesions noted in both US and MRI, yielded the highest specificity (50.0%) and accuracy (55.4%).

We have previously reported that FOXA1 loss induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell motility through elevated TGFβ signaling. However, whether FOXA1 directly regulates hypoxia pathways of CRPC tumors has not been previously studied. Here we report that FOXA1 down-regulation induces hypoxia transcriptional programs, and FOXA1 level is negatively correlated with hypoxia markers in clinical prostate cancer (PCa) samples. Mechanistically, FOXA1 directly binds to an intragenic enhancer of HIF1A to inhibit its expression, and HIF1A, in turn, is critical in mediating FOXA1 loss-induced hypoxia gene expression. Further, we identify CCL2, a chemokine ligand that modulates tumor microenvironment and promotes cancer progression, as a crucial target of the FOXA1-HIF1A axis. We found that FOXA1 loss leads to immunosuppressive macrophage infiltration and increased cell invasion, dependent on HIF1A expression. Critically, therapeutic targeting of HIF1A-CCL2 using pharmacological inhibitors abolishes FOXA1 loss-induced macrophage infiltration and PCa cell invasion.

Generalized Linear Models were constructed to assess total EOL expenditures.  Results:   Eighty six thousand three hundred ninety-six beneficiaries were included (43,198 beneficiaries with ADRD and 43,198 beneficiaries without ADRD). Beneficiaries with ADRD utilized $64,901 at the EOL, which was roughly $407 more than those without ADRD ($64,901 vs. $64,494, P = 0.31).

Results:   The iSMAART located, visualized, and quantified early tumor metastases at the millimeter scale, and can accurately track deep tumors as small as 1.5 mm in live animals. Tumors metastasized into the liver, diaphragm, and tibia in 4 mice were all successfully diagnosed by the integrated tomographic imaging.  Conclusions:   Instead of roughly comparing surface-light intensities, as traditionally performed in 2-dimensional optical imaging, iSMAART provides accurate tumor imaging and quantitative assessment capabilities with integrated CT and optical tomography for cancer metastasis research. With the powerful 3-D optical/CT imaging capability, iSMAART has the potential to tackle more complex research needs with higher targeting accuracy.""","""['Jiahao Chen', 'Ning Zhao', 'Valeria Copello', 'Yi Ru', 'Kerry L Burnstein', 'Yidong Yang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Optical molecular imaging-guided radiation therapy part 1: Integrated x-ray and bioluminescence tomography.', 'Optical molecular imaging-guided radiation therapy part 2: Integrated x-ray and fluorescence molecular tomography.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Rationale for Modernising Imaging in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Optical clearing of unsectioned specimens for three-dimensional imaging via optical transmission and emission tomography.']"""

With a near-universal shortage of genetic counselors and increasing demand, increased access to genetic counseling is crucial. We sought to prospectively implement and assess a clinician-led approach to genetic counseling and testing.  Materials and methods:   Patients with metastatic or localized prostate cancer meeting National Comprehensive Cancer Network® criteria for consideration of genetic testing were offered pre-test genetic counseling by their urologist or medical oncologist as part of their routine clinical care and concurrently approached for enrollment in the Germline Genetics in Prostate Cancer Study. Consented patients filled out a post-counseling survey using validated instruments to assess the quality of counseling. For patients who elected to undergo genetic testing, an additional validated questionnaire was completed following disclosure of results. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients undergoing testing, with a target >60% of patients. The secondary outcome was overall satisfaction with counseling, with a target >85% of patients.  Results:   A total of 275 patients enrolled, and 203 patients elected to undergo genetic testing. Post-counseling surveys were obtained from 265 patients, and post-genetic testing surveys were obtained from 132 patients. Patient satisfaction was high, with 98% of patients reporting being satisfied with the overall quality of pre-test counseling, and 74% of patients elected to undergo genetic testing.  Conclusions:   These results support the effectiveness of clinician-led genetic counseling in prostate cancer. With clinician training, this approach can be utilized to expand access to appropriate germline genetic testing.""","""['Sophia M Abusamra', 'Marissa A Solorzano', 'Mallory Luke', 'Jake Quarles', 'Michelle F Jacobs', 'Sanjay Das', 'Amy Kasputis', 'Linda A Okoth', 'Milan Patel', 'Mariana Seymore', 'Megan E V Caram', 'Rodney L Dunn', 'Sofia D Merajver', 'Elena M Stoffel', 'Zachery R Reichert', 'Todd M Morgan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Mainstream germline genetic testing in men with metastatic prostate cancer: design and protocol for a multicenter observational study.', 'Technology-enhanced AcceleRation of Germline Evaluation for Therapy (TARGET): A randomized controlled trial of a pretest patient-driven webtool vs. genetic counseling for prostate cancer germline testing.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Germline Genetic Testing in Advanced Prostate Cancer; Practices and Barriers: Survey Results from the Germline Genetics Working Group of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium.', 'Germline Testing in Prostate Cancer: When and Who to Test.', 'Clinical Impact of a Rapid Genetic Testing Model for Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients.']"""

Objectives:   To report the EAA US study (i) standard operating procedures (SOPs) for assessing MGT-CDUS, (ii) main MGT-CDUS normative parameters, and (iii) compare the EAA and previously published ""normal"" CDUS values.  Methods:   A cohort of 248 HFM (35.3 ± 5.9 years) was studied, evaluating MGT-CDUS before and after ejaculation following SOPs.  Results:   SOPs for MGT-CDUS assessment are summarized here. All subjects underwent scrotal CDUS and 188 men underwent transrectal ultrasound before and after ejaculation. The main CDUS reference ranges and characteristics of the HFM-MGT are reported here. The mean testicular volume was ∼17 mL. The lower limit for right and left testis was 12 and 11 mL, defining testicular hypotrophy. The upper limit for epididymal head, body, tail, and vas deferens was 11.5, 5, 6, and 4.5 mm, respectively. Testicular and epididymal arterial reference ranges are reported. The EAA varicocoele classification is reported. CDUS-varicocoele was detected in ∼37% of men. Prostate mean volume was ∼25 mL, while lower and upper limits were 15 and 35 mL, defining hypotrophy and enlargement, respectively. Prostate arterial reference ranges are reported. Prostate calcifications and inhomogeneity were frequent; midline prostatic cysts were rare and small. Ejaculatory duct abnormalities were absent. The upper limit for periprostatic venous plexus was 4.5 mm. Lower and upper limits of seminal vesicles (SV) anterior-posterior diameter were 6 and 16 mm, defining hypotrophy or dilation, respectively. Seminal vesicle volume and ejection fraction reference ranges are reported. SV-US abnormalities were rare. Deferential ampullas upper limit was 6 mm.

However, resistance to both drugs occurs frequently through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Wnt signaling, particularly through Wnt5a, plays vital roles in promoting prostate cancer progression and induction of resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. Development of novel strategies targeting Wnt5a to overcome resistance is an urgent need. In this study, we demonstrated that Wnt5a/FZD2-mediated noncanonical Wnt pathway is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. In patient databases, both the levels of Wnt5a and FZD2 expression are upregulated upon the development of enzalutamide resistance and correlate with higher Gleason score, biochemical recurrence, and metastatic status, and with shortened disease-free survival duration. Blocking Wnt5a/FZD2 signal transduction not only diminished the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway, but also suppressed the constitutively activated androgen receptor (AR) and AR variants. Furthermore, we developed a novel bioengineered BERA-Wnt5a siRNA construct and demonstrated that inhibition of Wnt5a expression by the BERA-Wnt5a siRNA significantly suppressed tumor growth and enhanced enzalutamide treatment in vivo. These results indicate that Wnt5a/FZD2 signal pathway plays a critical role in promoting enzalutamide resistance, and targeting this pathway by BERA-Wnt5a siRNA can be developed as a potential therapy to treat advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Shu Ning', 'Chengfei Liu', 'Wei Lou', 'Joy C Yang', 'Alan P Lombard', ""Leandro S D'Abronzo"", 'Neelu Batra', 'Ai-Ming Yu', 'Amy R Leslie', 'Masuda Sharifi', 'Christopher P Evans', 'Allen C Gao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor splice variants in the era of enzalutamide and abiraterone.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'WNT5a Signaling through ROR2 Activates the Hippo Pathway to Suppress YAP1 Activity and Tumor Growth.']"""

Mouse model assay was performed to determine the effect of exosomal circKDM4A on tumorigenesis in vivo. CircKDM4A expression was significantly upregulated in the serum exosomes from PC patients compared with the exosomes from healthy volunteers. Exosomes treatment promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of PC cells but inhibited apoptosis; however, these effects were attenuated after circKDM4A knockdown. Meanwhile, circKDM4A depletion restored exosome-increased circKDM4A expression. Additionally, circKDM4A acted as a miR-338-3p sponge, and miR-338-3p bound to CUL4B in PC cells. CircKDM4A regulated the effect of exosome-induced PC cell malignancy by interacting with miR-338-3p and CUL4B. Moreover, circKDM4A silencing relieved exosome-induced tumor growth in vivo.

In this study, we present our first clinical experience including preliminary biodistribution and dosimetry data of [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT in patients with BCR of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Seven patients with BCR of prostate cancer who revealed no (n = 4) or undetermined (n = 3) findings on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging were referred to [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT. PET/CT imaging was performed 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post injection (p.i.) of 111 ± 11 MBq [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 (mean ± standard deviation). Normal organ distribution and dosimetry were determined. Lesions visually considered as suggestive of prostate cancer were quantitatively analyzed.  Results:   Intense physiological uptake was observed in the salivary and lacrimal glands, liver, spleen, kidneys, intestine and urinary tract. The parotid gland received the highest absorbed dose (0.601 ± 0.185 mGy/MBq), followed by the kidneys (0.517 ± 0.125 mGy/MBq). The estimated overall effective dose for the administration of 111 MBq was 10.1 mSv (0.0913 ± 0.0118 mSv/MBq). In 6 patients, and in particular in 3 of 4 patients with negative [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, at least one prostate cancer lesion was detected in [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging at later time points. The majority of tumor lesions were first visible at 24 h p.i. with continuously increasing tumor-to-background ratio over time. All tumor lesions were detectable at 48 h and 72 h p.i.  Conclusion:   [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT imaging is a promising new diagnostic tool with acceptable radiation exposure for patients with prostate cancer especially when [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging fails detecting recurrent disease.

However, there are few reports on the effects of nanomaterials as vectors on cancer metabolic reprogramming. Herein, a type of nanoparticle with good biocompatibility was synthesized by modifying the double-stranded of DNA containing a sulfhydryl group on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-dsDNA) through salt-aging conjugation methods. The resultant AuNPs-dsDNA complexes possessed low toxicity to PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro. There was also no obvious hepatorenal toxicity after intravenous injection of AuNPs-dsDNA complexes in vivo, which indicated that these nanoparticles had good biological compatibilities. We investigated their biological functions using prostate cancer cells. Seahorse assay showed that AuNPs-dsDNA complexes could increase glycolysis and glycolysis capacity both in PC3 and DU145 cells. We further detected the expression of glycolysis-related genes by qPCR assay, and found that PKM2, PDHA, and LDHA were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics revealed that PC (18:2(9Z,12Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)) and PC (18:0/18:2 (9Z,12Z)) levels were decreased and inosinic acid level was increased in PC3 cells.

However, the mechanisms of Forkhead box F2 in the progression of colorectal cancer remain unclear. PRUNE2 is closely associated with prostate cancer, neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and melanoma. The relationship between Forkhead box F2 and PRUNE2 in colorectal cancer remains unknown. Method: We investigated the effects of Forkhead box F2 upregulation on colorectal cancer cell behavior in vitro using Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, Transwell, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Nude mouse xenografts were established to investigate the effect of Forkhead box F2 upregulation on the growth of colorectal cancer cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm the Forkhead box F2 regulation of PRUNE2 transcription. A series of in vitro assays was performed in cells with Forkhead box F2 upregulation and PRUNE2 knockdown to elucidate the function and regulatory effects of Forkhead box F2 on PRUNE2 transcription in colorectal cancer. Results: Forkhead box F2 was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues. Forkhead box F2 overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, Forkhead box F2 directly targeted PRUNE2 to promote its transcription in colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, PRUNE2 mediated the Forkhead box F2-regulated proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, we demonstrated a significant positive correlation between Forkhead box F2 and PRUNE2 mRNA levels in colorectal cancer tissues. Conclusion: These results indicated that Forkhead box F2 and PRUNE2 in combination may serve as a prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer and that Forkhead box F2 upregulation inhibits the proliferation and invasion of colorectal cancer cells by upregulating PRUNE2.""","""['Ting Li', 'Silin Huang', 'Wei Yan', 'Yu Zhang', 'Qiang Guo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['MiR-19a-3p regulates the Forkhead box F2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and affects the biological functions of colorectal cancer cells.', 'miR-182 promotes cell growth and invasion by targeting forkhead box F2 transcription factor in colorectal cancer.', 'MicroRNA-130a is upregulated in colorectal cancer and promotes cell growth and motility by directly targeting forkhead box F2.', 'lncRNA MCM3AP-AS1 inhibits the progression of colorectal cancer via the miR-19a-3p/FOXF2 axis.', 'Regulation and roles of FOXK2 in cancer.', 'PI3K/AKT/mTOR Dysregulation and Reprogramming Metabolic Pathways in Renal Cancer: Crosstalk with the VHL/HIF Axis.']"""

Expression of AR-V7- a constitutively active, ligand independent splice variant of AR is one of the critical resistant mechanisms regulating metastatic CRPC. TNC is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein, crucial for prostate cancer progression, and associated with prostate cancer bone metastases. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms that regulate AR-V7 expression in prostate cancer cells interacting with osteogenic microenvironment including TNC.  Methods:   Prostate cancer/preosteoblast heterotypical organoids were evaluated via immunofluorescence imaging and gene expression analysis using RT-qPCR to assess cellular compartmentalization, TNC localization, and to investigate regulation of AR-V7 in prostate cancer cells by preosteoblasts and hormone or antiandrogen action. Prostate cancer cells cultured on TNC were assessed using RT-qPCR, Western blotting, cycloheximide chase assay, and immunofluorescence imaging to evaluate (1) regulation of AR-V7, and (2) signaling pathways activated by TNC. Identified signaling pathway induced by TNC was targeted using siRNA and a small molecular inhibitor to investigate the role of TNC-induced signaling activation in regulation of AR-V7. Both AR-V7- and TNC-induced signaling effectors were targeted using siRNA, and TNC expression assessed to evaluate potential feedback regulation.  Results:   Utilizing heterotypical organoids, we show that TNC is an integral component of prostate cancer interaction with preosteoblasts. Interaction with preosteoblasts upregulated both TNC and AR-V7 expression in prostate cancer cells which was suppressed by testosterone but elevated by antiandrogen enzalutamide. Interestingly, the results demonstrate that TNC-induced Src activation regulated AR-V7 expression, post-translational stability, and nuclear localization in prostate cancer cells. Treatment with TNC neutralizing antibody, Src knockdown, and inhibition of Src kinase activity repressed AR-V7 transcript and protein. Reciprocally, both activated Src and AR-V7 were observed to upregulate autocrine TNC gene expression in prostate cancer cells.  Conclusion:   Overall, the findings reveal that prostate cancer cell interactions with the cellular and ECM components in the osteogenic microenvironment plays critical role in regulating AR-V7 associated with metastatic CRPC.

Purpose:   This secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial examined changes in MVPA following a supervised personal training (PT), supervised group-based (GROUP) program, or a home-based, smartphone-assisted exercise (HOME) intervention in PC survivors on ADT and explored individual, environmental, and psychosocial predictors of MVPA.  Methods:   PC survivors on ADT underwent aerobic and resistance training for 6 months via PT, GROUP, or HOME. MVPA was captured via accelerometers and the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Changes in MVPA between groups were assessed using linear regression. The following predictors of MVPA were examined using Spearman correlations: the Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale (NEWS); the Planning, Attitudes, and Behaviours (PAB) scale; the Relatedness to Others in Physical Activity Scale (ROPAS); and individual factors at baseline.  Results:   Participants (n = 37) were 69.4 ± 6.5 years old and 78.4% were on ADT for ≥ 3 months. Changes in accelerometry-based bouts and MVPA as well as self-reported MVPA did not differ between groups at 6 months. The Aesthetics domain of the NEWS questionnaire at baseline was the strongest predictor of positive MVPA changes (r = .66). Attitude (r = .64), planning (r = .57), and motivation (r = .50) at baseline were also predictive of engaging in higher MVPA throughout the intervention.  Conclusion:   Changes in objective MVPA were modest. Additional emphasis on specific psychosocial and individual factors is important to inform theory-based interventions that can foster PA behavior change in PC survivors on ADT.

Elements of an effective cancer vaccine should include the ability to elicit a Type I T-cell response and target multiple antigenic proteins expressed early in the disease. Using existing gene datasets encompassing normal prostate tissue and tumors with Gleason Score ≤ 6 and ≥ 8, 10 genes were identified that were upregulated and conserved in prostate cancer regardless of the aggressiveness of disease. These genes encoded proteins also expressed in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Putative Class II epitopes derived from these proteins were predicted by a combination of algorithms and, using human peripheral blood, epitopes which selectively elicited IFN-γ or IL-10 dominant antigen specific cytokine secretion were determined. Th1 selective epitopes were identified for eight antigens. Epitopes from three antigens elicited Th1 dominant immunity in mice; PSMA, HPN, and AMACR. Each single antigen vaccine demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity inhibiting growth of implanted Myc-Cap cells after immunization as compared to control. Immunization with the combination of antigens, however, was superior to each alone in controlling tumor growth. When vaccination occurred simultaneously to tumor implant, multiantigen immunized mice had significantly smaller tumors than controls (p = 0.002) and a significantly improved overall survival (p = 0.0006).

We develop a flexible random-intercept accelerated failure time model, in which we use Bayesian additive regression trees to capture arbitrarily complex relationships between censored survival times and pre-treatment covariates and use the random intercepts to capture cluster-specific main effects. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to draw posterior inferences about the population survival effects of multiple treatments and examine the variability in cluster-level effects.

Methods:   This retrospective cohort study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program, Medicare claims, and the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey linked data resource linked data (2007-2015) to investigate the relationship between cancer survivors' cost responsibility in the year before and after report of delaying or not filling a prescription medication because of cost in the past 6 months (cost-related medication nonadherence). Secondary exposures and outcomes included Medicare spending and utilization. Generalized linear models assessed bidirectional relationships between cost-related medication nonadherence, spending, and utilization. Effects of residence were assessed via interaction terms.  Results:   Of 6,591 older cancer survivors, 13% reported cost-related medication nonadherence. Survivors were a median 8 years (interquartile range, 4.5-12.5 years) from their cancer diagnosis, 15% were dually Medicare/Medicaid-eligible, and prostate (40%) and breast (32%) cancer survivors were most prevalent. With every $500 USD increase in patient cost responsibility, risk of cost-related medication nonadherence increased by 3% (risk ratio, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.04). After report of cost-related medication nonadherence, patient cost responsibility was 22% higher (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.32) compared with those not reporting nonadherence, amounting to $523 USD (95% CI, $430 USD to $630 USD). Medicare spending and utilization were also higher before and after report of cost-related nonadherence versus none. For survivors residing in rural (18%) and urban (82%) areas, residence did not modify adherence or cost outcomes.

Like breast cancer, endometrial cancer is another malignancy with hormone-dependent and hormone-independent subtypes. We hypothesized that adrenal-restrictive HSD3B1 genotype would associate with hormone-independent cancer subtypes.  Methods:   We employed a previously described classification of tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas into genomic clusters. We determined HSD3B1 genotype frequencies by endometrial cancer genomic cluster and calculated the odds per adrenal-restrictive A allele for the largely hormone-independent copy-number (CN) high subtype vs other subtypes. An equivalent analysis was performed for the genomically similar, hormone-independent basal breast cancer subtype. Last, we performed survival analyses for UK Biobank participants with endometrial cancer by HSD3B1 genotype. All statistical tests were 2-sided.  Results:   The adrenal-restrictive HSD3B1(1245A) allele was associated with the CN-high endometrial cancer subtype (odds ratio [OR] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.14 to 2.32; P = .007). Similarly, HSD3B1(1245A) was associated with the basal breast cancer subtype (OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.13 to 2.08; P = .006). In the UK Biobank, endometrial cancer patients homozygous for HSD3B1(1245A) had worse overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.16 to 1.68; P < .001) and cancer-specific (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.70; P = .001) survival, consistent with the A allele being enriched in the more aggressive CN-high subtype.

Materials and methods:   A total of 172 men were enrolled in this single-arm prospective trial. Men with prostate cancer (Gleason 3+3=6 or Gleason 3+4=7 with ≤10% Gleason pattern 4 overall and <2 cores Gleason pattern 4) eligible for surveillance were included in the study. Men underwent baseline multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and template ± targeted biopsy, then multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging at years 1 and 2 with a 3-year end-of-protocol biopsy. Biopsies during the 3-year protocol period were triggered by abnormalities on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and/or increases in prostate specific antigen density (>0.2 ng/ml/cc).  Results:   The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging to detect progression to clinically significant prostate cancer were 57% (95% CI 39%-74%), 82% (95% CI 74%-89%), 50% (95% CI 38%-62%), and 86% (95% CI 81%-90%), respectively. Both multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and prostate specific antigen density were significant predictors for progression (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging OR 6.20, 95% CI 2.72-14.16, P < .001; prostate specific antigen density OR 6.19, 95% CI 2.14-17.92, P = .001).

Recently, several studies have suggested that androgen receptor splicing variants (ARvs) may mediate a compensatory DDR pathway when canonical androgen receptor (AR) signaling is inhibited, thus contributing to the resistance of some patients to this combinational treatment. However, the specific roles of certain ARvs as well as the detailed mechanism of how ARvs regulate the DDR are not well understood. Here, we demonstrated that AR splicing variant 7 (ARv7), which is the most abundant form of ARvs, significantly promotes the DDR of PCa cells under severe DNA damage independent of its parental AR by using the ionizing radiation (IR) and doxorubicin (Dox)-treated cell models. Mechanistically, ARv7 is sufficient to upregulate both the homologous recombination (HR) and the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathways by forming a positive regulatory loop with poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1). Moreover, the presence of ARv7 impairs the synergistic effect between AR antagonists and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, which has been recently shown to be a promising future treatment strategy for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Combined, our data indicate that constitutively active ARv7 not only contributes to radioresistance after ADT, but may also serve as a potential predictive biomarker for assessing the efficacy of novel PARP inhibitor-based therapy in PCa.""","""['Haoge Luo', 'Yanan Liu', 'Yang Li', 'Chaoke Zhang', 'Bingbing Yu', 'Chen Shao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""FASEB J""","""['ARv7 Represses Tumor-Suppressor Genes in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'T-LAK cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) enhances androgen receptor splice variant (ARv7) and drives androgen-independent growth in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen Receptor and Its Splicing Variant 7 Expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and in Circulating Tumor Cells in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Lineage plasticity and treatment resistance in prostate cancer: the intersection of genetics, epigenetics, and evolution.', 'Androgen Receptor Splice Variants Contribute to the Upregulation of DNA Repair in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We isolated six spongian diterpenes from the marine sponge Spongionella sp., including one new spongionellol A and five previously known molecules. The structures were elucidated using a detailed analysis MS and NMR spectra as well as by comparison with previously reported data. Two of them, namely, spongionellol A and 15,16-dideoxy-15α,17β-dihydroxy-15,17-oxidospongian-16-carboxylate-15,17-diacetate exhibited high activity and selectivity in human prostate cancer cells, including cells resistant to hormonal therapy and docetaxel. The mechanism of action has been identified as caspase-dependent apoptosis. Remarkably, both compounds were able to suppress expression of androgen receptor (AR) and AR-splice variant 7, as well as AR-dependent signaling. The isolated diterpenes effectively inhibited drug efflux mediated by multidrug-resistance protein 1 (MDR1; p-glycoprotein). Of note, a synergistic effect of the compounds with docetaxel, a substrate of p-glycoprotein, suggests resensitization of p-glycoprotein overexpressing cells to standard chemotherapy.

Materials and methods:   Comparative study in adult men diagnosed with BCa in Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires, Argentina, between January 2015 and December 2020.

Primary outcome:   differences in prevalence of aggressiveness features of bladder tumors (variant histology; high-grade tumors; muscle-invasive disease; criteria compliance for high or very-high risk of progression) between irradiated and radiation-naive patients at diagnosis of BCa.  Secondary outcomes:   differences in eRFS and eCFS between groups.  Results:   In total, 34 and 291 patients were included in the Irradiated and Radiation-naive groups, respectively. Mean age at the time of diagnosis of BCa was 72.7 years (CI 95% 71.6-73.8). Median follow-up of the overall cohort was 25 months (IQR 11-45.5). Concerning primary outcomes, no statistical differences were found except for a higher prevalence of low-grade tumors between irradiated patients and high-grade tumors between radiation-naive patients (P 0.018). Regarding secondary outcomes, prior RT did not increase neither eRFS nor eCFS in both univariate and multivariate analysis.  Conclusions:   BCa after RT for PCa has similar histological features and cystectomy free-survival compared to BCa in a radiation-naive population.

Androgen signaling regulates gene transcription and lipid metabolism, facilitating tumor growth and therapy resistance in early and advanced PCa. Although direct AR signaling inhibitors exist, AR expression and function can also be epigenetically regulated. Specifically, lysine (K)-specific demethylases (KDMs), which are often overexpressed in PCa and CRPC phenotypes, regulate the AR transcriptional program.  Methods:   We investigated LSD1/UTX inhibition, two KDMs, in PCa and CRPC using a multi-omics approach. We first performed a mitochondrial stress test to evaluate respiratory capacity after treatment with MC3324, a dual KDM-inhibitor, and then carried out lipidomic, proteomic, and metabolic analyses. We also investigated mechanical cellular properties with acoustic force spectroscopy.  Results:   MC3324 induced a global increase in H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 accompanied by significant growth arrest and apoptosis in androgen-responsive and -unresponsive PCa systems. LSD1/UTX inhibition downregulated AR at both transcriptional and non-transcriptional level, showing cancer selectivity, indicating its potential use in resistance to androgen deprivation therapy. Since MC3324 impaired metabolic activity, by modifying the protein and lipid content in PCa and CRPC cell lines.

By detecting the expression levels of MAGI2-AS3 and miR-142-3p, the correlation between the MAGI2-AS3 expression and the characteristics of clinical data was analyzed. ROC curve analysis was performed and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of MAGI2-AS3 in distinguishing prostate cancer patients from healthy controls. The function of MAGI2-AS3 in prostate cancer cells was explored through CCK-8 and Transwell assays, and the relationship between MAGI2-AS3 and miR-142-3p was investigated by luciferase activity assay. MAGI2-AS3 has descended expression while miR-142-3p has an ascendant one in prostate cancer serum samples and cells.

Two experienced readers (R1 and R2) independently evaluated the images, blindly to biopsy results. The radiologists assessed the ADC ratios by tracing a circular 10 mm2 ROI on the biopsied lesion and on the apparently benign contralateral parenchyma.

The physiological activities of ARs have been proven to be diverse; however, the specific molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, reverse virtual screening and network pharmacology were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of the physiological function of ARs and their endogenous metabolites. The Metascape database was used for GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis. Furthermore, molecular docking was used to investigate the interactions between active compounds and potential targets. The results showed that the bioavailability of most ARs and their endogenous metabolites was 0.55 and 0.56, while the bioavailability of certain endogenous metabolites was only 0.11. Multiplex analysis was used to screen 73 important targets and 4 core targets (namely, HSP90AA1, EP300, HSP90AB1 and ERBB2) out of the 163 initial targets. The important targets involved in the key KEGG pathway were pathways in cancer (hsa05200), lipid and atherosclerosis (hsa05417), Th17 cell differentiation (hsa04659), chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation (hsa05207), and prostate cancer (hsa05215).

Recently, numerous studies have shown that tumor cells were able to educate their microenvironment by delivering a significant amount of exosomes, however, the mechanism that exosomes from PCa cells work in macrophage polarization remains obscure. Therefore, we sought to determine whether blockade of exosome generation by GW4869, an inhibitor of exosome biogenesis, would impede macrophages from differentiating into M2 cells.  Results:   In this study, we first obtained exosomes from the supernatant media of PCa cells cultured with exosome-free serum using the Magcapture™ Exosome Isolation Kit PS, and then investigated their effects on macrophages. Our data confirmed that exosomes released by prostate cancer cells can induce macrophages to differentiate into M2 cells. Mechanistically speaking, exosomes exert their effects on macrophages through activating the AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways. Importantly, treatment with GW4869 significantly inhibited the release of exosomes from PCa cells, and further impaired M2 differentiation of macrophages and their pro-tumor activity. We also demonstrated that GW4869 was able to inhibit the education of M2 macrophages, and then inhibit the progression of prostate cancer in vivo.  Conclusions:   In brief, our findings indicated that GW4869 impeded the PCa exosome-induced M2 differentiation of macrophages and the progression of prostate cancer, suggesting that GW4869 could play an important role in the treatment of prostate cancer metastasis as an inhibitor of tumor exosome secretion.""","""['Yilin Peng#', 'Min Zhao#', 'Yinying Hu', 'Hongyan Guo', 'Yanyan Zhang', 'Yanqin Huang', 'Lin Zhao', 'Yong Chai', 'Zhigang Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Immunol""","""['Blockade of lncRNA-ASLNCS5088-enriched exosome generation in M2 macrophages by GW4869 dampens the effect of M2 macrophages on orchestrating fibroblast activation.', 'Involvement of macrophage-derived exosomes in abdominal aortic aneurysms development.', 'Cancer derived exosomes induce macrophages immunosuppressive polarization to promote bladder cancer progression.', 'Tumor-derived exosomes in the regulation of macrophage polarization.', 'H-TEX-mediated signaling between hepatocellular carcinoma cells and macrophages and exosome-targeted therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'New Possible Ways to Use Exosomes in Diagnostics and Therapy via JAK/STAT Pathways.', 'Osteoclast-Derived Exosomal miR-5134-5p Interferes with Alveolar Bone Homeostasis by Targeting the JAK2/STAT3 Axis.', 'Exosomes: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications in Cancer.', 'Exosome-mediated crosstalk between tumor cells and innate immune cells: implications for cancer progression and therapeutic strategies.', 'Effects of glioblastoma-derived extracellular vesicles on the functions of immune cells.']"""

Their latest versions now include multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) findings. For their implementation into clinical practice, critical external validations are needed.  Methods:   We retrospectively analyzed the patient data of 554 men who underwent ultrasound-guided targeted and systematic prostate biopsies at 2 centers. We validated the mpMRI-RCs of Radtke et al. (RC-R) and Alberts et al. (RC-A), previously shown to predict prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa). We assessed these RCs' prediction accuracy by analyzing the receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve and evaluated their clinical utility using Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), including Net-Benefit and Net-Reduction curves.  Results:   We found that the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for predicting PCa was 0.681 [confidence interval (CI) 95% 0.635-0.727] for RC-A. The AUCs for predicting csPCa were 0.635 (CI 95% 0.583-0.686) for RC-A and 0.676 (CI 95% 0.627-0.725) for RC-R. For example, at a risk threshold of 12%, RC-A needs to assess 334 and RC-R 500 patients to detect one additional true positive PCa or csPCa patient, respectively. At the same risk threshold of 12%, RC-A only needs to assess 6 and RC-R 16 patients to detect one additional true negative PCa or csPCa patient.  Conclusion:   The mpMRI-RCs, RC-R and RC-A, are robust and valuable tools for patient counseling. Although they do not improve PCa and csPCa detection rates by a clinically meaningful margin, they aid in avoiding unnecessary prostate biopsies.

Results:   336 men with median age, PSA and PSA-Density of 67.7 years (IQR:12.6), 6.3 ng/ml (IQR:3.3) and 0.12 ng/ml/cc (IQR:0.10), respectively; 63 index lesions were PIRADS3, 204 PIRADS4, and 69 PIRADS5. 65.8% and 37.8% were malignant and ST, respectively. The significant positive association highlighted between malignancy and ST with age, DRE, PSA-Density and PIRADSv2. PSA-Density and PIRADSv2 ≥ 3 presented the highest sensitivity to detect malignancy, and their combination showed sensitivity nearly 95% (AUC:0.803). Nomograms for malignancy and ST included the variables age, DRE, PSA-Density, and PIRADSv2 with a sensitivity closely 91% (AUC:0.833), and a specificity of almost 85% for ST, exposing risk < 5% for ST when PSA-Density is < 0.15, not suspicious DRE and PIRADS3.  Conclusion:   PSA-Density and PIRADSv2 classification in risk nomograms can provide highly relevant information to increase the accuracy in the diagnosis of PC and ST.""","""['Miguel Angel Rodríguez Cabello', 'Santiago Méndez Rubio', 'Arturo Platas Sancho', 'Joaquin Carballido Rodríguez']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Comparative study between 1.5 and 3 Tesla multiparametric MRI systems using the PIRADS version 2 classification in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Developing a nomogram based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for forecasting high-grade prostate cancer to reduce unnecessary biopsies within the prostate-specific antigen gray zone.', 'The outcomes of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate in a New Zealand population.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The comparability of models for predicting the risk of a positive prostate biopsy with prostate-specific antigen alone: a systematic review.', 'Role of PSA Density and MRI in PSA Interpretation.

Method:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 446 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2016 and 2018. Patients suitable for FT had unifocal significant prostate cancer on MRI, as well as on pathological data from targeted and systematic biopsies. Inclusion criteria were defined by the 2014 consensus conference, PSA<15ng/mL, tumor stage T1c-T2a and Gleason score 3+3 or 3+4 on biopsies. Disease was considered to be underestimated on postoperative data in the presence of extraprostatic invasion, a high Gleason score (≥4+4) and significant multifocality defined by secondary foci of Gleason 6 (3+3)>5mm or Gleason 7 (3+4).  Results:   In our cohort of 446 patients, 97 patients met the inclusion criteria, and 27 patients (27.8%) were eligible for focal therapy.

Adequate risk stratification could personalize post-surgical adjuvant treatment. Our objective was to identify predictive factors for biochemical relapse (BCR) in patients with lymph node (LN) invasion at the time of radical prostatectomy(RP).  Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent RP for high-risk PCa with LN invasion in two academic centres between 2008 and 2019 were included. Patients with metastatic disease or extrapelvic LN involvement were excluded. Following data were collected retrospectively: age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, clinical and pathological stage, number of metastatic LN and LN density. Outcome was BCR during follow-up. BCR-free survival was assessed by Kaplan-Meier method and its association with relevant variables was determined with log-rank test.  Results:   Twenty-six patients were included. Median (IQR) age, PSA and follow-up were 64.5 years (55-78), 9.2ng/mL (4.4-20) and 16.1 months (6-27.5), respectively. Twenty patients (77%) had BCR after surgery, accounting for 24-month BCR-free survival of 65%. Patients with LN density > 15% had better survival rates than those with ≤ 15% (40% vs. 0%, respectively, at 24 months; P=0.06) without reaching significance. Cox proportional Hazards analysis could not evidence predictive factors of BCR free-survival.  Conclusions:   LN density seemed associated with BCR-free survival within patients with high-risk PCa and positive LN at RP. However, extraprostatic extension, number of positive LN and positive surgical margins were not independent risk factors for BCR.

However, the role and mechanism of circRNA hsa_circ_0102485 in PCa remains unclear.  Materials & methods:   The real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify hsa_circ_0102485 expression in PCa. The potential mechanisms and roles of hsa_circ_0102485 in tumor growth were explored using dual-luciferase-reporter and subcutaneous-xenograft assays, rescue experiments, and immunohistochemical staining. Clinical correlations were assessed by tissue-on-a-chip in-situ hybridization and Fisher's exact test.  Results:   Hsa_circ_0102485 expression was decreased in PCa, and overexpression of hsa_circ_0102485 suppressed the proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and antiapoptotic abilities of PCa cells. MicroRNA 188-3p (MiR-188-3p) is a direct target of hsa_circ_0102485, and cotransfection of hsa_circ_0102485 in PCa cells overexpressing miR-188-3p inhibited its promotive effects. Hsa_circ_0102485 indirectly promotes the expression of AT-rich interaction domain 5B (ARID5B) and androgen receptor (AR) by sponging miR-188-3p and inhibiting PCa cell growth. Correlation analysis showed that hsa_circ_0102485 expression in PCa was not significantly correlated with the age, International Society of Urologic Pathologists (ISUP) grade, Gleason score, or lymph node metastasis status of PCa patients.  Conclusion:   Hsa_circ_0102485 plays an inhibitory role in PCa by regulating the Mir-188-3p/ARID5B/AR axis and may be a potential diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for PCa that requires further study.""","""['Zhenjie Chen', 'Shi Fu', 'Yiqian Shan', 'Haihao Li', 'Haifeng Wang', 'Jingyu Liu', 'Wei Wang', 'Yinglong Huang', 'Hongxing Huang', 'Jiansong Wang', 'Mingxia Ding']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pathol Res Pract""","""['Hsa_circ_0003258 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by complexing with IGF2BP3 and sponging miR-653-5p.', 'Circular RNA hsa_circ_0043278 inhibits breast cancer progression via the miR-455-3p/EI24 signalling pathway.', 'has_circ_0070512 promotes prostate cancer progression by regulating the miR-338-3p/hedgehog signaling pathway.', 'Overexpression of circular RNA hsa_circ_0001038 promotes cervical cancer cell progression by acting as a ceRNA for miR-337-3p to regulate cyclin-M3 and metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 expression.', 'Classic and New Markers in Diagnostics and Classification of Breast Cancer.']"""

Methods:   In this work, micro-synchrotron radiation x-ray fluorescence (µ-SRXRF) was used to examine and characterize a gadolinium-based zinc-sensitive agent (GdL2) currently under development for detection of prostate cancer (PCa) by MRI.

The patient cohort was divided into 4 groups, focal EPE (F-EPE) only (n=177; 18.5%), nonfocal/established (E-EPE) only (n=634; 66.2%), mBNI only (n=51; 5.3%). The rate of positive surgical margin and estimated volume of tumor were significantly higher in patients with both EPE and mBNI than in those with either.

Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a comparable prognosis after prostatectomy between those showing F-EPE only versus mBNI only ( P =0.986), and these 2 cohorts were combined for further analysis. Then, patients showing E-EPE only had a significantly higher or lower risk of progression compared with those showing F-EPE or mBNI only ( P <0.001) or both EPE and mBNI ( P <0.001), respectively.

Objective:   To evaluate the association between GnRH agonist use, PCa diagnosis per se, and CVD risk in men with type 2 diabetes.  Design, setting, and participants:   This nationwide population-based cohort study identified men with type 2 diabetes by use of data in the Prostate Cancer Data Base Sweden version 4.1 and the Swedish National Diabetes Register, with longitudinal data from 2006 to 2016. These data were used to create 2 cohorts, 1 including men with and without PCa and the other including men with PCa who received and did not receive GnRH agonists. Data analysis was conducted from January 2006 to December 2016.  Exposures:   Treatment with GnRH agonists and PCa diagnosis were the primary exposures.  Main outcomes and measures:   Primary outcome was a 10% increase in predicted 5-year CVD risk score. Secondary outcome was worsening hypertension as defined by the European Society of Hypertension Guidelines. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze the association.  Results:   The PCa exposure cohort included 5714 men (median [IQR] age, 72.0 [11.0]), and the non-PCa cohort included 28 445 men without PCa (median [IQR] age, 72.0 [11.0]). The GnRH agonist-exposure cohort included 692 men with PCa who received a GnRH agonist, compared with 3460 men with PCa who did not receive a GnRH agonist. Men with PCa receiving GnRH agonists had an increased estimated 5-year CVD risk score compared with men without PCa (hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% CI, 1.16-1.36) and compared with men with PCa not receiving GnRH agonists (HR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35-1.74). Men receiving GnRH agonists had decreased blood pressure compared with men without PCa (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.61-0.80) and compared with men with PCa not receiving GnRH agonists (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.82).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this population-based cohort study, there was an increased risk of CVD in men with type 2 diabetes who received a GnRH agonist for PCa.

This study aimed to assess the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS), the neutrophile-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) in men with mCRPC under docetaxel.  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC and taxane chemotherapy at a tertiary care centre between 2010 and 2019 were screened retrospectively. The biomarkers mGPS, NLR, PLR and SII were assessed and analyzed for biochemical/radiologic response and survival.  Results:   We included 118 patients. Of these, 73 (61.9%) had received docetaxel as first-line, 31 (26.2%) as second-line and 14 (11.9%) as third-line treatment. For biochemical response, mGPS (odds ratio (OR) 0.54, p = 0.04) and PLR (OR 0.63, p = 0.04) were independent predictors in multivariable analysis. SII was significant in first-line cohort only (OR 0.29, p = 0.02). No inflammatory marker was predictive for radiologic response. In multivariable analysis, mGPS and NLR (hazard ratio (HR) 1.71 and 1.12, both p < 0.01) showed significant association with OS in total cohort and mGPS in the first-line cohort (HR 2.23, p < 0.01). Haemoglobin (Hb) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) showed several significant associations regarding 1 year, 3 year, OS and biochemical/radiologic response.

We aimed to validate the screening criteria for bone metastases in patients with treatment-naïve prostate cancer.  Methods:   This single-center retrospective study included all patients with treatment-naïve unfavorable intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer. All underwent MRI of the lumbar column (T2Dixon) and pelvis (3DT2w, DWI, and T2 Dixon). The presence and location of lymph node and bone metastases were registered according to risk groups and radiological (rad) T-stage. The risk of lymph node metastases was assessed by odds ratio (OR).  Results:   We included 390 patients, of which 68% were high-risk and 32% were unfavorable intermediate-risk. In the high-risk group, the rate of regional- and non-regional lymph node metastases was 11% and 6%, respectively, and the rate of bone metastases was 10%. In the unfavorable intermediate-risk group, the rate of regional- and non-regional lymph node metastases was 4% and 0.8%, respectively, and the rate of bone metastases was 0.8%. Metastases occurred exclusively in the lumbar column in 0.5% of all patients, in the pelvis in 4%, and the pelvis and lumbar column in 3%. All patients with bone metastases had radT3-4, and patients with radT3-4 showed a four-fold increased risk of lymph node metastases (OR 4.48, 95% CI: 2.1-9.5).  Conclusion:   Bone metastases were found in 10% with high-risk prostate cancer and 0.8% with unfavorable intermediate-risk. Therefore, we question the recommendation to screen the unfavorable intermediate-risk group for bone metastases.  Key points:   • The rate of bone metastases was 10% in high-risk patients and 0.8% in the unfavorable intermediate-risk group. • The rate of lymph-node metastases was 17% in high-risk patients and 5% in the unfavorable intermediate-risk group. • No bone metastases were seen in radiologically localized disease.""","""['Erik Rud', 'Daniyal Noor', 'Kristina Flor Galtung', 'Fredrik Ottosson', 'Maciej Jacewicz', 'Eduard Baco', 'Peter Mæhre Lauritzen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '18Ffluoromethylcholine (FCH) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for lymph node staging of prostate cancer: a prospective study of 210 patients.', 'The prevalence and locations of bone metastases using whole-body MRI in treatment-naïve intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Direct comparison of choline PET/CT and MRI in the diagnosis of lymph node metastases in patients with prostate cancer.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.']"""

This study (NCT01750398) was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a treatment regimen consisting of a 6-month lead in-phase of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) followed by alternating 3-month intervals of bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) and ADT alone. Here we report > 5-year follow-up related to the duration of subsequent ADT, response to first-line androgen receptor inhibitors, safety, and survival in men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer treated on the BATMAN study.  Methods:   Univariate Cox regression was utilized to compare overall survival between Responders who achieved a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of <4 ng/ml and Non-Responders who achieved a PSA level of ≥4 ng/ml after BAT/ADT. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression were used to assess progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) on BAT and on subsequent abiraterone or enzalutamide and on the association between PSA peak during BAT and each time to event outcome.  Results:   Over median follow-up of 95 months, the median PFS on ADT for the entire cohort was 47.8. Median OS has not been reached (NR). Median OS for Non-Responders is 43 months versus NR (not reached) for responders (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.176, p = 0.002). Post-BAT, the PSA50 and PSA90 responses to abiraterone or enzalutamide were 94.4% and 66.7%, respectively and median PFS was 20.6 months. Patients with peak PSA level of ≥9 ng/ml after BAT had median PFS of 20.6 months versus NR for those having PSA < 9 ng/ml (HR: 0.122, p < 0.001). Median OS was 79.6 months for patients with PSA peak of ≥9 ng/ml versus NR for those having PSA peak of <9 ng/ml (HR: 0.409, p = 0.131).  Conclusion:   The use of BAT as part of first-line hormonal therapy strategy does not induce adversely affect long-term survival or induce any significant long-term adverse sequelae in patients with prostate cancer. Cycling BAT may extend the duration of ADT response and enhance response to subsequent androgen ablative therapies.

American Cancer Society depicts that the most common cancers are diagnosed in men and women in 2021. We aim to study socioeconomic inequalities in related cancers to investigate whether the cancer prevalence differs within the family income to poverty ratio (PIR).  Methods:   The study investigated data from adults aged 20-85 years participated in the 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who had complete data available on PIR and cancer or malignancy information (n = 49,720). Participants were stratified into 3 categories of PIR: high income (PIR ≥ 4), middle income (>1 and <4), or at or below the federal poverty level (≤1).  Results:   The prevalence of prostate cancer was higher in the middle-income (3.61% [n = 464]) and high-income groups (3.36% [n = 227]) than in the low-income group (1.83% [n = 84], all p < 0.001).

Patients and Methods. 50 PCa patients were enrolled on the experimental group from January 2020 to December 2021. 56 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) were selected as the control group at the same time. Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR was applied to investigate the miRNA-149 expression. PSA was detected by using a chemiluminescence meter using Abbott i4000. Applying bioinformatics analysis, we explored the expression of hsa-miR-149 in PCa in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic value, and the ROC curve was applied.  Results:   The expression level of miRNA-149 in the PCa group was significantly higher than that in the BPH group (P < 0.05). The PSA level in the PCa group was also significantly higher than that in the BPH group (P < 0.05). TCGA data analysis revealed that PCa tissues had significantly increased hsa-miR-149 expression. The results of survival analysis showed that patients with high expression of hsa-miR-149 had better prognosis. Additionally, the pathological N stage of PCa correlates with the hsa-miR-149 expression level (P = 0.002). According to ROC curve analysis, the region under the curve was 0.653, 95% CI: 0.576-0.730.  Conclusion:   High expression of serum miRNA-149 is associated with PCa patients.

CMV infects between 60% to 70% of adults in industrialized countries and close to 100% in emerging countries. Of all herpes viruses, CMV harbors the largest number of genes dedicated to evading innate and adaptive immunity in the host.

Furthermore, the prognosis is worse in African American as there is increased morbidity and mortality associated with it.  Purpose:   The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new online method to educate the patient population regarding prostate cancer risk, diagnosis, treatments, and their decisions about whether to be screened for the early detection of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Two hundred Black male patients are recruited from different clinical sites and randomized to either the control arm (usual care) or the intervention arm (educational program). We will compare the effectiveness of the intervention to see if patients are discussing the need of getting a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and the possible benefits and harms that may result of having or not having the test, with their primary care providers.  Discussion:   Shared decision-making (SDM) is the current standard in most cancer-screening guidelines and also a standard of person-centered care. However, there is a lack of evidence-based approaches to improve decision quality in clinical settings and an increased ambiguity of applying SDM for PSA-based screening among Black men in primary care. Our proposal to evaluate a decisional-aid intervention and measure the actual application of SDM during clinical encounters has a high potential to advance the translation path of implementing shared decision-making in clinical settings and provide evidence of the applicability of the guideline in general.  Innovation and overall impact:   Given the 2018 USPSTF updated guidelines recommending shared decision-making about PSA-based screening, the increased risk of prostate cancer mortality in Black men, the challenges of evidence-based decision-making due to the underrepresentation of Blacks in major randomized clinical trials, and implicit racial bias among primary care providers, the time is ripe for interventions to improve shared decision-making about prostate cancer screening in Black men. In this study, we address communication and knowledge gaps between Black men and their primary care providers. The intervention, if proven effective, can be readily scaled across primary care practices across the U.S. and may be adapted to other types of cancer where guidelines have included shared decision-making as well.

In the presence of competing events, various estimands have been suggested for defining the causal effect of treatment on the event of interest. Depending on the estimand, the competing events are either accommodated or eliminated, resulting in causal effects with different interpretations. The former approach captures the total effect of treatment on the event of interest while the latter approach captures the direct effect of treatment on the event of interest that is not mediated by the competing event. Separable effects have also been defined for settings where the treatment can be partitioned into two components that affect the event of interest and the competing event through different causal pathways.  Methods:   We outline various causal effects that may be of interest in the presence of competing events, including total, direct and separable effects, and describe how to obtain estimates using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv. Regression standardisation is applied by obtaining the average of individual estimates across all individuals in a study population after fitting a survival model.  Results:   With standsurv several contrasts of interest can be calculated including differences, ratios and other user-defined functions. Confidence intervals can also be obtained using the delta method. Throughout we use an example analysing a publicly available dataset on prostate cancer to allow the reader to replicate the analysis and further explore the different effects of interest.  Conclusions:   Several causal effects can be defined in the presence of competing events and, under assumptions, estimates of those can be obtained using regression standardisation with the Stata command standsurv.

Here we show that changes in chondroitin sulfate (CS), a major glycosaminoglycan component of the tumor cell glycocalyx and extracellular matrix, is AR-regulated and promotes the adaptive progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after ARPI. AR directly represses transcription of the 4-O-sulfotransferase gene CHST11 under basal androgen conditions, maintaining steady-state CS in prostate adenocarcinomas. When AR signaling is inhibited by ARPI or lost during progression to non-AR-driven CRPC as a consequence of lineage plasticity, CHST11 expression is unleashed, leading to elevated 4-O-sulfated chondroitin levels. Inhibition of the tumor cell CS glycocalyx delays CRPC progression, and impairs growth and motility of prostate cancer after ARPI.

Objective:   To develop and externally validate a scoring system for MRI-detected Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS)/Likert ≥3 lesions containing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).  Design, setting, and participants:   The multicentre Rapid Access to Prostate Imaging and Diagnosis (RAPID) pathway included 1189 patients referred to urology due to elevated age-specific prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE); April 27, 2017 to October 25, 2019.  Intervention:   Visual-registration or image-fusion targeted and systematic transperineal biopsies for an MRI score of ≥4 or 3 + PSA density ≥0.12 ng/ml/ml.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Fourteen variables were used in multivariable logistic regression for Gleason ≥3 + 4 (primary) and Gleason ≥4 + 3, and PROMIS definition 1 (any ≥4 + 3 or ≥6 mm any grade; secondary). Nomograms were created and a decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed. Models with varying complexity were externally validated in 2374 patients from six international cohorts.  Results and limitations:   The five-item Imperial RAPID risk score used age, PSA density, prior negative biopsy, prostate volume, and highest MRI score (corrected c-index for Gleason ≥3 + 4 of 0.82 and 0.80-0.86 externally). Incorporating family history, DRE, and Black ethnicity within the eight-item Imperial RAPID risk score provided similar outcomes. The DCA showed similar superiority of all models, with net benefit differences increasing in higher threshold probabilities. At 20%, 30%, and 40% of predicted Gleason ≥3 + 4 prostate cancer, the RAPID risk score was able to reduce, respectively, 11%, 21%, and 31% of biopsies against 1.8%, 6.2%, and 14% of missed csPCa (or 9.6%, 17%, and 26% of foregone biopsies, respectively).

PSMA PET/CT radiotracers are produced in-house (gallium-68, eg, 68Ga-PSMA-11) or provided by commercial entities (fluorine-18, eg, 18F-DCFPyL). Nevertheless, the cost per procedure is not well established given that current estimates have several limitations. This study aimed to establish the cost of PSMA PET/CT in Australia.  Methods:   Hospitals and diagnostic facilities currently conducting PSMA PET/CT in Australia in metropolitan and regional areas completed a survey of PSMA PET/CT throughput, radiotracers involved, and the cost of assets, departmental staffing, consumables, and occupancy. Total costs were estimated using a top-down microcosting approach, involving identifying all relevant cost components and valuing each component for the average patient, and a gross costing approach, involving apportioning cost components at an aggregated level.  Results:   Data were collected from 8 facilities. The most common radiotracer used was 18F-DCFPyL (7 facilities, 87%), followed by 68Ga-PSMA-11 (4 facilities, 50%). The average cost of PSMA PET/CT was A$1554.77 and A$1306.00 based on the microcosting and gross costing approaches, respectively.  Conclusions:   This study provides a detailed and accurate estimation of the cost of PSMA PET/CT in Australia. These costs can be used as a benchmark to identify potential efficiencies and help policy makers set the appropriate reimbursement rate for this procedure. The use of data from facilities using different radiotracers in metropolitan and regional areas and with different throughput increases the generalizability of the results, especially in countries with similar health systems.""","""['Bonny Parkinson', 'Rajan Sharma', 'Varinder Jeet', 'Rachel Song', 'Martin Hoyle']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Value Health Reg Issues""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Is Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging Cost-effective in Prostate Cancer: An Analysis Informed by the proPSMA Trial.', '18F-PSMA-11 Versus 68Ga-PSMA-11 Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Staging and Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective Double-blind Randomised Cross-over Trial.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients newly diagnosed and/or treated at Moffitt Cancer Center in December 2008-April 2020 with breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, colon cancer, prostate cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (NHL/CLL) (n = 29,156). History of KC was obtained from new patient intake questionnaires. Age- and stage-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the association between history of KC and survival following each cancer, stratified by demographic/clinical characteristics.  Results:   KC history was most prevalent in patients with melanoma (28.7%), CLL (19.8%) and lung cancer (16.1%). KC history was associated with better overall survival following prostate cancer (HR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.55-0.99) and poorer overall survival following CLL (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10-2.71). Patients with a history of KC experienced better survival within the first four years of a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67-0.92); whereas poorer survival was observed for patients who survived 7 + years after a melanoma diagnosis (HR = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.17-4.05).

However, the best treatment for more aggressive high-risk prostate cancer remains controversial. Insufficient infiltration capacity and dysfunction are commonly occurrences in engineered T lymphocytes expressing chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T), characterizing cancer immunotherapy failure. We conducted this study to investigate whether the combinative application of docetaxel and PSMA-CAR-T cells could be a more effective treatment to prostate cancer.  Methods:   Expressions of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on prostate cancer cells were examined by Flow cytometry. The efficaciousness of PSMA-CAR-T was evaluated in vitro using ELISA and RTCA. The effect of intermixed therapy was assessed in vivo utilizing a human prostate cancer liver metastasis mouse model and a human prostate cancer cell xenograft mouse model.  Results:   The outcome of cytokine discharge and cell killing assays demonstrated that PSMA-CAR-T cells have characteristic effector capacity against PSMA+ prostate cancer cells in vitro. Additionally, collaborative treatment of PSMA-CAR-T cells and docetaxel have cooperative efficacy in a mouse model of human prostate cancer. The merged strategy could be seen as an undeveloped avenue to augmenting adoptive CAR-T cell immunotherapy and mitigating the adverse side effects of chemotherapy.

Targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) using radiopharmaceuticals has shown promising results for PCa imaging as well as theranostics. 68 Ga-based PSMA imaging is limited by production of small quantities by generator, and it has led to quest for cyclotron produced 18 F-based PSMA ligands. In the current study, we evaluated the biodistribution and internal dosimetry of 18 F-PSMA-1007 and compared it with 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC.  Materials and methods:   A total of 8 patients with histopathologically proven PCa were included in the study, of whom 4 patients underwent 18 F-PSMA-1007, and the other 4 patients underwent 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC PET/CT. The biodistribution of both tracers was quantified for different organs by computing SUVs. All the patients underwent 5-point serial imaging to compute equivalent dose to essential organs and whole-body effective dose using OLINDA-based dosimetry.  Results:   The radiotracer uptake in brain, lacrimal gland, salivary gland, heart, lung, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, intestine, gluteal muscle, and bone marrow were found to be higher in 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET as compared with 68 Ga PSMA-11 PET. Kidney and urinary bladder showed higher SUV value on 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC as compared with 18 F-PSMA-1007.The whole-body effective dose from 18 F-PSMA-1007 (1.46E-02 mSv/MBq) was higher than 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC (1.03E-02 mSv/MBq). The highest mean equivalent dose from 18 F-PSMA-1007 was observed in the kidneys (1.48E-01 mGy/MBq), followed by spleen (mean, 1.06E-01 mGy/MBq) and liver (6.80E-02 mGy/MBq), whereas 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC equivalent dose was maximum in the kidneys (2.13E-01 mGy/MBq), followed by liver (3.03E-02 mGy/MBq), spleen (2.90E-02 mGy/MBq), adrenals (2.67E-02 mGy/MBq), and urinary bladder (1.89E-02 mGy/MBq).  Conclusion:   Whole-body effective dose from 18 F-PSMA-1007 is higher compared with 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC. 18 F-PSMA-1007 shows lesser urinary bladder clearance compared with 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC, which can allow better interpretation of prostatic bed without significant radioactive urine interference. 18 F-PSMA-1007 is a cyclotron-produced alternative to generator-produced 68 Ga-PSMA-11-HBED-CC and can emerge as a good diagnostic surrogate for patients planned for 177 Lu-PSMA-617 therapy.""","""['Priya Sharma', 'Ankit Watts', 'Harmandeep Singh']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of (68)Ga-PSMA HBED CC-a PSMA specific probe for PET imaging of prostate cancer.', 'Radiation dosimetry of (68)Ga-PSMA-11 (HBED-CC) and preliminary evaluation of optimal imaging timing.', 'Synthesis of 68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals using both generator-derived and cyclotron-produced 68Ga as exemplified by 68GaGa-PSMA-11 for prostate cancer PET imaging.', 'Good practices for 68Ga radiopharmaceutical production.', 'Can 18F-PSMA-7Q PET/CT replace prostate biopsy for the diagnosis of prostate cancer?-A single-center retrospective study.']"""

The accuracy of radiotherapy for patients with locally advanced cancer is compromised by independent motion of multiple targets. To date, MLC tracking approaches have used 2D geometric optimisation where the MLC aperture shape is simply translated to correspond to the target's motion, which results in sub-optimal delivered dose. To address this limitation, a dose-optimised multi-target MLC tracking method was developed and evaluated through simulated locally advanced prostate cancer treatments.Approach. A dose-optimised multi-target tracking algorithm that adapts the MLC aperture to minimise 3D dosimetric error was developed for moving prostate and static lymph node targets. A fast dose calculation algorithm accumulated the planned dose to the prostate and lymph node volumes during treatment in real time, and the MLC apertures were recalculated to minimise the difference between the delivered and planned dose with the included motion. Dose-optimised tracking was evaluated by simulating five locally advanced prostate plans and three prostate motion traces with a relative interfraction displacement. The same simulations were performed using geometric-optimised tracking and no tracking. The dose-optimised, geometric-optimised, and no tracking results were compared with the planned doses using a 2%/2 mmγcriterion.Main results. The mean dosimetric error was lowest for dose-optimised MLC tracking, withγ-failure rates of 12% ± 8.5% for the prostate and 2.2% ± 3.2% for the nodes. Theγ-failure rates for geometric-optimised MLC tracking were 23% ± 12% for the prostate and 3.6% ± 2.5% for the nodes. When no tracking was used, theγ-failure rates were 37% ± 28% for the prostate and 24% ± 3.2% for the nodes.Significance. This study developed a dose-optimised multi-target MLC tracking method that minimises the difference between the planned and delivered doses in the presence of intrafraction motion. When applied to locally advanced prostate cancer, dose-optimised tracking showed smaller errors than geometric-optimised tracking and no tracking for both the prostate and nodes.""","""['Emily A Hewson', 'Doan Trang Nguyen', 'Andrew Le', 'Jeremy T Booth', 'Paul J Keall', 'Lars Mejnertsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Adapting to the motion of multiple independent targets using multileaf collimator tracking for locally advanced prostate cancer: Proof of principle simulation study.', 'First experimental evaluation of multi-target multileaf collimator tracking during volumetric modulated arc therapy for locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Experimental investigation of dynamic real-time rotation-including dose reconstruction during prostate tracking radiotherapy.', 'Dose-based optimisation for multi-leaf collimator tracking during radiation therapy.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.', 'Assessment of intrafraction motion and its dosimetric impact on prostate radiotherapy using an in-house developed position monitoring system.']"""

There were no differences in overall survival (P = .53), disease-free survival (P = .21), or locoregional failure (P = .81). One year after RT, patients in the CRT arm experienced more high-level diarrhea frequency (5.8% IMRT v 15.1% CRT, P = .042) and a greater number had to take antidiarrheal medication two or more times a day (1.2% IMRT v 8.6% CRT, P = .036). At 3 years, women in the CRT arm reported a decline in urinary function, whereas the IMRT arm continued to improve (mean change in EPIC urinary score = 0.5, standard deviation = 13.0, IMRT v -6.0, standard deviation = 14.3, CRT, P = .005). In conclusion, IMRT reduces patient-reported chronic GI and urinary toxicity with no difference in treatment efficacy at 3 years.""","""['Anamaria R Yeung', 'Snehal Deshmukh', 'Ann H Klopp', 'Karen M Gil', 'Lari Wenzel', 'Shannon N Westin', 'Andre A Konski', 'David K Gaffney', 'William Small Jr', 'J Spencer Thompson', 'Desiree E Doncals', 'Guilherme H C Cantuaria', ""David P D'Souza"", 'Amy Chang', 'Vijayananda Kundapur', 'Dasarahally S Mohan', 'Michael L Haas', 'Yong Bae Kim', 'Catherine L Ferguson', 'Stephanie L Pugh', 'Lisa A Kachnic', 'Deborah W Bruner']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['Patient-Reported Toxicity During Pelvic Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy: NRG Oncology-RTOG 1203.', 'A randomized study of intensity-modulated radiation therapy versus three dimensional conformal radiation therapy for pelvic radiation in patients of post-operative treatment with gynecologic malignant tumor.', 'Late Toxicity After Adjuvant Conventional Radiation Versus Image-Guided Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy for Cervical Cancer (PARCER): A Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'Interventions to reduce acute and late adverse gastrointestinal effects of pelvic radiotherapy for primary pelvic cancers.', 'Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer: a systematic review and economic evaluation.', 'Evaluation of the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale version 1.1 (ESMO-MCBS v1.1) for adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer.', 'Editorial: Recent advances in cervical cancer radiotherapy.']"""

Our study assessed the feasibility of combining a urinary biomarker-based risk score (SelectMDx®) and multiparametric MRI outcomes in order to identify patients with prostate cancer on prostate biopsy with increased accuracy and reliability. Samples of 74 men with suspicion of prostate cancer and available multiparametric MRI were analysed in a prospective cross-sectional study design. First-voided urine for determination of HOXC6 and DLX1 mRNA levels was collected after digital rectal examination and prior to MRI/ultrasound fusion-guided prostate biopsy. All multiparametric MRI images were centrally reviewed by two experienced radiologists blinded for urine test results and biopsy outcome. The PI-RADS v2 was used. SelectMDx® score, PI-RADS and Gleason Sore were obtained. Associations between Gleason Score, PI-RADS scores and SelectMDx® were assessed using ANOVA and t-test. Sensitivity and specificity were assessed and evaluated as area-under-the-curve of the receiver operating characteristic. Upon biopsy, 59.5% of patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer, whereby 40.6% had high-grade prostate cancer (GS ≥ 7a). SelectMDx® scores were significantly higher for patients with positive biopsy findings (49.07 ± 25.99% vs. 22.00 ± 26.43%; p < 0.001). SelectMDx® scores increased with higher PI-RADS scores. Combining SelectMDx®, history of prior biopsy with benign histology and PI-RADS scores into a novel scoring system led to significant prostate cancer detection rates with tiered detection rate of 39%, 58%, 81% and 100% for Gleason grade group II, III, IV, and V, respectively. The area-under-the-curve for our novel sum score in receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.84. The synergistic combination of two non-invasive tests into a sum score with increased sensitivity may help avoiding unnecessary biopsies for initial prostate cancer diagnosis. For confirmation, further prospective studies with larger sample sizes and univariate and multivariate regression analyses and decision curve analyses are required.""","""['Olga Katzendorn', 'Christoph A J von Klot', 'Samy Mahjoub', 'Pouriya Faraj Tabrizi', 'Nina N Harke', 'Hossein Tezval', 'Susanne Hellms', 'Jörg Hennenlotter', 'Mirza S Baig', 'Arnulf Stenzl', 'Ferdinand Seith', 'Marcel Lafos', 'Markus A Kuczyk', 'Steffen Rausch', 'Inga Peters']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A urinary biomarker-based risk score correlates with multiparametric MRI for prostate cancer detection.', 'Combined Clinical Parameters and Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Advanced Risk Modeling of Prostate Cancer-Patient-tailored Risk Stratification Can Reduce Unnecessary Biopsies.', 'A SelectMDx/magnetic resonance imaging-based nomogram to diagnose prostate cancer.', 'Risk of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Associated With Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System Category 3 (Equivocal) Lesions Identified on Multiparametric Prostate MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'ExoDx prostate test as a predictor of outcomes of high-grade prostate cancer - an interim analysis.', 'PSMA PET-CT in the Diagnosis and Staging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   We investigated the associations of body mass index (BMI) and weight trajectories with the risk of liver cancer and BTC in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO). BMI was self-reported at ages 20, 50, and at enrollment. BMI trajectories were determined using latent class growth models. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   During a median follow-up of 15.9 years among 138,922 participants, 170 liver cancer and 143 BTC cases were identified.

A comprehensive assessment of cancer disparities comparing Asian with Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations is lacking.  Objective:   To compare comorbidity burden and survival among East Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, South Asian, and Southeast Asian individuals with non-Hispanic White individuals with cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study used a national hospital-based oncology database enriched with Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander and Asian populations. Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, and White individuals diagnosed with the most common cancers who received treatment from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2017, were included. Patients younger than 18 years, without pathologic confirmation of cancer, or with metastatic disease were excluded. Data were analyzed from January to May 2022.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end points were comorbidity burden by Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index and overall survival (OS).  Results:   In total, 5 955 550 patients were assessed, including 60 047 East Asian, 11 512 Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 25 966 South Asian, 42 815 Southeast Asian, and 5 815 210 White patients. The median (IQR) age was 65 (56-74) years, median (IQR) follow-up was 58 (30-96) months, and 3 384 960 (57%) were women. Patients were predominantly from metropolitan areas (4 834 457 patients [84%]) and the Southern United States (1 987 506 patients [34%]), with above median education (3 576 460 patients [65%]), and without comorbidities (4 603 386 patients [77%]). Cancers included breast (1 895 351 patients [32%]), prostate (948 583 patients [16%]), kidney or bladder (689 187 patients [12%]), lung (665 622 patients [11%]), colorectal (659 165 patients [11%]), melanoma (459 904 patients [8%]), endometrial (307 401 patients [5%]), lymphoma (245 003 patients [4%]), and oral cavity (85 334 patients [1%]) malignant neoplasms. Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander patients had the highest comorbidity burden (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.47-1.94) compared with Asian and White groups. Asian patients had superior OS compared with White patients for most cancers; only Southeast Asian patients with lymphoma had inferior survival (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.37). In contrast, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander patients demonstrated inferior OS compared with Asian and White patients for oral cavity cancer (aHR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.14-2.13), lymphoma (aHR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.11-1.63), endometrial cancer (aHR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.12-1.50), prostate cancer (aHR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.14-1.46), and breast cancer (aHR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.18). No cancers among Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander patients had superior OS compared with White patients.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort study, compared with White patients with the most common cancers, Asian patients had superior survival outcomes while Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander patients had inferior survival outcomes. Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander patients had significantly greater comorbidity burden compared with Asian and White patients, but this alone did not explain the poor survival outcomes.

Background:   Epidemiological studies show an inconsistent association between cancer and osteoporosis. We examined the association between a prior cancer diagnosis and osteoporosis in population-based data.  Methods:   We performed an age- and sex-matched case-control study (1:2 matching ratio) using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2011-2018. Cases were determined by self-reported prior diagnosis of cancer; all controls were free of cancer at the time of bone density measurement with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. We defined osteoporosis as a T-score ≤ - 2.5 at femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine. Unconditional multivariable logistic regression was used to test the association between a prior cancer diagnosis and osteoporosis.  Results:   We identified 246 prior cancer cases and 492 controls (mean age: 65.8 years) in females, and 243 prior cancer cases and 486 controls (mean age: 68.0 years) in males. The most common types of cancer in females and males were breast cancer and prostate cancer, respectively.

A deep learning PCa detection model was developed to produce a heatmap of all PIRADS ≥ 2 lesions across prior and current studies. The heatmaps for each patient's prior and current examination were used to extract differential volumetric and likelihood features reflecting explainable changes between examinations. A machine learning classifier was trained to predict from these features csPCa (ISUP > 1) at the current examination according to biopsy. A classifier trained on the current study only was developed for comparison. An extended classifier was developed to incorporate clinical parameters (PSA, PSA density, and age). The cross-validated diagnostic accuracies were compared using ROC analysis. The diagnostic performance of the best model was compared to the radiologist scores.  Results:   The model including prior and current study (AUC 0.81, CI: 0.69, 0.91) resulted in a higher (p = 0.04) diagnostic accuracy than the current only model (AUC 0.73, CI: 0.61, 0.84).

Strand breaks recruit and activate PARP1 and 2, which rapidly generate PAR from NAD+. PAR promotes the recruitment of other repair factors, relaxes chromatin, and has a role in DNA repair, transcription regulation, and RNA biology. Four PARP1/2 dual inhibitors are currently used to treat BRCA-deficient breast, ovarian, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. In addition to blocking the enzymatic activity of PARP1 and 2, clinical PARP inhibitors extend the appearance of PARP1 and PARP2 on chromatin after damage, termed trapping. Loss of PARP1 confers resistance to PARP inhibitors, suggesting an essential role of trapping in cancer therapy. Yet, whether the persistent PARP1 and 2 foci at the DNA damage sites are caused by the retention of the same molecules or by the continual exchange of different molecules remains unknown.

The online tool ""Gene-RADAR"" was applied to investigate the interaction among SIRT1, the TP53 gene and miR-34a-5p. We found that SIRT1 was up-regulated in cancer tissues from patients diagnosed with prostate and castration-resistant prostate cancer when compared to healthy controls. Pearson analysis indicated a positive correlation between SIRT1 and miR-34a-5p, while data mining on the TargetScan database predicted the binding site between the two. An apoptosis assay of prostate cancer cells (PRAD) confirmed that the overexpression of miR-34a-5p inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis verified that miR-34a-5p overexpression blocked PRAD cells in the G2/S phase of the cell cycle. Moreover, the Western blotting (WB) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-34a-5p induced down-regulation of the SIRT-related proteins HIF2α and PGC1α, while on the contrary, it up-regulated the expression of two tumour suppressor genes, TP53 and VEGF.

The down-modulation of the STAT3 signaling cascade decreased the expression of anti-proliferative as well as anti-apoptotic genes and proteins, leading to the inhibition of cell migration and apoptotic cell death. PMEO treatment induced a rapid drop in glutathione (GSH) levels and an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, resulting in mild oxidative stress. Pretreatment of cells with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a cell-permeable ROS scavenger, reverted the inhibitory action of PMEO on STAT3 phosphorylation.

Two calibrated nomograms (one for each outcome) were constructed on significant predictors at multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 107 patients with a median age of 55 years at presentation were included; 47% stopped or continued phytotherapy, while 53% switched to alpha-blockers and/or 5-ARI after a median time of 24 months. One-third in the second group experienced clinical progression after a median time of 54 months. Age, symptom score, peak flow rate (Qmax), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and post-void residual volume were significantly associated with the outcomes. According to our nomograms, patients switching therapy or progressing clinically had average scores of 75% and 40% in the dedicated nomograms, respectively, as compared to 25% and <5% in patients who did not reach any outcome. Conclusions: We developed a nomogram to predict the risk of pharmaceutical or surgical interventions for BPH-related LUTS at 10 years from presentation. On the basis of our models, thresholds of >75% and >40% for high risk and <25% and <5% for low risk of pharmaceutical or surgical interventions, respectively, can be proposed.""","""['Lorenzo G Luciani', 'Daniele Mattevi', 'Daniele Ravanelli', 'Umberto Anceschi', 'Guido Giusti', 'Tommaso Cai', 'Umberto Rozzanigo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Environ Res Public Health""","""['Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.', 'Phytotherapy for male luts: What happens then? 10-year research.', 'Efficacy and safety of a hexanic extract of Serenoa repens (Permixon® ) for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (LUTS/BPH): systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies.', 'Observational database serenoa repens (DOSSER): overview, analysis and results.

The study cohort comprised residents of Queensland, Australia, diagnosed with a first primary malignancy between 1997 and 2015. Administrative databases were linked with cancer registry records to capture all health service utilization. Health service costs between 2013-2016 were analyzed using a bottom-up costing approach. The cumulative mean annual healthcare expenditure (2013-2016) for the cohort of N = 230,380 individuals was AU$3.66 billion. The highest costs were incurred by patients with a history of prostate (AU$538 m), breast (AU$496 m) or colorectal (AU$476 m) cancers. Costs by time since diagnosis were typically highest in the first year after diagnosis and decreased over time. Overall mean annual healthcare costs per person (2013-2016) were AU$15,889 (SD: AU$25,065) and highest costs per individual were for myeloma (AU$45,951), brain (AU$30,264) or liver cancer (AU$29,619) patients.

LSCmed cells defines an FACS-enriched population of castration-tolerant luminal progenitor cells that has been proposed to promote tumorigenesis and CRPC in Pten-deficient mice. The goals of this study were to assess the relevance of LSCmed cells through the analysis of their molecular proximity with luminal progenitor-like cell clusters identified by single-cell (sc)RNA-seq analyses of mouse and human prostates, and to investigate their regulation by in silico-predicted growth factors present in the prostatic microenvironment. Methods: Several bioinformatic pipelines were used for pan-transcriptomic analyses. LSCmed cells isolated by cell sorting from healthy and malignant mouse prostates were characterized using RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence and organoid assays. Results: LSCmed cells match (i) mouse luminal progenitor cell clusters identified in scRNA-seq analyses for which we provide a common 15-gene signature including the previously identified LSCmed marker Krt4, and (ii) Club/Hillock cells of the human prostate. This transcriptional overlap was maintained in cancer contexts. EGFR/ERBB4, IGF-1R and MET pathways were identified as autocrine/paracrine regulators of progenitor, proliferation and differentiation properties of LSCmed cells. The functional redundancy of these signaling pathways allows them to bypass the effect of receptor-targeted pharmacological inhibitors.

Methods and results:   In the present study, we found that EVs derived from 3T3-L1 adipocytes could affect PC3 and DU145 PCa cell traits, inducing increased proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, conditioning of both PCa cell lines with adipocyte-released EVs resulted in lower sensitivity to docetaxel, with reduced phosphatidylserine externalization and decreased caspase 3 and PARP cleavage. In particular, these alterations were paralleled by an Akt/HIF-1α axis-related Warburg effect, characterized by enhanced glucose consumption, lactate release and ATP production.

All however, were developed in the pre-MRI era. Here we compared categorisation of cancers using either only clinical parameters or with MRI enhanced information in men referred for suspected prostate cancer from an unscreened population.  Patient and methods:   Data from men referred from primary care to our diagnostic service and with both clinical (digital rectal examination [DRE] and systematic biopsies) and MRI enhanced attributes (MRI stage and combined systematic/targeted biopsies) were used for this study. Clinical vs MRI data were contrasted for clinico-pathological and risk group re-distribution using the European Association of Urology (EAU), American Urological Association (AUA) and UK National Institute for Health Care Excellence (NICE) Cambridge Prognostic Group (CPG) models. Differences were retrofitted to a population cohort with long-term prostate cancer mortality (PCM) outcomes to simulate impact on model performance. We further contrasted individualised overall survival (OS) predictions using the Predict Prostate algorithm.  Results:   Data from 370 men were included (median age 66y). Pre-biopsy MRI stage reassignments occurred in 7.8% (versus DRE). Image-guided biopsies increased Grade Group 2 and ≥ Grade Group 3 assignments in 2.7% and 2.9% respectively. The main change in risk groups was more high-risk cancers (6.2% increase in the EAU and AUA system, 4.3% increase in CPG4 and 1.9% CPG5). When extrapolated to a historical population-based cohort (n = 10,139) the redistribution resulted in generally lower concordance indices for PCM. The 5-tier NICE-CPG system outperformed the 4-tier AUA and 3-tier EAU models (C Index 0.70 versus 0.65 and 0.64). Using an individualised prognostic model, changes in predicted OS were small (median difference 1% and 2% at 10- and 15-years' respectively). Similarly, estimated treatment survival benefit changes were minimal (1% at both 10- and 15-years' time frame).  Conclusion:   MRI guided diagnostics does change pre-treatment risk groups assignments but the overall prognostic impact appears modest in men referred from unscreened populations. Particularly, when using more granular tiers or individualised prognostic models. Existing risk and prognostic models can continue to be used to counsel men about treatment option until long term survival outcomes are available.""","""['Artitaya Lophatananon', 'Matthew H V Byrne', 'Tristan Barrett', 'Anne Warren', 'Kenneth Muir', 'Ibifuro Dokubo', 'Fanos Georgiades', 'Mostafa Sheba', 'Lisa Bibby', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The Cambridge Prognostic Groups for improved prediction of disease mortality at diagnosis in primary non-metastatic prostate cancer: a validation study.', 'Improving Clinical Risk Stratification at Diagnosis in Primary Prostate Cancer: A Prognostic Modelling Study.', 'Application of a novel machine learning framework for predicting non-metastatic prostate cancer-specific mortality in men using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

All patients underwent computed tomography and a bone scan or 18F- or prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted positron emission tomography. Patients received local external beam radiation therapy to the prostate to achieve local control (60-81.4 Gy to the prostate, and 45-50.4 Gy to pelvic lymph nodes), with either the 3D conformal (4-field box) or volumetric modulated arc therapy technique.

The NIR probe PSMA-Cy7.5_2 demonstrated a high affinity for PSMA (i.e. IC50 = 58.8 nM) and was further studied in mouse xenograft models of prostate cancer, to assess its ability to image PSMA positive tumour tissues. While PSMA-Cy7.5_2 out-performed PSMA-IRDye800CW in vitro, its tumour accumulation in vivo was not as evident. Further micellar aggregation studies indicated that the relatively higher hydrophobic property of PSMA-Cy7.5_2 may lower its bioavailability and tissue distribution following systemic injection, limiting its ability of targeting PSMA tumour in vivo.

To assess the functional significance of ERF loss, we generated ES cell lines with increased expression of ERF and lines with knockdown of ERF. We assessed cell viability, clonogenic growth, and motility in these ES lines and performed transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses. Finally, we validated our findings in vivo using cell line xenografts.  Results:   Novel subsets were defined by recurrent secondary alterations in ERF, which encodes an ETS domain transcriptional repressor, in 7% of patients (five truncating mutations, one deep deletion, and two missense mutations) and in FGFR1 in another 2.7% (one amplification and two known activating mutations). ERF alterations were nonoverlapping with STAG2 alterations. In vitro, increased expression of ERF decreased tumor cell growth, colony formation, and motility in two ES cell lines, whereas ERF loss induced cellular proliferation and clonogenic growth. Transcriptomic analysis of cell lines with ERF loss revealed an increased expression of genes and pathways associated with aggressive tumor biology, and epigenetic, chromatin-based studies revealed that ERF competes with EWSR1-FLI1 at ETS-binding sites.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of patients who underwent RC between 2006 and 2019. Females, non-TCC cases and patients with neo-bladder diversions were excluded. Histological prostatic urethral involvement at the time of RC was deemed high risk for UR. Carcinoma in-situ, multifocal tumours and bladder neck involvement were deemed intermediate risk and the absence of the above features was considered low risk.  Results:   417 patients underwent RC, 300 cases remained after exclusion criteria were applied. 42 patients were high-risk for UR, 102 patients were intermediate risk and 156 were low risk. Of the 300, 24 urethrectomy cases were recorded. Six cases of UR occurred. Of these, 5 presented with symptoms and only 1 case was detected by surveillance.

As a result, early and precise diagnosis of urinary system cancers is important for prevention and therapy. Histopathology is now the golden stan-dard for the diagnosis, but it is invasive, time-consuming, and inconvenient for initial diagnosis and re-gular follow-up assessment. Endoscopy can directly witness the tumor's structure, but intrusive detection is likely to cause harm to the patient's organs, and it is apt to create other hazards in frequently examined patients. Imaging is a valuable non-invasive and quick assessment tool; however, it can be difficult to define the type of lesions and has limited sensitivity for early tumor detection. The conventional approaches for detecting tumors have their own set of limitations. Thus, detection methods that combine non-invasive detection, label-free detection, high sensitivity and high specificity are urgently needed to aid clinical diagnosis. Optical diagnostics and imaging are increasingly being employed in healthcare settings in a variety of sectors. Raman scattering can assess changes in molecular signatures in cancer cells or tissues based on the interaction with vibrational modes of common molecular bonds. Due to the advantages of label-free, strong chemical selectivity, and high sensitivity, Raman scattering, especially coherent Raman scattering microscopy imaging with high spatial resolution, has been widely used in biomedical research. And quantity studies have shown that it has a good application in the detection and diagnosis of bladder can-cer, renal clear cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, and other cancers. In this paper, several nonlinear imaging techniques based on Raman scattering technology are briefly described, including Raman spectroscopy, coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering, stimulated Raman scattering, and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. And we will discuss the application of these techniques for detecting urologic malignancy. Future research directions are predicted using the advantages and limitations of the aforesaid methodologies in the research. For clinical practice, Raman scattering technology is intended to enable more accurate, rapid, and non-invasive in early diagnosis, intraoperative margins, and pathological grading basis for clinical practice.""","""['Z Hao', 'S H Yue', 'L Q Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Label-free brain tumor imaging using Raman-based methods.', 'Fast vibrational imaging of single cells and tissues by stimulated Raman scattering microscopy.', 'Differential diagnosis of lung carcinoma with coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging.', 'Coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering microscopy: overcoming technical barriers for clinical translation.', 'Label-free analysis of cellular biochemistry by Raman spectroscopy and microscopy.']"""

To investigate the efficacy and safety of bipolar androgen therapy (BAT) followed by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In August 2020, Beijing Hospital conducted an investigator-initiated study: Bipolar androgen therapy followed by immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. Up to now, the study has included 4 patients who completed the entire cycle of treatment. The mean age of the patients was 74.5 (68 to 82) years old, the mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 20.8 (9.9 to 8.36) μg/L, the mean testosterone was 0.50 (0.00 to 1.81) μg/L, and the Gleason score were 10 and 9, 7, 7 respectively. The pain scale score before treatment was 1.5 (1 to 2). In this study, 4 patients completed the entire cycle of treatment, and the treatment effect of the patients showed great heterogeneity. PSA in case 1 decreased from 24.0 μg/L to 0.47 μg/L, testosterone increased from 0.175 6 μg/L to 2.62 μg/L. PSA in case 2 increased from 9.939 μg/L to 168.536 μg/L, and testosterone increased from 0.0 μg/L increased to 2.85 μg/L. PSA increased from 13.31 μg/L to 39.278 μg/L in case 3, testosterone increased from 0.0 μg/L to 2.54 μg/L. and PSA increased from 36.0 μg/L to 350.2 μg/L in the case 4, testosterone increased from 1.81 μg/L to 3.85 μg/L. Except for one patient who showed significant PSA remission, the PSA levels of the remaining three patients remained high overall. There were no adverse reactions reported in 4 patients. In the follow-up, case 1 continued to use PD-1 monoclonal antibody (median progression free survival time was 10 months). Two patients who had previously been resistant to enzalutamide received enzalutamide again after the whole cycle of treatment, and their PSA decreased again, which indicated that the patient was sensitive to enzalutamide again. BAT had a certain therapeutic effect on mCRPC patients, and the safety was controllable. Its tumor control effect still needed long-term follow-up verification in large-sample clinical trials. BAT has a certain therapeutic effect on mCRPC patient, especially the resensitivity of tumors to enzalutamide can be restored. Immune checkpoint inhibitors may have therapeutic potential in patients with prostate cancer treated with BAT and enzalutamide.""","""['S J Liu', 'H M Hou', 'Z T Lv', 'X Ding', 'L Wang', 'L Zhang', 'M Liu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Beijing Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Bipolar androgen therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after progression on enzalutamide: an open-label, phase 2, multicohort study.', 'A Multicohort Open-label Phase II Trial of Bipolar Androgen Therapy in Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (RESTORE): A Comparison of Post-abiraterone Versus Post-enzalutamide Cohorts.', 'TRANSFORMER: A Randomized Phase II Study Comparing Bipolar Androgen Therapy Versus Enzalutamide in Asymptomatic Men With Castration-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Our aim was to investigate the value of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in PCa with inconclusive disease stage based on standard imaging.  Methods:   We made a single-center study of patients with newly diagnosed PCa who underwent a 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT due to equivocal findings or discrepancies between BS and CT from 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2020.

The proposed statistical approach describes the health status of this group by estimating the probabilities of death among prevalent cases. The application concerns colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers and melanoma in France in 2017.  Methods:   Excess mortality was used to estimate the probabilities of death from cancer and other causes.  Results:   For the studied cancers, most deaths from cancer occurred during the first 5 years after diagnosis. The probability of death from cancer decreased with increasing time since diagnosis except for breast cancer, for which it remained relatively stable. The time beyond which the probability of death from cancer became lower than that from other causes depended on age and cancer site: for colorectal cancer, it was 6 years after diagnosis for women (7 years for men) aged 75-84 and 20 years for women (18 years for men) aged 45-54 years, whereas cancer was the major cause of death for women younger than 75 years whatever the time since diagnosis for breast and for all patients younger than 75 years for lung cancer. In contrast, deaths from other causes were more frequent in all the patients older than 75 years. Apart from breast cancer in women younger than 55 years and lung cancer in women older than 55 years and men older than 65 years, the probability of death from cancer among prevalent cases fell below 1%, with varying times since diagnosis.

The normalized T2 signal (nT2), ADC measurement, mean early-phase DCE signal (mDCE), and heuristic DCE parameters were calculated. Logistic regression analysis indicated the most predictive DCE parameters for csPCa (Gleason grade group ≥2). Receiver operating characteristic parameter models were compared using the Obuchowski test. Recursive partitioning analysis determined ADC and mDCE value ranges for combined use with PI-RADS. Results Overall, 260 men (median age, 64 years [IQR, 58-69 years]) with 432 lesions (csPCa [n = 152] and no csPCa [n = 280]) were included. The mDCE parameter was predictive of csPCa when accounting for the ADC and nT2 parameter in the peripheral zone (odds ratio [OR], 1.76; 95% CI: 1.30, 2.44; P = .001) but not the transition zone (OR, 1.17; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.69; P = .41). Recursive partitioning analysis selected an ADC cutoff of 0.897 × 10-3 mm2/sec (P = .04) as a classifier for peripheral zone lesions with a PI-RADS score assessed on the ADC map (hereafter, ADC PI-RADS) of 3. The mDCE parameter did not differentiate ADC PI-RADS 3 lesions (P = .11), but classified lesions with ADC PI-RADS scores greater than 3 with low ADC values (less than 0.903 × 10-3 mm2/sec, P < .001) into groups with csPCa rates of 70% and 97% (P = .008). A lesion size cutoff of 1.5 cm and qualitative DCE parameters were not defined as classifiers according to recursive partitioning (P > .05). Conclusion Quantitative or qualitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was not relevant for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3 lesion risk stratification, while quantitative apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were helpful in upgrading PI-RADS 3 and PI-RADS 4 lesions. Quantitative ADC measurement may be more important for risk stratification than current methods in future versions of PI-RADS. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article See also the editorial by Goh in this issue.""","""['Anoshirwan Andrej Tavakoli', 'Thomas Hielscher', 'Patrick Badura', 'Magdalena Görtz', 'Tristan Anselm Kuder', 'Regula Gnirs', 'Constantin Schwab', 'Markus Hohenfellner', 'Heinz-Peter Schlemmer', 'David Bonekamp']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiology""","""['Tumor Physiology and Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Apparent Diffusion Coefficient and Lesion Volume to Detect Prostate Cancer.', 'Prospective Evaluation of PI-RADS Version 2.1 for Prostate Cancer Detection and Investigation of Multiparametric MRI-derived Markers.', 'Which clinical and radiological characteristics can predict clinically significant prostate cancer in PI-RADS 3 lesions?

Methods:   We investigated glycolysis reprogramming and MPC changes in patients with PCa by using metabolic profiling, RNA-Seq, and tissue microarrays. Transient blockade of pyruvate influx into mitochondria was observed in cellular studies to detect its different effects on prostate carcinoma cells and benign prostate cells. Xenograft mouse models were injected with an MPC inhibitor to evaluate the sensitivity of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography and radiotherapy of PCa. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of this different effect of transient blockage towards benign prostate cells and prostate cancer cells was studied in vitro.  Results:   MPC was elevated in PCa tissue compared with benign prostate tissue, but decreased during cancer progression. The transient blockade increased PCa cell proliferation while decreasing benign prostate cell proliferation, thus increasing the sensitivity of PCa cells to 18F-PET/CT (SUVavg, P = 0.016; SUVmax, P = 0.03) and radiotherapy (P < 0.01). This differential effect of MPC on PCa and benign prostate cells was dependent on regulation by a VDAC1-MPC-mitochondrial homeostasis-glycolysis pathway.  Conclusions:   Blockade of pyruvate influx into mitochondria increased glycolysis levels in PCa but not in non-carcinoma prostate tissue. This transient blockage sensitized PCa to both detection and radiotherapy, thus indicating that glycolytic potential is a novel mechanism underlying PCa progression. The change in the mitochondrial pyruvate influx caused by transient MPC blockade provides a critical target for PCa diagnosis and treatment.""","""['Huan Xu#', 'Junyi Chen#', 'Zhi Cao', 'Xi Chen', 'Caihong Huang', 'Jin Ji', 'Yalong Xu', 'Junfeng Jiang', 'Yue Wang', 'Guowang Xu', 'Lina Zhou', 'Jingyi He', 'Xuedong Wei', 'Jason Boyang Wu', 'Zhong Wang', 'Shancheng Ren', 'Fubo Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Biol Med""","""['Mitochondrial pyruvate import is a metabolic vulnerability in androgen receptor-driven prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'A novel KDM5A/MPC-1 signaling pathway promotes pancreatic cancer progression via redirecting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism.', 'Heart failure-emerging roles for the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier.', 'The Multifaceted Pyruvate Metabolism: Role of the Mitochondrial Pyruvate Carrier.', 'Differences in the pathogenetic characteristics of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zones and the possible molecular biological mechanisms.']"""

Thus, we conducted this research to discover the histologic-grading accuracy of needle biopsy specimens, and to identify preoperative clinical and pathological factors that predict upgrading and downgrading from biopsy to radical prostatectomy specimen.  Patients and methods:   This study was performed on 570 patients who were referred to the medical centers affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and underwent radical prostatectomy from 2013 to 2017. Concordance was evaluated between the Gleason score of needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimens. Predictors of upgrades and downgrades were assessed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.  Results:   Scores were the same in 50% of cases, downgraded in 26%, and upgraded in 24%. The variables predicting a Gleason score upgrade were higher Prostate specific antigen level, larger tumors, and older age. Lower tumor volume, lower Prostate specific antigen, and low maximum percentage of cancer in cores were predictors of downgrading from Gleason score>6 to ⩽6. Also, Body mass index>30, smaller tumor size, and negative lymph nodes were predictors of downgrading from Gleason score>7 to 7.  Conclusion:   The correlation between biopsy and Radical prostatectomy Gleason scores was only 50%. After dividing them into the new grading groups, this coordination increased by only 5.6%.

Currently, MR-guided prostate biopsy (in-bore biopsy) is the only biopsy method that uses real-time MRI in patients with suspected prostate cancer. The aim of the study was a retrospective analysis of the correlation between MRI results and histological findings of prostate samples suspected of malignancy, which were taken during MRI-guided biopsy.  Material and methods:   Thirty-nine patients with 57 lesion biopsies were enrolled in the study. Patients were aged 48-84 years (mean age 67.2 ± 9.4 years).  Results:   Cancer was histologically confirmed in 24 lesions, including primary cancer in 14 lesions and local recurrence in 10 lesions. Cancer was not detected in the remaining lesions (n = 33). Malignancy was confirmed in 90% of lesions previously reported as PI-RADS 5. Only one Prostate Imaging and Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS 5) lesion was histologically negative (prostatitis). Cancer was detected in 50% of lesions defined as PI-RADS 4. Cancer cells were not found in any of 23 lesions defined as PI-RADS 3 (53.5%). Most of the lesions assessed as PI-RADS 3 were located in the transitional zone (n = 19). Only four PI-RADS 3 lesions were found in the peripheral zone. Large lesions or lesions feasible for cognitive TRUS biopsy were not referred for MRI biopsy, which resulted in a higher proportion of lesions assessed as PI-RADS 3. Fourteen lesions suspected of local recurrence were assessed in our study. Cancer was found in approximately 72% of the lesions.  Conclusions:   Performing prostate biopsy under the guidance of real-time MRI allows precise collection of material for histological examination (even from a very small lesion). As a result, both primary cancer and local recurrence after previous radiotherapy of prostate cancer can be confirmed.""","""['Justyna Rembak-Szynkiewicz', 'Piotr Wojcieszek', 'Anna Hebda', 'Patrycja Mazgaj', 'Arkadiusz Badziński', 'Gabriela Stasik-Pres', 'Ewa Chmielik', 'Barbara Bobek-Billewicz']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Endokrynol Pol""","""['Central zone lesions on magnetic resonance imaging: Should we be concerned?', 'Comparison between target magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in-gantry and cognitively directed transperineal or transrectal-guided prostate biopsies for Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 3-5 MRI lesions.', 'Targeted MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy in men with previous prostate biopsies using a novel registration software and multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores: first results.', 'Prostate Indeterminate Lesions on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Biopsy Versus Surveillance: A Literature Review.', 'Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Targeted Biopsy in Patients with a Prior Negative Biopsy: A Consensus Statement by AUA and SAR.']"""

The Blade Study""","""Context:   As patients are now living with prostate cancer for longer, the long-term impact of hormonal treatment on bone health is an increasingly debated subject.  Objective:   To characterize the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers after degarelix administration in prostate cancer patients without bone metastases. To explore the predictive role of body composition on treatment induced bone loss.  Methods:   BMD and body composition (lean body mass, fat body mass, and appendicular mass index [ALMI]) were assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry on study entry and after 12 months of degarelix therapy. Alkaline phosphate (ALP) and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were assessed at baseline, and 6 and 12 months.  Results:   Twenty-nine patients entered the study. Degarelix administration was associated with a significant decrease in BMD after 12 months (2.4% reduction from baseline at lumbar spine). Serum CTX and ALP increased significantly (median increase from baseline 99% and 19.3%, respectively). An inverse correlation was observed between ALMI and CTX, but not ALP, at both baseline (Pearson r = -0.62, P < .0001) and month 12 (Pearson r = -0.41, P = .032). Moreover, a significant inverse correlation between changes in ALMI and CTX at 12 months (Pearson r = -0.43, P = .019) and a direct relationship between changes of ALMI and ALP (Pearson r = 0.44, P = .016) during degarelix therapy were observed.  Conclusion:   Degarelix administration is associated with a significant decrease in BMD and increase in bone turnover markers. ALMI is a promising predictor of bone loss in prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy, and ALMI changes during therapy are associated with bone turnover derangement favoring bone quality alterations.""","""['Carlotta Palumbo', 'Alberto Dalla Volta', 'Stefania Zamboni', 'Gherardo Mazziotti', 'Manuel Zamparini', 'Luca Triggiani', 'Paolo Borghetti', 'Filippo Maffezzoni', 'Roberto Bresciani', 'Luca Rinaudo', 'Francesca Valcamonico', 'Davide Farina', 'Stefano Maria Magrini', 'Alessandro Antonelli', 'Claudio Simeone', 'Alfredo Berruti']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Clin Endocrinol Metab""","""['Changes in bone mineral density, lean body mass and fat content as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry in patients with prostate cancer without apparent bone metastases given androgen deprivation therapy.', 'Changes in body composition and lipid profile in prostate cancer patients without bone metastases given Degarelix treatment: the BLADE prospective cohort study.', 'Correlation between salivary and serum markers of bone turnover in osteopenic rats.', 'Does Diet-Induced Weight Loss Lead to Bone Loss in Overweight or Obese Adults?

This disparity is due in part to discrepancies in socioeconomic status and access to quality care. Studies also suggest that differences in the prevalence of innate immune cells and heightened function in the tumor microenvironment of Black men may promote PCa aggressiveness.  Methods:   We evaluated the spatial localization of and quantified CD66ce+ neutrophils by immunohistochemistry and CD68+ (pan), CD80+ (M1), and CD163+ (M2) macrophages by RNA in situ hybridization on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from organ donor ""normal"" prostate (n = 9) and radical prostatectomy (n = 38) tissues from Black and White men. Neutrophils were quantified in PCa and matched benign tissues in tissue microarray (TMA) sets comprised of 560 White and 371 Black men. Likewise, macrophages were quantified in TMA sets comprised of tissues from 60 White and 120 Black men. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and ETS transcription factor ERG (ERG) expression status of each TMA PCa case was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Finally, neutrophils and macrophage subsets were assessed in a TMA set comprised of distant metastatic PCa tissues collected at autopsy (n = 6) sampled across multiple sites.  Results:   CD66ce+ neutrophils were minimal in normal prostates, but were increased in PCa compared to benign tissues, in low grade compared to higher grade PCa, in PCa tissues from White compared to Black men, and in PCa with PTEN loss or ERG positivity. CD163+ macrophages were the predominant macrophage subset in normal organ donor prostate tissues from both Black and White men and were significantly more abundant in organ donor compared to prostatectomy PCa tissues. CD68,+ CD80,+ and CD163+ macrophages were significantly increased in cancer compared to benign tissues and in cancers with ERG positivity. CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages were increased in higher grade cancers compared to low grade cancer and CD80 expression was significantly higher in benign prostatectomy tissues from Black compared to White men.

Here, we developed a novel microRNA (miRNA)-based prognostic model for patients who underwent radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   We retrospectively investigated the clinical records of 295 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy between 2009 and 2017. We randomly assigned these cases into training or validation sets. The prognostic model was constructed using Fisher linear discriminant analysis in the training set, and we evaluated its performance in the validation set.

A prediction model was constructed using a combination of three miRNAs (miR-3147, miR-4513, and miR-4728-5p) and two pathological factors (pathological T stage and Gleason score). In the validation set, the predictive performance of the model was confirmed to be accurate (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.80; sensitivity: 0.78; specificity: 0.76). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the patients with a low prediction index had significantly longer recurrence-free survival than those with a high index (p < 0.001).

Currently, no available drugs efficiently target AR-V7 in clinical practice. The DNA binding domain (DBD) is indispensable for the transcriptional activity of AR full length and AR splice variants, including AR-V7. Based on the homodimerization structure of the AR DBD, a novel peptide-based proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) drug is designed to induce AR and AR-V7 degradation in a DBD and MDM2-dependent manner, without showing any activity on other hormone receptors. To overcome the short half-life and poor cell penetrability of peptide PROTAC drugs, an ultrasmall gold (Au)-peptide complex platform to deliver the AR DBD PROTAC in vivo is developed. The obtained Au-AR pep-PROTAC effectively degrades AR and AR-V7 in prostate cancer cell lines, particularly in CWR22Rv1 cells with DC50 values 48.8 and 79.2 nM, respectively. Au-AR pep-PROTAC results in suppression of AR levels and induces tumor regression in both enzalutamide sensitive and resistant prostate cancer animal models.

Methods:   A total of 17,523 cancer patients with a broad range of solid tumors, who received eGT at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between July 2015 to April 2020, were included in the study. The patients were unselected for current GT criteria such as cancer type, age of onset, and/or family history of disease. The diagnostic yield of eGT was determined for each cancer type. For 9187 patients with five common cancer types frequently interrogated for hereditary predisposition (breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer), the rate of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants in genes that have been associated with each cancer type was analyzed. The clinical implications of additional findings in genes not known to be associated with a patients' cancer type were investigated.  Results:   16.7% of patients in a broad cancer cohort had P/LP variants in hereditary cancer predisposition genes identified by eGT. The diagnostic yield of eGT in patients with breast, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancer was 17.5%, 15.3%, 24.2%, 19.4%, and 15.9%, respectively. Additionally, 8% of the patients with five common cancers had P/LP variants in genes not known to be associated with the patient's current cancer type, with 0.8% of them having such a variant that confers a high risk for another cancer type. Analysis of clinical and family histories revealed that 74% of patients with variants in genes not associated with their current cancer type but which conferred a high risk for another cancer did not meet the current GT criteria for the genes harboring these variants. One or more variants of uncertain significance were identified in 57% of the patients.  Conclusions:   Compared to targeted testing approaches, eGT can increase the yield of detection of hereditary cancer predisposition in patients with a range of tumors, allowing opportunities for enhanced surveillance and intervention. The benefits of performing eGT should be weighed against the added number of VUSs identified with this approach.""","""['Ozge Ceyhan-Birsoy#', 'Gowtham Jayakumaran#', 'Yelena Kemel', 'Maksym Misyura', 'Umut Aypar', 'Sowmya Jairam', 'Ciyu Yang', 'Yirong Li', 'Nikita Mehta', 'Anna Maio', 'Angela Arnold', 'Erin Salo-Mullen', 'Margaret Sheehan', 'Aijazuddin Syed', 'Michael Walsh', 'Maria Carlo', 'Mark Robson', 'Kenneth Offit', 'Marc Ladanyi', 'Jorge S Reis-Filho', 'Zsofia K Stadler', 'Liying Zhang', 'Alicia Latham', 'Ahmet Zehir', 'Diana Mandelker']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Genome Med""","""['Analysis of hereditary cancer syndromes by using a panel of genes: novel and multiple pathogenic mutations.', 'Expanded Gene Panel Use for Women With Breast Cancer: Identification and Intervention Beyond Breast Cancer Risk.', 'Comparison of Universal Genetic Testing vs Guideline-Directed Targeted Testing for Patients With Hereditary Cancer Syndrome.', 'Germline testing for homologous recombination repair genes-opportunities and challenges.', 'Hereditary Predisposition to Prostate Cancer: From Genetics to Clinical Implications.', 'Diagnostic yield and clinical relevance of expanded germline genetic testing for nearly 7000 suspected HBOC patients.']"""

Interaction between tumor cells and bone cells can promote progression and influence tumor phenotype. It is known that prostate cancer cells support osteoclast differentiation, and degradation of bone matrix by osteoclasts releases growth factors stimulating tumor cell proliferation and invasion. In the present study osteolytic (PC-3) and osteoblastic (LNCaP-19) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells were co-cultured with mature osteoclasts or their precursor cells (RAW 264.7) to characterize direct effects of mature osteoclasts on CRPC cells. Osteoclasts increased proliferation and decrease apoptosis of CRPC cells as assessed with flow cytometry. RNA sequencing revealed that osteolytic CRPC cells were more responsive to osteoclast stimulation regarding gene expression, but the overall induced expression patterns were similar between the prostate cancer cell lines. Genes related to DNA repair were upregulated by osteoclasts, while genes related to endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and cholesterol synthesis were downregulated. The results of this study shows that osteoclasts directly influence CRPC cells, increasing proliferation, decreasing apoptosis, and affecting gene expression pathways that can affect sensitivity to DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum function. This suggests targeting of osteoclasts to be a possible way to affect efficacy of other drugs by combination regimens in treating prostate cancer metastases.""","""['Junchi Huang', 'Eva Freyhult', 'Robert Buckland', 'Andreas Josefsson', 'Jan-Erik Damber', 'Karin Welén']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Exp Metastasis""","""['The roles of RUNX2 and osteoclasts in regulating expression of steroidogenic enzymes in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Corosolic acid, a natural triterpenoid, induces ER stress-dependent apoptosis in human castration resistant prostate cancer cells via activation of IRE-1/JNK, PERK/CHOP and TRIB3.', 'Osteoblasts promote castration-resistant prostate cancer by altering intratumoral steroidogenesis.', 'Upregulation of Scavenger Receptor B1 Is Required for Steroidogenic and Nonsteroidogenic Cholesterol Metabolism in Prostate Cancer.', 'Osteoblasts stimulate the osteogenic and metastatic progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer in a novel model for in vitro and in vivo studies.', 'Research progress of bone metastases: From disease recognition to clinical practice.']"""

The objective of this study was to investigate long-term outcomes of patients with negative and equivocal mpMRIs and to develop a predictive score for csCaP risk stratification in this group.  Patients and methods:   Patients who underwent an upfront mpMRI between May 2015 and March 2018 with an MRI score Likert 1 to 3 were included in the study. Patients had either a CaP diagnosis at MRI-targeted biopsy or were not diagnosed and attended follow-up in the community. Outcomes were analysed through the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox Model. Regression coefficients of significant variables were used to develop a Risk of significant Cancer of the Prostate score (RosCaP).  Results:   At first assessment 281/469 patients had mpMRI only and 188/469 mpMRI and biopsy, 26 csCaP were found at biopsy, including 10/26 in Likert 3 patients. 12/371 patients discharged without CaP after first assessment were diagnosed with csCaP during a median of 34.2 months' follow-up, 11/12 diagnosis occurred in patients omitting initial biopsy. csCaP diagnosis-free survival was 95.7% in the MRI group and 99.1% in the biopsy group. From these outcomes, a continuous RosCaP score was developed: RosCaP = 0.083 x Age - 0.202 x (1/PSA Density) + 0.786 (if Likert 3), and 4 risk classes were proposed. Limitations include retrospective design and absence of external validation.

The role of NO in PDT-treated cancer cells has been investigated in several studies. They showed that low iNOS/NO levels stimulate signaling pathways that promote tumor survival, while high iNOS/NO levels arrest tumor growth. There is increasing evidence that ROS/RNS control both proliferation and migration of cells in the vicinity of PDT-treated tumor cells (so-called bystander cells). In this work, we addressed the question of how NO, which is generated by weak PDT, affects bystander cells. We used a conditioned medium: medium of PDT-treated tumor cells containing the stressors produced by the cells was added to untreated cells mimicking the neighboring bystander cells to investigate whether the conditioned medium affects cell proliferation.

Here we report the first attempt to quantify the membrane-to-lumen partition of proteins in EVs. A semi-quantitative model based on available well-established compositional and microstructural data is formulated. The model allows for the estimation of the overall protein content of an EV as well as of the partition between membrane (surface) associated and lumen (bulk) contained proteins as a function of the EV size and shape. It further identifies 180 nm as a switch diameter, below which EVs result composed of more membrane than luminal proteins. At larger diameters the partition is reversed, reaching predominance of luminal proteins (> 80 %) in large EVs (diameter > 800 nm). The model is successfully tested to analyze and describe a real preparation composed of subpopulations of small EVs (diameter < 200 nm), including exosomes and ectosomes, and large EVs including large oncosomes (diameter > 1000 nm) from human prostate cancer cells.

Surgery plays a pivotal role in cancer care; however, it is unclear whether and how racial/ethnic disparities in cancer surgery have changed over time.  Methods:   This cohort study included 1,113,256 White and Black cancer patients across 9 years (2007-2015) using patient data extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-18 registries. Patient data were included from 2007 to adjust insurance status and by 2015 to obtain at least a 3-year survival follow-up (until 2018). The primary outcome was a surgical intervention. The secondary outcomes were the use of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Adjusted associations of the race (Black/White) with the outcomes were measured in each cancer type and year.  Results:   The gap between surgery rates for Black and White patients narrowed overall, from an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.621 (0.592-0.652) in 2007 to 0.734 (0.702-0.768) in 2015. However, the racial gap persisted in the surgery rates for lung, breast, prostate, esophageal, and ovarian cancers. In surgically treated patients with lymph node metastasis, Black patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) were less likely to receive (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy than White patients. Black patients undergoing surgery were more likely to have a worse CSS rate than White patients undergoing surgery. In breast cancer patients, the overall trend was narrow, but continuously present, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 1.224 (1.278-1.173) in 2007 and 1.042 (1.132-0.96) in 2015.  Conclusions:   Overall, progress has been made toward narrowing the Black-White gap in cancer surgical opportunity and survival. Future efforts should be directed toward those specific cancers for which the Black-White gap continues.

Significant increases in both PDGF and SPC25 levels were detected in PrC specimens compared to paired adjacent normal prostate tissues. A significant correlation was detected between PDGF and SPC25 levels in PrC specimens and cell lines. SPC25 increased PDGF production and tumor cell growth in cultured PrC cells and in xenotransplantation. Mechanistically, SPC25 appeared to activate PDGF in PrC likely through Early Growth Response 1 (Egr1), while the secreted PDGF signaled to TAM through PDGFR on macrophages and polarized macrophages, which, in turn, induced the growth of PrC cells likely through their production and secretion of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1).

Further studies showed that the phosphorylation levels of RIPK1, RIPK, and MLKL were increased in a concentration-dependent manner. In in vivo model, IDOAMP reduced the tumor volumes and weights. In conclusion, IDOAMP directly inhibited Aurora kinase A and promoted the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL necrosome activation to inhibit the prostate cancer.""","""['Hong Xu', 'Xingkai Zeng', 'Xuecheng Wei', 'Zhongfeng Xue', 'Naiwen Chen', 'Wei Zhu', 'Wenhua Xie', 'Yi He']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oxid Med Cell Longev""","""['The neurotoxicant PCB-95 by increasing the neuronal transcriptional repressor REST down-regulates caspase-8 and increases Ripk1, Ripk3 and MLKL expression determining necroptotic neuronal death.', 'Inhibition of Aurora Kinase A Induces Necroptosis in\xa0Pancreatic\xa0Carcinoma.', 'CAMK2/CaMKII activates MLKL in short-term starvation to facilitate autophagic flux.', 'Necroptosis: a crucial pathogenic mediator of human disease.', 'The diverse role of RIP kinases in necroptosis and inflammation.', 'Synthesis and anti-proliferative activity of dehydroabietinol derivatives bearing a triazole moiety.']"""

Also, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) against Hsp27 (OGX-427 or apatorsen) has been assessed in different clinical trials. Here, we illustrate that Hsp27 highly regulates the expression of the human DEAD-box protein 5 (DDX5), and we define DDX5 as a novel therapeutic target for CRPC treatment. DDX5 overexpression is strongly correlated with aggressive tumor features, notably with CRPC. DDX5 downregulation using a specific ASO-based inhibitor that acts on DDX5 mRNAs inhibits cell proliferation in preclinical models, and it particularly restores the treatment sensitivity of CRPC. Interestingly, through the identification and analysis of DDX5 protein interaction networks, we have identified some specific functions of DDX5 in CRPC that could contribute actively to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. We first present the interactions of DDX5 and the Ku70/80 heterodimer and the transcription factor IIH, thereby uncovering DDX5 roles in different DNA repair pathways. Collectively, our study highlights critical functions of DDX5 contributing to CRPC progression and provides preclinical proof of concept that a combination of ASO-directed DDX5 inhibition with a DNA damage-inducing therapy can serve as a highly potential novel strategy to treat CRPC.""","""['Thi Khanh Le', 'Chaïma Cherif', 'Kenneth Omabe', 'Clément Paris', 'François Lannes', 'Stéphane Audebert', 'Emilie Baudelet', 'Mourad Hamimed', 'Dominique Barbolosi', 'Pascal Finetti', 'Cyrille Bastide', 'Ladan Fazli', 'Martin Gleave', 'François Bertucci', 'David Taïeb', 'Palma Rocchi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Ther""","""['A phase I dose-escalation study of apatorsen (OGX-427), an antisense inhibitor targeting heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27), in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and other advanced cancers.', 'Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting TCTP as a new therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'TCTP Has a Crucial Role in the Different Stages of Prostate Cancer Malignant Progression.', 'Antisense oligonucleotide: A promising therapeutic option to beat COVID-19.', 'ZNF703 mRNA-Targeting Antisense Oligonucleotide Blocks Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.', 'Regulation of CD8 T Cell Differentiation by the RNA-Binding Protein DDX5.', ""Molecular Chaperones' Potential against Defective Proteostasis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis."", 'Pan-cancer analysis of the prognostic and immunological roles of DEAD-box helicase 5 (DDX5) in human tumors.']"""

The latter is also expressed in most prostate tumor epithelium. To engage a broader spectrum of cancers for imaging and therapy, we conjugated small-molecule FAP and PSMA-targeting moieties using an optimized linker to provide 64Cu-labeled compounds.  Methods:   We synthesized FP-L1 and FP-L2 using two linker constructs attaching the FAP and PSMA-binding pharmacophores. We determined in vitro inhibition constants (Ki) for FAP and PSMA. Cell uptake assays and flow cytometry were conducted in human glioma (U87), melanoma (SK-MEL-24), prostate cancer (PSMA + PC3 PIP and PSMA - PC3 flu), and clear cell renal cell carcinoma lines (PSMA + /PSMA - 786-O). Quantitative positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and tissue biodistribution studies were performed using U87, SK-MEL-24, PSMA + PC3 PIP, and PSMA + 786-O experimental xenograft models and the KPC genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer.  Results: 64Cu-FP-L1 and 64Cu-FP-L2 were produced in high radiochemical yields (> 98%) and molar activities (> 19 MBq/nmol). Ki values were in the nanomolar range for both FAP and PSMA. PET imaging and biodistribution studies revealed high and specific targeting of 64Cu-FP-L1 and 64Cu-FP-L2 for FAP and PSMA. 64Cu-FP-L1 displayed more favorable pharmacokinetics than 64Cu-FP-L2. In the U87 tumor model at 2 h post-injection, tumor uptake of 64Cu-FP-L1 (10.83 ± 1.02%ID/g) was comparable to 64Cu-FAPI-04 (9.53 ± 2.55%ID/g). 64Cu-FP-L1 demonstrated high retention 5.34 ± 0.29%ID/g at 48 h in U87 tumor. Additionally, 64Cu-FP-L1 showed high retention in PSMA + PC3 PIP tumor (12.06 ± 0.78%ID/g at 2 h and 10.51 ± 1.82%ID/g at 24 h).  Conclusions: 64Cu-FP-L1 demonstrated high and specific tumor targeting of FAP and PSMA.

It has been shown that somatic deleterious mutations in ERCC2, gain-of-function mutations in ERBB2, and alterations in ATM, RB1, and FANCC are correlated with pathological response to NAC in MIBC. The objective of this study was to validate these genomic biomarkers in pretreatment transurethral resection material from an independent retrospective cohort of 165 patients with MIBC who subsequently underwent NAC and radical surgery. Patients with ypT0/Tis/Ta/T1N0 disease after surgery were defined as responders. Somatic deleterious mutations in ERCC2 were found in nine of 68 (13%) evaluable responders and two of 95 (2%) evaluable nonresponders (p = 0.009; FDR = 0.03). No correlation was observed between response and alterations in ERBB2 or in ATM, RB1, or FANCC alone or in combination. In an exploratory analysis, no additional genomic alterations discriminated between responders and nonresponders to NAC. No further associations were identified between the aforementioned biomarkers and pathological complete response (ypT0N0) after surgery. In conclusion, we observed a positive association between deleterious mutations in ERCC2 and pathological response to NAC, but not overall survival or recurrence-free survival. Other previously reported genomic biomarkers were not validated. PATIENT SUMMARY: It is currently unknown which patients will respond to chemotherapy before definitive surgery for bladder cancer.

Currently, diverse microfluidic platforms have been developed for isolating CTCs from blood, but it remains a challenge to develop a low-cost, practical, and efficient strategy.  Objectives:   This study aimed to isolate CTCs from the blood of cancer patients via introducing a new and efficient micropillar array-based microfluidic chip (MPA-Chip), as well as providing prognostic information and monitoring the treatment efficacy in cancer patients.  Methods:   We fabricated a microfluidic chip (MPA-Chip) containing arrays of micropillars with different geometries (lozenge, rectangle, circle, and triangle). We conducted numerical simulations to compare velocity and pressure profiles inside the micropillar arrays. Also, we experimentally evaluated the capture efficiency and purity of the geometries using breast and prostate cancer cell lines as well as a blood sample. Moreover, the device's performance was validated on 12 patients with breast cancer (BC) in different states.  Results:   The lozenge geometry was selected as the most effective and optimized micropillar design for CTCs isolation, providing high capture efficiency (>85 %), purity (>90 %), and viability (97 %). Furthermore, the lozenge MPA-chip was successfully validated by the detection of CTCs from 12 breast cancer (BC) patients, with non-metastatic (median number of 6 CTCs) and metastatic (median number of 25 CTCs) diseases, showing different prognoses. Also, increasing the chemotherapy period resulted in a decrease in the number of captured CTCs from 23 to 7 for the metastatic patient. The MPA-Chip size was only 0.25 cm2 and the throughput of a single chip was 0.5 ml/h, which can be increased by multiple MPA-Chips in parallel.  Conclusion:   The lozenge MPA-Chip presented a novel micropillar geometry for on-chip CTC isolation, detection, and staining, and in the future, the possibilities can be extended to the culture of the CTCs.""","""['Mehdi Rahmanian', 'Omid Sartipzadeh Hematabad', 'Esfandyar Askari', 'Farhad Shokati', 'Atin Bakhshi', 'Shiva Moghadam', 'Asiie Olfatbakhsh', 'Esmat Al Sadat Hashemi', 'Mohammad Khorsand Ahmadi', 'Seyed Morteza Naghib', 'Nidhi Sinha', 'Jurjen Tel', 'Hossein Eslami Amirabadi', 'Jaap M J den Toonder', 'Keivan Majidzadeh-A']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Adv Res""","""['Nanoroughened adhesion-based capture of circulating tumor cells with heterogeneous expression and metastatic characteristics.', 'Wedge-shaped microfluidic chip for circulating tumor cells isolation and its clinical significance in gastric cancer.', 'Recent advances in isolation and detection of circulating tumor cells with a microfluidic system.', 'Isolation and molecular analysis of circulating tumor cells from lung cancer patients using a microfluidic chip type cell sorter.', ""Recent Advances in Microfluidic Platforms Applied in Cancer Metastasis: Circulating Tumor Cells' (CTCs) Isolation and Tumor-On-A-Chip."", 'Combined Femtosecond Laser Glass Microprocessing for Liver-on-Chip Device Fabrication.', 'Recent Trends of Microfluidics in Food Science and Technology: Fabrications and Applications.']"""

The study of tissue markers of PCa can provide information about the state of proliferation and apoptosis in tumors, the susceptibility of tumor cells to metastasis and the mechanisms of resistance to therapy, which, in turn, can help predict the course of the disease and develop personalized treatment. Polyamines (PAs) spermine, spermidine, putrescine are of particular interest in terms of PCa tissue markers.  Aim:   To investigate the levels of basic and acetylated forms of PAs in the postoperative samples of malignant and benign tumors of the human prostate and evaluate the possibility of their use for differential diagnosis and assessment of the PCa aggressiveness.  Object and methods:   57 postoperative tumor samples from patients with prostate adenocarcinoma of different Gleason score (GS) and clinical stage (T1-T4) and 20 samples of tumors from patients with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) were studied. The content of PAs was determined by high performance liquid chromatography.  Results:   Among the studied PAs, the most significant difference between PCa and BPH was observed for spermine (Spm). The level of Spm in PCa samples was 16 times lower than in BPH samples (p < 0.01). We did not find a significant dependence of PAs levels, including Spm, on the clinical stage. The association between the Spm level and the GS was established. The indolent (GS6) tumors were characterized by the highest Spm level while in the most aggressive (GS9 and GS10) tumors Spm content was the lowest.  Conclusions:   A sharp decrease in Spm levels is probably a characteristic feature of prostate malignant tumors. The obtained results indicate an association of Spm levels in tumors with the GS. This may indicate Spm involvement in the formation of the aggressiveness of PCa. The results of the study can be further used for differential diagnosis of prostate tumors and for assessing the aggressiveness of PCa.""","""['S P Zaletok', 'O O Klenov', 'V V Bentrad', 'M P Prylutskyi', 'Yu V Vitruk', 'E O Stakhovsky', 'A V Timoshenko']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Exp Oncol""","""['Urinary Polyamines: A Pilot Study on Their Roles as Prostate Cancer Detection Biomarkers.', 'Use of two gene panels for prostate cancer diagnosis and patient risk stratification.', 'Using Genetic and Epigenetic Markers to Improve Differential Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer and Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia by Noninvasive Methods in Mexican Patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The Emerging Clinical Role of Spermine in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Aim:   To study the level of antibodies against prokaryotic homolog of human Hsp60 (GroEL) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients as an additional risk marker for the prediction of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Patients and methods:   A total of 55 patients with localized and locally advanced PCa, who had undergone RP between July 2013 and May 2014 were enrolled. Level of antibodies to GroEL and human Hsp60 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay before surgery. Serum samples of blood donors with low reactivity to GroEL and human Hsp60 were used as controls. The relationship between IgG antibodies against bacterial Hsp60 and human Hsp60 and clinicopathological features were analyzed. The biochemical recurrence (BCR) free survival rate was estimated by the Kaplan - Meier method. The univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the risk factors of BCR-free survival rate.  Results:   There were significant differences in anti-GroEL IgG levels between control and PCa patients while no significant differences in anti-human Hsp60 IgG levels between control and PCa patients were detected. During the follow-up period, 40/55 (72.7%) patients developed BCR. The time from surgery to BCR was from 18 to 72 months. Elevated IgG antibodies against bacterial Hsp60 in patients who had undergone RP were associated with early occurrence of biochemical relapse and lower 5-year BCR-free survival rate respectively (p < 0.001). The multivariate analysis indicated that IgG to GroEL (hazard ratio = 2.465; 95% confidence interval: 1.311-4.634, p < 0.05) could be independent prognostic factor in the patients who had developed BCR.

Recent phase III data support even greater survival impact of a triplet regimen with ADT plus docetaxel plus an ARSi (abiraterone or darolutamide) compared to ADT plus docetaxel.  Objective:   To evaluate whether the addition of an ARSi to ADT improves outcomes of mCSPC patients treated with docetaxel.  Methods:   We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and ASCO Meeting abstracts for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) testing the combination of ARSi + ADT in mCSPC men who received docetaxel. Data extraction was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. Summary hazard ratio (HR) was calculated using random- or fixed-effects models. The statistical analyses were performed with RevMan software (v.5.2.3).  Results:   Five RCTs were selected. Triplet therapy improved overall survival (OS) compared to ADT + docetaxel in mCSPC patients (HR = 0.73; p &lt; 0.00001). This intensified strategy maintained the OS benefit when the ARSi was administered concomitant to chemotherapy (HR = 0.72; p &lt; 0.00001), but no statistical effect was detected if the ARSi was sequential to docetaxel (p = 0.44). Moreover, in the subgroup of men with de novo mCSPC, triplets significantly improved OS (HR = 0.72, p &lt; 0.0001). The lack of access to raw data was the main limit of our analysis.

NRP2 silencing restricted NEPC tumor xenograft growth. Mechanistically, NRP2 engages in reciprocal crosstalk with AR, where NRP2 is transcriptionally inhibited by AR, and in turn suppresses AR signaling by downregulating the AR transcriptional program and confers resistance to enzalutamide. Moreover, NRP2 physically interacts with VEGFR2 through the intracellular SEA domain to activate STAT3 phosphorylation and subsequently SOX2, thus driving NEPC differentiation and growth.

Although there are several commercial Monte Carlo treatment planning systems (TPSs), some clinics may not have access to these resources. We present a method for routine, independent patient dose calculations from treatment plans generated in a commercial TPS with our own Monte Carlo model using free, open-source software.  Materials and methods:   A model of the Elekta Versa HD linear accelerator was developed using the EGSnrc codes. A MATLAB script was created to take clinical patient plans and convert the DICOM RTP files into a format usable by EGSnrc. Ten patients' treatment plans were exported from the Monaco TPS to be recalculated using EGSnrc. Treatment simulations were done in BEAMnrc, and doses were calculated using Source 21 in DOSXYZnrc. Results were compared to patient plans calculated in the Monaco TPS and evaluated in Verisoft with a gamma criterion of 3%/2 mm.  Results:   Our Monte Carlo model was validated within 1%/1-mm accuracy of measured percent depth doses and profiles. Gamma passing rates ranged from 82.1% to 99.8%, with 7 out of 10 plans having a gamma pass rate over 95%. Lung and prostate patients showed the best agreement with doses calculated in Monaco. All statistical uncertainties in DOSXYZnrc were less than 3.0%.  Conclusion:   A Monte Carlo model for routine patient dose calculation was successfully developed and tested. This model allows users to directly recalculate DICOM RP files containing patients' plans that have been exported from a commercial TPS.""","""['Holly M Parenica Paschal', 'Christopher N Kabat', 'Pavlos Papaconstadopoulos', 'Neil A Kirby', 'Pamela A Myers', 'Timothy D Wagner', 'Sotirios Stathakis']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Study of out-of-field dose in photon radiotherapy: A commercial treatment planning system versus measurements and Monte Carlo simulations.', 'Monte Carlo photon beam modeling and commissioning for radiotherapy dose calculation algorithm.', 'The commissioning and validation of Monaco treatment planning system on an Elekta VersaHD linear accelerator.', 'Monte Carlo and analytic modeling of an Elekta Infinity linac with Agility MLC: Investigating the significance of accurate model parameters for small radiation fields.', 'Reflections on a life with Monte Carlo in Medical Physics.']"""

We aimed to investigate the effect of NRF1 overexpression on the metastasis potential of PC3 prostate cancer cells and the associated molecular mechanisms.  Materials and methods:   Cell survival, migration capacity, mitochondrial biogenesis, the expression of TGF-β signaling and EMT markers were examined after overexpression and silencing of NRF1 in PC3 cells.  Results:   We found that NRF1-overexpressing cells exhibited a decreased cell viability and proliferation ability as well as a reduced migration capacity compared to control cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of NRF1 increased the mitochondrial biogenesis and inhibited the EMT characteristics, including a decrease in the mesenchymal marker, α-SMA and an increase in the epithelial cell marker, E-cadherin. We also demonstrated that overexpression of NRF1 suppressed the expression of TGF-β signaling in PC3 cells. As expected, silencing of NRF1 reversed the abovementioned effects.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated that upregulation of NRF1 holds the potential to inhibit the metastasis of prostate cancer, possibly through an elevation of mitochondrial biogenesis and the subsequent repression of TGF-β-associated EMT.

Normal tissue toxicity responses to fraction size alteration are nonlinear: the linear-quadratic model is a widely used framework accounting for this, through the α/β ratio. Few α/β ratio estimates exist for human late genitourinary endpoints; here we provide estimates derived from a hypofractionation trial.  Methods and materials:   The CHHiP trial randomized 3216 men with localized prostate cancer 1:1:1 between conventionally fractionated intensity modulated RT (74 Gy/37 fractions (Fr)) and 2 moderately hypofractionated regimens (60 Gy/20 Fr and 57 Gy/19 Fr). RT plan and suitable follow-up assessment was available for 2206 men. Three prospectively assessed clinician-reported toxicity scales were amalgamated for common genitourinary endpoints: dysuria, hematuria, incontinence, reduced flow/stricture, and urine frequency. Per endpoint, only patients with baseline zero toxicity were included. Three models for endpoint grade ≥1 (G1+) and G2+ toxicity were fitted: Lyman Kutcher-Burman (LKB) without equivalent dose in 2 Gy/Fr (EQD2) correction [LKB-NoEQD2]; LKB with EQD2-correction [LKB-EQD2]; LKB-EQD2 with dose-modifying-factor (DMF) inclusion [LKB-EQD2-DMF]. DMFs were age, diabetes, hypertension, pelvic surgery, prior transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), overall treatment time and acute genitourinary toxicity (G2+). Bootstrapping generated 95% confidence intervals and unbiased performance estimates. Models were compared by likelihood ratio test.  Results:   The LKB-EQD2 model significantly improved performance over LKB-NoEQD2 for just 3 endpoints: dysuria G1+ (α/β = 2.0 Gy; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-3.2 Gy), hematuria G1+ (α/β = 0.9 Gy; 95% CI, 0.1-2.2 Gy) and hematuria G2+ (α/β = 0.6 Gy; 95% CI, 0.1-1.7 Gy). For these 3 endpoints, further incorporation of 2 DMFs improved on LKB-EQD2: acute genitourinary toxicity and prior TURP (hematuria G1+ only), but α/β ratio estimates remained stable.  Conclusions:   Inclusion of EQD2-correction significantly improved model fitting for dysuria and hematuria endpoints, where fitted α/β ratio estimates were low: 0.6 to 2 Gy.

We evaluated real-world management of patients treated with these agents at a single center.  Patients and methods:   Patients with de novo mHSPC treated with upfront docetaxel or an NHA between January 2014 and April 2019 at Mount Sinai Health System were included. We evaluated time to next treatment (TTNT), PSA progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after initial treatment with these drugs. Kaplan Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used for analysis. We additionally assessed the prognostic value of post-treatment PSA.  Results:   We identified 94 de novo mHSPC patients; 52 and 42 treated with upfront docetaxel and NHAs, respectively. NHAs were associated with a median TTNT of 20.7 months compared to 10.1 months with docetaxel (log-rank p = 0.023).

Among docetaxel treated patients, TTNT was shorter among those with high metastasis burden (9.63 vs 25.5 months, p = 0.026) which was not observed among NHA treated patients (25.1 vs 20.7 months, p = 0.79). Regardless of treatment, lower post-treatment PSA levels were associated with improved TTNT (58.95 vs. 11.57 vs. 9.4 months for PSA ≤0.2, 0.2-0.4, >0.4ng/ml, respectively; p<0.001).  Conclusion:   Real world data demonstrated a shorter duration of treatment with docetaxel than NHAs, reflecting the time-limited nature of docetaxel regimens compared to the treat-till-progression approach of NHAs.

Federated learning (FL) alleviates the constraint by allowing different institutions to collaboratively train a federated model without sharing data. However, the federated model is often suboptimal with respect to the characteristics of each client's local data. Instead of training a single global model, we propose Customized FL (CusFL), for which each client iteratively trains a client-specific/private model based on a federated global model aggregated from all private models trained in the immediate previous iteration. Two overarching strategies employed by CusFL lead to its superior performance: 1) the federated model is mainly for feature alignment and thus only consists of feature extraction layers; 2) the federated feature extractor is used to guide the training of each private model. In that way, CusFL allows each client to selectively learn useful knowledge from the federated model to improve its personalized model.

Methods:   Patients who underwent 68 Ga-PSMA11-PET prior to sRT were enrolled in four high-volume centers in this retrospective multicenter study. Only patients with PET-positive local recurrence (LR) and/or nodal recurrence (NR) within the pelvis were included. Patients were treated with intensity-modulated-sRT to the prostatic fossa and elective lymphatics in case of nodal disease. Dose escalation was delivered to PET-positive LR and NR. Androgen deprivation therapy was administered at the discretion of the treating physician. LR and NR were manually delineated and SUVmax was extracted for LR and NR. Cox-regression was performed to analyze the impact of clinical parameters and the SUVmax-derived values on BRFS.  Results:   Two hundred thirty-five patients with a median follow-up (FU) of 24 months were included in the final cohort. Two-year and 4-year BRFS for all patients were 68% and 56%. The presence of LR was associated with favorable BRFS (p = 0.016). Presence of NR was associated with unfavorable BRFS (p = 0.007). While there was a trend for SUVmax values ≥ median (p = 0.071), SUVmax values ≥ 75% quartile in LR were significantly associated with unfavorable BRFS (p = 0.022, HR: 2.1, 95%CI 1.1-4.6). SUVmax value in NR was not significantly associated with BRFS. SUVmax in LR stayed significant in multivariate analysis (p = 0.030). Sensitivity analysis with patients for who had a FU of > 12 months (n = 197) confirmed these results.  Conclusion:   The non-invasive biomarker SUVmax can prognosticate outcome in patients undergoing sRT and recurrence confined to the prostatic fossa in PSMA-PET. Its addition might contribute to improve risk stratification of patients with recurrent PCa and to guide personalized treatment decisions in terms of treatment intensification or de-intensification.

The purpose of cancer screening is to detect the disease at an early stage to help effective treatment. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of MRI and PI-RADS in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and examine the relation between screening parameters with prostate cancer.  Methods:   The PACS system was analyzed and MRI images between September 2016 and April 2018 were listed. The state of patients regarding having pathology results were obtained. PSA values were listed. The prostate volume and the prostate density was calculated. PI-RADS assessment was used for each prostate lesion.  Results:   Data of 138 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 63±8.9. The mean prostate gland volume was 63.8±39.3ml, the mean PSA value was 12.51±25.22 and the mean PSA density was calculated as 0.319±0.945. A statistically significant difference was found between age and prostate volume and cancer. The age of the cancer cases was higher than those who did not have cancer (p<0.05). A negative correlation was found between prostate volume and cancer status. The prostate volume of non-cancer cases was higher compared to cancer cases (p=0.0001). 55 patients had no malignancy. It was observed that 56.4% of cancer patients had significant cancer. The frequency of using PI-RADS scores was 4% for P1, 36% for P2, 14% for P3, 28% for P4, and 18% for P5. Clinically significant cancer was present in 57.9% of patients with PI-RADS score4 and 69.6% of patients with PI-RADS score5. It was found that diagnostic values were significantly high for prostate cancer screening in patients with PI-RADS scores4 and 5 (Sensitivity 76.4%, Specificity 73.5%, Negative predictive value 82.4%, Positive predictive value 65.6%).  Conclusion:   PI-RADS and MRI can be useful for the diagnosis of the clinically significant prostate cancer in patients at risk for prostate cancer. It is a non-invasive, repeatable method for prostate cancer screening and diagnosis. In prostate screening PSA reliability may be questioned. Additional methods are needed for the diagnosis.

Patients and methods:   Data were obtained from 247 patients with PI-RADS 3 lesions on mpMRI and who had received a software guided transperineal/transrectal MRI/transrectal ultrasonography (MRI/TRUS) fusion prostate biopsy with concomitant standard systematic 12-core biopsy following mpMRI in the prostate cancer and prostate biopsy database of Turkish Urooncology Association, between 2016 and 2020. The cut-off values of clinical parameters were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the clinical parameters in predicting csPC.  Results:   A total of 56 patients (22.6%) had prostate cancer, 23 (9.3%) of whom had csPC.

Results:   A total of 98 patients underwent RP with a mean age of 65.5 years (50-83) and a mean follow-up time of 31.2 months (6-52). Seventy and 28 patients were evaluated in the group without IDC-P and group with IDC-P, respectively.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) and epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted peptide (GE11) dual ligands were applied to modify the nano-systems.  Methods:   In this study, GE11-modified nanoparticles (GE-NPs) were applied for the loading of DTX, and HA-decorated NPs (HA-NPs) were used to encapsulate FMN. HA and GE11 dual ligand-modified binary nanoparticles (HAGE-DTX/FMN-NPs) were constructed by the self-assembling of GE-NPs and HA-NPs. The anti-PCa ability of the system was evaluated in vitro on PC-3 human prostate carcinoma cells (PC3 cells) and in vivo on PC3 tumor-bearing mice in comparison with single NPs and free drugs formulations.  Results:   HA/GE-DTX/FMN-NPs were nano-sized particles with smaller particles coating on the inner core and achieved a size of 189.5 nm. HA/GE-DTX/FMN-NPs showed a cellular uptake efficiency of 59.6%, and a more efficient inhibition effect on PC3 cells compared with single ligand-modified NPs and free drugs.

However, the clinical relevance and prognostic value of the cGAS-STING pathway in human cancers remains largely unexplored.  Methods:   A gene signature related to the cGAS-STING score was identified. The pan-cancer landscape of cGAS-STING expression was calculated using the RNAseq data acquired from the TCGA cohort. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) were determined by the ssGSEA method. Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression analyses, and the area under the curve (AUC) were employed to decipher the predictive value of cGAS-STING risk score and TIICs across several human cancers.  Results:   Most tumor tissues displayed a higher cGAS-STING score compared with their corresponding nontumor tissues, except for prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) and uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Higher cGAS-STING score was closely associated with poor clinical outcome of kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), whereas the cGAS-STING score predicted a better prognosis in pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma (PCPG). Enrichment analysis showed that cGAS-STING was profoundly implicated in diverse immune-related pathways in KIRC, KIRP, and PCPG. Significant positive correlations were noticed between cGAS-STING score and TIICs, including activated CD8+ T cells, activated CD4+ T cells, monocytes, and mast cells. Finally, the cGAS-STING score was revealed to be an independent prognostic factor for KIRC patients and possessed a strong predictive power for the prognostic evaluation of KIRC and KIRP patients.  Conclusions:   We constructed a cGAS-STING gene signature to predict survival and tumor immunity across human cancers, which can serve as a novel prognostic indicator and therapeutic target, especially in KIRC and KIRP.""","""['Zheng Wu', 'Ying Lin', 'Li-Min Liu', 'Yan-Li Hou', 'Wei-Ting Qin', 'Lei Zhang', 'Shu-Heng Jiang', 'Qin Yang', 'Yong-Rui Bai']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol Res""","""['Identification and validation of the prognostic value of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon (cGAS-STING) related genes in gastric cancer.', 'Identification of prognostic biomarkers and correlations with immune infiltrates among cGAS-STING in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'The cGAS-STING Pathway: Novel Perspectives in Liver Diseases.', 'The cGAS-STING pathway-related gene signature can predict patient prognosis and immunotherapy responses in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate-Adenosine Monophosphate Synthase (cGAS), a Multifaceted Platform of Intracellular DNA Sensing.', 'Inflammatory Networks in Renal Cell Carcinoma.']"""

We aimed to derive a prostatectomy specific index (PSI) for patients undergoing RP and compare its performance to universally used indices.  Methods:   The cohort was derived from National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database between 2005 and 2012. The primary outcome was incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events at 30 days post-surgery including: death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed, performance and calibration were evaluated using a ROC analysis and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, the PSI index was derived and compared to the RCRI and AUB-HAS2 indices.  Results:   A total of 17,299 patients were included in our cohort, with a mean age of 62 ± 7.4 years. Seventy three patients had a cardiac event post RP. The final PSI index encompassed six variables: history of heart disease, age, anemia, American society of anesthesiology class, surgical approach, and hypertension. The PSI ROC analysis provided C-statistic = 0.72, calibration R2 = 0.99 and proper goodness of fit. In comparison, the C-statistics of RCRI and AUB-HAS2 were found to be 0.57 and 0.65, respectively (p value < 0.001).

Herein, we report an under-appreciated role of STUB1 to dampen the interferon gamma (IFNγ) response. Genetic deletion of STUB1 increased IFNGR1 abundance on the cell surface and thus enhanced the downstream IFNγ response as showed by multiple approaches including Western blotting, flow cytometry, qPCR, phospho-STAT1 assay, immunopeptidomics, proteomics, and gene expression profiling. Human prostate and breast cancer cells with STUB1 deletion were also susceptible to cytokine-induced growth inhibition. Furthermore, blockade of STUB1 protein function recapitulated the STUB1-null phenotypes. Despite these encouraging in vitro data and positive implications from clinical datasets, we did not observe in vivo benefits of inactivating Stub1 in mouse syngeneic tumour models-with or without combination with anti-PD-1 therapy.

Objective:   To establish the incidence and prognostic value of KLK4::KLKP1 fusion in a cohort of Middle Eastern men with PCa and explore the relationship of this marker to other relevant biomarkers (PTEN, ERG, SPINK1).  Design, setting, and participants:   We interrogated a cohort of 340 Middle Eastern men with localized PCa treated by radical prostatectomy between 2005 and 2015. KLK4::KLKP1 fusion status was assessed by RNA Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) and correlated to pathological and clinical parameters.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   RNA-CISH expression of KLK4::KLKP1 was correlated with prognostic factors, ERG, PTEN, and SPINK1 expression, and biochemical recurrence (BCR) following prostatectomy.  Results and limitations:   51.7% of patient samples showed positive KLK4::KLKP1 expression; more commonly in cores of PCa (38%) versus non-cancer (20.6%) (p < 0.0001) and in lower Gleason Grade Group tumors (1-3) vs (4-5). KLK4::KLKP1 expression positively correlated with ERG positivity and inversely associated with PTEN loss. No significant association was found with SPINK1 expression, seminal vesicle invasion, positive surgical margin, pathological stage, or patient age (< 50 or ≥ 50). The association between PTEN loss and BCR increased when combined with KLK4::KLKP1 negativity (HR 2.31, CI 1.03-5.20, p = 0.042).  Conclusions:   KLK4::KLKP1 expression is more common in this cohort of Middle Eastern men than has been reported in North American men.

The objective of this study was to perform a population-level analysis to assess the association between FSH levels and PC diagnosis.  Methods:   All men (n = 386,018) who had a pre-PC diagnosis FSH level and complete data were identified within the Veterans Affairs Health System between 1999 and 2018. The association between FSH level and time from FSH test to PC diagnosis was tested using stratified Cox proportional hazards models. Multivariable models were adjusted for age, year, race, body mass index, and Charlson comorbidity index. Due to nonproportional hazards over time, time to PC was modeled separately: ≤4 years after an FSH test and >4 years following an FSH test.  Results:   Median age at first FSH level was 64 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 54-72), median year of FSH was 2010 (IQR: 2005-2014), and 70% of the cohort was white. Median follow-up was 76 months (IQR: 38-126) during which 17,519 men (4.5%) were diagnosed with PC. On multivariable analysis, in the first 4 years after FSH test, there was no association between FSH and time to PC diagnosis. Starting from 4 years after FSH test, on multivariable analysis, a higher FSH level was associated with lower risk of PC with continuous modeling, but found no association with log continuous and categorical modeling.  Conclusions:   In this population-level study among male veterans receiving an FSH test for an unknown clinical indication, associations between FSH levels and PC risk were inconsistent and likely driven by selection bias and confounding variables.

The acute response of cancer cells to ADT includes apoptosis and cell death, but a large fraction remains arrested but viable. In this study, we focused on intensively characterizing the early metabolic changes that result after ADT to define potential metabolic targets for treatment.  Methods:   A combination of mass spectrometry, optical metabolic imaging which noninvasively measures drug responses in cells, oxygen consumption rate, and protein expression analysis was used to characterize and block metabolic pathways over several days in multiple PC cell lines with variable hormone response status including ADT sensitive lines LNCaP and VCaP, and resistant C4-2 and DU145.  Results:   Mass spectrometry analysis of LNCaP pre- and postexposure to ADT revealed an abundance of glycolytic intermediates after ADT. In LNCaP and VCaP, a reduction in the optical redox ratio [NAD(P)H/FAD], extracellular acidification rate, and a downregulation of key regulatory enzymes for fatty acid and glutamine utilization was acutely observed after ADT. Screening several metabolic inhibitors revealed that blocking fatty acid oxidation and synthesis reversed this stress response in the optical redox ratio seen with ADT alone in LNCaP and VCaP. In contrast, both cell lines demonstrated increased sensitivity to the glycolytic inhibitor 2-Deoxy- d-glucose(2-DG) and maintained sensitivity to electron transport chain inhibitor Malonate after ADT exposure. ADT followed by 2-DG results in synergistic cell death, a result not seen with simultaneous administration.  Conclusions:   Hormone-sensitive PC cells displayed altered metabolic profiles early after ADT including an overall depression in energy metabolism, induction of a quiescent/senescent phenotype, and sensitivity to selected metabolic inhibitors. Glycolytic blocking agents (e.g., 2-DG) as a sequential treatment after ADT may be promising.""","""['Mikolaj J Filon', 'Amani A Gillette', 'Bing Yang', 'Tariq A Khemees', 'Melissa C Skala', 'David F Jarrard']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['CACNA1D overexpression and voltage-gated calcium channels in prostate cancer during androgen deprivation.', 'Pharmacological inhibition of the Notch pathway enhances the efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Intermittent androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Accumulating evidence has proven the safety and feasibility of radical prostatectomy and local or metastasis-directed radiotherapy for oligometastatic patients. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the safety and feasibility outcomes of metastasis-directed neoadjuvant radiotherapy (naRT) and neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (naADT) followed by robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for treating OMPC.  Methods:   The present study will be conducted as a prospective, open-label, dose-escalation, phase I/II clinical trial. The patients with oligometastatic PCa will receive 1 month of naADT, followed by metastasis-directed radiation and abdominal or pelvic radiotherapy. Then, radical prostatectomy will be performed at intervals of 4-8 weeks after radiotherapy, and ADT will be continued for 2 years. The primary endpoints of the study are safety profiles, assessed by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 5.0 grading scale, and perioperativemorbidities, assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification system. The secondary endpoints include positive surgical margin (pSM), biochemical recurrence-free survival (bPFS), radiological progression-free survival (RPFS), postoperative continence, and quality of life (QoL) parameters.  Discussion:   The optimal treatment for OMPC is still on its way, prompting investigation for novel multimodality treatment protocol for this patient population. Traditionally, radical prostatectomy has been recommended as one of the standard therapies for localized prostate cancer, but indications have expanded over the years as recommended by NCCN and EAU guidelines. RP has been carried out in some centres for OMPC patients, but its value has been inconclusive, showing elevated complication risks and limited survival benefit. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy has been proven safe and effective in colorectal cancer, breast cancer and other various types of malignant tumors, showing potential advantages in terms of reducing metastatic stem-cell activity, providing clinical downstaging, and reducing potential intraoperative risks. Existing trials have shown that naRT is well tolerated for high-risk and locally-advanced prostate cancer. In this study, we hope to further determine the optimal irradiation dose and patient tolerance for genitourinary, gastrointestinal and systemic toxicities with the design of 3+3 dose escalation; also, final pathology can be obtained following RP to further determine treatment response and follow-up treatment plans.

However, historical cohorts showed that some GGG1-labeled disease at biopsy may be underestimated by the standard PCa diagnostic workup. The aim was to assess whether the risk of adverse features at radical prostatectomy (RP) in selected GGG1 patients still exists in the era of pre-biopsy mpMRI and image-guided biopsies.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed our data from a European RP dataset to assess in contemporary patients with GGG1 at mpMRI-targeted biopsy the rate of adverse features at final pathology, defined as ≥ pT3a and/or pN+ and/or GGG ≥ 3.  Results:   A total of 419 patients with cT1-T2 cN0 GGG1-PCa were included. At final pathology, 143 (34.1%) patients had adverse features. In multivariate analysis, only unfavorable intermediate-risk/high-risk disease (defined on PSA or stage) was predictive of adverse features (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.11-5.39, p = 0.02). A significant difference was observed in the 3-year biochemical recurrence-free survival between patients with and without adverse features (93.4 vs 87.8%, p = 0.026). In sensitivity analysis restricted low- and favorable intermediate-risk PCa, 122/383 patients (31.8%) had adverse features and no preoperative factors were statistically associated with this risk.  Conclusion:   In this European study, we showed that there is still a risk of underestimating GGG1 disease at biopsy despite the routine use of image-guided biopsies.

PPAT lipidomic composition study may allow us to understand the tumor metabolic microenvironment and provide new stratification factors.  Methods:   We used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based non-targeted lipidomics to profile lipids in the PPAT of 40 patients with PCa (n = 20 with low-risk and n = 20 high-risk). Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and variable importance in projection (VIP) analysis were used to identify the most relevant features of PPAT between low- and high-risk PCa, and metabolite set enrichment analysis was used to detect disrupted metabolic pathways. Metabolic crosstalk between PPAT and PCa cell lines (PC-3 and LNCaP) was studied using ex vivo experiments. Lipid uptake and lipid accumulation were measured. Lipid metabolic-related genes (SREBP1, FASN, ACACA, LIPE, PPARG, CD36, PNPLA2, FABP4, CPT1A, FATP5, ADIPOQ), inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1B, TNFα), and tumor-related markers (ESRRA, MMP-9, TWIST1) were measured by RT-qPCR.  Results:   Significant differences in the content of 67 lipid species were identified in PPAT samples between high- and low-risk PCa. PLS-DA and VIP analyses revealed a discriminating lipidomic panel between low- and high-risk PCa, suggesting the occurrence of disordered lipid metabolism in patients related to PCa aggressiveness. Functional analysis revealed that alterations in fatty acid biosynthesis, linoleic acid metabolism, and β-oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids had the greatest impact in the PPAT lipidome. Gene analyses of PPAT samples demonstrated that the expression of genes associated with de novo fatty acid synthesis such as FASN and ACACA were significantly lower in PPAT from high-risk PCa than in low-risk counterparts. This was accompanied by the overexpression of inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1B, and TNFα). Co-culture of PPAT explants with PCa cell lines revealed a reduced gene expression of lipid metabolic-related genes (CD36, FASN, PPARG, and CPT1A), contrary to that observed in co-cultured PCa cell lines. This was followed by an increase in lipid uptake and lipid accumulation in PCa cells. Tumor-related genes were increased in co-cultured PCa cell lines.

Methods:   Cohort study using UK Biobank data linked to primary care records. Participants were men with a record showing a general practice consultation for a lower urinary tract symptom. The outcome measure was prostate cancer diagnosis within 2 years of consultation. The predictor was a genetic risk score of 269 genetic variants for prostate cancer.

Objective:   To evaluate the expected population outcomes and resource use of conservative prostate-specific antigen screening programs in the Bahamas.  Design setting and participants:   Prostate cancer incidence from GLOBOCAN and prostate-specific antigen screening data for 4300 men from the Bahamas were used to recalibrate 2 decision analytical models previously used to study prostate-specific antigen screening for Black men in the United States. Data on age and results obtained from prostate-specific antigen screening tests performed in Nassau from 2004 to 2018 and in Freeport from 2013 to 2018 were used. Data were analyzed from January 15, 2021, to March 23, 2022.  Interventions:   One or 2 screenings for men aged 45 to 60 years and conservative criteria for biopsy (prostate-specific antigen level >10 ng/mL) and curative treatment (Gleason score ≥8) were modeled. Categories of Gleason scores were 6 or lower, 7, and 8 or higher, with higher scores indicating higher risk of cancer progression and death.  Main outcomes and measures:   Projected numbers of tests and biopsies, prostate cancer (over)diagnoses, lives saved, and life-years gained owing to screening from 2022 to 2040.  Results:   In this decision analytical modeling study, screening histories from 4300 men (median age, 54 years; range, 13-101 years) tested between 2004 and 2018 at 2 sites in the Bahamas were used to inform the models. Screening once at 60 years of age was projected to involve 40 000 to 42 000 tests (range between models) and prevent 500 to 600 of 10 000 to 14 000 prostate cancer deaths. Screening at 50 and 60 years doubled the number of tests but increased lives saved by only 15% to 16%. Among onetime strategies, screening once at 60 years of age involved the fewest tests per life saved (74-84 tests) and curative treatments per life saved (1.2-2.8 treatments).

Methods:   We retrospectively studied 12 061 patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2004 and 2018 from 21 institutions. These institutions were divided into five groups according to the availability of surgery and radiotherapy. Differences in primary treatment selection between the institutions were investigated, and the predictive factors involved in the selection were explored.  Results:   Surgery, radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and active surveillance/watchful waiting were selected as primary treatment in 4115, 3621, 3188, and 821 patients, respectively, while the remaining 316 patients selected other modalities. The number of patients, particularly young patients, was much higher in institutions with both surgery and radiotherapy. With the introduction of robotic surgery, open radical prostatectomy has decreased, and robotic surgery made up approximately 70% of all prostatectomies. Institutions with both surgery and radiotherapy tended to treat patients with very low or low risk by surgery or radiotherapy, while institutions without surgery and radiotherapy tended to select active surveillance or watchful waiting.

NA may demonstrate a spectrum of architectural and cytologic features mimicking urothelial carcinoma (UC), adenocarcinoma (including clear cell adenocarcinoma and prostatic adenocarcinoma), and invasion. However, admixed UC and NA has not been described.  Objective.—:   To describe cases where the NA was intimately intermixed with UC, potentially mimicking variant differentiation or invasion.  Design.—:   In 3 health care systems we identified specimens of NA and UC intimately intermixed with each other to the extent that they could mimic a spectrum of one lesion. We assessed patterns of NA and clinical implications of misdiagnosing NA as glandular differentiation of UC.  Results.—:   There were 4 women and 29 men (median age, 72 years; range, 31-89 years). Twenty-four patients had transurethral resections, 3 had biopsies, and 6 had major resections. Fourteen had noninvasive high-grade papillary UC, 6 had carcinoma in situ, and 11 had invasive high-grade UC. In 2 patients, NA developed in a papillary urothelial neoplasm with extensive denudation. Three patients had fibromyxoid NA infiltrated by invasive UC. Classical NA (n = 30) had tubulopapillary (n = 18), pure tubular (n = 7), or pure papillary architecture (n = 5). In 1 lesion, NA was present in muscularis propria, and 2 lesions involved adventitia. NA could have been misdiagnosed as invasion in 17 of 22 (77%) noninvasive tumors or higher stage in 19 of 33 (58%).  Conclusions.—:   NA can be intermingled with high-grade UC, expanding the spectrum of entities that must be considered in the differential diagnosis, as it may mimic glandular or tubular differentiation, invasion, and a higher stage of disease. Misinterpretation of NA in such a setting may incorrectly convey a more aggressive biological potential of cancer to clinicians.""","""['Oleksandr N Kryvenko', 'Matthew J Wasco', 'Sean R Williamson']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Arch Pathol Lab Med""","""['Fibromyxoid Nephrogenic Adenoma: A Series of 43 Cases Reassessing Predisposing Conditions, Clinical Presentation, and Morphology.', 'Large nested variant of urothelial carcinoma: 23 cases mimicking von Brunn nests and inverted growth pattern of noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma.', 'Urothelial Carcinoma In Situ of the Bladder With Glandular Differentiation: Report of 92 Cases.', 'Divergent differentiation in urothelial carcinoma and other bladder cancer subtypes with selected mimics.', 'Nephrogenic adenoma: an update on an innocuous but troublesome entity.']"""

The potential unfavorable impact of advanced age on oncological outcomes following RARP remains an unsettled issue. We aimed to evaluate the oncological outcome of PCa patients > 69 years old in a single tertiary center.  Materials and methods:   1143 patients with clinically localized PCa underwent RARP from January 2013 to October 2020. Analysis was performed on 901 patients with available follow-up. Patients ≥ 70 years old were considered elderly. Unfavorable pathology included ISUP grade group > 2, seminal vesicle, and pelvic lymph node invasion. Disease progression was defined as biochemical and/or local recurrence and/or distant metastases.  Results:   243 cases (27%) were classified as elderly patients (median age 72 years). Median (IQR) follow-up was 40.4 (38.7-42.2) months. Disease progression occurred in 159 cases (17.6%). Elderly patients were more likely to belong to EAU high-risk class, have unfavorable pathology, and experience disease progression after surgery (HR = 5.300; 95% CI 1.844-15.237; p = 0.002) compared to the younger patients.  Conclusions:   Elderly patients eligible for RARP are more likely to belong to the EAU high-risk category and to have unfavorable pathology that are independent predictors of disease progression. Advanced age adversely impacts on oncological outcomes when evaluated inside these unfavorable categories. Accordingly, elderly patients belonging to the EAU high-risk should be counseled about the increased risk of disease progression after surgery.""","""['Antonio Benito Porcaro', 'Alberto Bianchi', 'Sebastian Gallina', 'Emanuele Serafin', 'Giovanni Mazzucato', 'Stefano Vidiri', ""Damiano D'Aietti"", 'Riccardo Rizzetto', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Clara Cerrato', 'Andrea Panunzio', 'Rossella Orlando', 'Davide Brusa', 'Matteo Brunelli', 'Salvatore Siracusano', 'Maria Angela Cerruto', 'Alessandro Antonelli']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Aging Clin Exp Res""","""['Normal preoperative endogenous testosterone levels predict prostate cancer progression in elderly patients after radical prostatectomy.', 'Technical Refinements in Superextended Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy for Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer Patients at Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging.', 'Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy and Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Patients with Locally-advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Best practices in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: recommendations of the Pasadena Consensus Panel.', 'Advanced age is an independent prognostic factor of disease progression in high-risk prostate cancer: results in 180 patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection in a tertiary referral center.', 'Prognostic Impact and Clinical Implications of Unfavorable Upgrading in Low-Risk Prostate Cancer after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results of a Single Tertiary Referral Center.']"""

Methods:   Three hundred thirty-seven [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images were retrieved from a cohort of biochemically recurrent PCa patients. A fully 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed which is based on the self-configuring nnU-Net framework, and was trained on a subset of these scans, with an independent test set reserved for model evaluation. Voxel-level segmentation results were assessed using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC), positive predictive value (PPV), and sensitivity. Sensitivity and PPV were calculated to assess lesion level detection; patient-level classification results were assessed by the accuracy, PPV, and sensitivity. Whole-body biomarkers total lesional volume (TLVauto) and total lesional uptake (TLUauto) were calculated from the automated segmentations, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess biomarker relationship with patient overall survival.  Results:   At the patient level, the accuracy, sensitivity, and PPV were all > 90%, with the best metric being the PPV (97.2%). PPV and sensitivity at the lesion level were 88.2% and 73.0%, respectively. DSC and PPV measured at the voxel level performed within measured inter-observer variability (DSC, median = 50.7% vs. second observer = 32%, p = 0.012; PPV, median = 64.9% vs. second observer = 25.7%, p < 0.005).

Here, the risk of prostate cancer incidence and mortality following a benign histological assessment of TURP is investigated in a population-based setting.  Methods:   Between 1995 and 2016, 64,059 men in Denmark underwent TURP without prior biopsy of the prostate; 42,558 of these men had benign histology. The risks of prostate cancer, prostate cancer with a Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4, and prostate cancer-specific death were assessed with competing risks. Specific risks for pre-TURP prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels at 10 and 15 years were visualized by locally estimated scatterplot smoothing.  Results:   The median age at TURP was 72 years (interquartile range [IQR], 65-78 years), and the median follow-up was 15 years (IQR, 10-19 years). The 10-year risks of any prostate cancer and prostate cancer with a Gleason score ≥ 3 + 4 and the 15-year risk of prostate cancer death showed clear visual relations with increasing PSA. The 15-year cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific death after benign TURP was 1.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3%-1.6%) for all men and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.6%-1.1%) for men with PSA levels <10 ng/ml. The primary limitation was exclusion due to missing PSA data.  Conclusions:   Men with low PSA levels and a benign TURP can be reassured about their cancer risk and do not need to be monitored differently than any other men. Patients with high PSA levels can be considered for further follow-up with prostate magnetic resonance imaging. These findings add to the literature suggesting that normal histology from the prostate entails a low risk of death from the disease.  Lay summary:   There is little knowledge about the oncological risks after the surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This study shows a very low risk of adverse oncological outcomes in men with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels below 10 ng/ml at the time of transurethral resection of the prostate. Patients with higher PSA levels may need more extensive follow-up.""","""['Maria Hilscher', 'Andreas Røder', 'J Thomas Helgstrand', 'Nina Klemann', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Andrew Julian Vickers', 'Hein Vincent Stroomberg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['""Finding the needle in a haystack"": oncologic evaluation of patients treated for LUTS with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) versus transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).', 'The diagnostic value of prostate cancer between holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia: A retrospective comparative study.', 'Prostate stem cell antigen mRNA expression in preoperatively negative biopsy specimens predicts subsequent cancer after transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Functional Outcomes and Complications Following Transurethral Procedures for Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Resulting from Benign Prostatic Obstruction: An Update.', 'Microwave thermotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Learning Curve of Transperineal MRI/US Fusion Prostate Biopsy: 4-Year Experience.', 'Fact, overdiagnosis cannot be evaluated by comparing histological grading of prostate biopsy to prostatectomy specimen.']"""

However, a highly-efficient therapy for this tumor subtype is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the relationship between TP53 mutation status and autophagy in prostate cancer and assessed the efficacy of autophagy inhibitors on TP53-deficient tumors.  Methods:   We first evaluated the expression patterns of p53 and autophagy-related proteins, namely LC3B, ULK1 and BECLIN1, as well as their relationship in treatment-naïve and castration-resistant prostate cancer specimens through immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, we generated a Trp53-deleted genetically-engineered mouse model, established prostate tumor organoid lines from the mice and assessed the efficacy of autophagy inhibitors in overcoming Enzalutamide resistance in the tumor organoid model. We also investigated the impact of TP53 re-expression in modulating responses to autophagy inhibitors using LNCaP cell line, which harbored a TP53 missense mutation. Lastly, we attempted to identify potential autophagy-related genes that were crucial for TP53-deficient tumor maintenance.  Results:   TP53 loss-of-function was associated with increased levels of autophagy-related proteins in aggressive prostate cancers and Trp53-deleted genetically-engineered mouse-derived tumors. Moreover, the generated androgen receptor-independent tumor organoids were highly vulnerable to autophagy inhibition. Upon TP53 re-expression, not only did the surviving LNCaP cells demonstrate resistance, but they also showed growth advantage in response to autophagy inhibition. Lastly, PEX14, an important peroxisomal regulator was differentially upregulated in aggressive tumors with TP53 loss-of-function mutations, thus implying the importance of peroxisome turnover in this tumor subtype.

In primary prostate cancer tissues, MAPK8IP2 mRNA expression levels were significantly higher than those in the case-matched benign prostatic tissues. Increased MAPK8IP2 expression was strongly correlated with late tumor stages, lymph node invasion, residual tumors after surgery, higher Gleason scores, and preoperational serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. MAPK8IP2 upregulation was significantly associated with worse overall survival outcomes and progression-free intervals. In castration-resistant prostate cancers, MAPK8IP2 expression strongly correlated with androgen receptor (AR) signaling activity. In cell culture-based experiments, MAPK8IP2 expression was stimulated by androgens in AR-positive prostate cancer cells. However, MAPK8IP2 expression was blocked by AR antagonists only in androgen-sensitive LNCaP but not castration-resistant C4-2B and 22RV1 cells. These results indicate that MAPK8IP2 is a robust prognostic factor and therapeutic biomarker for prostate cancer. The potential role of MAPK8IP2 in the castration-resistant progression is under further investigation.""","""['Jian Huang', 'Wang Liu', 'Bi-Yun Lin', 'Jean C Li', 'Jane Lu', 'Ben-Yi Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['PAQR6 Upregulation Is Associated with AR Signaling and Unfavorite Prognosis in Prostate Cancers.', 'RELA is sufficient to mediate interleukin-1 repression of androgen receptor expression and activity in an LNCaP disease progression model.', 'RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'RNA-seq reveals novel mechanistic targets of Livin in bladder cancer.', 'Cell fate determination and lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.', 'Jumonji domain-containing protein RIOX2 is overexpressed and associated with worse survival outcomes in prostate cancers.', 'TMEM158 expression is negatively regulated by AR signaling and associated with favorite survival outcomes in prostate cancers.']"""

Methods:   We investigated associations between ambient concentrations particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and incident prostate cancer in a Canadian case-control study. Between 1994 and 1997, cases were identified from provincial cancer registries, and a population-based series of controls was recruited. Among men 50 years of age or older, risk factor and residential history data (1975 to 1994) were collected from 1,420 prostate cancer cases and 1,424 controls. Three methods were used to estimate the residential mean exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 during this period: (1) satellite-derived observations; (2) satellite-derived observations scaled with historical fixed-site measurements; and (3) a national land-use regression (LUR) model. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in relation to interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM2.5 and NO2 were estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for personal and contextual factors.  Results:   We found positive associations between exposure to PM2.5 and NO2 over the previous 20 years and prostate cancer. An IQR increase in PM2.5 (3.56 µg/m3 for satellite and 4.48 µg/m3 for scaled satellite observations) yielded ORs of 1.28 (95% CI = 1.07, 1.52) and 1.20 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.40), respectively. For NO2, IQR increases (1.45 ppb for satellite, 15.18 ppb for scaled satellite-derived information, and 15.39 ppb for the national LUR) were associated with ORs of 1.09 (95% CI = 0.95, 1.24), 1.21 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.43), and 1.19 (95% CI = 1.03, 1.38), respectively.

Our objective was to describe patterns of 0.35 Tesla (T)-MRgRT utilization in Europe and Asia among early adopters of this novel technology.  Methods:   Anonymized administrative data from all 0.35T-MRgRT treatment systems in Europe and Asia were extracted for patients who completed treatment from 2015 to 2020. Detailed treatment information was analyzed for all MR-linear accelerators (linac) and -cobalt systems.  Results:   From 2015 through the end of 2020, there were 5796 completed treatment courses delivered in 46,389 individual fractions. 23.5% of fractions were adapted. Ultra-hypofractionated (UHfx) dose schedules (1-5 fractions) were delivered for 63.5% of courses, with 57.8% of UHfx fractions adapted on-table. The most commonly treated tumor types were prostate (23.5%), liver (14.5%), lung (12.3%), pancreas (11.2%), and breast (8.0%), with increasing compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) in numbers of courses from 2015 through 2020 (pancreas: 157.1%; prostate: 120.9%; lung: 136.0%; liver: 134.2%).  Conclusions:   This is the first comprehensive study reporting patterns of utilization among early adopters of a 0.35T-MRgRT system in Europe and Asia. Intrafraction MR image-guidance, advanced motion management, and increasing adoption of on-table adaptive RT have accelerated a transition to UHfx regimens.

Objective:   To evaluate associations between coffee intake, caffeine metabolism genotype, and survival in a large, multicenter study of men with prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   Data from The PRACTICAL Consortium database for 5727 men with prostate cancer from seven US, Australian, and European studies were included. The cases included had data available for the CYP1A2 -163C>A rs762551 single-nucleotide variant associated with caffeine metabolism, coffee intake, and >6 mo of follow-up.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models across pooled patient-level data were used to compare the effect of coffee intake (categorized as low [reference], high, or none/very low) in relation to overall survival (OS) and prostate cancer-specific survival (PCSS), with stratified analyses conducted by clinical disease risk and genotype.  Results and limitations:   High coffee intake appeared to be associated with longer PCSS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.08; p = 0.18) and OS (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77-1.07; p = 0.24), although results were not statistically significant. In the group with clinically localized disease, high coffee intake was associated with longer PCSS (HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.44-0.98; p = 0.040), with comparable results for the group with advanced disease (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.69-1.23; p = 0.6). High coffee intake was associated with longer PCSS among men with the CYP1A2 AA (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93; p = 0.017) but not the AC/CC genotype (p = 0.8); an interaction was detected (p = 0.042). No associations with OS were observed in subgroup analyses (p > 0.05). Limitations include the nominal statistical significance and residual confounding.  Conclusions:   Coffee intake was associated with longer PCSS among men with a CYP1A2 -163AA (*1F/*1F) genotype, a finding that will require further replication.

Objectives:   The aims of the study are to determine and to compare the rate of aPSM in men with versus without prospectively flagged at-risk prostate lesions during clinical mpMRI interpretation using whole-mount histopathology as the reference standard.  Methods:   This single-center, retrospective study of prospectively collected data included treatment-naive men with abnormal 3T mpMRI (PI-RADS v2 score ≥3) between January 2016 and December 2018 followed by surgery. During routine clinical interpretation, radiologists flagged prostate lesions abutting the apical most gland and/or encircling the distal most prostatic urethra using standardized language available as a ""pick list"" option in the structured report. Logistic regression was used to compare the rate of PSM in 2 groups (flagged vs nonflagged men). Propensity score covariate adjustment corrected for potential selection bias according to age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density, grade group, and pT stage. The estimate was further adjusted by including surgeon as a covariate.  Results:   A total of 428 men were included. A statistically significant higher proportion of aPSMs was noted in flagged (56% [51/91]) compared with nonflagged apical lesions (31% [105/337]; adjusted odds ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-4.1; P < 0.01). The difference in aPSM between both groups also varied according to the surgeon performing the RP. Prostate-specific antigen, PSA density, lesion size, apical location, Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System score, grade group, pT stage, and surgeon's experience were associated with higher PSM rate. Biochemical recurrence, defined as PSA greater than 0.2 ng/mL on 2 measurements after RP, was significantly associated with PSM status (propensity score adjusted odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.8-5.3; P < 0.0001); however, patients flagged by radiologists did not have a significant difference in biochemical recurrence rates as compared with nonflagged patients ( P = 0.11).  Conclusions:   Standard language built into structured reports for mpMRI of the prostate helps identify preoperatively patients at risk for aPSM.

Methods:   We used the Age-Period-Cohort approach to estimate the annual age-specific incidence in each LGA and used Bayesian spatiotemporal models that account for non-linear temporal trends and area-level risk factors. We evaluated the models' performance by withholding and comparing forecasts with the 2014-2018 data.  Results:   There were 80,449 prostate cancer cases between 2001 and 2018, with an overall increasing trend. Compared to 2001, prostate cancer incidence increased by 69%, from 3049 to 5167 cases in 2018. Prostate cancer counts are expected to reach 7631 cases in 2028, a further 48% increase. Unexplained area-level spatial variation was substantially reduced after adjusting for the area-level elderly population. Aggressive prostate cancer cases increased by 107% between 2001 and 2018 and are expected to rise by 123% increase in 2028. The proportion of aggressive prostate cancer cases will increase to 31% in 2028 from 20% in 2018. By 2028, overall and aggressive prostate cancer cases are projected to be increasing in 66% and 61% of LGAs.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer cases are projected to rise at the state level and most LGAs in the next 10 years, with much steeper increases in aggressive cases.

BRAF fusions represent a paradigm of uncommon and targetable oncogenic events and have been widely correlated to the development of specific malignancies. However, they are only present in a limited frequency across most common tumor types. At this regard, we performed a genomic screening aimed to identifying rare variants associated to advanced prostate cancer development.  Methods:   Tumoral tissue genomic screening of 41 patients developing advanced prostate cancer was performed at our center as part of the GETHI XX study. The project, sponsored by the Spanish Collaborative Group in Rare Cancers (GETHI), aims to analyze the molecular background of rare tumors and to discover unfrequent molecular variants in common tumors.  Results:   Here we present the clinical outcome and an in-deep molecular analysis performed in a case harboring a SND1-BRAF fusion gene. The identification of such rearrangement in a patient refractory to standard therapies led to the administration of trametinib (MEK inhibitor). Despite unsensitive to standard therapies, the patient achieved a dramatic response to trametinib. A comprehensive study of the tumor demonstrated this event to be a trunk alteration with higher expression of MEK in areas of tumor invasion.

New biomarkers and technologies to detect them are therefore needed to better diagnose and stratify patients in primary care. Circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) has gained interest as a potential minimally invasive biomarker, detectable in many bodily fluids (such as blood, urine, and cerebral spinal fluid) and reflecting the mutational landscape in tumors. More recently, the size distribution of ccfDNA fragments has also gained interest as a specific biomarker, where differences in size distribution have been observed between healthy volunteers and cancer patients, resulting in the new field of fragmentomics. Analysis of ccfDNA sizes provides avenues for alternative analytical technologies but commercial options are currently limited.

De-regulated cytokine and chemokine signaling facilitates critical communication between tumor cells and multiple cell lineages within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Historical attempts at using targeted approaches to disrupt inflammation have been disappointing, with sub-optimal or negligible clinical benefit. Our increased awareness of the myeloid infiltrate in supporting the acquisition of castrate resistance and underpinning the abject response of advanced PCa to immunotherapy has re-focused attention on improved strategies to disrupt these complex cytokine and chemokine signaling networks within the TME. These ongoing and prospective strategies are principally focused on employing cytokine-/chemokine-directed therapies in informed combination with androgen signaling inhibitors or immunotherapeutic agents and, increasingly, with due consideration of the genetic context of the tumor. The availability of molecular-targeted therapeutic agents directed against the critical signal transduction nodes activated by cytokine and chemokine signaling in tumor cells provides opportunities to reduce the impacts of biological redundancy.

Methods:   A back-calculation method was used to estimate the number of individuals living with metastatic cancer for each cancer type from US cancer mortality and survival statistics from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. The percentages of those living with metastatic cancer who advanced to metastatic disease from early stage cancer vs who were diagnosed with metastatic cancer de novo were calculated. One- and 5-year relative survival rates for de novo metastatic cancer were compared by year of diagnosis to assess time trends in survival.  Results:   It is estimated that, in 2018, 623 405 individuals were living with metastatic breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, or bladder cancer, or metastatic melanoma in the United States. This number is expected to increase to 693 452 in 2025. In 2018, the percentage of metastatic cancer survivors who were initially diagnosed with early stage cancer and advanced to metastatic cancer ranged from 30% for lung cancer to 72% for bladder cancer.

Patients and methods:   A prospective study in a subgroup of patients from a multicentre randomized controlled trial was conducted between 2014 and 2017, including 665 men with prior negative SB with a persistent elevated prostate-specific antigen and/or suspicious digital rectal examination undergoing mpMRI. All patients with negative SB and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) ≤2 on mpMRI entered biochemical follow-up. Follow-up data until December 2021 were collected by reviewing institutional hospital records and the Dutch Pathology Registry (PALGA). The primary outcome was the observed number of csPCa (Gleason ≥3 + 4/International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥2) cases during follow-up compared to the expected number in the general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR]).  Results:   In total, 431 patients had non-suspicious mpMRI and entered biochemical follow-up. After a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 41 (23-57) months, 38 patients were diagnosed with PCa, of whom 13 (3.0%) had csPCa. The SIR for csPCa was 4.3 (95% confidence interval 2.3-7.4; total excess of eight cases). A higher risk of a positive biopsy for (cs)PCa based on the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer risk calculator and a suspicious repeat MRI (PI-RADS ≥3) were significant predictive factors for csPCa.  Conclusion:   After negative prior biopsy and non-suspicious mpMRI the risk of csPCa is low.

Nonetheless, they have been criticized due to the potential for time trends in the underlying risk level of the population. Such time trends lead to confounding between design features and risk level, which may introduce bias favoring one or more treatments. This is particularly true when experimental treatments are not all randomized during the same time period as the control, leading to the potential for bias from non-concurrent controls.  Methods:   Two analysis methods addressing this bias are stratification and adjustment. Stratification uses only comparisons between treatment cohorts randomized during identical time periods and does not use non-concurrent randomizations. Adjustment uses a modeled analysis including time period adjustment, allowing all data to be used, even from periods without concurrent randomization. We show that these competing approaches may be embedded in a common framework using network meta-analysis principles. We interpret the stages between adaptations in a platform trial as separate fixed design trials. This allows platform trials to be viewed as networks of direct randomized comparisons and indirect non-randomized comparisons. Network meta-analysis methodology can be re-purposed to aggregate the total information from a platform trial and to transparently decompose this total information into direct randomized evidence and indirect non-randomized evidence. This allows sensitivity to indirect information to be assessed and the two analysis methods to be clearly compared.  Results:   Simulations of platform trials were analyzed using a network approach implemented in the netmeta package in R. The results demonstrated bias of unadjusted methods in the presence of time trends in risk level. Adjustment and stratification were both unbiased when direct evidence and indirect evidence were consistent. Network tests of inconsistency may be used to diagnose inconsistency when it exists. In an illustrative network analysis of one of the treatment comparisons from the STAMPEDE platform trial in metastatic prostate cancer, indirect comparisons using non-concurrent controls were inconsistent with the information from direct randomized comparisons. This supports the primary analysis approach of STAMPEDE, which used only direct randomized comparisons.  Conclusion:   Network meta-analysis provides a natural methodology for analyzing the network of direct and indirect treatment comparisons from a platform trial. Such analyses provide transparent separation of direct and indirect evidence, allowing assessment of the impact of non-concurrent controls. We recommend time-stratified analysis of concurrently controlled comparisons for primary analyses, with time-adjusted analyses incorporating non-concurrent controls reserved for secondary analyses. However, regardless of which methodology is used, a network analysis provides a useful supplement to the primary analysis.""","""['Ian C Marschner', 'I Manjula Schou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Trials""","""['The future of Cochrane Neonatal.', 'Network Meta-analysis on Disconnected Evidence Networks When Only Aggregate Data Are Available: Modified Methods to Include Disconnected Trials and Single-Arm Studies while Minimizing Bias.', 'Changing platforms without stopping the train: experiences of data management and data management systems when adapting platform protocols by adding and closing comparisons.', 'Ablation: Atrial fibrillation: diagnosis and management: Network meta-analysis J2.', 'Oral antiviral therapy for prevention of genital herpes outbreaks in immunocompetent and nonpregnant patients.', 'Commentary: Two approaches to analyze platform trials incorporating non-concurrent controls with a common assumption.']"""

However, clinicians have few effective prognostic tools to individually assess survival in patients with PCa.  Methods:   We screened 283,252 patients diagnosed with PCa from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 2004 and 2015, and randomly divided them into the training and validation groups. We used univariate and multivariate Cox analyses to identify independent prognostic factors and further established nomograms to predict 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) for PCa patients. The prediction performance of nomograms was tested and externally validated by Concordance index (C-index) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used for internal validation. We further developed PCa prognostic scoring system based on the impact of available variables on survival.  Results:   The variables age, race, marital status, TNM stage, surgery method, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, PSA value, and Gleason score identified as independent prognostic factors were included in the survival nomograms. The results of training (C-index: OS = 0.776, CSS = 0.889; AUC value: OS = 0.772-0.802, CSS = 0.892-0.936) and external validation (C-index: OS = 0.759, CSS = 0.875) indicated our nomograms had good performance in predicting 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year OS and CSS prediction. Internal validation using the calibration curves and DCA curves demonstrated the effectiveness of the prediction models. The prognostic scoring system was more effective than the AJCC staging system in predicting the survival of PCa patients, especially for OS.  Conclusion:   The prognostic nomograms and prognostic scoring system have favorable performance in predicting OS and CSS of PCa patients.

Materials and methods:   Plasma samples were collected from GC patients (n = 64), IBS patients (n = 64), GERD patients (n = 64), gastritis patients (n = 64), PU patients (n = 64), and healthy controls (HCs, n = 64). Paired GC and non-tumor samples were from all GC patients (n = 64). Tissue and plasma samples were subjected to RT-qPCR to determine circSOBP expression. The role of circSOBP in distinguishing GC patients from other patients was analyzed by ROC curve. The 64 patients were followed up for 5 years to study the role of circSOBP in predicting the survival of GC patients.  Results:   Decreased circSOBP RNA accumulation was observed in GC tissues compared to normal tissue samples. Decreased plasma circSOBP accumulation was only observed in GC patients, but not other patients, compared to HCs. With plasma circSOBP as a biomarker, GC patients were separated from other patients and HCs. Patients with high plasma or tissue levels of circSOBP showed better survival conditions. In addition, plasma and tissue circSOBP levels were only closely correlated with GC patients' tumor metastasis, but not other clinical factors.

Therefore, this study aimed to perform bioinformatics analysis to examine the correlation of ANLN with tumor immune infiltration, immune evasion, tumor progression, immunotherapy, and tumor prognosis. We observed increased ANLN expression in multiple tumors, which could be involved in tumor cell proliferation, migration, infiltration, and prognosis. The level of ANLN methylation and genetic alteration was associated with prognosis in numerous tumors. ANLN facilitates tumor immune evasion through different mechanisms, which involve T-cell exclusion in different cancer types and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in colon adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, liver hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. Additionally, ANLN is correlated with immune or chemotherapeutic outcomes in malignant cancers. Notably, ANLN expression may be a predictive biomarker for the response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Here, we report in vitro evaluations of PARPi (-/+ PARP trapper temozolomide, TMZ) with reference to total clinical mean concentration average or maximum (tCavg, tCmax), to elucidate contributions of primary pharmacology and structural differences to clinical efficacy and safety. In biochemical assays, rucaparib and niraparib demonstrated off-target secondary pharmacology activities, and in selectivity assays, talazoparib, olaparib, and rucaparib inhibited a broader panel of PARP enzymes. In donor-derived human bone marrow mononuclear cells, only olaparib both increased early apoptosis and decreased the cell viability half inhibitory concentration (IC50) at ≤ tCavg, whereas other PARPi only did so in the presence of TMZ. In cancer cell lines with DNA damage repair mutations, all PARPi decreased cell viability in H1048 but not TK6 cells, and only talazoparib decreased cell growth in DU145 cells at ≤ tCavg concentrations. When combined with low dose TMZ, only talazoparib left-shifted the functional consequences of PARP trapping (S-phase arrest, apoptosis, S-phase double-stranded breaks) and reduced cell viability/growth in TK6 and DU145 cell lines at ≤ tCavg, whereas the other inhibitors required high-dose TMZ.

The main purpose of this study was to explore the application of %p2PSA and prostate health index (phi) in predicting BM of PCa before bone scanning to reduce unnecessary bone scanning.  Methods:   A total of 279 PCa patients were enrolled in our study. The area under the ROC curve was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the variables. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to establish a prediction model. A multivariate regression model was established to evaluate the predictive value of the variables. The nomogram model was established by R software. The patients were stratified into an intermediate-risk subgroup (T2b-T2c, Gleason score = 6-7) and a high-risk subgroup (cT3-4, Gleason score = 8-10). In the overall cohort and subgroups, McNemar's test was used for comparison of different predictive variables.  Results:   Of the 279 patients included in the study, 43 patients were identified as having BM by bone scanning. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that age (p = 0.043), tPSA (p = 0.001), Ki-67 (p = 0.003), Gleason score (p = 0.001), clinical T stage (p < 0.001) and phi (p < 0.001) were significantly different in BM patients. In multivariate regression analysis, the model with phi showed significant diagnostic ability for predicting BM (AUC = 0.854). In the subgroup analysis, phi was significantly superior to tPSA in terms of the positive predictive value at sensitivities of 84.62% and 61.54% in the overall cohort (p < 0.001) and intermediate-risk subgroup (p < 0.001), respectively. Moreover, %p2PSA showed no significant advantage over tPSA (p > 0.05).  Conclusion:   The level of phi was significantly related to the positive rate of BM in initially diagnosed PCa. In PCa patients with clinical stage T2b-T2c and Gleason score = 6-7, phi can be used as a surrogate indicator of tPSA for screening BM.""","""['Haoyu Sun#', 'Yaofeng Zhu#', 'Hongda Guo', 'Songlin Jiang', 'Hu Guo', 'Shouzhen Chen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Clinical value of serum isoform -2 proprostate-specific antigen and its derivatives in predicting aggressive prostate cancer.', 'Usefulness of the prostate health index in predicting the presence and aggressiveness of prostate cancer among Korean men: a prospective observational study.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Clinical performance of serum -2proPSA derivatives, %p2PSA and PHI, in the detection and management of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Objectives:   We modeled the cumulative effects of common risk alleles and their prevalence variations with classical risk factors.  Methods:   We analyzed mathematically and statistically numbers and effect sizes of established risk alleles for coronary artery disease (CAD) and other conditions.  Results:   In UK Biobank, risk alleles counts in the lowest (175.4) and highest decile (205.7) of the distribution differed by only 16.9%, which nevertheless increased CAD prevalence 3.4-fold (p < 0.01). Irrespective of the affected gene, a single risk allele multiplied the effects of all others carried by a person, resulting in a 2.9-fold stronger effect size in the top versus the bottom decile (p < 0.01) and an exponential increase in risk (R > 0.94). Classical risk factors shifted effect sizes to the steep upslope of the logarithmic function linking risk allele numbers with CAD prevalence. Similar phenomena were observed in the Estonian Biobank and for risk alleles affecting diabetes mellitus, breast and prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Alleles predisposing to common diseases can be carried safely in large numbers, but few additional ones lead to sharp risk increments. Here, we describe exponential functions by which risk alleles combine interchangeably but multiplicatively with each other and with modifiable risk factors to affect prevalence.

Methods:   The cohort included 2209 consecutive men undergoing radical prostatectomy at 2 academic institutions with pT2N0, Grade Group 1-4 prostate cancer and an undetectable postoperative PSA. Volume of benign, GP3, and GP4 were estimated. The primary analysis evaluated the association between PSA and volume of each type of tissue using multivariable linear regression. R2, a measure of explained variation, was calculated using a multivariable model.  Results:   Estimated contribution to PSA was 0.04/0.06 ng/mL/cc for benign, 0.08/0.14 ng/mL/cc for GP3, and 0.62/0.80 ng/ml/cc for GP4 for the 2 independent cohorts, respectively. GP4 was associated with 6 to 8-fold more PSA per cc compared to GP3 and 15-fold higher compared to benign tissue. We did not observe a difference between PSA per cc for GP3 vs. benign tissue (P = 0.2). R2 decreased only slightly when removing age (0.006/0.018), volume of benign tissue (0.051/0.054) or GP3 (0.014/0.023) from the model. When GP4 was removed, R2 decreased 0.051/0.310. PSA density (PSA divided by prostate volume) was associated with volume of GP4 but not GP3, after adjustment for benign volume.  Conclusion:   Gleason pattern 4 cancer contributes considerably more to PSA and PSA density per unit volume compared to GP3 and benign tissue. Contributions from GP3 and benign are similar.

PSMA expression correlates with the malignancy of PCa, and its dimeric form can promote tumor progression by exerting enzymatic activity to activate downstream signal transduction. However, almost no studies have shown that arresting the procancer signaling of the PSMA receptors themselves can cause tumor cell death. Meanwhile, supramolecular self-assembling peptides are widely used to design anticancer agents due to their unique and excellent properties. Here, a PSMA-targeting supramolecular self-assembling nanotheranostic agent, DBT-2FFGACUPA, which actively targets PSMA receptors on PCa cell membranes and induces them to enter the cell and form large aggregates, is developed. This process not only selectively images PSMA-positive tumor cells but also suppresses the downstream procancer signals of PSMA, causing tumor cell death.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the immunostaining of candidate proteins (PTEN, AKT, TRPM8, and NKX3.1) through the immunohistochemistry technique (IHC) on patients with metastatic and non-metastatic PCa.  Methods:   Tissues from 60 patients were divided into three groups categorized according to prognostic parameters: better prognosis (n = 20), worse prognosis (n = 23), and metastatic (n = 17). Immunostaining was analyzed by a pathologist and staining classifications were considered according to signal intensity: (0) no staining, (+) weak, and (++ and +++) intermediate to strong.  Results:   AKT protein was associated (p = 0.012) and correlated (p = 0.014; Tau = - 0.288) with the prognostic groups. The immunostaining for TRPM8 (p = 0.010) and NKX3.1 (p = 0.003) proteins differed between malignant tumor and non-tumoral adjacent tissue as well as for proteins in cellular locations (nucleus and cytoplasm). TRPM8 was independently associated with the ISUP grade ≥ 4 (p = 0.024; OR = 8.373; 95% CI = 1.319-53.164).

All metastatic samples had positive immunostaining, with strong intensity for NKX3.1 (p = 0.021; Tau = - 0.302). In the non-metastatic group, this strong protein staining was not observed in any patients.

To determine whether less intensive follow-up is suitable following negative biopsy findings, we assessed the risk of converting to active treatment, any subsequent upgrading, volume progression (>33% positive cores), and serious upgrading (grade group >2) for negative compared with positive findings on initial follow-up biopsy.  Methods:   13,161 men from 24 centres participating in the Global Action Plan Active Surveillance Prostate Cancer [GAP3] consortium database, with baseline grade group ≤2, PSA ≤ 20 ng/mL, cT-stage 1-2, diagnosed after 1995, and ≥1 follow-up biopsy, were included in this study. Risk of converting to treatment was assessed using multivariable mixed-effects survival regression. Odds of volume progression, any upgrading and serious upgrading were assessed using mix-effects binary logistic regression for men with ≥2 surveillance biopsies.  Results:   27% of the cohort (n = 3590) had no evidence of PCa at their initial biopsy. Over 50% of subsequent biopsies in this group were also negative.

Methods:   We identified all men who with suspicious lesions on mpMRI and underwent TP TBx (3-core) and concomitant SBx (20-core) in our single hospital from September 2019 to February 2021. Clinical, MRI and biopsy pathological characteristics were evaluated and compared between TBx and SBx. Grade group 2 or greater prostate adenocarcinoma was defined as csPCa.  Results:   Three hundred and one (n = 301) men were included. The median prostate volume by MRI was 45 ml.

Patients in the ≤30ml group showed significantly higher frequency of combined (both TBx and/or SBx) csPCa detection rate (65.0%) than patients in the >45ml group (39.5%) but similar frequency to the >30 to ≤45 ml group (54.2%,). By TBx only (55.0% vs 27.9%) or by SBx only (56.7% vs. 34.0%), patients in the ≤30ml group consistently showed significantly higher rates of csPCa detection than patients in the >45 ml group. In the ≤30ml group, the detection rate of csPCa was comparable by TBx, SBx or when combined. Four of 6 csPCa cases missed by TBx but detected by SBx were present at the base location.

Results:   Of the 206 PCa foci at RP (117 index and 89 non-index), 74% (152/206) were detected by mpMRI.

Patients with concomitant steroid use had a significantly lower rate of antibody titer ≥15 U/mL than those without steroid use (82% vs. 95%, P = 0.021). Patients with CRPC with concomitant steroid use (n =21) also had a lower rate of antibody titer ≥15 U/mL (71%) than those without steroid use (93%, P = 0.051), although this was not statistically different. Increased number of systemic treatments administered after diagnosis of CRPC (3 lines or more) were significantly associated with antibody titers <15 U/mL (97% vs. 77%, P <0.001).  Conclusion:   The humoral response to the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine was significantly lower in patients with concomitant steroid use.

We sought to compare the differential effects of the diagnosis of 3 major urologic malignancies on QOL.  Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Health Outcomes Survey database was queried for patients who completed a QOL questionnaire (SF-36 or VR-12) before and after a diagnosis of bladder, kidney, or prostate cancer. Primary outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS), and physical component summary (PCS) scores. Mixed effects linear regression was performed with cancer diagnosis as the primary variable of interest, with race and cardiovascular comorbidity status included as potentially confounding independent variables.  Results:   There were 3,258 patients with urologic cancers. Both MCS and PCS scores dropped after diagnosis in all disease states. Bladder and kidney cancer patients demonstrated the greatest decline in MCS score (-1.762 points, 95% CI-2.571 to -0.952, P < 0.001) and PCS score (-3.769 points, 95% CI-5.042 to -2.496, P < 0.001), respectively, after adjustment for potential confounders. By contrast, prostate cancer patients demonstrated the smallest decline in both domains. Race and cardiovascular comorbidity status were independently associated with QOL, with an association 2 to 3 times greater than that of cancer diagnosis.  Conclusions:   Diagnosis of a urologic cancer was associated with a decline in patient-reported QOL, particularly in those with bladder or kidney cancer. Changes in physical health were more prominent than in mental health. Race and cardiovascular comorbidity status influenced QOL domains to a greater extent than specific urologic cancer diagnosis.""","""['Ridwan Alam', 'Sunil H Patel', 'Max R Kates', 'Nirmish Singla', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Mohamad E Allaf', 'Trinity J Bivalacqua', 'Phillip M Pierorazio']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Self-reported quality of life as a predictor of mortality in renal cell carcinoma.', 'The effect of disease severity markers on quality of life in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: a systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression.', 'Impact of poor mental health in adult spinal deformity patients with poor physical function: a retrospective analysis with a 2-year follow-up.', 'Associations of Medicaid Expansion With Insurance Coverage, Stage at Diagnosis, and Treatment Among Patients With Genitourinary Malignant Neoplasms.', 'Screening for urologic malignancies in primary care: pros, cons, and recommendations.']"""

Our ability to assess response rates and therefore efficacy may be improved using predictive tools. This study investigated the predictive value of serial 177Lu-PSMA-617 SPECT/CT (177Lu SPECT) imaging in monitoring treatment response. Methods: Fifty-six men with progressive mCRPC previously treated with chemotherapy and novel androgen signaling inhibitor were enrolled into the LuPIN trial and received up to 6 doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 and a radiation sensitizer (3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2H-1-benzopyran-7-ol [NOX66]). 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-FDG PET/CT were performed at study entry and exit, and 177Lu SPECT from vertex to mid thighs was performed 24 h after each treatment. SPECT quantitative analysis was undertaken at cycles 1 (baseline) and 3 (week 12) of treatment. Results: Thirty-two of the 56 men had analyzable serial 177Lu SPECT imaging at both cycle 1 and cycle 3. In this subgroup, median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.3 mo (95% CI, 5-10 mo) and median overall survival was 12.3 mo (95% CI, 12-24 mo). The PSA 50% response rate was 63% (20/32). 177Lu SPECT total tumor volume (SPECT TTV) was reduced in 68% (22/32; median, -0.20 m3 [95% CI, -1.4 to -0.001]) and increased in 31% (10/32; median, 0.36 [95% CI, 0.1-1.4]). Any increase in SPECT TTV was associated with shorter PSA PFS (hazard ratio, 4.1 [95% CI, 1.5-11.2]; P = 0.006). An increase of 30% or more in SPECT TTV was also associated with a shorter PSA PFS (hazard ratio, 3.3 [95% CI, 1.3-8.6]; P =0.02). Tumoral SUVmax was reduced in 91% (29/32) and SUVmean in 84% (27/32); neither was associated with PSA PFS or overall survival outcomes. PSA progression by week 12 was also associated with a shorter PSA PFS (hazard ratio, 26.5 [95% CI, 5.4-131]). In the patients with SPECT TTV progression at week 12, 50% (5/10) had no concurrent PSA progression (median PSA PFS, 4.5 mo [95% CI, 2.8-5.6 mo]), and 5 of 10 men had both PSA and SPECT TTV progression at week 12 (median PSA PFS, 2.8 mo [95% CI, 1.8-3.7 mo]).

Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed PCa in whom PSMA PET/CT was performed for primary staging purposes were retrospectively included. All PSMA PET/CT images were centrally overread within a high-volume PCa center, and original reports (from referring hospitals) were compared with overread reports (from the overreading hospital). To assess the interobserver variability, a Cohen κ analysis was used. To study possible differences in interobserver variability between the 3 applied PSMA radiotracers, multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. Results: In total, 584 patients with newly diagnosed PCa were included in the analysis. 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-PSMA-1007, and 68Ga-PSMA-11 were used in 205 (35.1%), 168 (28.8%), and 211 (36.1%) patients, respectively. The overall agreement (Cohen κ analysis) for locoregional lymph node metastases, distant lymph node metastases, bone metastases, and visceral metastases was 0.86, 0.86, 0.80, and 0.46, respectively. 18F-PSMA-1007 showed a significantly increased interobserver variability regarding bone metastases, compared with 18F-DCFPyL and 68Ga-PSMA-11 (P = 0.001 and 0.03, respectively). Additionally, 18F-PSMA-1007 showed a significantly increased interobserver variability regarding overall agreement and locoregional lymph node metastases, compared with 18F-DCFPyL (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Interobserver variability differs among the 3 clinically frequently used PSMA radiotracers (18F-DCFPyL, 18F-PSMA-1007, and 68Ga-PSMA-11) in patients with newly diagnosed PCa. The agreement in bone metastases is significantly worse for 18F-PSMA-1007, mainly due to nonspecific tracer uptake in osseous structures. On the basis of our findings, PSMA PET/CT scans undertaken with 18F-PSMA-1007 in primary staging should be interpreted carefully, and training on interpreting this specific PSMA radiotracer is strongly advised.""","""['Marinus J Hagens', 'Daniela E Oprea-Lager', 'André N Vis', 'Maurits Wondergem', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Dennie Meijer', 'Louise Emmett', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'How accurate is 68Gallium-prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography / computed tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET/CT) on primary lymph node staging before radical prostatectomy in intermediate and high risk prostate cancer?

Although stereotactic body RT (SBRT) is a well-studied and convenient option for definitive treatment, data on the postprostatectomy setting are extremely limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate short-term physician-scored genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities and patient-reported outcomes after postprostatectomy SBRT.  Methods and materials:   The SCIMITAR trial was a phase 2, dual-center, open-label, single-arm trial that enrolled patients with postoperative prostate-specific antigen >0.03 ng/mL or adverse pathologic features. Coprimary endpoints were 4-year biochemical recurrence-free survival, physician-scored acute and late GU and GI toxicities by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03) scale, and patient-reported quality-of-life (QOL) outcomes, as represented by the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index-26 and the International Prostate Symptom Score. Patients received SBRT 30 to 34 Gy/5 fractions to the prostate bed ± bed boost ± pelvic nodes with computed tomography (CTgRT) or magnetic resonance imaging guidance (MRgRT) in a nonrandomized fashion. Physician-scored toxicities and patient-reported QOL outcomes were collected at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months of follow-up. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate predictors of toxicities and QOL outcomes.  Results:   One hundred participants were enrolled (CTgRT, n = 69; MRgRT, n = 31). The median follow-up was 29.5 months (CTgRT: 33.3 months, MRgRT: 22.6 months). The median (range) prostate bed dose was 32 (30-34) Gy. Acute and late grade 2 GU toxicities were both 9% while acute and late grade 2 GI toxicities were 5% and 0%, respectively. Three patients had grade 3 toxicity (n = 1 GU, n = 2 GI). No patient receiving MRgRT had grade 3 GU or grade ≥2 GI toxicity. Compared with CTgRT, MRgRT was associated with a 30.5% (95% confidence interval, 11.6%-49.5%) reduction in any-grade acute GI toxicity (P = .006). MRgRT was independently associated with improved any-grade GI toxicity and improved bowel QOL.  Conclusions:   Postprostatectomy SBRT was well tolerated at short-term follow-up. MRgRT may decrease GI toxicity. Longer toxicity and/or efficacy follow-up and randomized studies are needed.""","""['Ting Martin Ma', 'Leslie K Ballas', 'Holly Wilhalme', 'Ankush Sachdeva', 'Natalie Chong', 'Sahil Sharma', 'Tiffany Yang', 'Vincent Basehart', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Christopher Saigal', 'Karim Chamie', 'Mark S Litwin', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Stephanie M Yoon', 'Lauren Smith', 'Yu Gao', 'Michael L Steinberg', 'Minsong Cao', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['A Prospective Single-Arm Phase 2 Study of Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Guided Adaptive Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Early Toxicity Results.', 'Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy to the Prostate Bed With Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT): A Phase 2 Trial.', 'Risk adapted dose-intensified postoperative radiation therapy in prostate cancer patients using a simultaneous integrated boost technique applied with helical Tomotherapy.', 'Salvage stereotactic body radiation therapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer following primary radiation therapy, are benefits worth toxicity risks?: A systematic review.', 'Acute and long-term toxicity of whole pelvis proton radiation therapy for definitive or adjuvant management of gynecologic cancers.', 'Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance-Guided Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Radiotherapy on Combination MR-Linear Accelerators: Current Practice and Future Directions.', 'Application of a genetic signature of late GU toxicity in SCIMITAR, a Post-op SBRT trial.', 'Preliminary Analysis of a Phase II Trial of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer With High-Risk Features After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Clinical Practice Evolvement for Post-Operative Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy-Part 2: Feasibility of Margin Reduction for Fractionated Radiation Treatment with Advanced Image Guidance.', 'Clinical Practice Evolvement for Post-Operative Prostate Cancer Radiotherapy-Part 1: Consistent Organs at Risk Management with Advanced Image Guidance.']"""

The co-administration of NL and DTX resulted in a significant loss of cell viability with enhanced apoptosis in DTX-sensitive/resistant prostate cancer cells. NL abrogated DTX-triggered NF-κB activation and expression of its downstream antiapoptotic factors (survivin, Bcl-2, and XIAP). The combination of NL and DTX significantly reduced the DNA binding ability of NF-κB in both cell types.

We describe a series of 9 MtF transgender patients who underwent prostate tissue sampling and highlight histopathologic features and challenges related to pathologic interpretation of prostate tissue in this patient population. Seven of 9 total patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and all had elevated prostate-specific antigen at the time of diagnosis. Three of the 7 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had received different types of hormone therapy for gender affirmation before the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and in all 3 of these patients, there was histologic evidence of hormone therapy effect in both benign prostate tissue and/or the adenocarcinoma. The 2 patients with benign prostate tissue underwent transurethral resection for lower urinary tract symptoms and were previously on hormone therapy for gender affirmation. Both of these specimens showed diffuse glandular atrophy and basal cell hyperplasia, indicative of hormone therapy effect on benign prostatic tissue. In the patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, a spectrum of grades was observed, ranging from Grade Group 1 to Grade Group 5. Four patients underwent radical prostatectomy, with 2 cases showing extraprostatic extension and Grade Group 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma, and 2 showing Grade Group 2 prostatic adenocarcinoma. Three of the 4 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had received gender-affirming hormone therapy before surgery, and all 3 of these specimens showed hormone therapy effect in non-neoplastic prostate tissue and focal hormone therapy effect in prostatic adenocarcinoma. The presence of areas of viable carcinoma without hormone therapy effect enabled the assignment of a Gleason score and Grade Group in these 3 cases. Hormone therapy administered for gender identity affirmation induces histopathologic changes to both benign prostate tissue (nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia, diffuse atrophy, basal cell hyperplasia, and stromal dominance with decreased numbers of glands) and prostatic adenocarcinoma (nuclear pyknosis, atrophy, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and architectural patterns that would qualify for Gleason 4 and 5 in the absence of hormone therapy effect) that have been traditionally seen in cis-male prostate cancer patients receiving hormone therapy. In the absence of hormone therapy, the morphology of prostatic adenocarcinoma in transgender patients shows classic morphologic features similar to those seen in cis-male patients not on hormone therapy. Prostate cancer with hormone therapy effect may not only be histologically quite subtle and may be overlooked if not suspected, but also should not be assigned a Gleason score because the Gleason score would substantially overstate its biologic potential. Therefore, similar to cis-male patients who have received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, transgender patients on hormone therapy for gender affirmation may be at risk for both underrecognition and over-grading of prostate cancer, particularly if the pathologist is not aware of the clinical history.""","""['Ezra Baraban', 'Chien-Kuang C Ding', 'Marissa White', 'Poonam Vohra', 'Jeffry Simko', 'Karen Boyle', 'Charles Guo', 'Miao Zhang', 'Adrian Dobs', 'Suvethavarshini Ketheeswaran', 'Fan Liang', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Pathologic effects of neoadjuvant cyproterone acetate on nonneoplastic prostate, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and adenocarcinoma: a detailed analysis of radical prostatectomy specimens from a randomized trial.', 'Prostatic adenocarcinoma with atrophic features: malignancy mimicking a benign process.', 'Mesonephric remnant hyperplasia involving prostate and periprostatic tissue: findings at radical prostatectomy.', 'The morphologic changes induced by hormone and radiation therapy on prostate carcinoma.', 'Pathological changes in benign and malignant prostatic tissue following androgen deprivation therapy.', ""Prostate cancer is not just a man's concern - the use of PSA screening in transgender women.""]"""

To better guide shared decision making regarding treatment, we compared patient reported outcomes through 5 years following radical prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost for localized prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   From 2011-2012, men aged <80 years with localized prostate adenocarcinoma were enrolled and followed longitudinally. Patient reported outcomes included the Expanded Prostate Index Composite. Regression models adjusted for baseline scores and covariates were constructed.  Results:   The study population included 112 men treated with external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost and 1,553 treated with radical prostatectomy. Compared to radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy with low dose rate brachytherapy boost was associated with clinically meaningful worse urinary irritative/obstructive (adjusted mean score difference [95% confidence interval]: 5.0 [-8.7, -1.3]; P = .008 at 5 years) and better urinary incontinence function (13.3 [7.7, 18.9]; P < .001 at 5 years) through 5 years.

We evaluated associations of cell-cycle progression and phosphatase and tensin homolog with metastasis-free survival in contemporary intermediate/high-risk prostate cancer patients overall, and intermediate/high-risk men receiving salvage radiotherapy.  Materials and methods:   In a case-cohort of 209 prostatectomy patients with intermediate/high-risk prostate cancer, and a cohort of 172 such men who received salvage radiotherapy, cell-cycle progression score was calculated from RNA expression, and phosphatase and tensin homolog was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Proportional hazards regression, weighted for case-cohort design or unweighted for the salvage radiotherapy cohort, was used to evaluate associations of cell-cycle progression, phosphatase and tensin homolog with metastasis-free survival. Improvement in model discrimination was evaluated with the concordance index.  Results:   In the case-cohort 41 men had metastasis, and 17 developed metastasis in the salvage radiotherapy cohort, at median follow-up of 3 and 4 years, respectively. For both case-cohort and salvage radiotherapy cohort, cell-cycle progression was independently associated with metastasis-free survival after adjustment for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical: hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) = 3.11 (1.70-5.69) and 1.85 (1.19-2.85), respectively. Adding cell-cycle progression to Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical increased the concordance index from 0.861 to 0.899 (case-cohort), and 0.745 to 0.819 (salvage radiotherapy cohort). Although statistically significant in univariate analyses, phosphatase and tensin homolog was no longer significant after adjustment for Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment Post-Surgical.

During the study period, the incidence of t-AML almost doubled with a yearly increase in t-AML of 4.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.8%-6.2%), which contributed significantly to the general increase in AML incidence over the study period. t-AML solidly constituted over 10% of all AML cases during the later period of the study. Primary diagnoses with the largest increase in incidence and decrease in mortality rate during the study period (i.e., breast and prostate cancer) contributed significantly to the increased incidence of t-AML.

The medical treatment of metastatic prostate cancer relies heavily on androgen deprivation. The present study aimed to explore the inhibitory effect of anlotinib on androgen receptor (AR)-negative prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and investigate its mechanism of action. Two prostate cancer cell lines, DU145 and PC-3, were treated with different concentrations (0-80 μM) of anlotinib. Cell proliferation was accessed by CCK-8 assay and EdU staining. Cell nuclear morphology was observed after DAPI staining, cell apoptosis level was evaluated by Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining, and western blot was used to detect the proliferation- and apoptosis-related proteins. The potential interaction between anlotinib and AKT was revealed by molecular docking. After treatment with anlotinib, the cell proliferation rate was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. The DAPI staining showed that anlotinib could induce apoptosis. Further, Annexin V/PI double staining confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis, accompanied by the increase of cleaved caspase-3 and activated PARP. Moreover, anlotinib significantly decreased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT) and its downstream pathway proteins in prostate cells (p<0.05). Experiments further confirmed that the activation of the AKT pathway reversed the inhibitory effect of anlotinib on DU145 and PC-3 cell proliferation.

MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous small RNA molecules, which are essential for the posttranscriptional regulation of genes. miR-29b is closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors, including prostate cancer, colon cancer, and breast cancer. However, few studies have been performed to explore the expression and pathway of miR-29b in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods:   Using bioinformatics analysis, we found that patients with low relative expression of the miR-29b gene have a low long-term survival rate. The results of in vitro research showed that when miR-29b expression was upregulated, the invasion, migration, and proliferation of A549 and NCI-H-1792 cells was inhibited, and the apoptosis was accelerated.  Results:   The results showed that FEM1B is a miR-29b target gene, and the expressions of FEM1B and miR-29b were negatively correlated. Like the upregulation of miR-29b expression, silencing the FEM1B expression could also impair the invasion, migration, and proliferation abilities of A549 and NCI-H-1792 cells. When FEM1B expression was restored, the inhibitory effect of miR-29b could be reversed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot (WB) analysis showed that overexpression of miR-29b could inhibit the expression of FEM1B, AKT, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and Sirt3 in A549 and NCI-H-1792 cells and upregulate the expression of FOXO1 protein.  Conclusion:   The results of this study indicate that miR-29b inhibits the proliferation and deterioration of NSCLC cells by targeting FEM1B and inhibiting the activation of the FOXO1/AKT pathway. miR-29b may become a new target for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer, and it is expected to become a new inhibitor of NSCLC.""","""['Huanrong Zhang', 'Rong Wang', 'Qiuhua Deng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Math Methods Med""","""['Effect of microRNA-135a on Cell Proliferation, Migration, Invasion, Apoptosis and Tumor Angiogenesis Through the IGF-1/PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.', 'MicroRNA-629 promotes the tumorigenesis of non-small-cell lung cancer by targeting FOXO1 and activating PI3K/AKT pathway.', 'MiroRNA-31-3p Promotes the Invasion and Metastasis of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Targeting Forkhead Box 1 (FOXO1).', ""Overview of the miR-29 family members' function in breast cancer."", 'Mir-29b in Breast Cancer: A Promising Target for Therapeutic Approaches.']"""

Design:   We conducted a retrospective population cohort study using routinely collected administrative health data sets in Victoria, Australia.  Setting/participants:   All adult cancer decedents in 2018 were identified and clinical, demographic, palliative care access and quality of end of life care indices collected.Comparisons between a historic cohort of lung, breast and prostate cancer patients who died between the years 2005 and 2009 and those with these diagnoses in the current cohort.  Results:   In 2018 there were 10,245 Victorian decedents with a cancer-coded cause of death, of these 3689 had lung, prostate or breast cancer. In 2018, access to palliative care increased (66% vs 54%) and greater numbers accessed palliative care more than 3 months before death (18% vs 10%) than in 2005-2009. Indices of end of life quality improved across most domains. However the median time between first palliative care and death was shorter in 2018 (22 vs 25 days) and more people first accessed palliative care in the hospitalisation during which they died (43% vs 33%).  Conclusion:   Despite established benefits of early palliative care, the important task of translation of this evidence into practice remains.""","""['Jennifer Philip', 'Anna Collins', 'Olivia Warwyk', 'Vijaya Sundararajan', 'Brian Le']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Palliat Med""","""['Transition Points for the Routine Integration of Palliative Care in Patients With Advanced Cancer.', 'Access to palliative care by disease trajectory: a population-based cohort of Ontario decedents.', 'Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer: a benchmark for quality end-of-life cancer care?', 'The Costs of Waiting: Implications of the Timing of Palliative Care Consultation among a Cohort of Decedents at a Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Primary care service use by end-of-life cancer patients: a nationwide population-based cohort study in the United Kingdom.', 'The feasibility of triggers for the integration of Standardised, Early Palliative (STEP) Care in advanced cancer: A phase II trial.']"""

In a sample of individuals with LPC, the purpose of this study was to (a) assess concordance between the influence of potential adverse treatment outcomes and treatment choice; (b) determine whether receipt of a decision aid predicts higher odds of concordance; and (c) identify predictors of concordance from a set of participant characteristics and influential personal factors.  Methods:   Participants reported the influence of potential adverse treatment outcomes and personal factors on treatment decisions at baseline. Preference-concordant treatment was defined as (a) any treatment if risk of adverse outcomes did not have a lot of influence, (b) active surveillance if risk of adverse outcomes had a lot of influence, or (c) radical prostatectomy or active surveillance if risk of adverse bowel outcomes had a lot of influence and risk of other adverse outcomes did not have a lot of influence. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and logistic regression.  Results:   Of 224 participants, 137 (61%) pursued treatment concordant with preferences related to adverse treatment outcomes. Receipt of a decision aid did not predict higher odds of concordance. Low tumor risk and age ≥ 60 years predicted higher odds of concordance, while attributing a lot of influence to the impact of treatment on recreation predicted lower odds of concordance.  Conclusions:   Risk of potential adverse treatment outcomes may not be the foremost consideration of some patients with LPC. Assessment of the relative importance of patients' stated values and preferences is warranted in the setting of LPC treatment decision making.  Clinical trial registration: NCT01844999 ( www.

To evaluate frozen section biopsy utilization in targeted prostate biopsy to omit systematic biopsies in cases of positive frozen section results of patients with clinical features suggestive of high-risk prostate cancer. In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled patients with a Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) 5 lesion on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with clinical evidence suggestive of high-risk prostate cancer (either an extracapsular extension or prostate-specific antigen level > 20 ng/ml). All patients underwent 2-4 core targeted biopsies utilizing frozen section biopsy with immediate results, allowing patients with a positive result to omit a systematic biopsy. In case of a negative result, additional systematic biopsies were performed. The primary endpoint was the detection rate of targeted biopsy. Patient demographics, clinical variables were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Sixty-six patients were enrolled in this study. Among them, 63 patients were diagnosed with cancer without the need for an additional systematic biopsy. Three patients were non-diagnostic with target biopsy alone. Hence an additional systematic biopsy was performed. Two of these patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and one tested negative for cancer. In this report we looked into the necessity of taking a routine systematic biopsy in patients with high risk features of prostate cancer.

Preclinical studies have demonstrated the ability of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) to sensitize tumors to T cell checkpoint blockade. Combining TRT approaches with immunotherapy may be more feasible than combining with EBRT to treat widely metastatic disease, however the effects of TRT on the prostate tumor microenvironment alone and in combinfation with checkpoint blockade have not yet been studied.  Methods:   C57BL/6 mice-bearing TRAMP-C1 tumors and FVB/NJ mice-bearing Myc-CaP tumors were treated with a single intravenous administration of either low-dose or high-dose 90Y-NM600 TRT, and with or without anti-PD-1 therapy. Groups of mice were followed for tumor growth while others were used for tissue collection and immunophenotyping of the tumors via flow cytometry.  Results: 90Y-NM600 TRT was safe at doses that elicited a moderate antitumor response. TRT had multiple effects on the tumor microenvironment including increasing CD8 +T cell infiltration, increasing checkpoint molecule expression on CD8 +T cells, and increasing PD-L1 expression on myeloid cells. However, PD-1 blockade with TRT treatment did not improve antitumor efficacy. Tregs remained functional up to 1 week following TRT, but CD8 +T cells were not, and the suppressive function of Tregs increased when anti-PD-1 was present in in vitro studies. The combination of anti-PD-1 and TRT was only effective in vivo when Tregs were depleted.  Conclusions:   Our data suggest that the combination of 90Y-NM600 TRT and PD-1 blockade therapy is ineffective in these prostate cancer models due to the activating effect of anti-PD-1 on Tregs. This finding underscores the importance of thorough understanding of the effects of TRT and immunotherapy combinations on the tumor immune microenvironment prior to clinical investigation.""","""['Hemanth K Potluri', 'Carolina A Ferreira', 'Joseph Grudzinski', 'Christopher Massey', 'Eduardo Aluicio-Sarduy', 'Jonathan W Engle', 'Ohyun Kwon', 'Ian R Marsh', 'Bryan P Bednarz', 'Reinier Hernandez', 'Jamey P Weichert', 'Douglas G McNeel']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Developments in Combining Targeted Radionuclide Therapies and Immunotherapies for Cancer Treatment.', 'Low-dose targeted radionuclide therapy renders immunologically cold tumors responsive to immune checkpoint blockade.', 'Combined VLA-4-Targeted Radionuclide Therapy and Immunotherapy in a Mouse Model of Melanoma.', 'Integrin αvβ3-targeted radionuclide therapy combined with immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy synergistically enhances anti-tumor efficacy.', 'Combining Targeted Radionuclide Therapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Cancer Treatment.', 'Fibroblast activation protein targeted radiotherapy induces an immunogenic tumor microenvironment and enhances the efficacy of PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition.', 'Targeted Radiation and Immune Therapies-Advances and Opportunities for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'Developments in Combining Targeted Radionuclide Therapies and Immunotherapies for Cancer Treatment.']"""

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. High-risk mutations were defined as pathogenic somatic mutations within ATM, BRCA1/2, Rb1, or TP53. The median follow-up for the whole group was 52.5 months. Median PFS was prolonged with MDT compared with observation (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.66; P value < .001), with the largest benefit of MDT in patients with a high-risk mutation (HR high-risk, 0.05; HR no high-risk, 0.42; P value for interaction: .12). Within the MDT cohort, the PFS was 13.4 months in those without a high-risk mutation, compared with 7.5 months in those with a high-risk mutation (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25 to 1.11; P = .09).

Materials and methods:   Of 1,467 patients with targeted biopsy+systematic biopsy, analyses were restricted to 571 patients with index lesion+secondary lesion, Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System score ≥3. Index lesion was defined as having the greatest Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System score and/or lesion volume as opposed to secondary lesion. We retrospectively compared clinically significant prostate cancer rates (ie, Gleason Grade Group ≥2) between index lesion+secondary lesion and index lesion+secondary lesion+systematic biopsy. Subgroup analyses in men with ipsilateral index lesion+secondary lesion focused on contralateral systematic biopsy. Multivariable logistic regression analyses to predict any clinically significant prostate cancer included age, previous biopsies, prostate specific antigen density, respective index lesion/secondary lesion volumes, side relation, Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System strata, and number of targeted biopsy and systematic biopsy cores.  Results:   Clinically significant prostate cancer rates for index lesion+secondary lesion vs index lesion+secondary lesion+systematic biopsy were 38% vs 42% (P = .2) at expense of significantly higher median number of biopsy cores (9 vs 25, P < .001). In the subgroup with ipsilateral index lesion+secondary lesion (n = 236), contralateral systematic biopsy detected clinically significant prostate cancer in 17%. In the narrower subgroup with ipsilateral index lesion+secondary lesion (n = 131) without any clinically significant prostate cancer, contralateral systematic biopsy detected clinically significant prostate cancer in 3.8%. Multivariable logistic regression analyses confirmed contralateral systematic biopsy as independent predictor, but performed similarly without systematic biopsy information (area under the curve 87.1% vs 86.6%).  Conclusions:   Targeted biopsy of secondary lesion should be included in targeted biopsy protocols due to added diagnostic information. However, for targeted biopsy of index lesion+secondary lesion additional systematic biopsy is of limited informative value in terms of overall clinically significant prostate cancer detection. However, when index lesion+secondary lesion are ipsilateral, contralateral systematic biopsy should be recommended for purpose of prostate lobe information.

However, this is a difficult task because of the relative lack of contrast in CBCT images, leading to high inter-observer variability. Deformable image registration (DIR) and deep-learning based automatic segmentation approaches have shown interesting results for this task in the past years. However, they are either sensitive to large organ deformations, or require to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) from a database of delineated CBCT images, which is difficult to do without improvement of image quality. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: to train a CNN (using a deep learning-based segmentation tool called nnU-Net) from a database of artificial CBCT images simulated from planning CT, for which it is easier to obtain the organ contours.  Methods:   Pseudo-CBCT (pCBCT) images were simulated from readily available segmented planning CT images, using the GATE Monte Carlo simulation. CT reference delineations were copied onto the pCBCT, resulting in a database of segmented images used to train the neural network. The studied segmentation contours were: bladder, rectum, and prostate contours. We trained multiple nnU-Net models using different training: (1) segmented real CBCT, (2) pCBCT, (3) segmented real CT and tested on pseudo-CT (pCT) generated from CBCT with cycleGAN, and (4) a combination of (2) and (3). The evaluation was performed on different datasets of segmented CBCT or pCT by comparing predicted segmentations with reference ones thanks to Dice similarity score and Hausdorff distance. A qualitative evaluation was also performed to compare DIR-based and nnU-Net-based segmentations.  Results:   Training with pCBCT was found to lead to comparable results to using real CBCT images. When evaluated on CBCT obtained from the same hospital as the CT images used in the simulation of the pCBCT, the model trained with pCBCT scored mean DSCs of 0.92 ± 0.05, 0.87 ± 0.02, and 0.85 ± 0.04 and mean Hausdorff distance 4.67 ± 3.01, 3.91 ± 0.98, and 5.00 ± 1.32 for the bladder, rectum, and prostate contours respectively, while the model trained with real CBCT scored mean DSCs of 0.91 ± 0.06, 0.83 ± 0.07, and 0.81 ± 0.05 and mean Hausdorff distance 5.62 ± 3.24, 6.43 ± 5.11, and 6.19 ± 1.14 for the bladder, rectum, and prostate contours, respectively. It was also found to outperform models using pCT or a combination of both, except for the prostate contour when tested on a dataset from a different hospital. Moreover, the resulting segmentations demonstrated a clinical acceptability, where 78% of bladder segmentations, 98% of rectum segmentations, and 93% of prostate segmentations required minor or no corrections, and for 76% of the patients, all structures of the patient required minor or no corrections.  Conclusion:   We proposed to use simulated CBCT images to train a nnU-Net segmentation model, avoiding the need to gather complex and time-consuming reference delineations on CBCT images.""","""['Nelly Abbani', 'Thomas Baudier', 'Simon Rit', 'Francesca di Franco', 'Franklin Okoli', 'Vincent Jaouen', 'Florian Tilquin', 'Anaïs Barateau', 'Antoine Simon', 'Renaud de Crevoisier', 'Julien Bert', 'David Sarrut']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Deep learning based direct segmentation assisted by deformable image registration for cone-beam CT based auto-segmentation for adaptive radiotherapy.', 'Deep-learning-based image registration and automatic segmentation of organs-at-risk in cone-beam CT scans from high-dose radiation treatment of pancreatic cancer.', 'Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Deep learning for segmentation in radiation therapy planning: a review.', 'Tooth automatic segmentation from CBCT images: a systematic review.', 'Machine learning-based multimodal MRI texture analysis for assessing renal function and fibrosis in diabetic nephropathy: a retrospective study.', 'Anatomical evaluation of deep-learning synthetic computed tomography images generated from male pelvis cone-beam computed tomography.']"""

This study evaluated the long-term efficacy of a postoperative IH prevention technique that uses no artificial agents to assess the characteristics of IH occurrence after introducing this technique.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed 201 consecutive patients who underwent RARP at our institution between September 2011 and February 2014. In total, 189 cases were eligible for the study. The non-IH prevention and IH prevention groups comprised 72 and 117 cases, respectively. We compared the incidence of IH between the two groups using Kaplan-Meier curves. Risk factors for IH in the prevention group were determined via multivariable logistic regression analysis.  Results:   The rate of IH occurrence was 20.8% (15 cases) in the nonprevention group and 8.5% (10 cases) in the prevention group, with median follow-up periods of 99.5 and 89.9 months, respectively. The Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.011). Only cutting of the vas deferens significantly contributed to reduced occurrence of IH in multivariable analysis (p = 0.047). After reviewing the intraoperative videos, insufficient separation of the vas deferens was considered the main cause of IH in the prevention group.  Conclusion:   Our simple prevention technique with no artificial agents had a durable effect on IH prevention after RARP over a median follow-up period of more than 7 years.

As volume estimation using biopsy ultrasound (Bx-US) alone may be inaccurate, many centers perform additional volume assessments prior to the brachytherapy procedure. At the study institution, computed tomography (CT) based volume assessments were routinely performed on all patients to determine brachytherapy eligibility. This study aimed to determine whether this CT imaging could be omitted for certain Bx-US based gland volume estimates. To investigate this, 1576 consecutive patients that received ultrasound based intraoperatively planned brachytherapy at a single comprehensive cancer center between 2003 and 2021 were reviewed. Gland volume as estimated by Bx-US, CT and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were compared to intraoperatively contoured gland volume (ICGV) or the larger contoured gland volume on CT for any patients receiving neo-adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for gland downsizing (IM-US-corr). There was a significant difference between IM-US-corr and estimated gland volume for Bx-US (P < 0.001) and MR (P < 0.001), but not CT (P = 0.160). Bx-US and MR tended to underrepresent the IM-US-corr, with a > 20% difference from actual volume in 31% and 59% of cases, respectively. When Bx-US volume was estimated to be < 40 cc, < 50 cc and < 60 cc, an IM-US-corr > 60 cc was encountered in 2%, 5% and 7% of cases, respectively. In contrast, IM-US-corr > 60 cc was encountered in 0.2%, 1% and 2% of cases for CT estimates of < 40 cc, < 50 cc and < 60 cc. In patients with an estimated gland volume of < 50 cc by Bx-US, dedicated pre-operative volume studies are unlikely to alter management.

At dose of 0.8 mg/kg (∼250 nmol/kg), the two SMDCs showed significant efficacy in a PSMA(+) PC3-PIP mouse model of human prostate cancer compared with controls, without inducing systemic toxicity. Though localization of the SMDCs was observed in tissues apart from the tumor, release of MMAE was observed predominantly in tumor tissue, at levels that were 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than non-target tissues. Furthermore, SMDC2, which incorporated a novel pH-responsive phosporamidate linker, demonstrated significantly improved efficacy over SMDC1 that has a Val-Cit linker, with a 100% survival over 90 days and 4 out of 8 mice showing complete tumor growth inhibition after 6 weekly doses of 0.8 mg/kg (244 nmol/kg).

In this study, we analyzed the effects of novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) and bromodomain and extraterminal domain-containing (BET) inhibitors to combine them into a potent HDAC-BET-fusion molecule and to understand their molecular mode-of-action. Treatment of (cisplatin-resistant) germ cell tumors (GCT), urothelial, renal, and prostate carcinoma cells with the HDAC, BET, and dual inhibitors decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis, and affected the cell cycle. Furthermore, a dual inhibitor considerably decreased tumor burden in GCT xenograft models. On a molecular level, correlating RNA- to ATAC-sequencing data indicated a considerable induction of gene expression, accompanied by site-specific changes of chromatin accessibility after HDAC inhibitor application. Upregulated genes could be linked to intra- and extra-cellular trafficking, cellular organization, and neuronal processes, including neuroendocrine differentiation. Regarding chromatin accessibility on a global level, an equal distribution of active or repressed DNA accessibility has been detected after HDAC inhibitor treatment, questioning the current understanding of HDAC inhibitor function.

AMACR is a useful diagnostic biomarker for prostate carcinomas and several other malignancies. Its expression in apocrine breast lesions had been previously reported, but its role in breast cancer progression has not been fully investigated. One hundred fifty breast samples (80 with invasive carcinomas) were studied. The expression of AMACR protein was analyzed using the immunohistochemical method (IHC). Lesions were considered positive if AMACR was detected in ≥10% of the cells at any intensity comprising a histologically defined normal epithelial structure or a pathologic lesion. In addition, AMACR mRNA relative expression was calculated from the whole-transcript RNA-Seq performed on >20,000 diverse tumor samples using a 20,000+ hybrid-capture NGS assay with the transcript capture panel based on the Agilent SureSelect Human All ExonV7. Expression of AMACR protein was restricted to epithelia. It was uncommon in the normal breast (7/81 samples, 9%). Increasing AMACR expression was observed with proliferative epithelial lesions (18% of usual ductal hyperplasias/adenosis, 70% of atypical lesions and 72% of DCIS/LCIS). Invasive ductal carcinomas NST and invasive lobular carcinomas expressed AMACR in 64% and 46%, respectively. The highest AMACR expression was observed in luminal B and HER2-positive breast carcinomas (86-100%). Triple-negative breast carcinomas exhibited AMACR in 50% of the cases. Apocrine lesions showed strong, nearly uniform overexpression of AMACR (100% of metaplasias, hyperplasias and in situ carcinomas and 88% of invasive apocrine carcinomas were positive). RNA-Seq analysis also confirmed AMACR expression in breast carcinomas, although its median value was substantially lower with a lower standard deviation than in prostate carcinomas. Over-expression of AMACR characterizes various proliferative, preinvasive and invasive breast lesions and is not specific to the apocrine morphology. It points to altered lipid metabolism (branched fatty acids) as one of the general characteristics of breast carcinogenesis, like several other malignancies. Its early detection may represent a potential target for cancer progression intervention.""","""['Zoran Gatalica', 'Phillip Stafford', 'Semir Vranic']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Hum Pathol""","""['α-Methylacyl-CoA racemase: a useful immunohistochemical marker of breast carcinoma with apocrine differentiation.', 'AMACR Expression is a Potential Diagnostic Marker in Apocrine Lesions of Breast, and is Associated with High Histologic Grade and Lymph Node Metastases in Some Invasive Apocrine Breast Cancers.', 'Expression of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (P504s) in various malignant neoplasms and normal tissues: astudy of 761 cases.', 'Discovery and clinical application of a novel prostate cancer marker: alpha-methylacyl CoA racemase (P504S).', 'Application of alpha-methylacyl coenzyme A racemase immunohistochemistry in the diagnosis of prostate cancer: a review.']"""

It is unknown how spending differs between the 2 programs after accounting for differences in patient clinical risk.  Objective:   To examine how spending and utilization differ between MA and MSSP beneficiaries after accounting for differences in clinical risk using data from administrative claims and electronic health records.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective economic evaluation used data from 15 763 propensity score-matched beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in MA or MSSP from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2018, with diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic kidney disease (CKD), or hypertension. Participants received care at a large nonprofit academic health system in the southern United States that bears risk for Medicare beneficiaries through both the MA and MSSP programs. Differences in beneficiary risk were mitigated by propensity score matching using validated clinical criteria based on data from administrative claims and electronic health records. Data were analyzed from January 2019 to May 2022.  Exposures:   Enrollment in MA or attribution to an accountable care organization in the MSSP program.  Main outcomes and measures:   Per-beneficiary annual total spending and subcomponents, including inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, skilled nursing facility, emergency department, primary care, and specialist spending.  Results:   The sample of 15 763 participants included 12 720 (81%) MA and 3043 (19%) MSSP beneficiaries. MA beneficiaries, compared with MSSP beneficiaries, were more likely to be older (median [IQR] age, 75.0 [69.9-81.8] years vs 73.1 [68.3-79.8] years), male (5515 [43%] vs 1119 [37%]), and White (9644 [76%] vs 2046 [69%]) and less likely to live in low-income zip codes (2338 [19%] vs 750 [25%]). The mean unadjusted per-member per-year spending difference between MSSP and MA disease-specific subcohorts was $2159 in diabetes, $4074 in CHF, $2560 in CKD, and $2330 in hypertension. After matching on clinical risk and demographic factors, MSSP spending was higher for patients with diabetes (mean per-member per-year spending difference in 2015: $2454; 95% CI, $1431-$3574), CHF ($3699; 95% CI, $1235-$6523), CKD ($2478; 95% CI, $1172-$3920), and hypertension ($2258; 95% CI, $1616-2,939). Higher MSSP spending among matched beneficiaries was consistent over time. In the matched cohort in 2018, MSSP total spending ranged from 23% (CHF) to 30% (CKD) higher than MA. Adjusting for differential trends in coding intensity did not affect these results. Higher outpatient hospital spending among MSSP beneficiaries contributed most to spending differences between MSSP and MA, representing 49% to 62% of spending differences across disease cohorts.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this study, utilization and spending were consistently higher for MSSP than MA beneficiaries within the same health system even after adjusting for granular metrics of clinical risk. Nonclinical factors likely contribute to the large differences in MA vs MSSP spending, which may create challenges for health systems participating in MSSP relative to their participation in MA.""","""['Ravi B Parikh', 'Ezekiel J Emanuel', 'Colleen M Brensinger', 'Connor W Boyle', 'Eboni G Price-Haywood', 'Jeffrey H Burton', 'Sabrina B Heltz', 'Amol S Navathe']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Comparing Spending in Medicare Advantage and Accountable Care Organizations-Is Plan-Health Care System Integration the Future?', 'Changes in Postacute Care in the Medicare Shared Savings Program.', 'Health Care Utilization and Spending in Medicare Advantage vs Traditional Medicare: A Difference-in-Differences Analysis.', 'Association of Primary Care Engagement in Value-Based Reform Programs With Health Services Outcomes: Participation and Synergies.', 'Association of Changes in Medication Use and Adherence With Accountable Care Organization Exposure in Patients With Cardiovascular Disease or Diabetes.', 'Medicare Advantage Chart Reviews Are Associated With Billions in Additional Payments for Some Plans.']"""

Although we also observed its cytocidal activity against PC-3 and DU145 androgen receptor (AR)-negative and P53-null/mutant aggressive human prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines in NCI-60 screen, the potential involvement and targeting of AR and P53 pathways that are intact in early-stage prostate carcinogenesis has not been examined, nor its primary molecular signaling after exposure.  Methods:   Human LNCaP PCa cells with functional AR and intact P53 were used to examine their cell cycle and cell fate responses to AS-10 exposure and upstream molecular signaling events including histone acetylation as a known aspirin effect. The AR-positive 22Rv1 human PCa cells were used to validate key findings.  Results:   In addition to confirming AS-10's superior cytocidal potency than aspirin against all four PCa cell lines, we report a rapid (within 5 min) promotion of histone acetylation several hours ahead of the suppression of AR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA, coded by KLK3 gene) in LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. AS-10 decreased AR and KLK3 mRNA levels without impacting pre-existing AR protein degradation or nuclear translocation in LNCaP cells. Sustained exposure to AS-10 arrested cells predominantly in G1 , and induced caspase-mediated apoptosis without necrosis. The death induced by AS-10 in LNCaP cells was attenuated by nontranscriptional activation of P53 protein or Jun N-terminal Kinase cellular stress signaling and was mitigated modestly by glutathione-boosting antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. AS-10 synergized with histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA to suppress AR/PSA abundance and kill LNCaP cells.

However, the results are inconsistent, and whether the relationship has a causal effect remains unknown.  Methods:   We searched the PubMed and Embase libraries up to March 2021 and selected observational studies reporting the relationship between birth weight and adult-onset cancer risk. Dose-response meta-analysis and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis were used to estimate the effect.  Result:   In our dose-response meta-analysis, six cancers from 46 studies were found to have significant associations with birth weight. (Ovarian cancer: RR: 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.44; breast cancer: RR: 1.12, 95% CI 1.08-1.16; colorectal cancer: RR: 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.43; endometrial cancer: RR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.78-0.93; prostate cancer: RR: 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.61; testicular cancer: RR: 1.21, 95% CI 1.03-1.43). As birth weight increased, the slope of the dose-response curve of breast cancer increased continuously, and the curve of testicular cancer was U-shaped. In the MR study, seven cancers were included. Only invasive mucinous ovarian cancer was found to have a causal effect on birth weight (OR: 0.62; 95% CI 0.39-0.97), while other cancers did not.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that birth weight are unlikely to have a casual effect on risk of cancers via the MR analysis, although the dose-response meta-analysis shows that there is a nonlinear relationship between birth weight and breast cancer and testicular cancer.

In this study, we proposed an applicable strategy to increase the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibit glutathione (GSH), in an effort to amplify oxidative damage in prostate cancer cells. Specifically, we developed dual-responsive supramolecular self-assembled nanoparticles (NPs) based on polymerized methacrylic acid (MA) and polymerized poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl acrylate-modified β-cyclodextrin (CD) with ferrocene (Fc)-connected (S) (+)-camptothecin (CPT) (designated as MA-CD/Fc-CPT NPs). The as-prepared negatively charged supramolecular NPs can be taken up by tumor cells successfully owing to their reversible negative-to-positive charge transition capacity at acidic pH. The supramolecular NPs increased ROS generation and decreased GSH to amplify oxidative stress and improve the therapeutic effect of chemotherapy. As expected, MA-CD/Fc-CPT NPs displayed good drug delivery capabilities to tumor cells or tissues. MA-CD/Fc-CPT NPs also inhibited cancer cell proliferation in both the cells and tissues. This result was partially due to increased ROS generation and decreased GSH, which contributed to more pronounced oxidative stress.

The novelty of this report is to present elective nodal radiotherapy (ENRT) with simultaneous integrated boost with stereotactic (SBRT) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (HoFRT) for tolerance and for bRFS which we compared with SBRT of the involved field (IF) only.  Materials and methods:   Patients between 2018 and 2021 with and oligometastatic prostate cancer treated with SBRT or hypofractionation were eligible.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have evolved as regulators of many cellular signaling pathways in prostate cancer (PC). However, the role of ROS signaling in the anticancer activity of glabridin has not been investigated. Here, we attempted to evaluate the effect of glabridin on PC and the involvement of ROS signaling. Intracellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS (mitoROS) production in PC cell lines, DU-145 and LNCaP, were measured by H2DCFDA and MitoSOX Red staining, respectively. MTT assay was used to analyze the cellular viability. EdU staining assay was conducted to analyze the cell proliferation. To analyze apoptotic rate, TUNEL assay was performed. Caspase-3 activity was detected to reflect cell apoptosis. Western blot was carried out to detect the expression levels of Akt and p-Akt. We found that intracellular ROS and mitoROS levels were dose-dependently upregulated after glabridin treatment in both DU-145 and LNCaP cells, which was reversed by the treatment of ROS inhibitor, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Glabridin inhibited the cell viability and reduced the number of EdU-positive DU-145 and LNCaP cells, which were respectively proved by MTT assay and EdU staining assay. Glabridin promoted cell death with increased apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity in DU-145 and LNCaP cells. The effects of glabridin on cell proliferation and apoptosis were reversed by NAC. Moreover, glabridin suppressed the ratio of p-Akt/Akt, while NAC mitigated the decreased p-Akt/Akt ratio. In addition, the effects of glabridin on cell proliferation and apoptosis were also attenuated by Akt activator, SC79. Collectively, our results demonstrated that glabridin suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in PC cells via regulating ROS-mediated PI3K/Akt pathway.

The objective of this study was to compare the mean per-patient costs of all-cause adverse events (AEs) requiring hospitalization between darolutamide versus apalutamide and enzalutamide for nmCRPC in the USA.  Methods:   All-cause grade ≥ 3 AEs with corresponding any-grade AEs reported among at least 10% of patients in any arm of the ARAMIS (darolutamide), SPARTAN (apalutamide), and PROSPER (enzalutamide) trials were selected for inclusion in the primary analyses. After matching-adjusted indirect comparison, AE costs were calculated by multiplying the AE rates from the trials by their respective unit costs of hospitalization taken from the US Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) database. Sensitivity analyses which further included any-grade AEs reported among at least 5% of patients were also performed.  Results:   After reweighting and adjusting for the trials' placebo arms, the mean per-patient AE costs were $1021 and $387 lower for darolutamide than for apalutamide and enzalutamide, respectively, over the trials' duration (SPARTAN and PROSPER, 43 months; ARAMIS, 48 months). For darolutamide vs. apalutamide, the largest drivers of the per-patient cost differences were fracture (adjusted difference $416), hypertension ($143), and rash ($219); for darolutamide vs. enzalutamide, they were fatigue not including asthenia ($290) and hypertension including increased blood pressure (i.e., any AE of hypertension or with elevated blood pressure not yet classified as hypertension) ($60). The results of the sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary results.

This study quantified crude probabilities of deaths from cancer and other causes and estimated the number of avoidable deaths for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders if these survival disparities were removed.  Methods:   Flexible parametric relative survival models were used to estimate reported measures for a population-based cohort of 709,239 Australians (12,830 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples), 2005-2016.  Results:   Among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, the 5-year crude probability of cancer death was 0.44, while it was 0.07 for other causes of death. These probabilities were 0.07 and 0.03 higher than among other Australians, respectively. Magnitude of these disparities varied by cancer type and ranged for cancer deaths from <0.05 for pancreatic, prostate and uterine cancers to 0.20 for cervical and head and neck cancers. Values for disparity in other causes of death were generally lower. Among an average cohort of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples diagnosed per year over the most recent five-year diagnosis period (2012-2016, n = 1,269), approximately 133 deaths within 5 years of diagnosis were potentially avoidable if they had the same overall survival as other Australians, with 94 of these deaths due to cancer. The total number of avoided deaths over the entire study period (2005-2016) was 1,348, with 947 of these deaths due to cancer.  Conclusions:   Study findings suggest the need to reduce the prevalence of risk factors prevalence, increase screening participation, and improve early detection, diagnosis and treatment rates to achieve more equitable outcomes for a range of cancer types.

Therefore, in the given study, citrate mediated synthesized gold nanoparticles (CtGNPs) with immobilized survivin antibodies (SvGNPs) were bioconjugated to the substantially potent drug abiraterone (AbSvGNPs) to develop as a combinatorial therapeutic against prostate cancer. The AbSvGNPs are made up of CtGNPs, survivin antibodies, and abiraterone. The selected drug abiraterone (Abira) possesses exceptionally good activity against prostate cancer, but cancer cells develop resistance against this drug and it also poses several severe side effects. Meanwhile, survivin antibodies were used to deliver AbSvGNPs specifically into cancer cells by considering survivin, an anti-apoptotic overexpressed protein in cancer cells, as a marker. The survivin antibodies have also been used to inhibit cancer cells as an immunotherapeutic agent. Similarly, CtGNPs were discovered to inhibit cancer cell proliferation via several transduction pathways. The given bioconjugated nanoparticles (AbSvGNPs) were found to be substantially effective against prostate cancer with an IC50 of 11.8 and 7.3 μM against DU145 and PC-3 cells, respectively.

Methods:   On the online survey platform SurveyMonkey, we designed 10 survey questions to measure changes in various aspects of medical physics practice. The questions covered patient load and travel rules; scopes to work from home; new protocols to reduce corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection risk; availability of telemedicine; and changes in fractionation schedules and/or type of treatment plans. We emailed the survey to radiation oncology centers throughout Northern and Southern California, requesting one completed survey per center. All responses were anonymized, and data were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative research methods.  Results:   At the end of a 4-month collection period (July 2, 2021 to October 11, 2021), we received a total of 61 responses throughout Southern and Northern California. On average, 4111 patients were treated per day across the 61 centers. New COVID-19-related department and hospital policies, along with hybrid workflow changes, infectious control policies, and changes in patient load have been reported. Results also showed changes in treatment methods during the pandemic, such as increased use of telemedicine, hypofractionation for palliative, breast cancer, and prostate cancer cases; and simultaneous boosts, compared to sequential boosts.  Conclusion:   Our California radiation oncology center population study shows changes in various aspects of radiation oncology practices during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In this study, we aimed to discover the clinical significance and translational relevance in prostate cancer (PCa). We retrospectively analyzed 759 PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy from Huashan Hospital, Fudan University (training cohort, n = 369) and Chinese Prostate Cancer Consortium (validation cohort, n = 390). A total of 325 PCa patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (external cohort) were analyzed for exploration. Immune landscape and antitumor immunity were assessed through immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Patient-derived explant culture system was applied for evaluating the targeting potential of MDK. We found that intratumoral MDK expression correlated with PCa progression, which indicated an unfavorable biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival for postoperative PCa patients. Addition of MDK expression to the postoperative risk assessment tool CAPRA-S could improve its prognostic value. Tumors with MDK abundance characterized the tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells with less cytotoxicity production and increased immune checkpoint expression, which were accompanied by enriched immunosuppressive contexture. Moreover, MDK inhibition could reactivate CD8+ T cell antitumor immunity. MDK mRNA expression negatively correlated with androgen receptor activity signature and positively associated with radiotherapy-related signature. In conclusion, intratumoral MDK expression could serve as an independent prognosticator for BCR in postoperative PCa patients. MDK expression impaired the antitumor function of CD8+ T cells through orchestrating an immunoevasive microenvironment, which could be reversed by MDK inhibition. Moreover, tumors with MDK enrichment possessed potential sensitivity to postoperative radiotherapy while resistance to adjuvant hormonal therapy of PCa. MDK could be considered as a potential therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Quan Zhou', 'Chen Yang', 'Zezhong Mou', 'Siqi Wu', 'Xiyu Dai', 'Xinan Chen', 'Yuxi Ou', 'Limin Zhang', 'Jianjun Sha', 'Haowen Jiang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Sci""","""['Role of Midkine in Cancer Drug Resistance: Regulators of Its Expression and Its Molecular Targeting.', 'Intratumoral CXCL13+CD8+T cell infiltration determines poor clinical outcomes and immunoevasive contexture in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Prevalence of tumour-infiltrating CD103+ cells identifies therapeutic-sensitive prostate cancer with poor clinical outcome.', 'Intratumoral TIGIT+ CD8+ T-cell infiltration determines poor prognosis and immune evasion in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.', 'Shedding more light on the role of Midkine in hepatocellular carcinoma: New perspectives on diagnosis and therapy.', 'Role of Midkine in Cancer Drug Resistance: Regulators of Its Expression and Its Molecular Targeting.', 'Cryoablation inhibits the recurrence and progression of bladder cancer by enhancing tumour-specific immunity.']"""

This study aimed to compare the predictive power of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET radiomics features at different thresholds for predicting multiple biological characteristics.  Methods:   One hundred and seventy-three PCa patients with complete preoperative 18F-PSMA-1007 PET examination and clinical data before surgery were collected. The prostate lesions' volumes of interest were semi-automatically sketched with thresholds of 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). The radiomics features were respectively extracted. The prediction models of Gleason score (GS), extracapsular extension (ECE), and vascular invasion (VI) were established using the support vector machine. The performance of models from different thresholding regions was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and confusion matrix-derived indexes.  Results:   For predicting GS, the 50% SUVmax model showed the best predictive performance in training (AUC, 0.82 [95%CI 0.74-0.88]) and testing cohorts (AUC, 0.80 [95%CI 0.66-0.90]).

The ideal method for post-TULSA bladder drainage through postoperative suprapubic tube (SPT) vs indwelling urethral catheter (UC) has not been established. The objective of this study was to evaluate urinary outcomes after whole-gland TULSA, comparing postoperative SPT with UC. Materials and Methods: Two-institution retrospective analysis of whole-gland TULSA for men with grade group 1 and 2 prostate cancer. One institution placed SPT at the time of TULSA with clamp trials (day 10) and removal once voiding. The second placed UC until void trial (day 7). Outcomes included the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), urinary bother score, catheter reinsertion, stricture, clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), and incontinence. Results: Forty-five patients (median age 67) were analyzed. The UC cohort (N = 26) was older (p = 0.007) than the SPT cohort (N = 19) but with similar baseline prostate volumes, IPSS, and urinary bother scores. Patients receiving UC had fewer days with catheter (p = 0.013). Although UC patients suffered more lower urinary tract symptoms at 1-month post-TULSA, there was no significant difference between IPSS scores at baseline and 6 months after surgery regardless of urinary management strategy, although the UC group noted significantly decreased urinary bother. Rates of infection were similar between groups. Six strictures were observed overall, with more in the SPT group, although the difference was not significant (4/19 [21.1%] SPT; 2/26 [7.7%] UC). At 6 months, incontinence rates were low and similar between groups (2/19 [10.5%] SPT; 4/26 [15.4%] UC) and only one patient (UC) required CIC.

To further optimize the clinically established radiopharmaceutical PSMA-617, novel PSMA ligands for prostate cancer endoradiotherapy were developed. A series of PSMA binding tracers that comprise a benzyl group at the chelator moiety were obtained by solid-phase synthesis. The compounds were labeled with 68Ga or 177Lu. Competitive cell-binding assays and internalization assays were performed using the cell line C4-2, a subline of the PSMA positive cell line LNCaP (human lymph node carcinoma of the prostate). Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in a C4-2 tumor bearing BALB/c nu/nu mouse model. All 68Ga-labeled ligands were stable in human serum over 2 h; 177Lu-CA030 was stable over 72 h. The PSMA ligands revealed inhibition potencies [Ki] (equilibrium inhibition constants) between 4.8 and 33.8 nM. The percentage of internalization of the injected activity/106 cells of 68Ga-CA028, 68Ga-CA029, and 68Ga-CA030 was 41.2 ± 2.7, 44.3 ± 3.9, and 53.8 ± 5.4, respectively; for the comparator 68Ga-PSMA-617, 15.5 ± 3.1 was determined. Small animal PET imaging of the compounds showed a high tumor-to-background contrast. Organ distribution studies revealed high specific uptake in the tumor, that is, approximately 34.4 ± 9.8% of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 1 h post injection for 68Ga-CA028. At 1 h p.i., 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 demonstrated lower kidney uptake than 68Ga-PSMA-617, but at later time points, kidney time-activity curves converge. In line with the preclinical data, first diagnostic PET imaging using 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga-CA030 revealed high-contrast detection of bone and lymph node lesions in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. The novel PSMA ligands, in particular CA028 and CA030, are promising agents for targeting PSMA-positive tumor lesions as shown in the preclinical evaluation and in a first patient, respectively. Thus, clinical translation of 68Ga-CA028 and 68Ga/177Lu-CA030 for diagnostics and endoradiotherapy of prostate cancer in larger cohorts of patients is warranted.""","""['José Carlos Dos Santos', 'Martin Schäfer', 'Ulrike Bauder-Wüst', 'Barbro Beijer', 'Matthias Eder', 'Karin Leotta', 'Christian Kleist', 'Jan-Philip Meyer', 'Thomas R Dilling', 'Jason S Lewis', 'Clemens Kratochwil', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Walter Mier']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Chem""","""['Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Tailor-Made DOTA-Conjugated PSMA Inhibitor with Optimized Linker Moiety for Imaging and Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga- and 177Lu-Labeled PSMA I&T: Optimization of a PSMA-Targeted Theranostic Concept and First Proof-of-Concept Human Studies.', 'Comparison of 68Ga-labeled Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Ligand Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography for Primary Staging of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

In this work, we describe, for the first time, the synthesis of novel arsono-containing lipids where the alkyl groups are connected through stable ether bonds. It is expected that this class of arsonolipids, compared with the corresponding ester linked, will have higher chemical stability. To accomplish this task, a new methodology of general application was developed, where a small arsono compound, 2-hydroxyethylarsonic acid, when protected with thiophenol, can be used in an efficient and simple way as a building block for the synthesis of arsono-containing lipids as well as other arsono-containing biomolecules. Thus, besides the above-mentioned arsonolipid, an arsono cholesterol derivative was also obtained. Both ether arsonolipid and arsono cholesterol were able to form liposomes having similar physicochemical properties and integrity to conventional arsonoliposomes. Furthermore, a preliminary in vitro anticancer potential assessment of the novel ether arsonolipid containing liposomes against human prostate cancer (PC-3) and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells showed significant activity (dose- and time-dependent), which was similar to that of the conventional arsonoliposomes (studied before).

Sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate derived from 4-methylsulphinylbutyl glucosinolate (glucoraphanin) that accumulates in certain of these vegetables, notably broccoli, has been implicated in their protective effects. Likewise, the consumption of garlic and its sulphur-containing compounds such as alliin have been associated with a reduction in risk of prostate cancer. In this study, we tested whether consuming glucoraphanin derived from broccoli seeds and alliin derived from garlic resulted in the occurrence of these potential bioactive compounds in the prostate, which may contribute to our understanding of the putative protective effects of these dietary components. We recruited 42 men scheduled for a trans-perineal prostate biopsy into a randomised, double-blinded, 2 × 2-factorial dietary supplement four-week intervention study, and 39 completed the study. The two active interventions were supplements providing glucoraphanin from broccoli (BroccoMax®) and alliin from garlic (Kwai Heartcare®). Following the intervention, prostate biopsy tissue was analysed for the presence of sulforaphane and its thiol conjugates and for alliin and associated metabolites. Sulforaphane occurred in significantly higher levels in the prostate tissue (both within the transition and peripheral zone) of men consuming the glucoraphanin containing supplements (p < 0.0001) compared to men not consuming these supplements. However, while alliin and alliin-derived metabolites were detected within the prostate, there was no significant difference in the concentrations of these compounds in the prostate of men consuming supplements derived from garlic compared to men not consuming these supplements.""","""['Tracey L Livingstone', 'Shikha Saha', 'Federico Bernuzzi', 'George M Savva', 'Perla Troncoso-Rey', 'Maria H Traka', 'Robert D Mills', 'Richard Y Ball', 'Richard F Mithen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nutrients""","""['Transcriptional changes in prostate of men on active surveillance after a 12-mo glucoraphanin-rich broccoli intervention-results from the Effect of Sulforaphane on prostate CAncer PrEvention (ESCAPE) randomized controlled trial.', 'Accumulation of Dietary S-Methyl Cysteine Sulfoxide in Human Prostate Tissue.', 'Bioavailability of Glucoraphanin and Sulforaphane from High-Glucoraphanin Broccoli.', 'Novel concepts of broccoli sulforaphanes and disease: induction of phase II antioxidant and detoxification enzymes by enhanced-glucoraphanin broccoli.', 'Isothiocyanate from Broccoli, Sulforaphane, and Its Properties.', 'Sulforaphane and Its Protective Role in Prostate Cancer: A Mechanistic Approach.', 'Apoptotic Potential of Glucomoringin Isothiocyanate (GMG-ITC) Isolated from Moringa oleifera Lam Seeds on Human Prostate Cancer Cells (PC-3).']"""

Prognosis can be affected by many clinical and pathological characteristics. Our aim was to study whether bilateral SVI (bi-SVI) is associated with worse oncological outcomes. Materials and Methods: This is an observational retrospective study that included 146 pT3b patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). We compared the results between unilateral SVI (uni-SVI) and bi-SVI. The log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and additional treatment-free survival. Cox proportional hazard models were used to identify predictors of BCR-free survival, MFS, and additional treatment-free survival. Results: 34.93% of patients had bi-SVI. The median follow-up was 46.84 months. No significant differences were seen between the uni-SVI and bi-SVI groups. BCR-free survival at 5 years was 33.31% and 25.65% (p = 0.44) for uni-SVI and bi-SVI. MFS at 5 years was 86.03% vs. 75.63% (p = 0.1), and additional treatment-free survival was 36.85% vs. 21.93% (p = 0.09), respectively. In the multivariate analysis, PSA was related to the development of BCR [HR 1.34 (95%CI: 1.01-1.77); p = 0.03] and metastasis [HR 1.83 (95%CI: 1.13-2.98); p = 0.02]. BCR was also influenced by lymph node infiltration [HR 2.74 (95%CI: 1.41-5.32); p = 0.003]. Additional treatment was performed more frequently in patients with positive margins [HR: 3.50 (95%CI: 1.65-7.44); p = 0.001].

The antimicrobial and anticancer activities of P. rubens were more effective than those of A. niger and A. alternata; therefore, its identification was confirmed via the ITS rRNA gene. Filtrate extracts of P. rubens, A. alternata and A. niger were analyzed using GC-MS and showed different detected constituents, such as acetic acid ethyl ester, N-(4,6-Dimethyl-2-pyrimidinyl)-4-(4-nitrobenzylideneamino) benzenesulfonamide, 1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid, hexadecanoic acid and octadecanoic acid. Filtrate extract of P. rubens exhibited the presence of more compounds than A. alternata and A. niger.

Method:   Lung cancer (A549) and prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate NLRP3 transcription. Cells were then treated with azithromycin (Az) or ceftriaxone (Cf). NLRP3 activation was analyzed by qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA. Cell growth and viability were assessed by real-time cell analysis and Annexin V expression. Levels of 41 cytokines were also analyzed using a multiplex assay.  Results:   LPS-Az activated transcription of NLRP3, Pro-CASP-1, and Pro-IL-1β in A549 cells, while failing to upregulate NLRP3 and Pro-IL-1β in PC3 cells. LPS-Az decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines while it induced the pro-angiogenic factors in A549 and PC3 cells. In contrast, LPS-Cf suppressed the expression of NLRP3-associated genes, NLRP3 protein expression, the inflammatory cytokine secretion in A549 and PC3 cells. LPS-Az and LPS-Cf had a limited effect on cell growth and viability.  Discussion:   Our data suggest that Cf could suppress LPS induced NLRP3, which should be considered when selecting antibiotics for cancer treatment. In contrast, the effect of Az on LPS primed NLRP3 and the inflammatory cytokines production appears to depend on the cancer cell origin.

Here, we propose a new method, DMRG, which constructs a weighted differential network (W-K-DN) to define the important metabolism-related genes. Based on biological knowledge and prostate cancer transcriptome data, a tripartite motif-containing 25 (TRIM25) was defined using DMRG; TRIM25 was involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism, which was verified by overexpressing or knocking down TRIM25 in PCa cell lines. Differential expression analysis of TCA cycle enzymes revealed that TRIM25 regulated isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and fumarate hydratase (FH) expression. Moreover, a protein-RNA interaction network of TRIM25 revealed that TRIM25 interacted with RNA-binding proteins, including DExH-box helicase 9 and DEAD-box helicase 5, to play a role in regulating the RNA processing of metabolic enzymes, including IDH1 and FH. Furthermore, TRIM25 expression level was found to be positively correlated with Gleason scores in PCa patient tissues.

However, most of the ZKSCAN3-induced carcinogenic mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we identified ZKSCAN3 as a downstream effector of the oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, using RNA sequencing and ChIP analyses. Activation of the Wnt pathway by recombinant Wnt gene family proteins or the GSK inhibitor, CHIR 99021 upregulated ZKSCAN3 expression in a β-catenin-dependent manner. Furthermore, ZKSCAN3 upregulation suppressed the expression of the mitotic spindle checkpoint protein, Mitotic Arrest Deficient 2 Like 2 (MAD2L2) by inhibiting its promoter activity and eventually inducing chromosomal instability in colon cancer cells. Conversely, deletion or knockdown of ZKSCAN3 increased MAD2L2 expression and delayed cell cycle progression. In addition, ZKSCAN3 upregulation by oncogenic WNT/β-catenin signaling is an early event of the adenoma-carcinoma sequence in colon cancer development.

Here, transcriptomic-based secretome analysis was performed on the PCa tumor transcriptome of Genetically Engineered Mouse Model (GEMM) Pb-Cre4/Ptenf/f mice to identify potentially secreted and membrane proteins-PSPs and PMPs. We combined a selection of transcripts from the GSE 94574 dataset and a list of protein-coding genes of the secretome and membrane proteome datasets using the Human Protein Atlas Secretome.

Our OAds, AdΔΔ and Ad-3∆-A20T, selectively infect, replicate in, and kill adenocarcinoma cells with the added benefit of re-sensitising drug-resistant cells in preclinical models. Further modifications are required to enable systemic delivery in patients due to the rapid hepatic elimination and neutralisation by blood factors and antibodies. Here, we show data that support the use of coating OAds with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as a possible new method of virus modification to help augment tumour uptake. The pre-incubation of cationic AuNPs with AdΔΔ, Ad-3∆-A20T and wild type adenovirus (Ad5wt) was performed prior to infection of prostate/pancreatic cancer cell lines (22Rv, PC3, Panc04.03, PT45) and a pancreatic stellate cell line (PS1). Levels of viral infection, replication and cell viability were quantified 24-72 h post-infection in the presence and absence of AuNPs. Viral spread was assessed in organotypic cultures. The presence of AuNPs significantly increased the uptake of Ad∆∆, Ad-3∆-A20T and Ad5wt in all the cell lines tested (ranging from 1.5-fold to 40-fold), compared to virus alone, with the greatest uptake observed in PS1, a usually adenovirus-resistant cell line. Pre-coating the AdΔΔ and Ad-3∆-A20T with AuNPs also increased viral replication, leading to enhanced cell killing, with maximal effect in the most virus-insensitive cells (from 1.4-fold to 5-fold).

Recent genome-wide studies have strongly suggested an interaction between the pathways involved in the cellular response to DDR and in the regulation of RNA metabolism, but the molecular mechanism(s) involved in this crosstalk are largely unknown. Herein, we found that activation of the DDR kinase ATM promotes its interaction with Sam68, leading to phosphorylation of this multifunctional RNA binding protein (RBP) on three residues: threonine 61, serine 388 and serine 390. Moreover, we demonstrate that ATM-dependent phosphorylation of threonine 61 promotes the function of Sam68 in the DDR pathway and enhances its RNA processing activity. Importantly, ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Sam68 in prostate cancer cells modulates alternative polyadenylation of transcripts that are targets of Sam68, supporting the notion that the ATM-Sam68 axis exerts a multifaceted role in the response to DNA damage. Thus, our work validates Sam68 as an ATM kinase substrate and uncovers an unexpected bidirectional interplay between ATM and Sam68, which couples the DDR pathway to modulation of RNA metabolism in response to genotoxic stress.""","""['Venturina Stagni', 'Silvia Orecchia', 'Luca Mignini', 'Sara Beji', 'Ambra Antonioni', 'Cinzia Caggiano', 'Daniela Barilà', 'Pamela Bielli', 'Claudio Sette']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Genotoxic stress causes the accumulation of the splicing regulator Sam68 in nuclear foci of transcriptionally active chromatin.', 'Cdk1-mediated threonine phosphorylation of Sam68 modulates its RNA binding, alternative splicing activity and cellular functions.', 'The RNA-binding protein Sam68 modulates the alternative splicing of Bcl-x.', 'ATM, ATR and DNA-PKcs kinases-the lessons from the mouse models: inhibition\u2009≠\u2009deletion.', 'The RNA-binding protein Sam68 is a multifunctional player in human cancer.', 'A Triphenylphosphonium-Functionalized Delivery System for an ATM Kinase Inhibitor That Ameliorates Doxorubicin Resistance in Breast Carcinoma Mammospheres.', 'Hepatic Sam68 Regulates Systemic Glucose Homeostasis and Insulin Sensitivity.']"""

G4 motif stabilization induces DNA damage and cancer cell death; therefore, G4-targeting small molecules are the focus of clinical investigation. DNA destabilization induced by G4 ligands might potentiate the anticancer activity of agents targeting DNA or inhibiting its repair such as oncolytic viruses. This study represents the first approach combining G4 ligands, BRACO-19 (B19), pyridostatin (PDS), and the adenovirus dl922-947 in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that G4 binders and dl922-947 induce cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7) and at higher doses in other neoplastic cell lines of thyroid (BHT-101 cells) and prostate (PC3 cells). G4 binders induce G4 motifs distributed in the S and G2/M phases in MCF-7 cells. G4 binder/dl922-947 combination increases cell cytotoxicity and the accumulation in subG0/G1. Indeed, G4 binders favor viral entry and replication with no effect on coxsackie and adenovirus receptor. Notably, dl922-947 induces G4 motifs and its combination with PDS potentiates this effect in MCF-7 cells. The agents alone or in combination similarly enhanced cell senescence. Additionally, PDS/dl922-947 combination inactivates STING signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells.

The signalling adapter protein CARD14 is specifically expressed in epithelial cells, where it has been shown to mediate NF-κB signalling, but a role for CARD14 in carcinoma has not yet been described. By analysing existing cancer databases, we found that CARD14 overexpression strongly correlates with aggressive PCa in human patients. Moreover, we showed that CARD14 is overexpressed in the LNCaP PCa cell line and that knockdown of CARD14 severely reduces LNCaP cell survival. Similarly, knockdown of BCL10 and MALT1, which are known to form a signalling complex with CARD14, also induced LNCaP cell death. MALT1 is a paracaspase that mediates downstream signalling by acting as a scaffold, as well as a protease. Recent studies have already indicated a role for the scaffold function of MALT1 in PCa cell growth. Here, we also demonstrated constitutive MALT1 proteolytic activity in several PCa cell lines, leading to cleavage of A20 and CYLD. Inhibition of MALT1 protease activity did not affect PCa cell survival nor activation of NF-κB and JNK signalling, but reduced expression of cancer-associated genes, including the cytokine IL-6. Taken together, our results revealed a novel role for CARD14-induced signalling in regulating PCa cell survival and gene expression.

Interestingly, SAL induces cell senescence in PCa cell lines as well as ex vivo in tumor samples of patients. The SAL-mediated cell senescence was shown to be androgen receptor (AR)-dependent and mediated in part by non-genomic AKT signaling. RNA-seq analyses compared with and without SAL treatment as well as by AKT inhibition (AKTi) revealed a specific transcriptome landscape. Comparing the top 100 genes similarly regulated by SAL in two human PCa cell lines that undergo cell senescence and being counteracted by AKTi revealed 33 commonly regulated genes. One gene, ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1), encodes the mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6) that is potently upregulated by SAL, whereas the combinatory treatment of SAL with AKTi reverses the SAL-mediated upregulation. Functionally, knockdown of ERRFI1 enhances the pro-survival AKT pathway by enhancing phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream AKT target S6, whereas the phospho-retinoblastoma (pRb) protein levels were decreased. Further, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p15INK4b is enhanced by SAL and ERRFI1 knockdown. In line with this, cell senescence is induced by ERRFI1 knockdown and is enhanced slightly further by SAL. Treatment of SAL in the ERRFI1 knockdown background enhances phosphorylation of both AKT and S6 whereas pRb becomes hypophosphorylated. Interestingly, the ERRFI1 knockdown does not reduce AR protein levels or AR target gene expression, suggesting that MIG6 does not interfere with genomic signaling of AR but represses androgen-induced cell senescence and might therefore counteract SAL-induced signaling. The findings indicate that SAL treatment, used in BAT, upregulates MIG6, which inactivates both pRb and the pro-survival AKT signaling.

We evaluated PCa incidence and PCa-specific mortality between different municipalities and hospital districts in Finland over 1985-2019.  Material and methods:   Men diagnosed with PCa in Finland from 1985 through 2019 were retrieved from Finnish Cancer Registry. Age-standardized PCa incidence and mortality rates were estimated by municipality and hospital district as well as municipality urbanization, education, and income level using hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Standard deviations (SD) of the regional rates were compared between periods from 1985-1989 to 2015-2019.  Results:   We identified 123,185 men diagnosed with any stage PCa between 1985 and 2019. SD of PCa incidence rate (per 100,000 person-years) showed that the total variation of PCa incidence between different municipalities was substantial and varied over time: from 22.2 (95% CI, 17.1-27.8) in 1985-1989 to 56.5 (95% CI, 49.8-64.5) in 2000-2004. The SD of PCa mortality rate between all municipalities was from 9.0 (95% CI, 6.6-11.8) in 2005-2009 to 2.4 (95% CI, 0.9-4.8) in 2015-2019. There was a trend toward a lower PCa-specific mortality rate in municipalities with higher education level.  Discussion:   Regional variation in the incidence rate of PCa became more evident after initiation of PSA testing in Finland, which indicates that early diagnostic practice (PSA testing) of PCa has been different in different parts of the country. Variation in the national PCa mortality rate was indeed recognizable, however, this variation diminished at the same time as the mortality rate declined in Finland.

However, the role of circRNAs in regulating macrophages in prostate cancer (PCa) remains uncertain.  Methods:   Differentially expressed circRNAs in PCa were identified by RNA sequencing. The expression of circSMARCC1 was recognized and evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR. The oncogenic role of circSMARCC1 in PCa tumor proliferation and metastasis was investigated through a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. Finally, Western blot, biotin-labeled RNA pulldown, luciferase assay, rescue experiments, and co-culture experiments with TAMs were conducted to reveal the mechanistic role of circSMARCC1.  Results:   CircSMARCC1 was dramatically up-regulated in PCa cells, plasma and tissues. Overexpression of circSMARCC1 promotes tumor proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, whereas knockdown of circSMARCC1 exerts the opposite effects. Mechanistically, circSMARCC1 regulates the expression of CC-chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) via sponging miR-1322 and activate PI3K-Akt signaling pathway involved in the proliferation and epithelial mesenchymal transformation. More importantly, high expression of circSMARCC1 was positively associated with colonization of CD68+/CD163+/CD206+ TAMs in tumor microenvironment. In addition, overexpression of circSMARCC1 facilitates the expression of CD163 in macrophages through the CCL20-CCR6 axis, induces TAMs infiltration and M2 polarization, thereby leading to PCa progression.

Mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa are 2.5-fold greater than global averages. However, the region has largely been excluded from the benefits of whole genome interrogation studies. Additionally, while structural variation (SV) is highly prevalent, PCa genomic studies are still biased towards small variant interrogation.  Methods:   Using whole genome sequencing and best practice workflows, we performed a comprehensive analysis of SVs for 180 (predominantly Gleason score ≥ 8) prostate tumours derived from 115 African, 61 European and four ancestrally admixed patients. We investigated the landscape and relationship of somatic SVs in driving ethnic disparity (African versus European), with a focus on African men from southern Africa.  Results:   Duplication events showed the greatest ethnic disparity, with a 1.6- (relative frequency) to 2.5-fold (count) increase in African-derived tumours. Furthermore, we found duplication events to be associated with CDK12 inactivation and MYC copy number gain, and deletion events associated with SPOP mutation. Overall, African-derived tumours were 2-fold more likely to present with a hyper-SV subtype. In addition to hyper-duplication and deletion subtypes, we describe a new hyper-translocation subtype. While we confirm a lower TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive rate in tumours from African cases (10% versus 33%), novel African-specific PCa ETS family member and TMPRSS2 fusion partners were identified, including LINC01525, FBXO7, GTF3C2, NTNG1 and YPEL5. Notably, we found 74 somatic SV hotspots impacting 18 new candidate driver genes, with CADM2, LSAMP, PTPRD, PDE4D and PACRG having therapeutic implications for African patients.  Conclusions:   In this first African-inclusive SV study for high-risk PCa, we demonstrate the power of SV interrogation for the identification of novel subtypes, oncogenic drivers and therapeutic targets.

Poor prognosis has been a reflection of increased advance-staged diagnosis and inadequate financial assistance. The prioritization of resources cannot be effective enough to factor in the unexpected economic burden resulting from ill health unless health economic approaches are utilized to estimate the cost of diseases including PCa. With the absence of data on the cost of PCa in Ghana, and the evidence of the benefits of PCa cost-of-illness studies on cancer financing, it has become imperative to investigate the direct health cost of PCa on patients and careers. Hence, we investigate the cost of PCa diagnosis and management, the availability and prices of PCa medications, and the affordability of PCa care in Ghana.  Methods:   The prevalence approach to cost-of-illness studies was adopted in this study through a random selection of two (2) hospitals, four (4) private laboratories, and ten (10) private community pharmacies in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The diagnostic and management cost of PCa was investigated through the application of validated data collection instruments to representatives of the selected hospitals and laboratories. The availability and prices of PCa medications were studied with the administration of a validated tool to representatives of the selected pharmacies. The data were analyzed with Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet and the affordability of care was assessed considering the 2021 Ghana National Daily Minimum Wage (GNDMW).  Results:   The cost of diagnosing non-metastatic and metastatic PCa were respectively estimated at GHC 1686.00 ($ 290.58) and GHC 6876.00 ($ 1185.09). Radical prostatectomy, as a management option, was estimated at GHC 2150.00 ($ 370.56) higher than Extended Beam Radiotherapy (GHC 2150.00: $ 370.56). The mean PCa drug availability for the sampled pharmacies around the public hospital, all the sampled pharmacies, and around the private hospital were respectively 61.54, 51.54, and 41.54%. None of the sampled drugs at the stated strengths had a 100% availability. A 6-month androgen deprivation therapy employing goserelin was GHC 3000.00 ($ 517.05). The median drug price ratio (MDPR) was 0.72 - 15.38, with generic bicalutamide 150 mg tablets as the cheapest and generic flutamide 250 mg tablets as the most expensive.  Conclusion:   The diagnostic and management cost of PCa currently overwhelms the average Ghanaian because the minimum daily wage in 2021 is GHC 12.53 ($ 0.46). A higher economic burden was associated with metastatic PCa and hence, the need for strategies to improve early detection. Also, the inclusion of PCa management in the National Health Insurance Scheme would lessen the financial burden of the disease on patients and careers, and improve management outcomes.""","""['Ebenezer Wiafe', 'Kofi Boamah Mensah', 'Kwaku Addai Arhin Appiah', 'Frasia Oosthuizen', 'Varsha Bangalee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""['Correction: The direct cost incurred by patients and caregivers in diagnosing and managing prostate cancer in Ghana.', 'Evaluating essential medicines for treating childhood cancers: availability, price and affordability study in Ghana.', 'Economic burden of family caregiving for elderly population in southern Ghana: the case of a peri-urban district.', 'Evaluation of prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Lahore Division, Pakistan: A cross-sectional survey using WHO/HAI methodology.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

African ancestry is a significant risk factor, with mortality rates across sub-Saharan Africa of 2.7-fold higher than global averages1. The contributing genetic and non-genetic factors, and associated mutational processes, are unknown2,3. Here, through whole-genome sequencing of treatment-naive prostate cancer samples from 183 ancestrally (African versus European) and globally distinct patients, we generate a large cancer genomics resource for sub-Saharan Africa, identifying around 2 million somatic variants. Significant African-ancestry-specific findings include an elevated tumour mutational burden, increased percentage of genome alteration, a greater number of predicted damaging mutations and a higher total of mutational signatures, and the driver genes NCOA2, STK19, DDX11L1, PCAT1 and SETBP1. Examining all somatic mutational types, we describe a molecular taxonomy for prostate cancer differentiated by ancestry and defined as global mutational subtypes (GMS). By further including Chinese Asian data, we confirm that GMS-B (copy-number gain) and GMS-D (mutationally noisy) are specific to African populations, GMS-A (mutationally quiet) is universal (all ethnicities) and the African-European-restricted subtype GMS-C (copy-number losses) predicts poor clinical outcomes. In addition to the clinical benefit of including individuals of African ancestry, our GMS subtypes reveal different evolutionary trajectories and mutational processes suggesting that both common genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disparity between ethnicities. Analogous to gene-environment interaction-defined here as a different effect of an environmental surrounding in people with different ancestries or vice versa-we anticipate that GMS subtypes act as a proxy for intrinsic and extrinsic mutational processes in cancers, promoting global inclusion in landmark studies.""","""['Weerachai Jaratlerdsiri', 'Jue Jiang', 'Tingting Gong', 'Sean M Patrick', 'Cali Willet', 'Tracy Chew', 'Ruth J Lyons', 'Anne-Maree Haynes', 'Gabriela Pasqualim', 'Melanie Louw', 'James G Kench', 'Raymond Campbell', 'Lisa G Horvath', 'Eva K F Chan', 'David C Wedge', 'Rosemarie Sadsad', 'Ilma Simoni Brum', 'Shingai B A Mutambirwa', 'Phillip D Stricker', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nature""","""['Ancestry-defined molecular taxonomy of prostate cancer.', 'Genome-wide interrogation of structural variation reveals novel African-specific prostate cancer oncogenic drivers.', 'Whole-Genome Sequencing Reveals Elevated Tumor Mutational Burden and Initiating Driver Mutations in African Men with Treatment-Naïve, High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Integrative comparison of the genomic and transcriptomic landscape between prostate cancer patients of predominantly African or European genetic ancestry.', 'Prostate Cancer Genomics: Recent Advances and the Prevailing Underrepresentation from Racial and Ethnic Minorities.', 'Biological determinants of health disparities in prostate cancer.', 'Alterations in the Epigenetic Machinery Associated with Prostate Cancer Health Disparities.', 'Challenges and opportunities for implementing hypofractionated radiotherapy in Africa: lessons from the HypoAfrica clinical trial.', 'Distinct mesenchymal cell states mediate prostate cancer progression.']"""

Patients and methods:   In phase Ia (dose escalation), patients had relapsed/refractory solid tumors; in phase Ib (dose expansion), patients had checkpoint inhibitor-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) or colorectal carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer with prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 exposure, or other solid tumors (checkpoint-naïve or prior anti-PD-1/PD-L1 exposure). Patients received AZD4635 monotherapy (75-200 mg once daily or 125 mg twice daily) or in combination with durvalumab (AZD4635 75 or 100 mg once daily). The primary objective was safety; secondary objectives included antitumor activity and pharmacokinetics; exploratory objectives included evaluation of an adenosine gene signature in patients with mCRPC.  Results:   As of September 8, 2020, 250 patients were treated (AZD4635, n = 161; AZD4635+durvalumab, n = 89).

The most common treatment-related adverse events included nausea, fatigue, vomiting, decreased appetite, dizziness, and diarrhea. The RP2D of the AZD4635 capsule formulation was 75 mg once daily, as monotherapy or in combination with durvalumab. The pharmacokinetic profile was dose-proportional, and exposure was adequate to cover target with 100 mg nanosuspension or 75 mg capsule once daily.

Furthermore, samples may fail because of difficulties within the testing procedure. Optimization of screening techniques may reduce failure rates; however, a need remains for additional testing methods to detect cancers with alterations in homologous recombination repair genes. We evaluated the utility of plasma-derived circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in identifying deleterious BRCA1, BRCA2 (BRCA), and ATM alterations in screened patients with mCRPC from the phase III PROfound study.  Patients and methods:   Tumor tissue samples were sequenced prospectively at Foundation Medicine, Inc.

Matched ctDNA samples were retrospectively sequenced at FMI, using an investigational assay based on FoundationOne®Liquid CDx.  Results:   81% (503/619) of ctDNA samples yielded an NGS result, of which 491 had a tumor tissue result. BRCA and ATM status in tissue compared with ctDNA showed 81% positive percentage agreement and 92% negative percentage agreement, using tissue as reference. At variant-subtype level, using tissue as reference, concordance was high for nonsense (93%), splice (87%), and frameshift (86%) alterations but lower for large rearrangements (63%) and homozygous deletions (27%), with low ctDNA fraction being a limiting factor.

While hormonal therapy (HT) is efficacious, most patients evolve to an incurable castration-resistant stage (CRPC). To date, most proposed mechanisms of acquired resistance to HT have focused on AR transcriptional activity. Herein, we uncover a new role for the AR in alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA). Inhibition of the AR by Enzalutamide globally regulates APA in PC cells, with specific enrichment in genes related to transcription and DNA topology, suggesting their involvement in transcriptome reprogramming. AR inhibition selects promoter-distal polyadenylation sites (pAs) enriched in cis-elements recognized by the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) complex. Conversely, promoter-proximal intronic pAs relying on the cleavage stimulation factor (CSTF) complex are repressed. Mechanistically, Enzalutamide induces rearrangement of APA subcomplexes and impairs the interaction between CPSF and CSTF. AR inhibition also induces co-transcriptional CPSF recruitment to gene promoters, predisposing the selection of pAs depending on this complex. Importantly, the scaffold CPSF160 protein is up-regulated in CRPC cells and its depletion represses HT-induced APA patterns. These findings uncover an unexpected role for the AR in APA regulation and suggest that APA-mediated transcriptome reprogramming represents an adaptive response of PC cells to HT.""","""['Cinzia Caggiano', 'Marco Pieraccioli', 'Consuelo Pitolli', 'Gabriele Babini', 'Dinghai Zheng', 'Bin Tian', 'Pamela Bielli', 'Claudio Sette']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nucleic Acids Res""","""['CYCLIN K down-regulation induces androgen receptor gene intronic polyadenylation, variant expression and PARP inhibitor vulnerability in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel androgen receptor antagonist JJ-450 inhibits enzalutamide-resistant mutant ARF876L nuclear import and function.', 'Loss of a Negative Feedback Loop between IRF8 and AR Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

The common targets of SGG and MDD were imported to the STRING11.0 database, and then a protein-protein interaction network was constructed. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment were analyzed with DAVID 6.8 database. The molecular weight of SGG was 472.7 g/mol, the topological polar surface area was 69.92 A2 <140 A2, the octanol/water partition coefficient (Consensus LogP0/W) was 4.80, the rotatable bond was 1, the hydrogen bond donors was 3, and the hydrogen bond acceptors was 4.

Previously, we found that plasma exosomal miR-375 is significantly elevated in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) patients compared with castration-sensitive PCa patients. Here, we aimed to determine how miR-375 modulates CRPC progression and thereafter to evaluate the therapeutic potential of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hucMSC)-derived exosomes loaded with miR-375 antisense oligonucleotides (e-375i). We used miRNA in situ hybridization technique to evaluate miR-375 expression in PCa tissues, gain- and loss-of-function experiments to determine miR-375 function, and bioinformatic methods, dual-luciferase reporter assay, qPCR, IHC and western blotting to determine and validate the target as well as the effects of miR-375 at the molecular level. Then, e-375i complexes were assessed for their antagonizing effects against miR-375. We found that the expression of miR-375 was elevated in PCa tissues and cancer exosomes, correlating with the Gleason score. Forced expression of miR-375 enhanced the expression of EMT markers and AR but suppressed apoptosis markers, leading to enhanced proliferation, migration, invasion, and enzalutamide resistance and decreased apoptosis of PCa cells. These effects could be reversed by miR-375 silencing.

Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) could potentially complicate EOL care planning among persons with cancer. Little is known about the aggressive EOL care patterns among Medicare beneficiaries with both cancer and ADRD.  Materials and methods:   A matched retrospective cohort was created using the 2004 to 2016 Surveillance, Epidemiology, End Results-Medicare (SEER-Medicare) data differentiated by beneficiaries' ADRD status. Beneficiaries with breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer who died between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2016, were included. Six existing domains of aggressive EOL care and one overall indicator were derived. The major predictor was having ADRD comorbidity; other covariates included sex, marital status, census tract poverty indicator, race/ethnicity, metro status, geographic location, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), survival time, cancer site, and histology stage. Multivariable logistic regression models were deployed to estimate the odds of receiving aggressive EOL care.  Results:   The study sample was 135,380 people after the one-to-one propensity score matching. The prevalence of aggressive EOL care utilization was slightly lower in beneficiaries with both cancer and ADRD when compared to beneficiaries with cancer only (54% vs. 58%, p < 0.0001). Beneficiaries with both cancer and ADRD were less likely to receive aggressive EOL care (AOR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) versus beneficiaries with cancer only. From the multivariable logistic regression model, certain beneficiaries' characteristics were associated with higher odds of receiving aggressive EOL care, such as: beneficiaries belonging to a racial/ethnic minority, a shorter survival time, and a higher CCI score.  Discussion:   The combined presence of ADRD and cancer was associated with lower odds of receiving aggressive EOL care compared to the presence of only cancer; however, the prevalence difference between the cohorts was not huge. Future studies could conduct in-depth evaluations of the ADRD's influence on the EOL care utilization.""","""['Xingran Weng', 'Chan Shen', 'Lauren J Van Scoy', 'Marie Boltz', 'Monika Joshi', 'Li Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""[""End-of-Life Costs of Cancer Patients With Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias in the U.S."", ""End-of-Life Healthcare Utilization of Older Mexican Americans With and Without a Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias."", 'End-of-Life Care among Nursing Home Residents with Dementia Varies by Nursing Home and Market Characteristics.', ""Let's Not Repeat History's Mistakes: Two Cautions to Scientists on the Use of Race in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias Research."", ""Neurovascular Dysfunction in Diverse Communities With Health Disparities-Contributions to Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease."", 'End-of-Life Care in the Last Three Months before Death in Older Patients with Cancer in Belgium: A Large Retrospective Cohort Study Using Data Linkage.']"""

No surgical technique has so far shown success in reducing the incidence rate, but several retrospective studies have shown the beneficial effect of the fixation of the peritoneum.  Objective:   To introduce a modification in the technique of fixing the peritoneum to the pubic bone and to confirm whether this intervention reduces the incidence of lymphoceles.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective randomized (1:1) single-center one-sided blind study was conducted in patients with localized prostate cancer (cT1-2cN0M0) indicated for RARP with ePLND operated between December 2019 and June 2021. In the intervention group, the free flap of the peritoneum was fixed to the pubic bone. In the control group, the peritoneal flap was left free without fixation.  Surgical procedure:   In the intervention group, the free flap of the peritoneum was fixed to the pubic bone (PerFix) so that lateral holes were left, allowing drainage of lymph from the pelvis into the abdominal cavity, where it would be resorbed. The iliac vessels and obturator fossa remained uncovered by the peritoneum and the bladder.  Measurements:   The primary objective was to evaluate the frequency of symptomatic lymphoceles during follow-up. The secondary endpoints were the radiological presence of lymphoceles on computed tomography of the pelvis carried out 6 wk after surgery, the volume of the lymphoceles, and the degree of severe (Clavien-Dindo ≥3) complications.  Results and limitations:   Of the 260 randomized patients, 245 were evaluated in the final analysis-123 in the intervention and 122 in the control group. The median follow-up was 595 d. There were no differences between the groups regarding clinical and pathological variables. The median of 17 nodes removed was the same in both groups (p = 0.961). Symptomatic lymphoceles occurred in 17 patients (6.9%), while in the intervention group these were found in three (2.4%) versus 14 (11.5%) in the control group (p = 0.011). The number of radiologically detected asymptomatic lymphoceles did not differ (p = 0.095). There was no significant difference in lymphocele volume between the two groups (p = 0.118). The rate of serious complications (Clavien 3a and 3b) was 4.8% in the intervention group and 9.1% in the control group (p = 0.587). A multivariate logistic regression model of symptomatic lymphocele occurrence was created with significant factors: body mass index (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [1.03, 1.26], p = 0.012) and intervention (OR = 4.6, 95% CI = [1.28, 16.82], p = 0.02).  Conclusions:   Fixation of the peritoneum (PerFix) reduced the incidence of symptomatic lymphoceles in RARP with ePLND. We found no difference in the frequency of asymptomatic lymphocele development. The volume of the detected lymphoceles was similar.  Patient summary:   In this study, we compared the rate of development of postoperative complications using the peritoneal fixation technique with that of a nonfixation control group for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy. Fixation of the peritoneum should obviate the development of severe complications in the postoperative period.""","""['Vladimir Student Jr', 'Zbynek Tudos', 'Zuzana Studentova', 'Ondrej Cesak', 'Hana Studentova', 'Vaclav Repa', 'Dana Purova', 'Vladimir Student']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Laparoscopy/New Technology.', 'Four-point Peritoneal Flap Fixation in Preventing Lymphocele Formation Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Bilateral Peritoneal Flaps Reduce Incidence and Complications of Lymphoceles after Robotic Radical Prostatectomy with Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection-Results of the Prospective Randomized Multicenter Trial ProLy.', 'Extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and various radical prostatectomy techniques: is pelvic drainage necessary?', 'How to minimize lymphoceles and treat clinically symptomatic lymphoceles after radical prostatectomy.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: efficacy, limitations, and complications-a systematic review of the literature.', 'High BMI and Surgical Time Are Significant Predictors of Lymphocele after Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.']"""

The occupational privilege of health care providers (HCPs) is expected to play a positive role in cancer screening practices. Therefore, this study aimed to assess perceptions and personal attitudes of HCPs regarding their decision to screen for cancer in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.  Design:   A cross-sectional multicenter survey study was conducted. A well-designed and validated questionnaire was distributed to the HCPs at three tertiary hospitals in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia.  Results:   Out of 900 health care providers who received the questionnaire, 372 completed it. Two-thirds, 247 (66.4%) of them were nurses and the rest were physicians and the mean age was 34.1 ± 7.1 years. Regardless of gender, profession, or age, the overall rate of belief in the importance of regular cancer screening was high; 91.4%. The number of participants who did not screen for colonoscopy was significantly higher than those who screened. The number of females in the age group of between 45 and 54 years who screened with mammography was significantly higher than non-screened. In a similar way, male HCPs above 54 years who got themselves screened for Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) were significantly higher than those who did not.

We aimed to develop a deep learning-based prediction model with minimized parameters and missing value handling algorithms for PC and clinically significant PC (CSPC).  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed data from 18 824 prostate biopsies collected between March 2003 and December 2020 from 2 databases, resulting in 12 739 cases in the PSA gray zone of 2.0-10.0 ng/mL. Dense neural network (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models for PC and CSPC were developed with 5-fold cross-validation. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was compared with that of serum PSA, PSA density, free PSA (fPSA) portion, and prostate health index (PHI).  Results:   The AUROC values in the DNN model with the imputation of missing values were 0.739 and 0.708 (PC) and 0.769 and 0.742 (CSPC) in internal and external validation, whereas those of the non-imputed dataset were 0.740 and 0.771 (PC) and 0.807 and 0.771 (CSPC), respectively. The performance of the DNN model was like that of the XGBoost model, but better than all tested clinical biomarkers for both PC and CSPC. The developed DNN model outperformed PHI, serum PSA, and percent-fPSA with or without missing value imputation.  Discussion:   DNN models for missing value imputation can be used to predict PC and CSPC. Further validation in real-life scenarios are need to recommend for actual implementation, but the results from our study support the increasing role of deep learning analytics in the clinical setting.

We conducted user testing to assess comprehension, utility, and preference of longitudinal PRO visualizations designed for prostate cancer survivors with limited literacy.  Materials and methods:   Building upon our prior work co-designing longitudinal PRO visualizations with survivors, we engaged 18 prostate cancer survivors in a user study to assess 4 prototypes: Meter, Words, Comic, and Emoji. During remote sessions, we collected data on prototype comprehension (gist and verbatim), utility, and preference.  Results:   Participants were aged 61-77 (M = 69), of whom half were African American. The majority of participants had less than a college degree (95%), had inadequate health literacy (78%), and low graph literacy (89%). Among the 4 prototypes, Meter had the best gist comprehension and was preferred. Emoji was also preferred, had the highest verbatim comprehension, and highest rated utility, including helpfulness, confidence, and satisfaction. Meter and Words both rated mid-range for utility, and Words scored lower than Emoji and Meter for comprehension. Comic had the poorest comprehension, lowest utility, and was least preferred.

A recent tracer, 18 F-PSMA-1007, offers advantages concerning production and biokinetics compared to the standard tracer (68 Ga-PSMA-11). Until now, radiation dosimetry data for this ligand was limited to the material of three healthy volunteers. The purpose of this study is to study the biokinetics and dosimetry of 18 F-PSMA-1007.  Methods:   Twelve patients with prostate cancer were injected with 4 MBq/kg 18 F-PSMA-1007. Eight PET-CT scans with concomitant blood sampling were performed up to 330 min after injection. Urine was collected until the following morning. Volumes of interest for radiation-sensitive organs and organs with high uptake of 18 F-PSMA-1007 were drawn in the PET images. A biokinetic compartment model was developed using activity data from PET images and blood and urine samples. Time-activity curves and time-integrated activity coefficients for all delineated organs were calculated. The software IDAC-dose 2.1 was used to calculate the absorbed and effective doses.  Results:   High concentrations of activity were noted in the liver, kidneys, parts of the small intestine, spleen, salivary glands, and lacrimal glands. The elimination through urine was 8% of injected activity in 20 h. The highest absorbed doses coefficients were in the lacrimal glands, kidneys, salivary glands, liver, and spleen (98-66 µGy/MBq). The effective dose coefficient was 25 µSv/MBq.

It is necessary to identify the pathogenesis of cancer at the molecular level and explore reliable treatment methods and precise drug targets in cancer by identifying carcinogenic functional modules in massive multi-omics data. However, there are still limitations to identifying carcinogenic driver modules by utilising genetic characteristics simply. Therefore, this study proposes a computational method, NetAP, to identify driver modules in prostate cancer. Firstly, high mutual exclusivity, high coverage, and high topological similarity between genes are integrated to construct a weight function, which calculates the weight of gene pairs in a biological network. Secondly, the random walk method is utilised to reevaluate the strength of interaction among genes. Finally, the optimal driver modules are identified by utilising the affinity propagation algorithm. According to the results, the authors' method identifies more validated driver genes and driver modules compared with the other previous methods. Thus, the proposed NetAP method can identify carcinogenic driver modules effectively and reliably, and the experimental results provide a powerful basis for cancer diagnosis, treatment and drug targets.""","""['Zhongli Chen', 'Biting Liang', 'Yingfu Wu', 'Haoru Zhou', 'Yuchen Wang', 'Hao Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""IET Syst Biol""","""['Integrating Protein-Protein Interaction Networks and Somatic Mutation Data to Detect Driver Modules in Pan-Cancer.', 'Integrating multi-omics data to identify dysregulated modules in endometrial cancer.', 'Detection of Driver Modules with Rarely Mutated Genes in Cancers.', 'Identifying Cancer Specific Driver Modules Using a Network-Based Method.', 'Whole-exome sequencing reveals recurrent somatic mutation networks in cancer.']"""

Results:   At early stages, (n-3) PUFA increased the frequency of normal epithelium (3.8-fold) and decreased the frequency of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (3.3-fold) and in situ carcinoma (1.9-fold) in the gland, maintaining prostate pathological status similar to C8 group. At advanced stages, 50% of the animals developed a large primary tumor in both C20 and T20, and tumor weight did not differ (C20: 2.2 ± 2.4; T20: 2.8 ± 2.9 g). The ventral prostate of T12 and of T20 animals that did not develop primary tumors showed lower cell proliferation, tissue expressions of androgen (AR) and glucocorticoid (GR) receptors, than their respective controls. For these animals, (n-3) PUFA also avoided an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes, collagen fibers, and αSMA immunoreactivity, and preserved stromal gland microenvironment. (n-3) PUFA also lowered serum triglycerides and cholesterol, regulating the lipid metabolism of TRAMP mice.  Conclusions:   (n-3) PUFAs had a protective effect at early stages of PCa, delaying tumor progression in TRAMP mice, in parallel with reductions in cell proliferation, AR, and GR and maintenance of the stromal compartment of the gland. However, (n-3) PUFAs did not prevent the development of primary tumors for the T20 group, reinforcing the need for further investigation at advanced stages of disease.""","""['Gustavo M Amaro', 'Alana D T da Silva', 'Guilherme H Tamarindo', 'Celina de A Lamas', 'Sebastião R Taboga', 'Valéria Helena Alves Cagnon', 'Rejane M Góes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Effect of dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids on castration-resistant Pten-null prostate cancer.', 'High animal fat intake enhances prostate cancer progression and reduces glutathione peroxidase 3 expression in early stages of TRAMP mice.', 'Androgen-independent prostate cancer progression in the TRAMP model.', 'Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model: A good alternative to study PCa progression and chemoprevention approaches.', 'Dietary N-6 and N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostate cancer risk: a review of epidemiological and experimental evidence.']"""

Cell sheet technology is one of the advancements in tissue engineering for 3D cell-based therapy. In this study, we established ectopic and orthotopic PCa models by cell sheet technology, and then compared the efficiency of tumor formation with cell suspension injection.  Methods:   DU145 cells were seeded on 35 mm temperature-sensitive dishes to form PCa cell sheets, while the cell suspension with the same cell density was prepared. After transplanting into the nude mice, the tumor volumes were measured every 3 days and the tumor growth curves were conducted. At the time points of 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the transplantation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate the transplanting site and distant metastasis. Finally, the mice were sacrificed, and the related tissues were harvested for the further histological evaluation.  Results:   The orthotopic tumor formation rate of the cell sheet injection group was obviously better than that in cell suspension injection group (100% vs 67%). Compared with cell suspension injection, the tumors of DU145 cell sheet fragments injection had the higher density of micro-vessels, more collagen deposition, and lower apoptosis rate. There was no evidence of metastasis in forelimb, lung and liver was found by MRI and histological tests.  Conclusion:   We successfully cultured the DU145 cell sheet and can be used to establish ectopic and orthotopic PCa tumor-bearing models, which provide an application potential for preclinical drug development, drug-resistance mechanisms and patient individualized therapy.""","""['Dongliang Zhang#', 'Ying Wang#', 'Lei Liu', 'Zeng Li', 'Shengke Yang', 'Weixin Zhao', 'Xiang Wang', 'Hong Liao', 'Shukui Zhou']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Efficient intrahepatic tumor generation by cell sheet transplantation to fabricate orthotopic hepatocarcinoma-bearing model mice for drug testing.', 'Transplantation and magnetic resonance imaging of transplantable human glioma tissue in the brain of nude mice.', 'Efficient and Consistent Orthotopic Osteosarcoma Model by Cell Sheet Transplantation in the Nude Mice for Drug Testing.', 'Establishment of an orthotopic transplantation tumor model of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.', 'Animal models of bone metastasis.']"""

However, the molecular mechanism, expression, or function of the lncRNA XIST in PCa is not well understood. Therefore, the major goal of this study was to investigate the involvement of XIST in PCa.  Methods:   We used the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to conduct a pan-cancer bioinformatics analysis of XIST and identified that it may play an important role in prostate cancer. This finding was verified using clinical samples and in vitro assays. Finally, we constructed an XIST ceRNA network for prostate cancer.  Results:   Our in vitro and in vivo results showed that the XIST gene expression level was higher in PCa derived cells and tissues compared to that in normal cells and tissues. XIST gene expression level was positively correlated with the invasion and proliferation of tumour cells. Furthermore, the downregulation of XIST inhibited the growth of subcutaneous 22Rv1 xenografts in nude mice. In addition, we constructed a XIST ceRNA network. Consistent with previous studies, we found that the role of XIST is mediated through via sponges, such as miRNA -96-5p, miRNA -153-3p, and miRNA-182-5p.  Conclusion:   High expression level of XIST can lead to enhanced carcinogenicity in PCa.

Several second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors (SG-ARIs), including enzalutamide (ENZ), apalutamide (APA) and darolutamide (DARO), have been developed to better block the activity of AR. Unavoidably, emergence of resistance to these novel drugs still persists. Herein, we identified glutathione S-transferase Mu 2 (GSTM2) as an important determinant in the acquisition of resistance to SG-ARIs. Elevated GSTM2 was detected in enzalutamide-resistant (ENZ-R) PCa, and overexpression of GSTM2 in naïve enzalutamide-sensitive (ENZ-S) cells effectively transformed them to ENZ-R PCa. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), the upstream transcription factor, was implicated in the overexpression of GSTM2 in ENZ-R cells. Mechanistically, GSTM2 antagonized the effect of ENZ by rescuing cells from oxidative stress-associated damage and activation of p38 MAPK pathway.

Early studies indicated the bipolar androgen therapy via a cycling of high dose and low dose of androgen to suppress PCa growth might be effective in a select patient population. The detailed mechanisms, however, remain unclear. Here we found the capacity of natural killer (NK) cells to suppress the CRPC cells could be suppressed by a high dose of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Mechanism dissection indicates that transactivated AR can increase circularRNA-FKBP5 (circFKBP5) expression, which could sponge/inhibit miR-513a-5p that suppresses the PD-L1 expression via direct binding to its 3'UTR to negatively impact immune surveillance from NK cells. Preclinical data from in vitro cell lines and an in vivo mouse model indicate that targeting PD-L1 with sh-RNA or anti-PD-L1 antibody can enhance the high dose DHT effect to better suppress CRPC cell growth.

Methods:   Using the difference-in-difference approach, we evaluated whether the rate of change in the use of low-value PSA screening differed between the control group (men aged 75+, N=7,856,204 person-years) and the intervention group (men aged 70-74, N=5,329,192 person-years) enrolling in the Medicare Advantage plan without a history of prostate cancer within the OptumLabs Data Warehouse claims data (2009-2019).

We assumed a 12-month dissemination period.  Results:   Before the revised recommendation in 2012, the trends did not significantly differ between the 2 age groups with the odds of receiving PSA screening decreasing by 1.2% (95% confidence interval [1.0, 1.4%]) per quarter.

While there is very little literature on the matter and even fewer videos showing the actual surgical view with a step-by-step explanation in complex cases, VUAS robotic transabdominal surgery provides better view and reach, with potentially better continence results, without the need for pubectomy.  Methods:   A 72-year-old male was submitted to a failed ORP for Gleason 3+4 localized cancer 2 years before, where the wrong plane of dissection left behind prostate remnants and the seminal vesicles, which evolved with a complex stenosis and recurrent episodes of acute urinary retention (AUR) that started two weeks after the first catheter removal. Five endoscopic procedures in total were unsuccessful and AUR reoccurred. A vesico-urethral cystography (VUC) and multiparametric prostate and urethral MRI found the seminal vesicles with prostate remnants, two centimeters urethral stenosis from bladder neck to bulbar urethra and periurethral fibrosis with no evidence of residual tumor. PSA was 1.2 and prostate biopsy showed no tumor on prostate remnant. A transabdominal robotic approach was chosen.  Results:   Prostate residue, bladder neck and periurethral fibrosis were excised, with healthy mucosa found on both ends. End-to-end anastomosis was successful. Drain and catheter were removed on the 1st and 14th post-operative day, respectively, with good urinary stream. A VUC at 30 days showed a patent bladder neck. Incontinence was 3 pads/day after catheter removal and decreased to 1 pad/day after 180 days.  Conclusion:   VUAS may reach 15% (1, 2) and endourologic therapies are first-line choices, however, recalcitrant cases require reconstruction (3-6).

Investigators often hold a priori assumptions, rarely made explicit, regarding the relative importance of these factors. We studied 2,239 self-identified African Americans (SIAA) from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian screening trial enrolled from 1993-1998 and followed prospectively until 2019 or until death, whichever came first. Percent African genetic ancestry was estimated using the GRAF-Pop distance-based method. A neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) index was estimated using census tract measures of income, housing, and employment and linked to participant residence in 2012. We used Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to represent causal models favoring (1) biomedical and (2) social causes of mortality. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox models adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and neighborhood covariates guided by each DAG. 901 deaths occurred over 40,767 person-years of follow-up. In unadjusted (biomedical) models, a 10% increase in percent African ancestry was associated with a 7% higher rate of all-cause mortality (HR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.12). This effect was attenuated in covariate adjusted (social) models (aHR: 1.01, 95% CI: 0.96, 1.06). Mortality was lower comparing participants in the highest to lowest nSES quintile following adjustment for covariates and ancestry (aHR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.98, Ptrend = 0.017). Higher African ancestry and lower nSES were associated with higher mortality, but African ancestry was not associated with mortality following covariate adjustment.

There is a scarcity of studies regarding IPC reported from Sub-Saharan African Countries, including Somalia. The present is the first study that evaluates the incidence and associated factors for IPC among patients who had surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia at a tertiary hospital in Somalia.  Method:   This retrospective study reviewed the data of 538 patients with benign prostate hyperplasia, 464 patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and 74 patients with open prostatectomy (OP) over 5 years. A binary logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between perioperative factors such as age, prostate volume, total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA) levels, type of surgery, specimen weight, and the finding of IPC.  Results:   IPC was detected in 17.6%, 18.3% of TURP, and 13.5% of OP patients (p = 0.002). The mean age of the patients was 71.82 ± 7.4; IPC patients had a significantly higher mean age than the BPH group (74 ± 10.9 vs. 71.3 ± 10.8, p < 0.001). Sixty-two percent of the patients were T1b, while 57.8% had ISUP grade groups 1 and 2. Patients with T1a had significantly higher International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades 1 and 2 than those with T1b (69.4% in T1a vs. 50.8% in T1b, p < 0.001). Increased age, higher TPSA levels, low prostate volume, and specimen weight were independently associated with the finding of incidental prostate carcinoma (OR 1.978, 95% CI 0.95-1.60, P < 0.04; OR 1.839, 95% CI 0.99-2.02, P < 0.001; OR 1.457, 95% CI 0.7102.99, P < 0.001, OR 0.989, 95% CI 1.07-2.94, P = 0.01). IPC was most commonly managed by active surveillance (54.7%), followed by androgen deprivation therapy in 28.4%. The overall survival rate for a 5-year follow-up in the entire cohort was 79%. The cancer-specific mortality was 8.4%.  Conclusion:   The study findings revealed a higher incidence and cancer-specific mortality rate of incidental prostate carcinoma. T1b stage, higher ISUP grade, older age, and higher preoperative TPSA were significantly associated with the overall mortality and cancer-specific mortality rate. More than half of the cases were managed by active surveillance, and it is a safe management strategy, particularly in low-income countries like Somalia.""","""['Abdikarim Hussein Mohamed', 'Ismail Mohamud Abdullahi', 'Feysal Farah Warsame', 'Hussein Ali Mohamud']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Incidental Prostate Cancer in Patients Treated for Benign Prostate Hyperplasia in the Period of 21 Years.', 'Incidental finding of prostate cancer in Transurethral Resection of Prostate (TURP) specimens: a retrospective analysis from a Tertiary Care Hospital in Pakistan.', 'Diagnosis and treatment of T1a-T1b prostate cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy for impalpable prostate cancer: the Johns Hopkins experience with tumors found on transurethral resection (stages T1A and T1B) and on needle biopsy (stage T1C).', 'Microwave thermotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia.', '95% Confidence intervals or P-values?']"""

Methods:   Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of science databases were searched to identify any studies reporting the SIRs of SPM following CRC until August 2021. Total and site-specific SIRs with different restriction to lag period were pooled using fixed/random effect models.  Results:   A total of 42 full-text publications with more than 1, 524, 236 CRC survivors and 166, 210 SPM patients were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled data showed an increased SIRs for all SPMs in CRC survivors with different restriction to lag period (no restriction to lag period, SIR = 1.15, 95% CI = [1.08-1.23]; 1-year lag, 1.16 [1.10-1.23]; 5-year lag, 1.18 [1.09-1.28]; 10-year lag, 1.24 [1.11-1.39]).

Methods:   Bioinformatics analysis was used to obtain the expression of FUS and its mRNA modification in PRAD. The expression of FUS in prostate cells (CRPC) and the level of m6A methylation modification, ferroptosis (P53 and GPX4), apoptosis (Caspase3), ferroptosis (P53 and GPX4), and apoptosis (Caspase3) in CRPC after ferroptosis inducer Erastin, ferroptosis inhibitor, and FUS knockdown were detected. Autophagy (LC3B), oxidative stress (GSH and ROS), and expression of NRF2/HO-1 pathway are indicators.  Results:   FUS was highly expressed in PRAD and phenomenally reduced the survival rate of patients. After knocking down FUS, the level of m6A methylation was significantly reduced, and the expressions of ferroptosis markers P53 and GPX4 were phenomenally reduced, while the levels of apoptosis and autophagy markers Caspase3 and LC3B remained unchanged. Upregulated and NRF2/HO-1 pathway indicators were upregulated. It shows that m6A methylation modification is reduced when FUS is the low expression, inhibits the expression of P53 and GPX4, downregulates GSH, upregulates ROS, activates the NRF2/HO-1 pathway, and promotes ferroptosis to inhibit the occurrence of RPAD.  Conclusions:   The increase of m6A methylation modification can increase the expression of FUS, thereby promoting the expression of P53 and GPX4, upregulating GSH, downregulating ROS, inhibiting the NRF2/HO-1 pathway, inhibiting ferroptosis, and promoting the growth of PRAD.""","""['Ning Wang', 'Ying Yu', 'Rongjiang Wang', 'Yu Chen', 'Jianer Tang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Math Methods Med""","""['Retracted: mRNA-Modified FUS/NRF2 Signalling Inhibits Ferroptosis and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'Berberine inhibits erastin-induced ferroptosis of mouse hippocampal neuronal cells possibly by activating the Nrf2-HO-1/GPX4 pathway.', 'Leonurine inhibits ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells by activating p62/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.', 'Icariin inhibits hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced ferroptosis of cardiomyocytes via regulation of the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway.', 'Nrf2 and Ferroptosis: A New Research Direction for Neurodegenerative Diseases.', 'Kelch-like ech-associated protein 1/nuclear factor E2-related factor 2/antioxidant response element pathway alleviates ferroptosis in sepsis by regulating oxidative stress.', 'Retracted: mRNA-Modified FUS/NRF2 Signalling Inhibits Ferroptosis and Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth.', 'Mechanism of ferroptosis in traditional chinese medicine for clinical treatment: A review.']"""

Moreover, the expression levels of the hub genes were positively correlated with neuroendocrine prostate cancer scores, which represent the degree of castration-resistant prostate cancer aggression.

Ferroptosis refers to an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death and is involved in prostate tumorigenesis. A few ferroptosis-related gene signatures have been developed to predict the prognosis for PCa patients. However, previous signatures were typically established based on biochemical recurrence-free survival, which has proven not to be a good surrogate for overall survival (OS). This study aimed to construct a novel ferroptosis-related gene prognostic index (FRGPI) to predict disease-free survival (DFS) and response to immunotherapy for PCa patients after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   Gene expression and clinicopathological data on PCa patients were obtained from the TCGA database. Ferroptosis-related hub genes associated with DFS of PCa patients were identified by an in-depth bioinformatics analysis using a novel and comprehensive algorithm based on functional enrichment, consensus clustering, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. The FRGPI was established on the basis of the genes selected using multivariate cox regression analysis and further validated in two additional PCa cohorts. Next, the clinicopathological, molecular, and immune profiles were characterized and compared between FRGPI-high and FRGPI-low subgroups. Finally, the predictive role of the FRGPI in response to immunotherapy was estimated using a metastatic urothelial cancer cohort treated with an anti-PD-L1 agent.  Results:   The FRGPI was constructed based on four genes (E2F1, CDC20, TYMS, and NUP85), and FRGPI-high patients had worse DFS than FRGPI-low patients. Multivariate cox regression analysis revealed that FRGPI could act as an independent prognostic factor for PCa patients after radical prostatectomy. A prognostic nomogram comprising the FRGPI and other clinicopathological parameters was established to predict the DFS for PCa patients quantitatively. In addition, comprehensive results demonstrated that high FRGPI scores showed a significantly positive correlation with worse clinicopathological features, higher mutation counts, increased frequency of copy number variations (CNVs), higher homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and immune scores, higher mRNAsi, and more importantly, enhanced sensitivity to immunotherapy.  Conclusions:   FRGPI is not only a promising and robust prognostic biomarker, but also a potential indicator of immunotherapeutic outcomes for PCa patients after radical prostatectomy.""","""['Yuliang Wang', 'Jiaqi Fan', 'Tao Chen', 'Lele Xu', 'Pengyu Liu', 'Lijia Xiao', 'Tao Wu', 'Qingchun Zhou', 'Qingyou Zheng', 'Chunxiao Liu', 'Franky Leung Chan', 'Dinglan Wu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['A Ferroptosis-Related Gene Prognostic Index to Predict Temozolomide Sensitivity and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Response for Glioma.', 'Ferroptosis-related gene signature predicts prognosis in kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma.', 'One Ferroptosis-Related Gene-Pair Signature Serves as an Original Prognostic Biomarker in Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Targeting the Macrophage-Ferroptosis Crosstalk: A Novel Insight into Tumor Immunotherapy.', 'The role of ferroptosis in prostate cancer: a novel therapeutic strategy.', 'Ferroptosis landscape in prostate cancer from molecular and metabolic perspective.', 'Identification of a novel senescence-associated signature to predict biochemical recurrence and immune microenvironment for prostate cancer.', 'IDH1 Promotes Foam Cell Formation by Aggravating Macrophage Ferroptosis.']"""

However, there is currently no comprehensive study of distinct ccCDKs in prostate cancer (PCa). The purpose of this study was to determine the value of ccCDK expression in predicting the prognosis of patients with PCa and to identify the gene functions of ccCDK in PCa.  Methods:   The UALCAN databases were analyzed to examine the expression of CDKs in prostate cancer. The Human Protein Atlas was used to verify the expression of CDKs online. Then, we assessed the prognostic values of CDKs using GEPIA. GeneMANIA and Metascape analyses were used to predict biological functions. We analyzed the mutation of CDKs by cBioPortal. The TIMER database was used to evaluate the correlation of CDKs and immune infiltration. The expression of CDKs in tissue was examined through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. After that, we focused on CDK3 and identified the expression of CDK3 by immunohistochemistry and western blot. The functions of CDK3 in C4-2 cell proliferation were determined by CCK-8 assays. C4-2 cells were tested for their ability to invade and migrate through transwell and wound healing assays.  Results:   The results showed that CDK1/3/4/5/6/16 was expressed at relatively higher levels in PCa tissues than in normal tissues. Patients with low expression of CDK1/3/5/16 exhibited significantly better disease-free survival than those with high expression. ccCDKs were enriched in the IL-18 signaling pathway and correlated with the infiltration of immune cells in PCa. Moreover, our cohort study data verified that there were significantly higher expression of CDK1/3/5/16 in PCa tissues compared to benign prostate hyperplasia tissues, and CDK3 was remarkably associated with a shorter progression-free survival for biochemical recurrence in PCa patients. CDK3 was positively expressed in PCa cells and tissues, and functional experiments demonstrated that silencing CDK3 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.  Conclusions:   Our study provides new evidence of ccCDKS in promoting PCa progression and implies that CDK3 may serve as an oncogene in PCa and may be valuable in the prognosis of biochemical recurrence in PCa patients.""","""['Yean Huang', 'Shuo Lu', 'Yi Chen', 'Yunhao Qing', 'Ruji Wu', 'Tan Ma', 'Zixiao Zhang', 'Yu Wang', 'Ke Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Heliyon""","""['Comprehensive Analysis of Role of Cyclin-Dependent Kinases Family Members in Colorectal Cancer.', 'CDK3, CDK5 and CDK8 Proteins as Prognostic and Potential Biomarkers in Colorectal Cancer Patients.', 'Deregulated expression of CDK2- or CDK3-associated kinase activities enhances c-Myc-induced apoptosis.', ""Evaluation of NOTCH family genes' expression and prognostic value in prostate cancer."", 'Targeting CDK1 in cancer: mechanisms and implications.']"""

Therefore, immunotherapy treatments could not be included in the treatment of prostate cancer until recently. Inadequate antitumoral response is one of the main reasons why tumor cells multiply rapidly and cause lethal results. It was shown that CD47 molecule, which is secreted at high levels by leukemia cells, reduces macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and thus facilitates escape from the antitumoral immune response. The aim of this study was to show don't eat me signaling in prostate carcinoma tissues and its relationship with macrophage polarization.  Materials and methods:   A total of 263 patients with a diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma after radical prostatectomy between 2015 and 2020 at our institute were included in the study. CD47, CD68, and CD163 expression levels were examined immunohistochemically (IHC) in these tissues. The relationship of these expression levels with unfavorable prognostic factors and survival for prostate carcinoma was investigated.  Results:   In this study, all the operated prostate carcinoma cases had CD47 expression in tumor tissue, but only 52.5% had a high level of expression. Of 263 prostate cancer tissues, 135 (51.3%) showed high expression of CD68 protein and 189 (71.9%) showed high expression of CD163 protein. There was a statistically strong relationship between CD47, CD68, and CD163.  Conclusions:   The CD47 molecule is basically a molecule that inhibits macrophage activation. CD68 is mostly used for macrophage classification, while CD163 is used for tumor-associated macrophage classification. Unlike others, we IHC examined CD47, CD68, and CD163 expressions in the surgical materials of patients who were operated for prostate carcinoma. In addition, we concluded that strong CD47 expression was closely associated with strong CD68 and CD163 expression in all tumor samples. However, a significant relationship between these expression levels and survival could not be demonstrated.""","""['Hüseyin S Semiz', 'Ülkü Küçük', 'Erdem Kısa', 'Merve Keskinkılıç', 'Dilara Ecem Süyün', 'Mehmet Emin Arayıcı', 'Elif Atağ', 'Aziz Karaoglu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Targeting CD47 in Anaplastic Thyroid Carcinoma Enhances Tumor Phagocytosis by Macrophages and Is a Promising Therapeutic Strategy.', 'Relationship between tumor-associated macrophage subsets and CD47 expression in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck in the tumor microenvironment.', 'Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals compartmental remodeling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells induced by anti-CD47 targeting in pancreatic cancer.', 'CD47 is a novel potent immunotherapy target in human malignancies: current studies and future promises.', 'Understanding the regulation of ""Don\'t Eat-Me"" signals by inflammatory signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment for more effective therapy.']"""

Remarkably, the relationship between age and the risk of ED has only been described in crude categories, such as risk for men aged 50-59 yr, without taking comorbidities into account.  Objective:   To understand how the risk of patient-reported ED varies according to age and comorbidity status.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cross-sectional study included a cohort of 17 250 patients with prostate cancer who completed the International Index of Erectile Function erectile function domain (IIEF-EF) questionnaire before any prostate treatment.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We created a logistic regression model to predict the probability of ED using age and comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension as predictors. We used age as a nonlinear term to allow a curvilinear relationship between age and ED.  Results and limitations:   The prevalence of patient-reported ED among men without any comorbidities increased from 10% to 79% from the age of 40 and 80 yr. The risk of ED increased sharply with comorbidity: the probability of ED for 50- and 75-yr-old individuals was 20% and 68% for healthy men, but 41% and 85% for those with hypertension, obesity, and diabetes. Men with several comorbidities have the same risk of ED as that of healthy men 15-25 yr older. Limitations include a healthier-than-average patient group and lack of information about some comorbidities and the severity of comorbidities.  Conclusions:   Our results allow us to better understand how the risk of ED changes with age and comorbidities. Further research should evaluate the impact of other risk factors not considered in the present study and should take risk factor severity into account.  Patient summary:   Our study shows how the probability of erectile dysfunction (ED) changes with increasing age, analyzed alone and when taking into account the presence of other risk factors for this condition (eg, diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease).

We present extended follow-up and an independent validation cohort of a prospective trial.  Methods and materials:   This study consists of 2 sequential single-arm phase-2 trials of patients with biochemical recurrence (prostate specific antigen [PSA] 0.4-3.0 ng/mL) and negative conventional imaging after radical prostatectomy and postoperative radiation therapy. All patients underwent [18F]DCFPyL positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Patients with molecularly defined oligorecurrent prostate cancer underwent MDT with stereotactic body radiation therapy or surgery, without androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The primary end point was biochemical response (≥50% PSA decline from baseline). Secondary end points included PSA progression-free survival and ADT-free survival. The sample size of 37 MDT patients was determined based on a Simon's 2-stage design with biochemical response rate >20%, and this design was also applied for the subsequent independent validation cohort.  Results:   Seventy-four patients underwent MDT: 37 each in the initial and validation cohorts. Both cohorts met the prespecified biochemical response rate and completed the planned 2-stages of accrual. For the pooled cohort, the median number of prostate specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography avid lesions was 2 and most (87%) recurrences were nodal. Sixty-four (87%) had stereotactic body radiation therapy and 10 (13%) had surgery. Median follow-up (interquartile range [IQR]) for the initial, validation and combined cohorts were 41 (35-46) months, 14 months (7-21), and 24 months (14-41), respectively. The biochemical response rates for the initial, validation and combined cohorts were 59%, 43%, and 51%, respectively. For the combined cohort, median biochemical progression-free survival was 21 months (95% confidence interval, 13-not reached), and median ADT-free survival was 45 months (95% confidence interval, 31-not reached).  Conclusions:   Half of patients treated with MDT for molecularly defined-only oligorecurrent prostate cancer exhibited a biochemical response.

This approach to therapy has limited the indications of simple orchidectomy to the removal of an atrophic testis and non-viable testis due to trauma, torsion, or infection. In contrast, radical orchidectomy uses a through the groin approach. It is the mainstay of diagnosis and treatment of testicular malignancies.
