The clinical implication of copy number change in advanced prostate cancer, which defines a wide spectrum of disease from high-risk localised to metastatic, is unknown.  Methods:   We performed copy number profiling on 688 tumour regions from 300 patients, who presented with advanced prostate cancer prior to the start of long-term androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), in the control arm of the prospective randomised STAMPEDE trial. Patients were categorised into metastatic states as follows; high-risk non-metastatic with or without local lymph node involvement, or metastatic low/high volume. We followed up patients for a median of 7 years. Univariable and multivariable Cox survival models were fitted to estimate the association between the burden of copy number alteration as a continuous variable and the hazard of death or disease progression.  Results:   The burden of copy number alterations positively associated with radiologically evident distant metastases at diagnosis (P=0.00006) and showed a non-linear relationship with clinical outcome on univariable and multivariable analysis, characterised by a sharp increase in the relative risk of progression (P=0.003) and death (P=0.045) for each unit increase, stabilising into more modest increases with higher copy number burdens. This association between copy number burden and outcome was similar in each metastatic state. Copy number loss occurred significantly more frequently than gain at the lowest copy number burden quartile (q=4.1 × 10-6). Loss of segments in chromosome 5q21-22 and gains at 8q21-24, respectively including CHD1 and cMYC occurred more frequently in cases with higher copy number alteration (for either region: Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, 0.5; adjusted P<0.0001). Copy number alterations showed variability across tumour regions in the same prostate. This variance associated with increased risk of distant metastases (Kruskal-Wallis test P=0.037).  Conclusions:   Copy number alteration in advanced prostate cancer associates with increased risk of metastases at diagnosis. Accumulation of a limited number of copy number alterations associates with most of the increased risk of disease progression and death. The increased likelihood of involvement of specific segments in high copy number alteration burden cancers may suggest an order underlying the accumulation of copy number changes.

Methods:   A total of 73 men with localized prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled and underwent focal HIFU followed by per-protocol PSA and mpMRI with systematic plus targeted biopsies at 12 months after treatment. We evaluated the association between post-treatment mpMRI and PSA with disease persistence on the post-ablation biopsy. We also assessed post-treatment functional and oncological outcomes.  Results:   Median age was 69 years (Interquartile Range (IQR): 66-74) and median PSA was 6.9 ng/dL (IQR: 5.3-9.9). Of 19 men with persistent GG ≥ 2 disease, 58% (11 men) had no visible lesions on MRI. In the 14 men with PIRADS 4 or 5 lesions, 7 (50%) had either no cancer or GG 1 cancer at biopsy.

The secondary objective is to evaluate the variables potentially related to the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Methods:   A post-authorization, nation-wide, multicenter, prospective, observational, and longitudinal study that included 416 patients treated with LHRHa between 2012 and 2017 is presented. Patients were followed for 3 years or until development of CRPC, thus completing a per-protocol population of 350 patients. A Cox regression analysis was carried out to evaluate factors involved in progression to CRPC.  Results:   After 3 years of treatment with LHRHa 18.2% of patients developed CRPC. In contrast, in the subgroup analysis, 39.6% of the metastatic patients developed CRPC, compared with 8.8% of the non-metastatic patients. The patients with the highest risk of developing CRPC were those with a nadir prostate-specific antigen (PSA) > 2 ng/ml (HR 21.6; 95% CI 11.7-39.8; p < 0.001) and those receiving concomitant medication, most commonly bicalutamide (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1-3.1, p = 0.0431).  Conclusions:   The proportion of metastatic patients developing CRPC after 3 years of treatment with LHRHa is consistent with what has been previously described in the literature. In addition, this study provides new findings on CRPC in non-metastatic patients.

However, there is a lack of profiling both epigenome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome for the same patients with PCa at different stages. This study aims to identify epitranscriptomic biomarkers screened in the peri-prostatic (PP) adipose tissue for predicting LPC and LAPC.  Methods:   We profiled gene expression and DNA methylation of 10 PCa patients' PP adipose tissue (4 LPC and 6 LAPC). Differential analysis was used to identify differentially methylated CpG sites and expressed genes. An integrative analysis of the microarray gene expression profiles and DNA methylation profiles was conducted using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) between each studied gene and the CpG sites in their promoter region. This epitranscriptomic signature was constructed by combining the association and differential analyses. The signature was then refined using the genetic mutation data of >1500 primary PCa and metastasis PCa samples from 4 different studies. We determined genes that were the most significantly affected by mutations. Machine learning models were built to evaluate the classification ability of the identified signature using the gene expression profiles from three external cohorts.  Results:   From the LASSO-based association analysis, we identified 56 genes presenting significant anti-correlation between the expression level and the methylation level of at least one CpG site in the promoter region (p-value<5 × 10-8). From the differential analysis, we detected 16,405 downregulated genes and 9485 genes containing at least one hypermethylated CpG site. We identified 30 genes that showed anti-correlation, down-regulation and hyper-methylation simultaneously. Using genetic mutation data, we determined that 6 of the 30 genes showed significant differences (adjusted p-value<0.05) in mutation frequencies between the primary PCa and metastasis PCa samples. The identified 30 genes performed well in distinguishing PCa patients with metastasis from PCa patient without metastasis (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81). The gene signature also performed well in distinguishing PCa patients with high risk of progression from PCa patients with low risk of progression (AUC = 0.88).  Conclusions:   We established an integrative framework to identify differentially expressed genes with an aberrant methylation pattern on PP adipose tissue that may represent novel candidate molecular markers for distinguishing between LPC and LAPC.""","""['Qian Liu', 'Madison Reed', 'Haiying Zhu', 'Yan Cheng', 'Joana Almeida', 'Gema Fruhbeck', 'Ricardo Ribeiro', 'Pingzhao Hu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Genomics""","""['Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.', 'Identification of new differentially methylated genes that have potential functional consequences in prostate cancer.', 'Identification of novel DNA-methylated genes that correlate with human prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Exploring targets of TET2-mediated methylation reprogramming as potential discriminators of prostate cancer progression.', 'Epigenome-Wide Association Study of Prostate Cancer in African Americans Identifies DNA Methylation Biomarkers for Aggressive Disease.', 'Transcriptome-Wide Association Analysis Identifies Novel Candidate Susceptibility Genes for Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels in Men Without Prostate Cancer.', 'DNA-methylation and genomic copy number in primary tumors and corresponding lymph node metastases in prostate cancer from patients with low and high Gleason score.', 'Evaluation of DNA Methylation Array for Glioma Tumor Profiling and Description of a Novel Epi-Signature to Distinguish IDH1/IDH2 Mutant and Wild-Type Tumors.']"""

We evaluated PCa incidence among men with PSA below 3 ng/mL and no PCa diagnosis at the first screening round of the Finnish Randomized Study of Screening for PCa. Follow-up started at the first screening attendance and ended at PCa diagnosis, emigration, death or the common closing date (December 2016), whichever came first. Cox regression analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios and their confidence intervals (CI). Among men with PSA <3 ng/mL, cumulative PCa incidence was 9.1% after 17.6 years median follow-up. Cumulative incidence was 3.6% among men with baseline PSA 0 to 0.99 ng/mL, 11.5% in those with PSA 1.0 to 1.99 ng/mL and 25.7% among men with PSA 2 to 2.99 ng/mL (hazard ratio 9.0, 95% CI: 7.9-10.2 for the latter). The differences by PSA level were most striking for low-risk disease based on Gleason score and EAU risk group. PSA values <1 ng/mL indicate a very low 20-year risk, while at PSA 2 to 2.99 ng/mL risks are materially higher, with 4- to 5-fold risk for aggressive disease. Using risk-stratification and appropriate rescreening intervals will reduce screening intensity and overdetection. Using cumulative incidence of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) as the criterion, rescreening intervals could range from approximately 3 years for men with initial PSA 2 to 2.99 ng/mL, 6 years for men with PSA 1 to 1.99 ng/mL to 10 years for men with PSA <1 ng/mL.""","""['Idris Olasunmbo Ola', 'Kirsi Talala', 'Teuvo Tammela', 'Kimmo Taari', 'Teemu Murtola', 'Paula Kujala', 'Jani Raitanen', 'Anssi Auvinen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'A ""PSA pyramid"" for men with initial prostate-specific antigen ≤3 ng/ml: a plea for individualized prostate cancer screening.', 'Is further screening of men with baseline PSA\u2009<\u20091 ng\xa0ml(-1) worthwhile?

Risk for cancer overall and for each type of malignancy was compared to the United States (US) population using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Natural history of gammopathy was determined through assessing the progression from a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM). Risk for hematological malignancies was more than four times higher than expected compared to the general population: non-Hodgkin lymphoma was approximately three times higher; MM was approximately nine times higher. Age-specific incidence rates of MGUS were unexpectedly high among younger patients. The 10-year cumulative incidence of MM after diagnosis of MGUS was 7.9%, comparable to the general population. Compared to the general US population, GD1 patients were at higher risk for solid malignancies of liver (2.9 times), kidney (2.8 times), melanoma (2.5 times), and breast (1.4 times). Colorectal, prostate, and lung cancer risks were lower than expected.

Mortality from prostate cancer is largely from metastatic disease, reflecting on the great strides in the last century of treatments in care for the localized disease. Metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) will commonly travel to the bone, creating unique bone pathology that requires nuanced treatments in those sites with surgical, radio and chemotherapeutic interventions. The bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway has been historically studied in the capacity to regulate the osteogenic nature of new bone. New mineralized bone generation is a frequent and common observation in mCRPC and referred to as blastic bone lesions. Less common are bone destructive lesions that are termed lytic.  Methods:   We queried the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) prostate cancer databases for the expression of the BMP pathway and found that distinct gene expression of the ligands, soluble antagonists, receptors, and intracellular mediators were altered in localized versus metastatic disease. Human prostate cancer cell lines have an innate ability to promote blastic- or lytic-like bone lesions and we hypothesized that inhibiting BMP signaling in these cell lines would result in a distinct change in osteogenesis gene expression with BMP inhibition.  Results:   We found unique and common changes by comparing these cell lines response and unique BMP pathway alterations. We treated human PCa cell lines with distinct bone pathologic phenotypes with the BMP inhibitor DMH1 and found distinct osteogenesis responses.

However, low patient response rates and dose-limiting toxicity are the major limitations of immunotherapy. Nanoparticle-based photothermal immunotherapy can amplify antitumor immune responses, although poor tumor penetration depth of near-infrared radiation (NIR) and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment significantly dampen its effects. We designed a nanoplatform based on gold nanorods for NIR-II-mediated photothermal therapy (PTT) combined with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase inhibition to achieve enhanced photothermal immunotherapy against prostate cancer. The GNRs were assembled layer by layer with polystyrenesulfonate as the interconnecting layer and then coated with a cationic polymer of γ-cyclodextrin (CD)-cross-linked low-molecular-weight polyethylenimine that was conjugated to an 8-mer peptide targeting the prostate tumor-specific gastrin-releasing peptide receptor. The m6A RNA demethylase inhibitor meclofenamic acid (MA) was then loaded into the CD cavity through hydrophobic interactions. GNR-CDP8MA specifically targeted the prostate tumor cells and selectively accumulated at the tumor site in vivo. In addition, GNR-CDP8MA almost completely ablated prostate cancer cell-derived tumors upon 1208 nm laser irradiation. Mechanistically, NIR-II triggered the release of MA from GNR-CDP8MA, which increased global mRNA m6A methylation and decreased the stability of PDL1 transcripts. Furthermore, GNR-CDP8MA-mediated PTT-induced immunogenic cell death in the primary tumor and consequently enhanced antitumor immunity by activating the antigen-presenting dendritic cells and tumor-specific effector T cells in the metastatic tumors. This study offers insights into synergistic m6A RNA methylation and PTT as an effective strategy for cancer immunotherapy.""","""['Jianhua Liu', 'Yue Song', 'Yiqiao Wang', 'Mingda Han', 'Chunxi Wang', 'Fei Yan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['A biomimetic nanoplatform for precise reprogramming of tumor-associated macrophages and NIR-II mediated antitumor immune activation.', 'A dual-targeted hyaluronic acid-gold nanorod platform with triple-stimuli responsiveness for photodynamic/photothermal therapy of breast cancer.', 'Photothermal therapy mediated by gold nanocages composed of anti-PDL1 and galunisertib for improved synergistic immunotherapy in colorectal cancer.', 'Recent Advances in Engineering Nanomedicines for Second Near-Infrared Photothermal-Combinational Immunotherapy.', 'A Polymer Multicellular Nanoengager for Synergistic NIR-II Photothermal Immunotherapy.', 'Application of Cyclodextrin for Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'The emerging roles and mechanism of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications in urologic tumours progression.', 'A Gold Nanocage Probe Targeting Survivin for the Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'The Role of Cyclodextrin in the Construction of Nanoplatforms: From Structure, Function and Application Perspectives.', 'Recent Development of Supramolecular Cancer Theranostics Based on Cyclodextrins: A Review.']"""

Nevertheless, the performance of genomic classifiers to risk classify African American men is thus far lacking in a prospective setting.  Methods:   This is a prospective study of the Decipher genomic classifier for National Comprehensive Cancer Network low- and intermediate-risk PCa. Study-eligible non-African American men were matched to African American men. Diagnostic biopsy specimens were processed to estimate Decipher scores. Samples accrued in NCT02723734, a prospective study, were interrogated to determine the genomic risk of reclassification (GrR) between conventional clinical risk classifiers and the Decipher score.  Results:   The final analysis included a clinically balanced cohort of 226 patients with complete genomic information (113 African American men and 113 non-African American men). A higher proportion of African American men with National Comprehensive Cancer Network-classified low-risk (18.2%) and favorable intermediate-risk (37.8%) PCa had a higher Decipher score than non-African American men. Self-identified African American men were twice more likely than non-African American men to experience GrR (relative risk [RR] = 2.23, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02 to 4.90; P = .04). In an ancestry-determined race model, we consistently validated a higher risk of reclassification in African American men (RR = 5.26, 95% CI = 1.66 to 16.63; P = .004). Race-stratified analysis of GrR vs non-GrR tumors also revealed molecular differences in these tumor subtypes.  Conclusions:   Integration of genomic classifiers with clinically based risk classification can help identify the subset of African American men with localized PCa who harbor high genomic risk of early metastatic disease. It is vital to identify and appropriately risk stratify the subset of African American men with aggressive disease who may benefit from more targeted interventions.""","""['Shivanshu Awasthi', 'G Daniel Grass', 'Javier Torres-Roca', 'Peter A S Johnstone', 'Julio Pow-Sang', 'Jasreman Dhillon', 'Jong Park', 'Robert J Rounbehler', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Alex Hakansson', 'Yang Liu', 'Angelina K Fink', 'Amanda DeRenzis', 'Jordan H Creed', 'Michael Poch', 'Roger Li', 'Brandon Manley', 'Daniel Fernandez', 'Arash Naghavi', 'Kenneth Gage', 'Grace Lu-Yao', 'Evangelia Katsoulakis', 'Ryan J Burri', 'Andrew Leone', 'Cesar E Ercole', 'Joshua D Palmer', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Curtiland Deville', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Adam P Dicker', 'William Kelly', 'Kosj Yamoah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""['African American Race is Not Associated with Risk of Reclassification during Active Surveillance: Results from the Canary Prostate Cancer Active Surveillance Study.', 'Combined value of validated clinical and genomic risk stratification tools for predicting prostate cancer mortality in a high-risk prostatectomy cohort.', 'A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'Is active surveillance a suitable option for African American men with prostate cancer?

After gain-of-function and loss-of-function models were established, the changes in cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assay, and Transwell experiments. Validation of the targeting relationships between plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 and miR-515-5p, and between miR-515-5p and high mobility group B3 was conducted using bioinformatics prediction, a dual-luciferase reporter assay, and an RNA immunoprecipitation experiment. Moreover, the effects of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 and miR-515-5p on high mobility group B3 protein expression were examined using Western blot.  Results:   Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 expression and high mobility group B3 expression were up-regulated in prostate cancer tissues and cell lines while miR-515-5p expression was down-regulated.

One mechanism of osteoblast expansion is the transdifferentiation of bone marrow endothelial cells. Prostate cancer cells contribute several secreted factors, including bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), to the microenvironment that support osteoblastic transdifferentiation. In this issue of Cancer Research, Yu and colleagues share their findings of how BMP-mediated endothelial conversion can be inhibited by treatment with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) agonists. Using agonists like the all-trans retinoic acid or palovarotene, the authors demonstrated the role of the interaction of BMP-activated SMAD1 with RARγ for osteoblastic differentiation. RARγ agonists potentiated the proteasomal degradation of the Smad1-RARγ complex, blocking BMP signaling. Because palovarotene is clinically effective in the treatment of aberrant bone formation found in fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, its repurposing for the treatment of osteoblastic cancer metastasis is promising. However, patient selection and dose-finding studies will be critical for the translation of these findings to complement standard of care for patients with bone metastatic prostate cancer.

Clinical studies of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), targeting prostate inflammation patients with symptomatic BPH have demonstrated conflicting results, with some studies demonstrating symptom improvement and others showing no impact. Thus, understanding the role of the cyclooxygenases in BPH and prostatic inflammation is important.  Methods:   The expression of COX-1 was analyzed in a cohort of donors and BPH patients by immunohistochemistry and compared to previously determined characteristics for this same cohort. The impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on COX-1 and COX-2 was determined in experiments treating human benign prostate epithelial cell lines BPH-1 and RWPE-1 with rotenone and MitoQ. RWPE-1 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA specific to complex 1 gene NDUFS3.  Results:   COX-1 expression was increased in the epithelial cells of BPH specimens compared to young healthy organ donor and normal prostate adjacent to BPH and frequently co-occurred with COX-2 alteration in BPH patients. COX-1 immunostaining was associated with the presence of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, but was not associated with age, prostate size, COX-2 or the presence of CD4+, CD20+ or CD68+ inflammatory cells. In cell line studies, COX protein levels were elevated following treatment with inhibitors of mitochondrial function. MitoQ significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in RWPE-1 cells. Knockdown of NDUFS3 stimulated COX-1 expression.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest COX-1 is elevated in BPH epithelial cells and is associated with increased presence of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells. COX-1 can be induced in benign prostate epithelial cells in response to mitochondrial complex I inhibition, and knockdown of the complex 1 protein NDUFS3. COX-1 and mitochondrial dysfunction may play more of a role than previously recognized in the development of age-related benign prostatic disease.""","""['Chandler N Hudson', 'Kai He', 'Laura E Pascal', 'Teresa Liu', 'Livianna K Myklebust', 'Rajiv Dhir', 'Pooja Srivastava', 'Naoki Yoshimura', 'Zhou Wang', 'William A Ricke', 'Donald B DeFranco']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Am J Clin Exp Urol""","""['E-cadherin expression is inversely correlated with aging and inflammation in the prostate.', 'Claudin-1 down-regulation in the prostate is associated with aging and increased infiltration of inflammatory cells in BPH.', 'Tight junction protein claudin-1 is downregulated by TGF-β1 via MEK signaling in benign prostatic epithelial cells.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.', 'Could inflammation be a key component in the progression of benign prostatic hyperplasia?', 'The Lack of Standardization and Pharmacological Effect Limits the Potential Clinical Usefulness of Phytosterols in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.']"""

Our study aims to investigate whether the gut microbiota could be recovered after a single dose of oral co-amoxiclav before transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal prostate biopsy (TPPBx) in 5 weeks' time.  Methods:   Fifteen patients with elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were recruited to provide pre-antibiotic and post-antibiotic fecal samples. The V4 region of 16S rRNA was sequenced. Analysis was performed by QIIME2. Alpha- and beta-diversities were analyzed, as well as the differential enrichment by Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis.  Results:   Both the alpha- and beta-diversities of the pre- and post-antibiotic fecal samples were significantly different. Genera that are associated with alleviation of inflammation were enriched in the pre-antibiotic fecal samples, while the inflammation-associated genera were more enriched in the post-antibiotic fecal samples.  Conclusion:   A single dose of oral co-amoxiclav before TPPBx could have led to a change of gut microbiota that cannot be recovered in 5 weeks' time.

Both Miro1 and Miro2 have roles in promoting neuron function, but recently Miro2 has been shown to have additional roles in response to nutrient starvation in tumor cells. Miro1 and 2 consist of two small GTPase domains flanking a pair of EF-hands. The N-terminal GTPase (nGTPase) domain is responsible for initiating mitochondrial trafficking and interactions with GCN1 in prostate cancer. The crystal structure of Miro1 nGTPase bound to GTP has been solved. However, no structural data is available for the nGTPase domain of Miro2. To better understand the similarities and differences in the functions of Miro1 and Miro2, we have initiated structural studies of Miro2. Here we report the backbone NMR chemical shift assignments of a 22 KDa construct of the nGTPase domain of Miro2 bound to GTP that includes residues 1-180 of the full-length protein.

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating HLA-I loss in prostate cancer have not been fully explored. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of HLA-I genomic, epigenomic and gene expression alterations in primary and metastatic human prostate cancer. Loss of HLA-I gene expression was associated with repressive chromatin states including DNA methylation, histone H3 tri-methylation at lysine 27, and reduced chromatin accessibility. Pharmacological DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition decreased DNA methylation and increased H3 lysine 27 acetylation and resulted in re-expression of HLA-I on the surface of tumor cells. Re-expression of HLA-I on LNCaP cells by DNMT and HDAC inhibition increased activation of co-cultured prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA)27-38-specific CD8+ T-cells. HLA-I expression is epigenetically regulated by functionally reversible DNA methylation and chromatin modifications in human prostate cancer.

Although multiple signaling pathways modulated by ivermectin have been identified in tumor cells, few studies have focused on the exact target of ivermectin. Herein, we report the pharmacological effects and targets of ivermectin in prostate cancer. Ivermectin caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, induced cell apoptosis and DNA damage, and decreased androgen receptor (AR) signaling in prostate cancer cells. Further in vivo analysis showed ivermectin could suppress 22RV1 xenograft progression. Using integrated omics profiling, including RNA-seq and thermal proteome profiling, the forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair executer Ku70/Ku80 were strongly suggested as direct targets of ivermectin in prostate cancer. The interaction of ivermectin and FOXA1 reduced the chromatin accessibility of AR signaling and the G0/G1 cell cycle regulator E2F1, leading to cell proliferation inhibition. The interaction of ivermectin and Ku70/Ku80 impaired the NHEJ repair ability. Cooperating with the downregulation of homologous recombination repair ability after AR signaling inhibition, ivermectin increased intracellular DNA double-strand breaks and finally triggered cell death.

Approximately 15-20% of RMS cases arise from the bladder and prostate (B/P). The optimal treatment strategy for B/P RMS remains unclear.  Objective:   To retrospectively evaluate the applicability of our procedure performed to treat paediatric patients with B/P RMS.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is a retrospective analysis from a single tertiary referral hospital. From August 2003 to March 2021, 62 children pathologically diagnosed with B/P RMS underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic detaenial sigmoid neobladder reconstruction in our centre.  Surgical procedure:   Surgical procedures included laparoscopic radical cystectomy and detaenial sigmoid neobladder reconstruction, which is demonstrated in the accompanying video.  Measurements:   Demographic, clinical, and follow-up data were collected. Perioperative and long-term oncological and functional outcomes were reported. A logistic regression analysis was also performed.  Results and limitations:   All surgeries, including three intracorporeal laparoscopic surgeries, were completed successfully. Of the 62 patients, 54 were alive without evidence of disease recurrence or metastasis at the last follow-up. Five of the 14 >12-yr-old boys reported that they experienced erections. Two female patients >12 yr old reported that they menstruated. However, this was a retrospective study conducted at a single centre with limited surgeon experience.  Conclusions:   Our results confirmed the safety and feasibility of primary orthotopic sigmoid neobladder reconstruction after radical cystectomy for paediatric patients with B/P RMS. Good outcomes in terms of oncological control and functional recovery were achieved. The high histocompatibility and tissue adaptability of children are inspiring.

We aimed to determine these effects in a collaborative individual patient data meta-analysis of randomised trials of these treatments.  Methods:   In this meta-analysis, we identified relevant trials of patients with Marfan syndrome by systematically searching MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL from database inception to Nov 2, 2021. Trials were eligible if they involved a randomised comparison of an ARB versus control or an ARB versus β blocker. We used individual patient data from patients with no prior aortic surgery to estimate the effects of: ARB versus control (placebo or open control); ARB versus β blocker; and indirectly, β blocker versus control. The primary endpoint was the annual rate of change of body surface area-adjusted aortic root dimension Z score, measured at the sinuses of Valsalva.  Findings:   We identified ten potentially eligible trials including 1836 patients from our search, from which seven trials and 1442 patients were eligible for inclusion in our main analyses. Four trials involving 676 eligible participants compared ARB with control. During a median follow-up of 3 years, allocation to ARB approximately halved the annual rate of change in the aortic root Z score (mean annual increase 0·07 [SE 0·02] ARB vs 0·13 [SE 0·02] control; absolute difference -0·07 [95% CI -0·12 to -0·01]; p=0·012). Prespecified secondary subgroup analyses showed that the effects of ARB were particularly large in those with pathogenic variants in fibrillin-1, compared with those without such variants (heterogeneity p=0·0050), and there was no evidence to suggest that the effect of ARB varied with β-blocker use (heterogeneity p=0·54). Three trials involving 766 eligible participants compared ARBs with β blockers. During a median follow-up of 3 years, the annual change in the aortic root Z score was similar in the two groups (annual increase -0·08 [SE 0·03] in ARB groups vs -0·11 [SE 0·02] in β-blocker groups; absolute difference 0·03 [95% CI -0·05 to 0·10]; p=0·48). Thus, indirectly, the difference in the annual change in the aortic root Z score between β blockers and control was -0·09 (95% CI -0·18 to 0·00; p=0·042).  Interpretation:   In people with Marfan syndrome and no previous aortic surgery, ARBs reduced the rate of increase of the aortic root Z score by about one half, including among those taking a β blocker. The effects of β blockers were similar to those of ARBs. Assuming additivity, combination therapy with both ARBs and β blockers from the time of diagnosis would provide even greater reductions in the rate of aortic enlargement than either treatment alone, which, if maintained over a number of years, would be expected to lead to a delay in the need for aortic surgery.

Most deep learning approaches address these challenges by enhancing their learning capability through a substantial increase in trainable parameters within their models. An increased model complexity will incur high computational costs and large memory requirements unsuitable for real-time implementation on standard clinical workstations, as clinical imaging systems typically have low-end computer hardware with limited memory and CPU resources only. This paper presents a compact convolutional neural network (CAN3D) designed specifically for clinical workstations and allows the segmentation of large 3D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images in real-time. The proposed CAN3D has a shallow memory footprint to reduce the number of model parameters and computer memory required for state-of-the-art performance and maintain data integrity by directly processing large full-size 3D image input volumes with no patches required. The proposed architecture significantly reduces computational costs, especially for inference using the CPU. We also develop a novel loss function with extra shape constraints to improve segmentation accuracy for imbalanced classes in 3D MR images. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches (U-Net3D, improved U-Net3D and V-Net), CAN3D reduced the number of parameters up to two orders of magnitude and achieved much faster inference, up to 5 times when predicting with a standard commercial CPU (instead of GPU). For the open-access OAI-ZIB knee MR dataset, in comparison with manual segmentation, CAN3D achieved Dice coefficient values of (mean = 0.87 ± 0.02 and 0.85 ± 0.04) with mean surface distance errors (mean = 0.36 ± 0.32 mm and 0.29 ± 0.10 mm) for imbalanced classes such as (femoral and tibial) cartilage volumes respectively when training volume-wise under only 12G video memory.

More recently, nanobubbles (NBs) have been proposed as novel ultrasound contrast agents. Unlike MBs, which are intravascular ultrasound contrast agents, the smaller diameter of NBs allows them to cross the vessel wall and target specific receptors on cancer cells such as the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). It has been demonstrated that PSMA-targeted NBs can bind to the receptors of PCa cells and show a prolonged retention effect in dual-tumor mice models. However, the analysis of the prolonged retention effect has so far been limited to qualitative or semi-quantitative approaches.  Methods:   This work introduces two pharmacokinetics models for quantitative analysis of time-intensity curves (TICs) obtained from the CEUS loops. The first model is based on describing the vascular input by the modified local density random walk (mLDRW) model and independently interprets TICs from each tumor lesion. Differently, the second model is based on the reference-tissue model, previously proposed in the context of nuclear imaging, and describes the binding kinetics of an indicator in a target tissue by using a reference tissue where binding does not occur.  Results:   Our results show that four estimated parameters, β, β / λ $\beta /\lambda $ , β + / β - ${\beta }_ + /{\beta }_ - $ , for the mLDRW-input model, and γ for the reference-based model, were significantly different (p-value <0.05) between free NBs and PSMA-NBs. These parameters estimated by the two models demonstrate different behaviors between PSMA-targeted and free NBs.  Conclusions:   These promising results encourage further quantitative analysis of targeted NBs for improved cancer diagnostics and characterization.""","""['Chuan Chen', 'Reshani Perera', 'Michael C Kolios', 'Hessel Wijkstra', 'Massimo Mischi', 'Agata A Exner', 'Simona Turco']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Optimized Anti-Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Single-Chain Variable Fragment-Loaded Nanobubbles as a Novel Targeted Ultrasound Contrast Agent for the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeted Nanobubbles Carrying Indocyanine Green for Ultrasound, Photoacoustic and Fluorescence Imaging of Prostate Cancer.', 'Real time ultrasound molecular imaging of prostate cancer with PSMA-targeted nanobubbles.', 'Multifunctional microbubbles and nanobubbles for photoacoustic imaging.', 'Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Quantification: From Kinetic Modeling to Machine Learning.']"""

Methods:   In this study, a total of 46 bone scans from 12 patients with prostate cancer treated for bone metastases with Radium-223 were included. Whole-body planar images were obtained 150-180 min after an intravenous injection of 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate, and cervical-to-pelvic SPECT/CT was immediately obtained. The total bone volume (TBV) and regional metabolic bone volume (MBV) were defined as Hounsfield unit of > 120, standardized uptake value (SUV) of > 0.5, and SUV of > 5-8 in four levels, respectively. Bone metabolism volumetric index (BMVI) was calculated as the percentage of the total MBV divided by TBV. The variability of the TBV measurement was evaluated by the percentage coefficient of variance (%CV) of TBV within individual patients. We evaluated the correlation of TBV with age, height, weight, and body mass index and the correlation and agreement between BSI and BMVI.  Results:   The mean and %CV of TBV were 4661.7 cm3 and 2.8%, respectively, and TBV was strongly correlated with body weight. BMVI was significantly higher than BSI and correlated with alkaline phosphatase. For patients with progressive bone metastases, BSI was clearly underestimated, whereas BMVI was elevated.  Conclusions:   Although assessed in a small number of cases, the new index for assessing the extent of bone disease using SPECT/CT imaging was highly value than BSI and was significantly correlated with alkaline phosphatase. Therefore, this study suggests that BMVI could improve the low sensitivity of BSI in patients with low extent of disease grade.""","""['Hajime Ichikawa', 'Takayuki Shibutani', 'Masahisa Onoguchi', 'Yuki Taniguchi']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Ann Nucl Med""","""['Evaluation of bone metastatic burden by bone SPECT/CT in metastatic prostate cancer patients: defining threshold value for total bone uptake and assessment in radium-223 treated patients.', 'Evaluation of bone metastasis burden as an imaging biomarker by quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography for assessing prostate cancer with bone metastasis: a phantom and clinical study.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Bone scintigraphy and the added value of SPECT (single photon emission tomography) in detecting skeletal lesions.', '18F-NaF-PET/CT and 99mTc-MDP Bone Scintigraphy in the Detection of Bone Metastases in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Abnormal activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway has been implicated in a variety of human cancers. Hyper-activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway has been found to lead to tumor survival, anti-apoptosis and invasion in the development of prostate cancer. In the present work, we identified Lycorine as a potent NF-κB inhibitor using a NF-κB activity dependent luciferase reporter in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cells. With this reporter gene assay, we found that Lycorine significantly suppressed the constitutive NF-κB activity as well as the NF-κB activity induced by TNF-α, LPS, PMA and IL-1β. Western blotting analysis of the NF-κB signaling pathway further showed that Lycorine inhibited IκB-α (inhibitor of κB) phosphorylation, IκB-α degradation, and p65 phosphorylation. Consistent with this, the subsequent nuclear translocation of p65 was blocked by Lycorine as evidenced in the immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. Furthermore, we observed that cell cycle was arrested at G2/M in Lycorine treated cells using FACS analysis. Western blotting analysis indicated that Lycorine increased the expression of Cyclin D1 but decreased the expression of p21. In addition, FACS analysis showed that Lycorine induced apoptosis in DU145 and PC3 cells. Western blotting analysis revealed that Lycorine decreased the expression of anti-apoptosis genes myc, survivin and Bcl-2 while increased cleavage of PARP. Finally, we observed a significant anticancer effect of Lycorine in a RM-1 prostate cancer xenograft mouse model. In agreement with its in vitro anticancer effect, Lycorine inhibited p65 phosphorylation, IKK-β phosphorylation and the expression of Ki-67, while increased the cleavage of Caspase 3 in tumor tissue. Taken together, our data demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo anti-prostate cancer activity of Lycorine by inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway, and highlighted it as a lead compound for further development into an effective anticancer drug.""","""['Jie Liu', 'Shengjun Sun', 'Cheng Zhou', 'Zhihong Sun', 'Qin Wang', 'Chengming Sun']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer""","""['Suppression of constitutive and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and induction of apoptosis by apigenin in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells: correlation with down-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes.', 'PMS1077 sensitizes TNF-α induced apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells by blocking NF-κB signaling pathway.', 'Retigeric acid B exhibits antitumor activity through suppression of nuclear factor-κB signaling in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) down-regulates expression of cell proliferation and antiapoptotic and metastatic gene products through suppression of IkappaBalpha kinase and Akt activation.', 'The role of IKK in constitutive activation of NF-kappaB transcription factor in prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Alleviating effect of lycorine on CFA‑induced arthritic pain via inhibition of spinal inflammation and oxidative stress.', 'Role of Metabolism and Metabolic Pathways in Prostate Cancer.']"""

We demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-6-mediated AR-V7 expression requires bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and CD105 receptor activity in both PCa and associated fibroblasts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation supported CD105-dependent ID1- and E2F-mediated expression of RBM38. Further, RNA immune precipitation demonstrated RBM38 binds the AR-cryptic exon 3 to enable AR-V7 generation. The forced expression of AR-V7 by primary prostatic fibroblasts diminished PCa sensitivity to ARSI. Conversely, downregulation of AR-V7 expression in cancer epithelia and associated fibroblasts was achieved by a CD105-neutralizing antibody, carotuximab. These compelling pre-clinical findings initiated an interventional study in PCa patients developing ARSI resistance. The combination of carotuximab and ARSI (i.e., enzalutamide or abiraterone) provided disease stabilization in four of nine assessable ARSI-refractory patients. Circulating tumor cell evaluation showed AR-V7 downregulation in the responsive subjects on combination treatment and revealed a three-gene panel that was predictive of response.

Image-guidance techniques could improve the safety and diagnostic yield of biopsy collection as well as increase the efficacy of radiotherapy.  Aim:   To estimate the accuracy of PCa detection using in situ Raman spectroscopy (RS) in a pilot in-human clinical study and assess biochemical differences between in vivo and ex vivo measurements.  Approach:   A new miniature RS fiber-optics system equipped with an electromagnetic (EM) tracker was guided by trans-rectal ultrasound-guided imaging, fused with preoperative magnetic resonance imaging to acquire 49 spectra in situ (in vivo) from 18 PCa patients. In addition, 179 spectra were acquired ex vivo in fresh prostate samples from 14 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. Two machine-learning models were trained to discriminate cancer from normal prostate tissue from both in situ and ex vivo datasets.  Results:   A support vector machine (SVM) model was trained on the in situ dataset and its performance was evaluated using leave-one-patient-out cross validation from 28 normal prostate measurements and 21 in-tumor measurements. The model performed at 86% sensitivity and 72% specificity. Similarly, an SVM model was trained with the ex vivo dataset from 152 normal prostate measurements and 27 tumor measurements showing reduced cancer detection performance mostly attributable to spatial registration inaccuracies between probe measurements and histology assessment. A qualitative comparison between in situ and ex vivo measurements demonstrated a one-to-one correspondence and similar ratios between the main Raman bands (e.g., amide I-II bands, phenylalanine).

The antiproliferative effect of CIP was examined through employing MTT, colony formation, and 3D culture assays. DU145/DOX20 cells exhibited a twofold higher IC50 value for DOX, an increased ABCB1 transporter activity, and some morphological changes accompanied by a decrease in spheroid size, adhesive and migration potential compared to DU145 cells. CIP (5 and 25 µg mL-1) resulted in a higher reduction in the viability of DU145/DOX20 cells than in DU145 cells. DU145/DOX20 cells were more resistant to CIP in 3D culture compared to the 2D one. No spheroid formation was observed for DU145/DOX20 cells treated with DOX and CIP combination. CIP and DOX, alone or in combination, significantly reduced the growth of DU145 spheroids. CIP in combination with 20 nM DOX prevented the colony formation of DU145 cells. The clonogenicity of DU145/DOX20 cells could not be estimated due to their low adhesive potential. CIP alone caused a significant reduction in the migration of DU145 cells and resulted in a more severe decrease in the wound closure ability of DOX-exposed ones. We identified that CIP enhanced DOX sensitivity in DU145 and DU145/DOX20 cells.

In prostate cancer, CWAS identified regulatory elements and androgen receptor-binding sites that explained the association at 52 of 98 known prostate cancer risk loci and discovered 17 additional risk loci. CWAS implicated key developmental transcription factors in prostate cancer risk that are overlooked by eQTL-based approaches due to context-dependent gene regulation. We experimentally validated associations and demonstrated the extensibility of CWAS to additional epigenomic datasets and phenotypes, including response to prostate cancer treatment. CWAS is a powerful and biologically interpretable paradigm for studying variants that influence traits by affecting transcriptional regulation.""","""['Sylvan C Baca', 'Cassandra Singler', 'Soumya Zacharia', 'Ji-Heui Seo', 'Tunc Morova', 'Faraz Hach', 'Yi Ding', 'Tommer Schwarz', 'Chia-Chi Flora Huang', 'Jacob Anderson', 'André P Fay', 'Cynthia Kalita', 'Stefan Groha', 'Mark M Pomerantz', 'Victoria Wang', 'Simon Linder', 'Christopher J Sweeney', 'Wilbert Zwart', 'Nathan A Lack', 'Bogdan Pasaniuc', 'David Y Takeda', 'Alexander Gusev', 'Matthew L Freedman']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Nat Genet""","""['Variants at IRX4 as prostate cancer expression quantitative trait loci.', 'DNA methylation and cis-regulation of gene expression by prostate cancer risk SNPs.', 'Bromodomain protein 4 discriminates tissue-specific super-enhancers containing disease-specific susceptibility loci in prostate and breast cancer.', 'Mechanistic insights into genetic susceptibility to prostate cancer.', 'Expression Quantitative Trait Loci Information Improves Predictive Modeling of Disease Relevance of Non-Coding Genetic Variation.', 'Inferring cell-type-specific causal gene regulatory networks during human neurogenesis.', 'Novel insight into the etiology of ischemic stroke gained by integrative transcriptome-wide association study.', 'Epigenomic charting and functional annotation of risk loci in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Optimized high-throughput screening of non-coding variants identified from genome-wide association studies.', 'The missing link between genetic association and regulatory function.']"""

A model based on four-kallikrein markers in blood (commercialized as 4Kscore) predicts risk of Grade group 2 or higher prostate cancer at biopsy, reducing unnecessary biopsies. We assessed whether these results extend to a single institution prostate biopsy cohort of Danish men and are enhanced by three microRNAs from urine (referred to as uCaP). The 4Kscore measured in cryopreserved blood from 234 men referred for 10+ core biopsy to Aarhus University Hospital, 29 with PSA &gt; 25 ng/ml. We explored uCaP in urine from 157 of these men. Combined with age and DRE findings, both 4Kscore and uCaP could accurately predict Grade group 2 or higher prostate cancer (all patients: AUC = 0.802 and 0.797; PSA ≤ 25: AUC = 0.763 and 0.759). There was no additive effect when combining the 4Kscore and uCaP. Limitations include a study cohort with higher risk than commonly reported for biopsy cohorts.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and Erlotinib (Erlo) are two drugs, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat cancer, but their use is limited in terms of the toxicity of ATO and the low solubility of Erlo. This study aimed to prepare arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-decorated nanoliposomes (NLPs) containing Erlo and ATO (NLPs-ATO-Erlo-RGD) to increase the solubility and reduce the toxicity of Erlo and ATO for cancer treatment. The results of transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering showed that NLPs were synthesized uniformly, with spherical shape morphology and particle sizes between 140 and 160 nm. High-performance liquid chromatography and ICP-MS results showed that about 90% of the drug was loaded in the NLPs. In comparison with NLPs-ATO-Erlo, NLPs-ATO-Erlo-RGD demonstrated considerable toxicity against the αvβ3 overexpressing PC3 cell line in the MTT experiment. It had no effect on the PANC-1 cell line. In addition, apoptosis assays using Annexin V/PI demonstrated that NLPs-ATO-Erlo-RGD generated the highest apoptotic rates in PC3 cells when compared with NLPs-ATO-Erlo and the combination of free ATO and Erlo. Furthermore, treatment with NLPs-ATO-Erlo-RGD in (p < 0.05) PC3 cell line significantly reduced EGFR level. It is concluded NLPs-ATO-Erlo-RGD as a novel drug delivery system may be a promising platform for the treatment of cancer.""","""['Fatemeh Khosravani', 'Hamed Mir', 'Ali Mirzaei', 'Farzad Kobarfard', 'Hassan Bardania', 'Ebrahim Hosseini']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biotechnol Appl Biochem""","""['A novel RGDyC/PEG co-modified PAMAM dendrimer-loaded arsenic trioxide of glioma targeting delivery system.', 'Targeting of EGFR increase\xa0anti-cancer effects of arsenic trioxide: Promising treatment for glioblastoma multiform.', 'RGD conjugated liposome-hollow silica hybrid nanovehicles for targeted and controlled delivery of arsenic trioxide against hepatic carcinoma.', 'Arsenic trioxide preferentially induces nonapoptotic cell deaths as well as actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in the CHO AA8 cell line.', 'Molecular targets of arsenic trioxide in malignant cells.', 'Recent advance in phytonanomedicine and mineral nanomedicine delivery system of the treatment for acute myeloid leukemia.']"""

Because there is no overall survival benefit of one option over another, appropriate treatment must consider patient life expectancy, quality of life, and cost.  Methods:   The authors compared quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost effectiveness among treatment options for HRPC using a Markov model with three treatment arms: (1) external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) delivered with 20 fractions, (2) EBRT with 23 fractions followed by low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy boost, or (3) radical prostatectomy alone. An exploratory analysis considered a simultaneous integrated boost according to the FLAME trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01168479).  Results:   Treatment strategies were compared using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). EBRT with LDR brachytherapy boost was a cost-effective strategy (ICER, $20,929 per QALY gained). These results were most sensitive to variations in the biochemical failure rate. However, the results still demonstrated cost effectiveness for the brachytherapy boost paradigm, regardless of any tested parameter ranges. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that EBRT with LDR brachytherapy was favored in 52% of 100,000 Monte Carlo iterations. In an exploratory analysis, EBRT with a simultaneous integrated boost was also a cost-effective strategy, resulting in an ICER of $62,607 per QALY gained; however, it was not cost effective compared with EBRT plus LDR brachytherapy boost.  Conclusions:   EBRT with LDR brachytherapy boost may be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared with EBRT alone and radical prostatectomy for HRPC, demonstrating high-value care. The current analysis suggests that a reduction in biochemical failure alone can result in cost-effective care, despite no change in overall survival.""","""['Roman O Kowalchuk', 'Hayeon Kim', 'William S Harmsen', 'Elizabeth B Jeans', 'Lindsay K Morris', 'Trey C Mullikin', 'Robert C Miller', 'William W Wong', 'Carlos E Vargas', 'Daniel M Trifiletti', 'Ryan M Phillips', 'C R Choo', 'Brian J Davis', 'Sushil Beriwal', 'Rahul D Tendulkar', 'Bradley J Stish', 'William G Breen', 'Mark R Waddle']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Five-year outcomes from a prospective comparative effectiveness study evaluating external-beam radiotherapy with or without low-dose-rate brachytherapy boost for localized prostate cancer.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of primary treatments for localised prostate cancer: A population-based Markov analysis using real-world evidence.', 'Brachytherapy Boost Utilization and Survival in Unfavorable-risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Low-dose rate brachytherapy for men with localized prostate cancer.', 'A Brief Review of Low-Dose Rate (LDR) and High-Dose Rate (HDR) Brachytherapy Boost for High-Risk Prostate.']"""

Materials and methods:   Male participants with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer were prospectively enrolled and underwent prostate magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T. Axial and sagittal images of the T2 conv sequence and the T2 CS sequence were acquired. Sequences were qualitatively assessed by 2 blinded radiologists concerning artifacts, image-sharpness, lesion conspicuity, capsule delineation, and overall image quality using 5-point Likert items ranging from 1 (nondiagnostic) to 5 (excellent). The apparent signal-to-noise ratio and apparent contrast-to-noise ratio were evaluated. PI-RADS scores were assessed for both sequences. Statistical analysis was performed by using Wilcoxon signed rank test and paired samples t test. Intrarater and interrater reliability of qualitative image evaluation was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) estimates.  Results:   A total of 29 male participants were included (mean age, 66 ± 8 years). The acquisition time of the T2 CS sequence was respectively 26% (axial plane) and 24% (sagittal plane) shorter compared with the T2 conv sequence (eg, axial: 171 vs 232 seconds; P < 0.001). In the axial plane, the T2 CS sequence had fewer artifacts (4 [4-4.5] vs 4 [3-4]; P < 0.001), better image-sharpness (4 [4-4.5] vs 3 [3-3.5]; P < 0.001), better capsule delineation (4 [3-4] vs 3 [3-3.5]; P < 0.001), and better overall image quality (4 [4-4] vs 4 [3-4]; P < 0.001) compared with the T2 conv sequence. The ratings of lesion conspicuity were similar (4 [4-4] vs 4 [3-4]; P = 0.166). In the sagittal plane, the T2 CS sequence outperformed the T2 conv sequence in the categories artifacts (4 [4-4] vs 3 [3-4]; P < 0.001), image sharpness (4 [4-5] vs 4 [3-4]; P < 0.001), lesion conspicuity (4 [4-4] vs 4 [3-4]; P = 0.002), and overall image quality (4 [4-4] vs 4 [3-4]; P = 0.002).

Needle insertion in soft tissues may cause tissue motion and deformation, which can, in turn, result in tissue damage and needle positioning errors. In this study, we present a prototype system making use of a wasp-inspired (bioinspired) self-propelled needle, which is able to move forward with zero external push force, thereby avoiding large tissue motion and deformation. Additionally, the actuation system solely consists of 3D printed parts and is therefore safe to use inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. The needle consists of six parallel 0.25-mm diameter Nitinol rods driven by the actuation system. In the prototype, the self-propelled motion is achieved by advancing one needle segment while retracting the others. The advancing needle segment has to overcome a cutting and friction force while the retracting needle segments experience a friction force in the opposite direction. The needle self-propels through the tissue when the friction force of the five retracting needle segments overcomes the sum of the friction and cutting forces of the advancing needle segment. We tested the performance of the prototype in ex vivo human prostate tissue inside a preclinical MRI system in terms of the slip ratio of the needle with respect to the prostate tissue. The results showed that the needle was visible in MR images and that the needle was able to self-propel through the tissue with a slip ratio in the range of 0.78-0.95.

The percentage of patients with moderate/severe LUTS (IPSS &gt; 7) decreased from 60.2% (n = 213/354) at baseline to 52.8% (n = 187/354) at Week 48. Among patients with moderate/severe LUTS at baseline: 73.7% (n = 157/213) still had moderate/severe LUTS at Week 48; percentage reductions of patients with LUTS at Week 48 were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) overall and by age or concomitant treatment, except for alpha-blockers (84.2% patients receiving them still had moderate/severe LUTS at Week 48). All IPSS items, including quality of life for urinary symptoms, improved throughout the study. The only predictor of response to treatment with LHRH analogs that improved IPSS by 3 points after 48 weeks was baseline testosterone levels. Lower baseline testosterone levels were associated with greater improvement in IPSS after treatment with LHRH analogs (odds ratio 0.998, 95% confidence interval 0.996-1.000, p = 0.0277).  Conclusion:   LHRH analogs have a positive effect in patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer presenting moderate/severe LUTS regardless of age or concomitant treatment received (radiotherapy, antiandrogens, or alpha-blockers).""","""['Juan Morote', 'Antonio Gómez-Caamaño', 'Raúl Poza de Celis', 'Francisco Gómez-Veiga', 'Juan P Ciria', 'Jesús Calleja', 'Javier Extramiana', 'Maria Pérez-Sampietro', 'Valerie Perrot', 'Javier C Angulo;ANALUTS Study Group']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Neurourol Urodyn""","""['Triptorelin relieves lower urinary tract symptoms in Chinese advanced prostate cancer patients: a multicenter, non-interventional, prospective study.', 'Impact of Androgen Deprivation Therapy on Volume Reduction and Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy for volume reduction, lower urinary tract symptom relief and quality of life improvement in patients with prostate cancer: degarelix vs goserelin plus bicalutamide.', 'Degarelix versus goserelin plus bicalutamide therapy for lower urinary tract symptom relief, prostate volume reduction and quality of life improvement in men with prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Is the flare phenomenon clinically significant?']"""

Population-based register study in Sweden""","""Objective:   To investigate the association between surgeon volume and urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy.  Methods:   A total of 8326 men in The National Prostate Cancer Register of Sweden (NPCR) underwent robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) between 2017 and 2019 of whom 56% (4668/8 326) had responded to a questionnaire one year after RARP. The questionnaire included the question: 'How much urine leakage do you experience?' with the response alternatives 'Not at all', 'A little', defined as continence and 'Moderately', 'Much/Very much' as incontinence. Association between incontinence and mean number of RARPs/year/surgeon was analysed with multivariable logistic regression including age, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), PSA, prostate volume, number of biopsy cores with cancer, cT stage, Gleason score, lymph node dissection, nerve sparing intent and response rate to the questionnaire.  Results:   14% (659/4 668) of the men were incontinent one year after RARP. There was no statistically significant association between surgeon volume and incontinence. Older age (>75 years vs. < 65 years, OR 2.29 [95% CI 1.48-3.53]), higher CCI (CCI 2+ vs. CCI 0, OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.04-1.80]) and no nerve sparing intent (no vs. yes OR 1.53 [95% CI 1.26-1.85]) increased risk of incontinence. There were large differences in the proportion of incontinent men between surgeons with similar annual volumes, which remained after adjustment.

Method:   Source positioning errors (catheter shifts in 1 mm increments in the cranial/caudal, anterior/posterior, and medial/lateral directions up to ±6 mm) and catheter swap errors (between the most and least heavily weighted) were introduced retrospectively into DICOM treatment plans of 20 patients that previously received TRUS HDRPBT. Dose volume histogram (DVH) indices were monitored as errors were introduced sequentially into individual catheters, simulating potential errors throughout treatment. Whenever DVH indices were outside institution thresholds: prostate V100% <95%, urethra D0.1cc >118% and rectum Dmax >80%, the plan was adapted using remaining catheters (i.e., simulating previous catheters as previously delivered). The final DVH indices were recorded.  Results:   Prostate coverage (V100% >95%) could be maintained for source position errors up to 6 mm through online plan adaptation. The source position error at which the urethra D0.1cc and rectum Dmax was able to return to clinically acceptable levels using online adaptation varied between 6 mm to 1 mm, depending on the direction of the source position error and patient anatomy. After introduction of catheter swap errors to patient plans, prostate V100% was recoverable using online adaptation to near original plan characteristics. Urethra D0.1cc and rectum Dmax showed less recoverability.  Conclusion:   Online adaptive HDRPBT maintains the prostate V100% to clinically acceptable values for majority of directional shifts.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the urinary microbiome of genitourinary malignancies.  Materials and methods:   Metagenomic analysis of urinary DNA was performed in 85 patients including 30 with bladder cancer (BC), 27 with prostate cancer (PC), 12 with renal cancer (RC), and 16 with non-cancer (NC). 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted after amplification of the V3-V4 region.  Results:   PC and RC had significantly lower Shannon index than BC, and beta diversity showed significantly different microbiome composition between four groups. We identified six genera of Cutibacterium, Peptoniphilus, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Moraxella, which showed significantly different abundance between the four groups. When each of the malignancies were compared to NC at the species level, Micrococcus sp. was significantly increased in BC. We also identified 12 and five species with increased populations in PC and RC, respectively. Of these, Cutibacterium acnes, Cutibacterium granulosum, Peptoniphilus lacydonensis, and Tessaracoccus were significantly increased in both PC and RC.  Conclusions:   Urinary microbiome composition was different depending on the type of genitourinary malignancies, and we identified bacteria that are significantly associated with each type of malignancy.

Abiraterone acetate (AA), enzalutamide, and chemotherapy are first-line treatments for patients with mCRPC. This study examined prognostic factors for AA response in the form of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics throughout androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) in chemonaïve patients with mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively included data from 34 chemonaïve patients with mCRPC who had received AA at some point between January 2017 and December 2018. We separated patients into two study arms according to the decrease in PSA percentages after use of AA for 3 months. We correlated PSA kinetics parameters with response and compared the two study groups with respect to PSA kinetics.  Results:   The patients' median age was 77 years. In the total group of patients, 64% had a response to AA, whereas 35% did not. The ratio of the PSA level at nadir to the level during ADT was significantly higher in the AA-sensitive group (19.78 vs. 1.03, p=0.019).

Previous explorations of AKR1C3 are mainly based on tissue samples. This study investigates using plasma-based liquid biopsy to validate the prognostic and predictive value of AKR1C3 in patients with mCRPC .  Materials and methods:   We prospectively recruited 62 patients with mCRPC. All patients received repeated prostate biopsies at the time of mCRPC diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was used to detect protein expression of AKR1C3 in the tissues. We took their blood simultaneously and performed digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) to measure expression levels of AKR1C3 in the exosomes. The detected plasma and tissue AKR1C3 expression levels were analyzed for patients' overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival under first-line abiraterone use (ABI-PFS).  Results:   All other baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 groups. 15/62 (24.2%) and 25/62 (40.3%) patients showed AKR1C3-EXO positive (≥20 copies/20 μL) and AKR1C3-IHC positive, respectively.

Methods:   We used data from the EPICAP study, a French population-based case-control study including 819 incident prostate cancer cases and 879 controls frequency matched by age. Detailed information on sleep duration on work/free days, and sleep medication over lifetime was collected.  Results:   Sleep duration and sleep deprivation were not associated with prostate cancer, whatever the aggressiveness of prostate cancer. However, sleep deprivation was associated with an increased prostate cancer risk among men with an evening chronotype [OR, 1.96; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-3.70]. We also observed an increased risk of prostate cancer with higher duration of sleep medication use (Ptrend = 0.008). This association with long duration of sleep medication use (≥10 years) was more pronounced among men who worked at night 15 years or more (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.30-11.4) and among nonusers of NSAID (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.15-3.75).

Methods:   This retrospective, observational study pooled data from two completed prospective, multicenter cohort studies (X-TREME; Study 240) in adult patients with bone metastases from primary breast, prostate, lung, kidney, or other solid cancer types and administered denosumab 120 mg in routine clinical practice in Germany and Central and Eastern Europe. The studies were conducted between May 2012 and May 2017; pooled analysis was completed in August 2021. Medication adherence was described according to a three-component consensus taxonomy: initiation (first-ever administration ≤ 90 days from bone metastasis diagnosis), implementation (actual vs prescribed dosing; optimal implementation = regular/consistent dosing), and persistence (≤ 60-day gap between administrations at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Descriptive analyses were conducted for each cancer type.  Results:   The analysis included 1748 patients with solid tumors and bone metastases. Adherence with denosumab was generally high across the initiation, implementation, and persistence phases. Most patients experienced timely initiation (from 64.4% [kidney cancer] to 81.2% [breast cancer]) and optimal implementation (from 62.4% [lung cancer] to 72.5% [breast cancer]). The proportion of patients who were persistent with treatment at 6 months ranged from 41.4% (lung cancer) to 77.8% (prostate cancer).

Importantly, ectopic JAK-STAT activation is specifically required for the resistance of stem-like subclones expressing multilineage transcriptional programs but not subclones exclusively expressing the neuroendocrine-like lineage program.

Here, we present an exploratory analysis of pain and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).  Methods:   This double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial was conducted across 41 urological oncology sites in 11 countries in Europe and North America. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and had previously received docetaxel and up to one additional line of previous chemotherapy. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was defined as increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration or other signs of disease progression despite androgen-deprivation therapy and serum testosterone concentrations at castrate levels (≤50 ng/dL), and with at least one metastatic lesion on bone scan, CT, or MRI. Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral olaparib (300 mg twice per day) plus oral abiraterone (1000 mg once a day) and oral prednisone or prednisolone (5 mg twice a day) or placebo plus abiraterone (1000 mg once a day) and prednisone or prednisolone (5 mg twice a day). Randomisation was done without stratification and by use of an interactive voice or web response system. A randomised treatment kit ID number was assigned sequentially to each patient as they became eligible. The primary endpoint (radiographic progression-free survival) has previously been reported. HRQOL was a prespecified exploratory patient-reported outcome. Patients were asked to complete the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), single-item worst bone pain, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) questionnaire, and EuroQol-5 five-dimension five level (EQ-5D-5L) assessment at baseline, at weeks 4, 8, and 12, then every 12 weeks until treatment discontinuation. Prespecified outcomes were change from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain, single-item worst bone pain and FACT-P Total Outcome Index (TOI) scale scores, time to deterioration in BPI-SF worst pain and worst bone pain, and assessment of the EQ-5D-5L pain and discomfort domain. All analyses were exploratory and done in the full analysis set (all randomly assigned patients, including patients who were randomly assigned but did not subsequently go on to receive study treatment), with the exception of mean baseline and total change from baseline analyses, for which we used the population who had a valid baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01972217, and is no longer recruiting patients.  Findings:   Between Nov 25, 2014, and July 14, 2015, 171 patients were assessed for eligibility. 29 patients were excluded, and 142 were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive olaparib and abiraterone (n=71) or placebo and abiraterone (n=71). Data cutoff was Sept 22, 2017. Median follow-up was 15·9 months (IQR 8·1-25·5) in the olaparib plus abiraterone group and 24·5 months (8·1-27·6) in the placebo plus abiraterone group. Questionnaire compliance was generally high (43-100%). Least-squares mean changes from baseline in BPI-SF worst pain, single-item worst bone pain, and FACT-P TOI remained stable across all visits for patients in both treatment groups. Adjusted mean change in FACT-P TOI from baseline across all visits was -0·10 (95% CI -2·50 to 2·71) in the olaparib plus abiraterone group and -1·20 (-4·15 to 1·74) in the placebo plus abiraterone group (difference 1·30, 95% CI -2·70 to 5·30; p=0·52). Time to deterioration in pain was similar in both groups (BPI-SF worst pain HR 0·90 [95% CI 0·62-1·32], p=0·30; worst bone pain HR 0·85 [0·59-1·22], p=0·18). Improvement rates in the pain and discomfort domain of the EQ-5D-5L were similar in both groups from baseline to week 48, beyond which a higher proportion of patients in the olaparib plus abiraterone arm reported an improvement compared to the placebo plus abiraterone group.  Interpretation:   In these prespecified exploratory analyses, there was no significant difference in pain or HRQOL when olaparib was added to abiraterone. In this phase 2 trial, a statistically significant radiographic progression-free survival benefit was observed with the olaparib plus abiraterone combination. These results suggest that the improved survival benefits observed when combining olaparib with abiraterone does not result in different HRQOL compared with placebo plus abiraterone.

We report our single-institution initial experience with holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for LUTS in men with low-risk PCa being managed with AS.  Materials and methods:   Men on AS who underwent HoLEP between 2013 and 2019 were identified. Data regarding preoperative cancer workup, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), perioperative outcomes, and voiding parameters were analyzed. Postoperative surveillance for PCa including PSA nadir, prostate magnetic resonance imaging, prostate biopsy (PBx), and PSA at last follow-up were evaluated.  Results:   Twenty men met the inclusion criteria. Preoperative mean max flow 7.9 ml/s, median postvoid residual 101 cc, and mean transrectal ultrasound prostate size 99 cc. Patients had a median adjusted preoperative PSA of 8.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.8-13.2) ng/ml. Mean resected tissue weight was 65.5 g with improved postoperative flow rate and significantly decreased residual. A total of 5/20 men had PCa in the specimen (all Gleason Grade Group 1). The median postoperative PSA nadir was 1.2 (IQR: 0.5-1.8) ng/ml at median of 5 months. At the last follow-up (median 18.5 months, IQR: 10.5-37.8), the median postoperative PSA was 1.4 (IQR: 0.63-2.48) ng/ml. Nine men underwent postoperative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) with the identification of a new prostate imaging reporting and data system 5 lesion in one patient who underwent negative fusion biopsy. Five men underwent post-HoLEP PBx with progression in two patients, who both successfully underwent radical prostatectomy.  Conclusions:   Men on AS for low-risk PCa can safely undergo HoLEP with significantly improved voiding parameters. Postoperative monitoring with PSA, mpMRI, and PBx can detect disease progression requiring definitive treatment.

Individuals diagnosed with aggressive cancers are often at a greater risk of experiencing FT. The objectives of this study were to estimate FT among prostate cancer (PCa) survivors after 10-15 years of diagnosis, assess the relationship between PCa aggressiveness at diagnosis and FT, and examine whether current cancer treatment status mediates the relationship between PCa aggressiveness and FT.  Methods:   PCa patients enrolled in the North Carolina-Louisiana Prostate Cancer Project (PCaP) were recontacted for long-term follow-up. The prevalence of FT in the PCaP cohort was estimated. FT was estimated using the COmprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity, a validated measure of FT. The direct effect of PCa aggressiveness and an indirect effect through current cancer treatment on FT was examined using causal mediation analysis.  Results:   More than one-third of PCa patients reported experiencing FT. PCa aggressiveness was significantly independently associated with high FT; high aggressive PCa at diagnosis had more than twice the risk of experiencing FT than those with low or intermediate aggressive PCa (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.14-3.96). The proportion of the effect of PCa aggressiveness on FT, mediated by treatment status, was 10%, however, the adjusted odds ratio did not indicate significant evidence of mediation by treatment status (aOR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.95-1.20).

In this study, we assess the success of a using a publicly available KBP model compared with developing an in-house model for prostate cancer radiotherapy using a single, commercially available treatment planning system based on the ability of the model to achieve the centre's planning goals. Two radiation oncology centres each created a prostate cancer KBP model using the Eclipse RapidPlan software. These two models and a third publicly-available, shared model were tested at three centres in a retrospective planning study. The publicly-available model achieved lower rectum doses than the other two models. However, the planning-target-volume (PTV) doses did not meet the local planning goals and the model could not be adjusted to correct this. As a result, the plans most likely to satisfy local planning goals and requirements were created using an in-house model. For centres without an existing in-house model, a model created by another centre with similar planning goals was found to be preferred. Variations in local planning practices including contouring, treatment technique and planning goals can influence the relative performance of KBP. The value of publicly available KBP models could be enhanced through standardisation of planning goals and contouring guidelines, providing information related to the planning goals used to create the model and increased flexibility to allow local adaptation of the KBP model.""","""['E Claridge Mackonis', 'J Sykes', 'N Hardcastle', 'A Espinoza', 'A Brown', 'G Perez', 'B Evans', 'H Sheehan', 'A Haworth']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Eng Sci Med""","""['Dosimetric and planning efficiency comparison for lung SBRT: CyberKnife vs VMAT vs knowledge-based VMAT.', 'Clinical validation and benchmarking of knowledge-based IMRT and VMAT treatment planning in pelvic anatomy.', 'Can the Student Outperform the Master?

As a result, the appropriate treatment of wastewater that contains anticancer agents is crucial for pollution prevention. The purpose of this work is to assess the effectiveness of a Fe3O4@ZIF-8 nanocomposite as an adsorbent to remove of the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin (DOX) from aqueous solution. SEM, XRD, BET, FT-IR, Zeta potential, and point of zero charge analysis were used to study the surface and structural characteristics of the Fe3O4@ZIF-8 nanocomposite. Via the proposed treatment, 804.84 mg/g elimination was successful under the following circumstances: pH = 6; Fe3O4@ZIF-8 dose = 0.02 g/25 mL; DOX concentration = 1.22x10-3 mol; adsorption time = 100 min; and shaking speed = 200 rpm. A investigation of isotherms shown that the Langmuir equation and experimental data suited each other quite well. The adsorption of DOX on Fe3O4@ZIF-8 was endothermic and spontaneous, in accordance with thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, the elimination of DOX was enhanced by the rise in solution temperature. The kinetic analysis revealed that the pseudo-second order was fitted by the model. The suggested adsorption method could recycle Fe3O4@ZIF-8 nanocomposite six times, with a modest reduction in its ability for adsorption. For all XRD reflection peaks, physical characteristics including strain rates were computed and the dislocation of was 4.7 × 10-6.

In addition, differences in HRQoL following adjustments of the brachytherapy technique in 2001 were investigated by comparing Cohort A with men treated at the same clinic from 1998-2000, Cohort B.  Methods and material:   Cohort A: 1495 men treated with EBRT 2 Gy to 50 Gy and 2 fractions of 10 Gy HDRBT at a single centre, 2002-2008, still alive at five years. As part of routine follow-up, the patients responded to the EORTC QLQ-C30 and PR-25 questionnaires. Cohort B: HRQoL data was retrieved from an earlier study from the original article.  Results:   In Cohort A, 1046 (70%) men completed the questionnaires at five years, median age 66 years. In general, HRQoL mean scores were high and similar to Swedish age-matched normative data. Concerning disease-specific HRQoL, low levels of bowel and urinary problems were reported, in contrast to a substantial effect on sexual functioning. 'No' or 'A little' problems with faecal incontinence and urinary incontinence were reported by 98% and 93% of patients, respectively. The corresponding figure for sexual functioning was 39%. A difference in the frequency of nocturia in favour of Cohort A was the only statistically significant difference between Cohort A and B found in general and disease-specific HRQOL (p = 0.03), despite modifications in the brachytherapy procedure introduced in 2001.

Methods:   The Medline database and websites of 18 national screening organisations and professional associations were searched between January 2010 and November 2020 to identify screening guidelines published in English, considering recent clinical trials.  Results:   Population-based PSA testing of asymptomatic men is not widely recommended. Guidelines emphasize shared patient-clinician decision making. For 'average-risk' men choosing to be screened, the recommended age varies from 50-55 to 70 years, alongside consideration of life expectancy (ranging from 7-15 years). Screening intervals, when specified, are biennial (most common), annual, or determined from baseline PSA. The earliest age for screening high-risk men (frequently defined as of African descent or with a family history of prostate cancer) is 40 years, but recommendations often defer to clinical judgement.  Conclusions:   Population screening of asymptomatic men is not widely recommended. Instead, balancing the potential harms and benefits of PSA testing is endorsed.

On the one hand, the tumor-suppressing functions of NBPF1 have been definitively observed in neuroblastoma, prostate cancer, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and cervical cancer. On the other hand, there is evidence that NBPF1 regulates the colony formation, invasion, and maintenance of liver cancer cells and hence functions as an oncogene. The roles of NBPF1 are strictly dependent on the biological context and type of organization. However, a systematic pan-cancer analysis has thus far not been undertaken, and the significance of NBPF1 in the occurrence and progression of many malignancies is uncertain. In this paper, bioinformatics techniques were employed to analyze NBPF1 expression across different cancers and investigate the relationship between NBPF1 and clinical features, prognosis, genetic alteration, and tumor immune microenvironment, respectively. Our results show that NBPF1 is variably expressed in distinct tumor tissues and is also closely linked to clinical outcomes. In particular, compared to other tumor types, there was a strong negative correlation between NBPF1 expression and various components of the tumor microenvironment in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC). We thus developed an NBPF1-derived immune risk model based on NBPF1-related immune genes; ACC patients with a high-risk score tended to have a poorer prognosis, accompanied by immune hyporesponsiveness. NBPF1 can be used as a prognostic biomarker for multiple cancers. Moreover, anti-NBPF1 immunotherapy may be suitable for treating ACC patients.""","""['Lei Li', 'Sen Chen', 'Yueming Tang', 'Jie Wu', 'Yangzhige He', 'Ling Qiu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['NBPF1, a tumor suppressor candidate in neuroblastoma, exerts growth inhibitory effects by inducing a G1 cell cycle arrest.', 'Effects of neuroblastoma breakpoint family member 1 (NBPF1) gene on growth and Akt-p53-Cyclin D pathway in cutaneous squamous carcinoma cells.', 'NBPF1 independently determine the risk stratification and prognosis of patients with neuroblastoma.', ""Adrenocortical carcinoma: a clinician's update."", 'Objective assessment of adrenocortical carcinoma driver genes and their correlation with tumor pyruvate kinase M2.']"""

These chromosome conformations can be detected both in tumour and in circulating cells and have significant disease biomarker potential. We have recently detected specific chromosome conformations in circulating cells of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) which were similar to ones found in their primary tumours, however, the possibility of horizontal transfer of chromosome conformations was not studied previously.  Methods:   Human monocytes (U937) were co-cultured in Boyden chambers through 0.4 uM membrane with or without PC-3 human PCa cells or their conditioned media and a custom DNA microarray for 900,000 chromosomal loops covering all coding loci and non-coding RNA genes was performed on each part of the co-culture system.  Results:   We have detected 684 PC-3 cell-specific chromosome conformations across the whole genome that were absent in naïve monocytes but appeared in monocytes co-cultured with PC-3 cells or with PC-3-conditioned media. Comparing PC3-specific conformations to the ones we have previously detected in systemic circulation of high-risk PCa patients revealed 9 positive loops present in both settings.  Conclusions:   Our results demonstrate for the first time a proof of concept for horizontal transfer of chromosome conformations without direct cell-cell contact. This carries high clinical relevance as we have previously observed chromatin conformations in circulating cells of patients with melanoma and PCa similar to ones in their primary tumours. These changes can be used as highly specific biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis.

Here, we propose the application of cryoprotective agents (CPA) to the regions of the nerves in the NVB, prior to prostate cryosurgery, to minimize non-recoverable loss of AP conduction. We modeled a cryosurgical procedure based on data taken during a clinical case and applied ex-vivo porcine phrenic nerves and rat sciatic nerve with temperature profile of NVB. The APs were measured before and after the CPA exposures and during 3 h of recovery. Comparisons of AP amplitude recovery with various CPA compositions reveal that certain CPAs (e.g., 5% DMSO + 7.5% Trehalose and 5% M22 for porcine and rat nerves, respectively) showed little or no toxicity and effective cryoprotection from freezing (on average 48% and 30% of recovered AP, respectively).

Results:   In lPCa group, a total of 45 tumor lesions from 24 lPCa cases were included, 54.2% of lPCa patients were ISUP ≥ 2, 12.5% had tumor volume ≥ 0.5 ml, and 16.7% had extraprostatic extension (EPE). In cPCa group, there were a total of 429 tumor lesions in 126 cases, 92.1% of cPCa patients were ISUP ≥ 2, and 82.5% had tumor volume of ≥ 0.5 ml. 36.3% had EPE. LPCa and cPCa have the same spatial distribution characteristics, and no significant difference was detected between the anterior and posterior zone. Peripheral zone tumors were significantly more common than transitional zone tumors. Tumors in apical 1/3 and middle 1/3 were significantly more common than basal 1/3.  Conclusion:   The malignancy of cPCa is significantly higher than that of lPCa, and the spatial distribution of cPCa and lPCa is consistent.

Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate temporal trends and factors associated with the cancer diagnosed at stage IV in Brazil in two decades.  Methods:   Secondary-based study, with time series analysis for trend assessment and cross-sectional of factors associated with diagnosis of female breast, prostate, cervix uteri, colorectal, lung, stomach, lip and oral cavity, thyroid, esophagus or corpus uteri at stage IV.  Results:   1,218,322 cases were evaluated. The types of cancer with the highest proportion of stage IV at diagnosis in men and women, respectively, were: lung (53.7% and 57.4%), stomach (48.4% and 45.0%) and lip/oral cavity (53.5% and 43.4%). Most showed an increasing trend of annual percent change of cancer diagnosed at stage IV, being more pronounced in corpus uteri cancer (2013-2019: +7.4%, p < 0.001).

Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) of the LNCaP cell line (androgen-sensitive human prostate adenocarcinoma) with and without silenced KDM5D, MYBL2-binding sites were analyzed. Associations between MYBL2 mRNA expression and clinical outcomes were assessed in cohorts of men with localized and metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. In vitro assays with silencing and overexpression of MYBL2 and KDM5D in androgen receptor (AR)-positive hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP and LAPC4, were used to assess their influence on cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle distribution, as well as sensitivity to androgen deprivation, docetaxel, and cabazitaxel. We found that silencing KDM5D increased histone H3 lysine K4 (H3K4) trimethylation and increased MYBL2 expression. KDM5D and MYBL2 were negatively correlated with some but not all clinical samples. Higher MYBL2 expression was associated with a higher rate of relapse in localized disease and poorer overall survival in men with metastatic disease in the CHAARTED trial. Lower MYBL2 levels enhanced LNCaP and LAPC4 sensitivity to androgen deprivation and taxanes. In vitro, modifications of KDM5D and MYBL2 altered cell cycle distribution and apoptosis in a cell line-specific manner.

Methods:   Forty-six consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma between 2010 and 2015 treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and who had undergone computed tomography on rails imaging were included. Delivered doses to bladder and rectum were estimated using a contour-based deformable image registration method. The bladder and rectum NTCP were calculated using dose-response parameters applied to planned and delivered dose distributions. Seven urinary and gastrointestinal symptoms were prospectively collected using the validated prostate cancer symptom indices patient reported outcome (PRO) at pre-treatment, weekly treatment, and post-treatment follow-up visits. Correlations between planned and delivered doses against PRO were evaluated in this study.  Results:   Planned mean doses to bladder and rectum were 44.9 ± 13.6 Gy and 42.8 ± 7.3 Gy, while delivered doses were 46.1 ± 13.4 Gy and 41.3 ± 8.7 Gy, respectively. D10cc for rectum was 64.1 ± 7.6 Gy for planned and 60.1 ± 9.3 Gy for delivered doses.

Seven of 25 patients with follow-up data showed urinary complications (28%) and three had rectal complications (12%). Correlations of NTCP values of planned and delivered doses with PRO follow-up data were random for bladder and moderate for rectum (0.68 and 0.67, respectively).  Conclusion:   Sensitivity of bladder to clinical variations of dose accumulation indicates that an automated solution based on a DIR that considers inter-fractional organ deformation could recommend intervention.

Our results showed that GNA revealed not only antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities but also the induction of autophagy in PCa cells. In addition, autophagy inhibitor chloroquine enhanced the pro-apoptosis effect of GNA. Moreover, the activation of JNK pathway and the induction of apoptosis and autophagy triggered by GNA were attenuated by JNK inhibitor SP600125. We also found that GNA significantly promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Meanwhile, suppressing ER stress with 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) markedly blocked the activation of JNK pathway induced by GNA. Further research indicated that ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) effectively abrogated ER stress and JNK pathway activation induced by GNA. Furthermore, NAC and 4-PBA significantly reversed GNA-triggered apoptosis and autophagy. Finally, GNA remarkably suppressed prostate tumor growth with low toxicity in vivo.

These sequences are able to quantify morphology, micro-circulation, and cellular density patterns that might be related to cancer disease. Nonetheless, this evaluation is mainly carried out by expert radiologists, introducing inter-reader variability in the diagnosis. Therefore, different deep learning models were proposed to support the diagnosis, but a proper representation of prostate lesions remains limited due to the non-alignment among sequences and the dependency of considerable amounts of labeled data for learning. The main limitation of such representation lies in the cross-entropy minimization that only exploits inter-class variation, being insufficient data augmentation and transfer learning strategies. This work introduces a Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL) strategy that fully exploits the inter and intra-class variability of prostate lesions to robustly represent MRI regions. This strategy extracts lesion sample tuples, with positive and negative labels, regarding a query lesion. Such tuples are involved into an easy-positive, and semi-hard negative mining to project samples that better update the deep representation. The proposed learning strategy achieved an average ROC-AVC of 0.82, to characterize prostate cancer in MRI, using only the 60% of the available annotated data.

In particular, the significant differential expression of AGR2 further supports its clinical relevance in supplementing prostate-specific antigen screening for detecting prostate cancer. These findings have the potential to further advance our knowledge of genes governing the development of cancer in prostate epithelial cells. Clinical Relevance- Our results establish the importance of 6 prostate cancer markers (HPN, RAC3, CD24, HOXC6, AGR2, and IGFBP3) in distinguishing between prostate cancer epithelial cells and benign prostate hyperplasia epithelial cells.""","""['Kirill Borziak', 'Joseph Finkelstein']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Annu Int Conf IEEE Eng Med Biol Soc""","""['Surface CD24 distinguishes between low differentiated and transit-amplifying cells in the basal layer of human prostate.', 'The role of HOXC6 in prostate cancer development.', 'Gene expression profiles of lysophosphatidic acid-related molecules in the prostate: relevance to prostate cancer and benign hyperplasia.', 'The expanding role of epigenetics in the development, diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'The role of prostate-specific antigen in the evaluation of benign prostatic hyperplasia.']"""

Part 2: in-vivo tumor-targeting using a classification model combining spectral and MRI-radiomics features""","""Significance:   The diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer (PCa) are limited by a lack of intraoperative information to accurately target tumors with needles for biopsy and brachytherapy. An innovative image-guidance technique using optical devices could improve the diagnostic yield of biopsy and efficacy of radiotherapy.  Aim:   To evaluate the performance of multimodal PCa detection using biomolecular features from in-situ Raman spectroscopy (RS) combined with image-based (radiomics) features from multiparametric magnetic resonance images (mpMRI).  Approach:   In a prospective pilot clinical study, 18 patients were recruited and underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy. Multimodality image fusion (preoperative mpMRI with intraoperative transrectal ultrasound) combined with electromagnetic tracking was used to navigate an RS needle in the prostate prior to brachytherapy. This resulting dataset consisted of Raman spectra and co-located radiomics features from mpMRI. Feature selection was performed with the constraint that no more than 10 features were retained overall from a combination of inelastic scattering spectra and radiomics. These features were used to train support vector machine classifiers for PCa detection based on leave-one-patient-out cross-validation.  Results:   RS along with biopsy samples were acquired from 47 sites along the insertion trajectory of the fiber-optics needle: 26 were confirmed as benign or grade group = 1, and 21 as grade group &gt;1, according to histopathological reports. The combination of the fingerprint region of the RS and radiomics showed an accuracy of 83% (sensitivity = 81 % and a specificity = 85 % ), outperforming by more than 9% models trained with either spectroscopic or mpMRI data alone. An optimal number of features was identified between 6 and 8 features, which have good potential for discriminating grade group ≥1 / grade group &lt;1 (accuracy = 87 % ) or grade group &gt;1 / grade group ≤1 (accuracy = 91 % ).

Recent studies showed that LGBs have decreased healthcare utilization compared to heterosexual counterparts. Few studies have examined how sexual orientation impacts cancer screening and prevalence. We, therefore, investigated the association between sexual orientation and prevalent sex-specific cancer including prostate (PCa), breast (BC), and cervical (CC) cancer.  Methods:   This was a cross-sectional survey-based US study, including men and women aged 18 + from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) database between 2017 and 2019. The primary endpoint was individual-reported prostate, breast, and cervical cancer screening and prevalence rates among heterosexual and LGB men and women. Multivariable logistic regression analyses assessed association of various covariates with undergoing screening and diagnosis of these cancers.  Results:   Overall, 4,441 and 6,333 heterosexual men and women, respectively, were compared to 225 and 213 LGB men and women, respectively. LGBs were younger and less likely to be screened for PCa, BC, and CC than heterosexuals. A higher proportion of heterosexual women than lesbian and bisexual women were screened for CC with pap smears (95.36% vs. 90.48% and 86.11%, p ≤ 0.001) and BC with mammograms (80.74% vs. 63.81% and 45.37%, p ≤ 0.001). Similarly, a higher proportion of heterosexual men than gay and bisexual men were screened for PCa with PSA blood tests (41.27% vs. 30.53% and 27.58%, p ≤ 0.001).  Conclusion:   There were more heterosexuals than LGBs screened for CC, BC, and PCa. However, no association between sexual orientation and cancer diagnosis was found.

Interactions (n = 25) were selected if they included invitations to participate in a clinical trial. We used descriptive, qualitative discourse analysis, a method that identifies language patterns at or above the sentence level. We first excerpted discussions of clinical trials, then identified instances of plain language within those discussions. Finally, we inductively coded those instances to describe physicians' plain language practices.  Results:   The analysis identified four plain language practices. Lexical simplification replaced medical terminology with simpler words. Patient-centered definition named, categorized, and explained complex medical terminology. Metaphor explained medical terminology by comparing it with known concepts. Finally, experience-focused description replaced medical terminology with descriptions of patients' potential physical experiences.  Conclusion:   These plain language practices hold promise as part of effective information exchange in discussions of cancer clinical trials.

Although it has been reported that biomechanical forces, including wall shear stress (WSS), enhance the metastatic features of cancer cells, its mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigate how cancer cells sense mechanical stress and propagate signals in the TME.  Main methods:   Using a microfluidic device, interstitial fluid-mimicking flow (0.05 dyne cm-2) was applied to the human prostate cancer cell line PC3. Piezo1 siRNA and shRNA lentivirus were applied to PC3 cells to ablate Piezo1 expression. PC3-Luc2 cells expressing control shRNA or shPiezo1 lentivirus were administered into the prostate of BALB/c mice for orthotopic injection.  Key finding:   Here, we show that Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, is activated by WSS in microfluidic channels. Moreover, Yoda1, a Piezo1 agonist, synergistically potentiates cancer cell motility and nuclear retention of YAP/TAZ via WSS. Also, Piezo1 increases Src phosphorylation, which activates YAP. Conversely, silencing Piezo1 significantly reduces cell motility and YAP/TAZ activity induced by WSS, and finally retards tumor growth and metastasis of administered PC3 cells in BALB/c mice.  Significance:   Taken together, these results demonstrate that Piezo1 allows cancer cells to sense mechanical stimuli by altering the microenvironment during tumor progression and is a critical player in modulating cancer metastasis through the Piezo1-Src-YAP axis.""","""['Ok-Hyeon Kim', 'Young Wook Choi', 'Jun Hyung Park', 'Soon Auck Hong', 'Mineui Hong', 'In Ho Chang', 'Hyun Jung Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['Piezo1 mediates endothelial atherogenic inflammatory responses via regulation of YAP/TAZ activation.', 'Shear stress-induced nuclear shrinkage through activation of Piezo1 channels in epithelial cells.', 'PIEZO1 Ion Channels Mediate Mechanotransduction in Odontoblasts.', 'Channeling the Force: Piezo1 Mechanotransduction in Cancer Metastasis.', 'Mechanosensitive ion channels in apoptosis and ferroptosis: focusing on the role of Piezo1.', 'Travelling under pressure - hypoxia and shear stress in the metastatic journey.', 'Activation of Piezo1 promotes osteogenic differentiation of aortic valve interstitial cell through YAP-dependent glutaminolysis.', 'Role of extrinsic physical cues in cancer progression.']"""

Herein, new cyano pyridines that target PIM-1 kinase were designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated. Two prostate cell lines were used to examine each of the new compounds in vitro for anticancer activity, namely, PC-3 and DU-145. The cyanopyridine derivatives 2b, 3b, 4b, and 5b with an N,N-dimethyl phenyl group at the pyridine ring's 4-position showed considerable antitumor effect on the tested cell lines. Additionally, the high selectivity index revealed that these compounds were less cytotoxic to normal WI-38 cells. Furthermore, they exhibited strong inhibitory effect on PIM-1 having IC50 = 0.248, 0.13, 0.326 and 0.245 μM, respectively. The most powerful derivatives2b, 3b, 4b, and 5b, were chosen for further examination of their inhibitory potential on both kinases (PIM-2 and PIM-3). Interestingly, upon loading compound 3b in a cubosomes formulation with nanometric size, improvements in cytotoxicity and inhibitory effect on PIM-1 kinase were observed. In silico ADME parameters study revealed that compound 3b is orally bioavailable without penetration to the blood-brain barrier. Further, the docking simulations revealed the ability of our potent compounds to well accommodate the PIM-1 kinase active site forming stable complexes. In a 150 ns MD simulation, the most powerful PIM-1 inhibitor 3b produced stable complex with the PIM-1 enzyme (RMSD = 1.76).

Methods:   Associations of MVI use and prostate cancer risk were evaluated using data from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT). Cox proportional hazards models estimated associations of MVI use with risk of total, low-, and high-grade prostate cancer. Longitudinal data were used to evaluate screening and biopsy patterns. To account for differential biopsy patterns, the probability of prostate cancer was estimated for men with a positive screening value but no biopsy. Incidence density ratios were used to approximate HRs, and associations of MVI use with predicted prostate cancer risk were compared with observed.  Results:   Analyses of data from observed biopsies suggest a respective 19% (95% confidence interval, 10%-28%) and 21% (12%-31%) higher risk of high-grade prostate cancer for current and long-term MVI use, compared with no use. Current and long-term MVI use was associated with a shorter time to first on-study biopsy, indicating the potential for detection bias. After accounting for differential acceptance of biopsy, associations of MVI use with prostate cancer were attenuated and not statistically significant.  Conclusions:   In SELECT, biopsy acceptance patterns differed by MVI use. Estimates of associations of MVI use with prostate cancer risk based on observed biopsy data may be biased by differential acceptance of biopsy.  Impact:   Differential biopsy ascertainment may impact associations of risk factors and prostate cancer.

We evaluated the association between antidepressant use and prostate cancer recurrence, in survivors with comorbid depressive disorders.  Methods:   We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 10,017 men with prostate cancer (stages I-II) diagnosed who also had a comorbid depressive disorder followed a maximum of 22 years, and examined rates of biochemical recurrence by antidepressant medication use. We conducted multivariable Cox models based on time-dependent antidepressant drug use status, and examined the risk of biochemical recurrence by cumulative duration of antidepressant use.  Results:   Of these 10,017 survivors, 1842 (18%) experienced biochemical recurrence over 69,500 person-years of follow-up. The prostate cancer biochemical recurrence rate was greater with antidepressant non-use (31.3/1000 person-years) compared to antidepressant use (23.5/1000 person-years). In Cox proportional hazards multivariable adjusted models, non-use of antidepressants was associated with a 34% increased risk of biochemical recurrence compared to antidepressant use (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.24-1.44). Longer use of antidepressants was associated with a lower biochemical recurrence risk (P trend test < 0.001).

Because direct comparisons between these treatments are not available to guide treatment decisions, indirect comparisons can be of interest.  Methods:   Our analysis evaluated second-generation hormone treatments proposed for M0CRPC. We searched multiple databases for articles published between 2010 and 2022. Phase-III clinical trials that studied these agents in M0CRPC patients were eligible. Among these, we included trials reporting overall survival (OS) through Kaplan-Meier curves. We performed the reconstruction of individual patient data from Kaplan-Meier graphs, according to the Shiny method, to indirectly compare the efficacy of the different agents. Indirect comparisons included testing for equivalence according to FDA criteria. Confidence intervals (CI) were 95% in all analyses except equivalence testing, where 90%CIs were used.  Results:   Three studies met these inclusion criteria. Apalutamide (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.88), darolutamide (HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.58-0.84), and enzalutamide (HR 0.77, 95%CI 0.65-0.90) were all significantly more effective than the placebo. Our results showed no difference in OS between any of these three agents, and in testing for equivalence, our estimates of HR met the 0.75-1.33 level.

The majority of these cancers are diagnosed by core biopsy, posing a considerable strain on a service that struggles to recruit sufficient histopathologists. The current methodology for tissue diagnosis has a significant false-negative rate, small false-positive rate, and a proportion of indeterminate diagnoses. Therefore, this area presents an opportunity both to improve diagnostic quality and to reduce the burden on resources. We investigated streamlining tissue pathways by increasing the utilization of readily available resources to reduce the burden on scarce resources and improve the accuracy of diagnosis. This involved applying prospective multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) using 4 different markers (CK5, p63, racemase, and Ki-67) and 2 chromogens. We conducted a prospective study using over 8000 cores and 3 consultant histopathologists. The pathologists assessed each core using either conventional stains (hematoxylin and eosin) only or multiplex IHC only. The results of this assessment were later compared with the overall assessment made for the final histologic diagnosis. Results show that IHC alone has a positive predictive value of 98.97% and a negative predictive value of 99.91%, while hematoxylin and eosin alone has a positive predictive value of 94.21% and negative predictive value of 99.07%, demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy. When assessed against the use of on-demand IHC, prospective IHC improves turn-around-times, reduces indeterminate diagnoses, improves pathologist's accuracy and efficiency and, in overall terms, is cost-effective. In addition, it is possible to structure these tests within the routine of a diagnostic service with little impact on the overall capacity of the laboratory.""","""['Teresa Thomas', 'Sarah Wedden', 'Naveed Afzal', 'John Mikel', ""Corrado D'Arrigo""]""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol""","""['Virtual microscopy in prostate histopathology: simultaneous viewing of biopsies stained sequentially with hematoxylin and eosin, and alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase/p63 immunohistochemistry.', 'Prospective evaluation of AMACR (P504S) and basal cell markers in the assessment of routine prostate needle biopsy specimens.', 'How often does alpha-methylacyl-CoA-racemase contribute to resolving an atypical diagnosis on prostate needle biopsy beyond that provided by basal cell markers?', 'Optimization of initial prostate biopsy in clinical practice: sampling, labeling and specimen processing.', ""Immunohistochemical algorithms in prostate diagnostics: what's new?.""]"""

There is increasing evidence that PRMTs are deregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, the expression of two PRMT members, PRMT2 and PRMT7 as well as JMJD6, a demethylase, was analyzed in PCa. Initially, we retrieved data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to explore the differential expression of various PRMT family members in patients with PCa and then applied immunohistochemistry in a patient cohort across the spectrum of PCa, including non-neoplastic prostate tissue and lymph node metastatic foci. The results from the TCGA analysis revealed that PRMT7, PRMT6 and PRMT3 expression increased while PRMT2, PRMT9 and JMJD6 levels decreased in the tumor compared to non-neoplastic prostate. Results from the GEO datasets were similar, albeit not identical with the TCGA results, with PRMT7 and PRMT3 being upregulated and PRMT2 and JMJD6 being downregulated in the tumor compared to non-neoplastic tissue in some of them. In addition, PRMT7 levels decreased with stage and grade progression in the TCGA analysis. In the patient cohort, both PRMTs and JMJD6 were overexpressed in PCa compared to non-neoplastic tissue, and nuclear PRMT2 and JMJD6 were upregulated in lymph node metastasis, too. PRMT7 and JMJD6 expression were upregulated with the progression of stage and JMJD6 was also increased with the elevation of grade. After androgen ablation therapy, nuclear expression of PRMT7 and JMJD6 were elevated compared to untreated tumors. PRMT2, PRMT7 and JMD6 were also correlated with markers of EMT and cell cycle regulators. Finally, our findings indicate that PRMTs and JMJD6 are involved in prostate cancer progression and revealed a potential interplay of PRMTs with EMT mediators, underscoring the need for therapeutic targeting of arginine methylation in prostate cancer.""","""['Ioanna Maria Grypari', 'Ioanna Pappa', 'Thomas Papastergiou', 'Vasiliki Zolota', 'Vasiliki Bravou', 'Maria Melachrinou', 'Vasileios Megalooikonomou', 'Vasiliki Tzelepi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Histol Histopathol""","""['The protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) PRMT1 and CARM1 as candidate epigenetic drivers in prostate cancer progression.', 'The macromolecular complexes of histones affect protein arginine methyltransferase activities.', 'Profiling PRMT methylome reveals roles of hnRNPA1 arginine methylation in RNA splicing and cell growth.', 'Protein arginine methylation/demethylation and cancer.', 'The Novel Protease Activities of JMJD5-JMJD6-JMJD7 and Arginine Methylation Activities of Arginine Methyltransferases Are Likely Coupled.', 'JMJD6 functions as an oncogene and is associated with poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.']"""

Materials and methods:   A multicenter retrospective cohort study comprising patients who underwent MRI-guided prostate biopsy was conducted. To address possible benefits of TP-TBx in the detection of prostate cancer (PCa) and csPCa, a cohort of patients undergoing TP-TBx were compared to patients undergoing TR-TBx. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of PCa and csPCa detection.  Results:   Overall, 1,936 and 3,305 patients who underwent TR-TBx vs TP-TBx at 10 referral centers were enrolled. The rate of PCa and csPCa diagnosed was higher for TP-TBx vs TR-TBx (64.0% vs 50%, p <0.01 and 49% vs 35%, p <0.01).

Materials and methods:   HRPC patients treated on 3 trials of neoadjuvant NHA followed by RP formed the neo-RP cohort (112). The RP group (259) comprised an observational cohort of HRPC patients undergoing RP without neoadjuvant therapy between 2010-2016 at our institution who met key eligibility criteria for the neoadjuvant trials (ie ≥3 positive biopsy cores and Gleason ≥4+3=7). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to minimize potential confounding factors when estimating treatment effects. The primary outcomes were time to biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastasis-free survival (MFS).  Results:   Before IPTW, the neo-RP cohort had higher rates of Gleason 9-10 cancer (46% vs 24%), cT3 disease (22% vs 5%), and PSA ≥20 ng/ml (14% vs 7%); after IPTW, the 2 cohorts were balanced. Overall, after IPTW, time to BCR (HR=0.25 [95% CI 0.18-0.37]) and MFS (HR=0.26 [0.15-0.46]) were significantly longer in the neo-RP compared to the RP cohort. Rates of adjuvant (7% vs 24%) and salvage therapy (34% vs 46%) were lower in the neo-RP cohort.  Conclusions:   Neoadjuvant therapy with an NHA prior to RP was associated with longer time to BCR and superior MFS compared to up-front RP in men with HRPC.

Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2), a NAD+ -dependent protein deacetylase, is associated with age-related diseases. However, SIRT2 roles in PCa are unclear yet.  Methods:   Data of SIRT2 expression were extracted from TCGA cohort and GSE54460 cohort. Realtime quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were employed to analyze the expression of SIRT2 in PCa tissues. Cell counting Kit-8 assay, lentiviral transduction, flow cytometry, transwell experiments, western blot and metabolomic analysis were performed to explore the functions of SIRT2.  Results:   SIRT2 exhibited increased expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Overexpression of SIRT2 promoted cell proliferation, the proportion of S phase, migration and invasion, and reduced apoptosis rate. The increased phosphorylated ERK1/2 indicated the regulation of SIRT2 to cell proliferation, migration and invasion through activation of ERK1/2 pathway. Furthermore, SIRT2 affected cell metabolic profile and induces lactosylceramide production through upregulation of B4GALT5, which further contributes cell migration and invasion.  Conclusions:   Our data suggested that SIRT2 is overexpressed in CRPC and NEPC and could promote cell growth and migration through activating ERK1/2 pathway and inducing lactosylceramide production, indicating that SIRT2 has the potential to be a new target for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Rui Lin', 'Yiping Yang', 'Eran Wu', 'Menghan Zhou', 'Shan Wang', 'Qingyun Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['SIRT2 mediates multidrug resistance in acute myelogenous leukemia cells via ERK1/2 signaling pathway.', 'Sirtuin 2 in Endometrial Cancer: A Potential Regulator for Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis and RAS/ERK Pathway.', 'Sirtuin 2 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation and RAS/ERK signaling, and promotes cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in multiple myeloma.', 'SIRT2 Promotes the Migration and Invasion of Gastric Cancer through RAS/ERK/JNK/MMP-9 Pathway by Increasing PEPCK1-Related Metabolism.', 'SIRT2 plays complex roles in neuroinflammation neuroimmunology-associated disorders.']"""

The detection methods for PCa are either unreliable, like prostate-specific antigen (PSA), or extremely invasive, such as in the case of biopsies. Therefore, there is an urgent necessity for reliable and less invasive detection procedures that can differentiate between patients with benign diseases and those with cancer. In this matter, microRNAs (miRNAs) are suggested as potential biomarkers for cancer. MiRNAs have been found to be dysregulated in several different cancers, and these genetic alterations may present specific signatures for a given malignancy. Here, we examined the expression of miR141-3p, miR145-5p, miR146a-5p, and miR148b-3p in human tissue samples of PCa (n = 41) and benign prostatic diseases (BPD) (n = 30) using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).

Materials and methods:   105 prostate cancer patients confirmed by pathology after radical prostatectomy in our hospital from 2017 to 2021 were selected. The clinical stage, PSA, Gleason score, number of positive biopsy cores, and percentage of positive biopsy cores were recorded. Evaluate EPE grade according to EPE grade criteria, and calculate the probability of predicting EPE with Partin tables and MSKCCn. EPE grade is combined with Partin tables and MSKCCn to construct EPE grade+Partin tables and EPE grade+MSKCCn models. Calculate the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of EPE grade, Partin tables, MSKCCn, EPE grade+Partin tables, and EPE grade+MSKCCn and compare their diagnostic efficacy. The clinical decision curve was used to analyze the clinical net income of each prediction scheme.  Results:   The AUC of EPE grade was 0.79, Partin tables was 0.50, MSKCCn was 0.78, the EPE grade+Partin table model was 0.79, and the EPE grade+MSKCCn model was 0.83. After EPE grade was combined with Partin tables and MSKCCn, the diagnostic efficiency of clinical model was significantly improved (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the diagnostic efficacy of the combined model compared with the single EPE grade (P > 0.05). The calibration curve of the combined model shows that it has a good calibration degree for EPE.

Materials and methods:   Firstly, pronouncement of miR-205 in normal and prostate carcinoma tissues was analyzed by using UALCAN database. The relationship between miR-205 in tumor tissues and the pathological and clinical characteristics of patients with prostate carcinoma were analyzed. Consequently, 60 people with prostate carcinoma were collected to the Minhang Hospital from August 2016 to August 2021. Serum of patients in the two groups was collected, and RNA in serum exosomes was extracted, and qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of miR-205 mediated by serum exosomes. Meanwhile, the relationship among the clinical as well as pathological aspects and bodement of patients with prostate carcinoma and the pronouncement level of miR-205 mediated by exosome was compared. Next, assays like wound healing and CKK-8 were used to investigate the effects of miR-205 in exosomes extracted from prostate carcinoma on the augmentation and metastasis of prostate carcinoma.  Results:   The results showed that the pronouncement level of miR-205 in tissues with prostate carcinoma was significantly lower than that in normal prostate tissues. In addition, the pronouncement level of miR-205 in fluid exosome of people with prostate carcinoma and exosomes derived from the lines of prostate carcinoma was considerably less than that in serum exosomes of healthy patients and that of normal cell lines of prostate. The pronouncement level of miR-205 in fluid exosomes of people with prostate carcinoma was negatively associated with cancer phase, uncontrolled cell division in lymph nodes, distant metastasis, and PSA level at initial diagnosis. Analysis (multivariate and univariate) showed that miR-205 pronouncement was a sovereign threat cause for prognosis of prostate cancer patients. Additionally, the pronouncement and metastasis of prostate carcinoma can be restricted by the overexpression of miR-205.  Conclusion:   The pronouncement of miR-205 in liquid derived exosomes is correlated with the prediction of people with prostate carcinoma and may be a new marker for identification and cure of prostate carcinoma.""","""['Zhuifeng Guo', 'Xuwei Lu', 'Fan Yang', 'Liang Qin', 'Ning Yang', 'Peiran Cai', 'Conghui Han', 'Jiawen Wu', 'Hang Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Comput Math Methods Med""","""['Retracted: The Expression of miR-205 in Prostate Carcinoma and the Relationship with Prognosis in Patients.', 'Prostate carcinoma cell-derived exosomal MicroRNA-26a modulates the metastasis and tumor growth of prostate carcinoma.', 'Exosome circ_0044516 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and metastasis as a potential biomarker.', 'Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived microRNA-205-containing exosomes impede the progression of prostate cancer through suppression of RHPN2.', 'Semen miRNAs Contained in Exosomes as Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes attenuated prostate cancer progression via the miR-99b-5p/IGF1R axis.', 'Mechanism of Exosomal LncRNA PART1 in Esophageal Cancer Angiogenesis by Targeting miR-302a-3p/CDC25A Axis.', 'Dynamic Role of Exosome microRNAs in Cancer Cell Signaling and Their Emerging Role as Noninvasive Biomarkers.']"""

Earlier, we developed drug candidate galeterone, which advanced through phase 2-clinical trials in treating castration-resistant PCa (CRPC). Subsequently, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated next-generation galeterone-analogs including VNPP433-3β which is potently efficacious against pre-clinical models of PCa. This study describes the mechanism of action of VNPP433-3β that promotes degradation of full-length AR (fAR) and its splice variant AR-V7 besides depleting MNK1/2 in in vitro and in vivo CRPC models that stably overexpresses fAR. VNPP433-3β directly engages AR within the cell and promotes proteasomal degradation of fAR and its splice variant AR-V7 by enhancing the interaction of AR with E3 ligases MDM2/CHIP but disrupting AR-HSP90 binding. Next, VNPP433-3β decreases phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and abates binding of eIF4E and eIF4G to 5' cap of mRNA by depleting MNK1/2 with consequent depletion of phosphorylated eIF4E. Finally, RNA-seq demonstrates modulation of multiple pathways that synergistically contribute to PCa inhibition. Therefore, VNPP433-3β exerts its antitumor effect by imposing 1) transcriptional regulation of AR and AR-responsive oncogenes 2) translational regulation by disrupting mRNA-5'cap-dependent translation initiation, 3) reducing AR half-life through enhanced proteasomal degradation in vitro and AR-overexpressing tumor xenografts in vivo.""","""['Elizabeth Thomas', 'Retheesh S Thankan', 'Puranik Purushottamachar', 'Weiliang Huang', 'Maureen A Kane', 'Yuji Zhang', 'Nicholas P Ambulos', 'David J Weber', 'Vincent C O Njar']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Transcriptome profiling reveals that VNPP433-3β, the lead next-generation galeterone analog inhibits prostate cancer stem cells by downregulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stem cell markers.', 'Galeterone and The Next Generation Galeterone Analogs, VNPP414 and VNPP433-3β Exert Potent Therapeutic Effects in Castration-/Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Preclinical Models In Vitro and In Vivo.', 'The retinamide VNLG-152 inhibits f-AR/AR-V7 and MNK-eIF4E signaling pathways to suppress EMT and castration-resistant prostate cancer xenograft growth.', 'Androgen receptor targeting drugs in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance.', 'Androgen receptor splicing variant 7: Beyond being a constitutively active variant.', 'NOTCH pathway inactivation reprograms stem-like oral cancer cells to JAK-STAT dependent state and provides the opportunity of synthetic lethality.', 'Targeted Degradation of Androgen Receptor by VNPP433-3β in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells Implicates Interaction with E3 Ligase MDM2 Resulting in Ubiquitin-Proteasomal Degradation.', 'Murine toxicology and pharmacokinetics of lead next generation galeterone analog, VNPP433-3β.', 'The SMARCD Family of SWI/SNF Accessory Proteins Is Involved in the Transcriptional Regulation of Androgen Receptor-Driven Genes and Plays a Role in Various Essential Processes of Prostate Cancer.']"""

To facilitate research and deep analysis of these few cells, significant efforts were made to expand them. We evaluated here whether the isolation of fresh CTCs from patients with metastatic cancers could provide a reliable tumor model after a CAM xenograft. We enrolled 35 patients, with breast, prostate, or lung metastatic cancers. We performed microfluidic-based CTC enrichment. After 48-72 h of culture, the CTCs were engrafted onto the CAM of embryonated chicken eggs at day 9 of embryonic development (EDD9). The tumors were resected 9 days after engraftment and histopathological, immunochemical, and genomic analyses were performed. We obtained in ovo tumors for 61% of the patients. Dedifferentiated small tumors with spindle-shaped cells were observed. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of CTCs could explain this phenotype. Beyond the feasibility of NGS in this model, we have highlighted a genomic concordance between the in ovo tumor and the original patient's tumor for constitutional polymorphism and somatic alteration in one patient.

Exosomes derived from the human prostate cancer cell line PC3 were evaluated by NTA and AFM, and those results were compared with Monte Carlo simulations. The mean size, evaluated by AFM shortly after application on the mica substrate, is less than its real value. It obtains the correct value faster for a thinner sample drop. Fitting the log-normal distribution to the geometric and hydrodynamic diameters leads to the conclusion that the latter could arise from the former by linear scaling by a factor that could be used to characterize the analyzed extracellular vesicles.

Tumor suppressive miR-99b-5p has been implicated in regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in a variety of types of cancer. Our previous study suggested the reciprocal miR-99b-5p/MTOR (downregulated/upregulated) pairing as a key microRNA-mRNA regulatory component involved in the prostate cancer (PCa) disparities. In this study, we further validated the expression profiles of mTOR and miR-99b-5p in the PCa, colon, breast, and lung cancer specimens and cell lines. The immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence, Western blot, and RT-qPCR assays have confirmed that mTOR is upregulated while miR-99b-5p is downregulated in different patient cohorts and a panel of cancer cell lines. Intriguingly, elevated nuclear mTOR expression was observed in African American PCa and other advanced cancers. Transfection of the miR-99b-5p mimic resulted in a significant reduction in nuclear mTOR and androgen receptor (AR), while a slight/moderate to no decrease in cytoplasmic mTOR and AR in PCa and other cancer cells, suggesting that miR-99b-5p inhibits mTOR and AR expression and their nuclear translocation. Moreover, overexpression of miR-99b-5p targets/inhibits AR-mTOR axis, subsequently initiating cell apoptosis and sensitizing docetaxel-induced cytotoxicity in various cancers. In conclusion, our data suggest that reciprocal miR-99b-5p/nuclear mTOR pairing may be a more precise diagnostic/prognostic biomarker for aggressive PCa, than miR-99b-5p/MTOR pairing or mTOR alone.

Although the inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) have been utilized as potent anti-cancer agents, their efficacy in clinical trials varied among patient groups and has often been unpredictable. Such outcome cannot be interpreted solely by the inability to keep PARP-driven DNA repair in check. The focus of studies on PARP-driven tumorigenesis have recently been shifted toward PARP-dependent regulation of transcription. Here we utilized the controlled overexpression of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), a sole pADPr-degrading enzyme, to investigate pADPr-dependent gene regulation in prostate cancer PC-3 cells. We demonstrated that PARG upregulation reduces pADPr levels and inhibits the expression of genes in key tumor-promoted pathways, including TNFα/NF-kB, IL6/STAT3, MYC, and KRAS signaling, the genes involved in inflammation response, especially chemokines, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition.

This process is thought to be reversable, however to-date evidence of this has been demonstrated in small-cell prostate cancer. To study the plasticity of prostate tumours, we look to clinical cohorts of patients covering the spectra of malignancy subtypes and utilise in vitro and in vivo models of disease progression. Current models have assisted in the understanding of the extremities of this plasticity, elucidating internal mechanisms and adaptations to stressors through transition to altered cell states. By interrogating the tumour microenvironment and earlier time points, we are beginning to form a deeper understanding of the full spectra of tumour plasticity. It could be proffered that this deeper understanding will lead to better patient outcome, with earlier interventions more likely to reverse plasticity and prevent trans-differentiation to the aggressive, small cell phenotype.""","""['Alison M Ferguson', 'Mark A Rubin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Lineage plasticity in cancer: a shared pathway of therapeutic resistance.', 'The Role of Lineage Plasticity in Prostate Cancer Therapy Resistance.', 'Understanding and targeting prostate cancer cell heterogeneity and plasticity.', 'Alterations in the methylome of the stromal tumour microenvironment signal the presence and severity of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of Lineage Plasticity to and from a Neuroendocrine Phenotype on Progression and Response in Prostate and Lung Cancers.']"""

However, little is known about the impact of financial toxicity on cancer screening. We examined the effects of financial toxicity on the use of screening tests for prostate and colon cancer. We hypothesized that greater financial hardship would show an association with decreased prevalence of cancer screening.  Methods:   This cross-sectional survey-based US study included men and women aged ≥50 years from the National Health Interview Survey database from January through December 2018. A financial hardship score (FHS) between 0 and 10 was formulated by summarizing the responses from 10 financial toxicity dichotomic questions (yes or no), with a higher score associated with greater financial hardship. Primary outcomes were self-reported occurrence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood testing and colonoscopy for prostate and colon cancer screening, respectively.  Results:   Overall, 13,439 individual responses were collected. A total of 9,277 (69.03%) people had undergone colonoscopies, and 3,455 (70.94%) men had a PSA test. White, married, working men were more likely to undergo PSA testing and colonoscopy. Individuals who had not had a PSA test or colonoscopy had higher mean FHSs than those who underwent these tests (0.70 and 0.79 vs 0.47 and 0.61, respectively; P≤.001 for both). Multivariable logistic regression models demonstrated that a higher FHS was associated with a decreased odds ratio for having a PSA test (0.916; 95% CI, 0.867-0.967; P=.002) and colonoscopy (0.969; 95% CI, 0.941-0.998; P=.039).

To facilitate and widen the adoption of in silico trials, InSilicoTrials Technologies has developed a cloud-based platform, hosting healthcare simulation tools for different bench, preclinical and clinical evaluations, and for diverse disease areas. This paper discusses four use cases of in silico trials performed using the InSilicoTrials.com platform. The first application illustrates how in silico approaches can improve the early preclinical assessment of drug-induced cardiotoxicity risks. The second use case is a virtual reproduction of a bench test for the safety assessment of transcatheter heart valve substitutes.

Current clinical detection protocols for PTHrP are immunoradiometric assay and radioimmunoassay but are not sensitive enough to detect PTHrPs at early stages. We recently evaluated a prostate cancer biomarker panel, including serum monocyte differentiation antigen (CD-14), ETS-related gene protein, pigment epithelial-derived factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1, with promise for identifying aggressive prostate cancers. This panel predicted the need for patient biopsy better than PSA alone. In the present paper, we report an ultrasensitive microfluidic assay for PTHrPs and evaluate their diagnostic value and the value of including them with our prior biomarker panel to diagnose aggressive forms of prostate cancer. The immunoarray features screen-printed carbon sensor electrodes coated with 5 nm glutathione gold nanoparticles with capture antibodies attached. PTHrPs are bound to a secondary antibody attached to a polyhorseradish peroxidase label and delivered to the sensors to provide high sensitivity when activated by H2O2 and a mediator. We obtained an unprecedented 0.3 fg mL-1 limit of detection for PTHrP bioactive moieties PTHrP 1-173 and PTHrP 1-86. We also report the first study of PTHrPs in a large serum pool to identify aggressive malignancies. In assays of 130 human patient serum samples, PTHrP levels distinguished between aggressive and indolent prostate cancers with 83-91% clinical sensitivity and 78-96% specificity. Logistic regression identified the best predictive model as a combination of PTHrP 1-86 and vascular endothelial growth factor-D. PTHrP 1-173 alone also showed a high ability to differentiate aggressive and indolent cancers.""","""['Lasangi Dhanapala', 'Sophie Joseph', 'Abby L Jones', 'Shirin Moghaddam', 'Norman Lee', 'Richard B Kremer', 'James F Rusling']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Cancer Diagnostics via Ultrasensitive Multiplexed Detection of Parathyroid Hormone-Related Peptides with a Microfluidic Immunoarray.', 'Sub-zeptomole Detection of Biomarker Proteins Using a Microfluidic Immunoarray with Nanostructured Sensors.', 'Prostate Cancer Diagnosis in the Clinic Using an 8-Protein Biomarker Panel.', 'Granin-A, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and calcitonin gene products in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Prostate secretory protein of 94 amino acids (PSP-94) and its peptide (PCK3145) as potential therapeutic modalities for prostate cancer.', 'Multiplexed electrochemical assays for clinical applications.']"""

Materials and methods:   This was a single-center, phase II study.  Inclusion criteria:   prostate cancer International Society of Urological Pathology grade 1-2, prostate specific antigen ≤15 ng/ml, ≤cT2b. Patients were selected based on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and transperineal systematic and targeted magnetic resonance imaging-ultrasound fusion-guided biopsy. Ablation of index lesions with safety margin was performed. Primary end point was cancer control, defined as the absence of any biopsy-proven tumor. A control transperineal biopsy was planned at 12 months and when suspected based on prostate specific antigen and/or multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging information. Quality of life was assessed using Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Urinary Continence domain, International Index of Erectile Function, and International Prostate Symptom Score.

Materials and methods:   We identified 1,969 men with Grade Group 1 prostate cancer and at least 1 follow-up biopsy. A time-dependent Cox model and a logistic regression model were used to assess the association between biopsy-detected perineural invasion and grade reclassification (defined as the detection of Grade Group ≥2 prostate cancer on a surveillance biopsy), and adverse pathology (defined as Grade Group ≥3 ± seminal vesicle invasion ± lymph node involvement) at radical prostatectomy, respectively.  Results:   The 198 men with perineural invasion detected during active surveillance had lower rates of grade reclassification-free survival than those without perineural invasion (P < .001). On multivariable analysis perineural invasion was significantly associated with grade reclassification (HR 3.25, 95% CI 2.54-4.16, P < .001); an association that persisted in the multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging subset. At radical prostatectomy, men with biopsy-detected perineural invasion had more extraprostatic extension than men without perineural invasion (Relative Risk 1.71, 95% CI 1.15-2.56). However, on multivariable analysis biopsy-detected perineural invasion was not associated with adverse pathology (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.27-1.68, P = .40) and these patients did not exhibit more biochemical recurrence at 5 years (P > .05).  Conclusions:   Perineural invasion during active surveillance was associated with grade reclassification. At radical prostatectomy biopsy-detected perineural invasion patients exhibited more extraprostatic extension but biopsy-detected perineural invasion was not independently associated with more adverse pathology. In addition, these patients did not have more biochemical recurrence during follow-up. Perineural invasion should not preclude Grade Group 1 patients from active surveillance but they may warrant more stringent monitoring.""","""['Claire M de la Calle', 'Mufaddal M Mamawala', 'Patricia Landis', 'Katarzyna J Macura', 'Bruce J Trock', 'Jonathan I Epstein', 'Christian P Pavlovich']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Identifying Men Who Can Remain on Active Surveillance Despite Biopsy Reclassification to Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer.', 'Selecting Patients with Favorable Risk, Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer for Active Surveillance-Does Magnetic Resonance Imaging Have a Role?', 'Older Age Predicts Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy Grade Reclassification to Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Prostate cancer reporting: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.']"""

Germline heterozygous PTEN gene alterations also underlie PTEN hamartoma tumour syndrome (PHTS), a rare human cancer-predisposition condition. A key feature of systemic PTEN deregulation is the inability to adequately dampen PI3-kinase (PI3K)/mTORC1 signalling. PI3K/mTORC1 pathway inhibitors such as rapamycin are therefore expected to neutralise the impact of PTEN loss, rendering this a more druggable context compared with those of other tumour suppressor pathways such as loss of TP53. However, this has not been explored in cancer prevention in a model of germline cancer predisposition, such as PHTS. Clinical trials of short-term treatment with rapamycin have recently been initiated for PHTS, focusing on cognition and colon polyposis. Here, we administered a low dose of rapamycin from the age of 6 weeks onwards to mice with heterozygous germline Pten loss, a mouse model that recapitulates most characteristics of human PHTS. Rapamycin was well tolerated and led to a highly significant improvement of survival in both male and female mice. This was accompanied by a delay in, but not full blockade of, the development of a range of proliferative lesions, including gastro-intestinal and thyroid tumours and endometrial hyperplasia, with no impact on mammary and prostate tumours, and no effect on brain overgrowth. Our data indicate that rapamycin may have cancer prevention potential in human PHTS. This might also be the case for sporadic cancers in which genetic PI3K pathway activation is an early event in tumour development, such as endometrial cancer and some breast cancers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a long-term treatment of a germline cancer predisposition model with a PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor. © 2022 The Authors.

Recent studies have shown that AS has anti-cancer functions in ovarian and breast cancer. However, the effects of AS on prostate cancer (PCa) proliferation remain unknown. Therefore, we investigated the role of AS in PCa proliferation through apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation in PCa cell lines. Our results showed that Antrodia salmonea extract (ASE) inhibited PCa cells growth with a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ASE decreased the anchorage-independent growth formation ability in PC3 cells. Moreover, ASE-induced cell growth inhibition in PCa cells (DU145, PC3) was correlated to decreased cell cycle-related proteins such as cyclin A/B and cyclin-dependent kinase CDK1/2/4, and increased cell cycle inhibitor proteins p21. Besides, ASE decreased the total protein level of epidermal growth factor receptor and its downstream signaling pathways Akt and Erk in both PCa cells.

The recommended dosing regimen is a 360-mg loading dose followed by a 120-mg daily dose. Relugolix and testosterone concentration data and clinical information from two phase I studies, two phase II studies, and the phase III safety and efficacy study (HERO) were used to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) model and a semimechanistic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PopPK/PD) model that characterized relugolix exposure and its relationship to testosterone concentrations. Age, body weight, and Black/African American race had at most minimal effects on relugolix exposure or testosterone concentrations with no clinical relevance. Simulations using the PopPK/PD model confirmed the recommended dosing regimen of relugolix, with the median simulated testosterone concentrations predicted to achieve castration levels (< 50 ng/dL) and profound castration levels (< 20 ng/dL) by day 2 and day 9, respectively, and demonstrated that 97.3% and 85.5% of the patients remained at castration levels (< 50 ng/dL) upon temporary interruption of treatment for 7 days and 14 days, respectively. Collectively, simulations based on the PopPK and PopPK/PD models were consistent with actual data from clinical studies, reflecting the high predictiveness of the models and supporting the reliability of model-based simulations.

The results were verified by analysis of the data from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) microarray database, and the molecular pathways were identified by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). The CIBERPORT algorithm was used to identify the correlations between Mybl2 expression and tumor microenvironment of PCa. We also tested the effects of MYBL2 knockdown on proliferation and invasion of PCa cell lines using cell counting kit-8 and Transwell assays and observed the growth of PC3 cell xenograft with MYBL2 knockdown in nude mice and the expression levels of Ki-67 in the xenograft using immunohistochemistry.  Results: Mybl2 expression was significantly elevated in PCa tissues in close correlation with Gleason score and clinical and pathological stage of the tumor (P < 0.01) but not with the patients' age. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated a significant negative correlation of high Mybl2 expression with recurrence-free survival (P < 0.05), but not with the overall survival of the patients. The data from TCGA suggested that clinical and pathological stages were independent prognostic factors for recurrence-free survival, and our data indicated that clinical stage and Gleason score were independent prognostic factors of PCa (P < 0.05). GSEA suggested that Mybl2 expression was related with the pathways involving immune function, cell adhesion, and cytokine secretion; CIBERPORT analysis suggested the involvement of Mybl2 expression with memory B cells and resting mast cells (P < 0.05). In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, MYBL2 knockdown significantly inhibited cell proliferation and invasion (P < 0.05); in the tumor-bearing nude mice, the xenografts derived from PC-3 cells with MYBL2 knockdown exhibited a lowered mean tumor weight and positivity rate for Ki67 (P < 0.05).

However, the role and molecular mechanism underlying METTL3-mediated m6A modification of MALAT1 in PCa remain undocumented. The association of METTL3 and MALAT1 expression with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in patients with PCa was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, and public The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. The in vitro and in vivo experiments were executed to investigate the role of METTL3 in PCa. m6A dot blot, methylated RNA immunoprecipitation (MeRIP), RIP, and qRT-PCR assays were employed to observe METTL3-mediated m6A modification of MALAT1. The effects of METTL3 on MALAT1-mediated PI3K/AKT pathway were assessed by Western blot analysis. As a result, we found that METTL3 was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and high expression of METTL3 was associated with Gleason score and tumor recurrence in patients with PCa. Knockdown of METTL3 markedly repressed growth and invasion of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, whereas ectopic expression of METTL3 showed the opposite effects. Moreover, knockdown of METTL3 decreased the total m6A levels of PCa cells as well as the MALAT1 m6A levels, leading to reduced MALAT1 expression. Overexpression of MALAT1 reversed METTL3 knockdown-induced antitumor effects and PI3K/AKT signaling inactivation. MALAT1 harbored a positive correlation with METTL3 expression and tumor recurrence in PCa.

Methods:   A total of 202 lesions (97 transitional zone lesions and 105 peripheral zone lesions) from 198 people were investigated retrospectively using traditional MRI and magic images. Each lesion has a unique pathological consequence. Lesions T1, T2, and PD values were employed as magic observation markers. The locations of the lesions were aggregated, and the paired t-test and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were employed to find the indices with statistical significance in separating benign from malignant prostatic nodules (+1 point) and (-1 point) respectively. Draw a ROC curve and compare it to the PI-RADS v2.1 score using the magic positive and negative indices as well as the PI-RADS v2.1 score. By comparing the ROC curves scored separately, the diagnostic efficiency of the two scoring approaches for benign and malignant prostate lesions was investigated.  Results:   T2 value has the highest diagnostic efficiency among the magic observation indices. T2 value of 77 ms for transitional zone lesions and T2 value of 89 ms for peripheral zone lesions are positive indices, whereas T2 value >77 ms and T2 value >89 ms are negative indexes. PI-RADS v2.1 combines one score and magic. In the transitional zone, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the two scoring methods were 57.52, 87.70, 76.70, and 74.6 percent and 82.50, 73.68, 95.5, and 74.7 percent, respectively, and the AUC values were 0.735 and 0.846, respectively (P = 0.004); in the peripheral zone, the AUC values were 86.15 percent, 68.42 percent, 82.4.

Despite higher incidence and mortality rates of prostate cancer in men of African descent, much of what is known about cancer genetics comes from populations of European descent. To understand how well genetic predictions perform in different populations, we evaluated test characteristics of PRS from three previous studies using data from the UK Biobank and a novel dataset of 1298 prostate cancer cases and 1333 controls from Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa.  Results:   Allele frequency differences cause predicted risks of prostate cancer to vary across populations. However, natural selection is not the primary driver of these differences. Comparing continental datasets, we find that polygenic predictions of case vs. control status are more effective for European individuals (AUC 0.608-0.707, OR 2.37-5.71) than for African individuals (AUC 0.502-0.585, OR 0.95-2.01). Furthermore, PRS that leverage information from African Americans yield modest AUC and odds ratio improvements for sub-Saharan African individuals. These improvements were larger for West Africans than for South Africans. Finally, we find that existing PRS are largely unable to predict whether African individuals develop aggressive forms of prostate cancer, as specified by higher tumor stages or Gleason scores.  Conclusions:   Genetic predictions of prostate cancer perform poorly if the study sample does not match the ancestry of the original GWAS.

Here, we identified increased CAFs and YAP1 expression levels in patients with metastatic PCa. In the cultured PCa cell line LNCaP, co-culture with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could upregulate YAP1 protein expression. Either ectopic overexpression of YAP1 or co-culture with CAFs could promote the infiltration of LNCaPs towards dorsal root ganglia (DRG). This effect could be blocked using an YAP1 inhibitor. In vivo, overexpression of YAP1 could increase PNI in a mouse model of sciatic nerve tumor invasion. Mechanistically, TEAD1 binds to the NGF promotor and YAP1/TEAD1 activates its transcription and consequently increases NGF secretion. In turn, PCa cells treated with CM from CAFs or stable YAP1 overexpression can stimulate DRG to secrete CCL2. The epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of PCa cells is thus activated via CCL2/CCR2. Overall, our data demonstrate that CAFs can activate YAP1/TEAD1 signaling and increase the secretion of NGF, therefore promoting PCa PNI. In addition, EMT induced by PNI suggests a feedback loop is present between neurons and PCa cells.""","""['Tianyu Shen', 'Yang Li', 'Dekun Wang', 'Yu Su', 'Gang Li', 'Zhiqun Shang', 'Yuanjie Niu', 'Xiaoyue Tan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Basis Dis""","""['YAP1 plays a key role of the conversion of normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts that contribute to prostate cancer progression.', 'YAP1/TEAD1 upregulate platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta to promote vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and neointima formation.', 'SNHG16 upregulation-induced positive feedback loop with YAP1/TEAD1 complex in Colorectal Cancer cell lines facilitates liver metastasis of colorectal cancer by modulating CTCs epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'The nerve growth factor-delivered signals in prostate cancer and its associated microenvironment: when the dialogue replaces the monologue.', 'Important Cells and Factors from Tumor Microenvironment Participated in Perineural Invasion.', 'Advances in landscape and related therapeutic targets of the prostate tumor microenvironment.']"""

Patients and methods:   Phase II, randomised, open-label study conducted in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. After open-label treatment with AAP, patients who had experienced cancer progression to AAP were randomised to 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel plus AAP or to receive 75 mg/m2 of docetaxel plus 10 mg of prednisone orally daily. The primary outcome was the radiographic progression-free survival rate at 12 months as evaluated by the investigators in all randomised patients.  Results:   A total of 148 patients were included in open-label treatment with AAP, and of them, 94 patients were randomised to receive either docetaxel plus AAP (intervention group; n = 47) or docetaxel plus prednisone (control group; n = 47). The 12-month radiographic progression-free survival rates did not differ between the intervention group (34.9%; 95% CI 20.7-49.2) and the control group (33.9%; 95% CI 19.5-48.3). There were no significant differences in the time to radiographic progression and the overall survival between the intervention and control groups.

Herein, we designed several lasso-like self-assembling anticancer peptides (LASAPs) integrated with multiple functions by a computer-aided approach. Among these LASAPs, LASAP1 (CRGDKGPDCGKAFRRFLGALFKALSHLL, 1-9 disulfide bond) was determined to be superior to the others because it can self-assemble into homogeneous nanoparticles and exhibits improved stability in serum. Thus, LASAP1 was chosen for proving the design idea. LASAP1 can self-assemble into nanoparticles displaying iRGD on the surface because of its amphiphilic structure and accumulate to the tumor site after injection because of the EPR effect and iRGD targeting to αVβ3 integrin. The nanoparticles could disassemble in the acidic microenvironment of the solid tumor, and cleaved by the overexpressed hK2, which was secreted by prostate tumor cells, to release the effector peptide PTP-7b (FLGALFKALSHLL), which was further activated by the acidic pH. Therefore, LASAP1 could target the orthotopic prostate tumor in the model mice after intraperitoneal injection and specifically inhibit tumor growth, with low systematic toxicity.

However, chemoresistance leading to treatment failure is inevitable. Thus, therapeutic approaches that can overcome chemoresistance are important areas of research for cancer chemotherapy.  Materials and methods:   In the present study, six components of tripterygium wilfordii including celastrol, triptolide, pristimerin, triptonide, demethylzeylasteral, and wilforlide A were screened for their chemosensitizing effect on drug-resistant prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145. The most active compound was further investigated on its potential mechanism of action and in vivo efficacy using a SCID mouse model.  Results:   Among the six components only wilforlide A significantly enhanced sensitivity to docetaxel (by reducing the IC50 in resistant prostate cancer cell lines). Wilforlide A inhibited P-glycoprotein efflux transporter and downregulated cyclin E2 splice variant 1 mRNA, both have been known as mechanisms of resistance. The chemosensitizing effect was further verified using a xenograft mouse model. In the high-dose treatment group, the combination of wilforlide A and docetaxel significantly retarded tumor growth of resistant prostate cancer, although neither docetaxel nor wilforlide A monotreatment groups showed any effect.

Results:   The cohorts included 105 255 breast, 23 571 colorectal, 11 321 lung, and 59 197 prostate cancer patients. For patients diagnosed between 2009 and 2016, total mean costs per patient increased from $109 544 to $140 732 for breast (29%), $151 751 to $168 730 for lung (11%) or $53 300 to $55 497 for prostate (4%) cancer were statistically significant. Increase for colorectal cancer (1%, $136 652 to $137 663) was not statistically significant (P = .09).

Use of IV systemic therapy and radiation statistically significantly increased, except for lung cancer. Cancer surgeries statistically significantly increased for breast and colorectal cancer but decreased for prostate cancer (P &lt; .001). Total costs increased statistically significantly for nearly all treatment modalities, except for IV systemic therapy in colorectal and radiation in prostate cancer.

Furthermore, the protein level of CIP2A was positively correlated with patients' short survival time and nuclear AR levels in PCa tissues. Compared to PZ-HPV-7, an immortalized prostate cell line, androgen-sensitive LNCaP C-33, androgen-independent LNCaP C-81, or 22Rv1 cells exhibited a high CIP2A level, associated with high protein and phosphorylation levels of AR. While AR expression and activity modulated CIP2A expression, manipulating CIP2A expression in PCa cells regulated their AR protein levels and proliferation. The reduction of CIP2A expression also enhanced the sensitivity of PCa cells toward Enzalutamide treatment. Our data further showed that depletion of polo-kinase 1 (PLK1) expression or activity in C-81 or 22Rv1 cells caused reduced protein levels of c-Myc and AR. Notably, inhibition of PLK1 activity could abolish CIP2A-promoted expressions in c-Myc, AR, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in C-33 cells under an androgen-deprived condition, suggesting the role of PLK1 activity in CIP2A-promoted AR expression.

Then ""blinded"" urologist obtained transrectal cognitive biopsy Clinically significant cancer was defined as ISUP more or equal 2.  Results:   We enrolled 96 patients. Median age was 63 years, prostate volume - 47 cm3 and PSA - 6.82 ng/mL. MpMR/US fusion and cognitive biopsies were comparable in regard to the detection rate of clinically significant (32.3% vs 25.0%; p=0.264), clinically insignificant cancer (25.0% and 26.0%; p=0.869) and overall detection rate (57.3% and 51%;p=0.385). Both biopsies missed clinically significant cancer with equal frequency (5.2%; p=0.839). Histological efficacy also was comparable. The number of positive cores between mpMR/US fusion and cognitive biopsy was equal (34.1% and 31.1% respectively; p= 0.415). At the same time, no statistically significant difference was found with respect to maximum cancer core length (53.1% vs 47.7%, respectively; p=0.293).  Conclusion:   The results suggest that both cognitive and mpMR/US fusion biopsies are equally accurate diagnostic methods for clinically significant prostate cancer detection, thus their wider introduction into clinical practice is necessary.""","""['V S Petov', 'A K Bazarkin', 'A O Morozov', 'M S Taratkin', 'T M Ganzha', 'S P Danilov', 'Y N Chernov', 'D V Chinenov', 'A V Amosov', 'D V Enikeev', 'G E Krupinov']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Transperineal Versus Transrectal MRI/TRUS Fusion Targeted Biopsy: Detection Rate of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'A Multicentre Analysis of the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Following Transperineal Image-fusion Targeted and Nontargeted Systematic Prostate Biopsy in Men at Risk.', 'Accuracy of Transperineal Targeted Prostate Biopsies, Visual Estimation and Image Fusion in Men Needing Repeat Biopsy in the PICTURE Trial.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy: A Systematic Review.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Posterior reconstruction of urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA) is one of the techniques that provides early recovery of urinary continence after surgery. Changes in the technique of performing posterior reconstruction of UVA may contribute to further improvement of functional results.  Aim:   To evaluate the functional results of early removal of the urethral catheter (after 3 days) after RARP using a modified surgical technique of performing posterior reconstruction of UVA compared with the standard catheterization time (7 days after surgery).  Materials and methods:   Patients who underwent RARP were randomly assigned to early catheter removal (3 days after surgery, main group, n=15) and standard catheterization time (7 days after surgery, control group, n=15). RARP was performed using the Da Vinci Si system. The primary end point was the rate of spontaneous voiding after catheter removal. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of urine leakage into the paravesical tissue during retrograde cystography, as well as complications according to the Clavien-Dindo system. The frequency and severity of stress urinary incontinence after catheter removal was assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF).  Results:   There were no significant differences between groups in terms of baseline and perioperative parameters. After removal of the catheter, no acute urinary retention was observed in both groups. Also, there were no cases of urine leakage into the paravesical tissue during retrograde cystography. The ICIQ-UI SF questionnaire showed no significant differences between the groups at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery.  Conclusions:   The method of modified posterior reconstruction allows to remove the urethral catheter 3 days after RARP. Early removal of the urethral catheter did not adversely affect the early recovery of urinary continence, the quality of UVA, and did not increase the incidence of acute urinary retention. Further studies with longer follow-up periods are needed.""","""['M A Kodzokov', 'E V Shpot', 'G N Akopyan', 'A V Proskura', 'E N Gasanov', 'M A Gazimiev']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""['Early Catheter Removal after Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Surgical Technique and Outcomes for the Aalst Technique (ECaRemA Study).', 'Influence of modified posterior reconstruction of the rhabdosphincter on early recovery of continence and anastomotic leakage rates after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Using the Novel Urethral Fixation Technique Versus Standard Vesicourethral Anastomosis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Posterior musculofascial reconstruction after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of the literature.']"""

BRCA2 maintains genome stability through homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication fork protection. Nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to truncation of the BRCA2 protein are typically considered pathogenic; however, missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions can be challenging to functionally interpret. The majority of missense mutations in BRCA2 have been classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) with unknown functional consequences. In this study, we identified three BRCA2 VUS located within the BRC repeat region to determine their impact on canonical HDR and fork protection functions. We provide evidence that S1221P and T1980I, which map to conserved residues in the BRC2 and BRC7 repeats, compromise the cellular response to chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation, and display deficits in fork protection. We further demonstrate biochemically that S1221P and T1980I disrupt RAD51 binding and diminish the ability of BRCA2 to stabilize RAD51-ssDNA complexes. The third variant, T1346I, located within the spacer region between BRC2 and BRC3 repeats, is fully functional. We conclude that T1346I is a benign allele, whereas S1221P and T1980I are hypomorphic disrupting the ability of BRCA2 to fully engage and stabilize RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Our results underscore the importance of correctly classifying BRCA2 VUS as pathogenic variants can impact both future cancer risk and guide therapy selection during cancer treatment.""","""['Judit Jimenez-Sainz', 'Joshua Mathew', 'Gemma Moore', 'Sudipta Lahiri', 'Jennifer Garbarino', 'Joseph P Eder', 'Eli Rothenberg', 'Ryan B Jensen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Elife""","""['Distinct binding of BRCA2 BRC repeats to RAD51 generates differential DNA damage sensitivity.', 'Stabilization of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments by the C-terminal region of BRCA2.', 'Breast cancer-associated missense mutants of the PALB2 WD40 domain, which directly binds RAD51C, RAD51 and BRCA2, disrupt DNA repair.', 'Imprecise Medicine: BRCA2 Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS), the Challenges and Benefits to Integrate a Functional Assay Workflow with Clinical Decision Rules.', 'Single-molecule imaging brings Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments into focus.']"""

Invasive extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) is the most effective method for clinically diagnosing PLNM. Accurate preoperative prediction of PLNM can reduce unnecessary ePLND. This study aims to investigate the clinical value of radiomics nomogram in predicting PLNM of prostate cancer based on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI).  Methods:   Magnetic resonance (MR) data of 71 patients with prostate cancer who underwent ePLND from January 2017 to June 2021 in Peking University First Hospital were collected retrospectively. All patients were assigned into a training set (January 2017 to December 2020, n=56, containing 186 lymph nodes) and a test set (January 2021 to June 2021, n=15, containing 45 lymph nodes) according to the examination time of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). Two radiologists matched the dissected lymph nodes on MRI images, and manually annotated the region of interest (ROI). Based on the outlined ROI, 3 metastatic lymph node prediction models were established: Model 1 (only image features of T2WI), Model 2 (radiomics features based on random forest), and Model 3 (combination of the image and radiomics features). A nomogram was also established. The clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients were obtained from the medical records, including age, the Gleason score, the level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and clinical and pathological T stage. The preoperative radiological features of the pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) include size of LNs (the short and long diameters) and volume of LNs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the 3 models and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical benefits of the models.  Results:   No significant differences were found between the training set and test set regarding age, Gleason scores, PSA level, and clinical and pathological T stage (all P>0.05). The differences in volume, short diameter and long diameter between metastatic and non-metastatic LNs were statistically significant in both training set and test set (all P<0.05). In multivariate regression analysis, the short diameter and marginal status of LNs were included in Model 1. Eighteen omics features were selected to construct Model 2. The signal distribution of LNs and Rad score were the significant risk factors for predicting metastasis of pelvic LNs in Model 3. The C-index of nomogram based on Model 3 reached 0.964, and the calibration curve showed that the model had high calibration degree. In the test set, the area under the curves of Model 1, 2, and 3 were 0.78, 0.93, and 0.96 respectively, Model 2 and Model 3 showed significantly higher diagnostic efficiency than Model 1 (Model 1 vs Model 2, P=0.019; Model 1 vs Model 3, P=0.020). There was no significant difference in the area under the curve between Model 2 and Model 3 (P=0.649). The DCA results of the 3 models showed that all models obtained higher net benefits than the PLNM-all or PLNM-none protocol in different ranges of threshold probabilities and Model 3 had the highest clinical benefit.  Conclusions:   The radiomics nomogram based on T2WI shows a good predictive efficacy for preoperative PLNM in patients with prostate cancer, which could be served as an imaging biomarker to optimize decision-making and adjust adjuvant treatments.""","""['Xiang Liu', 'Yaofeng Zhang', 'Zhaonan Sun', 'Xiangpeng Wang', 'Xiaodong Zhang', 'Xiaoying Wang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban""","""['Utility of diffusion weighted imaging-based radiomics nomogram to predict pelvic lymph nodes metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Preoperative prediction of pelvic lymph nodes metastasis in prostate cancer using an ADC-based radiomics model: comparison with clinical nomograms and PI-RADS assessment.', 'Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify the Candidates for Extended Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiomics in colorectal cancer patients.', 'A prediction nomogram for postoperative gastroparesis syndrome in right colon cancer: a retrospective study.']"""

We compared restriction spectrum imaging (RSI-MRI) generated signal maps as a biomarker to other available non-invasive biomarkers to predict upgrading or reclassification on an AS biopsy.  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled men on prostate cancer AS undergoing repeat biopsy from January 2016 to June 2019 to obtain an MRI and biomarkers to predict upgrading. Subjects underwent a prostate multiparametric MRI and a short duration, diffusion-weighted enhanced MRI called RSI to generate a restricted signal map along with evaluation of 30 biomarkers (14 clinico-epidemiologic features, 9 molecular biomarkers, and 7 radiologic-associated features). Our primary outcome was upgrading or reclassification on subsequent AS prostate biopsy. Statistical analysis included operating characteristic improvement using AUROC and AUPRC.  Results:   The individual biomarker with the highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) was RSI-MRI (AUC = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.71-0.96). The best non-imaging biomarker was prostate volume-corrected Prostate Health Index density (PHI, AUC = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.53-0.82). Non-imaging biomarkers had a negligible effect on predicting upgrading at the next biopsy but did improve predictions of overall time to progression in AS.

Methods:   This is an exploratory analysis of LATITUDE, a phase III randomized study, in which men with de novo mCSPC were randomized to receive either ADT plus abiraterone versus ADT alone. Information was collected on patient-reported worst pain score (WPS) and pain-interference score (PIS) from the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form. A Bayesian joint modelling approach was used determine the association of dynamic change in WPS and PIS with OS and PFS.  Results:   Overall, 1125 patients with at least 3 measurements on pain scores were eligible. On Cox multivariable regression, increase in baseline WPS was associated with inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.049 [95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.015-1.085]; time dependent area under curve [tAUC] 0.64) and PFS (HR 1.045 [1.011-1.080]; tAUC: 0.64). Increase in baseline PIS was associated with inferior OS (HR 1.062 [1.020-1.105]; tAUC: 0.63) but not with PFS (HR 1.038 [0.996-1.08]). On independent joint models, an increase in the current value of WPS by 1-unit was associated with inferior OS (HR 1.316 [1.258-1.376]; tAUC 0.74) and PFS (HR 1.319 [1.260-1.382]; tAUC 0.70). Similar association was seen for increase in the current value of PIS with OS (HR 1.319 [1.261-1.381]; tAUC 0.73) and PFS (HR 1.282 [1.224-1.344]; tAUC 0.73).  Conclusions:   The above findings highlight the potential dynamic interplay between patient-reported pain with OS and PFS in mCSPC.

Diagnosis and treatment of cancer at earlier stages may reduce this burden. To better understand potential impacts of earlier diagnosis, healthcare costs among patients with cancer were assessed by cancer type and stage at diagnosis.  Methods:   A retrospective analysis was conducted using Optum's de-identified Integrated Claims-Clinical data set with Enriched Oncology, which includes data from Medicare Advantage and commercially insured members. Adult members newly diagnosed with solid tumor cancers, cancer stage at diagnosis (diagnosed 1/1/2016-6/30/2020), and continuous enrollment for at least one month post diagnosis were identified. Patients with breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, ovarian, or prostate cancer were reported. Mean standardized costs (2020 USD) were calculated in each month on an annual and cumulative basis through four years post-cancer diagnosis. In each month, costs were calculated for those with continuous enrollment and no death reported in the month. Mean annual cost per patient was estimated by summing month one to 12 mean costs and stratifying by stage at cancer diagnosis; annual year one to four costs were summed to determine cumulative costs.  Results:   Among members diagnosed 2016-2020 with breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, ovarian, or prostate cancer, 20,422 eligible members were identified. Mean costs increased by stage of diagnosis across all cancers at the annual and cumulative level through year four post diagnosis. Cumulative mean costs grew over time at a relatively similar rate across stages I to III and more dramatically in stage IV, except for cervical and lung cancer where the rate was relatively stable or slightly fluctuated across stages and ovarian cancer where stages III and IV both increased more sharply compared to stages I and II.  Conclusions:   Mean annual and cumulative healthcare costs through year four post cancer diagnosis were significantly higher among those diagnosed at later versus earlier cancer stages. The steeper increase in cumulative costs among those diagnosed in stage IV for many cancer types highlights the importance of earlier cancer diagnosis.

This association stems from the direct proximity of ePLND to the pelvic plexus. In this paper, we aimed to critically examine an association of ePLND with functional outcomes in patients who underwent bilateral nerve-sparing RPE.  Methods:   272 out of 782 patients from a randomized, patient-blinded, multicenter trial were retrospectively classified into two groups based on the D'Amico criteria: 114 had no PLND and 158 had ePLND. Continence (no pad/safety pad) and EF (Index of Erectile Function-5 [IIEF-5] questionnaire ≥17; sufficient erection for sexual intercourse) were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months as well as postsurgical complications (Clavien-Dindo Classification).  Results:   After 12 months of follow-up, no significant difference for potency could be found between men without and subjected to ePLND: IIEF-5 ≥17 (23.2% vs. 27.2%; p = 0.55) and sufficient erection for intercourse (44.1% vs. 45.6%; p = 0.84). A multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that while preoperative EF (p < 0.001), pathological tumor stage (p = 0.027), and robot-assisted bilateral nerve-sparing RPE (p < 0.001) were independent predictors of EF recovery, the same did not apply to ePLND. No association was detected for continence recovery (94.2% vs. 89.7%; p = 0.22) and complications of any grade after surgery (11.4% vs. 16.5%; p = 0.24).  Conclusion:   ePLND is not associated with increased risk of erectile dysfunction, incontinence or complications after bilateral nerve-sparing RPE.""","""['Luise Krieger', 'Sigrun Holze', 'Meinhard Mende', 'Hoang Minh Do', 'Anja Dietel', 'Toni Franz', 'Vinodh Kumar Adithyaa Arthanareeswaran', 'Jens-Uwe Stolzenburg']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Extended versus limited pelvic lymph node dissection during bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy and its effect on continence and erectile function recovery: long-term results and trifecta rates of a comparative analysis.', 'Extended pelvic lymph node dissection does not affect erectile function recovery in patients treated with bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.', 'Exploratory Decision-Tree Modeling of Data from the Randomized REACTT Trial of Tadalafil Versus Placebo to Predict Recovery of Erectile Function After Bilateral Nerve-Sparing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Extended versus Standard Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Radical Prostatectomy on Oncological and Functional Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Erectile function recovery in men treated with phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor administration after bilateral nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy: a systematic review of placebo-controlled randomized trials with trial sequential analysis.']"""

Methods:   We analyse relative 1- and 5-year survival in all solid cancers in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden through a 50-year period (1970-2019) using the NORDCAN database.  Results:   The most recent survival results showed three types of patterns. Cancers of very good survival (5-year survival ∼90%) included common cancers of the breast and prostate, as well as melanoma. The second pattern, which included the largest number of cancers, showed 1-year survival of over 80% and a drop of 10-20 % units in 5-year survival. The third group consisted of eight fatal cancers, sharing poor 5-year survival (around 20%). The 50-year improvement in 1-year survival was largest (30-50 % units) in kidney, brain, gallbladder and liver cancers, and (∼30%) in colon, small intestinal, lung, pleural, pancreas and ovarian cancers. Improvements in 5-year survival were highest (40-50 % units) in prostate and kidney cancers but remained at 10-20 % units for the eight fatal cancers. Survival showed significant sex preferences for a few cancers.  Conclusions:   The analysis over a half-century confirms the progress in 'real-world' cancer control, and in 84% of patients 5-year survival was &gt;60%. Metastases remain a challenge, placing the emphasis on early detection before metastasis occurs.

However, only DNA damage repair (DDR) genes have been investigated thoroughly in prostate cancer. To determine the comprehensive germline mutation landscape in Chinese prostate cancer patients, we performed whole exome sequencing in 100 Han Chinese patients with prostate cancer in Hong Kong and identified deleterious germline mutations. A total of 36 deleterious germline variants in 25 genes were identified in 29% patients. Variants were found in eight pathways, including DNA methylation, DDR, and tyrosine-protein kinase. These findings were validated in an independent Chinese cohort of 167 patients with prostate cancer in Shanghai. Seven common deleterious-variant-containing genes were found in discovery cohort (7/25, 28%) and validation cohort (7/28, 25%) with three genes not described before (LDLR, MYH7 and SUGCT) and four genes previously reported (FANCI, ITGA6, PABPC1 and RAD54B).

Herein, we evaluated patient-level factors associated with out-of-pocket costs for contemporary advanced prostate cancer treatment options.  Materials and methods:   We identified all commercially insured men receiving treatment for advanced prostate cancer between 2007 and 2019 within the OptumLabs Data Warehouse®. Patients were categorized into 3 treatment groups: androgen deprivation monotherapy, novel hormonal therapy, and nonandrogen systemic therapy. The primary outcome was out-of-pocket costs in the first year of treatment. The associations of treatment and patient variables with out-of-pocket costs were assessed using multivariable regression models. All costs were adjusted to reflect 2019 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index.  Results:   In a cohort of 13,409 men 81% (n = 10,926) received androgen deprivation monotherapy, 6% (n = 832) novel hormonal therapy, and 12% (n = 1,651) nonandrogen systemic therapy. Mean treatment-related out-of-pocket costs in the first year were $165, $4,236, and $994 for androgen deprivation monotherapy, novel hormonal therapy, and nonandrogen systemic therapy, respectively. The adjusted difference in annual treatment-related out-of-pocket costs for novel hormonal therapy and nonandrogen systemic therapy were $2,581 (95% CI: $1,923-$3,240) and $752 (95% CI: $600-$903) higher than androgen deprivation monotherapy, respectively. Patient characteristics associated (P < .05) with higher treatment-related out-of-pocket costs included older age (65-74 years), Black race, lower comorbidity scores, and lower household income.  Conclusions:   Patients receiving novel hormonal therapy for advanced prostate cancer had substantially higher treatment-related out-of-pocket costs. In addition to raising awareness among prescribers, these data support the inclusion of treatment associated financial toxicity in shared decision making for advanced prostate cancer and call attention to subgroups of patients particularly vulnerable to financial toxicity.""","""['Daniel D Joyce', 'Vidit Sharma', 'David H Jiang', 'Holly K Van Houten', 'Lindsey R Sangaralingham', 'Bijan J Borah', 'Eugene D Kwon', 'David F Penson', 'Stacie B Dusetzina', 'Jon C Tilburt', 'Stephen A Boorjian']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Patient time and out-of-pocket costs for long-term prostate cancer survivors in Ontario, Canada.', 'Out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Out-of-Pocket Costs and Perceived Financial Burden Associated with Prostate Cancer Treatment in a Quebec Remote Area: A Cross-Sectional Study.', 'Neo-adjuvant and adjuvant hormone therapy for localised and locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Medical therapy of prostate cancer.

Methods:   The subjects were 190 and 110 patients undergoing RARP and ORP, respectively, in our institution. Patients underwent preoperative MRI for prostate cancer evaluation and completed the quality of life questionnaire of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite instrument before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. The parameters of mRUL and MUL were measured on MRI and analyzed along with other parameters including age, body mass index, and nerve sparing.  Results:   The median mRUL and MUL were 7.81 and 14.27 mm in the RARP group and 7.15 and 13.57 mm in the ORP group, respectively. Recovery rates from PUI were similar in the two groups. Multivariate analyses showed that mRUL was a predictor of baseline continence, whereas shorter MUL was a predictor of poor recovery from PUI. Patients with both shorter mRUL and MUL had significantly worse recoveries from PUI after RARP and ORP than patients with longer mRUL and MUL.  Conclusions:   Minimal residual membranous urethral length contributes to urethral function as basal urinary continence, whereas MUL represents the potential of recovery from PUI in RARP and ORP. The MUL measured by preoperative MRI can predict poor recovery from PUI after radical prostatectomy and combined evaluation of MUL and mRUL support to anticipate poor recovery of PUI.""","""['Eiichiro Ohara', 'Naoki Kawamorita', 'Yohei Satake', 'Yasuhiro Kaiho', 'Koji Mitsuzuka', 'Hideo Saito', 'Shigeto Ishidoya', 'Yoichi Arai', 'Akihiro Ito']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment from Dr Kadonoo to Minimal residual membranous urethral length and membranous urethral length predict poor recovery from incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and after open radical prostatectomy.', 'Editorial Comment from Dr Haga et al. to Minimal residual membranous urethral length and membranous urethral length predict poor recovery from incontinence after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and after open radical prostatectomy.', 'Estimated Minimal Residual Membranous Urethral Length on Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging Can Be a New Predictor for Continence After Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Association Between Preoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Urethral Parameters and Continence Recovery Following Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Postoperative membranous urethral length is the single most important surgical factor predicting recovery of postoperative urinary continence.', 'Preoperative Membranous Urethral Length Measurement and Continence Recovery Following Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

BVA was performed according to the elaborate perineal approach for pelvic fracture urethral repair with minor modifications. After confirming the absence of recurrent stenosis 6 months postoperatively, the patients were offered artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) placement for subsequent urinary incontinence (UI).  Results:   Median patient age was 68, and the etiology of PUS was radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer in four patients, brachytherapy for prostate cancer in one, and transurethral resection of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia in one. All patients had been previously treated with multiple transurethral procedures such as urethrotomy and dilation. Median operative time and blood loss were 211 min and 154 ml, respectively. Five cases (83.3%) had no recurrent stenosis with a median follow-up of 45 months, but a single direct vision internal urethrotomy was performed in one (16.7%) due to restenosis. Four (66.7%) patients underwent AUS placement via transcorporal approach for subsequent UI, but two had it removed due to urethral erosion.

Results.—:   Group 2 was more likely to have prostatic ducts or acini involvement by urothelial carcinoma in situ component (27% versus 10%, P = .002) and prostate involvement (30% versus 13%, P = .003) than group 1. Although there were cases with prostatic stromal invasion in group 2 (14% versus 7%, P = .13), this was not statistically significant. In all, 6 cases were upstaged by subepithelial prostatic stromal invasion through intraurethral extension according to the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. Tumor location and the presence of concurrent carcinoma in situ were strongly associated with prostate involvement of urothelial carcinoma.

Subgroup analysis was performed to identify the potential effect modifiers. During a mean follow-up of 8.86 years, 387 pancreatic cancer cases occurred. High consumption of ultra-processed foods was found to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (fully adjusted HRquartile 4 vs 1 :1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-2.07; Ptrend = .021) in a linear dose-response manner (Pnonlinearity = .075). Subgroup analysis further found that the positive association of ultra-processed food consumption with the risk of pancreatic cancer was more pronounced in subjects aged <65 years (HRquartile 4 vs 1 :2.17; 95% CI: 1.14-4.15) than in those aged ≥65 years (HRquartile 4 vs 1 :1.32; 95% CI: 0.88-1.94), though the interaction test failed to achieve the statistical significance (Pinteraction = .061).

We developed a novel 6-plex reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) assay for the absolute quantification of 4 prostate cancer biomarkers, a reference gene, and a synthetic DNA external control (DNA-EC) in CTCs isolated from mCRPC patients.  Methods:   A novel 6-plex RT-ddPCR assay was developed for the simultaneous absolute quantification of AR-FL, AR-V7, PSA, and PSMA, HPRT (used as a reference gene), and a synthetic DNA-EC that was included for quality control. The assay was optimized and analytically validated using DNA synthetic standards for each transcript as positive controls. Epithelial cellular adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive CTC fractions isolated from 90 mCRPC patients and 11 healthy male donors were analyzed, and results were directly compared with reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for all markers in all samples.  Results:   Linear dynamic range, limit of detection, limit of quantification, intra- and interassay precision, and analytical specificity were determined for each marker. Application of the assay in EpCAM-positive CTC showed positivity for AR-FL (71/90; 78.9%), AR-V7 (28/90; 31.1%), PSA (41/90; 45.6%), PSMA (38/90; 42.2%), and HPRT (90/90; 100%); DNA-EC concentration was constant across all samples. Direct comparison with RT-qPCR for the same markers in the same samples revealed RT-ddPCR to have superior diagnostic sensitivity.  Conclusions:   Our 6-plex RT-ddPCR assay was highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible, and enabled simultaneous and absolute quantification of 5 gene transcripts in minute amounts of CTC-derived cDNA.

Summary-level data on overall and six digestive tract cancers, including esophageal, stomach, liver, biliary tract, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, were obtained from the UK Biobank (11 952 cases) and FinnGen (7638 cases) study. Genetic liability to morning chronotype was associated with reduced risk of overall digestive tract cancer and cancers of stomach, biliary tract and colorectum in UK Biobank. The associations for the overall digestive tract, stomach and colorectal cancers were directionally replicated in FinnGen. In the meta-analysis of the two sources, genetic liability to morning chronotype was associated with a decreased risk of overall digestive tract cancer (odds ratio [OR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90-0.98), stomach cancer (OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73-0.97) and colorectal cancer (OR 0.92, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98), but not with the other studied cancers.

Methods:   Exosomes were extracted from the primary colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines HCT116 and SW480 and cultured with T84 and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells. The expression of PCAT1 and miR-329-3p was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), the expression of Netrin-1, CD146, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) related proteins was detected by Western blot, the proliferation activity of T84 cells was detected by cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8), and cell migration was detected by Transwell. The expression of the F-actin signal was detected by immunofluorescence after coculture of exosomes with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Changes in subcutaneous tumor and liver nodule size after PCAT1 deletion were observed in a mouse model of liver metastasis from rectal cancer.  Results:   PCAT1 expression was upregulated in primary cell lines and their exosomes. After exosomes were cocultured with colorectal cancer tumor circulating T84 cells, the expression of Netrin-1 and CD146 was upregulated, the expression of miR-329-3p was downregulated, the proliferation and migration ability of T84 cells were enhanced, and EMT occurred. After knocking down PCAT1, the above phenomenon was reversed. Similarly, after exosomes were cocultured with HUVECs, the expression of the F-actin signal increased, and after PCAT1 was knocked down, the F-actin signal also decreased. PCAT1 regulates miR-329-3p/Netrin-1 and affects the biological behavior of T84 and F-actin signal expression in HUVECs. In a mouse model of colorectal cancer liver metastasis, knocking down PCAT1 significantly reduced the nodules formed by liver metastasis in mice.  Conclusions:   LncRNA PCAT1 derived from colorectal cancer exosomes regulates the activity of the Netrin-1-CD146 complex in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to promote the occurrence of colorectal cancer EMT and liver metastasis and provides new molecular targets for the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastasis.""","""['Xingbao Fang', 'Yongping Xu', 'Kezhi Li', 'Peiwan Liu', 'Hong Zhang', 'Yang Jiang', 'Jianwei Tang', 'Yuehong Li']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Immunol Res""","""['CAFs secreted exosomes promote metastasis and chemotherapy resistance by enhancing cell stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer.', 'EMT-cancer cells-derived exosomal miR-27b-3p promotes circulating tumour cells-mediated metastasis by modulating vascular permeability in colorectal cancer.', 'Exosomal lncRNA H19 promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma treated with Propofol via miR-520a-3p/LIMK1 axis.', 'The value of exosome-derived noncoding RNAs in colorectal cancer proliferation, metastasis, and clinical applications.', 'Exosomes in Colorectal Cancer: From Physiology to Clinical Applications.', 'Progress of regulatory RNA in small extracellular vesicles in colorectal cancer.', 'Crosstalk between colorectal cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment mediated by exosomal noncoding RNAs.', 'Connection of Cancer Exosomal LncRNAs, Sponging miRNAs, and Exosomal Processing and Their Potential Modulation by Natural Products.', 'Exosomal LncRNAs in Gastrointestinal Cancer: Biological Functions and Emerging Clinical Applications.', ""Exosomal long non-coding RNAs: novel molecules in gastrointestinal cancers' progression and diagnosis.""]"""

In this study, we sought to study the discordance of imaging with PSA kinetics in mCRPC patients on second generation anti-androgens (SGA) post-chemotherapy using combined conventional imaging, and new generation imaging in the form of C-11 choline positron emission tomography/computed tomography (C[11] choline PET/CT) scan.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 123 patients with mCRPC treated with SGA (Abiraterone or Enzalutamide) after docetaxel between 2016 and 2019. Patients underwent PSA testing, and C[11] choline PET/CT scan at baseline level before starting treatment with SGA, then every 3-6 months as part of their follow up evaluation. Loss of response to SGA was defined by increase in corrected maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of pretreatment lesions on C-11 Choline PET/CT, and/or development of new lesions. Suspicious new lesions were confirmed by biopsy and/or conventional imaging.  Results:   We identified 123 mCRPC patients who received SGA (Abiraterone, n = 106; Enzalutamide, n = 17) after docetaxel. Median duration of therapy was 13.9 months (interquartile range: 8.75-21.14). Approximately 43% (n = 53) of subjects in this study exhibited an increase in choline avidity while on SGA. Of this group, 60.4% of patients experienced a parallel rise in PSA (Group-A), whereas 39.6% displayed a paradoxical response (PR) (Group-B), defined as increased choline avidity combined with stable or down-trending PSA. Median PSA at time of increase in choline avidity was 3.1 ng/ml for Group-A, and 1.3 ng/ml for Group-B (p = 0.0176). Median SUVmax was similar in both groups (4.9 for Group-A, 4.6 for Group-B; p = 0.6072). The median time for increase in choline avidity was 9.5 versus 3.9 months for Group-A versus Group-B, respectively (Log-Rank = 0.0063).

However, patients remain at a high risk with a PSADT of >6 mo.  Objective:   To evaluate the efficacy and safety of darolutamide versus placebo in patients stratified by PSADT >6 or ≤6 mo.  Design, setting, and participants:   A planned subgroup analysis of a global multicenter, double-blind, randomized, phase 3 trial in men with nmCRPC and PSADT ≤10 mo was conducted.  Intervention:   Patients were randomized 2:1 to oral darolutamide 600 mg twice daily or placebo, while continuing androgen-deprivation therapy.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was metastasis-free survival (MFS). Secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and times to pain progression, first cytotoxic chemotherapy, and symptomatic skeletal events. Quality of life (QoL) was measured using validated prostate-relevant tools. Safety was recorded throughout the study.  Results and limitations:   Of 1509 patients enrolled, 469 had PSADT >6 mo (darolutamide n = 286; placebo n = 183) and 1040 had PSADT ≤6 mo (darolutamide n = 669; placebo n = 371). Baseline characteristics were balanced between subgroups. Darolutamide significantly prolonged MFS versus placebo in both subgroups (unstratified hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: PSADT >6 mo, 0.38 [0.26-0.55]; PSADT ≤6 mo, 0.41 [0.33-0.52]). OS and other efficacy and QoL endpoints favored darolutamide with significant improvement over placebo in both subgroups. The incidence of adverse events, including events commonly associated with androgen receptor inhibitors (fractures, falls, hypertension, and mental impairment), and discontinuations due to adverse events were low and similar to placebo. Limitations include small subgroup populations.  Conclusions:   In patients with nmCRPC and PSADT >6 mo (maximum 10 mo), darolutamide provided a favorable benefit/risk ratio, characterized by significant improvements in MFS, OS, and other clinically relevant endpoints; maintenance of QoL; and favorable tolerability.  Patient summary:   In patients with prostate cancer that has stopped responding to standard hormonal therapy (indicated by an increase in prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels), there is a risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body. This risk is highest when the time it takes for the PSA level to double (ie, ""PSA doubling time"" [PSADT]) is less than 6 mo. However, there is still a risk that the cancer will spread even if the PSADT is longer than 6 mo. In a group of patients whose PSADT was more than 6 mo but no more than 10 mo, treatment with darolutamide slowed the cancer spread and allowed them to live longer than patients who received placebo (inactive drug). Darolutamide treatment did not cause many side effects and helped maintain patients' quality of life without disruptions.""","""['Martin Bögemann', 'Neal D Shore', 'Matthew R Smith', 'Teuvo L J Tammela', 'Albertas Ulys', 'Egils Vjaters', 'Sergey Polyakov', 'Mindaugas Jievaltas', 'Murilo Luz', 'Boris Alekseev', 'Thierry Lebret', 'Martin Schostak', 'Frank Verholen', 'Marie-Aude Le Berre', 'Shankar Srinivasan', 'Jorge Ortiz', 'Ateesha F Mohamed', 'Toni Sarapohja', 'Karim Fizazi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Erratum to ""Efficacy and Safety of Darolutamide in Patients with Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Stratified by Prostate-specific Antigen Doubling Time: Planned Subgroup Analysis of the Phase 3 ARAMIS Trial"" Eur Urol 2022.', 'Darolutamide in Spanish patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: ARAMIS subgroup analysis.', 'Efficacy and safety of darolutamide in Japanese patients with nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a sub-group analysis of the phase III ARAMIS trial.', 'Darolutamide in Nonmetastatic, Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Clinical Development of Darolutamide: A Novel Androgen Receptor Antagonist for the Treatment of Prostate Cancer.', 'A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis of Novel Androgen Receptor Inhibitors in Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'The positive relationship between androgen receptor splice variant-7 expression and the risk of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A cumulative analysis.']"""

Then, functional effects in response to RBM22 overexpression (proliferation, migration, tumorspheres/colonies formation) were tested in PCa models in vitro (LNCaP, 22Rv1, and PC-3 cell-lines) and in vivo (xenograft). High throughput methods (ie, RNA-seq, nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel) were performed in RBM22 overexpressing cells and xenograft tumors. We found that RBM22 levels were down-regulated (mRNA and protein) in PCa samples, and were inversely associated with key clinical aggressiveness features. Consistently, a gradual reduction of RBM22 from non-tumor to poorly differentiated PCa samples was observed in transgenic models (TRAMP/Pbsn-Myc). Notably, RBM22 overexpression decreased aggressiveness features in vitro, and in vivo. These actions were associated with the splicing dysregulation of numerous genes and to the downregulation of critical upstream regulators of cell-cycle (i.e., CDK1/CCND1/EPAS1). Altogether, our data demonstrate that RBM22 plays a critical pathophysiological role in PCa and invites to suggest that targeting negative regulators of RBM22 expression/activity could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to tackle this disease.""","""['Juan M Jiménez-Vacas', 'Antonio J Montero-Hidalgo', 'Enrique Gómez-Gómez', 'Prudencio Sáez-Martínez', 'Antonio C Fuentes-Fayos', 'Adrià Closa', 'Teresa González-Serrano', 'Ana Martínez-López', 'Rafael Sánchez-Sánchez', 'Pedro P López-Casas', 'André Sarmento-Cabral', 'David Olmos', 'Eduardo Eyras', 'Justo P Castaño', 'Manuel D Gahete', 'Raul M Luque']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Transl Res""","""['Dysregulation of the splicing machinery is directly associated to aggressiveness of prostate cancer.', 'Splicing machinery dysregulation drives glioblastoma development/aggressiveness: oncogenic role of SRSF3.', 'Spliceosome component SF3B1 as novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for prostate cancer.', 'RBM22, a Key Player of Pre-mRNA Splicing and Gene Expression Regulation, Is Altered in Cancer.', 'The role of alternative splicing in cancer: From oncogenesis to drug resistance.']"""

In this study, we aimed to determine the socioeconomic inequalities in the coverage of prostate cancer screening in Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs).  Methods:   This was a retrospective analysis of men's recode data files that were collected by the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in LMICs (Armenia, Colombia, Honduras, Kenya, Namibia, Dominican Republic, and the Philippines). We included surveys that were conducted from 2010 to 2020 and measured the coverage of prostate cancer screening and the study population was men aged 40 years or older. Socioeconomic inequality was measured using the Concertation Index (CIX) and the Slope Index of Inequality (SII).  Results:   Eight surveys from seven countries were included in the study with a total of 47,863 men. The coverage of prostate cancer screening was below 50% in all the countries with lower rates in the rural areas compared to the urban areas. The pooled estimate for the coverage of screening was 10.4% [95% CI, 7.9-12.9%). Inequalities in the coverage of prostate cancer screening between the wealth quintiles were observed in the Democratic Republic, Honduras, and Namibia. Great variation in inequalities in the coverage of prostate cancer screening between rural and urban residents was observed in Colombia and Namibia.  Conclusion:   The coverage of prostate cancer screening was low in LMICs with variations in the coverage by the quintile of wealth (pro-rich) and type of place of residence (pro-urban).  Policy summary:   To achieve the desired impact of prostate cancer screening services in LMICs, it is important that the coverage of screening programs targets men living in rural areas and those in low wealth quintiles.""","""['Derrick Bary Abila', 'Sulaiman B Wasukira', 'Provia Ainembabazi', 'Ruth Ketty Kisuza', 'Elizabeth Kiyingi Nakiyingi', 'Asia Mustafa', 'Grace Kangoma', 'Yusuff Adebayo Adebisi', 'Don Eliseo Lucero-Prisno rd', 'Henry Wabinga', 'Nixon Niyonzima']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Cancer Policy""","""['Delivery channels and socioeconomic inequalities in coverage of reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health interventions: analysis of 36 cross-sectional surveys in low-income and middle-income countries.', 'Educational and wealth inequalities in tobacco use among men and women in 54 low-income and middle-income countries.', 'Socioeconomic inequalities in access to skilled birth attendance among urban and rural women in low-income and middle-income countries.', 'Prostate cancer disparities in South Carolina: early detection, special programs, and descriptive epidemiology.', 'Screening for cancer in low- and middle-income countries.']"""

Methods:   Control group (BPH-1 group), empty carrier group (sh-RNA-BPH-1 group) and Beclin-1 silenced group (sh-Beclin1-BPH-1 group) were set. The Beclin-1 gene silencing efficiency was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Autophagic flux was monitored by GFP-LC3 cleavage assay and cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of LC3, Caspase-3, PARP-1, Bcl-2, and Bax were detected by Western blot.  Results:   The transfection of sh-Beclin-1 obviously down-regulated the expression of Beclin-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Under the conditions of AD and AI, silencing of Beclin-1 restrained the autophagy of BPH-1 cells, as evidenced by a decreased number of autophagosomes and down-regulation of LC3-II protein (p < 0.001). The results of flow cytometry showed that the apoptotic rate of sh-Beclin-1 group was elevated significantly compared to the other two groups (p < 0.01). Western blot results showed that silencing of Beclin-1 promoted 89 kd fragmentation of PARP-1 (p < 0.001) and Caspase-3 activation (p < 0.01). Moreover, silencing of Beclin-1 resulted in declined Bcl-2 and augmented Bax protein expression in BPH-1 cells (p < 0.01), which ultimately led to a decreased Bcl-2/Bax ratio.  Conclusions:   The results indicated that the silencing of Beclin-1 gene hampered autophagy while activating apoptosis in BPH-1 cells.

However, biomarkers guiding treatment selection are lacking. We hypothesized that ADT intensification with ARAT, but not with docetaxel, would be associated with improved outcomes in patients with de novo (dn)-mCSPC harboring SPOP mutations.  Experimental design:   Patient-level data from a deidentified nationwide (U.S.-based) prostate cancer clinico-genomic database between January 2011 and December 2021 were extracted. Eligibility criteria: diagnosis of metastatic disease within 30 days of original prostate cancer diagnosis, genomic profiling of a tissue biopsy collected within 90 days of original diagnosis, and initiation of ARAT or docetaxel within 120 days of initial diagnosis. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (TTCRPC) and overall survival (OS) for patients with and without SPOP mutations undergoing ADT intensification with ARAT or docetaxel.  Results:   In the ARAT cohort, presence of SPOP mutation compared with wild-type was associated with more favorable TTCRPC [not reached (NR) vs. 16.7 months; adjusted HR (aHR), 0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.06-0.63; P = 0.006] and OS (NR vs. 27.2 months; aHR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.79; P = 0.022). In contrast, SPOP mutation status was not associated with TTCRPC or OS in docetaxel-treated cohort.  Conclusions:   In real-world settings, SPOP mutations were associated with improved outcomes to ADT plus ARAT (but not ADT plus docetaxel) in patients with dn-mCSPC.

Understanding its longitudinal expression at emergence of castration resistance and association with tumour genomics are critical to the development of and patient selection for B7-H3 targeted therapies.  Objective:   To characterise B7-H3 expression in same-patient hormone-sensitive (HSPC) and castration-resistant (CRPC) PC biopsies, associating this with PC genomics, and to evaluate the antitumour activity of an anti-B7-H3 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in human CRPC in vitro and in vivo.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing on a cohort of 98 clinically annotated CRPC biopsies, including 72 patients who also had HSPC biopsies for analyses. We analysed two CRPC transcriptome and exome datasets, and PC scRNASeq datasets. PC organoids (patient-derived xenograft [PDX]-derived organoids [PDX-Os]) were derived from PDXs generated from human CRPC biopsies.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated B7-H3 mRNA expression in relation to a panel of 770 immune-related genes, compared B7-H3 protein expression between same-patient HSPC and CRPC biopsies, determined associations with PC genomic alterations, and evaluated the antitumour activity of DS-7300a, a topoisomerase-1 inhibitor payload anti-B7-H3 ADC, in human PC cell lines, organoids (PDX-Os), and xenografts (PDXs) of different histologies, B7-H3 expressions, and genomics.  Results and limitations:   B7-H3 was among the most highly expressed immunomodulatory genes in CRPCs. Most CRPCs (93%) expressed B7-H3, and in patients who developed CRPC, B7-H3 expression was frequently expressed at the time of HSPC diagnosis (97%). Conversion from B7-H3 positive to negative, or vice versa, during progression from HSPC to CRPC was uncommon. CRPC with neuroendocrine features were more likely to be B7-H3 negative (28%) than adenocarcinomas. B7-H3 is overexpressed in tumours with defective DNA repair gene (ATM and BRCA2) alterations and is associated with ERG expression, androgen receptor (AR) expression, and AR activity signature. DS7300a had antitumour activity against B7-H3 expressing human PC models including cell lines, PDX-Os, and PDXs of adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine histology.  Conclusions:   The frequent overexpression of B7-H3 in CRPC compared with normal tissue and other B7 family members implicates it as a highly relevant therapeutic target in these diseases. Mechanisms driving differences in B7-H3 expression across genomic subsets warrant investigation for understanding the role of B7-H3 in cancer growth and for the clinical development of B7-H3 targeted therapies.  Patient summary:   B7-H3, a protein expressed on the surface of the most lethal prostate cancers, in particular those with specific mutations, can be targeted using drugs that bind B7-H3. These findings are relevant for the development of such drugs and for deciding which patients to treat with these new drugs.""","""['Christina Guo', 'Ines Figueiredo', 'Bora Gurel', 'Antje Neeb', 'George Seed', 'Mateus Crespo', 'Suzanne Carreira', 'Jan Rekowski', 'Lorenzo Buroni', 'Jon Welti', 'Denisa Bogdan', 'Lewis Gallagher', 'Adam Sharp', 'Maria D Fenor de la Maza', 'Pasquale Rescigno', 'Daniel Westaby', 'Khobe Chandran', 'Ruth Riisnaes', 'Ana Ferreira', 'Susana Miranda', 'Bianca Calì', 'Andrea Alimonti', 'Silvia Bressan', 'Alana H T Nguyen', 'Michael M Shen', 'Jessica E Hawley', 'Aleksandar Obradovic', 'Charles G Drake', 'Claudia Bertan', 'Chloe Baker', 'Nina Tunariu', 'Wei Yuan', 'Johann S de Bono']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Erratum to ""B7-H3 as a Therapeutic Target in Advanced Prostate Cancer"" Eur Urol 2023;83(3):224-38.', 'B7-H3 and Prostate Cancer: New Therapeutic Dance Partners.', 'Analytical Validation and Clinical Qualification of a New Immunohistochemical Assay for Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 Protein Expression in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Patient-derived Models of Abiraterone- and Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Reveal Sensitivity to Ribosome-directed Therapy.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'Influence of ADT on B7-H3 expression during CRPC progression from hormone-naïve prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, and Beyond.']"""

Magnetic resonance (MR)-guided linear accelerators (MR-Linac) have emphasised this issue by enabling intrafraction imaging. We present and clinically apply a new workflow to counteract systematic intrafraction motion during MR-guided stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).  Materials and methods:   With the sub-fractionation workflow, the daily dose is delivered in multiple sequential parts (sub-fractions), each adapted to the latest anatomy. As each sub-fractionation treatment plan complies with the dose constraints, no online dose accumulation is required. Imaging and treatment planning are executed in parallel with dose delivery to minimise dead time, enabling an efficient workflow. The workflow was implemented on a 1.5 T MR-Linac and applied in 15 prostate cancer (PCa) patients treated with 5 × 7.25 Gy in two sub-fractions of 3.625 Gy (10 × 3.625 Gy in total). Intrafraction clinical target volume (CTV) motion was determined and compared to a workflow with single-plan delivery. Furthermore, required planning target volume (PTV) margins were determined.  Results:   Average on-table time was 42.7 min. Except for two fractions, all fractions were delivered within 60 min. Average intrafraction 3D CTV displacement (±standard deviation) was 1.1 mm (± 0.7) with the sub-fractionation workflow, whereas this was up to 3.5 mm (± 2.4) without sub-fractionation. Calculated PTV margins required with sub-fractionation were 1.0 mm (left-right), 2.4 mm (cranial-caudal), and 2.6 mm (anterior-posterior).  Conclusion:   Feasibility of the sub-fractionation workflow was demonstrated in 15 PCa patients treated with two sub-fractions on a 1.5 T MR-Linac.

This paper describes the cancer burden and status of cancer control measures in these countries.  Methods:   In this comparative analysis, fragile states presenting with a Fragile States Index (FSI) score of 90·0 or more (alert for fragility) for at least 10 years during the 2006-20 period were selected. States with fewer than 10 years of data were selected if they were in alert for fragility during all years. Information on cancer burden, prevalence of cancer risk factors, population-attributable fraction, and on political commitment, health financing, and health system capacity was collected. Cancer incidence and mortality was calculated on the basis of data from population-based cancer registries, estimated with modelling that used mortality-to-incidence ratios and incidence-to-mortality ratios derived from cancer registries in neighbouring countries, or average of rates in selected neighbouring countries. For statistical comparison, fragile states were grouped according to the annual percent change (APC) of the FSI, with group 1 showing an increasing fragility trend (APC 0·2% or higher), group 2 a relatively stable fragility trend (APC between 0·2% and -0·2%), and group 3 a decreasing fragility trend (APC of -0·2% or lower).  Findings:   Overall, the estimated cancer burden in the 31 selected fragile states was lower than worldwide rates, except for cervical and prostate cancer. Cancer cases were attributed to infections (22·40% in group 1, 21·20% in group 2, and 18·80% in group 3) at a higher proportion in fragile states than globally (13·0%). Group 1 and 2 showed a significantly higher exposure to household air pollution (97·70% in group 1 and 94·90% in group 2), whereas current tobacco use in men increased from group 1 to group 3, with lung cancer incidence and mortality being higher in group 3. However, 25 countries had implemented only one or no MPOWER measures for tobacco control. Countries showed an out-of-pocket expenditure of 48·72% in group 1, 42·68% in group 2, and 51·07% in group 3, and only half of the countries had an updated cancer control plan or cancer management guidelines.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) allows shorter treatment courses without impacting acute toxicity. We report 2-year toxicity findings from PACE-B, a randomised trial of conventionally fractionated or moderately hypofractionated radiotherapy versus SBRT.  Methods:   PACE is an open-label, multicohort, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial conducted at 35 hospitals in the UK, Ireland, and Canada. In PACE-B, men aged 18 years and older with a WHO performance status 0-2 and low-risk or intermediate-risk histologically-confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma (Gleason 4 + 3 excluded) were randomly allocated (1:1) by computerised central randomisation with permuted blocks (size four and six), stratified by centre and risk group to control radiotherapy (CRT; 78 Gy in 39 fractions over 7·8 weeks or, following protocol amendment on March 24, 2016, 62 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks) or SBRT (36·25 Gy in five fractions over 1-2 weeks). Androgen deprivation was not permitted. Co-primary outcomes for this toxicity analysis were Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity at 24 months after radiotherapy. Analysis was by treatment received and included all patients with at least one fraction of study treatment assessed for late toxicity. Recruitment is complete. Follow-up for oncological outcomes continues. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01584258.  Findings:   We enrolled and randomly assigned 874 men between Aug 7, 2012, and Jan 4, 2018 (441 to CRT and 433 to SBRT). In this analysis, 430 patients were analysed in the CRT group and 414 in the SBRT group; a total of 844 (97%) of 874 randomly assigned patients. At 24 months, RTOG grade 2 or worse genitourinary toxicity was seen in eight (2%) of 381 participants assigned to CRT and 13 (3%) of 384 participants assigned to SBRT (absolute difference 1·3% [95% CI -1·3 to 4·0]; p=0·39); RTOG grade 2 or worse gastrointestinal toxicity was seen in 11 (3%) of 382 participants in the CRT group versus six (2%) of 384 participants in the SBRT group (absolute difference -1·3% [95% CI -3·9 to 1·1]; p=0·32). No serious adverse events (defined as RTOG grade 4 or worse) or treatment-related deaths were reported within the analysis timeframe.  Interpretation:   In the PACE-B trial, 2-year RTOG toxicity rates were similar for five fraction SBRT and conventional schedules of radiotherapy. Prostate SBRT was found to be safe and associated with low rates of side-effects. Biochemical outcomes are awaited.

We report on a deep learning architecture, comprising a U-Net and a variational autoencoder (VAE) for automatic contouring of the prostate gland incorporating interobserver variation for radiotherapy treatment planning. The U-Net/VAE generates an ensemble set of segmentations for each image CT slice. A novel outlier mitigation (OM) technique was implemented to enhance the model segmentation accuracy.  Methods:   The primary source dataset (source_prim) consisted of 19 200 CT slices (from 300 patient planning CT image datasets) with manually contoured prostate glands. A smaller secondary source dataset (source_sec) comprised 640 CT slices (from 10 patient CT datasets), where prostate glands were segmented by 5 independent physicians on each dataset to account for interobserver variability. Data augmentation via random rotation (<5 degrees), cropping, and horizontal flipping was applied to each dataset to increase sample size by a factor of 100. A probabilistic hierarchical U-Net with VAE was implemented and pretrained using the augmented source_prim dataset for 30 epochs. Model parameters of the U-Net/VAE were fine-tuned using the augmented source_sec dataset for 100 epochs. After the first round of training, outlier contours in the training dataset were automatically detected and replaced by the most accurate contours (based on Dice similarity coefficient, DSC) generated by the model. The U-Net/OM-VAE was retrained using the revised training dataset. Metrics for comparison included DSC, Hausdorff distance (HD, mm), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) coefficient, and center-of-mass (COM) distance (mm).  Results:   Results for U-Net/OM-VAE with outliers replaced in the training dataset versus U-Net/VAE without OM were as follows: DSC = 0.82 ± 0.01 versus 0.80 ± 0.02 (p = 0.019), HD = 9.18 ± 1.22 versus 10.18 ± 1.35 mm (p = 0.043), NCC = 0.59 ± 0.07 versus 0.62 ± 0.06, and COM = 3.36 ± 0.81 versus 4.77 ± 0.96 mm over the average of 15 contours. For the average of 15 highest accuracy contours, values were as follows: DSC = 0.90 ± 0.02 versus 0.85 ± 0.02, HD = 5.47 ± 0.02 versus 7.54 ± 1.36 mm, and COM = 1.03 ± 0.58 versus 1.46 ± 0.68 mm (p < 0.03 for all metrics). Results for the U-Net/OM-VAE with outliers removed were as follows: DSC = 0.78 ± 0.01, HD = 10.65 ± 1.95 mm, NCC = 0.46 ± 0.10, COM = 4.17 ± 0.79 mm for the average of 15 contours, and DSC = 0.88 ± 0.02, HD = 7.00 ± 1.17 mm, COM = 1.58 ± 0.63 mm for the average of 15 highest accuracy contours. All metrics for U-Net/VAE trained on the source_prim and source_sec datasets via pretraining, followed by fine-tuning, show statistically significant improvement over that trained on the source_sec dataset only. Finally, all metrics for U-Net/VAE with or without OM showed statistically significant improvement over those for the standard U-Net.  Conclusions:   A VAE combined with a hierarchical U-Net and an OM strategy (U-Net/OM-VAE) demonstrates promise toward capturing interobserver variability and produces accurate prostate auto-contours for radiotherapy planning. The availability of multiple contours for each CT slice enables clinicians to determine trade-offs in selecting the ""best fitting"" contour on each CT slice. Mitigation of outlier contours in the training dataset improves prediction accuracy, but one must be wary of reduction in variability in the training dataset.""","""['Xin Li', 'Hassan Bagher-Ebadian', 'Stephen Gardner', 'Joshua Kim', 'Mohamed Elshaikh', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Dongxiao Zhu', 'Indrin J Chetty']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Evaluating the clinical acceptability of deep learning contours of prostate and organs-at-risk in an automated prostate treatment planning process.', 'ARPM-net: A novel CNN-based adversarial method with Markov random field enhancement for prostate and organs at risk segmentation in pelvic CT images.', 'Abdomen CT multi-organ segmentation using token-based MLP-Mixer.', 'Deep learning for segmentation in radiation therapy planning: a review.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.']"""

We examined the prevalence of depression and anxiety and its association with HRQOL in men about to commence treatment for CaP and the differences between treatment groups, radical prostatectomy (RP) and radiation therapy (RT).  Method:   One hundred and seven participants from a longitudinal prospective observational study assessing depression, anxiety and HRQOL in men with localised CaP (DAHCaP), were used in this cross-sectional analysis. Data were collected shortly before participants were scheduled to receive their treatment. The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer (MAX-PC), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment in Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and (EORTC QLQ-PR25) were used in this analysis.  Results:   Symptoms of depression pre-treatment were noted in 39.3%, state anxiety 28%, trait anxiety 31.4% and prostate cancer anxiety in 12.1% of participants.

However, there is a lack of definite studies to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the loss of SPINK1 expression in most PCa cells except 22Rv1 cells, which are derived from a human prostatic carcinoma xenograft, CWR22R. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of SPINK1 protein positive/negative expression and its biological roles in PCa cell lines. SPINK1 mRNA was highly expressed in 22Rv1 cells compared with LNCaP, C4-2B, DU145, and PC-3 cells, and the protein was only detected in 22Rv1 cells. Among these cell lines, the wild-type SPINK1 coding sequence was only found in 22Rv1 cells, and two mutation sites, the c.194G>A missense mutation and the c.210T>C synonymous mutation, were found in other cell lines. Our further research showed that the mutations were associated with a reduction in SPINK1 mRNA and protein levels. Functional experiments indicated that SPINK1 promoted PC-3 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while knockdown of SPINK1 attenuated 22Rv1 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The wild-type SPINK1 gene can promote the malignant behaviors of cells more than the mutated ones. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that SPINK1 decreased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and increased the percentage of S phase cells. We demonstrated that the c.194G>A and c.210T>C mutations in the SPINK1 gene decreased the mRNA and protein levels.

Currently, limited knowledge is available on subtype-specific metabolic features and their implications for treatment. We therefore investigated the metabolic determinants of the two major subtypes of castration-resistant prostate cancer [androgen receptor-expressing prostate cancer (ARPC) and aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC)]. Transcriptomic analyses revealed enrichment of gene sets involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in ARPC tumor samples compared with AVPC. Unbiased screening of metabolic signaling pathways in patient-derived xenograft models by proteomic analyses further supported an enrichment of OXPHOS in ARPC compared with AVPC, and a skewing toward glycolysis by AVPC. In vitro, ARPC C4-2B cells depended on aerobic respiration, while AVPC PC3 cells relied more heavily on glycolysis, as further confirmed by pharmacologic interference using IACS-10759, a clinical-grade inhibitor of OXPHOS. In vivo studies confirmed IACS-10759's inhibitory effects in subcutaneous and bone-localized C4-2B tumors, and no effect in subcutaneous PC3 tumors. Unexpectedly, IACS-10759 inhibited PC3 tumor growth in bone, indicating microenvironment-induced metabolic reprogramming. These results suggest that castration-resistant ARPC and AVPC exhibit different metabolic dependencies, which can further undergo metabolic reprogramming in bone.  Implications:   These vulnerabilities may be exploited with mechanistically novel treatments, such as those targeting OXPHOS alone or possibly in combination with existing therapies.

Further evaluation was conducted in clinical samples for in vitro and in vivo experiments, to prove the potential possibility that ZFP36 dysregulation participated in the malignant phenotype of PCa, to determine its potential mechanism for tumor regulation, and to provide a new theoretical basis for gene therapy of PCa.  Methods:   First, the expression of ZFP36 in prostate tissue and PCa tissue was explored, and the relationship between ZFP36 and clinical features of PCa patients was illustrated. Subsequently, the impact of ZFP36 on the biology of PCa cells and relevant downstream pathways of ZFP36's biological impact on PCa were elucidated. Finally, whether oxidative stress mediated the regulation of ZFP36 in PCa was verified by the determination of oxidative stress-related indicators and bioinformatics analysis.  Results:   The downregulation of ZFP36 in PCa tissue had a positive correlation with high Gleason scores, advanced pathological stage, and biochemical recurrence. ZFP36 was identified as an independent prognostic factor for PCa patients' BCR-free survival (P = 0.022) by survival analysis. Following a subsequent experiment of function gain and loss, ZFP36 inhibited the proliferation, invasion, and migration in DU145 and 22RV1 cells and inhibits tumor growth in the mouse model. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing screened out CDK6 as the downstream target gene of ZFP36. Western blot/Q-PCR demonstrated that overexpression of ZFP36 could reduce the expression of CDK6 at both cellular and animal levels, and the dual-luciferase experiment and RIP experiment proved that CDK6 was the downstream target of ZFP36, indicating that CDK6 was a downstream target of ZFP36, which mediated tumor cell growth by blocking cell cycle at the G1 stage.

Most previous research has focused on material financial burden rather than financial worry. This study investigated employment predictors of financial worry and examined outcomes potentially affected by financial worry.  Methods:   Data from the 2018 National Health Interview Study was used and limited to people diagnosed with cancer and having complete data on relevant variables (n = 2049). Preliminary analyses indicated three dimensions of financial worry: healthcare; lifestyle; and basic needs. Outcomes included cost-related nonadherence, and presence of depressive symptoms and anxiety. Multivariable regressions examined the association of financial worry with cost-related nonadherence and mental health and employment characteristics (paid hourly; sick leave; employer size) with financial worry while controlling for demographics.  Results:   Mean age was 68.10 years (range: 20-85), and most had skin (33.6%), prostate (12.5%) or breast (21.4%) cancer. Hourly pay predicted more financial worry about affording healthcare (p &lt; 0.001), basic needs (p &lt; 0.001) and lifestyle (p &lt; 0.001). Having paid sick leave predicted less worry about basic needs (p = 0.003). Worry about affording healthcare predicted more cost-related nonadherence (p &lt; 0.001) even when controlling for other variables associated with financial hardship. Worry about lifestyle (p = 0.193) and basic needs (p = 0.688) were not associated with cost-related nonadherence. Worry about lifestyle (p &lt; 0.001) predicted depression. Worry about affording healthcare (p = 0.042) and lifestyle (p &lt; 0.001) predicted anxiety.  Conclusions:   Research is needed to determine the value of financial worry screening, particularly about affording healthcare, as well as material financial hardship.

We conducted all analyses through software R 3.6.3 and its suitable packages. Compared to normal samples, we observed that the LUZP2 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in LGG, PRAD, LUSC and downregulated in KIRC and other eleven cancer species patients. In terms of overall survival, low-expression of LUZP2 was significantly associated with poor prognosis in lower grade glioma (LGG), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). For progression-free survival, we observed that downregulation of LUZP2 was significantly related to LGG, KIRC, LUSC, and PRAD. Our results observed negative correlations of the stemness of LGG and PRAD with the mRNA expression of LUZP2, whose downregulation was closely associated with poor prognosis. The mutation frequencies of LGG, PRAD, KIRC, and LUSC were 0.4%, 0.4%, 0.3%, and 2.1%, respectively. We detected that the LUZP2 level was negatively associated with TILs in most cancers, including LGG, LUSC, PRAD, and KIRC, while the LUZP2 methylation showed the opposite results.

A common intratumoral evolutionary pathway, probably initiated as adaptation to hypoxia, leads to the ""Warburg phenotype"" which maintains high glycolytic rates and acid production, even in normoxic conditions. Since individual cancer cells are the unit of Darwinian selection, intraspecific competition dominates intratumoral evolution. Thus, elements of the Warburg phenotype become key ""strategies"" in competition with cancer cell populations that retain the metabolism of the parental normal cells. Here we model the complex interactions of cell populations with Warburg and parental phenotypes as they compete for access to vasculature, while subject to direct interference by Warburg-related acidosis. In this competitive environment, vasculature delivers nutrients, removes acid and necrotic detritus, and responds to signaling molecules (VEGF and TNF-α). The model is built in a nested fashion and growth parameters are derived from monolayer, spheroid, and xenograft experiments on prostate cancer. The resulting model of in vivo tumor growth reaches a steady state, displaying linear growth and coexistence of both glycolytic and parental phenotypes consistent with experimental observations. The model predicts that increasing tumor pH sufficiently early can arrest the development of the glycolytic phenotype, while decreasing tumor pH accelerates this evolution and increases VEGF production. The model's predicted dual effects of VEGF blockers in decreasing tumor growth while increasing the glycolytic fraction of tumor cells has potential implications for optimizing angiogenic inhibitors.""","""['Frederika Rentzeperis', 'Naomi Miller', 'Arig Ibrahim-Hashim', 'Robert J Gillies', 'Robert A Gatenby', 'Dorothy Wallace']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Math Biosci""","""['The glycolytic phenotype in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion: insights through mathematical models.', 'The Warburg effect: essential part of metabolic reprogramming and central contributor to cancer progression.', 'Adaptation to Stochastic Temporal Variations in Intratumoral Blood Flow: The Warburg Effect as a Bet Hedging Strategy.', 'VEGF-targeted therapy stably modulates the glycolytic phenotype of tumor cells.', 'Fatal Alliance of Hypoxia-/HIF-1α-Driven Microenvironmental Traits Promoting Cancer Progression.']"""

To supplement these 31, we verified transcriptional targets for 56 additional risk alleles using linear proximity and linkage disequilibrium analysis in localized prostate tumors. Some individual risk alleles influenced multiple target genes; others specifically influenced only distal genes while leaving proximal ones unaffected. Several risk alleles exhibited widespread germline-somatic interactions in transcriptional regulation, having different effects in tumors with loss of PTEN or RB1 relative to those without. These data clarify functional prostate cancer risk alleles in large linkage blocks and outline a strategy to model multidimensional transcriptional regulation.

Addition of essential amino acids or expression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) partially restored growth following loss of GCN2, suggesting that GCN2 targeting of SLC transporters is required for amino acid homeostasis needed to sustain tumor growth.

Methods:   The authors retrospectively reviewed their prospectively collected cryosurgery database between January 2002 and September 2019 for men who were treated with WGC of the prostate at a tertiary referral center. Primary outcome includes biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS). Secondary outcomes include failure-free survival (FFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS) and adverse events.  Results:   A total of 260 men were included in the study. Men having had prior treatment for Pca were excluded. Median follow-up was 107 months (interquartile range [IQR], 68.3-132.5 months). BRFS, FFS, and MFS at 10 years were 84%, 66%, and 96%, respectively. High risk D'Amico classification was associated with a lower BRFS and FFS on multivariable analysis. No patient had any Pca-related death during follow-up. American Urological Association symptoms score and bother index were unchanged following cryoablation. Median International Index of Erectile Function score precryoablation and post-cryoablation was 7 (IQR, 3-11) and 1 (IQR, 1-5), respectively. Stress urinary incontinence, defined as requiring any protective pads only occurred in five patients (2%). No patient developed a fistula. Grade > 2 Clavien-Dindo adverse events occurred in six (2.3%) patients.  Conclusion:   WGC of the prostate can achieve excellent oncological and functional outcomes in men with localized Pca at the 10-year mark. Primary WGC may be a good option for men who desire to preserve urinary continence and have an excellent oncologic outcome.  Lay summary:   Primary whole gland cryoablation is an alternative treatment option to radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy for men with organ-confined prostate cancer. Patients had excellent cancer outcomes 1 years after whole gland cryoablation, and patients with PSA nadir 0.1 ng/ml or lower after treatment were less likely to have disease recurrence.""","""['Wei Phin Tan', 'Srinath Kotamarti', 'Emily Chen', 'Rachael Mahle', 'Rohith Arcot', 'Andrew Chang', 'Alexandria Ayala', 'Zoe Michael', 'Denis Seguier', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['WGC in patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'Primary Whole-gland Cryoablation for Prostate Cancer: Biochemical Failure and Clinical Recurrence at 5.6 Years of Follow-up.', 'Oncological and Functional Outcomes for Men Undergoing Salvage Whole-gland Cryoablation for Radiation-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Whole and hemi-gland cryoablation for primary localized prostate cancer: Short and medium-term oncological and functional outcomes.', 'Oncological and Functional Outcomes of Patients Undergoing Individualized Partial Gland Cryoablation of the Prostate: A Single-Institution Experience.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

As with other members of the NR family, transcriptional activity of the AR is regulated by interactions with coregulatory proteins, which either enhance (coactivators) or repress (corepressors) its transcriptional activity. AR associated coregulators are functionally diverse, but a large fraction are epigenetic histone and chromatin modifiers. Epigenetic coregulators are recruited to gene regulatory regions as part of multi-protein complexes, often acting in a dynamic and inter-dependent manner to remodel chromatin, thereby allowing or inhibiting the access of AR-associated transcriptional machinery to target genes; functional consequences being regulation of transcriptional output. Epigenetic modifiers, including those that function as AR coregulators, are frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in prostate cancer and are implicated in disease progression. Some of these modifiers are being investigated as therapeutic targets in several cancer types and could potentially be used to modulate aberrant AR activity in prostate cancer. In this chapter we will summarise the functional role of epigenetic coregulators in AR signalling, their dysregulation during prostate cancer progression and the current status of drugs targeting these enzymes.""","""['Rayzel C Fernandes', 'Damien A Leach', 'Charlotte L Bevan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Adv Exp Med Biol""","""['Identification and characterization of androgen receptor associated coregulators in prostate cancer cells.', 'MiR137 is an androgen regulated repressor of an extended network of transcriptional coregulators.', 'Mechanism of androgen receptor corepression by CKβBP2/CRIF1, a multifunctional transcription factor coregulator expressed in prostate cancer.', 'The corepressors silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor and nuclear receptor corepressor are involved in agonist- and antagonist-regulated transcription by androgen receptor.', 'Androgen receptor coregulators and their involvement in the development and progression of prostate cancer.']"""

Indeed, the functions of AR and ERα are central to both prostate and mammary gland biology. The genomic interactions of these NRs become highly distorted in part by changing how they functionally interact with a cohort of non-steroidal Type II NRs, which are by contrast relatively understudied compared to their steroidal cousins. For example, the AR cistrome overlaps with cistromes of different Type II NRs, which suggests a high potential for integrated NR functions to tailor transcriptional signals.

On Jurkat cell-derived EVs, β1 and α4 integrin subunits colocalized predominantly with CD47 and CD81 but not with CD63 and CD9, conserving the known lateral interactions between these proteins in the plasma membrane. Although PC3 cell-derived EVs lacked detectable α4 integrin, specific association of CD81 with β1 and CD47 was preserved.

The effect of iodinated hydrogel spacer material on the accuracy of proton dosimetry has not been fully studied yet. We presented a systematic study to determine the effect of iodination on proton dosimetry accuracy during proton therapy (PT).  Methods:   PT plans were designed for 20 prostate cancer patients with rectal hydrogel spacer. Three variations of hydrogel density were considered. First, as the ground truth, the true elemental composition of hydrogel true material (TM), verified by our measurement of spacer stopping power ratio, was used for plan optimization and Monte Carlo dose calculation. The dose distribution was recalculated with (1) no material (NM) override based on the CT intensity of the iodinated spacer, and (2) the water material (WM) override, where spacer material was replaced by water. The plans were compared with the ground truth using the metrics of gamma index (GI) and dosimetric indices.  Results:   The iodination of hydrogel spacer affected the proton dose distribution with the NM scenario showing the most deviation from the ground truth. The iodination of spacer resulted in a notable increase in CT intensity and led to the treatment planning systems mistreating the iodinated spacer as a high-density material. Among the structures adjacent to the target, neurovascular bundles showed the largest dose difference, up to 350 cGy or about 5% of the prescribed dose with NM. Compared to the WM scenario, dose distribution similarity and GI passing ratios were lower in the NM scenario.  Conclusion:   The inaccurate CT intensity-based material for iodinated spacer resulted in errors in PT dose calculation. We found that the error was negligible if the iodinated spacer was replaced with water. Water density can be used as a clinically accessible and convenient alternative material override to true spacer material.""","""['Hamed Hooshangnejad', 'Dong Han', 'Ziwei Feng', 'Liang Dong', 'Edward Sun', 'Kaifang Du', 'Kai Ding']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Comparison of rectal dose reduction by a hydrogel spacer among 3D conformal radiotherapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy, helical tomotherapy, CyberKnife and proton therapy.', 'Dosimetric feasibility of moderately hypofractionated/dose escalated radiation therapy for localised prostate cancer with intensity-modulated proton beam therapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-IMPT) and impact of hydrogel prostate-rectum spacer.', 'Dosimetric comparison of stopping power calibration with dual-energy CT and single-energy CT in proton therapy treatment planning.', 'Characterization of an Iodinated Rectal Spacer for Prostate Photon and Proton Radiation Therapy.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'DAART: a deep learning platform for deeply accelerated adaptive radiation therapy for lung cancer.', 'deepPERFECT: Novel Deep Learning CT Synthesis Method for Expeditious Pancreatic Cancer Radiotherapy.']"""

However, even in magnetic resonance-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT), consistent delineation of the urethra is challenging, particularly in online adaptive radiotherapy. This paper presented a fully automatic MRgRT-based prostatic urethra segmentation framework.  Methods:   Twenty-eight prostate cancer patients were included in this study. In-house 3D half fourier single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) and turbo spin echo (TSE) sequences were used to image the Foley-free urethra on a 0.35 T MRgRT system. The segmentation pipeline uses 3D nnU-Net as the base and innovatively combines ground truth and its corresponding radial distance (RD) map during training supervision. Additionally, we evaluate the benefit of incorporating a convolutional long short term memory (LSTM-Conv) layer and spatial recurrent convolution layer (RCL) into nnU-Net. A novel slice-by-slice simple exponential smoothing (SEPS) method specifically for tubular structures was used to post-process the segmentation results.  Results:   The experimental results show that nnU-Net trained using a combination of Dice, cross-entropy and RD achieved a Dice score of 77.1 ± 2.3% in the testing dataset. With SEPS, Hausdorff distance (HD) and 95% HD were reduced to 2.95 ± 0.17 mm and 1.84 ± 0.11 mm, respectively. LSTM-Conv and RCL layers only minimally improved the segmentation precision.  Conclusion:   We present the first Foley-free MRgRT-based automated urethra segmentation study. Our method is built on a data-driven neural network with novel cost functions and a post-processing step designed for tubular structures. The performance is consistent with the need for online and offline urethra dose reduction in prostate radiotherapy.""","""['Di Xu', 'Ting Martin Ma', 'Ricky Savjani', 'Jonathan Pham', 'Minsong Cao', 'Yingli Yang', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Fabien Scalzo', 'Ke Sheng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Development of a 3D CNN-based AI Model for Automated Segmentation of the Prostatic Urethra.', 'Evaluation of T2-Weighted MRI for Visualization and Sparing of Urethra with MR-Guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT) On-Board MRI.', 'Machine Segmentation of Pelvic Anatomy in MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) for Prostate Cancer Brachytherapy.', 'Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.']"""

Methods:   The RNA-seq data of PCa patients was downloaded from several online databases. PCa patients were stratified into two Classes by unsupervised clustering. A novel signature was constructed by Cox and the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression.

Results:   Twelve prognostic pyroptosis-related genes were identified and used to classify PCa patients into two prognostic Classes. We constructed a signature that identified PCa patients with different risks of recurrence and the risk score was proven to be an independent predictor of the recurrence free survival (RFS). Patients in the high-risk group had a significantly lower RFS (P<0.001). The expression of various immune cells differed between the two Classes.

A lutetium-labeled PSMA targeted ligand, 177Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL is a novel radiopharmaceutical, which has been developed for the treatment of prostate cancer. While the GUL domain of 177Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL binds to the antigen, the beta-emitting radioisotope, 177Lu-labeled DOTA, interacts with prostate cancer cells. However, the in vivo pharmacokinetics of intact 177Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL has never been characterized. This study aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of the radiopharmaceutical in rats by using its stable isotope-labeled analog, 175Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL. A sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of 175Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL was developed and validated. Following intravenous injection, the plasma concentration-time profiles of 175Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL showed a multi-exponential decline with the average elimination half-life of 0.30 to 0.33 h. Systemic exposure increased with the dose and renal excretion is the major elimination route. Tissue distribution of 175Lu-DOTA-PSMA-GUL was most substantial in kidneys, followed by the prostate.

The druggable potential of importins still remains unclear, largely because of the lack of potent inhibitors. Herein, the anti-castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) screening of a Euphorbiaceae diterpenoid library followed by target fishing led to the identification of a highly potent importin-β1 inhibitor, daphnane diterpenoid DD1. DD1 selectively inhibited the growth and survival of CRPC cells at subnanomolar concentrations and completely blocked tumor growth in preclinical models at an extremely low dosage. Mechanistic studies revealed that targeting of importin-β1 by DD1 significantly reduced the nuclear accumulation of key CRPC drivers, shutting down their downstream oncogenic signaling. Disruption of the predicted binding sites of DD1 on importin-β1 abolished this anti-CRPC effect.

Barriers to widespread implementation result in underutilization of germline testing. Somatic testing alone risks missing pathogenic germline variants (PGVs). We sought to determine whether the addition of germline testing to tumor-only sequencing improves detection of PGVs in men with advanced PCa. Secondarily, we sought to define the added value of combining somatic and germline testing to optimize detection of clinically actionable alterations.  Patients and methods:   We analyzed results of independent germline testing and tumor-only sequencing from 100 men with advanced PCa from a prospective clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03328091). The primary outcome was the proportion of PGVs not reported with tumor-only sequencing. The secondary outcome was the association of locus-specific loss of heterozygosity for PGVs in homologous recombination genes with clinical-genomic features.  Results:   In the 100 men who underwent germline testing and tumor-only sequencing, 24 PGVs were identified, 17 of which were clinically actionable, in 23 patients. Tumor-only sequencing failed to report four (17%) of the PGVs. One additional PGV (4.2%) had variant allele frequency on tumor-sequencing below the threshold for follow-up germline testing. When integrating tumor-only sequencing with germling testing results, 33% of patients harbored clinically actionable alterations. Rates of locus-specific loss of heterozygosity were higher for BRCA2 PGVs in castration-resistant PCa than PGVs in other homologous recombination genes in hormone-sensitive PCa (P = .029).  Conclusion:   Tumor-only sequencing failed to report more than 20% of PGVs in men with advanced PCa. These findings strongly support guideline recommendations for universal germline and somatic testing in this population.

Current methods for 3D reconstruction from freehand ultrasound scans require external tracking devices to provide spatial information of an ultrasound transducer. This paper presents a novel deep learning approach for sensorless ultrasound volume reconstruction, which efficiently exploits content correspondence between ultrasound frames to reconstruct 3D volumes without external tracking. The underlying deep learning model, deep contextual-contrastive network (DC 2-Net), utilizes self-attention to focus on the speckle-rich areas to estimate spatial movement and then minimizes a margin ranking loss for contrastive feature learning. A case-wise correlation loss over the entire input video helps further smooth the estimated trajectory. We train and validate DC 2-Net on two independent datasets, one containing 619 transrectal scans and the other having 100 transperineal scans. Our proposed approach attained superior performance compared with other methods, with a drift rate of 9.64 % and a prostate Dice of 0.89. The promising results demonstrate the capability of deep neural networks for universal ultrasound volume reconstruction from freehand 2D ultrasound scans without tracking information.""","""['Hengtao Guo', 'Hanqing Chao', 'Sheng Xu', 'Bradford J Wood', 'Jing Wang', 'Pingkun Yan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""IEEE Trans Biomed Eng""","""['3D freehand ultrasound without external tracking using deep learning.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Deep Attentive Features for Prostate Segmentation in 3D Transrectal Ultrasound.', 'Freehand 3-D Ultrasound Imaging: A Systematic Review.', '3D elastography using freehand ultrasound.']"""

How much an assessment of inherited polygenic risk for prostate cancer adds to lifetime risk stratification beyond family history is unknown.  Experimental design:   We followed 10,120 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study with existing genotype data for risk of prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific death. We assessed to what extent family history of prostate or breast cancer, combined with a validated polygenic risk score (PRS) including 269 prostate cancer risk variants, identifies men at risk of prostate cancer and prostate cancer death across the age span.  Results:   During 20 years of follow-up, 1,915 prostate cancer and 166 fatal prostate cancer events were observed. Men in the top PRS quartile with a family history of prostate or breast cancer had the highest rate of both prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific death. Compared with men at lowest genetic risk (bottom PRS quartile and no family history), the HR was 6.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.57-8.66] for prostate cancer and 4.84 (95% CI, 2.59-9.03) for prostate cancer death. Men in the two upper PRS quartiles (50%-100%) or with a family history of prostate or breast cancer (61.8% of the population) accounted for 97.5% of prostate cancer deaths by age 75 years.  Conclusions:   Our study shows that prostate cancer risk stratification on the basis of family history and inherited polygenic risk can identify men at highest risk of dying from prostate cancer before age 75 years.""","""['Anna Plym', 'Yiwen Zhang', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Yon Ho Jee', 'Fredrik Wiklund', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Peter Kraft', 'Edward Giovannucci', 'Kathryn L Penney#', 'Lorelei A Mucci#']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Development and validation of a simple prostate cancer risk prediction model based on age, family history, and polygenic risk.', 'A Healthy Lifestyle in Men at Increased Genetic Risk for Prostate Cancer.', 'Breast and prostate cancer risk: The interplay of polygenic risk, rare pathogenic germline variants, and family history.', 'Utility of polygenic risk scores in UK cancer screening: a modelling analysis.', 'How Well do Polygenic Risk Scores Identify Men at High Risk for Prostate Cancer?

Therefore, it is required to develop an effective signature for predicting the relapse risk of PRAD. To identify a circadian rhythm- (CR-) related predictive signature, we analyzed RNA-seq data of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) from the TCGA and GEO cohort. Seven circadian rhythm- (CR-) related genes (FBXL22, MTA1, TP53, RORC, DRD4, PPARGC1A, ZFHX3) were eventually identified to develop a CR-related signature. AUCs for 3-year overall survival were 0.852, 0.856 and 0.944 in the training set, validation set and an external independent test set (GSE70768), respectively. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that the high-risk group has a reduced relapse-free survival (RFS) than the low-risk group in the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively (P < 0.05). We constructed a prognostic nomogram combining the CR-related signature with T staging to precisely estimate relapse risk of PRAD patients. Finally, we observed that the CR-related gene signature was associated with tumor mutation burden, multiple immune checkpoint molecules and microsatellite instability, and thus could predict response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in PRAD.

Objective:   To develop a simulation model with a 30-year follow-up for men with PC managed with AS.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this cohort study, a state transition model was created using data from Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) on 23 655 men diagnosed with PC and managed with deferred treatment to estimate treatment trajectories. A simulation was performed with 100 000 men in each combination of age at diagnosis, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and PC risk with a follow-up of 30 years.  Main outcomes and measures:   Death from PC and death from other causes were estimated, and the proportion of time without active PC treatment was assessed until date of death or age 85 years.  Results:   This study included 23 655 men from PCBaSe with a median age at diagnosis of 69 years (IQR, 64-74 years). Of these, 16 177 men underwent active surveillance for PC and 7478 underwent watchful waiting. The proportion of men who were diagnosed at age 55 years and died of PC before age 85 years was 9% for very low-risk PC, 13% for low-risk PC, and 15% for intermediate-risk PC. Among men with a Charlson Comorbidity Index of 0 who were diagnosed at age 70 years, the corresponding percentages were 3%, 6%, and 7%, respectively. The mean proportion of remaining life-years without active PC treatment for men diagnosed at age 55 years was 12 of 25 years (48%) for very low-risk PC, 9 of 25 years (36%) for low-risk PC, and 7 of 25 (29%) for intermediate-risk PC. For men aged 70 years, the corresponding numbers were 10 of 13 years (77%), 9 of 13 years (66%), and 8 of 13 years (60%), respectively. Men with intermediate-risk PC who were younger than 60 years at diagnosis had a high risk of PC death (12%-15%) and fewer remaining life-years without active PC treatment (29%-33%). In contrast, men with low-risk PC who were older than 65 years at diagnosis had a lower risk of PC death (3%-5%) and more remaining life-years without active PC treatment (62%-77%).  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this Swedish cohort study suggest that active surveillance may be a safe strategy for disease management among men with PC who were older than 65 years at diagnosis.""","""['Eugenio Ventimiglia', 'Anna Bill-Axelson', 'Ola Bratt', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Pär Stattin', 'Hans Garmo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Exploring the Long-term Outcomes of Active Surveillance Among Men With Prostate Cancer-Best for Whom?', 'Population based study of use and determinants of active surveillance and watchful waiting for low and intermediate risk prostate cancer.', 'Outcome following active surveillance of men with screen-detected prostate cancer.

We studied the modulation of 15 circulating steroids by castration and their association with dihydrotestosterone and testosterone levels.  Materials methods:   A total of 116 serum samples were collected from 99 prostate cancer patients and categorized as eugonadal, castration-sensitive prostate cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer, or castration-resistant prostate cancer under abiraterone acetate. Serum levels of 15 steroids were measured using mass spectrometry and compared between groups using analysis of variance. Intrapatient association of steroid levels and the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone were assessed using Pearson correlation and linear regression.  Results:   Testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate, androsterone, androstenediol, estrone, estrone-sulfate, estradiol, and androsterone/3α-diol-3/3α-diol-17-glucuronide levels were significantly decreased in castration-sensitive prostate cancer (castrated) compared to eugonadal patients. Testosterone levels were strongly associated with multiple steroids under eugonadal conditions, whereas they were weakly affected by precursor steroids in castrated patients. By contrast, dihydrotestosterone levels under androgen deprivation therapy were associated with testosterone and the backdoor pathway metabolite androsterone. In castration-resistant prostate cancer patients, levels of androstenedione were significantly associated with testosterone level, while testosterone was the only steroid associated with dihydrotestosterone levels.  Conclusions:   Androgen deprivation therapy significantly reduces the levels of 13 circulating steroids. Upon androgen deprivation therapy initiation, the backdoor pathway metabolite androsterone are strongly associated with dihydrotestosterone levels. Under castration-resistant prostate cancer conditions, androstenedione was significantly associated with testosterone levels, suggesting the presence of tumor-related circulating androgens in these patients. These results provide further rationale to intensify treatments with androgen receptor axis signaling pathway inhibitors in patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Mélanie Rouleau', 'Bertrand Neveu', 'Patrick Caron', 'Fannie Morin', 'Paul Toren', 'Louis Lacombe', 'Véronique Turcotte', 'Éric Lévesque', 'Chantal Guillemette', 'Frédéric Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Extragonadal Steroids Contribute Significantly to Androgen Receptor Activity and Development of Castration Resistance in Recurrent Prostate Cancer after Primary Therapy.', 'Preliminary observations on steroid metabolism in isolated epithelum of guinea pig seminal vesicle.', 'The 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione pathway and C11-oxy C21 backdoor pathway are active in benign prostatic hyperplasia yielding 11keto-testosterone and 11keto-progesterone.', 'Qualitative and quantitative hormonal regulation in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate: oral androgen biosynthesis inhibitor for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Serum Androgen Metabolites Correlate with Clinical Variables in African and European American Men with Localized, Therapy Naïve Prostate Cancer.', 'Preclinical models of prostate cancer - modelling androgen dependency and castration resistance in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo.', 'Editorial: Complexity of tumor microenvironment: A major culprit in cancer development.']"""

Methods:   In 2016, the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer collected survey responses from cancer survivors about their experiences with follow-up cancer care. We included respondents from this survey if they were diagnosed with non-metastatic breast, hematologic, colon, melanoma, and prostate cancer. Our primary outcome was cancer survivors' self-reported overall experience with follow-up cancer care. We used multivariable logistic regression to examine the influence of individual and structural factors on cancer survivors' experiences with follow-up cancer care.  Results:   Of the 8402 cancer survivors included in our study, 81.8% (n = 6,875) reported a positive experience with their follow-up cancer care. The individual factors associated with positive overall experiences were more commonly those associated with self-perceptions of respondents' personal health and well-being rather than baseline sociodemographic factors, such as sex, income, or education. For example, respondents were more likely to report a positive experience if they perceived their quality of life as good (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.5, p < 0.01) or reported not having an unmet practical concern (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.6, p < 0.01). The structural factors most strongly associated with positive overall experiences included respondents perceiving their oncology specialist was in charge of their follow-up cancer care (OR 5.2, 95% CI 3.6-7.5, p < 0.01) and reporting the coordination of their follow-up cancer care among healthcare providers was good or very good (OR 8.4, 95% CI 6.7-10.6, p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   While real-world experiences with follow-up cancer care in Canada are reported to be positive by most cancer survivors included in this study, we found differences exist based on individual and structural factors.

However, detection is hindered by insufficient tumor tissue and low sensitivity of cell-free DNA for detecting copy number loss.  Objective:   To evaluate the BRCA2 loss detection using single-cell, shallow whole-genome sequencing (sWGS) of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in patients with mCRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed CTC samples collected concurrently with tumor biopsies intended for clinical sequencing in patients with progressing mCRPC.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Differences in proportions were evaluated using the chi-square test. Correlations between assays were analyzed in linear regression models. Associations between alterations and genomic instability were assessed on the single-cell level using mixed-effect negative binomial models.  Results and limitations:   We identified 138 patients with concurrent CTC and biopsy samples. CTC sWGS generated copy number profiles in a similar proportion of patients to biopsy samples (83% vs 78%, p = 0.23), but was more effective than bone biopsies (79% vs 50%; p = 0.009). CTC sWGS detected BRCA2 loss in more patients than tissue at the ≥1 (42% vs 16%; p < 0.001) and ≥2 (27% vs 16%; p = 0.028) CTC thresholds. The overall prevalence of BRCA2 loss was not increased in CTCs using sample-level composite z scores (p = 0.4), but was significantly increased compared with a lower-than-expected prevalence in bone samples (21% vs 3%, p = 0.014). Positive/negative predictive values for CTC BRCA2 loss were 89%/96% using the ≥1 CTC threshold and 67%/92% using the composite z score. CTC BRCA2 loss was associated with higher genomic instability in univariate (1.4-fold large-scale transition difference, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2-1.6; p < 0.001) and multivariable analysis (1.4-fold difference, 95% CI: 1.2-1.6; p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Copy number profiles can reliably be generated using CTC sWGS, which detected a majority of tissue-confirmed BRCA2 loss and ""CTC-only"" losses. BRCA2 losses were supported by increases in genomic instability.  Patient summary:   Current testing strategies have limitations in their ability to detect BRCA2 loss, a relatively common alteration in prostate cancer that is used to identify patients who may benefit from targeted therapy. In this paper, we evaluated whether we could detect BRCA2 loss in individual tumor cells isolated from patient blood samples and found this method to be suitable for further analysis.""","""['Ethan S Barnett', 'Nikolaus Schultz', 'Konrad H Stopsack', 'Ernest T Lam', 'Andrea Arfe', 'Jerry Lee', 'Jimmy L Zhao', 'Joseph D Schonhoft', 'Emily A Carbone', 'Niamh M Keegan', 'Andreas Wibmer', 'Yipeng Wang', 'David B Solit', 'Wassim Abida', 'Richard Wenstrup', 'Howard I Scher']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Discordant and heterogeneous clinically relevant genomic alterations in circulating tumor cells vs plasma DNA from men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Chromosomal Instability Estimation Based on Next Generation Sequencing and Single Cell Genome Wide Copy Number Variation Analysis.', 'Single-Cell Circulating Tumor Cell Analysis Reveals Genomic Instability as a Distinctive Feature of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.', 'Circulating Tumor Cell Genomic Evolution and Hormone Therapy Outcomes in Men with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Genomic Testing in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A Pragmatic Guide for Clinicians.', 'Recent Advances in Blood-Based Liquid Biopsy Approaches in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, there has been limited studies exploring the utility PSMA-PET as primary imaging assessing for index lesions prior to biopsy. The primary objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of 18-fluorine PSMA (18F DCFPyL PSMA) PET scans to multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) to detect primary prostate cancer at prostate biopsy.  Methods and analysis:   The PEDAL trial is a multicentre, prospective, single-arm, paired comparison, non-randomised phase III trial in subjects considered for diagnostic prostate biopsy. Subjects who are eligible for a diagnostic mpMRI prostate will undergo additional same-day 18 F DCFPyl PSMA PET/CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Software coregistration of the mpMRI and PSMA-PET/CT images will be performed. The reporting of the mpMRI prostate, PSMA-PET/CT and PSMA PET/MRI coregistration will be performed blinded. The diagnostic accuracy of PSMA PET/CT alone, and in combination with mpMRI, to detect prostate cancer will be assessed. Histopathology at prostate biopsy will be used as the reference standard. Sample size calculations estimate that 240 subjects will need to be recruited to demonstrate 20% superiority of PSMA-PET/CT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the combination of mpMRI prostate and PSMA PET/CT compared with targeted and systematic prostate biopsy will be evaluated. It is hypothesised that PSMA PET/CT combined with mpMRI prostate will have improved diagnostic accuracy compared with mpMRI prostate alone for detection of prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men, resulting in a significant impact on patient management.

However, the effect of wildfire-related PM2.5 exposure on cancer mortality risk is unknown. This study evaluates the association between wildfire-related PM2.5 and site-specific cancer mortality in Brazil, from 2010 to 2016.  Methods and findings:   Nationwide cancer death records were collected during 2010-2016 from the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Death records were linked with municipal-level wildfire- and non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentrations, at a resolution of 2.0° latitude by 2.5° longitude. We applied a variant difference-in-differences approach with quasi-Poisson regression, adjusting for seasonal temperature and gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the exposure for specific cancer sites were estimated. Attributable fractions and cancer deaths were also calculated. In total, 1,332,526 adult cancer deaths (age ≥ 20 years), from 5,565 Brazilian municipalities, covering 136 million adults were included. The mean annual wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 2.38 μg/m3, and the annual non-wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration was 8.20 μg/m3. The RR for mortality from all cancers was 1.02 (95% CI 1.01-1.03, p < 0.001) per 1-μg/m3 increase of wildfire-related PM2.5 concentration, which was higher than the RR per 1-μg/m3 increase of non-wildfire-related PM2.5 (1.01 [95% CI 1.00-1.01], p = 0.007, with p for difference = 0.003). Wildfire-related PM2.5 was associated with mortality from cancers of the nasopharynx (1.10 [95% CI 1.04-1.16], p = 0.002), esophagus (1.05 [95% CI 1.01-1.08], p = 0.012), stomach (1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.017), colon/rectum (1.08 [95% CI 1.05-1.11], p < 0.001), larynx (1.06 [95% CI 1.02-1.11], p = 0.003), skin (1.06 [95% CI 1.00-1.12], p = 0.003), breast (1.04 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.007), prostate (1.03 [95% CI 1.01-1.06], p = 0.019), and testis (1.10 [95% CI 1.03-1.17], p = 0.002). For all cancers combined, the attributable deaths were 37 per 100,000 population and ranged from 18/100,000 in the Northeast Region of Brazil to 71/100,000 in the Central-West Region. Study limitations included a potential lack of assessment of the joint effects of gaseous pollutants, an inability to capture the migration of residents, and an inability to adjust for some potential confounders.

Lower SES was an independent risk factor for worse disease-specific survival (DSS) for patients with MBD originating from lung, prostate, breast and colon. Lack of insurance was an independent risk factor for worse DSS for MBD patients with primary tumors in lung and breast.  Conclusions:   MBD patients from the five most common primary sites demonstrated SES and insurance-related disparities in disease-specific survival.

C/EBPβ dimerization regulates binding to DNA at the canonical TTGCGCAA motif and subsequent transcriptional activity, suggesting that disruption of dimerization represents a powerful approach to inhibit this previously ""undruggable"" oncogenic target. Here we describe the mechanism of action and antitumor activity of ST101, a novel and selective peptide antagonist of C/EBPβ that is currently in clinical evaluation in patients with advanced solid tumors. ST101 binds the leucine zipper domain of C/EBPβ, preventing its dimerization and enhancing ubiquitin-proteasome dependent C/EBPβ degradation. ST101 exposure attenuates transcription of C/EBPβ target genes, including a significant decrease in expression of survival, transcription factors, and cell-cycle-related proteins. The result of ST101 exposure is potent, tumor-specific in vitro cytotoxic activity in cancer cell lines including glioblastoma, breast, melanoma, prostate, and lung cancer, whereas normal human immune and epithelial cells are not impacted. Further, in mouse xenograft models ST101 exposure results in potent tumor growth inhibition or regression, both as a single agent and in combination studies. These data provide the First Disclosure of ST101, and support continued clinical development of ST101 as a novel strategy for targeting C/EBPβ-dependent cancers.""","""['Emad Darvishi', 'Lila Ghamsari', 'Siok F Leong', 'Ricardo Ramirez', 'Mark Koester', 'Erin Gallagher', 'Miao Yu', 'Jody M Mason', 'Gene Merutka', 'Barry J Kappel', 'Jim A Rotolo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Targeting Transcription Factors ATF5, CEBPB and CEBPD with Cell-Penetrating Peptides to Treat Brain and Other Cancers.', 'RSK-mediated phosphorylation in the C/EBP{beta} leucine zipper regulates DNA binding, dimerization, and growth arrest activity.', 'Pancreatic beta-cell-specific repression of insulin gene transcription by CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta.

We hypothesized that a shorter time to sBCR will be associated with worse cancer control outcomes.  Methods:   The RTOG 9601 study included 760 patients with tumor stage pT2/T3, pN0, who had either persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) postradical prostatectomy or developed subsequent biochemical recurrence with PSA levels between 0.2 and 4.0 ng/ml. All patients received sRT (with or without 2 years of Bicalutamide) from 1998 to 2015. For our study, we focused on 421 patients who had sBCR after sRT-which was defined as a PSA increase of at least 0.3 ng/ml over the first nadir. Patients were divided into two categories: early sBCR (n = 210) and late sBCR (n = 211) using median time to sBCR (3.51 years). All patients who experienced sBCR received salvage hormonal therapy. Competing-risk analysis was used to examine the impact of early versus late sBCR on prostate cancer specific mortality (CSM), after accounting for available covariates.  Results:   The majority of patients were age 60 years or older (75.8%), had pT3 disease (74.8%), and Gleason score 7 (75.2%). Overall, 13.8% had persistent PSA initially after surgery. At 10 years, starting at the time of sBCR, CSM rate was 31.3% in the early sBCR group versus 20.0% in the late sBCR group. In competing-risk analysis, time to sBCR was an independent predictor of CSM, where patients with early sBCR had 1.7-fold higher CSM risk (p = 0.026) than their counterparts with late sBCR.  Conclusions:   Time to sBCR after sRT (with or without concomitant Bicalutamide) is a significant predictor of CSM following initial radical prostatectomy.

Herein, we aim to verify performance on new Alinity i assays by evaluating sera collected from healthy children as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) EP-28A3C guidelines.  Methods:   Precision, linearity, and method comparison experiments were completed for 17 specialized Alinity immunoassays, including cancer antigens, autoimmune peptides, and hormones. Sera collected from healthy children and adolescents (birth-18 years, n=100) were evaluated. CLSI-based verification was completed using previously established CALIPER RIs for ARCHITECT assays as the reference.  Results:   Of 17 specialized immunoassays assays, only anti-cyclic citrullinated peptides (anti-CCP) did not meet acceptable verification criterion (i.e., ≥90% of results within ARCHITECT reference CI). Anti-thyroglobulin, anti-thyroid peroxidase, and carcinoembryonic antigen did not require age-specific consideration beyond one year of age, with 63, 91, and 80% of samples equalling the limit of detection, respectively. Estimates were separated by sex for relevant assays (e.g., sex hormone binding globulin, total and free prostate specific antigen).

Our data-driven analysis of transcriptomes identifies several distinct intratumoral cell populations, characterized by their unique gene expression profiles. Certain cell populations present before treatment exhibit gene expression profiles that match those of resistant tumor cell clusters, present after treatment. We confirm that these clusters are resistant by the localization of active androgen receptors to the nuclei in cancer cells post-treatment.

Since clinically actionable germline variants may be reflected in tumor profiling, it is critical to identify which variants have a higher risk of being germline in origin to better counsel patients and prioritize genetic testing.  Objective:   To determine when variants found on tumor-only sequencing of prostate cancers should prompt confirmatory germline testing.  Design, setting, and participants:   Men with prostate cancer who underwent both tumor and germline sequencing at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from January 1, 2015 to January 31, 2020 were evaluated.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Tumor and germline profiles were analyzed for pathogenic and likely pathogenic (""pathogenic"") variants in 60 moderate- or high-penetrance genes associated with cancer predisposition. The germline probability (germline/germline + somatic) of a variant was calculated for each gene. Clinical and pathologic factors were analyzed as potential modifiers of germline probability.  Results and limitations:   Of the 1883 patients identified, 1084 (58%) had a somatic or germline pathogenic variant in one of 60 cancer susceptibility genes, and of them, 240 (22%) had at least one germline variant. Overall, the most frequent variants were in TP53, PTEN, APC, BRCA2, RB1, ATM, and CHEK2. Variants in TP53, PTEN, or RB1 were identified in 746 (40%) patients and were exclusively somatic. Variants with the highest germline probabilities were in PALB2 (69%), MITF (62%), HOXB13 (60%), CHEK2 (55%), BRCA1 (55%), and BRCA2 (47%), and the overall germline probability of a variant in any DNA damage repair gene was 40%. Limitations were that most of the men included in the cohort had metastatic disease, and different thresholds for pathogenicity exist for somatic and germline variants.  Conclusions:   Of patients with pathogenic variants found on prostate tumor sequencing, 22% had clinically actionable germline variants, for which the germline probabilities varied widely by gene. Our results provide an evidenced-based clinical framework to prioritize referral to genetic counseling following tumor-only sequencing.  Patient summary:   Patients with advanced prostate cancer are recommended to have germline genetic testing. Genetic sequencing of a patient's prostate tumor may also identify certain gene variants that are inherited. We found that patients who had variants in certain genes, such as ones that function in DNA damage repair, identified in their prostate tumor sequencing, had a high risk for having an inherited cancer syndrome.""","""['Hong Truong', 'Kelsey Breen', 'Subhiksha Nandakumar', 'Daniel D Sjoberg', 'Yelena Kemel', 'Nikita Mehta', 'Andrew T Lenis', 'Peter A Reisz', 'Jessica Carruthers', 'Nicole Benfante', 'Vijai Joseph', 'Aliya Khurram', 'Anuradha Gopalan', 'Samson W Fine', 'Victor E Reuter', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Ozge Birsoy', 'Ying Liu', 'Michael Walsh', 'Alicia Latham', 'Diana Mandelker', 'Zsofia K Stadler', 'Eugene Pietzak', 'Behfar Ehdaie', 'Karim A Touijer', 'Vincent P Laudone', 'Susan F Slovin', 'Karen A Autio', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Dana E Rathkopf', 'James A Eastham', 'Yu Chen', 'Michael J Morris', 'Kenneth Offit', 'David B Solit', 'Howard I Scher', 'Wassim Abida', 'Mark E Robson', 'Maria I Carlo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Detection of Pathogenic Germline Variants Among Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer Undergoing Tumor Genomic Profiling for Precision Medicine.', 'Comprehensive assessment of germline pathogenic variant detection in tumor-only sequencing.', 'Germline genetic variants in men with prostate cancer and one or more additional cancers.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Moderate penetrance genes complicate genetic testing for breast cancer diagnosis: ATM, CHEK2, BARD1 and RAD51D.', 'Frequency of Germline and Somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations in Prostate Cancer: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.']"""

We sought to investigate the effect of trial participation on biochemical recurrence (BCR) in localised, D'Amico intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT).  Materials and methods:   We relied on a study population treated with EBRT between January 2001 and January 2021 at a single tertiary care centre, stratified according to trial enrolment. Separate Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression models tested BCR-free survival at 60 months within intermediate- and high-risk EBRT patients, after adjustment for covariables. Additionally, the analyses were refitted after inverse probability treatment weighting was performed separately for both risk subgroups.  Results:   Of 932 eligible patients, 635 (68%) and 297 (32%) had intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, respectively. Overall, 53% of patients were trial participants. BCR rates were 11 versus 5% (P = 0.27) and 12 versus 14% (P = 0.08) in trial participants versus non-participants for intermediate- and high-risk subgroups, respectively. Differences in patient and clinical characteristics were recorded. Trial participation status failed to reach predictor status in multivariable Cox regression models for BCR in both intermediate-risk (hazard ratio 1.34; 95% confidence interval 0.71-2.49; P = 0.4) and high-risk patients (hazard ratio 1.03; 95% confidence interval 0.45-2.34; P = 0.9).

Methods:   Patients with rising PSA post-RP+SRT underwent 68Ga-HBED-iPSMA PET/CT on a single-arm, prospective imaging trial (NCT03204123). Scans were centrally reviewed with pattern-of-failure analysis by involved site. Positive scans were classified using 3 failure categories: pelvic nodal, extra-pelvic nodal or distant non-nodal. Associations with failure categories were analyzed using cumulative incidence and generalized logits regression.  Results:   We included 133 men who received SRT a median of 20 months post-RP; 56% received SRT to the prostatic fossa alone, while 44% received pelvic SRT. PSMA PET/CT was performed a median of 48 months post-SRT. Overall, 31% of PSMA PET/CT scans were negative, 2% equivocal and 67% had at least 1 positive site. Scan detection was significantly associated with PSA level prior to PSMA PET/CT. Analysis of 89 positive scans demonstrated pelvic nodal (53%) was the most common relapse and fossa relapse was low (9%). Overall, positive scans were pelvic (n = 35, 26%), extra-pelvic nodal (n = 26, 20%) or distant non-nodal failure (n = 28, 21%), and 70% of positive scans were oligorecurrent. We observed similar cumulative incidence for all failure categories and relatively few clinicodemographic associations. Men treated with pelvic SRT had reduced odds of pelvic failure versus exclusive fossa treatment.  Conclusion:   Pelvic, extra-pelvic nodal, and distant non-nodal failures occur with similar incidence post-SRT. Regional nodal relapse is relatively common, especially with fossa-only SRT.

Materials and methods:   We use a uniquely designed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisition protocol that provides gold-standard measurements of σADC to train a deep learning model on two separate cohorts: 16 patients with prostate cancer and 28 patients with mesothelioma. Our network was trained with a novel cost function, which incorporates a perception metric and a b-value regularisation term, on ADC maps calculated by combinations of 2 or 3 b-values (e.g. 50/600/900, 50/900, 50/600, 600/900 s/mm2). We compare the accuracy of the deep-learning based approach for estimation of σADC with gold-standard measurements.  Results:   The model accurately predicted the σADC for every b-value combination in both cohorts. Mean values of σADC within areas of active disease deviated from those measured by the gold-standard by 4.3% (range, 2.87-6.13%) for the prostate and 3.7% (range, 3.06-4.54%) for the mesothelioma cohort. We also showed that the model can easily be adapted for a different DWI protocol and field-of-view with only a few images (as little as a single patient) using transfer learning.

Using a difference-in-differences design, we show that adopting a robot drives prostate cancer patients to the hospital. To test whether this result reflects market expansion or business stealing, we also consider market-level effects of adoption and find effects that are significant but smaller, suggesting that adoption expands the market while also reallocating some patients across hospitals. Marginal patients are relatively young and healthy, inconsistent with the concern that adoption broadens the criteria for intervention to patients who would gain little from it.

The primary objective of this study was to develop and pilot test a set of clinical decision support (CDS) alerts informed by social psychology to address overuse in three areas related to ambulatory care of older adults.  Methods:   We developed three electronic health record (EHR) CDS alerts to address overuse and pilot tested them from January 17, 2019 to July 17, 2019. We enrolled 14 primary care physicians from three practices within a large health system who cared for adults aged 65 years and older. Three measures of overuse applied to patients meeting the following criteria: ordering of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) for prostate cancer screening in adult men aged 76 years and older, ordering of urinalysis or urine cultures (UA or UC) for non-specific reasons to identify bacteriuria in women aged 65 years and older, and overtreatment of diabetes with insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications in adults aged at 75 years and older (DM). Clinicians received CDS alerts when criteria for any of the three overuse measures were met. We then surveyed clinicians to evaluate their experience with the CDS alerts.  Results:   The number of clinical encounters that triggered CDS alerts was 19 for PSA, 48 for UA/UC and 128 for DM. For PSA encounters, 4 (21%) orders were not performed after the alert. In the UA/UC encounters 29 (60%) orders were not performed after the alert. For the DM encounters, 21 (34%) had diabetes therapy reduced following the alert. Survey respondents indicated that the alerts were clinically accurate and sometimes led them to change their clinical action.

Patients and methods:   Patients with PSMA-PET-positive PCa local recurrences treated with single-fraction SBRT between 2016 and 2020 were included. Identification for subsequent recurrences or metastatic spread based on increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were evaluated using PSMA-PET imaging.  Results:   A total of 64 patients were identified. Patients received various treatments before SBRT (31 patients with radical prostatectomy [RP], 18 external beam radiotherapy [EBRT] with RP, five EBRT, and the remaining 10 other combinations). The median follow-up was 21.6 months. The median PSA level before SBRT was 1.47 ng/mL. All patients received a single-fraction treatment with a median prescription dose and isodose line of 21 Gy and 65%, respectively. At the time of SBRT, six patients (9%) received an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). PSA levels decreased after SBRT (P = 0.03) and three local recurrences were detected during the follow-up. The progression-free survival after 1-, 2-, and 3-years was 85.3%, 65.9%, and 51.2%, respectively. Six patients (9%) started ADT after SBRT due to disease progression.

Conclusion:   While the available data for SBRT in the PCa local recurrence setting describe outcomes for fractionated irradiations, the findings of this first analysis of single-fraction, PSMA-PET- and mpMRI-guided focal SBRT are encouraging. Such treatment appears to be a safe, efficient, and time-saving therapy even in intensively pretreated patients.

PET/CT imaging with Ga-68 PSMA has played an important role in prostate cancer imaging in recent years. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the relationship and prognostic significance between SUVmax values obtained with Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT and LDH and ALP levels in prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 61 prostate cancer patients who had Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT imaging and who did not have a prostatectomy between 2019 and 2020. PSA, ALP and LDH levels were measured in all patients before or after imaging within a maximum of 28 days.  Results:   The median age of the patients included in this study was 73 (range: 57-89) and all 61 patients were prostatic adenocarcinoma. 50 (82%) of the patients had distant metastasis in Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT.

Materials and methods:   The clinical pathological findings in the surgical specimen and total PSA were used to define the three CAPRA-S risk groups. One month after surgery and at each follow up total PSA and the ALC were determined, until biochemical failure (BF) or the end of the study period. A cut off value of <1,000 lymphocytes/mm3 was used to define lymphocytopenia (LCP). Each CAPRA-S group was sub-divided based on the presence or absence of LCP. Kaplan-Meier biochemical failure free survival (BFFS) curves and restricted mean biochemical failure free survival times were calculated for each group.  Results:   404 patients participated of whom 103 (25.5%) underwent BF. 270 men were CAPRA-S low risk (LR), 89 intermediate risk (IR) and 45 high risk (HR), of whom LCP was found in 22 (8%) of low risk, 24 (27%) of intermediate risk and 17 (38%) of high risk men. LCP was significantly associated with a higher PSA, higher Gleason and CAPRA-S scores and BF. HRs were 1.76 for IR, 2.49 for HR and 1.29 for LCP. Five-year BFFS for men without LCP, LR 93.5%, IR 61% and HR 36%, for those with LCP, LR 55%, IR 25% and HR 6%. All patients with LCP and IR or HR scores relapsed within 6 years. 10 year BFFS for men without LCP were 71% LR, 43% IR and 23% HR, LR with LCP 16%. Men with BF had increasing LCP approximately 18 months before BF.  Conclusions:   The incorporation of the ALC taken one month after surgery with the CAPRA-S improves risk stratification; decreases in the ALC suggest that BF is occuring.

Results:   The hybrid imaging modalities [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET-CT and PET-MRI were positive in more patients than MRI alone. In particular, PET-CT detected lesions suggestive of PCa relapse in 34/53 (64.2%), PET-MRI in 36/53 (67.9%) and MRI in 23/53 patients (43.4%). While no significant differences in lesion detection rate were observed between PET-CT and PET-MRI, the latter was particularly efficient in detection of local recurrences in the prostate bed mainly due to the contribution of the MRI part of the modality. Association analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the probability of a positive scan with increasing PSA levels for all imaging modalities. Accordingly, there was no significant association between scan positivity rate and Gleason score for any imaging modality.

We aimed to explore perceived influences on treatment decision-making from the patient and partner's perspectives.  Methods:   Patients (and partners) who met AS criteria and had chosen their treatment were recruited. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted via telephone to explore experiences of diagnosis, impact on patient lifestyle, experiences with physicians, treatment preferences/choice, treatment information understanding and needs, and overall decision-making process. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis.  Results:   Twenty-four male patients (18 chose AS) and 12 female partners participated. Five themes relating to social-ecological influences on treatment choice were identified: (1) partner support and direct influence on patient treatment choice, (2) patient and partner vicarious experiences may influence treatment decisions, (3) the influence of the patient's life circumstances, (4) disclosing to wider social networks: friends, family, and co-workers, and (5) the importance of a good relationship and experience with physicians. Additionally, two themes were identified relating to information patients and partners received about the treatment options during their decision-making process.  Conclusions:   A range of individual and social influences on treatment decision-making were reported. Physicians providing treatment recommendations should consider and discuss the patient and partner's existing beliefs and treatment preferences and encourage shared decision-making.

Carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) is a novel radiotherapy technique and the immunomodulatory effect of CIRT provides the possibility of overcoming radioresistance and improving efficacy. The aim of this study was to assess the immune response evoked by CIRT in localized prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Thirty-two patients were treated by CIRT combined with or without hormone therapy and peripheral blood samples were collected before and after CIRT. Investigation of peripheral immune cell frequency, proliferation, and cytokine expression was conducted by flow cytometry, real-time quantitative PCR and ELISA.  Results:   There were no significant differences in the frequencies of CD3 + , CD4 + , CD8 + T cells and NK cells after CIRT. CD4/CD8 ratio increased whereas B cells decreased. All lymphocyte subsets except regulatory T cells (Tregs) displayed increased proliferation and T cells exhibited increased functionality after CIRT, characterized by modestly increased cytokine secretion of TNF. Moreover, higher frequencies of Tregs were shown. Neither monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) nor early MDSCs changed after CIRT. TGF-β1 gene expression decreased while IL-6 showed a non-significant trend towards a decrease. Both IL-10 gene expression and plasma TGF-β1 level were unchanged.  Conclusion:   CIRT demonstrates the potential to elicit immune activation in localized prostate cancer patients, based on sparing lymphocytes, increased lymphocyte proliferation, enhanced T-cell functionality, together with limited induction of immunosuppressive cells and reduced expression of immunosuppressive cytokines.""","""['Wei Hu', 'Yulei Pei', 'Renli Ning', 'Ping Li', 'Zhenshan Zhang', 'Zhengshan Hong', 'Cihang Bao', 'Xiaomao Guo', 'Yun Sun', 'Qing Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Differential Immune Modulation With Carbon-Ion Versus Photon Therapy.', 'Effect of blood transfusion during radiotherapy on the immune function of patients with cancer of the uterine cervix: role of interleukin-10.', 'Carbon Ion Radiotherapy Evokes a Metabolic Reprogramming and Individualized Response in Prostate Cancer.', 'Value of carbon-ion radiotherapy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer.', 'Clinical Indications for Carbon Ion Radiotherapy.', 'CAR T cell-based immunotherapy and radiation therapy: potential, promises and risks.']"""

Cathepsin K (CTSK) is a cysteine protease that usually has a strong activity of degrading extracellular matrix and is related to osteoclast-mediated bone destruction. However, the mechanism of CTSK-regulation in CRPC is still unclear to us. The current study aimed to analyze the expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in patient samples (from localized PC and CRPC). Interestingly, we found that CTSK to be significantly up-regulated in CRPC. Through further signal pathway enrichment analysis, we found that the IL-17 signaling pathway to be highly correlated with CTSK. The oncogenic functions of CTSK and IL-17 in CRPC were proven by a series of in vivo and in vitro experiments. Possible downstream molecules of CTSK were investigated, which could serve as control elements to regulate the expression of EMT, thereby facilitating the metastasis and excessive proliferation of PC cells. Expression of CTSK was related to high concentration of M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) M2 in CRPC. A CTSK-mediated feedback circuit between TAMs and CRPC tissues was indicated in the process of transfer, proving the possibility of CTSK could be use as an available therapeutic target for CRPC.""","""['Ning Wu#', 'YouZhi Wang#', 'KeKe Wang#', 'BoQiang Zhong#', 'YiHao Liao', 'JiaMing Liang', 'Ning Jiang']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Gut microbiota-stimulated cathepsin K secretion mediates TLR4-dependent M2 macrophage polarization and promotes tumor metastasis in colorectal cancer.', 'Effect of dietary omega-3 fatty acids on castrate-resistant prostate cancer and tumor-associated macrophages.', 'Prostate tumor RON receptor signaling mediates macrophage recruitment to drive androgen deprivation therapy resistance through Gas6-mediated Axl and RON signaling.', 'Cathepsin K: A Versatile Potential Biomarker and Therapeutic Target for Various Cancers.', 'Androgen receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms driving prostate cancer progression: Opportunities for therapeutic targeting from multiple angles.', 'The immunoregulatory protein CD200 as a potentially lucrative yet elusive target for cancer therapy.', 'Signatures and prognostic values of related immune targets in tongue cancer.', 'The uPA/uPAR System Orchestrates the Inflammatory Response, Vascular Homeostasis, and Immune System in Fibrosis Progression.', 'Cathepsin K in Pathological Conditions and New Therapeutic and Diagnostic Perspectives.']"""

Methods: In total, 301 consecutive mCRPC patients were included in this analysis. Prognostic factors included clinical parameters, routine laboratory parameters, and findings on posttreatment scintigraphy. Scintigraphic tumor uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T was compared with salivary gland uptake and classified as high or low. The longest extent of skeletal metastatic disease was measured, and its changes during therapy were used to define scintigraphic progression, response, and stable disease. A PSA response of at least 50%, PSA PFS, and OS were calculated. Results: In total, 1,138 cycles (median, 3 cycles per patient) of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T using a standard activity of 7.4 GBq were applied intravenously every 4-10 wk (median, 6 wk). Overall, 34% (95% CI, 28%-38%) of patients showed a PSA response of at least 50%, and the median PSA PFS and OS of the total patient cohort were 16.0 wk (95% CI, 12.1-19.9) and 13.8 mo (95% CI, 12.4-15.5), respectively. Patients with high scintigraphic tumor uptake showed a higher PSA response rate of at least 50% (45.7% vs. 10.4%; P < 0.0001) and a significantly reduced risk of PSA progression (median event time, 24.9 vs. 9.0 wk; hazard ratio, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.5; P < 0.0001). In our data, risk of death was not significantly different between patients with high scintigraphic uptake and those with low scintigraphic uptake (median, 14.4 vs. 12.4 mo; hazard ratio, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.6-1.3; P = 0.6). In a multivariable analysis, the following pretherapeutic prognostic factors for OS were identified: alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and PSA levels; prior chemotherapy; and the presence of visceral metastases.

Pathologic findings were grouped into 6 TNM regions, and lesion-based disease extent was classified as no disease (n = 1, 4%), unifocal (n = 2, 7%), oligometastatic (n = 9, 32%), multifocal (n = 3, 11%), or disseminated (n = 13, 47%). For each region, the SUVmax of the lesion with the highest uptake was measured and the visual PSMA expression score was evaluated on a per-patient basis using PROMISE criteria. The association between PSMA expression and clinical and histopathologic markers was tested using the Student t test. Five patients underwent PSMA RLT with intratherapeutic dosimetry. Response was assessed using RECIST 1.1, and adverse events were graded according to version 5.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Results: Compared with CT, PSMA PET/CT demonstrated additional metastatic lesions in 11 of 28 (39%) patients, leading to upstaging of TNM and lesion-based disease extent in 3 (11%) and 6 (21%) patients, respectively. PSMA PET/CT detected CT-occult local tumor, regional lymph nodes, nonregional lymph nodes, and bone metastases in 1 (4%), 4 (14%), 2 (7%), and 4 (14%) patients, respectively; no additional lesions were detected in the other predefined regions.

The advantages of radionuclide therapy for bone metastases include the simultaneous treatment of multiple lesions at the same time. The activity prescription is based on the patient's body weight, disregarding the absorbed dose limit of 2 Gy in the organ at risk: bone marrow. This study focuses on Internal Dosimetry for 223RaCl2 therapy aiming to apply biokinetic models described in the literature to estimate absorbed doses in the organs of interests, especially for the bone marrow. For this purpose, the present paper compares and validates the GATE Monte Carlo simulation with the Radioactive Decay Module (RDM) and calculates a set of S-values for Radium-223 radionuclide using male and female XCAT computational models. Moreover, a comparison of S-values for Radium-223 for three male computational models with different anatomies is also evaluated, Male (standard), Pat1 (lower body weight) and Pat2 (highest body weight). A comprehensive set of S-values was calculated for the Male model, 30 source-regions and 47 target-regions, and for Female model, 30 source-regions and 42 target-regions for Radium-223 and its decay scheme: Radon-219, Polonium-215, Lead-211, Bismuth- 211, Polonium-211 and Thallium-207.

However, whether exosomal circRNA Scm-like with four malignant brain tumor domains 2 (circ-SFMBT2) was involved in the chemoresistance of prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear. The docetaxel (DTX) resistance of PCa cells was analyzed by Cell Counting Kit 8 assay. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure circSFMBT2, microRNA (miR)-136-5p and tribbles homolog 1 (TRIB1) expression. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion were analyzed by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry, wound-healing assay and transwell assay. RNA interaction was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Protein expression was measured by western blot analysis. Exosomes-extracted from cells were identified by transmission electron microscope, nanoparticles tracking analysis and western blot. Xenograft mice models were constructed to analyze the effect of exosomal circSFMBT2 on the DTX sensitivity of PCa tumors in vivo. CircSFMBT2 was upregulated in DTX-resistant PCa cells, and its knockdown enhanced the DTX sensitivity of DTX-resistant PCa cells by suppressing cell proliferation, migration, invasion and enhancing apoptosis. CircSFMBT2 severed as miR-136-5p sponge to positively regulate TRIB1. The regulation of circSFMBT2 knockdown on the DTX sensitivity of DTX-resistant PCa cells could be reversed by miR-136-5p inhibitor or TRIB1 overexpression. Exosomal circSFMBT2 from DTX-resistant PCa could increase the DTX resistance of normal PCa cells. In addition, exosomal circSFMBT2 also enhanced the DTX resistance of PCa tumors in vivo, and it was highly expressed in the serum of DTX-resistance PCa patients. Exosomal circSFMBT2 enhanced the DTX resistance of PCa by miR-136-5p/TRIB1 axis, indicating that circSFMBT2 might be a potential target for the treatment of PCa chemoresistance.""","""['Xiaoliang Tan', 'Xiaosen Song', 'Bo Fan', 'Ming Li', 'Aili Zhang', 'Long Pei']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Anticancer Drugs""","""['Exosomal Circ-XIAP Promotes Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Regulating miR-1182/TPD52 Axis.', 'Long noncoding RNA MALAT1 enhances the docetaxel resistance of prostate cancer cells via miR-145-5p-mediated regulation of AKAP12.', 'Exosomal circRNA HIPK3 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and metastasis in prostate cancer by regulating miR-212/BMI-1 pathway.', 'Circ_0003998 Regulates the Progression and Docetaxel Sensitivity of DTX-Resistant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by the miR-136-5p/CORO1C Axis.', 'Competing tissue-specific functions for the Tribbles-1 plasma lipid associated locus.', 'Recent advances of exosomal circRNAs in cancer and their potential clinical applications.', 'Exosomes: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Implications in Cancer.', 'Unraveling the significance of exosomal circRNAs in cancer therapeutic resistance.']"""

E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase neural precursor cell expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) imparts an regulatory role in various malignancies. This study focused on the modulatory mechanism of NEDD4L in proliferation of prostate cancer cells (PCCs) via regulating histone demethylase plant homeodomain finger protein 8 (PHF8/KDM7B) through the ubiquitin-proteasome system.  Methods:   The expression levels of NEDD4L, PHF8, H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) and activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) in PC tissues and cell lines were detected via real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. After transfection of pcDNA3.1-NEDD4L, pcDNA3.1-PHF8, and pcDNA3.1-ATF2 into PCCs, cell proliferation was assessed via the cell counting kit-8 and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays. Interaction between NEDD4L and PHF8 was identified via the protein immunoprecipitation. The ubiquitination level of PHF8 was determined via the ubiquitination detection. The enrichments of H3K9me2 and PHF8 in the ATF2 promotor region were detected via the chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay.  Results:   PHF8 and ATF2 were highly expressed while NEDD4L was poorly expressed in PC tissues and cells. NEDD4L overexpression reduced proliferation of PCCs. NEDD4Linduced degradation of PHF8 via ubiquitination. PHF8 limited the enrichment of H3K9me2 in the ATF2 promotor region and enhanced ATF2 transcription.

We aimed to evaluate whether DDR-markers in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) may have predictive potential for outcome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receiving [177Lu]Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT).  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled 20 men with advanced mCRPC scheduled for PSMA-targeted RLT. Prior to the first cycle of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT, all patients underwent [18F]F-PSMA-1007 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for assessment of tumor PSMA expression (assessing maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of all tumor lesions). Blood samples were collected prior to, + 1 h after, and + 24 h after administration of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA, and DDR-markers γ-H2AX and 53BP1 were determined in PBLs through immunocytofluorescence. We then tested the predictive performance of DDR-markers relative to clinical and PET-based parameters for progressive disease (PSA-PD) after 2 cycles. In addition, the predictive value for progression-free survival (PSA-PFS, provided as median and 95% confidence interval [CI]) was explored.  Results:   Low baseline 53BP1 and γ-H2AX foci (P = 0.17) tended to predict early PSA-PD, whereas low SUVmax was significantly associated with higher risk for PSA-PD (P = 0.04). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was a trend towards prolonged PSA-PFS in patients with higher baseline 53BP1 of 6 months (mo; 95%CI, 4-9 mo) compared to 3 mo in patients with low 53BP1 (95% CI, 2-3 mo; P = 0.12). Comparable results were recorded for higher γ-H2AX expression (6 mo [95% CI, 3-9 mo] relative to 3 mo [95% CI, 2-4 mo] in patients with low γ-H2AX; P = 0.12). SUVmax, however, did not demonstrate predictive value (P = 0.29). Consistently, in univariate Cox-regression analysis, baseline 53BP1 foci demonstrated borderline significance for predicting PSA-PFS under [177Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT (P = 0.05).  Conclusion:   In this prospective study investigating mCRPC patients undergoing [177Lu]Lu-PSMA RLT, low baseline DDR-markers in PBLs tended to predict poor outcome.

When a patient is rotated in the horizontal position, gravity causes anatomic deformation. For treatment planning, one feasible method is to acquire simulation images at different horizontal rotation angles.  Purpose:   This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of synthesizing magnetic resonance (MR) images at patient rotation angles of 180° (prone position) and 90° (lateral position) from those at a rotation angle of 0° (supine position) using deep learning.  Methods:   This study included 23 healthy male volunteers. They underwent MR imaging (MRI) in the supine position and then in the prone (23 volunteers) and lateral (16 volunteers) positions. T1-weighted fast spin echo was performed for all positions with the same parameters. Two two-dimensional deep learning networks, pix2pix generative adversarial network (pix2pix GAN) and CycleGAN, were developed for synthesizing MR images in the prone and lateral positions from those in the supine position, respectively. For the evaluation of the models, leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. The mean absolute error (MAE), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to determine the agreement between the prediction and ground truth for the entire body and four specific organs.  Results:   For pix2pix GAN, the synthesized images were visually bad, and no quantitative evaluation was performed. The quantitative evaluation metrics of the body outlines calculated for the synthesized prone and lateral images using CycleGAN were as follows: MAE, 35.63 ± 3.98 and 40.45 ± 5.83, respectively; DSC, 0.97 ± 0.01 and 0.94 ± 0.01, respectively; and HD (in pixels), 16.74 ± 3.55 and 31.69 ± 12.03, respectively. The quantitative metrics of the bladder and prostate performed were also promising for both the prone and lateral images, with mean values >0.90 in DSC (p > 0.05). The mean DSC and HD values of the bilateral femur for the prone images were 0.96 and 3.63 (in pixels), respectively, and 0.78 and 12.65 (in pixels) for the lateral images, respectively (p < 0.05).

Nonresponders had low expression of TGFBR3 and increased activation of the Wnt pathway, cell cycle, upregulation of AR variants, both pre- and posttreatment, with further deletion of AR inhibitor CDK11B posttreatment. Deletion of androgen processing genes, HSD17B11, CYP19A1 were observed in nonresponders posttreatment. Genes involved in cell cycle, DNA repair, Wnt-signaling, and Aurora kinase pathways were differentially expressed between the responder and non-responder at V2. Activation of Wnt signaling in nonresponder and deactivation of MYC or its target genes in responders was detected via SCN loss, somatic mutations, and transcriptomics. Upregulation of genes in the AURKA pathway are consistent with the activation of MYC regulated genes in nonresponders. Several genes in the AKT1 axis had increased mutation rate in nonresponders. We also found evidence of resistance via PDCD1 overexpression in responders.

Results:   A total of 762 men were included, among whom, 76% (581) underwent a TURB alone and 24% (181) a TURB+TURP. There was no difference in terms of tumour characteristics between the groups. We observed comparable length of stay as well as complication rates including major complications (Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥III) for the TURB-alone vs TURB+TURP groups, while the latest led to longer operative time (P < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 44 months, there were more recurrences in the TURB-alone (47%) compared to the TURB+TURP group (28%; P < 0.001). Interestingly, there were more recurrences at the bladder neck/prostatic fossa in the TURB-alone group (55% vs 3%, P < 0.001). TURB+TURP procedures were associated with improved RFS (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29-0.53; P < 0.001), but not PFS (HR 1.63, 95% CI 0.90-2.98; P = 0.11). Within the PSM cohort of 254 patients, the simultaneous TURB+TURP was still associated with improved RFS (HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.22-0.49; P < 0.001). This was also true in the subgroup of 380 patients with recurrence risk factors (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.62; P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   In our contemporary cohort, simultaneous TURB and TURP seems to be an oncologically safe option that may, even, improve RFS by potentially preventing disease recurrence at the bladder neck and in the prostatic fossa.""","""['Ekaterina Laukhtina', 'Marco Moschini', 'Wojciech Krajewski', 'Jeremy Yuen-Chun Teoh', 'Guillaume Ploussard', 'Francesco Soria', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Mara Anna Muenker', 'Mathieu Roumiguie', 'Mario Alvarez-Maestro', 'Vincent Misrai', 'Alessandro Antonelli', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Giuseppe Simone', 'Riccardo Mastroianni', 'Hongda Zhao', 'Razvan-George Rahota', ""David D'Andrea"", 'Keiichiro Mori', 'Simone Albisinni', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Harun Fajkovic', 'Dmitry Enikeev', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Benjamin Pradere;European Association of Urology-Young Academic Urologists(EAU-YAU): Urothelial Carcinoma Working Group']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Kombinierte transurethrale Resektion von Blasenkarzinom und Prostatahyperplasie.', 'Is it oncologically safe performing simultaneous transurethral resection of the bladder and prostate?

Materials and methods:   PD and TCGA-PRAD GEO datasets were downloaded and analyzed through differential expression analysis to determine the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) deregulated in both conditions. Twenty-three m6A RNA methylation-related genes were downloaded in total. The m6A-related genes that overlapped between PRAD and PD were identified as crosstalk genes. Survival analysis was performed on these genes to determine their prognostic values in the overall survival outcomes of prostate cancer. The KEGG pathways were the most significantly enriched by m6A-related crosstalk genes. We also performed lasso regression analysis and univariate survival analysis to identify the most important m6A-related crosstalk genes, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built from these genes.  Results:   Twenty-three m6A methylation-related regulator genes were differentially expressed and deregulated in PRAD and PD.

In the present study we applied Whole Genome DNA Sequencing (WGS) to a group of morphologically normal tissue (n = 51), including benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and non-BPH samples, from men with and men without prostate cancer. We assess whether the observed genetic changes in morphologically normal tissue are linked to the development of cancer in the prostate.  Results:   Single nucleotide variants (P = 7.0 × 10-03, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and small insertions and deletions (indels, P = 8.7 × 10-06) were significantly higher in morphologically normal samples, including BPH, from men with prostate cancer compared to those without. The presence of subclonal expansions under selective pressure, supported by a high level of mutations, were significantly associated with samples from men with prostate cancer (P = 0.035, Fisher exact test). The clonal cell fraction of normal clones was always higher than the proportion of the prostate estimated as epithelial (P = 5.94 × 10-05, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test) which, along with analysis of primary fibroblasts prepared from BPH specimens, suggests a stromal origin. Constructed phylogenies revealed lineages associated with benign tissue that were completely distinct from adjacent tumour clones, but a common lineage between BPH and non-BPH morphologically normal tissues was often observed. Compared to tumours, normal samples have significantly less single nucleotide variants (P = 3.72 × 10-09, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test), have very few rearrangements and a complete lack of copy number alterations.  Conclusions:   Cells within regions of morphologically normal tissue (both BPH and non-BPH) can expand under selective pressure by mechanisms that are distinct from those occurring in adjacent cancer, but that are allied to the presence of cancer. Expansions, which are probably stromal in origin, are characterised by lack of recurrent driver mutations, by almost complete absence of structural variants/copy number alterations, and mutational processes similar to malignant tissue.

Setting:   A retrospective cohort study with patients retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results programme.  Participants:   Patients with nine common solid cancers diagnosed between 2007 and 2016 were included. Patients were excluded if their marital status, insurance status, socioeconomical status, stage or cause of death was unavailable, if survival time was less than 1 month, or if they were younger than 18 years at the time of diagnosis.  Primary and secondary outcome measures:   The primary outcome was CSS, which was compared between married and unmarried individuals. Mediation analyses were conducted to determine the contribution of insurance status to the association between marriage and CSS.  Results:   Married patients had better CSS than those unmarried (time ratio 1.778; 95% CI 1.758 to 1.797). Private health insurance was a key factor mediating the association between marital status and CSS (proportion mediated (PM), 17%; 95% CI 17% to 17.1%). The PM ranges from 10.7% in prostate cancer to 20% in kidney cancer. The contribution of private insurance to the association between marital status and CSS was greater among women than among men (PM 18.5% vs 16.7%). The mediating effect of private insurance was the greatest for the comparison between married and separated individuals (PM 25.6%; 95% CI 25.3% to 25.8%) and smallest for the comparison between married and widowed individuals (PM 11.0%; 95% CI 10.9% to 11.1%).

Evidence conflicts on whether treatment time affects risk of radiotherapy side-effects, likely because of differing time analyses and target tissues. We previously showed interactive effects of time and genotypes of circadian genes on late toxicity after breast radiotherapy and aimed to validate those results in a multi-centre cohort.  Methods:   Clinical and genotype data from 1690 REQUITE breast cancer patients were used with erythema (acute; n=340) and breast atrophy (two years post-radiotherapy; n=514) as primary endpoints. Local datetimes per fraction were converted into solar times as predictors. Genetic chronotype markers were included in logistic regressions to identify primary endpoint predictors.  Findings:   Significant predictors for erythema included BMI, radiation dose and PER3 genotype (OR 1.27(95%CI 1.03-1.56); P < 0.03). Effect of treatment time effect on acute toxicity was inconclusive, with no interaction between time and genotype. For late toxicity (breast atrophy), predictors included BMI, radiation dose, surgery type, treatment time and SNPs in CLOCK (OR 0.62 (95%CI 0.4-0.9); P < 0.01), PER3 (OR 0.65 (95%CI 0.44-0.97); P < 0.04) and RASD1 (OR 0.56 (95%CI 0.35-0.89); P < 0.02). There was a statistically significant interaction between time and genotypes of circadian rhythm genes (CLOCK OR 1.13 (95%CI 1.03-1.23), P < 0.01; PER3 OR 1.1 (95%CI 1.01-1.2), P < 0.04; RASD1 OR 1.15 (95%CI 1.04-1.28), P < 0.008), with peak time for toxicity determined by genotype.  Interpretation:   Late atrophy can be mitigated by selecting optimal treatment time according to circadian genotypes (e.g. treat PER3 rs2087947C/C genotypes in mornings; T/T in afternoons). We predict triple-homozygous patients (14%) reduce chance of atrophy from 70% to 33% by treating in mornings as opposed to mid-afternoon.

The CDK12 gene is often deleted or mutated in PCa and CDK12 deficiency is known to cause homologous recombination repair gene alteration or BRCAness via alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of CDK12 induces AR gene intronic (intron 3) polyadenylation (IPA) usage, AR-V expression, and PCa cell resistance to the antiandrogen enzalutamide (ENZ). We further show that AR binds to the CCNK gene promoter and up-regulates CYCLIN K expression. In contrast, ENZ decreases AR occupancy at the CCNK gene promoter and suppresses CYCLIN K expression. Similar to the effect of the CDK12 inhibitor, CYCLIN K degrader or ENZ treatment promotes AR gene IPA usage, AR-V expression, and ENZ-resistant growth of PCa cells. Importantly, we show that targeting BRCAness induced by CYCLIN K down-regulation with the PARP inhibitor overcomes ENZ resistance. Our findings identify CYCLIN K down-regulation as a key driver of IPA usage, hormonal therapy-induced AR-V expression, and castration resistance in PCa.

We speculated that a CYP11A inhibitor could be administered safely provided that the steroids essential for life are replaced. Virtual screening and systematic structure-activity relationship optimization were used to develop ODM-208, the first-in-class, selective, nonsteroidal, oral CYP11A1 inhibitor. Safety of ODM-208 was assessed in rats and Beagle dogs, and efficacy in a VCaP castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) xenograft mouse model, in mice and dogs, and in six patients with metastatic CRPC. Blood steroid hormone concentrations were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. ODM-208 binds to CYP11A1 and inhibited its enzymatic activity. ODM-208 administration led to rapid, complete, durable, and reversible inhibition of the steroid hormone biosynthesis in an adrenocortical carcinoma cell model in vitro, in adult noncastrated male mice and dogs, and in patients with CRPC. All measured serum steroid hormone concentrations reached undetectable levels within a few weeks from the start of ODM-208 administration. ODM-208 was well tolerated with steroid hormone replacement. The toxicity findings were considered related to CYP11A1 inhibition and were reversed after stopping of the compound administration. Steroid hormone biosynthesis can be effectively inhibited with a small-molecule inhibitor of CYP11A1. The findings suggest that administration of ODM-208 is feasible with concomitant corticosteroid replacement therapy.""","""['Mari Karimaa', 'Reetta Riikonen', 'Henna Kettunen', 'Päivi Taavitsainen', 'Meri Ramela', 'Marcin Chrusciel', 'Stefan Karlsson', 'Petteri Rummakko', 'Outi Simola', 'Gerd Wohlfahrt', 'Pasi Hakulinen', 'Annamari Vuorela', 'Heikki Joensuu', 'Tapio Utriainen', 'Karim Fizazi', 'Riikka Oksala']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Discovery and development of ODM-204: A Novel nonsteroidal compound for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer by blocking the androgen receptor and inhibiting CYP17A1.', 'ODM-204, a Novel Dual Inhibitor of CYP17A1 and Androgen Receptor: Early Results from Phase I Dose Escalation in Men with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Safety and Antitumour Activity of ODM-201 (BAY-1841788) in Castration-resistant, CYP17 Inhibitor-naïve Prostate Cancer: Results from Extended Follow-up of the ARADES Trial.', 'ODM-201: a new-generation androgen receptor inhibitor in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Steroidogenesis in zebrafish and mouse models.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Dysfunctional Lipid Metabolism-The Basis for How Genetic Abnormalities Express the Phenotype of Aggressive Prostate Cancer.']"""

High‑mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1) is an important factor involved in the occurrence and development of a variety of tumours by regulating gene transcription. In the present study, the association between HMGB1 and prostate cancer (PCa) and the effects of HMGB1 on androgen receptor (AR) transcription and signalling pathway reactivation in PCa cells in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. A bioinformatics method was used to determine the mRNA expression level of HMGB1 in PCa specimens and its correlation with the mRNA expression of AR. Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of these proteins in clinical PCa samples. Reporter gene and ChIP assays were performed to determine the activity of AR and the effect of HMGB1 on the ability of AR to bind to the promoters of prostate specific antigen and transmembrane protease, serine 2. A bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assay was employed to observe the direct interaction between HMGB1 and AR protein. Additionally, a castrated nude mouse xenograft tumour model was established to verify the effect of HMGB1 on PCa. The results revealed that HMGB1 expression was significantly increased in PCa specimens, which may have a strong correlation with AR expression. Moreover, HMGB1 could reactivate the AR signalling pathway, directly interact with AR, and promote the development of CRPC in an androgen‑independent manner. The results of the present study indicated that HMGB1 promoted the development of CRPC by interacting with AR, which inferred that decreasing the expression of HMGB1 may be a potential effective method for CRPC prevention and treatment.""","""['Junyu Chen#', 'Duo Xu#', 'Taiwei Wang#', 'Zhaoyun Yang', 'Yanrong Yang', 'Kang He', 'Lijing Zhao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Oncol Rep""","""['Abiraterone switches castration-resistant prostate cancer dependency from adrenal androgens towards androgen receptor variants and glucocorticoid receptor signalling.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'Nrdp1-mediated regulation of ErbB3 expression by the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent but not castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Elevated HMGB1 promotes the malignant progression and contributes to cisplatin resistance of non-small cell lung cancer.', 'A Pegylated Liposome Loaded with Raddeanin A for Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Dipeptidase‑2 is a prognostic marker in lung adenocarcinoma that is correlated with its sensitivity to cisplatin.', 'MCM10: An effective treatment target and a prognostic biomarker in patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.', 'KNL1 is a prognostic and diagnostic biomarker related to immune infiltration in patients with uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma.']"""

Other entities are metastatic BRCA mutated pancreas, prostate and Her2-negative breast cancer. Therefore, patients with allergic reactions to PARP inhibitors should undergo a desensitization procedure to be able to receive this efficient therapy.

However, 5hmC is also cell-type specific, and its variability may exist between differentiated tumor cells and cancer stem cells. Thus, cancer-associated changes in 5hmC may be contributed by distinct sets of tumor cells within the tumor tissues.  Results:   Here, we applied a sensitive immunoprecipitation-based method (hMeDIP-seq) to analyze 5hmC changes during genitourinary carcinogenesis (including prostate, urothelial and kidney). We confirmed the tissue-specific distribution of 5hmC in genitourinary tissues and identified regional gain and global loss of 5hmC coexisting in genitourinary cancers. The genes with gain of 5hmC during tumorigenesis were functionally enriched in regulating stemness and hypoxia, whereas were associated with poor clinical prognosis irrespective of their differences in tumor type. We identified that gain of 5hmC occurred in soft fibrin gel-induced 3D tumor spheres with a tumor-repopulating phenotype in two prostate cancer cell lines, 22RV1 and PC3, compared with conventional two-dimensional (2D) rigid dishes. Then, we defined a malignant signature derived from the differentially hydroxymethylated regions affected genes of cancer stem-like cells, which could predict a worse clinical outcome and identified phenotypically malignant populations of cells from prostate cancer tumors. Notably, an oxidation-resistant vitamin C derivative, ascorbyl phosphate magnesium, restored 5hmC and killed the cancer stem cell-like cells leading to apoptosis in prostate cancer cell lines.

However, challenging applications and recent advances in computer vision suggest that CNNs are limited in their ability to understand the spatial correspondence between features, which is at the core of image registration. The issue is further exaggerated when it comes to multi-modal image registration, where the appearances of input images can differ significantly. This paper presents a novel cross-modal attention mechanism for correlating features extracted from the multi-modal input images and mapping such correlation to image registration transformation. To efficiently train the developed network, a contrastive learning-based pre-training method is also proposed to aid the network in extracting high-level features across the input modalities for the following cross-modal attention learning. We validated the proposed method on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) to magnetic resonance (MR) registration, a clinically important procedure that benefits prostate cancer biopsy. Our experimental results demonstrate that for MR-TRUS registration, a deep neural network embedded with the cross-modal attention block outperforms other advanced CNN-based networks with ten times its size. We also incorporated visualization techniques to improve the interpretability of our network, which helps bring insights into the deep learning based image registration methods.

RECQL4 mutations are associated with developmental defects and cancer. Although RECQL4 mutations lead to disease, RECQL4 overexpression is also observed in cancer, including breast and prostate. Thus, tight regulation of RECQL4 protein levels is crucial for genome stability. Because mammalian RECQL4 is essential, how cells regulate RECQL4 protein levels is largely unknown. Utilizing budding yeast, we investigated the RECQL4 homolog, HRQ1, during DNA crosslink repair. We find that Hrq1 functions in the error-free template switching pathway to mediate DNA intrastrand crosslink repair. Although Hrq1 mediates repair of cisplatin-induced lesions, it is paradoxically degraded by the proteasome following cisplatin treatment. By identifying the targeted lysine residues, we show that preventing Hrq1 degradation results in increased recombination and mutagenesis. Like yeast, human RECQL4 is similarly degraded upon exposure to crosslinking agents. Furthermore, over-expression of RECQL4 results in increased RAD51 foci, which is dependent on its helicase activity. Using bioinformatic analysis, we observe that RECQL4 overexpression correlates with increased recombination and mutations.

A smaller subset of other tumors harbor fusions between TMPRSS2 and members of the ETS transcription factor family other than ERG. To assess the genomic similarity of tumors with non-ERG ETS fusions and those with fusions involving ERG, this study derived a transcriptomic signature of non-ERG ETS fusions and assessed this signature and ERG-related gene expression in 1,050 men with primary prostate cancer from three independent population-based and hospital-based studies. Although non-ERG ETS fusions involving ETV1, ETV4, ETV5, or FLI1 were individually rare, they jointly accounted for one in seven prostate tumors. Genes differentially regulated between non-ERG ETS tumors and tumors without ETS fusions showed similar differential expression when ERG tumors and tumors without ETS fusions were compared (differences explained: R2 = 69-77%), including ETS-related androgen receptor (AR) target genes. Differences appeared to result from similarities among ETS tumors rather than similarities among non-ETS tumors. Gene sets associated with ERG fusions were consistent with gene sets associated with non-ERG ETS fusions, including fatty acid and amino acid metabolism, an observation that was robust across cohorts.

We conducted a discovery analysis in The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate cancer dataset (n = 320; 29% of men >65 years at diagnosis), using linear regressions of age at diagnosis and mRNA expression and adjusting for TMPRSS2:ERG fusion status and race. This analysis identified 13 age-related candidate genes at FDR < 0.1, six of which were also found in an analysis additionally adjusted for Gleason score. We then validated the 13 age-related genes in a transcriptome study nested in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and Physicians' Health Study (n = 374; 53% of men >65 years). Gene expression differences by age in the 13 candidate genes were directionally consistent, and age at diagnosis was weakly associated with the 13-gene score. However, the age-related genes were not consistently associated with risk of metastases and prostate cancer-specific death. Collectively, these findings argue against tumor genomic differences as a main explanation for age-related differences in prostate cancer prognosis.  Prevention relevance:   Older age at diagnosis is consistently associated with worse clinical outcomes in prostate cancer.

In this study, we found that PCa patients with high RHPN1-AS1 expression had a shorter survival time, and RHPN1-AS1 was significantly upregulated in PCa tissues and cells. Based on informatics analysis we predicted that miR-7-5p binds to 3'UTR of RHPN1-AS1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and verified it by luciferase reporter gene assay. Subsequently, we transfected PCa cells with RHPN1-AS1 overexpression vector (RHPN1-AS1), knockdown plasmids (sh-RHPN1-AS1) and/or miR-7-5p mimics or inhibitor and/or overexpression vector (EGFR) or small interfering RNA of EGFR (si-EGFR) or its control, and found that overexpression of RHPN1-AS1 inhibited miR-7-5p expression and promoted EGFR expression, silencing RHPN1-AS1 inhibited proliferation and invasion, and induced G2/M arrest, apoptosis and autophagy in PCa cells. 3MA (an inhibitor of autophagy)-mediated autophagy inhibition attenuated RHPN1-AS1 inhibition-induced apoptosis. Overexpression miR-7-5p or silencing EGFR promoted LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, enhanced autophagy activity, induced cleaved-caspase-3 expression and apoptosis in PCa cells. Furthermore, overexpression of RHPN1-AS1 promoted phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), AKT and mTOR, inhibited LC3-I to LC3-II conversion and reduced apoptosis in PCa cells, while GSK2126458 (an inhibitor of PI3K) reversed the effect of RHPN1-AS1 on PCa cells. In summary, RHPN1-AS1 acted as a ceRNA of miR-7-5p to upregulate EGFR expression, silencing RHPN1-AS1 suppressed PCa tumor progression by inducing autophagy and apoptosis in PCa cells through the miR-7-5p/EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.""","""['Xiulong Ma', 'Hongtao Ren', 'Yang Zhang', 'Baofeng Wang', 'Hongbing Ma']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol""","""['LncRNA RHPN1-AS1 Promotes Cell Proliferation, Migration and Invasion Through Targeting miR-7-5p and Activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Pathway in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Downregulation of lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 Represses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through Mediating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling by miR-342-3p/CUL4B Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Muscleblind-like 1 antisense RNA 1 inhibits cell proliferation, invasion, and migration of prostate cancer by sponging miR-181a-5p and regulating PTEN/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling.', 'A review on the role of LINC00152 in different disorders.', 'Xanthatin suppresses proliferation and tumorigenicity of glioma cells through autophagy inhibition via activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway.', 'The mechanisms and diagnostic potential of lncRNAs, miRNAs, and their related signaling pathways in cervical cancer.', 'Transcriptional profiling of the response to starvation and fattening reveals differential regulation of autophagy genes in mammals.']"""

Adverse events (AEs) were evaluated: incidence, severity, timing, duration, potential overlap of selected AEs, dose modifications/discontinuations due to AEs, and new clinically significant changes in laboratory values and vital signs.  Results:   In the safety population (N = 127; median age 69.0 years), 95.3% (121/127) experienced all-cause treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Most common were anemia (48.8% [62/127]), nausea (33.1% [42/127]), decreased appetite (28.3% [36/127]), and asthenia (23.6% [30/127]). Nonhematologic TEAEs were generally grades 1 and 2. No grade 5 TEAEs or deaths were treatment-related. Hematologic TEAEs typically occurred during the first 4-5 months of treatment. The median duration of grade 3-4 anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia was limited to 7-12 days. No grade 4 events of anemia or neutropenia occurred. Neither BRCA status nor alteration origin significantly impacted the safety profile.

A gene signature for inflammatory responses was constructed on the basis of the data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and validated in external datasets. It was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve, BCR-free survival, Cox regression, and nomogram. Distribution analysis and external model comparison were utilized. Then, enrichment analysis, tumor mutation burden, tumor immune microenvironment, and immune cell infiltration signatures were investigated. The role of the signature in immunotherapy was evaluated. The expression patterns of core genes were verified by RNA sequencing. We identified an IRRGs signature in the TCGA-PRAD cohort and verified it well in two other independent external datasets. The signature was a robust and independent prognostic index for predicting the BCR of PCa. The high-risk group of our signature predicted a shortened BCR time and an aggressive disease progression. A nomogram was constructed to predict BCR-free time in clinical practices. Neutrophils and CD8+ T cells were in higher abundance among the low-risk individuals.

It is an urgent need to explore novel biomarkers for accurate diagnosis and targets for the effective treatment of PCa. This study aimed to investigate the effects of RAB3D (which belongs to the secretory Rab GTPases) on the progression of PCa. The results showed that RAB3D was highly expressed in PCa tissues compared to normal tissues according to the gene expression omnibus dataset. Consistent with the bioinformatics results, RAB3D exhibited a higher expression in PCa cells. Overexpression of RAB3D promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells, whereas the knockdown of RAB3D led to the opposite results. The procancer effects of RAB3D were further confirmed by the in vivo growth of xenograft model. Subsequently, RAB3D upregulated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway both in vivo and in vitro. LY294002 (a PI3K inhibitor) rescued the RAB3D upregulation-induced promotion of malignant phenotypes of PCa cells. Furthermore, the transcription activity of RAB3D was found to be enhanced by aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR; a transcription factor).

Methods:   A retrospective observational study was conducted, in which we analyzed patients who underwent ORP at our institution between 2003 and 2020. The biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were defined using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank analysis. Multivariable Cox-regression models were used to test the effect of other different factors such as preoperative PSA, Gleason score and T stage on biochemical recurrence. The Clavien-Dindo classification was used to report the complication rates.  Results:   In total, 1040 patients were included. PNI was found in 458 (44.1%) and BCR occurred in 212 patients (20.4%) at a median follow-up of 91.2 months. After undergoing the procedure, 216 patients received adjuvant external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Despite receiving adjuvant treatment, the BCR-free survival was still significantly shorter for PNI-positive patients (mean 32.2 vs. 62.3 months, p < 0.001). The 5- and 10-year BCR-free survival rates for patients without PNI were 90% and 81%, respectively. For the same period of time, BCR-free survival rates for patients with PNI were 75 and 63%, respectively. Therefore, PNI was a strong predictor of BCR (p < 0.001). These results remained even after controlling for established predictors of biochemical recurrence. Limitations include retrospective and single-center study design.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, despite its limitations, our study emphasizes the prognostic importance of PNI in prostate cancer patients.

Design, setting, and participants:   In this observational study, data for demographic, preoperative, and postoperative variables for patients who underwent RAPN were extracted from the Vattikuti Collective Quality Initiative (VCQI) database.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   IOAEs were defined as the occurrence of intraoperative surgical complications, blood transfusion, or conversion to open surgery/radical nephrectomy. Backward stepwise logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of IOAEs.

Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to determine the clinical utility of the model.  Results and limitations:   Among the 2114 patients in the study cohort, IOAEs were noted in 158 (7.5%). Multivariable analysis identified five variables as independent predictors of IOAEs: RENAL nephrometry score (odds ratio [OR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.25); clinical tumor size (OR 1.01, 95% CI 1.001-1.024); PN indication as absolute versus elective (OR 3.9, 95% CI 2.6-5.7) and relative versus elective (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.2-8); Charlson comorbidity index (OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30); and multifocal tumors (OR 8.8, 95% CI 5.4-14.1).

Objective:   To externally validate available models for prediction of ECE.  Design, setting, and participants:   Sixteen models were assessed in a cohort of 737 consecutive PCa patients diagnosed via multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-targeted and systematic biopsies and treated with RP between January 2016 and November 2021 at eight referral centers.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Model performance was evaluated in terms of discrimination using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results and limitations:   Overall, ECE was identified in 308/1474 (21%) prostatic lobes. Prostatic lobes with ECE had higher side-specific clinical stage on digital rectal examination and MRI, number of positive biopsy cores, and International Society of Urological Pathology grade group in comparison to those without ECE (all p < 0.0001). Less optimistic performance was observed in comparison to previous published studies, although the models described by Pak, Patel, Martini, and Soeterik achieved the highest accuracy (AUC ranging from 0.73 to 0.77), adequate calibration for a probability threshold <40%, and the highest net benefit for a probability threshold >8% on DCA. Inclusion of MRI-targeted biopsy data and MRI information in models improved patient selection and clinical usefulness. Using model-derived cutoffs suggested by their authors, approximately 15% of positive surgical margins could have been avoided. Some available models were not included because of missing data, which constitutes a limitation of the study.  Conclusions:   We report an external validation of models predicting ECE and identified the four with the best performance. These models should be applied for preoperative planning and patient counseling.  Patient summary:   We validated several tools for predicting extension of prostate cancer outside the prostate gland. These tools can improve patient selection for surgery that spares nerves affecting recovery of sexual potency after removal of the prostate.

Associations with presence of any PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa; Gleason ≥3 + 4) were evaluated using linear regression (interaction by volume quartile), logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristics.  Results:   Among 640 men, TRUS underestimated prostate volume relative to mpMRI (median 49.2cc vs. 54.1cc) with 8% lower volume per cc up to 77.5cc (First-third quartile) and 39% lower volume per additional cc above 77.5cc (fourth quartile). For men undergoing radical prostatectomy, mpMRI had a higher correlation coefficient relative to TRUS (0.913 vs 0.878) when compared to surgical pathology. mpMRI PSAD had slightly higher odds vs TRUS PSAD for detecting any PCa (OR 2.94 and OR 2.78, both P <.001) or csPCa (OR 4.20 and OR 4.02, both P <.001).

Recently, attempts have been made to use machine learning to automate the segmentation of functional structures such as the prostate gland, rectum, and bladder. However, a paucity of material is available to segment extracapsular structures that are known to cause needle deflection during percutaneous interventions. This research aims to explore the feasibility of the automatic segmentation of prostate and extracapsular structures to predict needle deflection.  Methods:   Using pelvic magnetic resonance imagings (MRIs), 3D U-Net was trained and optimized for the prostate and extracapsular structures (bladder, rectum, pubic bone, pelvic diaphragm muscle, bulbospongiosus muscle, bull of the penis, ischiocavernosus muscle, crus of the penis, transverse perineal muscle, obturator internus muscle, and seminal vesicle). The segmentation accuracy was validated by putting intra-procedural MRIs into the 3D U-Net to segment the prostate and extracapsular structures in the image. Then, the segmented structures were used to predict deflected needle path in in-bore MRI-guided biopsy using a model-based approach.  Results:   The 3D U-Net yielded Dice scores to parenchymal organs (0.61-0.83), such as prostate, bladder, rectum, bulb of the penis, crus of the penis, but lower in muscle structures (0.03-0.31), except and obturator internus muscle (0.71). The 3D U-Net showed higher Dice scores for functional structures ([Formula: see text]0.001) and complication-related structures ([Formula: see text]0.001). The segmentation of extracapsular anatomies helped to predict the deflected needle path in MRI-guided prostate interventions of the prostate with the accuracy of 0.9 to 4.9 mm.  Conclusion:   Our segmentation method using 3D U-Net provided an accurate anatomical understanding of the prostate and extracapsular structures. In addition, our method was suitable for segmenting functional and complication-related structures. Finally, 3D images of the prostate and extracapsular structures could simulate the needle pathway to predict needle deflections.""","""['Satoshi Kobayashi', 'Franklin King#', 'Nobuhiko Hata#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Comput Assist Radiol Surg""","""['Machine Segmentation of Pelvic Anatomy in MRI-Assisted Radiosurgery (MARS) for Prostate Cancer Brachytherapy.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', 'CAN3D: Fast 3D medical image segmentation via compact context aggregation.', 'Fully automated organ segmentation in male pelvic CT images.']"""

Methods:   Patients with suspected prostate cancer underwent transrectal MRI fusion biopsy with the Koelis trinity device. Two focal therapy eligibility criteria were subsequently defined: Group 1: PSA ≤ 15 ng/ml, unilateral csPCa, ISUP grade ≤ 2, no contralateral PIRADS 3-5 lesion; Group 2: same criteria but ISUP grade 3. These subgroups were correlated with histopathological post-prostatectomy parameters for stage pT2, unilateral csPCa, no ISUP upgrading. In addition, parameters of csPCa detection were analyzed for patients undergoing primary and re-biopsy.  Results:   Four hundred fourteen consecutive patients were analyzed (314 for primary biopsy, 100 for re-biopsy). Post-prostatectomy whole mount section analysis was available from 155 patients. 39 and 62 of these patients met focal therapy inclusion criteria for group 1 and group 2, respectively. A correlation with final pathology parameters following radical prostatectomy (stage pT2, unilateral csPCa, no ISUP upgrading) revealed a positive predictive value of only 53.8% and 64.5% for Group 1 and 2, respectively. The overall csPCa detection rate was 73.7%. In the re-biopsy group 20% additional patients with csPCa were detected by targeted biopsy.  Conclusion:   Despite high csPCa detection rates following MRI fusion biopsy our study demonstrated that, using final pathology to confirm locally advanced tumor stage, presence of bilateral csPCa and ISUP upgrading, between 35.5 and 46.2% of patients would have been incorrectly selected for focal therapy.""","""['Roman Ganzer#', 'Alexander Mangold#', 'Fiona Sofia Siokou', 'Christian Brinkschmidt', 'Wolfgang Brummeisl']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Head-to-head Comparison of Transrectal Ultrasound-guided Prostate Biopsy Versus Multiparametric Prostate Resonance Imaging with Subsequent Magnetic Resonance-guided Biopsy in Biopsy-naïve Men with Elevated Prostate-specific Antigen: A Large Prospective Multicenter Clinical Study.', 'Multicenter transperineal MRI-TRUS fusion guided outpatient clinic prostate biopsies under local anesthesia.', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transperineal Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion-guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsy-A Systematic Review.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound fusion image-guided prostate biopsy: Current status of the cancer detection and the prospects of tailor-made medicine of the prostate cancer.']"""

The aim of this study was to investigate time trends in BC and PC mortality rates in Lithuania evaluating the effects of age, calendar period of death, and birth-cohort over a 35-year time span.  Methods:   We obtained death certification data for BC in women and PC in men for Lithuania during the period 1986-2020 from the World Health Organisation database. Age-standardised mortality rates were analysed using Joinpoint regression. Age-period-cohort models were used to assess the independent age, period and cohort effects on the observed mortality trends.  Results:   Joinpoint regression analysis indicated that BC mortality increased by 1.6% annually until 1996, and decreased by - 1.2% annually thereafter. The age-period-cohort analysis suggests that temporal trends in BC mortality rates could be attributed mainly to cohort effects. The cohort effect curvature showed the risk of BC death increased in women born prior to 1921, remained stable in cohorts born around 1921-1951 then decreased; however, trend reversed in more recent generations. The period effect curvature displayed a continuous decrease in BC mortality since 1991-1995. For PC mortality, after a sharp increase by 3.0%, rates declined from 2007 by - 1.7% annually. The period effect was predominant in PC mortality, the curvature displaying a sharp increase until 2001-2005, then decrease.  Conclusions:   Modestly declining recent trends in BC and PC mortality are consistent with the introduction of widespread mammography and PSA testing, respectively, lagging up to 10 years. The study did not show that screening programme introduction played a key role in BC mortality trends in Lithuania. Screening may have contributed to favourable recent changes in PC mortality rates in Lithuania, however the effect was moderate and limited to age groups < 65 years.

Methods:   Sagittal 2D cine-MRI scans were acquired at 4 Hz during treatment at a ViewRay MRIdian (ViewRay Inc., Oakwood Village, OH, USA) MR linac. Prostate shifts in anterior-posterior (AP) and superior-inferior (SI) directions were extracted separately. Using the static dose cloud approximation, the planned fractional dose was shifted according to the 2D gated motion (residual motion in gating window) to estimate the delivered dose by superimposing and averaging the shifted dose volumes. The dose of a hypothetical non-gated delivery was reconstructed similarly using the non-gated motion. For the clinical target volume (CTV), rectum, and bladder, dose-volume histogram parameters of the planned and reconstructed doses were compared.  Results:   In total, 174 fractions (15.7 h of cine-MRI) from 10 patients were evaluated. The average (±1 σ) non-gated prostate motion was 0.6 ± 1.0 mm in the AP and 0.0 ± 0.6 mm in the SI direction with respect to the centroid position of the gating boundary. 95% of the shifts were within [-3.5, 2.7] mm in the AP and [-2.9, 3.2] mm in the SI direction. For the gated treatment and averaged over all fractions, CTV D98% decreased by less than 2% for all patients. The rectum and the bladder D2% increased by less than 3% and 0.5%, respectively. Doses reconstructed for gated and non-gated delivery were similar for most fractions.  Conclusion:   A pipeline for extraction of prostate motion during gated MRI-guided radiotherapy based on 2D cine-MRI was implemented. The 2D motion data enabled an approximate estimation of the delivered dose.

Patients received an integrated boost of 82 Gy (cohorts A and C) or 67 Gy (cohort B) to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging identified lesion(s). Primary endpoint was late Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity at 1 year. Secondary endpoints were acute and late toxicity (clinician and patient reported) and freedom from biochemical/clinical failure at 5 years.  Results:   Two hundred and sixty-five men were recruited and 256 were treated (55 cohort A, 153 cohort B, and 48 cohort C). Median follow-up for each cohort was >5 years.

Methods:   We identified 1350 men with an mpMRI suspicious lesion (PI-RADS ≥ 3), defined as IL, who underwent TBx and SBx at three referral centres. The outcome was SBx added value in csPCa (grade group ≥ 2 PCa detected at SBx and missed by TBx) detection. To this aim, we performed multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVA). Furthermore, we explored the interaction between IL volume and SBx csPCa added value, across different PI-RADS categories, using lowess function.  Results:   Overall, 569 (42%) men had csPCa at TBx and 78 (6%) csPCa were identified at SBx only. At MVA PSA (OR 0.90; p < 0.05) and IL volume (OR 0.58; p < 0.05) were associated with SBx csPCa added value. At interaction analyses, a nonlinear correlation between PI-RADS and SBx csPCa added value was identified with a decrease from roughly 10 to 4% followed by a substantial plateau at 1.2 ml and 0.6 ml for PI-RADS 3 and 4, respectively. For PI-RADS 5 lesions SBx csPCa added was constantly lower than 4%.  Conclusions:   Increasing IL volume in PI-RADS 3 and 4 lesions is associated with reduction in SBx csPCa added value. For diagnostic purposes, SBx could be omitted in men with IL larger than 1.2 ml and 0.6 ml for PI-RADS 3 and 4, respectively.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the commonest of these diseases. The degree of enlargement of the prostate may determine the amount of PSA elaborated. Several reports in some parts of the world have shown a significant correlation between prostate volume (PV) and PSA. However, only a few reports have been documented in Nigeria, especially in the South-South region.  Aim:   This research aimed to ascertain if there is any correlation between prostate volume (PV), total PSA (tPSA), and free PSA (fPSA) in men with histologically diagnosed BPH. This knowledge may help in the estimation of PV from a given PSA.  Patients and methods:   This prospective hospital-based study was carried out in a southern Nigerian tertiary hospital between November 2017 and October 2018. Eighty (80) eligible and consenting patients participated in the study and were enrolled at first contact in the urology clinic. Each patient's blood was taken for PSA estimation. The prostate volume was estimated by transrectal ultrasound scan (TRUS). Those who had tPSA values greater than 4 ng/mL whose biopsy report showed prostate malignancy were excluded from the study. A proforma was used to collect patients' sociodemographic and clinical information. Data were entered and analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, United States). For all statistical tests, P < 0.05 was regarded as significant.  Results:   The mean age of the patients for this study was 68.03 years. The mean prostate volume was 87.9 mL with a range of 34 to 234 mL. The mean tPSA was 5.5 ng/mL with ranges of 1.1 to 21.1 ng/mL. There was a significant correlation between PV and tPSA with a P value of 0.0001. This correlation was also shown between PV and fPSA with a P value of 0.0001.  Conclusion:   There is a statistically significant correlation between PV and PSA (both free and total) in men with symptomatic histologically diagnosed BPH. This finding showed that larger benign prostate glands elaborated greater amounts of PSA. It may, therefore, be appropriate to say that it is not in all cases of elevated serum tPSA that the possibilities of malignancy or inflammation should be entertained.""","""['E Aigbe', 'E Irekpita', 'F E Ogbetere', 'U I Alili']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Niger J Clin Pract""","""['Free prostate-specific antigen outperforms total prostate-specific antigen as a predictor of prostate volume in patients without prostate cancer.', 'Relationships between total/free prostate-specific antigen and prostate volume in Chinese men with biopsy-proven benign prostatic hyperplasia.', 'Significance and limitations of f/tPSA in differential diagnosis of prostate cancer with tPSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml.', 'Sclerosing Adenosis of the Prostate-A Benign Lesion Similar to Prostate Cancer: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'The Prostate as an Endocrine Organ: Its Modulation of Serum Testosterone.']"""

Overexpression of suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) increases migration of prostate cancer cells, while depletion of SUV39H1 suppresses migration of prostate cancer cells.  Aim:   In this study, the aim was to show the relationships of AR and SUV39H1 with adenomyomatous hyperplasia (AH) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PCa).  Materials and methods:   70 AH and 70 PCa preparations in Pathology Department from 2013 to 16 were retrospectively investigated. Samples with immunohistochemical staining for AR and SUV39H1 were evaluated with a light microscope. After pathologic investigation of samples, AR and SUV39H1 expressions were scored. The changes in the frequencies of the obtained scores in the AH and PCa groups were analyzed statistically.  Results:   AR expression was observed to be greater in AH compared to PCa. This difference was found to be statistically significant (p = 0.003). SUV39H1 expression was identified to be greater in PCa compared to AH and this showed statistical significance (p = 0.031). PCa samples were identified to have nearly 1.5 times more SUV39H1 mild staining compared to AH samples and this increase was two times for SUV39H1 strong staining.  Conclusion:   In our study, AR expression was greater in AH compared to PCa samples. This situation is inverse to the known mechanism and cannot be clearly explained. It needs to be supported with large series and other prognostic parameters.

Aims:   To prospectively investigate the associations of dietary intakes of total protein, protein from different dietary sources, and amino acids with prostate cancer risk and mortality.  Methods:   In 131,425 men from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, protein and amino acid intakes were estimated using validated dietary questionnaires. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   During a mean follow-up of 14.2 years, 6939 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer and 914 died of the disease. Dairy protein was positively associated with overall prostate cancer risk in the three highest fifths compared to the lowest (HRQ3 =1.14 (95% CI 1.05-1.23); HRQ 4=1.09 (1.01-1.18); HRQ5 =1.10 (1.02-1.19)); similar results were observed for yogurt protein (HRQ3 =1.14 (1.05-1.24); HRQ4 =1.09 (1.01-1.18); HRQ5 =1.12 (1.04-1.21)). For egg protein intake and prostate cancer mortality, no association was observed by fifths, but there was suggestive evidence of a positive association in the analysis per standard deviation increment.

Copper chelator neocuproine and reactive oxygen species scavengers (thiourea for hydroxyl radical and superoxide dismutase for superoxide anion) significantly inhibit this reaction thus demonstrating that intracellular copper reacts with anthocyanidins in cancer cells to cause DNA damage via ROS generation. We further show that copper-supplemented media sensitizes normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) to Del-mediated growth inhibition as determined by decreased cell proliferation. Copper supplementation results in increased expression of copper transporters Ctr1 and ATP7A in MCF-10A cells, which is attenuated by the addition of Del in the medium.

Then survival analysis was performed on cleansed database. Results: The incidence of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer increased, while standardized rates of lung and cervical cancer declined. The survival of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer showed improvement. Contrarily, lung cancer exhibited a mild decline, while that of cervical cancer did not change significantly. In earlier stages survival was improved among almost every studied tumor type, while in advanced stages improvement was not observed. Comparison of stage distribution revealed that in the 2011-2015 period colorectal, breast and prostate cancer cases were diagnosed at earlier stages, while lung and cervical cancer patients were typically discovered at more advanced stages.

The progression of prostate cancer (PCa) to resistant forms of the disease (castration-resistant PCa, CRPC) is associated with poor prognosis and life quality, with current limited therapeutic options. CRPC is characterized by a high glucose consumption, which poses as an opportunity to direct AgNPs to these cancer cells. Thus, this study explores the effect of glucose functionalization of AgNPs in PCa and CRPC cell lines (LNCaP, Du-145 and PC-3).  Methods:   AgNPs were synthesized, further functionalized, and their physical and chemical composition was characterized both in water and in culture medium, through UV-visible spectrum, dynamic light scattering (DLS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Their effect was assessed in the cell lines regarding AgNPs' entering pathway, cellular proliferation capacity, ROS production, mitochondrial membrane depolarization, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis evaluation.  Results:   AgNPs displayed an average size of 61nm and moderate monodispersity with a slight increase after functionalization, and a round shape. These characteristics remained stable when redispersed in culture medium. Both AgNPs and G-AgNPs were cytotoxic only to CRPC cells and not to hormone-sensitive ones and their effect was higher after functionalization showing the potential of glucose to favor AgNPs' uptake by cancer cells. Entering through endocytosis and being encapsulated in lysosomes, the NPs increased the ROS, inducing mitochondrial damage, and arresting cell cycle in S Phase, therefore blocking proliferation, and inducing apoptosis.  Conclusion:   The nanoparticles synthesized in the present study revealed good characteristics and stability for administration to cancer cells. Their uptake through endocytosis leads to promising cytotoxic effects towards CRPC cells, revealing the potential of G-AgNPs as a future therapeutic approach to improve the management of patients with PCa resistant to hormone therapy or metastatic disease.""","""['Mariana Morais#', 'Vera Machado#', 'Francisca Dias', 'Patrícia Figueiredo', 'Carlos Palmeira', 'Gabriela Martins', 'Rui Fernandes', 'Ana Rita Malheiro', 'Kirsi S Mikkonen', 'Ana Luísa Teixeira', 'Rui Medeiros']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['The Role of Silver Nanoparticles in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer: Are There Any Perspectives for the Future?', 'Phytosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles Using Perilla frutescens Leaf Extract: Characterization and Evaluation of Antibacterial, Antioxidant, and Anticancer Activities.', 'Comparative assessment of the apoptotic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized by Bacillus tequilensis and Calocybe indica in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells: targeting p53 for anticancer therapy.', 'Potential anticancer activity of biogenic silver nanoparticles using leaf extract of Rhynchosia suaveolens: an insight into the mechanism.', 'Synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from leaf extract of Salvia miltiorrhiza and its anticancer potential in human prostate cancer LNCaP\xa0cell lines.', 'Functionalized Metal Nanoparticles in Cancer Therapy.', 'Green Nanoformulations of Polyvinylpyrrolidone-Capped Metal Nanoparticles: A Study at the Hybrid Interface with Biomimetic Cell Membranes and In Vitro Cell Models.', 'The Role of Silver Nanoparticles in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer: Are There Any Perspectives for the Future?']"""

We, therefore, aimed to develop a method that allowed the estimation of blood clearance kinetics in vitro. For this purpose, 177Lu-labeled PSMA radioligands were subjected to a SEC column with human serum albumin (HSA) dissolved in a mobile phase. The HSA-mediated retention time of each PSMA ligand generated by this novel 'albumin-mediated size exclusion chromatography' (AMSEC) was converted to a ligand-specific apparent molecular weight (MWapp), and a normalization accounting for unspecific interactions between individual radioligands and the SEC column matrix was applied. The resulting normalized MWapp,norm. could serve to estimate the blood clearance of renally excreted radioligands by means of their influence on the highly size-selective process of glomerular filtration (GF). Based on the correlation between MW and the glomerular sieving coefficients (GSCs) of a set of plasma proteins, GSCcalc values were calculated to assess the relative differences in the expected GF/blood clearance kinetics in vivo and to select lead candidates among the evaluated radioligands. Significant differences in the MWapp,norm. and GSCcalc values, even for stereoisomers, were found, indicating that AMSEC might be a valuable and high-resolution tool for the preclinical selection of therapeutic lead compounds for clinical translation.""","""['Jan-Philip Kunert', 'Sebastian Fischer', 'Alexander Wurzer', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Pharmaceuticals (Basel)""","""['Development of a new class of PSMA radioligands comprising ibuprofen as an albumin-binding entity.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'Glu-Ureido-Based Inhibitors of Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen: Lessons Learned During the Development of a Novel Class of Low-Molecular-Weight Theranostic Radiotracers.', 'PSMA-Based Radioligand Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: The Bad Berka Experience Since 2013.', 'Development of the First 18F-Labeled Radiohybrid-Based Minigastrin Derivative with High Target Affinity and Tumor Accumulation by Substitution of the Chelating Moiety.', 'Introduction of a SiFA Moiety into the D-Glutamate Chain of DOTA-PP-F11N Results in Radiohybrid-Based CCK-2R-Targeted Compounds with Improved Pharmacokinetics In Vivo.']"""

Chitosan (CS) modified reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposite (CS-rGO) was easily synthesized by the chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO) using CS as a dispersant and biofunctionalizing agent. When CS-rGO was modified on the patterned ITO, CS offered high biocompatibility and reactive groups for the immobilization of recognition antibodies and rGO acted as a transduction element and enhancer to improve the electronic conductivity and stability of the CS-rGO composite film. The affinity-based biosensing interface was constructed by covalent immobilization of a specific polyclonal anti-PSA antibody (Ab) on the amino-enriched electrode surface via a facile glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linking method, which was followed by the use of bovine serum albumin to block the non-specific sites. The immunosensor allowed the detection of PSA in a wide range from 1 to 5 ng mL-1 with a low limit of detection of 0.8 pg mL-1.

Here, we hypothesized that this compound may decrease the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in prostate cancer cells, increase the level of mitochondrial ROS, alleviate tumor hypoxia, and radiosensitize tumors.  Methods:   OCR and mitochondrial superoxide production were assessed by EPR (9 GHz) in vitro in PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells. Reduced and oxidized glutathione were assessed before and after MM10 exposure. Tumor oxygenation was measured in vivo using 1 GHz EPR oximetry in PC-3 tumor model. Tumors were irradiated at the time of maximal reoxygenation.  Results:   24-hours exposure to MM10 significantly decreased the OCR of PC-3 and DU-145 cancer cells. An increase in mitochondrial superoxide levels was observed in PC-3 but not in DU-145 cancer cells, an observation consistent with the differences observed in glutathione levels in both cancer cell lines. In vivo, the tumor oxygenation significantly increased in the PC-3 model (daily injection of 2 mg/kg MM10) 48 and 72 h after initiation of the treatment. Despite the significant effect on tumor hypoxia, MM10 combined to irradiation did not increase the tumor growth delay compared to the irradiation alone.

Several cytotoxic approaches have been used over the years to overcome this public health threat, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Cyanine dyes are a class of compounds that have been extensively studied as PDT sensitisers; nevertheless, their antiproliferative potential in the absence of a light source has been scarcely explored. Herein, the synthesis of eighteen symmetric mono-, tri-, and heptamethine cyanine dyes and their evaluation as potential anticancer agents is described. The influences of the heterocyclic nature, counterion, and methine chain length on the antiproliferative effects and selectivities were analysed, and relevant structure-activity relationship data were gathered. The impact of light on the cytotoxic activity of the most promising dye was also assessed and discussed. Most of the monomethine and trimethine cyanine dyes under study demonstrated a high antiproliferative effect on human tumour cell lines of colorectal (Caco-2), breast (MCF-7), and prostate (PC-3) cancer at the initial screening (10 µM). However, concentration-viability curves showed higher potency and selectivity for the Caco-2 cell line. A monomethine cyanine dye derived from benzoxazole was the most promising compound (IC50 for Caco-2 = 0.67 µM and a selectivity index of 20.9 for Caco-2 versus normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF)) and led to Caco-2 cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.

Indeed, participants donating this biofluid for such purposes, including the identification, validation and quantification of surrogate biomarkers, may easily self-collect such samples in their homes following the provision of full collection details to them by researchers. In this report, the authors have focused on the applications of metabolomics technologies to the diagnosis and progressive severity monitoring of human cancer conditions, firstly oral cancers (e.g., oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma), and secondly extra-oral (systemic) cancers such as lung, breast and prostate cancers. For each publication reviewed, the authors provide a detailed evaluation and critical appraisal of the experimental design, sample size, ease of sample collection (usually but not exclusively as whole mouth saliva (WMS)), their transport, length of storage and preparation for analysis. Moreover, recommended protocols for the optimisation of NMR pulse sequences for analysis, along with the application of methods and techniques for verifying and resonance assignments and validating the quantification of biomolecules responsible, are critically considered. In view of the authors' specialisms and research interests, the majority of these investigations were conducted using NMR-based metabolomics techniques.

Drug therapy, chemotherapy, and radical prostatectomy are the primary treatment methods, but drug resistance and postoperative recurrence often occur. Therefore, seeking novel anti-tumor compounds with high efficiency and low toxicity from natural products can produce a new tumor treatment method. Matijin-Su [N-(N-benzoyl-L-phenylalanyl)-O-acetyl-L-phenylalanol, MTS] is a phenylalanine dipeptide monomer compound that is isolated from the Chinese ethnic medicine Matijin (Dichondra repens Forst.). Its derivatives exhibit various pharmacological activities, especially anti-tumor. Among them, the novel MTS derivative HXL131 has a significant inhibitory effect against prostate tumor growth and metastasis. This study is designed to investigate the effects of HXL131 on the growth and metastasis of human PCa cell lines PC3 and its molecular mechanism through in vitro experiments combined with proteomics, molecular docking, and gene silencing. The in vitro results showed that HXL131 concentration dependently inhibited PC3 cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, arrested cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and inhibited cell migration capacity. A proteomic analysis and a Western blot showed that HXL131 up-regulated the expression of proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and migration-related proteins CYR61, TIMP1, SOD2, IL6, SERPINE2, DUSP1, TNFSF9, OSMR, TNFRSF10D, and TNFRSF12A. Molecular docking, a cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), and gene silencing showed that HXL131 had a strong binding affinity with DUSP1 and TNFSF9, which are important target genes for inhibiting the growth and metastasis of PC3 cells. This study demonstrates that HXL131 exhibited excellent anti-prostate cancer activity and inhibited the growth and metastasis of prostate cancer cells by regulating the expression of DUSP1 and TNFSF9.""","""['Lanlan Li', 'Mingfei Yang', 'Jia Yu', 'Sha Cheng', 'Mashaal Ahmad', 'Caihong Wu', 'Xinwei Wan', 'Bixue Xu', 'Yaacov Ben-David', 'Heng Luo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['A novel L-phenylalanine dipeptide inhibits prostate cancer cell proliferation by targeting TNFSF9.', 'Dual specificity phosphatase 1 expression inversely correlates with NF-κB activity and expression in prostate cancer and promotes apoptosis through a p38 MAPK dependent mechanism.', 'Evaluation of the anticancer and anti-metastasis effects of novel synthetic sodium channel blockers in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.', 'Synthesis and anti-tumor activity evaluation of Matijin-Su derivatives.', 'Dichondra repens J.R.Forst. and G.Forst.: A Review of Its Traditional Uses, Chemistry, Pharmacology, Toxicology and Applications.']"""

The expression of many miRNAs is often found deregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Although their expression can be associated with PCa and CRPC, their functions and regulatory activity in cancer development are poorly understood. In this study, we used different proteomics tools to analyze the activity of hsa-miR-3687-3p (miR-3687) and hsa-miR-4417-3p (miR-4417), two miRNAs upregulated in CRPC. PCa and CRPC cell lines were transfected with miR-3687 or miR-4417 to overexpress the miRNAs. Cell lysates were analyzed using 2D gel electrophoresis and proteins were subsequently identified using mass spectrometry (Maldi-MS/MS). A whole cell lysate, without 2D-gel separation, was analyzed by ESI-MS/MS. The expression of deregulated proteins found across both methods was further investigated using Western blotting. Gene ontology and cellular process network analysis determined that miR-3687 and miR-4417 are involved in diverse regulatory mechanisms that support the CRPC phenotype, including metabolism and inflammation. Moreover, both miRNAs are associated with extracellular vesicles, which point toward a secretory mechanism. The tumor protein D52 isoform 1 (TD52-IF1), which regulates neuroendocrine trans-differentiation, was found to be substantially deregulated in androgen-insensitive cells by both miR-3687 and miR-4417. These findings show that these miRNAs potentially support the CRPC by truncating the TD52-IF1 expression after the onset of androgen resistance.""","""['Simone Venz', 'Heike Junker', 'Erik Ultsch', 'Franziska Hetke', 'Elke Krüger', 'Martin Burchardt', 'Pedro Caetano-Pinto', 'Cindy Roennau']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Upregulation of miR-3195, miR-3687 and miR-4417 is associated with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Functional roles of miR-625-5p and miR-874-3p in the progression of castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Impact of novel miR-145-3p regulatory networks on survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Microfluidic-based prostate cancer model for investigating the secretion of prostate-specific antigen and microRNAs in vitro.', 'Bioinformatics Analysis of the Prognostic Significance of CAND1 in ERα-Positive Breast Cancer.']"""

This genus has been reported to have biological capabilities; however, research has been conducted on Dryopteris juxtapostia. Therefore, with the present study, we aimed to exploring the biological potential of D. juxtapostia root and shoot extracts. We extracted dichloromethane and methanol separately from the roots and shoots of D. juxtapostia. Antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH, FRAP, and H2O2 assays, and anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated using both in vitro (antiurease activity) and in vivo (carrageenan- and formaldehyde-induced paw edema) studies. Toxicity was evaluated by adopting a brine shrimp lethality assay followed by determination of cytotoxic activity using an MTT assay. Hepatoprotective effects of active crude extracts were examined in rats. Activity-bearing compounds were tentatively identified using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Results suggested that D. juxtapostia root dichloromethane extract exhibited better antioxidant (DPPH, IC50 of 42.0 µg/mL; FRAP, 46.2 mmol/g; H2O2, 71% inhibition), anti-inflammatory (urease inhibition, 56.7% at 50 µg/mL; carrageenan-induced edema inhibition, 61.7% at 200 µg/mL; formaldehyde-induced edema inhibition, 67.3% at 200 µg/mL), brine shrimp % mortality (100% at 1000 µg/mL), and cytotoxic (HeLa cancer, IC50 of 17.1 µg/mL; prostate cancer (PC3), IC50 of 45.2 µg/mL) effects than D. juxtapostia root methanol extract. D. juxtapostia shoot dichloromethane and methanol extracts exhibited non-influential activity in all biological assays and were not selected for hepatoprotective study. D. juxtapostia root methanol extract showed improvement in hepatic cell structure and low cellular infiltration but, in contrast the dichloromethane extract, did not show any significant improvement in hepatocyte morphology, cellular infiltration, or necrosis of hepatocytes in comparison to the positive control, i.e., paracetamol. LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis showed the presence of albaspidin PP, 3-methylbutyryl-phloroglucinol, flavaspidic acid AB and BB, filixic acid ABA and ABB, tris-desaspidin BBB, tris-paraaspidin BBB, tetra-flavaspidic BBBB, tetra-albaspidin BBBB, and kaempferol-3-O-glucoside in the dichloromethane extract, whereas kaempferol, catechin, epicatechin, quinic acid, liquitrigenin, and quercetin 7-O-galactoside in were detected in the methanol extract, along with all the compounds detected in the dichloromethane extract.

Prostate cancer is notoriously heterogeneous, which makes it hard to generate and study in pre-clinical models. The family of Forkhead box (FOX) transcription factors are often altered in prostate cancer with especially high mutation burden in FOXA1 and FOXP1. FOXA1 harbors loss or gain of function mutations in 8% of prostate cancer, which increases to 14% in metastatic samples. FOXP1 predominately occurs with loss of function mutations in 7% of primary tumors, and similar incidents are found in metastatic samples. Here, we applied in vivo CRISPR editing, to study the loss of functions of these two FOX transcription factors, in murine prostate in combination with loss of Pten. Deficiency of Foxp1 increased proliferation in combination with loss of Pten. In contrast, proliferation was unchanged when androgen was deprived. The expression of Tmprss2 was increased when Foxp1 was mutated in vivo, showing that Foxp1 is a repressor for this androgen-regulated target. Furthermore, analysis of FOXP1 and TMPRSS2 expression in a human prostate cancer data set revealed a negative correlation. Mutation of Foxa1 in the murine prostate induces cell plasticity to luminal cells. Here, epithelial cells with loss of Foxa1 were transdifferentiated to cells with expression of the basal markers Ck5 and p63. Interestingly, these cells were located in the lumen and did not co-express Ck8. Overall, this study reveals that loss of Foxp1 increases cell proliferation, whereas loss of Foxa1 induces epithelial plasticity in prostate cancer.""","""['Huiqiang Cai', 'Simon N Agersnap', 'Amalie Sjøgren', 'Mikkel K Simonsen', 'Mathilde S Blaavand', 'Ulrikke V Jensen', 'Martin K Thomsen']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Integrative analysis of FOXP1 function reveals a tumor-suppressive effect in prostate cancer.', 'Association of double-positive FOXA1 and FOXP1 immunoreactivities with favorable prognosis of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients.', 'FOXA1 knock-out via CRISPR/Cas9 altered Casp-9, Bax, CCND1, CDK4, and fibronectin expressions in LNCaP cells.', 'FOXP1 and estrogen signaling in breast cancer.', 'Pioneer of prostate cancer: past, present and the future of FOXA1.', 'Application of CRISPR for In Vivo Mouse Cancer Studies.']"""

In this study, we investigated the effects of chrysin on tumor progression in hypoxic PC-3 cells. Chrysin exerted a significant inhibitory effect on 3D cell growth under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. It also decreased the hypoxia-induced vasculogenic mimicry and attenuated the expression of HIF-1α and VE-cadherin. Chrysin inhibited HIF-1α accumulation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in hypoxic PC-3 cells, while also suppressing the expression of HIF-1α by inhibiting SPHK-1 in both CoCl2 and hypoxic PC-3 cells. At high concentrations of chrysin, there was a greater increase in apoptosis in the hypoxic cells compared to that in normoxic cells, which was accompanied by sub-G1 phase arrest. Chrysin-induced apoptosis inhibited VEGF and Bcl-2 and induced the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3. SPHK-1 knockdown induced apoptosis and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Consistent with the in vitro data, 50 mg/kg of chrysin suppressed the tumor growth of PC-3 xenografts by 80.4% compared to that in the untreated control group. The immunohistochemistry of tumor tissues revealed decreased Ki-67, HIF-1α, and VEGF expression in the chrysin-treated group compared to an untreated control. Western blotting data for tumor tissues showed that chrysin treatment decreased SPHK-1, HIF-1α, and PARP expression while inducing caspase-3 cleavage. Overall, our findings suggest that chrysin exerts anti-tumor activity by inhibiting SPHK-1/HIF-1α signaling and thus represents a potent chemotherapeutic agent for hypoxia, which promotes cancer progression and is related to poor prognoses in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Hengmin Han', 'Seon-Ok Lee', 'Yinzhu Xu', 'Jung-Eun Kim', 'Hyo-Jeong Lee']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cells""","""['Anti-cancer effect of pristimerin by inhibition of HIF-1α involves the SPHK-1 pathway in hypoxic prostate cancer cells.', 'Sphingosine Kinase-1 Involves the Inhibitory Action of HIF-1α by Chlorogenic Acid in Hypoxic DU145 Cells.', 'Lenticular cytoprotection.

While many members of the developed 4-(4-phenylthiazol-2-yl)morpholine series of AR-DBD inhibitors demonstrated the effective suppression of wild-type AR, a few represented by 4-(4-(3-fluoro-2-methoxyphenyl)thiazol-2-yl)morpholine (VPC14368) exhibited a partial agonistic effect toward the mutated T878A form of the receptor, implying their cross-interaction with the AR ABS. To study the molecular basis of the observed cross-reactivity, we co-crystallized the T878A mutated form of the AR ligand binding domain (LBD) with a bound VPC14368 molecule. Computational modelling revealed that helix 12 of AR undergoes a characteristic shift upon VPC14368 binding causing the agonistic behaviour.

There are no reliable biomarkers for predicting this progression. Chromosomal instability resulting in copy number alterations (CNAs) is characteristically observed in patients with various cancers.  Objective:   To investigate the role of chromosomal instability in patients with mHSPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prospective study analyzed cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in pretreatment plasma samples from 75 patients with elevated prostate-specific antigen. Low-depth whole-genome sequencing of cfDNA was performed to identify CNAs.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The I score (sum of the product of the absolute Z score and the corresponding chromosome length) was used as a measure of chromosomal instability. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazard regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between the I score and time to progression (TTP) and the prognostic value of chromosomal instability in predicting castration resistance, respectively.  Results and limitations:   Of 22 patients with a positive I score, 86.4% (19/22) had metastatic prostate cancer. Of these 19 cases, 94.7% (18/19) were mHSPC, which was high-volume mHSPC in 83.3% (15/18). None of the patients with localized prostate cancer had a positive I score. TTP in patients with mHSPC was significantly shorter in the positive than in the negative I-score group (16.4 vs 36.9 mo; p = 0.001). Only the I score could independently predict mCRPC development (hazard ratio 10.315, 95% confidence interval 1.141-93.208; p = 0.038).

Given these adverse consequences, exploration of time trends and predictors of PSM will improve the patient outcomes following surgery for prostate cancer.  Methods:   Pathological data from RP patients treated from 2011 to 2020 was extracted from the Victorian Prostate Cancer Outcomes Registry. This is a clinical quality registry that regularly benchmarks and reports back to individual clinicians the PSM percentage for their patients. Trends in PSM over time were visualized with separate running mean plots for both pT2 and pT3/4 disease. Predictors of PSM were explored with multivariable regression with date of surgery, surgical method, and hospital type, public or private, entered as covariates.  Results:   In total, 12,394 patients formed the sample with PSM recorded in 25% (n = 3,141) of patients, 12% (777/6,640) in pT2 disease and 41% (2,364/5,754) in pT3/4 disease. Comparing 2011-12 to 2019-20, the pT3/4 PSM proportion declined from 50% to 38% while pT2 percentages were steady at 13%. In ""high volume"" institutions, pT2 PSM fell from 12% to 6.5%. Independent predictors of lower PSM were robotic vs. open method and being treated at a private vs. public institution.

Materials and methods:   We examined 1,102 patients with CaP , having prospectively acquired pedigrees, and analyzed information regarding multiple primary cancers. The prevalence of concordant cancers was assessed with respect to the family history of CaP . First-degree familial CaP was defined as a positive history of CaP in first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, and offspring). Odds ratios for each concordant cancer in men with first-degree familial CaP were estimated. Clinical characteristics were compared between men with and without concordant cancers.  Results:   The prevalence of multiple primary cancers in sporadic PCa was 12.0%, similar to that of first-degree familial CaP (13.5%, P = 0.698). Gastrointestinal cancer was the most common concordant cancer (3.6%), followed by colorectal (2.9%), lung (1.5%), urothelial (1.3%), kidney (1.1%), and other cancers. Colorectal cancer was more frequent in first-degree familial CaP than in sporadic disease (6.8 vs. 2.7%, P = 0.045). However, the rates of other concordant cancers were similar between the 2 groups (P range, 0.242-0.963). Compared with sporadic disease, the age-adjusted odds ratio for concordant colorectal cancer in first-degree familial CaP was 2.930 (95% confidence interval, 1.082-7.929). Patients with concordant colorectal cancer had fewer (2.8 vs. 3.9 cores, P = 0.041) and a lower percentage of (23.5 vs. 33.1%, P = 0.030) positive biopsy cores than CaP only patients.

Objective:   To determine the efficacy of neoadjuvant degarelix plus apalutamide before RP compared with degarelix with a matching placebo.  Design, setting, and participants:   ARNEO was a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II neoadjuvant trial before RP performed between March 2019 and April 2021. Eligible patients had high-risk PCa and were amenable to RP.  Intervention:   Patients were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to degarelix (240-80-80 mg) + apalutamide (240 mg/d) versus degarelix + matching placebo for 3 mo followed by RP. Prior to and following neoadjuvant treatment, pelvic 18F-PSMA-1007 positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was the difference in proportions of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD; = residual cancer burden (RCB) ≤0.25 cm3 at final pathology). Secondary endpoints included differences in prostate-specific antigen responses, pathological staging, and change in TNM stage on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/MRI following hormonal treatment. Biomarkers (immunohistochemical staining on prostate biopsy [PTEN, ERG, Ki67, P53, GR, and PSMA] and PSMA PET/MRI-derived characteristics) associated with pathological response (MRD and RCB) were explored.  Results and limitations:   Patients were randomized to neoadjuvant degarelix + apalutamide (n = 45) or degarelix + matching placebo (n = 44) for 12 wk and underwent RP. Patients in the degarelix + apalutamide arm achieved a significantly higher rate of MRD than those in the control arm (38% vs 9.1%; relative risk [95% confidence interval] = 4.2 [1.5-11], p = 0.002). Patients with PTEN loss in baseline prostate biopsy attained significantly less MRD (11% vs 43%, p = 0.002) and had a higher RCB at final pathology (1.6 vs 0.40 cm3, p < 0.0001) than patients without PTEN loss. Following neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, PSMA PET-estimated tumor volumes (1.2 vs 2.5 ml, p = 0.01) and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax; 4.3 vs 5.7, p = 0.007) were lower in patients with MRD than in patients without MRD. PSMA PET-estimated volume and PSMA PET SUVmax following neoadjuvant treatment correlated significantly with RCB at final pathology (both p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   In high-risk PCa patients, neoadjuvant degarelix plus apalutamide prior to RP results in a significantly improved pathological response (MRD and RCB) compared with degarelix alone. Our trial results provide a solid hypothesis-generating basis for neoadjuvant phase 3 trials, which are powered to detect differences in long-term oncological outcome following neoadjuvant androgen receptor signaling inhibitor therapy.  Patient summary:   In this study, we looked at the difference in pathological responses in high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with degarelix plus apalutamide or degarelix plus matching placebo prior to radical prostatectomy. We demonstrated that patients treated with degarelix plus apalutamide achieved a significantly better tumor response than patients treated with degarelix plus matching placebo.

In addition, it has been shown identification of master metabolic transcriptional regulators (MMTR) of individual metabolic pathways, and how they relate to the disease in question, may offer the key to understanding therapeutic response. In prostate cancer, we have previously demonstrated polyamine biosynthesis and the methionine cycle were targetable metabolic vulnerabilities. However, the MMTRs of these pathways, and how they affect treatment, have yet to be explored. We sought to characterize differential sensitivity of prostate cancer to polyamine- and methionine-targeted therapies by identifying novel MMTRs. We began by developing a gene signature from patient samples, which can predict response to metabolic therapy, and further uncovered a MMTR, JAZF1. We characterized the effects of JAZF1 overexpression on prostate cancer cells, basally and in the context of treatment, by assessing mRNA levels, proliferation, colony formation capability, and key metabolic processes. Lastly, we confirmed the relevance of our findings in large publicly available cohorts of prostate cancer patient samples. We demonstrated differential sensitivity to polyamine and methionine therapies and identified JAZF1 as a MMTR of this response.  Implications:   We have shown JAZF1 can alter sensitivity of cells and its expression can segregate patient populations into those that do, or do not highly express polyamine genes, leading to better prediction of response to a polyamine targeting therapy.""","""['Spencer R Rosario', 'Justine J Jacobi', 'Mark D Long', 'Hayley C Affronti', 'Aryn M Rowsam', 'Dominic J Smiraglia']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Pharmacological polyamine catabolism upregulation with methionine salvage pathway inhibition as an effective prostate cancer therapy.', 'Dysregulation of multiple metabolic networks related to brain transmethylation and polyamine pathways in Alzheimer disease: A targeted metabolomic and transcriptomic study.', 'Metabolic and antiproliferative consequences of activated polyamine catabolism in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells.', 'JAZF1, a relevant metabolic regulator in type 2 diabetes.', 'Polyamines and Cancer.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and its expression increases following prostate cancer progression.  Objective:   In this study, we designed a fusion protein including mutant granzyme B, the influenza virus hemagglutinin HA-2 N-terminal, and PSMA ligand to construct GrB-HA-PSMA ligand fusion protein as a molecular agent for selective targeting of PSMA-positive (LNCaP) cells.  Methods:   The DNA sequence of our designed structure was synthesized and cloned into a pET28a expression vector. The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli origami bacteria and then purified. The expression of the recombinant protein was verified by SDS PAGE and ELISA method. Furthermore, ELISA and flow cytometry assays were utilized to investigate the efficiency of binding and permeability of the recombinant protein into the LNCaP cells. Finally, cell proliferation and apoptosis rate were evaluated by MTT assay and flow cytometry assay, respectively. HeLa and PC3 cell lines were used as controls.  Results:   The results showed that GrB-HA-PSMA ligand fusion protein could specifically bind and internalize into the PSMA-positive cells. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with GrB-HA-PSMA ligand fusion protein resulted in increased apoptotic cell death and decreased proliferation of LNCaP cells.

Methods:   Retrospective data collection for all patients managed by radical cystectomy over the last 3 years for a variant pathol-ogy was completed. We speciﬁcally included micropapillary and nested variants.  Results:   Ten patients were identiﬁed, with eight having micropapillary carcinoma (MPC) and two having nested vari-ants. Nine patients were male. The median age was 75. The two patients with nested variant were 56 and 62 years old, respec-tively, whereas all patients with MPC were over the age of 70.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective single center study included 51 patients with prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosed with MRI-TB and 83 patients diagnosed with TRUS-B between October/2019 and July/2021. We compared the rates of ISUP score upgrading between both groups after robotic-assisted radi-cal prostatectomy (RARP) and the speciﬁc transition of each ISUP score based on biopsy modality. The rate of ISUP score concordance and downgrading were also assessed. To deﬁne the intra and interobserver concordance for each ISUP score in biopsy and RP specimen for each biopsy modality, the Cohen's Kappa coefﬁcient was calculated. ISUP scores and biopsy modal-ity were selected for multivariate analysis and a logistic regres-sion model was built to provide independent risk factors of ISUP score upgrading.  Results:   The difference of the rate of upgrading between MRI-TB group and TRUS-B group was statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.007) with 42.2% of patients of TRUS-B group experiencing an upgrade in their ISUP score while only 19.6% in MRI-TB group. Concordance and downgrading rates did not statistically differ between the two groups. Strength of concordance using Cohen's Kappa coefﬁcient was fair in both groups but higher in MRI-TB group (TRUS-B group k = 0.230; p < 0.001; concordance: 47%vs. MRI/TB group k = 0.438; p < 0.001; concordance: 62.7%).

However, there has been no a comprehensive comparison for the role of these signaling nodes in prostate tumor initiation and progression.  Methods:   With genetically engineered animal models, we compared the impact of prostate-specific deletions of Pten, Tsc1, and Tsc2 and activation of Akt1 on tumor initiation and progression. Also, we assessed the expression and genetic alterations of PTEN, AKT1, TSC1, and TSC2 in human primary prostate cancers.  Results:   For the genetically engineered mice, prostate conditional knockout (cKO) of Pten, Tsc1, and Tsc2 led to initiation and progression of mouse prostatic neoplasia hyperplasia (mPIN). Akt1 transgenic mice developed more aggressive mPINs than mice with Tsc1 or Tsc2 single-cKO, but the effect was more moderate than that for Pten single-cKO or Tsc1/Tsc2 double-cKO mice. Functional analyses showed that Pten single-cKO, AKT1 activation, and Tsc1/Tsc2 double-cKO induced cell proliferation more than Tsc1 or Tsc2 single-cKO, but only Pten single-cKO and AKT1 activation reduced epithelial adhesion. All cKO or AKT1 activation enhanced the phosphorylation of p-S6 (S235/236) but only Pten single-cKO and Tsc1/Tsc2 double-cKO enhanced the phosphorylation of p-AKT (S473) and p-4EBP1 (T37/46/70). In human prostate cancers, PTEN, but not AKT1, TSC1, or TSC2 had frequent genetic alterations. However, as key signaling nodes, AKT1, TSC1, and TSC2 may be responsible for PTEN loss-mediated tumor initiation and progression.

Skeletal-related events can increase the risk of death in patients with PCa by 28%. Due to the low detection rate of lesions in patients with low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels, the value of 99mTc methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) bone scintigraphy is limited. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a small molecular probe that can efficiently and specifically detect PCa lesions. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the difference between 99mTc-PSMA single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT and 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT in the detection of bone metastasis in PCa. A total of 74 men with pathologically confirmed PCa from October 2019 to November 2021 were prospectively enrolled in this study. The median age was 70 (range, 55-87) years. All patients underwent both 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT and 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT at an average interval of 12.1 (range, 1-14) days. The detected imaging-positive bone lesions were scored as ""typical metastasis"" or ""equivocal metastasis"" by a standard reporting schema. Subsequent therapy modality details were observed through follow-up. Twenty-five of the 74 patients were diagnosed with bone metastases. 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT and 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT detected 20 and 18 bone metastases, with sensitivities of 80.0% (20/25) and 72.0% (18/25), specificities of 100.0% (49/49) and 81.3% (40/49), and AUCs of 88.0% and 84.9%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the AUC between the two imaging methods (P < 0.001). In an analysis of the number of bone metastasis lesions, the proportion of ""typical metastasis"" versus ""equivocal metastasis"" detected by the two imaging methods was 26.3:1 (PSMA) and 2.9:1 (MDP), and the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.005). There was a significant difference in the detection of bone metastatic lesions by 99mTc-PSMA and 99mTc-MDP when the maximum diameter of the lesions was ≤ 0.6 cm (P < 0.05). The optimal cut-off value for PSA was 2.635 ng/mL (PSMA) and 15.275 ng/mL (MDP). 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT led to a change in management to a more individualized therapy modality for 11 of 74 men (14.9%). 99mTc-PSMA SPECT/CT was superior to 99mTc-MDP SPECT/CT in the detection of bone metastases in PCa, especially for small lesions and in patients with low PSA levels, and demonstrated an additional benefit of providing information on extraskeletal metastases.

Use of PSA density has been suggested to further risk-stratify these men, to potentially avoid biopsies in favor of monitoring. We evaluate the ability of PSA density (PSAd) to risk-stratify PIRADs 3 lesions across patients who underwent a prostate biopsy in a large multi-institutional collaborative.  Materials and methods:   Pennsylvania Urology Regional Collaborative (PURC) is a voluntary quality improvement collaborative of 11 academic and community urology practices in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. A retrospective analysis was performed on all patients in the PURC database that had a prostate MRI with PI-RADs 3 lesions only. PSA just before the MRI and prostate size reported on MRI were used to calculate the PSA. Clinicopathologic data were evaluated. Univariable analysis using Chi-Square and Kruskal Wallis tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify predictors of any PCa, and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) was defined as ≥ Grade Group 2 (GG2.) RESULTS: Between May 2015 and March 2021, 349 patients with PIRADs 3 lesions only were identified and comprised the cohort of interest. Median PSA was 5.0 with a prostate volume of 58cc and a median PSA density of 0.11, 10.6% of the cohort was African American with 81.4% being Caucasian. Significant prostate cancer was detected in 70/349 (20.0%) men. Smaller prostate volume, abnormal DRE, and higher PSAd were significantly associated with clinically significant prostate cancer on univariable analysis. In men with PSAd <0.15, 31/228 (13.6%) harbored csPCa. Multivariable analysis confirmed that men with PSAd >0.15 were more likely to harbor clinically significant prostate cancer (P < 0.001).  Conclusion:   Across a large regional collaborative, patients with PIRADs 3 lesions on mpMRI were noted to have clinically significant cancer in 20% of biopsies. Using a PSA density cut-off of 0.15 may result in missing clinically significant prostate cancer in 13.6%.

Bioinformatics was applied to analyze LINC01146 expression in PCa and predict target genes of LINC01146, followed by the verification of qRT-PCR, RNA pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). The correlation between LINC01146 expression and clinicopathological characteristics was investigated. The location of LINC01146 in PCa cells was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). After interference with LINC01146 or/and F11 receptor (F11R) or treated with transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1), the function of LINC01146 in PCa in vitro or in vivo was determined by CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, scratch test, transwell assay, xenograft experiment and western blot. LINC01146 and F11R were over-expressed in PCa and positively correlated with poor prognosis. LINC01146 located in the cytoplasm and combined with F11R. LINC01146 overexpression impeded apoptosis, facilitated viability, proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa cells in vitro, promoted tumor growth in vivo, downregulated E-cadherin, Bax and Cleaved caspase-3, and upregulated N-cadherin, Vimentin and PCNA, but LINC01146 silencing did the opposite. F11R was positively regulated by LINC01146 and F11R depletion negated the effect of LINC01146 overexpression on malignant phenotypes of PCa cells. The expression of LINC01146 and F11R was regulated by TGF-β1. The promoting role of TGF-β1 in migration, invasion and F11R in PCa cells was reversed by LINC01146 silencing.

Therefore, the aim of the current study was to assess predictive factors for high FCR in patients undergoing surgery for genitourinary cancer.  Materials and methods:   Overall, 525 patients were prospectively included. FCR was measured using the validated FCR7 questionnaire prior to surgery and after receipt of the histological result. Family support, religiousness, quality-of-life impairment due to FCR, and distress were determined. Patient and tumor-related factors were compared with FCR levels using Mann-Whitney U test or Wilcoxon test. Multivariate analysis was performed by linear/binary regression.  Results:   FCR after receipt of the final histology was significantly lower (median 13, range 6-34) than before surgery (median 15, range 6-36, p < 0.001). In univariate analysis, significant impact on preoperative FCR was observed for gender (p = 0.017), age (p = 0.002), working status (p = 0.038), and education (p = 0.002). High impairment of QoL was associated with higher FCR levels (p < 0.001). Comparing tumor-related factors with FCR, we observed significantly higher FCR scores in patients with nonorgan-confined disease (p = 0.011).  Conclusion:   This study is the first to describe FCR in patients with genitourinary cancers. Surgical treatment improves FCR. Sociodemographic factors like age, female gender, employment, and education were observed to influence FCR levels.

Therefore, therapies targeting CSCs are required. Although previous findings have suggested that non-CSCs regulate the proliferation and differentiation of CSCs in the tumor microenvironment, the precise molecular mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, we found that a direct interaction between CSCs and non-CSCs downregulated CSC division in the PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line. We found that the proliferation of PC-3-derived CSCs (PrSCs) was significantly decreased (∼47%) in the presence of non-CSC-rich parental PC-3 cells compared with that in a culture in which they were absent. We observed no differences in PrSC proliferation when we indirectly cocultured them with PC-3 cells across a Transwell insert, and PrSCs that were transiently bound to immobilized PC-3 cells proliferated more slowly than those bound to PrSCs. The frequency of cell division with prior PrSC-PrSC contact was 2.8 times higher in the PrSC monoculture compared with that in the coculture with PC-3 cells. We found that the PrSCs were approximately 1.3 times more closely associated in the monoculture compared with the coculture with PC-3 cells, as determined by a cell proximity assay. The frequency of asymmetric PrSC division was 6.5% in the monoculture compared with 1.0% in the coculture with PC-3 cells (P &lt; 0.045). By analyzing our data, we determined the importance of PrSC-non-CSC contact in regulating the frequency and mode of PrSC division.

This phenomenon might indicate the potential of cancer lesions to respond to ADT. In this prospective study, we evaluated the flare on [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT after ADT in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa). Given that aggressive PCa tends to display FDG uptake, we particularly investigated whether the changes in PSMA uptake might correlate with glucose metabolism.  Methods:   Twenty-five men with newly diagnosed treatment-naïve metastatic PCa were enrolled in this prospective registered clinical trial. All the patients underwent [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT immediately before and 3-4 weeks after ADT initiation (degarelix). Before ADT, [18F]FDG PET/CT was also performed. Standardized uptake values (SUV)max of primary and metastatic lesions were calculated in all PET scans. Serum PSA and testosterone blood samples were collected before the two PSMA PET scans. The changes in PSMA uptake after ADT were represented as ΔSUVmax.  Results:   All the patients reached castration levels of testosterone at the time of the second [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT. Overall, 57 prostate, 314 lymph nodes (LN), and 406 bone lesions were analyzed. After ADT, 104 (26%) bone, 33 (11%) LN, and 6 (11%) prostate lesions showed an increase (≥ 20%) in PSMA uptake, with a median ΔSUVmax of + 50%, + 60%, and + 45%, respectively. Among the lesions detected at the baseline [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT, 63% bone and 46% LN were FDG-positive. In these metastases, a negative correlation was observed between the PSMA ΔSUVmax and FDG SUVmax (p < 0.0001). Moreover, a negative correlation between the ΔSUVmax and the decrease in serum PSA after ADT was noted (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   A heterogeneous increase in PSMA uptake after ADT was detected, most evidently in bone metastases. We observed a negative correlation between the PSMA flare and the intensity of glucose uptake as well as the decrease of serum PSA, suggesting that lesions presenting with such flare might potentially be less aggressive.

Although PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockades have recently shown promising clinical benefits, the overall response rate remains largely insufficient. Hence, alternative therapeutic approaches are warranted. Given the immunosuppressive properties of CD73-mediated adenosine release, CD73 blocking approaches are emerging as attractive strategies in cancer immunotherapy. Understanding the precise mechanism regulating the expression of CD73 is required to develop effective anti-CD73-based therapy. Our previous observations demonstrate that the transcription factors driving epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT-TF) can regulate the expression of several inhibitory immune checkpoints. Here we analyzed the role of the EMT-TF SNAI1 in the regulation of CD73 in TNBC cells. We found that doxycycline-driven SNAI1 expression in the epithelial -like TNBC cell line MDA-MB-468 results in CD73 upregulation by direct binding to the CD73 proximal promoter. SNAI1-dependent upregulation of CD73 leads to increased production and release of extracellular adenosine by TNBC cells and contributes to the enhancement of TNBC immunosuppressive properties. Our data are validated in TNBC samples by showing a positive correlation between the mRNA expression of CD73 and SNAI1.

Results:   The median overall survival (OS) was 13.8 months (range 0.5-57 months), and the median real-world progression-free survival (rwPFS) was 4.9 months (range 0.5-29.8 months). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values within the normal range before and during the radium-223 treatment or the reduction of elevated ALP to normal range during treatment were associated with better OS when compared to elevated ALP values before and during treatment (p < 0.0001). High prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (≥100 μg/L) before radium-223 treatment was associated with poor OS compared to low PSA level (<20 μg/L) (p = 0.0001). Most patients (57%) experienced pain relief. Pain relief indicated better OS (p = 0.002). Radium-223 treatment was well tolerated. Toxicity was mostly low grade. Only 12.5% of the patients had grade III-IV adverse events, most commonly anemia, neutropenia, leucopenia, and thrombocytopenia.  Conclusion:   Radium-223 was well tolerated in routine clinical practice, and most patients achieved pain relief. Pain relief, ALP normalization, lower baseline PSA, and PSA decrease during radium-223 treatment were prognostic for better survival. The efficacy of radium-223 in mCRPC as estimated using OS was comparable to earlier randomized trial in this retrospective real-world study. Our results support using radium-223 for mCRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases even in the era of new-generation androgen receptor-targeted agents.""","""['Anniina Hyväkkä', 'Okko-Sakari Kääriäinen', 'Tapio Utriainen', 'Eliisa Löyttyniemi', 'Kalle Mattila', 'Petri Reinikainen', 'Jorma Sormunen', 'Minna Jääskeläinen', 'Päivi Auvinen', 'Heikki Minn', 'Maria Sundvall']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Phase II study of radium-223 dichloride in Japanese patients with symptomatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness and safety of radium-223 dichloride in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer and bone metastases in real-world practice: A multi-institutional study.', 'Results From a Large, Multicenter, Retrospective Analysis On Radium223 Use in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) in the Triveneto Italian Region.', 'Treatment outcomes with radium-223 in docetaxel-naïve versus docetaxel-treated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients: Real-world evidence from Taiwan.', 'Radium-223 dichloride: a novel treatment option for castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with symptomatic bone metastases.']"""

Because of their clinical importance, building PSA biosensing systems with high sensitivity and stability is essential. However, it still presents significant difficulties, such as low detection limits. We designed a platform to covalently bind the amino-terminated aptamer by modifying the ITO-PET surface with carboxyethylsilanetriol (CTES) to obtain a self-assembled monolayer (SAM). We also evaluated the potential for use in real human serum samples by investigating the optimal operating conditions and analytical performance characteristics of the developed biosensor. The design we present here exhibits excellent precision, with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 8.74 fg/mL PSA. The broad linear detection range of the biosensor under optimal conditions was determined as 1.0-1500 fg/mL. The dissociation constant (Kd) for the aptamer was also calculated as 46.28 ± 5.63 nM by evaluating the impedimetric response as a function of PSA concentration. The aptasensor displayed considerable repeatability (1.3% RSD) and reproducibility (7.51% RSD) and good storage stability (98.34% of the initial activity for 8 weeks). Additionally, we demonstrated that the technique we developed was quite efficient in estimating the kinetics of aptamer-analyte interactions by determining the Kd and single-frequency impedance (SFI) data. In conclusion, we proposed a selective and sensitive biosensor with the potential for clinical application and superior performance in real serum samples.""","""['Canan Özyurt', 'İnci Uludağ', 'Mustafa Kemal Sezgintürk']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anal Bioanal Chem""","""['An electrochemical aptasensor for detection of prostate-specific antigen using reduced graphene gold nanocomposite and Cu/carbon quantum dots.', 'Fabrication of a novel and ultrasensitive label-free electrochemical aptasensor for detection of biomarker prostate specific antigen.', 'The electrochemical detection of prostate specific antigen on glassy carbon electrode modified with combinations of graphene quantum dots, cobalt phthalocyanine and an aptamer.', 'A Sensitive Aptamer-Based Biosensor for Electrochemical Quantification of PSA as a Specific Diagnostic Marker of Prostate Cancer.', 'Application of various optical and electrochemical aptasensors for detection of human prostate specific antigen: A review.']"""

In addition, in vitro cytotoxicity was tested against six cancer cells: A549 (lung carcinoma); DU-145 (human prostate carcinoma); HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), PC-3 (human prostate adenocarcinoma); MDA-MB-231 (human breast adenocarcinoma); Caco-2 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma), and against two non-cancer cells, FGH (human gingival normal fibroblasts) and PNT-2 (prostate epithelial cells). Complex (1) was slightly more toxic and selective than complex (2) for all cell lines, except against the A549 cells, where (2) was more potent than complex (1). The complexes induced an increase in the reactive oxygen species, and the co-treatment with N-acetyl-L-cysteine remarkably suppressed the ROS generation and prevented the reduction of cell viability, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of the complexes is related to the ROS-mediated pathway. Further studies indicated that the complexes may bind to DNA via minor groove interaction. Our studies also revealed that free Lap induces gene mutations in Salmonella Typhimurium, nevertheless, the complexes demonstrated the absence of genotoxicity by the Ames test.

Objective:   To evaluate whether whole-pelvis radiotherapy (WPRT) improves clinical relapse-free survival (cRFS) in comparison to prostate-only radiotherapy (PORT) in pN1 PCa.  Design, setting, and participants:   PROPER was a phase 3 trial randomizing patients to WPRT or PORT. All patients had pN1cM0 PCa with fewer than five lymph nodes involved.  Intervention:   All patients underwent pelvic lymph node dissection followed by radical prostatectomy/primary radiotherapy + 2 yr of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Patients were randomized to PORT (arm A) or WPRT (arm B).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was cRFS. The secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS), and toxicity. The study was stopped because of poor accrual in June 2021 after the inclusion of 69 patients. We report on OS, bRFS, cRFS, and acute and late toxicity.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 30 mo in arm A (n = 33) and 36 mo in arm B (n = 31). The 3-yr OS rate was 92% ± 5% in arm A and 93% ± 5% in arm B (p = 0.61). None of the patients died of PCa. The 3-yr bRFS was 79% ± 9% in arm A and 92% ± 5% in arm B (p = 0.08). The 3-yr cRFS rate was 88% ± 6% in arm A and 92% ± 5% in arm B (p = 0.31). No pelvic recurrence was observed in arm B. Acute grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity was higher with WPRT (15% in arm A vs 45% in arm B; p = 0.03). Limitations are the early closure because of poor accrual and the limited follow-up.  Conclusions:   The results of our trial are hypothesis-generating but add evidence supporting the recommendation to offer WPRT to patients with pN1 PCa. However, WPRT is associated with more acute gastrointestinal toxicity.  Patient summary:   We looked at the impact of radiotherapy to the whole pelvis (WPRT) for patients with prostate cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes. Although the trial was closed early because of poor enrolment, we found that WPRT improves survival free from relapse, and no recurrences were observed in the pelvis.

Objective:   To assess whether early DVC ligation might affect UC recovery after RARP.  Intervention:   DVC ligation (early vs standard).  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 312 patients with prostate cancer underwent primary RARP at a tertiary care institution.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was UC recovery at 1 and 4 mo after RARP. UC was defined as 0 pads/1 safety pad per day. All patients completed the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and International Consultation of Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-Short Form questionnaires. Secondary outcomes were early (≤4 mo) erectile function recovery, the positive surgical margin (PSM) rate, 30-d Clavien-Dindo complications, and biochemical recurrence rates. Quality of life was assessed using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. The association between treatment arm and UC recovery was also tested using multivariable regression models.  Results and limitations:   After surgery, 23 patients withdrew their consent and 29 were lost to follow-up, leaving 261 patients available for per-protocol analyses. Of these, 32 patients (24%) in the experimental group and 37 (29%) in the control group used no pad/one safety pad at 1 mo after RARP, whereas 96 (72%) in the control group versus 83 (65%) in the control group were continent at 4-mo follow-up (both p = 0.3). Median ICIQ and IPSS scores did not differ between the groups at both time points. The results were confirmed on multivariable regression analyses. PSMs were observed for 32 patients (25%) in the experimental group versus 30 (22%) in the control group (p = 0.6). The incidence of postoperative complications (17% experimental vs 13% control) and the 1-yr biochemical recurrence-free survival did not differ between the groups.  Conclusions:   In this randomized clinical trial, we did not find evidence that early ligation of the DVC during RARP was associated with better UC recovery after surgery in comparison to the standard technique. Given its safety in terms of surgical margins and complications, this technique may be considered as an option for surgical dissection according to the physician's preference.  Patient summary:   Our trial showed that for patients undergoing robot-assisted surgical removal of the prostate, the timing of a specific step to control bleeding from a network of veins draining the prostate did not affect recovery of urinary continence after surgery.

Transperineal template prostate biopsy (TTPB) has emerged as a reliable procedure for the histopathological diagnosis of PCa and BPH due to its higher cancer detection rates. Although antiseptic preparation and antibiotic prophylaxis are used to ensure safety in patients undergoing surgical intervention, post-operative complications, such as infection and bleeding are still unavoidable, resulting in re-admissions, with resource implications. Currently, there is no biomarker profile to predict outcomes or monitor patients during the post-operative course. The main aim of this single-centre observational clinical pilot-study was to investigate the role of inflammatory and infection biomarkers following TTPB and their association with post-operative complications.  Methods:   Forty-five patients scheduled for elective TTPB were recruited after informed consent at the Wrexham Maelor and Glan Clwyd Hospitals, North Wales, UK (n = 45). Prior to surgery, venous blood samples were collected at baseline and subsequently at 30, 120, and 240 min post-operatively. Urine samples were collected before and 120 min after the procedure. Serum procalcitonin (PCT), serum ferritin, and urine B2MG analysis were done using enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) and the magnetic Luminex® multiplex performance assay was used to analyse IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α plasma concentrations. Data on clinical outcomes were collected from patients' medical records.  Results:   Following TTPB, significant (p ≤ 0.05) increases were observed in uB2MG, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α. Significant decreases were observed in ferritin (p ≤ 0.05). No significant change was observed in PCT concentration (p ≥ 0.05). One patient developed an infection and severe haematuria post-operatively following TTPB.  Conclusion:   Although not confirmative, changes seen in biomarkers such as uB2MG, IL-10 and TNF-α in our observational clinical pilot-study may warrant further investigation, involving larger cohorts, to fully understand the role of these biomarkers and their potential association with post-operative complications such as infection and bleeding which can develop following TTPB for the diagnosis of PCa and BPH.""","""['Nana Yaa Frempomaa Snyper', 'Joanne Pike', 'Kingsley Ekwueme', 'Iqbal Shergill', 'Stephen Fôn Hughes']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Med Res""","""['Expression of Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Induced by IFN-γ and TNF-α as Potential Biomarker of Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Complications and quality of life after template-assisted transperineal prostate biopsy in patients eligible for focal therapy.', 'Predictors of erectile dysfunction after transperineal template prostate biopsy.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: Comparative studies including radical prostatectomy specimens and template transperineal biopsy.', 'The controversial relationship between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: the role of inflammation.']"""

Systemic treatment intensification with abiraterone or docetaxel reduces PC-specific mortality (PCSM) and distant metastasis (DM) in men receiving external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Whether prostate-directed treatment intensification with the addition of brachytherapy (BT) boost to EBRT with ADT improves outcomes in this group is unclear.  Methods and materials:   This cohort study from 16 centers across 4 countries included men with VHR PC treated with either dose-escalated EBRT with ≥24 months of ADT or EBRT + BT boost with ≥12 months of ADT. VHR was defined by National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) criteria (clinical T3b-4, primary Gleason pattern 5, or ≥2 NCCN high-risk features), and results were corroborated in a subgroup of men who met Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) trials inclusion criteria (≥2 of the following: clinical T3-4, Gleason 8-10, or PSA ≥40 ng/mL). PCSM and DM between EBRT and EBRT + BT were compared using inverse probability of treatment weight-adjusted Fine-Gray competing risk regression.  Results:   Among the entire cohort, 270 underwent EBRT and 101 EBRT + BT. After a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 6.7% and 5.9% of men died of PC and 16.3% and 9.9% had DM after EBRT and EBRT + BT, respectively. There was no significant difference in PCSM (sHR, 1.47 [95% CI, 0.57-3.75]; P = .42) or DM (sHR, 0.72, [95% CI, 0.30-1.71]; P = .45) between EBRT + BT and EBRT. Results were similar within the STAMPEDE-defined VHR subgroup (PCSM: sHR, 1.67 [95% CI, 0.48-5.81]; P = .42; DM: sHR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.15-2.04]; P = .38).

Nevertheless, in the clinical routine, these sequences are principally analyzed from expert observations, which introduces an intrinsic variability in the diagnosis. Even worse, the isolated study of these MRI sequences trends to false positive detection due to other diseases that share similar radiological findings. Hence, the main objective of this study was to design, propose and validate a deep multimodal learning framework to support MRI-based prostate cancer diagnosis using cross-correlation modules that fuse MRI regions, coded from independent MRI parameter branches.Approach.This work introduces a multimodal scheme that integrates MP-MRI sequences and allows to characterize prostate lesions related to cancer disease. For doing so, potential 3D regions were extracted around expert annotations over different prostate zones. Then, a convolutional representation was obtained from each evaluated sequence, allowing a rich and hierarchical deep representation. Each convolutional branch representation was integrated following a special inception-like module. This module allows a redundant non-linear integration that preserves textural spatial lesion features and could obtain higher levels of representation.Main results.This strategy enhances micro-circulation, morphological, and cellular density features, which thereafter are integrated according to an inception late fusion strategy, leading to a better differentiation of prostate cancer lesions. The proposed strategy achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.82 over the PROSTATEx dataset by fusing regions ofKtransand apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps coded from DWI-MRI.Significance.This study conducted an evaluation about how MP-MRI parameters can be fused, through a deep learning representation, exploiting spatial correlations among multiple lesion observations. The strategy, from a multimodal representation, learns branches representations to exploit radio-logical findings from ADC andKtrans. Besides, the proposed strategy is very compact (151 630 trainable parameters). Hence, the methodology is very fast in training (3 s for an epoch of 320 samples), being potentially applicable in clinical scenarios.""","""['Yesid Gutiérrez', 'John Arevalo', 'Fabio Martínez']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Multimodal Contrastive Supervised Learning to Classify Clinical Significance MRI Regions on Prostate Cancer.', 'Semi-automatic classification of prostate cancer on multi-parametric MR imaging using a multi-channel 3D convolutional neural network.', 'Light Weighted Healthcare CNN Model to Detect Prostate Cancer on Multiparametric MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: Physical Foundations, Limitations, and Prospective Advances of\xa0Diffusion-Weighted MRI.']"""

Inhibitors of MAO modulate the levels of neurotransmitters in the central nervous system, and have been used for several decades for the treatment of depression and Parkinson's disease, while potential new therapeutic applications in other diseases such as prostate cancer and heart failure may exist. In the interest of discovering new classes of chemical compounds that potently inhibit the MAOs, the present study synthesises a series of ten isatoic anhydrides and evaluates their potential as in vitro inhibitors of human MAO-A and MAO-B. The isatoic anhydrides bear structural similarity to a series of 3,4-dihydro-2(1H)-quinolinones as well as to series of isatins and phthalimides that have been reported to act as potent MAO-B inhibitors. The results document that the isatoic anhydrides inhibit both MAO isoforms with the most potent inhibitors exhibiting IC50 values of 0.010 µM (1b and 1h) and 0.0047 µM (1j) for MAO-A and MAO-B, respectively. Molecular docking suggests that isatoic anhydrides exhibit similar binding modes and interactions with MAO-A and MAO-B, which may explain their potent inhibition of both isoforms. It may be concluded that the isatoic anhydrides represent a new class of MAO inhibitors, while it is interesting to note that very few studies on the pharmacological actions of isatoic anhydrides have been reported. As a secondary aim, the isatoic anhydrides were also evaluated as potential inhibitors of d-amino acid oxidase (DAAO), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE).""","""['Rialette Hitge', 'Anél Petzer', 'Jacobus P Petzer']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem""","""['The inhibition of monoamine oxidase by 2H-1,4-benzothiazin-3(4H)-ones.', 'Quinolinic Carboxylic Acid Derivatives as Potential Multi-target Compounds for Neurodegeneration: Monoamine Oxidase and Cholinesterase Inhibition.', 'Coumarin derivatives as inhibitors of d-amino acid oxidase and monoamine oxidase.', ""Repurposing of FDA-approved drugs as dual-acting MAO-B and AChE inhibitors against Alzheimer's disease: An in silico and in vitro study."", 'Review of β-carboline and its derivatives as selective MAO-A inhibitors.']"""

Current clinicopathological measures are imperfect predictors of disease progression. Epigenetic changes are amongst the earliest molecular changes in tumourigenesis. To find new prognostic biomarkers to enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes, we performed methylome sequencing of DNA from patients with localised prostate cancer and long-term clinical follow-up.  Methods:   We used whole-genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS) to comprehensively map and compare DNA methylation of radical prostatectomy tissue between patients with lethal disease (n = 7) and non-lethal (n = 8) disease (median follow-up 19.5 years). Validation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) was performed in an independent cohort (n = 185, median follow-up 15 years) using targeted multiplex bisulphite sequencing of candidate regions. Survival was assessed via univariable and multivariable analyses including clinicopathological measures (log-rank and Cox regression models).  Results:   WGBS data analysis identified cancer-specific methylation patterns including CpG island hypermethylation, and hypomethylation of repetitive elements, with increasing disease risk. We identified 1420 DMRs associated with prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), which showed enrichment for gene sets downregulated in prostate cancer and de novo methylated in cancer. Through comparison with public prostate cancer datasets, we refined the DMRs to develop an 18-gene prognostic panel. Applying this panel to an independent cohort, we found significant associations between PCSM and hypermethylation at EPHB3, PARP6, TBX1, MARCH6 and a regulatory element within CACNA2D4. Strikingly in a multivariable model, inclusion of CACNA2D4 methylation was a better predictor of PCSM versus grade alone (Harrell's C-index: 0.779 vs. 0.684).

Methods:   NEUROS was a 2-arm, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that included 189 patients with rectal cancer who underwent TMEs at 8 centers, from February 2013 to January 2017. TMEs were performed with pIONM (n=90) or without it (control, n=99). The groups were stratified according to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and sex, with blocks of variable length. Data were analyzed according to a modified intention-to-treat protocol. The primary endpoint was a urinary function at 12 months after surgery, assessed with the International Prostate Symptom Score, a patient-reported outcome measure. Deterioration was defined as an increase of at least 5 points from the preoperative score. Secondary endpoints were sexual and anorectal functional outcomes, safety, and TME quality.

RNA modification writers affect the expression of immune checkpoints. Gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses revealed that the RNA modification was related to the cell cycle.

These hematite microrobots can display negative phototactic motion under light irradiation and flexible actuation in a defined path controlled by an external magnetic field. Non-contact transportation of micro-sized cells can be achieved by manipulating the microrobot's motion. In addition, the biocompatible microrobots induce GSH depletion and greatly enhance PDT performance.

Methods:   Between October 2003 and March 2014, our institution treated 1241 patients with intermediate-risk PCa (RP: n = 531; LDR-BT: n = 710). Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels of 0.2 ng/ml or greater for RP, and as PSA nadir plus 2 ng/ml or higher (Phoenix definition) for LDR-BT. We calculated propensity scores by multivariate logistic regression based on covariates that included age, pretreatment PSA, biopsy Gleason grade, the percentage of positive biopsy cores (PPBC), and clinical T stage.  Results:   Median follow-up was 108 months for RP and 99 months for LDR-BT. After propensity score adjustment, a total of 642 (321 each) patients remained for further analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves showed no statistically significant difference in overall survival (OS) (p = 0.99). LDR-BT was associated with improved BCR-free survival and salvage therapy-free survival compared to RP (p < 0.001), and RP was associated with improved metastasis-free survival (MFS, p < 0.001).  Conclusion:   BCR cannot be a surrogate for survival comparison, primarily due to differences between treatment modalities in how this term was defined post-therapy. Long-term follow-up showed that RP was associated with lower MFS in intermediate-risk PCa.

Methods:   Twenty-six localized prostate patients previously treated with VMAT (CTV to PTV expansion of 3-5 mm) were re-planned with RO-IMPT with 3 mm and 5 mm geometrical uncertainties coupled with 3% range uncertainties. Robust evaluations (RE) accounting for the geometrical uncertainties of 3 and 5 mm were evaluated for the IMPT and VMAT plans. Clinical target volume (CTV), anorectum, and bladder dose metrics were analyzed between the nominal plans and their uncertainty perturbations.  Results:   With geometric uncertainties of 5 mm and accounting for potential inter-fractional perturbations, RO-IMPT provided statistically significant (p < 0.05) sparing at intermediate doses (V4000cGy) to the anorectum and bladder and high dose sparring (V8000cGy) to the bladder compared to VMAT. Decreasing the RO and RE parameters to 3 mm improved IMPT sparing over VMAT at all OAR dose levels investigated while maintaining equivalent coverage to the CTV.  Conclusions:   For localized prostate treatments, if geometric uncertainties can be maintained at or below 3 mm, RO-IMPT provides clear dosimetric advantages in anorectum and bladder sparing compared to VMAT. This advantage remains even under uncertainty scenarios. As geometric uncertainties increase to 5 mm, RO-IMPT still provides dosimetric advantages, but to a smaller magnitude.""","""['Michael P Butkus', 'Nellie Brovold', 'Tejan Diwanji', 'Yihang Xu', 'Mariluz De Ornelas', 'Alan Dal Pra', 'Matt Abramowitz', 'Alan Pollack', 'Nesrin Dogan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Treatment planning comparison of IMPT, VMAT and 4π radiotherapy for prostate cases.', 'Assessment of daily dose accumulation for robustly optimized intensity modulated proton therapy treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Impact of setup and range uncertainties on TCP and NTCP following VMAT or IMPT of oropharyngeal cancer patients.', 'PTV-based IMPT optimization incorporating planning risk volumes vs robust optimization.', 'Robust optimization in lung treatment plans accounting for geometric uncertainty.']"""

This report explored exercise motivation in men with prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance participating in a randomized exercise trial.  Methods:   The Exercise during Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer (ERASE) trial randomized 52 men with prostate cancer on active surveillance to the HIIT exercise group or the usual care (UC) group. The exercise program was supervised aerobic HIIT conducted three times per week for 12 weeks. The motivation questions were developed using the Theory of Planned Behavior and included motivational constructs, anticipated and experienced outcomes, and barriers to HIIT during active surveillance.  Results:   The HIIT group attended 96% of the planned exercise sessions with 100% compliance to the exercise protocol. Motivation outcome data were obtained in 25/26 (96%) participants in the HIIT group and 25/26 (96%) participants in the UC group. At baseline, study participants were generally motivated to perform HIIT. After the intervention, the HIIT group reported that HIIT was even more enjoyable (p < 0.001; d = 1.38), more motivating (p = 0.001; d = 0.89), more controllable (p < 0.001; d = 0.85), and instilled more confidence (p = 0.004; d = 0.66) than they had anticipated. Moreover, compared to UC, HIIT participants reported significantly higher perceived control (p = 0.006; d = 0.68) and a more specific plan (p = 0.032; d = 0.67) for performing HIIT over the next 6 months. No significant differences were found in anticipated versus experienced outcomes. Exercise barriers were minimal, however, the most often reported barriers included pain or soreness (56%), traveling to the fitness center (40%), and being too busy and having limited time (36%).  Conclusion:   Men with prostate cancer on active surveillance were largely motivated and expected significant benefits from a supervised HIIT program. Moreover, the men assigned to the HIIT program experienced few barriers and achieved high adherence, which further improved their motivation.

This study integrated bioinformatics and functional analysis to reveal the prognosis and potential functions of TLN1 in AML. The results showed that the expression level of TLN1 was abnormally increased in AML and localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm, and TLN1 is a significant prognostic indicator of overall survival (OS). Enrichment analysis of related genes showed that TLN1 is related to neutrophil mediated immunity, neutrophil activation and may regulate important signal pathways in hematological tumors including tyrosine kinase receptor, FLT3 and PIK3/AKT. The PPI network shows that TLN1 and MYH9 may be involved in the process of AML tumors together with PIP5K1C, ROCK1, S100A4, MY01A and WAC. Immune infiltration analysis explains that TLN1 is associated with multiple immune cells and may be an important immune marker in AML.

Methods:   Our group used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to examine genes regulated by metformin within the C4-2 human prostate cancer cell line. Western blot analysis and quantitative RT-PCR were used to confirm alterations in gene expression and further explore regulation of protein expression by metformin.  Results:   Data from the RNA-seq analysis revealed that metformin alters the expression of genes products involved in metabolic pathways, the spliceosome, RNA transport, and protein processing within the endoplasmic reticulum. Gene products involved in ErbB, insulin, mTOR, TGF-β, MAPK, and Wnt signaling pathways are also regulated by metformin. A subset of metformin-regulated gene products were genes known to be direct transcriptional targets of p53 or AR.

Whilst research has demonstrated the effectiveness of small monetary incentives for encouraging research participation, little research has examined different large unconditional incentive amounts. Larger unconditional incentives may result in increased participation of men in psychological research. This randomised study within a case-control trial of men diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer aimed to investigate whether (a) response rates to a 30-min questionnaire completed via mail, online, or phone would vary with different unconditional incentive amounts, and (b) demographics would vary in those who responded within the different incentive groups.  Methods:   We conducted this randomised study within a case-control cross-sectional study aiming to identify the social-ecological factors influencing treatment discontinuation in prostate cancer patients. A total of 238 participants from the cross-sectional study were randomised to receive one of two unconditional incentives (n = 121 received AUD$10, n = 117 received AUD$20) with the study materials (consent form and survey).  Results:   Overall, 113 (47%) responded; n = 61/121 (50.4%) in the AUD$10 group, and n = 52/117 (44.4%) in the AUD$20 group. No evidence of a difference was found in response rates by incentive group (odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI = 0.76-2.12, p = 0.36). Additionally, there were no evident differences in the demographics of the responders vs. non-responders within each incentive group (all p > 0.05).  Conclusions:   Unlike previous research, we were unable to show that higher monetary incentives were more effective for increasing response rates. An AUD$20 unconditional incentive may be no more effective than a lesser amount for encouraging prostate cancer survivors to participate in research involving long questionnaires. Future research should consider the cost-benefits of providing large unconditional incentives, as non-responses will result in lost resources perhaps better utilised in other engagement strategies.""","""['Megan McIntosh', 'Melissa J Opozda', ""Michael O'Callaghan"", 'Andrew D Vincent', 'Daniel A Galvão', 'Camille E Short']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['No difference in response rate to a mailed survey among prostate cancer survivors using conditional versus unconditional incentives.', ""Effects of a gift certificate incentive and specialized delivery on prostate cancer survivors' response rate to a mailed survey: a randomized-controlled trial."", ""Unconditional and conditional incentives differentially improved general practitioners' participation in an online survey: randomized controlled trial."", ""The effectiveness of recruitment strategies on general practitioner's survey response rates - a systematic review."", 'Strategies to improve retention in randomised trials.']"""

Here we aim to examine whether free-Indocyanine Green (F-ICG) could accurately assess the pathological nodal (pN) status in CaP patients during real-time lymphangiography as a potential replacement for ePLND.  Materials and methods:   219 consecutive patients undergoing F-ICG-guided PLND, ePLND and radical prostatectomy (RP) for clinical-localized CaPwere included in this prospective single-center study. The pathological outcomes of F-ICG-guided PLND were compared to confirmatory ePLND. Parameters of a binary diagnostic test for the proper classification of the pN status of patients ('per-patient' analysis) and for the probability of detecting all the metastatic LNs ('per-node' analysis) were calculated. Outcome measures were prevalence, accuracy (Acc), sensitivity (Se), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratio of a negative F-ICG-guided PLND test result [LR(-)].  Results:   F-ICG-guided PLND successfully visualized LNs in all procedures with no adverse events. The overall per-patient F-ICG staging Acc was 97.7%, Se was 91.4%, with a NPV of 97.0%, and LR(-) of 8.6%. At the overall per-node level, 4,780 LNs were removed and 1,535 (32.1%) were fluorescent in vivo. F-ICG-guided PLND identified LNMs with a Se of 63.4%.

The synthesized compound SP1 exhibited potent growth inhibitory efficacy against four types of human cancer (breast, prostate, colon and lung) cell lines with IC50 = 2.4, 3.4, 7.24 and 7.81 µM and selectivity index 5.79, 4.08, 1.93 and 1.78 respectively. Flow cytometric analysis illustrated that SP1 exhibited high apoptotic effect on all tested cancer cell lines (38.22-52.3 %). The mode of action of this promising compound was declared by its ability to upregulate the gene expression of p21 (2.29-3.91 folds) with suppressing cyclin D (1.9-8.93 folds) and NF-κB (1.26-1.44 fold) in the treated cancer cells. Also, it enhanced the protein expression of apoptotic marker p53 and moderate binding affinity for MDM2 (KD;7.94 μM). Notwithstanding these promising impressive findings, its selectivity against cancer cell lines and safety on normal cells were improved by nanoformulation. Therefore, SP1 was formulated as ultra-flexible niosomal nanovesicles (transethoniosomes). The ultra-deformability is attributable to the synergism between ethanol and edge activators in improving the flexibility of the nanovesicular membrane. F8 exhibited high deformability index (DI) of (23.48 ± 1.4). It was found that % SP1 released from the optimized transethoniosomal formula (F8) after 12 h (Q12h) was 84.17 ± 1.29 % and its entrapment efficiency (%EE) was 76.48 ± 1.44 %. Based upon the very encouraging and promising in vitro results, an in vivo study was carried out in female Balb/c mice weighing (15-25 g). SP1 did halt the proliferation of breast cancer cells as well as suppressed the metastasis in other organs like liver, lung and heart.""","""['Assem Barakat', 'Saeed Alshahrani', 'Abdullah Mohammed Al-Majid', 'Abdullah Saleh Alamary', 'Matti Haukka', 'Marwa M Abu-Serie', 'Alexander Dömling', 'Eman A Mazyed', 'Farid A Badria', 'Fardous F El-Senduny']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Thieno2,3-dpyrimidin-4(3H)-one Derivatives of Benzimidazole as Potential Anti- Breast Cancer (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7) Agents.', 'Stereoselective Synthesis of the Di-Spirooxindole Analogs Based Oxindole and Cyclohexanone Moieties as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Novel benzimidazole-triazole hybrids as apoptosis inducing agents in lung cancer: Design, synthesis, 18F-radiolabeling & galectin-1 inhibition studies.', 'Molecular hybridization design and synthesis of novel spirooxindole-based MDM2 inhibitors endowed with BCL2 signaling attenuation; a step towards the next generation p53 activators.', 'Novel benzothiazole-based dual VEGFR-2/EGFR inhibitors targeting breast and liver cancers: Synthesis, cytotoxic activity, QSAR and molecular docking studies.']"""

Piperazinomethyl-androsterone sulfonamide derivatives were developed as 17β-HSD3 inhibitors and the concentration of a representative sulfonamide derivative (compound 1) was found to accumulate in prostate tumor tissues relatively to plasma in a mouse xenograft experiment. This finding gives us the opportunity to specifically target the prostate cancer tumors through the development of a radiolabelled version of compound 1 toward targeted molecular radiotherapy or radioimaging diagnosis. The chemical synthesis of fluorinated and iodinated analogs of compound 1 was achieved, leading to a series of compounds with similar levels of inhibition as the initial candidate. From 17β-HSD3 inhibition activity, molecular modeling and mouse plasma-concentration studies, the most promising compound of this series was selected, its 18F-radiolabelled version (18F-3) synthesized, and imaging/biodistribution studies engaged.

A major concern about the OCM regarded inclusion of high-cost cancer therapies, which could potentially disincentivize oncologists from prescribing novel therapies.  Objective:   To examine whether oncologist participation in the OCM changed the likelihood that patients received novel therapies vs alternative treatments.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data and Medicare claims compared patient receipt of novel therapies for patients treated by oncologists participating vs not participating in the OCM in the period before (January 2015-June 2016) and after (July 2016-December 2018) OCM initiation. Participants included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in SEER registries who were eligible to receive 1 of 10 novel cancer therapies that received US Food and Drug Administration approval in the 18 months before implementation of the OCM. The study excluded the Hawaii registry because complete data were not available at the time of the data request. Patients in the OCM vs non-OCM groups were matched on novel therapy cohort, outcome time period, and oncologist specialist status. Analysis was conducted between July 2021 and April 2022.  Exposures:   Oncologist participation in the OCM.  Main outcomes and measures:   Preplanned analyses evaluated patient receipt of 1 of 10 novel therapies vs alternative therapies specific to the patient's cancer for the overall study sample and for racial subgroups.  Results:   The study included 2839 matched patients (760 in the OCM group and 2079 in the non-OCM group; median [IQR] age, 72.7 [68.3-77.6] years; 1591 women [56.0%]). Among patients in the non-OCM group, 33.2% received novel therapies before and 40.1% received novel therapies after the start of the OCM vs 39.9% and 50.3% of patients in the OCM group (adjusted difference-in-differences, 3.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -3.7 to 10.7 percentage points; P = .34). In subgroup analyses, second-line immunotherapy use in lung cancer was greater among patients in the OCM group vs non-OCM group (adjusted difference-in-differences, 17.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 4.8-30.0 percentage points; P = .007), but no differences were seen in other subgroups. Over the entire study period, patients with oncologists participating in the OCM were more likely to receive novel therapies than those with oncologists who were not participating (odds ratio, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.09-1.97; P = .01).  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that participation in the OCM was not associated with oncologists' prescribing novel therapies to Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.

Objective:   To document toxic effects of treatment with SABR in a large cohort from a population-based, provincial cancer program.  Design, setting, and participants:   From November 2016 to July 2020, 381 patients across all 6 cancer centers in British Columbia were treated in this single-arm, phase 2 trial of treatment with SABR for patients with oligometastatic or oligoprogressive disease. During this period, patients were only eligible to receive treatment with SABR in these settings in trials within British Columbia; therefore, this analysis is population based, with resultant minimal selection bias compared with previously published SABR series.  Interventions:   Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy to up to 5 metastases.  Main outcomes and measures:   Rate of grade 2, 3, 4, and 5 toxic effects associated with SABR.  Findings:   Among 381 participants (122 women [32%]), the mean (SD; range) age was 68 (11.1; 30-97) years, and the median (range) follow-up was 25 (1-54) months. The most common histological findings were prostate cancer (123 [32%]), colorectal cancer (63 [17%]), breast cancer (42 [11%]), and lung cancer (33 [9%]). The number of SABR-treated sites were 1 (263 [69%]), 2 (82 [22%]), and 3 or more (36 [10%]). The most common sites of SABR were lung (188 [34%]), nonspine bone (136 [25%]), spine (85 [16%]), lymph nodes (78 [14%]), liver (29 [5%]), and adrenal (15 [3%]). Rates of grade 2, 3, 4, and 5 toxic effects associated with SABR (based on the highest-grade toxic effect per patient) were 14.2%; (95% CI, 10.7%-17.7%), 4.2% (95% CI, 2.2%-6.2%), 0%, and 0.3% (95% CI, 0%-0.8%), respectively.

Conclusions and relevance:   This single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial found that the incidence of grade 3 or higher SABR toxic effects in this population-based study was less than 5%. Furthermore, the rates of grade 2 or higher toxic effects (18.6%) were lower than previously published for SABR-COMET (29%).

To test if cell subtypes contributing to progression can be assessed noninvasively, we investigated whether 14 genes representing luminal, neuroendocrine, and stem cells are detectable in whole blood RNA of patients with advanced PCa. For each gene, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were first validated using RNA from PCa cell lines, and their traceability in blood was assessed in cell spiking experiments. These were next tested in blood RNA of 40 advanced PCa cases and 40 healthy controls. Expression in controls, which was low or negative, was used to define stringent thresholds for gene overexpression in patients to account for normal variation in white blood cells. Thirty-five of 40 patients overexpressed at least one gene. Patients with more genes overexpressed had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio 1.42, range 1.12-1.77). Progression on androgen receptor inhibitors was associated with overexpression of stem (odds ratio [OR] 7.74, range 1.68-35.61) and neuroendocrine (OR 13.10, range 1.24-142.34) genes, while luminal genes were associated with taxanes (OR 2.7, range 1.07-6.82). Analyses in PCa transcriptomic datasets revealed that this gene panel was most prominent in metastases of advanced disease, with diversity among patients. Collectively, these findings support the contribution of the prostate cell subtypes to disease progression.

Methods:   Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, the overall and cancer-specific mortality rates were compared among men ≤ 55 years of age diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer that either had radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, or no known treatment.  Results:   Of the 62,772 men diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer between 1975 and 2016, about 60%, 20% and 20% of men underwent radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, and no known treatment, respectively.

This work aims to develop an automated segmentation method for the prostate and its surrounding organs-at-risk in pelvic computed tomography to facilitate prostate radiation treatment planning.Approach. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning algorithm combining a U-shaped convolutional neural network (CNN) and vision transformer (VIT) for multi-organ (i.e. bladder, prostate, rectum, left and right femoral heads) segmentation in male pelvic CT images. The U-shaped model consists of three components: a CNN-based encoder for local feature extraction, a token-based VIT for capturing global dependencies from the CNN features, and a CNN-based decoder for predicting the segmentation outcome from the VIT's output. The novelty of our network is a token-based multi-head self-attention mechanism used in the transformer, which encourages long-range dependencies and forwards informative high-resolution feature maps from the encoder to the decoder. In addition, a knowledge distillation strategy is deployed to further enhance the learning capability of the proposed network.Main results. We evaluated the network using: (1) a dataset collected from 94 patients with prostate cancer; (2) and a public dataset CT-ORG. A quantitative evaluation of the proposed network's performance was performed on each organ based on (1) volume similarity between the segmented contours and ground truth using Dice score, segmentation sensitivity, and precision, (2) surface similarity evaluated by Hausdorff distance (HD), mean surface distance (MSD) and residual mean square distance (RMS), (3) and percentage volume difference (PVD). The performance was then compared against other state-of-art methods. Average volume similarity measures obtained by the network overall organs were Dice score = 0.91, sensitivity = 0.90, precision = 0.92, average surface similarities were HD = 3.78 mm, MSD = 1.24 mm, RMS = 2.03 mm; average percentage volume difference was PVD = 9.9% on the first dataset. The network also obtained Dice score = 0.93, sensitivity = 0.93, precision = 0.93, average surface similarities were HD = 5.82 mm, MSD = 1.16 mm, RMS = 1.24 mm; average percentage volume difference was PVD = 6.6% on the CT-ORG dataset.Significance.

We demonstrate that FOXA1 binds to the regulatory regions of splicing-related genes, including HNRNPK and SRSF1. By controlling trans-acting factor expression, FOXA1 exploits an ""exon definition"" mechanism calibrating alternative splicing toward dominant isoform production. This regulation especially impacts splicing factors themselves and leads to a reduction of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD)-targeted isoforms. Inclusion of the NMD-determinant FLNA exon 30 by FOXA1-controlled oncogene SRSF1 promotes cell growth in vitro and predicts disease recurrence.

In the TME, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a key role in tumour progression, however the mechanisms underpinning fibroblast-cancer cell interactions are incompletely resolved. Here, we address this by applying cell type-specific labelling with amino acid precursors (CTAP) and mass spectrometry (MS)-based (phospho)proteomics to prostate cancer for the first time.  Methods:   Reciprocal interactions between PC3 prostate cancer cells co-cultured with WPMY-1 prostatic fibroblasts were characterised using CTAP-MS. Signalling network changes were determined using Metascape and Enrichr and visualised using Cytoscape. Thymosin β4 (TMSB4X) overexpression was achieved via retroviral transduction and assayed by ELISA. Cell motility was determined using Transwell and random cell migration assays and expression of CAF markers by indirect immunofluorescence.  Results:   WPMY-1 cells co-cultured with PC3s demonstrated a CAF-like phenotype, characterised by enhanced PDGFRB expression and alterations in signalling pathways regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cytoskeletal organisation and cell polarisation. In contrast, co-cultured PC3 cells exhibited more modest network changes, with alterations in mTORC1 signalling and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. The expression of the actin binding protein TMSB4X was significantly decreased in co-cultured WPMY-1 fibroblasts, and overexpression of TMSB4X in fibroblasts decreased migration of co-cultured PC3 cells, reduced fibroblast motility, and protected the fibroblasts from being educated to a CAF-like phenotype by prostate cancer cells.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and the next-generation androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibitors have acquired great success in treating PCa. However, patients treated with ADT or AR targeted therapy are inevitably developing into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) or becoming drug resistance. The role of mRNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification in cancers is largely unknown. This study aimed to explore the role of the m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 in Prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   The expression of NSUN2 and its clinicopathological impact were evaluated in PCa cohorts. The effect of NSUN2 on the biological characteristics of PCa cells was investigated on the basis of gain-offunction and loss-of-function analyses. Subcutaneous models further uncovered the role of NSUN2 in tumor growth. Epi-transcriptome assays with RNA bisulfite sequencing (RNA-BisSeq) analysis and in vitro enzyme reaction assays were performed to validate the targeted effect of NSUN2 on AR. AR-binding sites in the NSUN2 promoter were investigated by ChIP and luciferase assays to uncover the interplay between NSUN2 and AR signaling. RIP-qPCR and EMSA methods were performed to confirm that YBX1 binds to AR m5 C sites.  Results:   NSUN2 is highly expressed in PCa and predicts poor outcome. NSUN2 plays roles as a PCa oncogene both in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of NSUN2 results in decreased expression and activities of AR, including AR-V7. Mechanistically, NSUN2 posttranscriptionally stabilized AR by cluster m5 C modification in a m5CYBX1-dependent manner. Strikingly, treatment with enzalutamide, an effective AR inhibitor, reduces NSUN2 expression and decreases the m5C modification level in prostate cancer cells. Finally, we found that AR transcriptionally regulates NSUN2.  Conclusion:   NSUN2 stabilizes AR mRNA through cluster 5-methylcytosine modification and activates a positive feedback loop to promote prostate cancer.""","""['Wenkai Zhu', 'Fangning Wan', 'Wenhao Xu', 'Zheng Liu', 'Junjie Wang', 'Hena Zhang', 'Shenglin Huang', 'Dingwei Ye']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Clin Transl Med""","""['Targeting the KIF4A/AR Axis to Reverse Endocrine Therapy Resistance in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Niclosamide inhibits androgen receptor variants expression and overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Preclinical Study using Malat1 Small Interfering RNA or Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 Degradation Enhancer ASC-J9® to Suppress Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer Progression.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Vital roles of m5C RNA modification in cancer and immune cell biology.']"""

Methods and results:   Our study was conducted at Mount Sinai hospital at Urology department in New York City from January 2020 to April 2021. Total 129 men performed select MDx test. Indications for prostate biopsy were high-risk Select MDx score, suspicious DRE, PI-RADS scores 3/4/5 on mpMRI, or any combination of these. Fifty-one percentage of 129 patients underwent systemic or combined systemic and MRI/US (ultrasound) fusion biopsy; All men underwent 3 T MRI of Prostate w/wo contrast using standard protocols prior to biopsy. A single surgeon performed prostate biopsies. Gleason score ≥3 + 3 on biopsy is defined as outcome. Descriptive statistics were calculated as cross tables. Binary logistic regression model is used to determine the outcome. The nomogram was based on the coefficients of the logit function. ROCs were plotted and decision curve analysis was performed. Using both high-risk Select MDx and PI-RADS scores of 4/5, 87% of biopsies could have been avoided, while detecting 64% of PCa and missing 36%. If biopsies were performed on men with positive Select MDx or PI-RADS 4/5 results, 16% of biopsies could have been avoided while detecting all PCa. Combining these scores improved specificity and accuracy for the detection of PCa over either used alone.

Results: PSMA binding affinities (Ki) of Ga-HTK03161, Ga-HTK03149, Ga-HTK03189A and Lu-HTK03149 were 3.88±0.66, 6.99±0.80, 550±35.7 and 1.57±0.42 nM, respectively. PET imaging showed that all 68Ga-labeled HTK03161, HTK03149 and HTK03189A/B were excreted mainly via the renal pathway and had minimal uptake in all organs/tissues including kidneys and salivary glands. Tumor xenografts were clearly visualized in PET images of [68Ga]Ga-HTK03161 and [68Ga]Ga-HTK03149 but were barely visualized using [68Ga]Ga-HTK03189A/B.

Longitudinal SPECT imaging studies showed that [177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 was excreted mainly through the renal pathway with high uptake in LNCaP tumors and minimal uptake in all normal organs/tissues. The tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 peaked at 4h post-injection (20.9±2.99 %IA/g) and the uptake was sustained over time. Compared to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, [177Lu]Lu-HTK03149 had 145% increase in tumor absorbed dose but 70% less in kidney absorbed dose, leading to an 7.1-fold increase in tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio.

This study aimed to compare dose mapping (DM) versus Monte Carlo recalculation (MCR), using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images when utilised in automated ART dose accumulation workflows in the MIM Maestro software package.  Methods:   The treatment plans for 38 cancer patients (19 prostate and 19 head and neck cases) were used to perform DM or MCR retrospectively upon CBCTs acquired during treatment, which were then deformably registered to the planning CT (DR-pCT) to facilitate dose accumulation. Dose-volume and region-of-interest data were extracted for the planning target volumes and organs at risk. Intraclass correlation (ICC) values and Bland-Altman plots were utilised to compare DM versus MCR doses on the CBCT images as well as CBCT versus DR-pCT doses.  Results:   When comparing DM and MCR on CBCTs, the differences across dose level mean dose differences were mostly within a ±5% level of agreement based on the Bland-Altman plots, with over 67% of ICC values over 0.9 and indicative of good correlation. When these distributions were deformed back to the planning CT, the agreement was reduced considerably, with larger differences (exceeding ±5%) resulting from workflow-related issues.  Conclusion:   The results emphasise the need to consider and make adaptations to minimise the effect of workflows on algorithm performance. Manual user intervention, refined departmental protocols and further developments to the MIM Maestro software will enhance the use of this tool.""","""['Amelia Brink', 'Kate Stewart', 'Catriona Hargrave']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Med Radiat Sci""","""['Investigating CT to CBCT image registration for head and neck proton therapy as a tool for daily dose recalculation.', 'Dosimetric study on learning-based cone-beam CT correction in adaptive radiation therapy.', 'Automated replication of cone beam CT-guided treatments in the Pinnacle(3) treatment planning system for adaptive radiotherapy.', '""Dose of the day"" based on cone beam computed tomography and deformable image registration for lung cancer radiotherapy.', 'Validation of a deformable image registration technique for cone beam CT-based dose verification.']"""

In this study, DNA-independent action mechanisms of trabectedin are investigated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells. Cell viability was assessed via XTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated via flow cytometry. Tetramethylrodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) dye was utilized to determine mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Cell cycle distribution was investigated via flow cytometric analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were monitored using fluorescence CM-H2DCFDA dye. Changes in CHOP, p-eIF2α, GRP78 and p-PERK which are endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-involved proteins were investigated via western blot. Trabectedin induced cytotoxicity and cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Trabectedin decreased MMP via ROS generation in PCa cells. ER stress-related proteins CHOP, p-eIF2α, GRP78 and p-PERK were also elevated by trabectedin treatment indicating the induction of ER stress-induced apoptosis. The results of this study show that trabectedin may be an effective chemotherapeutic for PCa.""","""['Harika Atmaca', 'Ferdi Oğuz', 'Suleyman Ilhan']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Andrologia""","""['Corosolic acid, a natural triterpenoid, induces ER stress-dependent apoptosis in human castration resistant prostate cancer cells via activation of IRE-1/JNK, PERK/CHOP and TRIB3.', 'Enhanced G2/M Arrest, Caspase Related Apoptosis and Reduced E-Cadherin Dependent Intercellular Adhesion by Trabectedin in Prostate Cancer Stem Cells.', '16-O-caffeoyl-16-hydroxylhexadecanoic acid, a medicinal plant-derived phenylpropanoid, induces apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma cells through ROS-dependent endoplasmic reticulum stress.', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Plays a Key Role in Rotenone-Induced Apoptotic Death of Neurons.', 'Protodioscin Induces Apoptosis Through ROS-Mediated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress via the JNK/p38 Activation Pathways in Human Cervical Cancer Cells.']"""

Multi-shot EPI (msEPI) overcomes the drawbacks of ssEPI DWI. The aim of this article was to compare the image quality and diagnostic performance for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPC) between ssEPI DWI and msEPI DWI. This retrospective study included 134 patients with suspected PC who underwent 3.0 T MRI and subsequent MRI-guided biopsy. Three radiologists independently assessed anatomical distortion, prostate edge clarity, and lesion conspicuity score for pathologically confirmed csPC. Lesion apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and benign ADC were also calculated. In 17 PC patients who underwent prostatectomy, three radiologists independently assessed eight prostate regions by DWI score in PI-RADS v 2.1. Anatomical distortion and prostate edge clarity were significantly higher in msEPI DWI than in ssEPI DWI in the three readers. Lesion conspicuity score was significantly higher in msEPI DWI than in ssEPI DWI in reader 1 and reader 3. Regarding discrimination ability between PC with GS ≤ 3 + 4 and PC with GS ≥ 4 + 3 using lesion ADC, AUC was comparable between ssEPI DWI and msEPI DWI. For diagnostic performance of csPC using DWI score, AUC was comparable between msEPI DWI and ssEPI DWI in all readers. Compared with ssEPI DWI, msEPI DWI had improved image quality and similar or higher diagnostic performance.""","""['Tsutomu Tamada', 'Ayumu Kido', 'Yu Ueda', 'Mitsuru Takeuchi', 'Akihiko Kanki', 'Jaladhar Neelavalli', 'Akira Yamamoto']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Reduced field-of-view and multi-shot DWI acquisition techniques: Prospective evaluation of image quality and distortion reduction in prostate cancer imaging.', 'Applicability of readout-segmented echoplanar diffusion weighted imaging for prostate MRI.', 'Comparison of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging in the Human Brain Using Readout-Segmented EPI and PROPELLER Turbo Spin Echo With Single-Shot EPI at 7 T MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Diffusion-weighted imaging in prostate cancer.', 'Accelerating High b-Value Diffusion-Weighted MRI Using a Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN-DWI).']"""
