Patients and methods:   Forty-nine patients with primary high-risk PCa completed the whole-pelvis radiotherapy plan based on PSMA PET/MRI and MRI. The primary endpoint compared the size and overlap of clinical target volume (CTV) and nodal gross tumour volume (GTVn) based on PSMA PET/MRI and MRI. The diagnostic performance of two methods for pelvic lymph node metastasis (PLNM) was evaluated.  Results:   In the radiotherapy planning for high-risk PCa patients, there was a significant correlation between MRI-CTV and PET/MRI-CTV (P = 0.005), as well as between MRI-GTVn and PET/MRI-GTVn (P < 0.001). There are non-significant differences in the CTV and GTVn based on MRI and PET/MRI images (P = 0.660, P = 0.650, respectively). The conformity index (CI), lesion coverage factor (LCF) and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of CTVs were 0.999, 0.953 and 0.954. The CI, LCF and DSC of GTVns were 0.927, 0.284, and 0.32. Based on pathological lymph node analysis of 463 lymph nodes from 37 patients, the sensitivity, specificity of PET/MRI in the diagnosis of PLNM were 77.78% and 99.76%, respectively, which were higher than those of MRI (P = 0.011). Eight high-risk PCa patients who finished PSMA PET/MRI changed their N or M stage.  Conclusion:   The CTV delineated based on PET/MRI and MRI differ little. The GTVn delineated based on PET/MRI encompasses metastatic pelvic lymph nodes more accurately than MRI and avoids covering pelvic lymph nodes without metastasis. We emphasize the utility of PET/MRI fusion images in GTVn delineation in whole pelvic radiotherapy for PCa. The use of PSMA PET/MRI aids in the realization of more individual and precise radiotherapy for PCa.""","""['Lin-Lin Liu#', 'Lei-Lei Zhu#', 'Zhen-Guo Lu', 'Jun-Die Sun', 'Jun Zhao', 'Hai-Feng Wang', 'Zuo-Lin Xiang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Imaging""","""['Comparison of 68\u202fGa-PSMA ligand PET/CT versus conventional cross-sectional imaging for target volume delineation for metastasis-directed radiotherapy for metachronous lymph node metastases from prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Gross tumor volume delineation in primary prostate cancer on 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/MRI and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

We verified whether the expression of genes encoding for PSMA and enzymes regulating FDG cellular uptake are independent and additive prognosticators in PCa.  Methods:   mRNA expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and PSMA regulation obtained from primary PCa specimens were retrieved from open-source databases and analyzed using an integrative bioinformatics approach. Machine Learning (ML) techniques were used to create predictive Progression-Free Survival (PFS) models. Cellular models of primary PCa with different aggressiveness were used to compare [18F]F-PSMA-1007 and [18F]F-FDG uptake kinetics in vitro. Confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence staining, and quantification analyses were performed to assess the intracellular and cellular membrane PSMA expression.  Results:   ML analyses identified a predictive functional network involving four glucose metabolism-related genes: ALDOB, CTH, PARP2, and SLC2A4. By contrast, FOLH1 expression (encoding for PSMA) did not provide any additive predictive value to the model. At a cellular level, the increase in proliferation rate and migratory potential by primary PCa cells was associated with enhanced FDG uptake and decreased PSMA retention (paralleled by the preferential intracellular localization).  Conclusions:   The overexpression of a functional network involving four glucose metabolism-related genes identifies a higher risk of disease progression since the earliest phases of PCa, in agreement with the acknowledged prognostic value of FDG PET imaging. By contrast, the prognostic value of PSMA PET imaging is independent of the expression of its encoding gene FOLH1. Instead, it is influenced by the protein docking to the cell membrane, regulating its accessibility to tracer binding.""","""['Matteo Bauckneht', 'Cecilia Marini', 'Vanessa Cossu', 'Cristina Campi', 'Mattia Riondato', 'Silvia Bruno', 'Anna Maria Orengo', 'Francesca Vitale', 'Sonia Carta', 'Silvia Chiola', 'Sabrina Chiesa', 'Alberto Miceli', ""Francesca D'Amico"", 'Giuseppe Fornarini', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Michele Piana', 'Silvia Morbelli', 'Alessio Signori', 'Paola Barboro', 'Gianmario Sambuceti']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Increased Prostate Cancer Glucose Metabolism Detected by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography in Localised Gleason 8-10 Prostate Cancers Identifies Very High-risk Patients for Early Recurrence and Resistance to Castration.', 'Flare on 18FPSMA-1007 PET/CT after short-term androgen deprivation therapy and its correlation to FDG uptake: possible marker of tumor aggressiveness in treatment-naïve metastatic prostate cancer patients.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

The purpose of this meta-analysis is to quantify the effect of pretreatment SII on survival outcomes in patients with PCa.  Methods:   The following databases were searched: Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). For exploration of the SII's correlations with the overall survival (OS) and the progression-free survival/biochemical recurrence-free survival (PFS/bRFS) in PCa, the pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were assessed within 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  Results:   The present meta-analysis covered 10 studies with 8133 patients. Among the PCa population, a high SII was linked significantly to poor OS (HR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.87-3.70, p < 0.001), and worse PFS/bRFS (HR = 2.49, 95% CI = 1.30-4.77, p = 0.006). However, a high SII was not linked significantly to T stage (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.86-3.33, p = 0.128), the metastasis to lymph node (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 0.69-4.16, p = 0.251), age (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 0.88-2.23, p = 0.150), or the Gleason score (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 0.88-1.96, p = 0.178).

Unnecessary treatments from overdiagnosis are a significant concern, particularly low-grade disease. Active surveillance has being considered as a risk management strategy to avoid potential side effects by unnecessary radical treatment. In 2016, American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) endorsed the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Clinical Practice Guideline on active surveillance for the management of localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   Based on this guideline, we developed a deep learning model to classify prostate adenocarcinoma into indolent (applicable for active surveillance) and aggressive (necessary for definitive therapy) on core needle biopsy whole slide images (WSIs). In this study, we trained deep learning models using a combination of transfer, weakly supervised, and fully supervised learning approaches using a dataset of core needle biopsy WSIs (n=1300). In addition, we performed an inter-rater reliability evaluation on the WSI classification.  Results:   We evaluated the models on a test set (n=645), achieving ROC-AUCs of 0.846 for indolent and 0.980 for aggressive. The inter-rater reliability evaluation showed s-scores in the range of 0.10 to 0.95, with the lowest being on the WSIs with both indolent and aggressive classification by the model, and the highest on benign WSIs.

Accordingly, specificity at the controlled sensitivity, or vice versa, is a clinically sensible performance metric for evaluating continuous biomarkers. Meanwhile, the performance of a biomarker may vary across sub-populations as defined by covariates, and covariate-specific evaluation can be informative. In this article, we develop a novel modeling and estimation method for covariate-specific specificity at a controlled sensitivity level. Unlike existing methods which typically adopt elaborate models of covariate effects over the entire biomarker distribution, our approach models covariate effects locally at a specific sensitivity level of interest. We also extend our proposed model to handle the whole continuum of sensitivities via dynamic regression and derive covariate-specific ROC curves. We provide the variance estimation through bootstrapping. The asymptotic properties are established. We conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods in comparison with existing methods, and further illustrate the applications in two clinical studies for aggressive prostate cancer.""","""['Ziyi Li', 'Yijian Huang', 'Dattatraya Patil', 'Mark Rubin', 'Martin G Sanda']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Stat Med""","""['Covariate adjustment in continuous biomarker assessment.', 'Bayesian semiparametric estimation of covariate-dependent ROC curves.', 'Combining biomarkers for classification with covariate adjustment.', 'Interval estimation for operating characteristic of continuous biomarkers with controlled sensitivity or specificity.', 'Nonparametric estimation of time-dependent ROC curves conditional on a continuous covariate.']"""

Charlson comorbidity index ranged from 3 to 12. Serum PSA ranged from 4.30 to 662 ng/mL (median 13 ng/mL). On histologic examination, bizarre giant cells with pleomorphic nuclei characterized pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma of the prostate. PGCC component was present in 5% to 100%, with half of the patients presenting with ≥ 20%. Half of the patients initially presented with T4 and 26% with T3 disease. All patients were considered Gleason scores of 9 to 10 (ISUP grade 5). A combination of hormone therapy with chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy was applied in 68% of patients. On follow-up, 14 patients (52%) were alive with disease (1-69 months) or dead of disease (1-38 months). Patients diagnosed earlier with lower TNM stage had longer survival than those diagnosed at a later T-stage or with metastatic disease (p = 0.02). The percentage of PGCC was not related to survival in the current study. Molecular alterations in 3 samples showed a microsatellite-stable disease with low tumor mutation burden and variable PTEN, PTCH1, KDM6A, ARv7, and PIK3CA loss/alteration, TP53 mutation, TMPRSS2-ERG fusion, and MYC, PIK3CB, RICTOR, or IRS2 amplification.

PI-RADSAI is a two-stage, human-in-the-loop AI capable of emulating the diagnostic acumen of subspecialists for PCa on MRI. The first stage uses a UNet-Seg model to detect and segment biopsy-candidate prostate lesions, whereas the second stage leverages UNet-Seg segmentation is trained specifically with subspecialist' knowledge-guided 3D-Resnet to achieve an automatic AI-aided diagnosis for PCa.  Results:   In the independent test set, UNet-Seg identified 87.2% (628/720) of target lesions, with a Dice score of 44.9% (range, 22.8-60.2%) in segmenting lesion contours. In the ablation experiment, the model trained with the data from three centres was superior (kappa coefficient, 0.716 vs. 0.531) to that trained with single-centre data. In the internal and external tests, the triple-centre PI-RADSAI model achieved an overall agreement of 58.4% (188/322) and 60.1% (92/153) with a referential subspecialist in scoring target lesions; when one-point margin of error was permissible, the agreement rose to 91.3% (294/322) and 97.3% (149/153), respectively.

To analyze the frequency of 16 KIR genes and 5 HLA ligands, polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) was conducted in 150 PC patients and 200 healthy controls (CNs).

Moreover, a lower frequency of the genotypes contacting activating KIR (aKIR) > inhibitory KIR (iKIR) (p = 0.0298, OR = 0.5291, CI = 0.3056-0.9174) and iKIR + HLA < aKIR + HLA (p = 0.0183, OR = 0.2197, CI = 0.0672-0.7001) in PC patients compared to the CNs implies a protective role for aKIR genes. In the case of KIR-HLA interactions, we detected a significant association between KIR3DS1+ + HLA-A Bw4+ (p = 0.0113, OR = 0.5093, CI = 0.3124-0.8416) and KIR3DL1- + HLA-A Bw4+ (p = 0.0306, OR = 0.1153, CI = 0.0106-0.6537) combinations and resistance to prostate cancer. In contrast, the presence of KIR3DL1 in the absence of HLA-A Bw4 (p = 0.0040, OR = 2.00, CI = 1.264-3.111), HLA Bw4 (p = 0.0296, OR = 2.066, CI = 1.094-3.906), and HLA-Bw4Thr80 (p = 0.0071, OR = 2.505, CI = 1.319-4.703) genes probably predisposes to prostate cancer. Carrying the CxT4 genotype in PC patients was positively associated with lower tumor grades (Gleason score ≤ 6) (p = 0.0331, OR = 3.290, and CI = 1.181-8.395).

An electronic survey was distributed to competent authorities of 32 HERCA member states. The questionnaire addressed 33 explicitly considered treatments using 13 different radionuclides, and for each treatment, a similar set of questions was included. Questions covered the use of treatments, hospitalisation of patients and radioactive waste management related to therapeutic nuclear medicine involving other radionuclides than the well-known131I. The survey also covered justification of treatments, individual treatment planning, involvement of a medical physics expert (MPE) and radiation protection instructions given to the patient at the time of release. Responses were obtained from 20 HERCA countries. All of these countries used Na[131I]I for benign thyroid diseases and thyroid ablation of adults. 223RaCl2(Xofigo®) for bone metastases,177Lu-somatostatin analogues for neuroendocrine tumours and177Lu-labelled PSMA for castration resistant prostate cancer (PC) and PC-metastases were used in 90%, 65% and 55% of countries, respectively. Only a few countries had specific criteria for hospitalisation and waste management for new therapeutic nuclear medicine. Regulatory requirements for justification of new therapeutic nuclear medicine were in place in almost all countries. Individual treatment planning was required for all therapies in 55% and for some therapies in 28% of the responding countries. Implementation of the requirement for MPEs to be closely involved in nuclear medicine practices varied to a great extend among countries. Almost all responding countries answered that some radiation protection instructions existed for patients released after treatment with radionuclides other than131I treatment, however only few countries had developed specific guidelines in the field.""","""['Ritva Bly']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Radiol Prot""","""['Variations in the practice of molecular radiotherapy and implementation of dosimetry: results from a European survey.', 'European activities in radiation protection in medicine.', 'Variations in the practice of molecular radiotherapy and implementation of dosimetry: results from a European survey.', 'National Radon Action Plans in Europe and Need of Effectiveness Indicators: An Overview of HERCA Activities.', 'Medical physics in Europe following recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency.', 'Criteria and suspension levels in diagnostic radiology.']"""

To adopt this technique, institutions may need to evaluate the suitability of existing infrastructure.  Purpose:   Develop a methodology to determine whether existing facilities can accommodate a 177 Lu-PSMA therapy program.  Methods:   Room suitability is defined by both the ability to accommodate 177 Lu-PSMA therapy workflow and to provide appropriate radiation shielding. Two methods of shielding calculation were performed: (1) National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements report 151 (NCRP-151), with workload defined in terms of the activity of 177 Lu administered, and (2) using the RadPro shielding calculator. This methodology was applied to 131 I therapy, PET-CT uptake, PET-SPECT injection, and orthovoltage therapy rooms.  Results: 131 I therapy rooms were found to meet both shielding and workflow requirements. The shielding was found to be adequate for orthovoltage and PET-SPECT facilities, neglecting patient transit between external washrooms. The workflow was the limiting factor for these rooms due to the requirement of dedicated washrooms that shield the patient and contain possible contamination. The PET-CT facility did not meet either criteria. The NCRP-151 method generally predicted a higher dose rate on the other side of shielding than did the RadPro calculator. The dose rate on the other side of concrete shielding as predicted by the NCRP-151 method increased relative to the dose rate predicted by the RadPro calculator as shielding thickness increased. For lead shielding, the dose rate predicted by the NCRP-151 method decreased relative to the result predicted by the RadPro calculator with increasing material thickness.  Conclusions: 131 I therapy, PET-CT uptake, PET-SPECT injection, and orthovoltage therapy rooms were considered. The 131 I treatment rooms were the best candidate for 177 Lu-PSMA therapy, due to their shielding and capability to accommodate the necessary workflow.""","""['N Murtha', 'H Morrison', 'M Roumeliotis', 'S Quirk', 'W Smith', 'A Blais']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['177LuLu-PSMA-617 versus cabazitaxel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (TheraP): a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial.', 'Results of a Prospective Phase 2 Pilot Trial of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Including Imaging Predictors of Treatment Response and Patterns of Progression.', 'Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', 'A Walk with Lu-177 PSMA: How Close we Have Reached from Bench to Bedside?', 'Next generation radiotheranostics promoting precision medicine.']"""

We conducted a Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) study to evaluate the association between ADT and fracture risk in patient with prostate cancer in Taiwan.  Methods:   Between 2001 and 2008, data from the Taiwan NHIRD was collected. We separated newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients into four groups: the injection of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists and antagonists group, the orchiectomy group, the oral antiandorgens group and the radical prostatectomy only group. A non-cancer matched control group was also assigned for comparison. T tests, chi-squared tests, multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression were performed. A subsequent fracture event was defined according to the appropriate diagnosis codes (ICD9-CM 800-829) with hospitalization. Patients with fracture before their diagnosis with prostate cancer were excluded.  Results:   Overall, 22517 newly diagnosed patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. After exclusion criteria were applied, 13321 patients were separated into the injection group (5020 subjects), the orchiectomy group (1193 subjects), the oral group (6059 subjects) and the radical prostatectomy only group (1049 subjects).

The purpose of this study was to apply a new deep learning algorithm, the bi-directional convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) network, and the radiomics analysis for differential diagnosis of PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). To systematically investigate the optimal amount of peritumoral tissue for improving diagnosis, a total of 9 ROIs were delineated by using 3 different methods.

While there is evidence for a higher genetic predisposition for incidence of PCa in men of African ancestry compared to men of European ancestry, there have been few transcriptomic studies on PCa in men of African ancestry in the African continent.  Objective:   We performed transcriptomic profiling and fusion analysis on bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) samples from 24 Nigerian PCa patients to investigate the transcriptomic and genomic rearrangement landscape of PCa in Nigerian men.  Design:   Bulk RNA-seq was performed on 24 formalin-fixed paraffin-embeded (FFPE) prostatectomy specimens of Nigerian men. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on 11 high-quality samples. Arriba Fusion and STAR Fusion were used for fusion detection.  Results:   4/11 (36%) of the samples harbored an erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) fusion event; 1/11 (9%) had a TMPRSS2-ERG fusion; 2/11 had a TMPRSS2-ETV5 fusion, and 1/11 had a SLC45A3-SKIL fusion. Hierarchical clustering of normalized and mean-centered gene expression showed clustering of fusion positive samples. Furthermore, we developed gene set signatures for Nigerian PCa based on fusion events. By projecting the cancer genome atlas prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) bulk RNA-seq data set onto the transcriptional space defined by these signatures derived from Nigerian PCa patients, we identified a positive correlation between the Nigerian fusion signature and fusion positive samples in the TCGA-PRAD data set.  Conclusions:   Less frequent ETS fusion events other than TMPRSS2-ERG such as TMPRSS2-ETV5 and non-ETS fusion events such as SLC45A3-SKIL may be more common in PCa in Nigerian men. This study provides useful working transcriptomic signatures that characterize oncogenic states representative of specific gene fusion events in PCa from Nigerian men.""","""['Yusuph Mavura', 'Hanbing Song', 'Jamie Xie', 'Pablo Tamayo', 'Abdullahi Mohammed', 'Ahmad T Lawal', 'Ahmad Bello', 'Sani Ibrahim', 'Mohammed Faruk', 'Franklin W Huang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['ETS family-associated gene fusions in Japanese prostate cancer: analysis of 194 radical prostatectomy samples.', 'Prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG and SLC45A3-ERG gene fusions in a large prostatectomy cohort.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.', 'Prevalence of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancer among men undergoing prostate biopsy in the United States.', 'TMPRSS2:ERG Gene Fusions in Prostate Cancer of West African Men and a Meta-Analysis of Racial Differences.']"""

Recent preclinical studies suggested ~30x higher kidney absorbed dose for [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T compared to [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, which may lead to an increased risk of kidney toxicity. We performed two single-centre, prospective dosimetry studies with either [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 or [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T, using an identical dosimetry protocol. We evaluated the absorbed doses of both 177 Lu-labelled radioligands in human kidneys.  Methods:   3D SPECT/computed tomography (CT) imaging of the kidneys was performed after PSMA-RLT in cancer patients with PSMA-positive disease and an adequate glomerular filtration rate (≥50 mL/min). Ten metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients (mHSPC) were treated with [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and 10 advanced salivary gland cancer (SGC) patients were treated with [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T. SPECT/CT imaging was performed at five timepoints (1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h post-injection). In mHSPC patients, SPECT/CT imaging was performed after cycles 1 and 2 (cumulative activity: 9 GBq) and in SGC patients only after cycle 1 (activity: 7.4 GBq). Kidney absorbed dose was calculated using organ-based dosimetry.  Results:   The median kidney absorbed dose was 0.49 Gy/GBq (range: 0.34-0.66) and 0.73 Gy/GBq (range: 0.42-1.31) for [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T, respectively (independent samples t test; P = 0.010).  Conclusion:   This study shows that the kidney absorbed dose for [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T differs, with a ~1.5x higher median kidney absorbed dose for [ 177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T.

We studied the mechanisms associated with its anticancer activity in advanced human prostate carcinoma cells. We found that decursin inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by inhibiting its activating phosphorylation at tyrosine 1068 residue in DU145 and 22Rv1 cells. This inhibition of EGFR was associated with the downregulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Both EGFR and ERK1/2 are known to be deregulated/activated in many human malignancies. Consistent with our earlier study, decursin (25-100 µM) treatment for 24-72 h inhibited DU145 cell proliferation by 49%-87% (p < 0.001) which was associated with strong G1 phase arrest and cell death. It also decreased (p < 0.001) the number of surviving colonies. Decursin moderately increased the expression of Rb-related proteins p107 and p130 but decreased the levels of E2F family transcription factors including E2F-3, E2F-4 and E2F-5. Further, decursin strongly inhibited the growth of androgen-dependent prostate carcinoma 22Rv1 cells from 61% to 79% (p < 0.001) and arrested these cells at G1 phase via induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27/Kip1 and downregulation of CDK2 and CDK4 protein expression. Additionally, EGFR inhibitor erlotinib- and EGF ligand-modulated EGFR activation validated EGFR signaling as a target of decursin-mediated cell growth inhibition and cytotoxicity. Decursin decreased EGF ligand-induced phosphorylation of EGFR (Y-1068) as well as activation of its downstream mediator, ERK1/2. Furthermore, inhibitory targeting of EGFR-ERK1/2 axis by combinatorial treatment of decursin and erlotinib further sensitized DU145 cells for the decursin-induced growth inhibition and cell death. Overall, these findings strongly suggest that anticancer efficacy of decursin against human PCa involves inhibitory targeting of EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling axis, a pathway constitutively active in advanced PCa.""","""['Tariq A Bhat', 'Arpit Dheeraj', 'Dhanya K Nambiar', 'Surya Pratap Singh', 'Dong Sool Yim', 'Rana P Singh']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Grape seed extract inhibits EGF-induced and constitutively active mitogenic signaling but activates JNK in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells: possible role in antiproliferation and apoptosis.', 'A novel anticancer agent, decursin, induces G1 arrest and apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Silibinin impairs constitutively active TGFalpha-EGFR autocrine loop in advanced human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Inositol hexaphosphate inhibits growth, and induces G1 arrest and apoptotic death of prostate carcinoma DU145 cells: modulation of CDKI-CDK-cyclin and pRb-related protein-E2F complexes.', 'Cell signaling and regulators of cell cycle as molecular targets for prostate cancer prevention by dietary agents.']"""

Study design:   Descriptive study.  Place and duration of study:   Department of Radiology, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey, from January 2018 to October 2021.  Methodology:   The data of 111 patients with a diagnosis of PCa and chronic prostatitis, were retrospectively analysed who underwent mpMRI of the prostate were retrospectively analysed. Histopathological verification was available in 57 of 57 prostate carcinoma patients and 20 of 54 chronic prostatitis cases. The detection of lesions from the images and the correlation of the detected lesions with their histopathological diagnoses were made by the joint decision of two radiologists. The LGER measurements were made independently by both radiologists. Signal intensity (SI) values of the lesions were obtained by placing a hand-drawn ROI on pre-contrast and late post-contrast images. Late enhancement ratio was calculated from the ratio of the difference between the pre- and post-contrast SI values to the pre-contrast SI values. The LGER values obtained were statistically compared between the pathologically proven PCa and chronic prostatitis patient groups.  Results:   The prostatitis LGER values (103.40 ± 31.54%) were significantly higher than the PCa values (79.71±27.39, p<0.001). The LGER values of lesions with a Gleason score <7 were lower than those of lesions scoring ≥7 (p = 0.004). The LGER values of PI-RADS-3 PCa lesions were lower than those of PI-RADS-4 and PI-RADS-5 (p = 0.002). In the late post-contrast phase, low signal measurements in PI-RADS-3 lesions excluded the presence of prostatitis.

However, the detailed function of circRNA in prostate cancer (PCa) is still largely unknown.  Methods:   We quantified circTFDP2 expression in PCa tissues and adjacent normal tissues using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Colony formation, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), flow cytometry, transwell, and in vivo progression and metastasis assays were applied to reveal the proliferation and metastatic abilities of circTFDP2 in PCa cells. Mass spectrometry, RNA pulldown, RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP), western blotting and immunofluorescence were used for the mechanistic studies. qRT-PCR and RIP assays were used to explore the regulatory role of eIF4A3 in the biogenesis of circTFDP2. Finally, functional assays showed the effect of circTFDP2-containing exosomes on PCa cell progression.  Results:   circTFDP2 was upregulated in PCa tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, high circTFDP2 expression was positively correlated with the Gleason score. Functionally, circTFDP2 promoted PCa cell proliferation and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, circTFDP2 interacted with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) protein in its DNA-binding domain to prevent it from active caspase-3-dependent cleavage, and finally relieved PCa cells from DNA damage. In addition, RNA-binding protein eIF4A3 can interact with the flanking region of circTFDP2 and promote the biogenesis of circTFDP2. Moreover, exosome-derived circTFDP2 promoted PCa cell progression.  Conclusions:   In general, our study demonstrated that circTFDP2 promoted PCa cell progression through the PARP1/DNA damage axis, which may be a promising therapeutic target for PCa.""","""['Lifeng Ding', 'Qiming Zheng', 'Yudong Lin', 'Ruyue Wang', 'Huan Wang', 'Wenqin Luo', 'Zeyi Lu', 'Haiyun Xie', 'Liangliang Ren', 'Haohua Lu', 'Chenhao Yu', 'Jixuan Zhang', 'Danyang Shen', 'Sheng Cheng', 'Liqun Xia', 'Gonghui Li', 'Dingwei Xue']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Transl Med""","""['Hsa_circ_0004296 inhibits metastasis of prostate cancer by interacting with EIF4A3 to prevent nuclear export of ETS1 mRNA.', 'CircLRP6 contributes to prostate cancer growth and metastasis by binding to miR-330-5p to up-regulate NRBP1.', 'CircSMARCA5 Facilitates the Progression of Prostate Cancer Through miR-432/PDCD10 Axis.', 'Exosomal Circ-XIAP Promotes Docetaxel Resistance in Prostate Cancer by Regulating miR-1182/TPD52 Axis.', 'Circular RNA midline-1 (circMID1) promotes proliferation, migration, invasion and glycolysis in prostate cancer.', 'Recent advances of exosomal circRNAs in cancer and their potential clinical applications.', 'Mechanism of tumor-derived extracellular vesicles in prostatic cancer progression through the circFMN2/KLF2/RNF128 axis.', 'The Loss-Function of KNL1 Causes Oligospermia and Asthenospermia in Mice by Affecting the Assembly and Separation of the Spindle through Flow Cytometry and Immunofluorescence.']"""

Paralleling an aging society, prostate cancer prevalence increases emphasizing the need for efficient diagnostic algorithms.  Methods:   Retrospectively, 106 prostate tissue samples from 48 patients (mean age, [Formula: see text] years) were included in the study. Patients suffered from prostate cancer (n = 38) or benign prostatic hyperplasia (n = 10) and were treated with radical prostatectomy or Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, respectively. We constructed tissue microarrays (TMAs) comprising representative malignant (n = 38) and benign (n = 68) tissue cores. TMAs were processed to histological slides, stained, digitized and assessed for the applicability of machine learning strategies and open-source tools in diagnosis of prostate cancer. We applied the software QuPath to extract features for shape, stain intensity, and texture of TMA cores for three stainings, H&E, ERG, and PIN-4. Three machine learning algorithms, neural network (NN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF), were trained and cross-validated with 100 Monte Carlo random splits into 70% training set and 30% test set. We determined AUC values for single color channels, with and without optimization of hyperparameters by exhaustive grid search. We applied recursive feature elimination to feature sets of multiple color transforms.  Results:   Mean AUC was above 0.80. PIN-4 stainings yielded higher AUC than H&E and ERG. For PIN-4 with the color transform saturation, NN, RF, and SVM revealed AUC of [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text], respectively. Optimization of hyperparameters improved the AUC only slightly by 0.01. For H&E, feature selection resulted in no increase of AUC but to an increase of 0.02-0.06 for ERG and PIN-4.  Conclusions:   Automated pipelines may be able to discriminate with high accuracy between malignant and benign tissue. We found PIN-4 staining best suited for classification. Further bioinformatic analysis of larger data sets would be crucial to evaluate the reliability of automated classification methods for clinical practice and to evaluate potential discrimination of aggressiveness of cancer to pave the way to automatic precision medicine.""","""['Yauheniya Zhdanovich', 'Jörg Ackermann', 'Peter J Wild', 'Jens Köllermann', 'Katrin Bankov', 'Claudia Döring', 'Nadine Flinner', 'Henning Reis', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Benedikt Höh', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Thomas J Vogl', 'Patrick Harter', 'Katharina Filipski', 'Ina Koch', 'Simon Bernatz']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Bioinformatics""","""['Comparison of machine learning algorithms to predict clinically significant prostate cancer of the peripheral zone with multiparametric MRI using clinical assessment categories and radiomic features.', 'Machine learning approaches to analyze histological images of tissues from radical prostatectomies.', 'Multiview boosting digital pathology analysis of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Optimization of initial prostate biopsy in clinical practice: sampling, labeling and specimen processing.']"""

The AKR1C3/AR-V7 complex has been recognized as a major driver for drug resistance in advanced prostate cancer.

PTUPB synergizes with enzalutamide treatment in tumor suppression and gene signature regulation. Combination treatments with PTUPB and enzalutamide provide benefits by blocking AR/AR-V7 signaling, which inhibits the growth of castration relapsed VCaP xenograft tumors and patient-derived xenograft organoids.

We previously reported two very potent CBSIs, the dihydroquinoxalinone compounds 5 m and 5t. In this study, we further optimized the structures of compounds 5 m and 5t and integrated them to generate a new analog, SB226. X-ray crystal structure studies and a tubulin polymerization assay confirmed that SB226 is a CBSI that could disrupt the microtubule dynamics and interfere with microtubule assembly. Biophysical measurements using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy verified the high binding affinity of SB226 to tubulin dimers. The in vitro studies showed that SB226 possessed sub-nanomolar anti-proliferative activities with an average IC50 of 0.76 nM against a panel of cancer cell lines, some of which are paclitaxel-resistant, including melanoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer cells. SB226 inhibited the colony formation and migration of Taxol-resistant A375/TxR cells, and induced their G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis. Our subsequent in vivo studies confirmed that 4 mg/kg SB226 strongly inhibited the tumor growth of A375/TxR melanoma xenografts in mice and induced necrosis, anti-angiogenesis, and apoptosis in tumors.

Methods:   Literature studies on cryoablation and oncology from 2001 to 2020 were extracted from the Web of Science. A bibliometric analysis was performed based on the annual publication volume, several journal articles and local citation score, and distribution of keywords and trends in the literature using tools such as COOC version 9.94, VOSviewer version 1.6.17, and the bibliometrix version 3.1.3 R package.

After 2012, 2 new research topics emerged: synergy between cryoablation and immunotherapy in tumors and cryoablation of Barrett esophagus. The high cited literatures are dominated by studies related to cryoablation for renal and prostate cancer treatment, but they also reflect the recent increasing interest in immunotherapy and bone metastases.

Observational data, although readily available, is sensitive to biases such as confounding by indication. Structure learning algorithms for Bayesian Networks (BNs) can be used to discover the underlying model from data. This enables identification of confounders through graph analysis, although the model might contain noncausal edges. We propose using a blacklist to aid structure learning in finding causal relationships. This is illustrated by an analysis into the effect of active treatment (v observation) in localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   In total, 4,121 prostate cancer records were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Subsequently, we developed a (causal) BN using structure learning while precluding noncausal relations. Additionally, we created several Cox proportional hazards models, each correcting for a different set of potential confounders (including propensity scores). Model predictions for overall survival were compared with expected survival on the basis of the general population using data from Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek).  Results:   Structure learning precluding noncausal relations resulted in a causal graph but did not identify significant edges toward treatment; they were added manually. Graph analysis identified year of diagnosis and age as confounders. The BN predicted a treatment effect of 1 percentage point at 10 years. Chi-squared analysis found significant associations between year of diagnosis, age, stage, and treatment. Propensity score correction was successful. Adjusted Cox models predicted significant treatment effect around 3 percentage points at 10 years.  Conclusion:   A blacklist in conjunction with structure learning can result in a causal BN that can be used for confounder identification. Treatment effect found here is close to the 5 percentage point found in the literature.""","""['Melle Sieswerda', 'Shixuan Xie', 'Ruby van Rossum', 'Inigo Bermejo', 'Gijs Geleijnse', 'Katja Aben', 'Felice van Erning', 'Valery Lemmens', 'André Dekker', 'Xander Verbeek']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""['Developing Bayesian networks from a dependency-layered ontology: A proof-of-concept in radiation oncology.', 'Machine learning for improved pathological staging of prostate cancer: a performance comparison on a range of classifiers.', 'Comparison of Logistic Regression and Bayesian Networks for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer Recurrence.', 'A comprehensive scoping review of Bayesian networks in healthcare: Past, present and future.', 'Review of the comparative effectiveness of radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, or expectant management of localized prostate cancer in registry data.']"""

However, the mechanism underlying its lineage-specific activation of Notch (N), Wnt, or EZH2-three well-characterized oncogenic targets of ERG-remains elusive. We reasoned that deep homology in genetic tool kits might help uncover such elusive cancer mechanisms in Drosophila. By heterologous gain of human ERG in Drosophila, here we reveal Chip, which codes for a transcriptional coactivator, LIM-domain-binding (LDB) protein, as its novel target. ERG represses Drosophila Chip via its direct binding and, indirectly, via E(z)-mediated silencing of its promoter. Downregulation of Chip disrupts LIM-HD complex formed between Chip and Tailup (Tup)-a LIM-HD transcription factor-in the developing notum. A consequent activation of N-driven Wg signaling leads to notum-to-wing transdetermination. These fallouts of ERG gain are arrested upon a simultaneous gain of Chip, sequestration of Wg ligand, and, alternatively, loss of N signaling or E(z) activity. Finally, we show that the human LDB1, a homolog of Drosophila Chip, is repressed in ERG-positive prostate cancer cells. Besides identifying an elusive target of human ERG, our study unravels an underpinning of its lineage-specific carcinogenesis.""","""['Mahima Bharti', 'Anjali Bajpai', 'Umanshi Rautela', 'Nishat Manzar', 'Bushra Ateeq', 'Pradip Sinha']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Chip/Ldb1 interacts with Tailup/islet1 to regulate cardiac gene expression in Drosophila.', 'tailup, a LIM-HD gene, and Iro-C cooperate in Drosophila dorsal mesothorax specification.', 'EZH2-induced lysine K362 methylation enhances TMPRSS2-ERG oncogenic activity in prostate cancer.', 'Drosophila genes that encode LIM-domain containing proteins: their organization, functions, and interactions.', 'The Expression of Proto-Oncogene ETS-Related Gene (ERG) Plays a Central Role in the Oncogenic Mechanism Involved in the Development and Progression of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Several recent studies have shown the involvement of lncRNA in various human diseases, such as gastric cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and so forth. However, obtaining lncRNA-disease relationship only through biological experiments not only costs manpower and material resources but also gains little. Therefore, developing effective computational models for predicting lncRNA-disease association relationship is extremely important. This study aimed to propose an lncRNA-disease association prediction model based on the weight matrix and projection score (LDAP-WMPS). The model used the relatively perfect lncRNA-miRNA relationship data and miRNA-disease relationship data to predict the lncRNA-disease relationship. The integrated lncRNA similarity matrix and the integrated disease similarity matrix were established by fusing various methods to calculate the similarity between lncRNA and disease. This study improved the existing weight algorithm, applied it to the lncRNA-miRNA-disease triple network, and thus proposed a new lncRNA-disease weight matrix calculation method. Combined with the improved projection algorithm, the lncRNA-miRNA relationship and miRNA-disease relationship were used to predict the lncRNA-disease relationship. The simulation results showed that under the Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation framework, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of LDAP-WMPS could reach 0.8822, which was better than the latest result. Taking adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer as examples, the LDAP-WMPS model was found to effectively infer the lncRNA-disease relationship. The simulation results showed good prediction performance of the LDAP-WMPS model, which was an important supplement to the research of lncRNA-disease association prediction without lncRNA-disease relationship data.""","""['Bo Wang', 'Chao Zhang', 'Xiao-Xin Du', 'Xiao-Dong Zheng', 'Jing-You Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['lncRNA-disease association prediction based on matrix decomposition of elastic network and collaborative filtering.', 'lncRNA-disease association prediction based on latent factor model and projection.', 'LDAP: a web server for lncRNA-disease association prediction.', 'Computational models for lncRNA function prediction and functional similarity calculation.', 'RWSF-BLP: a novel lncRNA-disease association prediction model using random walk-based multi-similarity fusion and bidirectional label propagation.', 'CircPCBL: Identification of Plant CircRNAs with a CNN-BiGRU-GLT Model.']"""

Observational studies have linked the use of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) lowering therapies with reduced risk of PrCa, which may potentially be attributable to confounding factors. In this study, we performed a drug target Mendelian randomisation (MR) analysis to evaluate the association of genetically proxied inhibition of LDL-c-lowering drug targets on risk of PrCa.  Methods and findings:   Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with LDL-c (P < 5 × 10-8) from the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 1,320,016) and located in and around the HMGCR, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 genes were used to proxy the therapeutic inhibition of these targets. Summary-level data regarding the risk of total, advanced, and early-onset PrCa were obtained from the PRACTICAL consortium. Validation analyses were performed using genetic instruments from an LDL-c GWAS conducted on male UK Biobank participants of European ancestry (N = 201,678), as well as instruments selected based on liver-derived gene expression and circulation plasma levels of targets. We also investigated whether putative mediators may play a role in findings for traits previously implicated in PrCa risk (i.e., lipoprotein a (Lp(a)), body mass index (BMI), and testosterone). Applying two-sample MR using the inverse-variance weighted approach provided strong evidence supporting an effect of genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 (equivalent to a standard deviation (SD) reduction in LDL-c) on lower risk of total PrCa (odds ratio (OR) = 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.76 to 0.96, P = 9.15 × 10-3) and early-onset PrCa (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52 to 0.95, P = 0.023). Genetically proxied HMGCR inhibition provided a similar central effect estimate on PrCa risk, although with a wider 95% CI (OR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.62 to 1.13, P = 0.244), whereas genetically proxied NPC1L1 inhibition had an effect on higher PrCa risk with a 95% CI that likewise included the null (OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 0.87 to 2.04, P = 0.180). Analyses using male-stratified instruments provided consistent results. Secondary MR analyses supported a genetically proxied effect of liver-specific PCSK9 expression (OR = 0.90 per SD reduction in PCSK9 expression, 95% CI = 0.86 to 0.95, P = 5.50 × 10-5) and circulating plasma levels of PCSK9 (OR = 0.93 per SD reduction in PCSK9 protein levels, 95% CI = 0.87 to 0.997, P = 0.04) on PrCa risk. Colocalization analyses identified strong evidence (posterior probability (PPA) = 81.3%) of a shared genetic variant (rs553741) between liver-derived PCSK9 expression and PrCa risk, whereas weak evidence was found for HMGCR (PPA = 0.33%) and NPC1L1 expression (PPA = 0.38%). Moreover, genetically proxied PCSK9 inhibition was strongly associated with Lp(a) levels (Beta = -0.08, 95% CI = -0.12 to -0.05, P = 1.00 × 10-5), but not BMI or testosterone, indicating a possible role for Lp(a) in the biological mechanism underlying the association between PCSK9 and PrCa. Notably, we emphasise that our estimates are based on a lifelong exposure that makes direct comparisons with trial results challenging.  Conclusions:   Our study supports a strong association between genetically proxied inhibition of PCSK9 and a lower risk of total and early-onset PrCa, potentially through an alternative mechanism other than the on-target effect on LDL-c. Further evidence from clinical studies is needed to confirm this finding as well as the putative mediatory role of Lp(a).""","""['Si Fang', 'James Yarmolinsky', 'Dipender Gill', 'Caroline J Bull', 'Claire M Perks;PRACTICAL Consortium;George Davey Smith', 'Tom R Gaunt', 'Tom G Richardson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS Med""","""['Associations of genetically proxied inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, NPC1L1, and PCSK9 with breast cancer and prostate cancer.', 'Association Between Genetically Proxied Inhibition of HMG-CoA Reductase and Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.', 'Using genetic variants to evaluate the causal effect of cholesterol lowering on head and neck cancer risk: A Mendelian randomization study.', 'Lipid traits and type 2 diabetes risk in African ancestry individuals: A Mendelian Randomization study.', 'Genetic Association of Lipids and Lipid Drug Targets With Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: A Meta-analysis.', 'Pseurotin A Validation as a Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Recurrence-Suppressing Lead via PCSK9-LDLR Axis Modulation.', 'The evolving landscape of PCSK9 inhibition in cancer.']"""

Methods:   Patients treated with RARP between 2020 and 2021 were selected. WE® calculates the Malignancy Attention Index (MAI), starting from the information contained in the mpMRI images. Outcome measures were the capability to predict the presence of PCa, to correctly locate the dominant lesion, to delimit the largest diameter of the dominant lesion, and to predict the extraprostatic extension (EPE).  Results:   Overall, tumor presence was confirmed in 46 (92%) WE® highly suspicious areas, while it was confirmed in 43 (86%) mpMRI PI-RADS ≥ 4 lesions. The WE® showed a positive agreement with mpMRI of 92%. In 98% of cases, visible tumor at WE® showed that the highly suspicious areas were within the same prostate sector of the dominant tumor nodule at pathology. WE® showed a 2.5 mm median difference of diameter with pathology, compared with a 3.8 mm of mpMRI versus pathology (p = 0.019). In prediction of EPE, WE® and mpMRI showed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value of 0.81 vs 0.71, 0.56 vs 0.60, 0.88 vs 0.85 and 0.42 vs 0.40, respectively.

Methods:   Patients treated at OUI completed interval post-treatment questionnaires that assessed: urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal function, and overall treatment satisfaction. Two cohorts were established: prostatectomy vs radiation. Results from each cohort were compared and analyzed with a linear mixed effect model.  Results:   Our longitudinal dataset includes a prostatectomy cohort of 410 patients and radiation therapy cohort of 416 patients surveyed at the 3-month interval, but the number of patients decreased after each time interval (ie 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and then annually for up till 14 years post-treatment). Urinary and sexual functional scores decreased by 4% and 8% after radiation, whereas prostatectomy had a 5% and 13% increase over time post-treatment, respectively.

Rapid histology of core needle biopsies is essential to ensure the precise FT for localized lesions and to determine tumor grades. However, it is difficult to achieve both high accuracy and speed with currently available histopathology methods. Here, we demonstrated that stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy could reveal the largely heterogeneous histologic features of fresh prostatic biopsy tissues in a label-free and near real-time manner. A diagnostic convolutional neural network (CNN) built based on images from 61 patients could classify Gleason patterns of prostate cancer with an accuracy of 85.7%. An additional 22 independent cases introduced as external test dataset validated the CNN performance with 84.4% accuracy. Gleason scores of core needle biopsies from 21 cases were calculated using the deep learning SRS system and showed a 71% diagnostic consistency with grading from three pathologists. This study demonstrates the potential of a deep learning-assisted SRS platform in evaluating the tumor grade of prostate cancer, which could help simplify the diagnostic workflow and provide timely histopathology compatible with FT treatment.

Patients and methods:   This was a single-centre series of men with biopsy-proven radio-recurrent PCa treated with IRE between December 2013 and February 2022, with a minimum follow-up of 6 months. Follow-up included magnetic resonance imaging at 6 months, and standard transperineal saturation template biopsies at 12 months. Further biopsies were guided by suspicion on serial imaging or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Validated questionnaires were used to measure functional outcomes. Significant local recurrence was defined as any International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) score ≥ 2 on biopsies. Progression-free survival was defined as no signs of local or systemic disease on either imaging or template biopsies, or according to the Phoenix criteria for biochemical recurrence.  Results:   Final analysis was performed on 74 men with radio-recurrent PCa (median age 69 years, median PSA level 5.4 ng/mL, 76% ISUP score 2/3). The median (range) follow-up was 48 (27-68) months. One rectal fistula occurred, and eight patients developed urethral sloughing that resolved with transurethral resection. Among patients who returned questionnaires (30/74, 41%), 93% (28/30) had preserved urinary continence and 23% (7/30) had sustained erectile function at 12-month follow-up.

We investigated the tumor-homing properties of a chromogranin A-derived peptide containing an RGDL motif followed by a chemically stapled alpha-helix (called ""5a""), which selectively recognizes the LAP/TGFβ complex-binding site of αvβ6 and αvβ8. Methods: Peptide 5a was labeled with IRDye 800CW (a near-infrared fluorescent dye) or with 18F-NOTA (a label for positron emission tomography (PET)); the integrin-binding properties of free peptide and conjugates were then investigated using purified αvβ6/αvβ8 integrins and various αvβ6/αvβ8 single - or double-positive cancer cells; tumor-homing, biodistribution and imaging properties of the conjugates were investigated in subcutaneous and orthotopic αvβ6-positive carcinomas of the pancreas, and in mice bearing subcutaneous αvβ8-positive prostate tumors. Results: In vitro studies showed that 5a can bind both integrins with high affinity and inhibits cell-mediated TGFβ activation. The 5a-IRDye and 5a-NOTA conjugates could bind purified αvβ6/αvβ8 integrins with no loss of affinity compared to free peptide, and selectively recognized various αvβ6/αvβ8 single- or double-positive cancer cells, including cells from pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, oral mucosa, bladder and prostate cancer. In vivo static and dynamic optical near-infrared and PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies, performed in mice with subcutaneous and orthotopic αvβ6-positive carcinomas of the pancreas, showed high target-specific uptake of fluorescence- and radio-labeled peptide by tumors and low non-specific uptake in other organs and tissues, except for excretory organs. Significant target-specific uptake of fluorescence-labeled peptide was also observed in mice bearing αvβ8-positive prostate tumors. Conclusions: The results indicate that 5a can home to αvβ6- and/or αvβ8-positive tumors, suggesting that this peptide can be exploited as a ligand for delivering imaging or anticancer agents to αvβ6/αvβ8 single- or double-positive tumors, or as a tumor-homing inhibitor of these TGFβ activators.""","""['Matteo Monieri', 'Paolo Rainone', 'Angelina Sacchi', 'Alessandro Gori', 'Anna Maria Gasparri', 'Angela Coliva', 'Antonio Citro', 'Benedetta Ferrara', 'Martina Policardi', 'Silvia Valtorta', 'Arianna Pocaterra', 'Massimo Alfano', 'Dean Sheppard', 'Lorenzo Piemonti', 'Rosa Maria Moresco', 'Angelo Corti', 'Flavio Curnis']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""['PET/CT imaging of head-and-neck and pancreatic cancer in humans by targeting the ""Cancer Integrin"" αvβ6 with Ga-68-Trivehexin.', 'Comparison of the RGD Motif-Containing αvβ6 Integrin-Binding Peptides SFLAP3 and SFITGv6 for Diagnostic Application in HNSCC.', 'A stapled chromogranin A-derived peptide is a potent dual ligand for integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8.', 'Near-infrared Dye®800CW–conjugated disulfide-based cyclic RGD peptide c(CRGDKGPDC) and its DOTA analog.', 'The role of integrins in TGFβ activation in the tumour stroma.']"""

On the other hand, Pt(IV) prodrugs have been employed as an interesting alternative to the more common Pt(II) complexes, such as cisplatin, for cancer chemotherapy. Searching to design an image-guided nanocarrier to deliver selectively Pt(IV) prodrugs to tumors expressing the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), we have synthesized small core AuNPs carrying a thiolated DOTA derivative, a GRPR-targeting bombesin analog (BBN[7-14]) and a Pt(IV) prodrug attached to the AuNPs without (AuNP-BBN-Pt1) or with a PEGylated linker (AuNP-BBN-Pt2 and AuNP-BBN-Pt3). In the GRPR+ prostate cancer PC3 cell line, the cytotoxic activity of the designed AuNP-BBN-Pt nanoparticles is strongly influenced by the presence of the PEGylated linker. Thus, AuNP-BBN-Pt1 displayed the lowest IC50 value (9.3 ± 2.3 µM of Pt), which is comparable to that exhibited by cisplatin in the same cell line. In contrast, AuNP-BBN-Pt1 showed an IC50 value of 97 ± 18 µM of Pt in the non-tumoral RWPE-1 prostate cells with a much higher selective index (SI) towards PC3 cells (SI = 10) when compared with cisplatin (SI = 1.3). The AuNPs were also successfully labeled with 67Ga and the resulting 67Ga-AuNP-BBN-Pt were used to assess their cellular uptake in PC3 cells, with AuNP-BBN-Pt1 also displaying the highest cellular internalization. Finally, intratumoral administration of 67Ga-AuNP-BBN-Pt1 in a PC3 tumor-bearing mice showed a prolonged retention of the nanoparticle compared to that of cisplatin, with optimal in vivo stability and 20% of the injected platinum remaining in the tumor after 72 h post-injection. Furthermore, microSPECT imaging studies confirmed the uptake and considerable retention of the 67Ga-labeled AuNPs in the tumors.

Patients were divided into the ARVUS and non-ARVUS groups, and propensity score matching was performed. Patients were evaluated by the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Incontinence Modular Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF), QOL index, and number of pads used before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after RARP.  Results:   The number of patients in the ARVUS and non-ARVUS group were 41 and 41, respectively. On cystography, the distance of the symphysis pubis to the bladder neck was significantly shorter (p<0.001) and the posterior urethrovesical angle was significantly smaller in the AUVUS group (p<0.001). In the ICIQ-SF, the ARVUS group was significantly better at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. In the IPSS, the ARVUS group was significantly better than the non-ARVUS group at 3 months postoperatively. In a multivariable analysis, membranous urethral length [odds ratio (OR)=3.44, p=0.015] and ARVUS (OR=2.72, p=0.046) were significant factors in achieving 0 pads and total ICIQ-SF Question 1 and 2 scores of ≤2 at 12 months postoperatively.  Conclusion:   ARVUS improved urinary symptoms and QOL. ARVUS seems to be a useful surgical procedure for non- nerve-sparing RARP.""","""['Katsuya Hikita', 'Masashi Honda', 'Ryutaro Shimizu', 'Ryoma Nishikawa', 'Shogo Teraoka', 'Yusuke Kimura', 'Noriya Yamaguchi', 'Hideto Iwamoto', 'Shuichi Morizane', 'Atsushi Takenaka']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""In Vivo""","""['Advanced Reconstruction of Vesicourethral Support (ARVUS) during Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: One-year Functional Outcomes in a Two-group Randomised Controlled Trial.', 'Longitudinal, 5-year long-term outcomes for urinary continence and quality of life after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy in Japanese patients.', 'Advanced Reconstruction of Vesicourethral Support (ARVUS) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: first independent evaluation and review of other factors influencing 1\xa0year continence outcomes.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting urinary continence recovery after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Anatomic and technical considerations for optimizing recovery of urinary function during robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy.']"""

Our objective is to demonstrate that detectable changes in health-related quality of life measured by the bowel and urinary domains of the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-50) were not substantially worse than baseline scores.  Methods and materials:   NRG Oncology's RTOG 0938 is a nonblinded randomized phase 2 study of National Comprehensive Cancer Network low-risk prostate cancer in which each arm is compared with a historical control. Patients were randomized to 5 fractions (7.25 Gy in 2 week and a day [twice a week]) or 12 fractions (4.3Gy in 2.5 weeks [5 times a week]). Secondary objectives assessed patient-reported toxicity at 5 years using the EPIC. Chi-square tests were used to assess the proportion of patients with a deterioration from baseline of >5 points for bowel, >2 points for urinary, and >11 points for sexual score.  Results:   The study enrolled 127 patients to 5 fractions (121 eligible) and 128 patients to 12 fractions (125 eligible). The median follow-up for all patients at the time of analysis was 5.38 years. The 5-year frequency for >5 point change in bowel score were 38.4% (P = .27) and 23.4% (P = 0.98) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. The 5-year frequencies for >2 point change in urinary score were 46.6% (P = .15) and 36.4% (P = .70) for 5 and 12 fractions, respectively. For 5 fractions, 49.3% (P = .007) of patients had a drop in 5-year EPIC-50 sexual score of ≥11 points; for 12 fractions, 54% (P < .001) of patients had a drop in 5-year EPIC-50 sexual score of ≥11 points. Disease-free survival at 5 years is 89.6% (95% CI: 84.0-95.2) in the 5-fraction arm and 92.3% (95% CI: 87.4-97.1) in the 12-fraction arm. There was no late grade 4 or 5 treatment-related urinary or bowel toxicity.  Conclusions:   This study confirms that, based on long-term changes in bowel and urinary domains and toxicity, the 5- and 12-fraction regimens are well tolerated.

Methods:   This is a population-based retrospective study with a matched control identified 8465 adults with an MH ICD code, an initial negative urinary malignancy work-up of cystoscopy and CT urography, and at least 35 months of clinical care. 8465 hematuria naïve controls were age, gender, and smoking status matched. Subsequent coding of non-prostatic urinary cancer, or any following hematuria codes: additional microscopic unspecified or unspecified hematuria, and gross hematuria was obtained. Χ2 tests were performed.  Results:   There was no statistically significant difference in urinary malignancy rates (p > 0.05).

All patients were biopsy-naïve and had suspicion of prostate cancer (PCa) with PSA level in 4-20 ng/ml and a normal digital rectal exam. Univariable and stepwise forward multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluated the risk factors. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of different cut-off value of PHI were calculated for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (CSPCa).  Results:   The overall patient's mean age was 65.65 ± 9.55 years, median PSA was 7.68 (5.28-12.07) ng/ml and median PHI was 43.80 (33.09-64.69). PCa was identified in 32.61% (30/92) of PI-RADS 3 and CSPCa was identified in 28.26% (26/92) of PI-RADS 3. The risk factors for detecting PCa and CSPCa in multivariable regression analysis were age and PHI. When the biopsy was restricted to those PHI ≥ 43.5, 42.39% unnecessary biopsied could avoid.

Here we investigate utilization patterns of genetic testing among a contemporary cohort of men with advanced prostate cancer at our institution.  Methods:   We queried the Northwestern Electronic Data Warehouse from January 2021 to present for all men diagnosed with National Comprehensive Cancer Network high-risk/very high-risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer. Patients were excluded from analyses if treated at an outside institution and/or presented for a second opinion evaluation. Statistics were performed using t-test, Chi-squared test, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression with significance defined as p < 0.05.  Results:   Atotal of 320 men (52.5%) had local/regional disease and 290 (47.5%) had metastatic disease, 53 (18.3%) of whom had castrate resistant prostate cancer. Rates of germline genetic testing rate were low in patients with localized disease (9.4%) and metastatic disease (34.1%). Only 19 (35.8%) men diagnosed with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer underwent germline genetic evaluation. Germline testing was most frequently discussed or ordered by medical oncologists (52%) followed by urologists (20%). Men who underwent germline testing were younger (p < 0.001), more likely to have Medicaid or private insurance (p = 0.002), and more likely to have metastatic disease (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in baseline PSA, ethnicity, race, or castration sensitivity status. Age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91-0.97, p < 0.001) and metastatic disease (OR: 5.71, 95% CI: 3.63-9.22, p < 0.001) were significant independent predictors of genetic testing on multivariable logistic regression.  Conclusions:   Here we report that utilization of genetic testing is associated with metastatic disease and inversely associated with age. Overall, utilization rates of genetic testing remain low in all patient groups, including in the metastatic castrate resistant setting, where genetic testing can identify patients with homologous recombination repair deficiency who may benefit from use of targeted therapeutics such as PARP inhibitors.

This study aims to compare the cost and cancer detection rate of two different biopsy protocols: 6-core transrectal (TR) approach, and transperineal (TP) saturation biopsy.  Methods:   In this descriptive, retrospective study, we selected all prostate biopsies received by the diagnostic pathology department of a tertiary hospital in Malaysia in the year 2020, from adult patients for analysis. Data on demographics, specimen preparation processes, and final histopathological diagnosis was extracted from the Laboratory Information System (LIS). The cost incurred for each biopsy diagnosed as cancer was calculated with the cost prices referenced from laboratory documentation. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 28.  Results:   The total cost for detection of cancer using TR biopsy ranged from RM11.22 - RM271.02 with mean of RM47.53. The standard deviation, s is RM43.45. For TP biopsies, the total cost ranged from RM112.20 - RM349.56 with mean of RM160.85, standard deviation of RM80.37.

Apelin is an endogenous peptide identified as the ligand of the G protein-associated apelin receptor. Apelin and apelin receptor have many tissues distribution and they participate in pathological processes, such as cancer. Apelin stimulates cancer angiogenesis. However, there are insufficient data in the literature regarding the role of apelin/apelin receptor in normal tissue, highgrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic adenocarcinoma tissues. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the apelin and apelin receptor expression levels in tissues of normal prostate tissue, high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic adenocarcinoma.  Materials and methods:   In this study, 38 samples of patients undergoing radical prostatectomy were used. Among 38 samples; 20 patients were with prostatic adenocarcinoma, 18 patients were with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adjacent normal prostatic tissue areas. The immunolocalisation of apelin and apelin receptor in these tissues were determined immunohistochemically.  Results:   Apelin and apelin receptor expressions were higher in prostatic adenocarcinoma than normal prostate tissue and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Apelin receptor expression was also increased in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia compared to normal tissue.  Conclusion:   Apelin and apelin receptor are increase in the process of prostate carcinogenesis. This increase may adversely affect the clinical course of prostate cancer patients by stimulating angiogenesis, which is important for invasion and metastasis in prostate cancer.""","""['H Soylu', 'B Unal', 'K Aksu', 'S Avci', 'A E Caylan', 'I Ustunel I']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Malays J Pathol""","""['Reduced annexin II protein expression in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer.', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor expression and capillary architecture in high-grade PIN and prostate cancer in untreated and androgen-ablated patients.', 'Lymphatic vessel density in the normal-looking columnar epithelium adjacent to and distant from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer assessed in whole-mount sections.', 'Intraductal Carcinoma of the Prostate: Morphologic Features, Differential Diagnoses, Significance, and Reporting Practices.', 'Role of Apelin/APJ axis in cancer development and progression.']"""

Accumulating evidence shows that pyroptosis plays a crucial role in the invasion, metastasis, and proliferation of tumor cells, thus affecting the prognosis of tumors and therapeutic effects. Prostate cancer (PCa), a common malignancy among men, is associated with inflammation. Pathophysiological effects of pyroptosis on tumor development and progression, as well as the mediation of PCa, are known, but its effects on the potential prognosis for PCa warrant in-depth investigation. Herein, we built a risk model of six pyroptosis-related genes and verified their predictive abilities for prognostic and therapeutic effects. Higher risk scores indicated a higher probability of biochemical recurrence (BCR), higher immune infiltration, and worsened clinicopathological features. To derive scientific and reliable predictions for BCR in patients having PCa, the findings of the current study were verified in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohort following evaluation in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Additionally, after evaluating the six genes in the model, ZDHHC1 was found to be an important component.

The availability of big data and the increasing numbers of AI algorithms approved by the US Food and Drug Administration together will help in improving the quality of care for patients and in overcoming human fatigue barriers. In oncology practice, patients and providers rely on the interpretation of radiologists when making clinical decisions; however, there is considerable variability among readers, and in particular for prostate imaging. AI represents an emerging solution to this problem, for which it can provide a much-needed form of standardization. The diagnostic performance of AI alone in comparison to a combination of an AI framework and radiologist assessment for evaluation of prostate imaging has yet to be explored. Here, we compare the performance of radiologists alone versus a combination of radiologists aided by a modern computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) AI system. We show that the radiologist-CAD combination demonstrates superior sensitivity and specificity in comparison to both radiologists alone and AI alone. Our findings demonstrate that a radiologist + AI combination could perform best for detection of prostate cancer lesions. A hybrid technology-human system could leverage the benefits of AI in improving radiologist performance while also reducing physician workload, minimizing burnout, and enhancing the quality of patient care.

Patients with primary metastatic disease are staged using PSMA-PET/CT imaging, while previously published randomized clinical trials relied on conventional imaging (i.e., bone scintigraphy (BS) results. The aim of this study was to compare the ability of bone metastatic lesion detection and changes in staging for 18F-PSMA-PET/CT versus BS in high-risk PCa patients.  Methods:   79 patients with high-risk PCa were prospectively staged using BS and subsequent 18F-PSMA-PET/CT before initial therapy. Patients who presented with a BS showing no metastases represented Group 1, and patients with a BS showing low-volume disease according to the CHAARTED criteria (<4 bone metastases, no metastases outside vertebral column or pelvis and no visceral metastases) represented Group 2. Metastatic risk group according to CHAARTED and treatment strategies based on both imaging modalities were assessed.  Results:   A change of CHAARTED risk group was observed in 9/70 (12.8%) of patients in Group 1. In Group 2, a change of risk group was found in 66.7% of patients, due to either upstaging (4/9 patients (44.4%)) and downstaging (2/9 patients (22.2%)). Treatment changes due to use of a different imaging modality occurred in almost 20% of patients.  Conclusion:   In patients with negative for cancer results on BS, upstaging on 18F-PSMA-PET/CT occurred only infrequently.

This study aimed to explore the value of a novel functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, namely amide proton transfer (APT)-weighted MRI, combined with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels to differentiate malignant prostate lesions from benign prostate lesions.  Methods:   Data of patients who underwent prostate examinations at Chongqing University Cancer Hospital between July 2019 and March 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), APT, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI. Two radiologists analyzed the images independently. The ability of the quantitative parameters alone or in different combinations in differentiating malignant prostate lesions from benign prostate lesions were compared by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. According to the DeLong test, the combined parameters were significantly different from the corresponding single parameter (P < 0.05).  Results:   A total of 79 patients were finally enrolled, including 52 patients in the malignant group and 27 patients in the benign group.

Defining acute stress response mechanisms that alleviate ARPI stress and therefore mediate prostate cancer (PCa) treatment resistance will help improve therapeutic outcomes of patients treated with ARPI. We identified the up-regulation of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in response to acute ARPI stress, which persisted in castration-resistant PCa (CRPC); previously undefined in PCa. CMA is a selective protein degradation pathway and a key stress response mechanism up-regulated under several stress stimuli, including metabolic stress. Through selective protein degradation, CMA orchestrates the cellular stress response by regulating cellular pathways through selective proteome remodeling. Through broad-spectrum proteomic analysis, CMA coordinates metabolic reprogramming of PCa cells to sustain PCa growth and survival during ARPI; through the upregulation of mTORC1 signaling and pathways associated with PCa biosynthesis and energetics. This not only promoted PCa growth during ARPI, but also promoted the emergence of CRPC in-vivo. During CMA inhibition, PCa metabolism is compromised, leading to ATP depletion, resulting in a profound anti-proliferative effect on PCa cells, and is enhanced when combined with ARPI. Furthermore, CMA inhibition prevented in-vivo tumour formation, and also re-sensitized enzalutamide-resistant cell lines in-vitro. The profound anti-proliferative effect of CMA inhibition was attributed to cell cycle arrest mediated through p53 transcriptional repression of E2F target genes.

Results:   Survey response rate was 29% (59/201) consisting of 85% MD/DO and 15% APP respondents. All clinicians surveyed were interested in CDS (P < 0.001) without significant difference between screener groups. Clinicians agreed most uniformly that CDS be evidence-based. Clinicians disagreed on whether CDS would decrease professional discretion over patient decisions.  Conclusions:   Primary care clinicians are interested in CDS for PSA screening regardless of their current screening practices. Prioritizing CDS features that clinicians value, such as ensuring CDS recommendations are evidence-based, may increase the likelihood of successful implementation, whereas perceived threat to autonomy may be a hinderance to utilization.""","""['Jonathan Harper', 'Trevor Hunt', 'Mouneeb Choudry', 'Ashley L Kapron', 'Kathleen A Cooney', 'Christopher Martin', 'Jacob Ambrose', ""Brock O'Neil""]""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Decision fatigue in low-value prostate cancer screening.', ""Factors influencing primary care physicians' decision to order prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for men without prostate cancer."", 'Development and pilot testing of EHR-nudges to reduce overuse in older primary care patients.', 'Relevance of total PSA and free PSA prescriptions.', 'PSA Screening for Prostate Cancer: Why Saying No is a High-Value Health Care Choice.']"""

It is necessary to analyze the failure cases of RNA activation to promote the application of RNA activation. When we validated the saRNAs designed to induce KLK1 expression, we found that saKLK1-374 can upregulate KLK1 expression in prostate tumor cell lines, but failed in normal prostate cell lines. To determine whether the RNA activation of normal cells is difficult only when the target gene is KLK1, we tested p21WAF1/CIP1 as the target gene in RNA activation experiments of normal and cancer prostate cells. Next, to determine whether the above phenomenon exists in other tissues, we used normal and cancerous bladder cells to perform RNA activation experiments with KLK1 and p21WAF1/CIP1 as targets. We have also extended the time from transfection to detection to evaluate whether a longer incubation time can make saRNA upregulate the target genes in normal cells. Fluorescently labeled dsRNA was transfected to evaluate the transfection efficiency, and the expression of Ago2 and IPO8 necessary for RNA activation was also detected. The p21WAF1/CIP1 could be significantly upregulated by saRNA in prostate cancer cells, but not in normal prostate cells. The expression of KLK1 in bladder-derived cell lines was extremely low and could not be induced by saRNA. The p21WAF1/CIP1 was upregulated by saRNA to a higher extent in bladder cancer cells but to a lower extent in normal bladder cells. Prolonging incubation time could not make saRNA induce the expression of target genes in normal cells. Compared with tumor cells used in this study, normal cells had lower transfection efficiency or lower expression of Ago2 and IPO8. Although it has been currently found that normal cell lines in the prostate and bladder might be more difficult to be successfully induced target gene expression by exogenous saRNA than tumor cells due to low transfection efficiency or Ago2 and IPO8 expression, it is not certain that this phenomenon occurs in other types of tissue. However, researchers still need to pay attention to the transfection efficiency and/or the expression levels of Ago2 and IPO8 when conducting RNA activation experiments in normal cells.""","""['Mengyang Zhang', 'Dongxu Lin', 'Changcheng Luo', 'Pengyu Wei', 'Kai Cui', 'Ke Chen', 'Zhong Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Targeted induction of endogenous NKX3-1 by small activating RNA inhibits prostate tumor growth.', 'Antitumor effect of dsRNA-induced p21(WAF1/CIP1) gene activation in human bladder cancer cells.', 'Promoter-associated small double-stranded RNA interacts with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 to induce transcriptional activation.', 'Promoter-associated endogenous and exogenous small RNAs suppress human bladder cancer cell metastasis by activating p21 (CIP1/WAF1) expression.', 'Development of Therapeutic dsP21-322 for Cancer Treatment.']"""

Overexpression of CDH11 mRNA in bulk GC tissues has also been reported to be associated with a worse prognosis. However, a more precise evaluation of CDH11 expression in GC cells is necessary to establish a robust link between CDH11 and metastatic features of GC. We performed immunohistochemical analysis of CDH11 expression in 342 GC cases, of which specimens were obtained at the time of surgery, with a special focus on its aberrant membranous expression in GC cells. The correlations between aberrant CDH11 expression and distant metastases and the prognosis of GC cases were statistically investigated. Approximately half of the GC cases investigated showed aberrant expression of CDH11 in the GC cells of primary lesions. Aberrant CDH11 expression was statistically associated with bone metastasis of GCs. Moreover, metastases to the liver and distant lymph nodes were also statistically correlated with CDH11 expression.

Compound K (CK) is a secondary ginsenoside with better bioavailability. It is also a promising anticancer agent.  Purpose:   We aimed to evaluate the effect of CK on prostate cancer (PCa) and its potential mechanisms.  Study design:   The proliferation, migration and cell cycle of PCa cells after CK treatment were assessed in various PCa cell lines. Docetaxel was used as a positive control drug. Unlike other published studies, the potential mechanisms of CK (50 μM) were investigated by an unbiased global transcriptome sequencing in the current study.  Methods:   Key CK related genes (CRGs) with prognostic significance were identified and verified by bioinformatic methods using data from the TCGA dataset and GSE21034 dataset. The role of CDK1 in the effect of CK treatment on PCa cells was investigated by overexpression of CDK1.  Results:   CK inhibited the proliferation and migration of PCa cells at concentrations (less than 25 μM) without obvious cytotoxicity. Five key CRGs with prognostic significance were identified, including CCNA2, CCNB2, CCNE2, CDK1, and PKMYT1, which are involved in cell cycle pathways. CK inhibited the expression of these 5 genes and the cell cycle of PCa cells. According to the results of bioinformatic analysis, the expression of the five key CRGs was strongly associated with poor prognosis and advanced pathological stage and grade of PCa. In addition, CK could restore androgen sensitivity in castration-resistant PCa cells, probably by inhibiting the expression of CDK1. After CDK1 overexpression, the inhibition of proliferation and migration of PCa cells by CK was decreased. The inhibition on the phosphorylation of AKT by CK was also reduced.  Conclusion:   CK can inhibit PCa cells, and the mechanisms may be associated with the inhibition of cell cycle pathways through CDK1.

However, there is a limitation that the GPR value loses the locational information of dose accuracy.  Purpose:   The objective was to predict the failing points in the gamma distribution and the GPR using a synthesized gamma distribution of VMAT QA with a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (GAN).  Methods:   The fluence maps of 270 VMAT beams for prostate cancer were measured using an electronic portal imaging device and analyzed using gamma evaluation with 3%/2-mm, 2%/1-mm, 1%/1-mm, and 1%/0.5-mm tolerances. The 270 gamma distributions were divided into two datasets: 240 training datasets for creating a model and 30 test datasets for evaluation. The image prediction network for the fluence maps calculated by the treatment planning system (TPS) to the gamma distributions was created using a GAN. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of detecting failing points were evaluated using measured and synthesized gamma distributions. In addition, the difference between measured GPR (mGPR) and predicted GPR (pGPR) values calculated from the synthesized gamma distributions was evaluated.  Results:   The root mean squared errors between mGPR and pGPR were 1.0%, 2.1%, 3.5%, and 3.6% for the 3%/2-mm, 2%/1-mm, 1%/1-mm, and 1%/0.5-mm tolerances, respectively.

Functional studies revealed that pharmacological inhibition or genetic downregulation of TRPM8 ameliorated hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo.

Our previous study suggested the improved survival of lung cancer patients, mainly female patients, with subsequent metachronous primary breast cancer. However, whether the survival advantages of the two primaries are associated with patients' sex and the specific breast cancer is unclear. Whether male lung cancer patients with another primary may encounter the same survival advantage as female patients is also uncertain. The uncertainty hinders these patients from the potential benefit of lung cancer clinical trial. A total of 343 male lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (LCBC), 1539 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (BCLC), 1181 lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma (LCPC), 7426 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior prostate adenocarcinoma (PCLC), and patients with single bladder/prostate/lung (SLC) cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. Patients were classified into simultaneous two primary cancer (sTPC), metachronous two primary cancer 1 (mTPC1), or mTPC2 groups when interval time between two cancers was within 6 months, between 7 and 60 months, or over 60 months, respectively. Propensity matching score program was executed to match the two primary cancers with single primary. Cox regression and competing risk regression were performed to identify confounders associated with all-cause and cancer-specific survival, respectively. The major cancer-related and non-cancer-related death in the two primaries were lung cancer and heart disease, respectively. Median overall survival times since lung primary of LCBC and SLC were 97 and 17 months, respectively, and incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death in LCBC since lung malignancy was significantly lower (Coef. - 1.24, 95% CI - 1.49 to 0.99; SHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). Among the categorized groups, prognosis values of sTPC and mTPC2 groups were not statically different from that of the matched single lung cancer, whereas increased overall survival time and decreased incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death relative to the matched patients were observed in mTPC1 group (H.R 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.41; SHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47). Similar prognosis of LCPC relative to SLC was also observed.

These results hinted that survival of lung cancer patients might vary with prior cancer history. Further analysis among groups with the two primaries suggested that advanced bladder cancer was not associated with prognosis of patients with LCBC and BCLC. On the contrary, advanced prostate cancer was associated with all-cause and cancer-specific death in patients with PCLC but not in patients with LCPC. Compared with patients with single lung cancer, male lung cancer patients with subsequent bladder/prostate primary over 6 months experienced generally improved survival. These results were similar to our previous study regarding female lung cancer patients with another breast primary. On the contrary, male lung cancer patients with prior primary malignancy encountered varied prognosis: improved survival relative to single lung primary was observed in lung cancer with prior prostate cancer, whereas prognosis of lung cancer with prior bladder cancer was not different.

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of the submitted lymph node specimen of 390 prostatectomies in 2011 was performed. All lymph nodes were histologically re-evaluated and the degree of lymph node degeneration e.g. lipomatous atrophy, capsular and framework fibrosis, and calcifications as well as the lymph node size were recorded. Lymph node degeneration was compared in the anatomic regions of the pelvis as well as in lymph nodes with and without metastases of prostatic cancer.  Results:   Eighty-one of 6026 lymph nodes demonstrated metastases. Complete histologic examination with analysis of a complete cross-section was possible in 5173 lymph nodes including all lymph nodes with metastases. The incidence of lymph node degeneration was different across the various landing sites. Lymph node metastases were primarily detected in less degenerative and therefore more functional lymph nodes. In metastatic versus non-metastatic lymph nodes low lipomatous atrophy was reported in 84.0% versus 66.7% (p = 0.004), capsular fibrosis in 14.8% versus 35.4% (p < 0.001), calcifications in 35.8% versus 46.1% (p = 0.072) and framework fibrosis in 69.8% versus 75.3% (p = 0.53). Metastases were also identified more frequently in larger than in smaller lymph nodes (63.0% vs. 47.5%; p = 0.007).  Conclusions:   Degenerative changes in pelvic lymph nodes are commonly detectable but occur with variable frequency in the various nodal landing sites in the pelvis. The degree of lymph node degeneration of single lymph nodes has a significant influence on whether a lymph node is infiltrated by tumor cells and may harbour metastases.""","""['Daniel Gödde#', 'Stephan Degener#', 'Christine Walles', 'Rosalie Keller', 'Nici Markus Dreger', 'Katharina Graf', 'Friedrich-Carl von Rundstedt', 'Hans Michael Kvasnicka', 'Susanne Krege', 'Stephan Störkel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer: frequency and distribution of nodal metastases in a contemporary radical prostatectomy series.', 'Pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer.', 'Lymphatic spread of nodal metastases in high-risk prostate cancer: The ascending pathway from the pelvis to the retroperitoneum.', 'Histological Validation of 11Carbon-Acetate Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography in Detecting Lymph Node Metastases in Prostate Cancer.', 'Management of the lymph nodes in penile cancer.']"""

This remains crucial, especially considering the advent of novel imaging modalities. Our aim was to investigate the current opinion on management of pN+ cN0M0 prostate cancer (PCa) in the European urological community.  Methods:   Following validation, a 31-item survey, complying with the Cherries checklist, was distributed using a web link from December 2021 to April 2022 to 10 urological societies mailing list. Social media (Twitter, Facebook) were also used.  Results:   We received 253 replies. The majority were Urologists (96.8%), younger than 60 (90.5%); 5.2% did not have access to PET-scans; 78.9% believed pN+ is a multifaceted category; 10-years CSS was marked as 71 to 95% by 17.5%. Gold standard management was stated not being ADT by 80.8% and being RT±ADT by 52.3%. Early sRT±ADT was considered an option vs. aRT±ADT by 72.4%. In case of BCR 71% would perform and decide management based on PSMA-PET whilst 3.7% would not perform PSMA-PET. pN+ management is still unclear for 77.1%. On multivariate analysis PSMA-PET availability related to a lower and higher likelihood of considering aRT±ADT as standard and of considering early salvage versus aRT respectively (P < .05).  Conclusions:   The Urological community has an acceptable awareness of pN+ disease and management, although it may overestimate disease aggressiveness. The majority consider pN+ PCa as a multifaceted category and rely on a risk-adapted approach.

Following undergoing a specifically designed training programme, an online interobserver variability study was performed.  Materials and methods:   117 images from six patients treated on a MR Linac were contoured online by either radiographer or clinician and the same images contoured offline by the alternate profession. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement (MDA), Hausdorff distance (HD) and volume metrics were used to analyse contours. Additionally, the online radiographer contours and optimised plans (n = 59) were analysed using the offline clinician defined contours. After clinical implementation of radiographer contouring, target volume comparison and dose analysis was performed on 20 contours from five patients.  Results:   Comparison of the radiographers' and clinicians' contours resulted in a median (range) DSC of 0.92 (0.86 - 0.99), median (range) MDA of 0.98 mm (0.2-1.7) and median (range) HD of 6.3 mm (2.5-11.5) for all 117 fractions. There was no significant difference in volume size between the two groups. Of the 59 plans created with radiographer online contours and overlaid with clinicians' offline contours, 39 met mandatory dose constraints and 12 were acceptable because 95 % of the high dose PTV was covered by 95 % dose, or the high dose PTV was within 3 % of online plan. A clinician blindly reviewed the eight remaining fractions and, using trial quality assurance metrics, deemed all to be acceptable. Following clinical implementation of radiographer contouring, the median (range) DSC of CTV was 0.93 (0.88-1.0), median (range) MDA was 0.8 mm (0.04-1.18) and HD was 5.15 mm (2.09-8.54) respectively. Of the 20 plans created using radiographer online contours overlaid with clinicians' offline contours, 18 met the dosimetric success criteria, the remaining 2 were deemed acceptable by a clinician.  Conclusion:   Radiographer and clinician prostate and seminal vesicle contours on MRI for an online adaptive workflow are comparable and produce clinically acceptable plans. Radiographer contouring for prostate treatment on a MR-linac can be effectively introduced with appropriate training and evaluation. A DSC threshold for target structures could be implemented to streamline future training.""","""['Gillian Adair Smith', 'Alex Dunlop', 'Sophie E Alexander', 'Helen Barnes', 'Francis Casey', 'Joan Chick', 'Ranga Gunapala', 'Trina Herbert', 'Rebekah Lawes', 'Sarah A Mason', 'Adam Mitchell', 'Jonathan Mohajer', 'Julia Murray', 'Simeon Nill', 'Priyanka Patel', 'Angela Pathmanathan', 'Kobika Sritharan', 'Nora Sundahl', 'Alison C Tree', 'Rosalyne Westley', 'Bethany Williams', 'Helen A McNair']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Interobserver variation of clinical oncologists compared to therapeutic radiographers (RTT) prostate contours on T2 weighted MRI.', 'Comparison of prostate delineation on multimodality imaging for MR-guided radiotherapy.', 'Therapeutic Radiographers at the Helm: Moving Towards Radiographer-Led MR-Guided Radiotherapy.', 'MRI-GUIDED RADIOTHERAPY FOR PROSTATE CANCER: A NEW PARADIGM.', 'A Review of the Metrics Used to Assess Auto-Contouring Systems in Radiotherapy.', 'Practice-based training strategy for therapist-driven prostate MR-Linac adaptive radiotherapy.']"""

AR is a critical driver and mediator of resistance of prostate cancer but currently available noninvasive prostate cancer biomarkers to monitor AR activity are discordant with downstream AR pathway activity. External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) remains a common treatment for all stages of prostate cancer, and DNA damage induced by EBRT upregulates AR pathway activity to promote therapeutic resistance. [89Zr]11B6-PET is a novel modality targeting prostate-specific protein human kallikrein 2 (hK2), which is a surrogate biomarker for AR activity. Here, we studied whether [89Zr]11B6-PET can accurately assess EBRT-induced AR activity.Genetic and human prostate cancer mouse models received EBRT (2-50 Gy) and treatment response was monitored by [89Zr]11B6-PET/CT. Radiotracer uptake and expression of AR and AR target genes was quantified in resected tissue.EBRT increased AR pathway activity and [89Zr]11B6 uptake in LNCaP-AR and 22RV1 tumors. EBRT increased prostate-specific [89Zr]11B6 uptake in prostate cancer-bearing mice (Hi-Myc x Pb_KLK2) with no significant changes in uptake in healthy (Pb_KLK2) mice, and this correlated with hK2 protein levels.  Implications:   hK2 expression in prostate cancer tissue is a proxy of EBRT-induced AR activity that can noninvasively be detected using [89Zr]11B6-PET; further clinical evaluation of hK2-PET for monitoring response and development of resistance to EBRT in real time is warranted.""","""['Claire M Storey', 'Mohamed Altai', 'Mesude Bicak', 'Darren R Veach', 'Katharina Lückerath', 'Gabriel Adrian', 'Michael R McDevitt', 'Teja Kalidindi', 'Julie E Park', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Diane Abou', 'Wahed Zedan', 'Norbert Peekhaus', 'Robert J Klein', 'Robert Damoiseaux', 'Steven M Larson', 'Hans Lilja', 'Daniel Thorek', 'David Ulmert']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Res""","""['Internalization of secreted antigen-targeted antibodies by the neonatal Fc receptor for precision imaging of the androgen receptor axis.', 'Preclinical imaging of kallikrein-related peptidase 2 (hK2) in prostate cancer with a (111)In-radiolabelled monoclonal antibody, 11B6.', 'Specific 18F-FDHT Accumulation in Human Prostate Cancer Xenograft Murine Models Is Facilitated by Prebinding to Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Molecular Origin, Expression Regulation, and Biological Function of Androgen Receptor Splicing Variant 7 in Prostate Cancer.']"""

Using antibody arrays, we profiled conditioned media from mono- and co-cultures of prostate fibroblasts, epithelial and cancer cells, identifying secreted proteins that are upregulated in co-culture compared to mono-culture. Six of these (CXCL10, CXCL16, CXCL6, FST, PDGFAA, IL-17B) were functionally screened by siRNA knockdown in prostate cancer cell/fibroblast co-cultures, revealing a key role for follistatin (FST), a secreted glycoprotein that binds and bioneutralises specific members of the TGF-β superfamily, including activin A. Expression of FST by both cell types was required for the fibroblasts to enhance prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration, whereas FST knockdown in co-culture grafts decreased tumour growth in mouse xenografts.

However, low water solubility and bioavailability of the compound are major challenges against its medical use. The objective of this study is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of curcumin-loaded emulsome nanoparticular system, i.e. CurcuEmulsomes, for the treatment of androgen dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cell line.  Methods and results:   The antiproliferative effect of both free curcumin and CurcuEmulsome were investigated comparatively on LNCaP and PNT1A cells. Cell viability data indicates that the inhibition in proliferation of LNCaP cells becomes more effective when curcumin is provided with its emulsome formulation rather than its free form. Corresponding to a therapeutic index of 2.25, Half maximal inhibitory (IC50) and cytotoxic (CC50) concentrations of CurcuEmulsomes for LNCaP and PNT1A cells were estimated as 17.1 µM and 38.6 µM, respectively. The fluorescence signal of autofluorescence curcumin was preserved within the CurcuEmulsomes at 72 h after the treatment. Thus, CurcuEmulsomes prolonged biological activity of curcumin. Induced apoptotic cell death and stimulated cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase were attributed to antiproliferative activity of CurcuEmulsomes. Treatment of LNCaP cells with CurcuEmulsomes increased expression of caspase-3 significantly by 11.76-fold, whereas decreased cyclin D1, Bcl-2 and AR expression levels significantly by of 0.18, 0.06 and 0.46-fold, respectively.

UPR activation is frequently observed in cancer cells and is believed to fuel cancer progression. Here, we report that one of the three UPR sensors, ATF6α, was associated with prostate cancer (PCa) development, while both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ATF6α impaired the survival of castration-resistance PCa (CRPC) cells. Transcriptomic analyses identified the molecular pathways deregulated upon ATF6α depletion, and also discovered considerable disparity in global gene expression between ATF6α knockdown and Ceapin-A7 treatment. In addition, combined analyses of human CRPC bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) public datasets confirmed that CRPC tumors with higher ATF6α activity displayed higher androgen receptor (AR) activity, proliferative and neuroendocrine (NE) like phenotypes, as well as immunosuppressive features. Lastly, we identified a 14-gene set as ATF6α NE gene signature with encouraging prognostic power.

Purpose/hypothesis:   To determine whether a denoised, single-average T2 sequence (T2 -R) is noninferior to the standard multiaverage T2 sequence (T2 -S) in terms of lesion detection and PI-RADS score assessment.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Population:   A total of 45 males (age range 60-75 years) who underwent clinically indicated prostate MRI examinations, 21 of whom had pathologically proven prostate cancer.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3 T; T2 w FSE, DWI with ADC maps, and dynamic contrast-enhanced images with color-coded perfusion maps. T2 -R images were created from the raw data utilizing a single ""average"" with iterative denoising.  Assessment:   Nine readers randomly assessed complete exams including T2 -R and T2 -S images in separate sessions. PI-RADS version 2.1 was used. All readers then compared the T2 -R and T2 -S images side by side to evaluate subjective preference. An additional detailed image quality assessment was performed by three senior level readers.  Statistical tests:   Generalized linear mixed effects models for differences in lesion detection, image quality features, and overall preference between T2 -R and T2 -S sequences. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess reader agreement for all comparisons. A significance threshold of P = 0.05 was used for all statistical tests.  Results:   There was no significant difference between sequences regarding identification of lesions with PI-RADS ≥3 (P = 0.10) or PI-RADS score (P = 0.77). Reader agreement was excellent for lesion identification (ICC = 0.84). There was no significant overall preference between the two sequences regarding image quality (P = 0.07, 95% CI: [-0.23, 0.01]). Reader agreement was good regarding sequence preference (ICC = 0.62).

Methods:   Structured, individual qualitative interviews were carried out with clinical experts to identify what healthcare resources are consumed in clinical practice. To collect quantitative estimates of healthcare resource consumption, a structured expert elicitation was performed with clinical experts using a modified version of a previously validated interactive Excel-based tool, EXPLICIT (EXPert eLICItation Tool). For each parameter, experts were asked to provide the lowest, highest, and most likely value. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were carried out to test the robustness of the results.  Results:   Ten clinical experts were interviewed, and six of them participated in the expert elicitation exercise. According to the most likely estimate, the yearly cost per nmCRPC patient is €4,710 (range, €2,243 to €8,243). Diagnostic imaging (i.e., number/type of PET scans performed) had the highest impact on cost. The PSA showed a 50 percent chance for the yearly cost per nmCRPC patient to be within €5,048 using a triangular distribution for parameters, and similar results were found using a beta-PERT distribution.  Conclusions:   This study estimated the direct healthcare costs of nmCRPC in Italy based on a mixed-methods approach. Delaying metastases may be a reasonable goal also from an economic standpoint.

We aimed to provide a more updated assessment of the extent that US older adults with dementia receive breast and prostate cancer screenings.  Methods:   Using the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Wave 12 (2014-2015) linked to Medicare, we examine rates of breast and prostate cancer screenings in adults 65+ years by cognitive status. We used claims data to identify eligibility for screening and receipt of screening. We used a validated method using HRS data to define cognitive status.  Results:   The analytic sample included 2439 women in the breast cancer screening cohort and 1846 men in the prostate cancer screening cohort. Average ages were 76.8 years for women and 75.6 years for men, with 9.0% and 7.6% with dementia in each cohort, respectively. Among women with dementia, 12.3% were screened for breast cancer. When stratified by age, 10.6% of those 75+ and have dementia were screened for breast cancer. When stratified by predicted life expectancy, 10.4% of those with predicted life expectancy of <10 years and have dementia were screened for breast cancer. Among men with dementia, 33.9% were screened for prostate cancer. When stratified by age, 30.9% of those 75+ and have dementia were screened for prostate cancer. When stratified by predicted life expectancy, 34.4% of those with predicted life expectancy of <10 years and have dementia were screened for prostate cancer. Using multivariable logistic regression, dementia was associated with lower odds of receiving breast cancer screening (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.23-0.57) and prostate cancer screening (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.36-0.96).

The presence of SPOP mutation (SPOP-mutant [SPOP-mut]) may therefore impact therapeutic outcomes with AR-directed therapies and docetaxel in metastatic castration-resistant (mCRPC).  Methods:   This was a retrospective study of mCRPC patients treated at an urban academic hospital (n = 103). Patients underwent tumor DNA sequencing to determine SPOP mutational status (SPOP-mut). Outcomes measured were overall survival (OS) from diagnosis and treatment with second-generation AR signaling inhibitor (ARSI) or docetaxel and time to PSA progression (prostate-specific antigen-progression-free survival [PSA-PFS]) compared by SPOP status using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test. The univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard model evaluated the association of SPOP mutation and outcomes adjusted for clinicopathologic features.  Results:   SPOP-mut was associated with longer PSA-PFS in mCRPC (median 1.79 vs. 0.84 years; p = 0.06) and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-0.84; p = 0.02). SPOP-mut demonstrated a higher median PSA decline compared to SPOP wild-type (median decline 100% vs. 92%, p = 0.02). SPOP-mut was not associated with OS from the start of ARSI or docetaxel (median OS not reached vs. 2.0 years) or PSA-PFS on docetaxel (median PSA-PFS 0.4 vs. 0.5 years) in mCRPC. The majority of SPOP mutations were identified in African American (AA) patients (69.2%) compared to Caucasian patients (30.8%). Race-associated multivariate analysis revealed no significant differences in OS from the start of ARSI or the start of docetaxel and no differences in ARSI or docetaxel PSA-PFS between AA and Caucasian patients. Molecular profiling demonstrated that AA patients had a higher frequency of SPOP mutations and greater heterogeneity of SPOP variants within the coding sequence. Analysis of concurrent genomic alterations revealed that SPOP mutations co-occur with APC mutations (p = 0.001) and alterations in the Wnt pathway (p = 0.017).  Conclusions:   Inactivating mutations in SPOP are associated with better response to ARSI treatment in mCRPC overall. Additional analysis with a larger cohort is needed to evaluate the association of SPOP status and outcomes with docetaxel. Race-associated clinical outcomes and molecular features were observed, suggesting the benefit of biomarker-directed therapy selection for individualized patient subsets in guiding treatment decisions for mCRPC patients.""","""['Andrew Stangl', 'Christopher Wilner', 'Pin Li', 'Lucas Maahs', 'Clara Hwang', 'Amanda Pilling']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['AR-V7 in Peripheral Whole Blood of Patients with Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Association with Treatment-specific Outcome Under Abiraterone and Enzalutamide.', 'Plasma Androgen Receptor and Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Systemic immune-inflammation index predicts the combined clinical outcome after sequential therapy with abiraterone and docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Sequencing impact and prognostic factors in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with cabazitaxel: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Emerging systemic treatment for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a review of recent randomized controlled trials.']"""

Here we report on the use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-radioguided surgery (RGS) during open radical prostatectomy (RP) with ePLND to resect locoregional LNMs identified on preoperative PSMA positron emission tomography (PET). Preoperative PSMA PET showed 78 LNMs in 35 patients undergoing RP with ePLND and RGS between January 2018 and June 2020. In 14 patients (40%), LNMs were located outside the ePLND template. RGS achieved resection of PSMA-positive LNMs in 33/35 patients (94%). On univariable analysis, lower metastatic burden with up to two PSMA-positive LNMs on preoperative PET was associated with better postoperative outcomes. Limitations include the retrospective analysis and the small sample size. RGS facilitates resection of PSMA-positive LNs in patients treated with RP. Our data indicate a favorable treatment outcome in patients with low metastatic LN burden on preoperative PSMA PET.

A variety of approaches to MRI-based targeting has revolutionised prostate biopsies.  Objective:   To describe the procedure and show the accuracy and tolerability of a novel Vector MRI/ultrasound fusion transperineal (TP) biopsy technique that uses electromagnetic (EM) needle tracking under local anaesthesia (LA).  Design, setting, and participants:   Vector prostate biopsy using BiopSee fusion software, EM tracking technology, and transrectal ultrasound was performed in 69 patients meeting the biopsy criteria in two UK centres between September 2020 and August 2022.  Surgical procedure:   Stepper-mounted rectal ultrasound images were fused with MRI scans. LA was applied into two defined perineal tracks and a needle sheath with an EM sensor was inserted. The biopsy needle was directed precisely through the sheath to MRI targets under EM tracking. Biopsies were taken without antibiotic prophylaxis.  Measurements:   Cancer detection (any PCa; grade group ≥2), side effects, and patient experience measures were recorded.  Results and limitations:   Cancer detection in patients with Likert 4-5 lesions was 98% for any PCa and 83% for grade group ≥2. According to the 50 questionnaires returned, 42 patients (84%) reported no or minimal pain, while 40 (80%) reported no or minimal discomfort. No episodes of postoperative urinary retention occurred, and only one patient required treatment for infection. Limitations include the low patient number and incomplete responses to questionnaires.  Conclusions:   This novel Vector technique provides a feasible and tolerable procedure for MRI/ultrasound fusion TP biopsy under LA, with high cancer detection rates. This is achieved while maintaining patient comfort and with minimal rates of complications.

SURVCAN-3 is an international collaboration of population-based cancer registries that aims to benchmark timely and comparable cancer survival estimates in Africa, central and south America, and Asia.  Methods:   In SURVCAN-3, population-based cancer registries from Africa, central and south America, and Asia were invited to contribute data. Quality control and data checks were carried out in collaboration with population-based cancer registries and, where applicable, active follow-up was performed at the registry. Patient-level data (sex, age at diagnosis, date of diagnosis, morphology and topography, stage, vital status, and date of death or last contact) were included, comprising patients diagnosed between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2012, and followed up for at least 2 years (until Dec 31, 2014). Age-standardised net survival (survival where cancer was the only possible cause of death), with 95% CIs, at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after diagnosis were calculated using Pohar-Perme estimators for 15 major cancers. 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year net survival estimates were stratified by countries within continents (Africa, central and south America, and Asia), and countries according to the four-tier Human Development Index (HDI; low, medium, high, and very high).  Findings:   1 400 435 cancer cases from 68 population-based cancer registries in 32 countries were included. Net survival varied substantially between countries and world regions, with estimates steadily rising with increasing levels of the HDI. Across the included cancer types, countries within the lowest HDI category (eg, CÔte d'Ivoire) had a maximum 3-year net survival of 54·6% (95% CI 33·3-71·6; prostate cancer), whereas those within the highest HDI categories (eg, Israel) had a maximum survival of 96·8% (96·1-97·3; prostate cancer). Three distinct groups with varying outcomes by country and HDI dependant on cancer type were identified: cancers with low median 3-year net survival (<30%) and small differences by HDI category (eg, lung and stomach), cancers with intermediate median 3-year net survival (30-79%) and moderate difference by HDI (eg, cervix and colorectum), and cancers with high median 3-year net survival (≥80%) and large difference by HDI (eg, breast and prostate).  Interpretation:   Disparities in cancer survival across countries were linked to a country's developmental position, and the availability and efficiency of health services. These data can inform policy makers on priorities in cancer control to reduce apparent inequality in cancer outcome.

Litchi seeds have shown good anti-cancer activity in various cancers including prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer. However, the activity and underlying mechanism of Litchi seeds against BCSCs remain unknown.  Aim of the study:   To investigate the activity and mechanism of total flavonoids of litchi seed (TFLS) against BCSCs in vitro and in vivo.  Materials and methods:   Two orthotopic xenograft mouse models were established using HCC1806 cells pretreated or untreated with TFLS to determine whether TFLS could target BCSCs in vivo. Mammosphere formation and flow cytometry assays were employed to evaluate the effect of TFLS on BCSCs in vitro. The underlying mechanism was investigated using RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence experiments.  Results:   TFLS could significantly inhibit the viability of HCC1806, MCF-7 and HCC1937 cells in vitro and suppress the growth of HCC1806 cells in vivo. TFLS attenuated stem cell-like properties of breast cancer through reducing the percentage of CD44+CD24-/low cells, inhibiting the mammospheres formation and down-regulating the mRNA and protein levels of cancer stem cells related markers (Oct4, Nanog, Sox2) in MCF-7 and HCC1806 cells. Meanwhile, TFLS suppressed the tumor-initiating ability of BCSCs via reducing the percentage of CD44+CD24-/low cells in tumor and lowering tumor incidence rate in orthotopic xenograft mice. In addition, TFLS treatments restricted the expression and nuclear translocation of Notch3, subsequently down-regulated Hes1 and Runx2 expressions.  Conclusions:   TFLS could suppress the growth of breast cancer and eliminate breast cancer stem cells by inhibiting the Notch3 signaling pathway.""","""['Yunnuo Liao', 'Zhuo Luo', 'Ying Liu', 'Wei Xue', 'Songhua He', 'Xin Chen', 'Hong Ren', 'Xin Yang', 'Dan Zhu', 'Zhiheng Su', 'Qiuju Huang', 'Hongwei Guo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Ethnopharmacol""","""['Total Flavonoids of Litchi Seed Attenuate Prostate Cancer Progression Via Inhibiting AKT/mTOR and NF-kB Signaling Pathways.', 'Combination of metabolomics and network pharmacology analysis to decipher the mechanisms of total flavonoids of Litchi seed against prostate cancer.', 'The expression and significance of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor and its pathway on breast cancer stem/progenitors.', 'Targeting treatment-resistant breast cancer stem cells with FKBPL and its peptide derivative, AD-01, via the CD44 pathway.', 'Role of RUNX2 in breast cancer development and drug resistance (Review).']"""

Additionally, to study the effect of changing ARi vs dose reduction on duration of treatment (DOT).  Materials and methods:   A retrospective cohort study of 333 patients with advanced PCa who started ARi between 2016 and 2020 was performed. ARi medication, treatment duration, reason for DC, stage of PCa, prostate specific antigen, Gleason score, and prior PCa treatments were collected. The cohort was divided into 2 subgroups, patients that stayed on one medication (Group A) vs patients who changed ARi medication (Group B). Student's t test, chi-square test, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were performed.  Results:   At 1 year 28.8% of patient's had discontinued ARi. Reasons for DC were side effects (34.4%), death (34.4%), and cancer progression (18.8%). DOT was 13 months for enzalutamide, 13.7 months for abiraterone, 7.6 months for darolutamide, and 12.1 months for apalutamide. Average DOT for patients with a dose change was 13.4 months, similar to those without dose change at 13.9 months (P = .630). DOT was 12.7 months in Group A vs 19.8 months in Group B (P = .001).  Conclusion:   In our study population DC of ARi is higher than reported in the published trials. Providing patients with an alternative ARi is associated with an increase in DOT while dose reduction is not. It is important for clinicians to understand the causes of early DC to develop strategies to maximize duration of therapy for management of advanced PCa patients.""","""['David Gangwish', 'Bernadette M M Zwaans', 'Paul Miriani', 'Wesley Dejoie', 'Andrina Ajo', 'Connor Ervin', 'Jeff Sarazin', 'Jason Hafron']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urology""","""['EDITORIAL COMMENT.', 'Treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: facing age-related comorbidities and drug-drug interactions.', 'The efficacy and adverse events of conventional and second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors for castration-resistant prostate cancer: A network meta-analysis.', 'The Hospitalization-Related Costs of Adverse Events for Novel Androgen Receptor Inhibitors in Non-Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: An Indirect Comparison.', 'Survival outcomes in older men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with androgen receptor inhibitors: a US Food and Drug Administration pooled analysis of patient-level data from three randomised trials.', 'Comparative efficacy of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors for treating prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.']"""

Unfortunately, subsets of patients do not respond well to such hormonal therapy. We previously identified several pathological parameters in predicting differences in response to NHT of PCa. However, little is known about the potential role and mechanism of miRNAs mediated NHT resistance (NHT-R) in PCa. Here we demonstrate that miR-l42-3p, miR-150-5p and miR-342-3p are the top downregulated miRNAs in PCa tissues with NHT-R. Functional analysis reveals that the three miRNAs inhibit cell proliferation in vitro. Transfection of miRNAs mimics strengthens the inhibitory effects of bicalutamide and enzalutamide to PCa cells. Luciferase reporter assay reveals that CREB5 is the common target of these three miRNAs. Clinically, high expression level of CREB5 correlates with high Gleason score, advanced tumor stage and NHT-R in PCa tissues. CREB5 expression promotes antiandrogen therapy resistance in LNCaP cells and IL6 signaling pathway may be involved in this process. In all, our findings highlight an important role of miR-142-3p, miR-150-5p, and miR-342-3p in contributing NHT-R by targeting CREB5 in PCa.""","""['Xueli Wang', 'Bo Han', 'Baokai Dou', 'Lin Gao', 'Feifei Sun', 'Mei Qi', 'Jing Zhang', 'Jing Hu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Meta-analysis of miRNA expression profiles for prostate cancer recurrence following radical prostatectomy.', 'The survival impact of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy before radical prostatectomy for treatment of high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Genistein up-regulates tumor suppressor microRNA-574-3p in prostate cancer.', 'Neoadjuvant Hormonal Therapy for Prostate Cancer: Morphologic Features and Predictive Parameters of Therapy Response.', 'Neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in carcinoma of the prostate.']"""

However, the function and mechanism of lncRNA DNMBP antisense RNA 1 (DNMBP-AS1) in PCa is rarely investigated. RT-qPCR analysis was used to test gene expression. CCK-8, colony formation, EdU staining and transwell assays were conducted to assess the function of DNMBP-AS1 on PCa cell behaviors. RNA pull down, RIP and luciferase reporter assays were implemented to verify the mechanism of DNMBP-AS1. DNMBP-AS1 was obviously up-regulated in PCa cell lines. Functionally, DNMBP-AS1 knockdown weakened cell proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa. Mechanistically, DNMBP-AS1 sponged microRNA-6766-3p (miR-6766-3p) to regulate lysocardiolipin acyltransferase 1 (LCLAT1) expression. Furthermore, DNMBP-AS1 could stabilize LCLAT1 expression by recruiting ELAV like RNA binding protein 1 (ELAVL1). Consequently, rescue assays demonstrated that DNMBP-AS1 regulated PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion through enhancing LCLAT1 expression.

The Price Transparency Final Rule, which requires hospitals to disclose both the commercial and cash prices for at least 300 services, was implemented to facilitate price shopping, decrease price dispersion, and lower health care costs.  Objective:   To evaluate compliance with the Price Transparency Final Rule and to quantify variations in the price of urologic procedures among academic hospitals and by insurance class.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a cross-sectional study that determined the prices of 5 common urologic procedures among academic medical centers and by insurance class. Prices were obtained from the Turquoise Health Database on March 24, 2022. Academic hospitals were identified from the Association of American Medical Colleges website. The 5 most common urologic procedures were cystourethroscopy, prostate biopsy, laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate, and ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy. Using the corresponding Current Procedural Terminology codes, the Turquoise Health Database was queried to identify the cash price, Medicare price, Medicaid price, and commercial insurance price for these procedures.  Exposures:   The Price Transparency Final Rule, which went into effect January 1, 2021.  Main outcomes and measures:   Variability in procedure price among academic medical centers and by insurance class (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial, and cash price).  Results:   Of 153 hospitals, only 20 (13%) listed a commercial price for all 5 procedures. The commercial price was reported most often for cystourethroscopy (86 hospitals [56%]) and least often for laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (45 hospitals [29%]). The cash price was lower than the Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial price at 24 hospitals (16%). Prices varied substantially across hospitals for all 5 procedures. There were significant variations in the prices of cystoscopy (χ23 = 85.9; P = .001), prostate biopsy (χ23 = 64.6; P = .001), prostatectomy (χ23 = 24.4; P = .001), transurethral resection of the prostate (χ23 = 51.3; P = .001), and ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy (χ23 = 63.0; P = .001) by insurance type.  Conclusions and relevance:   These findings suggest that, more than 1 year after the implementation of the Price Transparency Final Rule, there are still large variations in the prices of urologic procedures among academic hospitals and by insurance class. Currently, in certain situations, health care costs could be reduced if patients paid out of pocket. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may improve price transparency by better enforcing penalties for noncompliance, increasing penalties, and ensuring that hospitals report prices in a way that is easy for patients to access and understand.""","""['Zeynep G Gul', 'Danielle R Sharbaugh', 'Cailey J Guercio', 'Daniel L Pelzman', 'Cameron A Jones', 'Emily C Hacker', 'Vivian I Anyaeche', 'Levi Bowers', 'Ashti M Shah', 'Michael G Stencel', 'Jonathan G Yabes', 'Bruce L Jacobs', 'Benjamin J Davies']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Price Transparency in Hospitals-Current Research and Future Directions.', 'Less Than One-third of Hospitals Provide Compliant Price Transparency Information for Total Joint Arthroplasty Procedures.', 'The Price-Quality Mismatch: Are Negotiated Prices for Total Joint Arthroplasty Associated With Hospital Quality in a Large California Health System?', 'Health Care Price Transparency in Ophthalmology.', 'Evaluation of Hospital Compliance With Federal Price Transparency Regulations and Variability of Negotiated Rates for Spinal Fusion.', 'A Critical Analysis of Obamacare: Affordable Care or Insurance for Many and Coverage for Few?']"""

As both an endocrine and gonadal organ, prostate is closely correlated with androgen. So, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is effective for treating PCa. However, patients will develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) stage after ADT. Many other treatments for CRPC exist, including chemotherapy. Vinblastine, a chemotherapeutic drug, is used to treat CRPC. However, patients will develop resistance to vinblastine. Genetic alterations have been speculated to play a critical role in CRPC resistance to vinblastine; however, its mechanism remains unclear.  Methods:   Various databases, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Chinese Prostate Cancer Genome and Epigenome Atlas (CPGEA), were used to collect the RNA-sequence data of PCa and CRPC patients and vinblastine-resistant PCa cells. Using online tools, Metascape and TIMER, the pathways and immune infiltration associated with vinblastine resistance-related genes in PCa were analyzed. The function of these genes was verified in clinical samples and CRPC cells.  Results:   Using GSE81277 dataset, we collected the RNA-sequence data of vinblastine sensitive and resistant LNCaP cells and found nine genes (CDC20, LRRFIP1, CCNB1, GPSM2, AURKA, EBLN2, CCDC150, CENPA and TROAP) that correlated with vinblastine resistance. Furthermore, CCNB1, GPSM2 and AURKA were differently expressed between normal prostate and PCa tissues, even influencing PCa progression. The GSE35988 dataset revealed that CCNB1 and AURKA were upregulated in PCa and CRPC samples. Various genes were also found to affect the survival status of PCa patients based on TCGA. These genes were also related to immune cell infiltration. Finally, we verified the function of CCNB1 and AURKA and observed that they were upregulated in PCa and CRPC clinical samples and increased the sensitivity of CRPC cells to vinblastine.  Conclusion: CCNB1 and AURKA are central to CRPC resistance to vinblastine and affect PCa progression.""","""['Xi Chen', 'Junjie Ma', ""Xin'an Wang"", 'Tong Zi', 'Duocheng Qian', 'Chao Li', 'Chengdang Xu']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['CDK6 is upregulated and may be a potential therapeutic target in enzalutamide-resistant castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Pre-existing Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer-like Cells in Primary Prostate Cancer Promote Resistance to Hormonal Therapy.', 'The expression of AURKA is androgen regulated in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.', 'Identification and validation of MSMB as a critical gene for prostate cancer development in obese people.']"""

The aspect of cancer-related bone metastasis has undergone a paradigm shift with the transformation of orthopedic interventions for spinal metastasis. We performed this retrospective observational study to investigate the changes in patient status and metastatic spine-tumor treatment over the past decade.  Methods:   We included 186 patients (122 men and 64 women; mean age: 67.6 years) who were referred to our hospital between 2009 and 2018 and were diagnosed and treated for metastatic spinal tumors. We classified the patients into early (81 patients from 2009 to 2013) and late (105 patients from 2014 to 2018) groups. The following components were investigated and compared between the groups: primary tumor, time taken from subjective-symptom onset to hospital visit, primary tumor evaluation during the visit, walking capacity due to lower paralysis during the visit, local treatment details, and post-treatment functional prognosis.  Results:   Predominant primary tumors with similar trends in both groups included lung cancer, multiple myeloma, and prostate cancer. The percentage of non-ambulatory patients during the consultation was significantly lower in the late group (28% vs. 16%, P = 0.04). Among non-ambulatory patients at the time of hospital visit, the mean time from the primary doctor consultation to our hospital visit was 2.8 and 2.1 days in the early and late groups, respectively. In both groups, surgical procedures were performed promptly on the non-ambulatory patients; however, postoperative lower function did not improve in approximately half of the patients.  Conclusions:   Our findings demonstrated that in recent years, patients tended to be referred promptly from their previous doctors under a favorable collaboration system. However, the effectiveness of lower paralysis treatment remains limited, and it is important to raise awareness regarding the importance of early consultation among the general public for earlier detection.""","""['Ryosuke Hirota', 'Atsushi Teramoto', 'Noriyuki Iesato', 'Mitsumasa Chiba', 'Toshihiko Yamashita']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Orthop Surg Res""","""['Surgical results of metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC): analysis of functional outcome, survival time, and complication.', 'Treatment Outcome of Metastatic Spine Tumor in Lung Cancer Patients: Did the Treatments Improve Their Outcomes?', 'Does the Region of the Spine Involved with Metastatic Tumor Affect Outcomes of Surgical Treatments?', 'A systematic review of evidence on malignant spinal metastases: natural history and technologies for identifying patients at high risk of vertebral fracture and spinal cord compression.', 'Postoperative compressive spinal epidural hematomas. 15 cases and a review of the literature.']"""

Site-directed mutation of STAT4 (K350R) enhanced its nuclear translocation and stability, thereby facilitating the proinflammatory activation of macrophages. Importantly, administration of the UBC9 inhibitor 2-D08 promoted the antitumor effect of TAMs and increased the expression of PD-1 on CD8+ T cells, supporting a synergistic antitumor efficacy once it combined with the immune checkpoint blockade therapy.

The aim of this study was to compare the detection rate (DR) of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in biopsy naïve patients with positive mpMRI who underwent FB alone (Arm A) vs FB+SB (Arm B). Secondary objectives were to compare the incidence of complications, the overall PCa DR and the biopsy results with final pathological findings after robotic prostatectomy (RARP).  Methods:   This is a single center prospective non-inferiority parallel two arms (1:1) randomized control trial (ISRCTN registry number ISRCTN60263108) which took place at San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital, Orbassano (Turin, Italy) from 4/2019 to 10/2021. Eligible participants were all adults aged<75 years old, biopsy naïve, with serum PSA<15 ng/mL and positive mpMRI (Pi-Rads V.2>3). FB was performed under ultrasound guidance using the BioJet fusion system; four to six target samples were obtained for each index lesion. SB was performed in accordance with the protocol by Rodríguez-Covarrubias. RARP with total anatomical reconstruction was carried out when indicated. DR of PCa and csPCA (Gleason Score >7) were evaluated. Post-biopsy complications according to Clavien-Dindo were recorded. Concordance between biopsy and RARP pathological findings was evaluated. Fisher's Exact test and Mann-Whitney test were applied; furthermore, Logistic Principal Component Analysis (LogPCA) and Pearson's correlation method, in terms of correlation funnel plots, were performed to explore data in a multivariate way.  Results:   201 and 193 patients were enrolled in Arm A and B, respectively. csPCa DR was 60.2% vs. 60.6% in Arm A and B respectively (Δ 0.4%; P=0.93); whilst overall PCa DR was 63.7% vs. 71.0% (Δ 7.3%; P=0.12). However, in a target only setting, the addition of SB homolaterally to the index lesion reaching a non-inferior performance compared to the combined sampling (Δ PCa DR 3%). Although the differences of 7.3% in PCa DR, during RARP were registered similar nerve sparing rate (P=0.89), positive surgical margins (P=0.67) and rate of significant upgrading (P=0.12). LogPCA model showed no distinction between the two cohorts; and Pearson's correlation values turned to be between -0.5 and +0.5. In Arm B, the lesion diameter <10 mm is the only predictive variable of positive SB only for PCa (P=0.04), with an additional value +3% for PCa DR.

Here we develop a study based on correlating the hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained biopsy data with MALDI mass-spectrometric imaging data of the corresponding tissue to determine the cancerous regions and their unique chemical signatures and variations of the predicted regions with original pathological annotations. We obtain features from high-resolution optical micrographs of whole slide H&E stained data through deep learning and spatially register them with mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data to correlate the chemical signature with the tissue anatomy of the data. We then use the learned correlation to predict prostate cancer from observed H&E images using trained coregistered MSI data. This multimodal approach can predict cancerous regions with ∼80% accuracy, which indicates a correlation between optical H&E features and chemical information found in MSI. We show that such paired multimodal data can be used for training feature extraction networks on H&E data which bypasses the need to acquire expensive MSI data and eliminates the need for manual annotation saving valuable time. Two chemical biomarkers were also found to be predicting the ground truth cancerous regions. This study shows promise in generating improved patient treatment trajectories by predicting prostate cancer directly from readily available H&E-stained biopsy images aided by coregistered MSI data.""","""['Md Inzamam Ul Haque', 'Debangshu Mukherjee', 'Sylwia A Stopka', 'Nathalie Y R Agar', 'Jacob Hinkle', 'Olga S Ovchinnikova']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Am Soc Mass Spectrom""","""['Use of Deep Learning to Develop and Analyze Computational Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining of Prostate Core Biopsy Images for Tumor Diagnosis.', 'Multimodal Lung Cancer Subtyping Using Deep Learning Neural Networks on Whole Slide Tissue Images and MALDI MSI.', 'PPsNet: An improved deep learning model for microsatellite instability high prediction in colorectal cancer from whole slide images.', 'Prostate cancer diagnosis and characterization with mass spectrometry imaging.', 'Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry imaging for peptide and protein analyses: a critical review of on-tissue digestion.', 'Desorption electrospray ionization and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization as imaging approaches for biological samples analysis.']"""

Ribosomal protein L22-like1 (RPL22L1), a component of the ribosomal 60 S subunit, is associated with cancer progression, but the role and potential mechanism of RPL22L1 in PCa remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RPL22L1 in PCa progression and the mechanisms involved. Bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the expression of RPL22L1 was significantly higher in PCa tissues than in normal prostate tissues. The cell function analysis revealed that RPL22L1 significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of PCa cells. The data of xenograft tumour assay suggested that the low expression of RPL22L1 inhibited the growth and invasion of PCa cells in vivo. Mechanistically, the results of Western blot proved that RPL22L1 activated PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in PCa cells. Additionally, LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, was used to block this pathway. The results showed that LY294002 remarkably abrogated the oncogenic effect of RPL22L1 on PCa cell proliferation and invasion. Taken together, our study demonstrated that RPL22L1 is a key gene in PCa progression and promotes PCa cell proliferation and invasion via PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, thus potentially providing a new target for PCa therapy.""","""['Xiaoyu Yi', 'Chao Zhang', 'Baojie Liu', 'Guojun Gao', 'Yaqi Tang', 'Yongzheng Lu', 'Zhifang Pan', 'Guohui Wang', 'Weiguo Feng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cell Mol Med""","""['Identification of candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for human prostate cancer: RPL22L1 and RPS21.', 'GOLM1 promotes prostate cancer progression through activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling.', 'Downregulation of lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 Represses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through Mediating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling by miR-342-3p/CUL4B Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

In recent years, accumulating evidence has shown that β-ionone exerts antitumor effects on various malignant tumors. However, limited studies have revealed the role of β-ionone in regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of prostate cancer (PCa) cells. This study aimed to investigate the effect of β-ionone on the EMT process of PCa, focusing on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.  Methods:   After exposure to β-ionone, cell viability was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the Brdu proliferation assay. The Transwell and wounding healing were used to investigate the migration and invasion abilities of PCa cells. Expression of proteins involved in the EMT process (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin) and proteins in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway (β-catenin, GSK3-β, and p-GSK3-β) were explored by western blotting. The effects of β-ionone on β-catenin degradation were explored by cycloheximide tracking assay and in vitro ubiquitination assay. Nude mouse xenograft model was served as the model system in vivo.  Results:   The migration, invasion, and EMT process of PCa Human PC-3 prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PC3) and Human 22RV1 prostate adenocarcinoma cells (22RV1) cells were significantly inhibited after β-ionone treatment. In addition, β-ionone also inhibited the growth and EMT process of subcutaneous xenograft tumors in nude mice. The study also found that β-catenin, which promotes EMT, was downregulated after β-ionone treatment. Further mechanistic studies revealed that β-ionone inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by accelerating the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin in PCa, thus inhibiting the downstream migration, invasion, and EMT processes.  Conclusions:   These findings demonstrate that β-ionone may be a potential natural compound targeting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Qixiang Fang', 'Taotao Que', 'Bo Liu', 'Weichao Dan', 'Yi Wei', 'Bingyi Ren', 'Yizeng Fan', 'Tao Hou', 'Jin Zeng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Front Biosci (Landmark Ed)""","""['Role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in epithelial-mesenchymal transition of human prostate cancer induced by hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha.', 'Wogonoside Inhibits Prostate Cancer Cell Growth and Metastasis via Regulating Wnt/β-Catenin Pathway and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition.', 'CUL4B promotes metastasis and proliferation in pancreatic cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.', 'Pathological role of long non-coding (lnc) RNA in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway during epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).', 'Cancer chemoprevention through Frizzled receptors and EMT.']"""

However, the effectiveness of these risk stratification criteria has not been fully evaluated in China. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the risk stratification models in China.  Methods:   A total of 140 patients who were newly diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer followed by primary androgen deprivation-based therapy from January 2008 to June 2021 at our institution were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into different groups on the basis of high- and low-volume disease (H/LVD) criteria, high-and low-risk disease (H/LRD) criteria, extremity bone metastasis criteria (EBM), and extent of disease (EOD) criteria. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to compare the validity and net benefit of these models. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we performed univariable and multivariable analyses of the factors influencing overall survival (OS) and the time of progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).  Results:   The median patient age was 72 years. Most patients had a Gleason score ≥8 (102 cases, 72.9%) and clinical T stage >2 (75 cases, 53.6%). The median follow-up time was 25 months (range, 2-95 months). Ninety-two patients progressed to CRPC and fifty-seven patients died during the follow-up. The AUC of OS and CRPC showed that the EOD model had higher validity than the other risk stratification models. DCA shows that the net benefit of the EOD model on OS was better than that of the other risk stratification models. As for CRPC, the net benefit of the EOD model was second only to that of the H/LRD model when the threshold was <0.5; however, when the threshold was >0.5, the EOD model outperformed the other models. The effectiveness of EOD as an independent prognostic variable was verified through univariable and multivariable analyses.  Conclusion:   The EOD model yields reasonable risk stratification for use in Chinese mHSPC patients, providing further evidence supporting its role in clinical decision-making.""","""['Yang Zhang', 'Li Ding', 'Yuxin Zheng', 'Kun Wang', 'Wentao Xia', 'Junqi Wang', 'Peng Ge']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Development and validation of a novel risk model in newly diagnosed de novo bone metastatic prostate cancer (M1b): a retrospective study.', 'Clinical outcomes and prognostic factors in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer initially treated with androgen deprivation therapy: a retrospective multicenter study in Japan.', 'Three-month early change in prostate-specific antigen levels as a predictive marker for overall survival during hormonal therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Hormone naïve metastatic prostate cancer: How to treat it?', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Results:   Significant overall excess cancer mortality was found for Scottish firefighters compared with the general population (SMR 1.61, CI 1.42-1.81). Scottish firefighters were nearly three times more likely to die of malignant neoplasms (unspecified sites) (SMR 2.71, CI 1.71-4.00). Excess cancer mortality was also found for several site-specific cancers, including prostate (SMR 3.80, CI 2.56-5.29), myeloid leukaemia (SMR 3.17, CI 1.44-5.58), oesophagus (SMR 2.42, CI 1.69-3.29) and urinary system (kidney and bladder) (SMR 1.94, CI 1.16-2.91).

We also screened the factors involved in cancer progression, and 11 EGF family members were found to be expressed in the human prostate cancer cell line PC3. PC3 highly expressed amphiregulin, HB-EGF, and especially TGF-α. Treatment with recombinant TGF-α increased the Ptgs2 expression and PGE2 production in osteoblasts, which promoted the formation of calcified bone nodules, suggesting that the interaction between PC3 and osteoblasts promoted PGE2 production. In co-culture of osteoblasts and fixed PC3 cells, the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK and subsequent Ptgs2 expression and PGE2 production were increased, an effect that was attenuated by treatment with inhibitors of EGFR and ERK. These results indicate that membrane-bound TGF-α enhances ERK signaling while also inducing PGE2-mediated bone formation in osteoblasts, thus suggesting that prostate cancer regulates both PGE2-mediated bone resorption and bone formation at the site of bone metastasis of prostate cancer.""","""['Shosei Yoshinouchi', 'Kento Karouji', 'Tsukasa Tominari', 'Moe Sugasaki', 'Chiho Matsumoto', 'Chisato Miyaura', 'Michiko Hirata', 'Yoshifumi Itoh', 'Masaki Inada']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Abrogation of prostaglandin E-EP4 signaling in osteoblasts prevents the bone destruction induced by human prostate cancer metastases.', 'PROSTAGLANDIN E2 stimulates cancer-related phenotypes in prostate cancer PC3 cells through cyclooxygenase-2.', 'TGF-β effects on prostate cancer cell migration and invasion are mediated by PGE2 through activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.', 'Endosomal TLR3 signaling in stromal osteoblasts induces prostaglandin E2-mediated inflammatory periodontal bone resorption.', ""Cyclooxygenase-2-prostaglandin E2-eicosanoid receptor inflammatory axis: a key player in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus associated malignancies.""]"""

While the nasal anatomy and closed reduction techniques of nasal fractures are well described, there is a paucity of data reporting on the need for revision rhinoplasty. The objective of this study is to analyze the factors affecting the outcome and need for revision rhinoplasty in patients who underwent closed reduction for nasal bone fracture.  Methods:   From 2010 to 2020, a total of 417 consecutive patients underwent closed nasal reduction. Medical files of the patients were reviewed retrospectively. The rate of rhinoplasty after fracture consolidation was determined. Factors influencing the need for revision rhinoplasty were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.  Results:   Forty-seven patients (11.3%) required revision rhinoplasty after fracture healing. Patients who had suffered an additional septum fracture were more likely to undergo rhinoplasty. The risk of the need for open revision rhinoplasty after fracture healing was increased for patients complaining of airway obstruction at the time of cast removal after closed reduction.  Conclusion:   A certain number of patients will require secondary revision rhinoplasty after closed reduction of a nasal fracture. Subjective airway obstruction at the time of cast removal after closed reduction is a predictor for revision rhinoplasty. Prospective studies are required to support the findings of this investigation.""","""['Inga S Besmens', 'Charlotte Shahrdar', 'Duveken B Y Fontein', 'Sophie Knipper', 'Pietro Giovanoli', 'Nicole Lindenblatt']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg""","""['Repair of nasal complex fractures and the need for secondary septo-rhinoplasty.', 'Septal fractures predict poor outcomes after closed nasal reduction: Retrospective review and survey.', 'Immediate functional and cosmetic open rhinoplasty following acute nasal fractures: our experience with Asian noses.', 'Nasal Fractures.', 'An Algorithm for the Initial Management of Nasal Trauma.']"""

Perfusion contributes to lung function and can be measured from the determination of pulmonary blood volume (PBV). An advantageous alternative to the current determination of PBV from positron emission tomography (PET) may be from dual energy CT (DECT), due to shorter examination time and widespread availability. This study aims to determine the correlation between PBV determined from DECT and PET in the context of FLA radiotherapy.Approach.DECT and PET acquisitions at baseline of patients enrolled in the HI-FIVE clinical trial (ID: NCT03569072) were reviewed. Determination of PBV from PET imaging (PBVPET), from DECT imaging generated from a commercial software (Syngo.via, Siemens Healthineers, Forchheim, Germany) with its lowest (PBVsyngoR=1) and highest (PBVsyngoR=10) smoothing level parameter value (R), and from a two-material decomposition (TMD) method (PBVTMDL) with variable median filter kernel size (L) were compared. Deformable image registration between DECT images and the CT component of the PET/CT was applied to PBV maps before resampling to the PET resolution. The Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) between PBV determinations was calculated voxel-wise in lung subvolumes.Main results.Of this cohort of 19 patients, 17 had a DECT acquisition at baseline. PBV maps determined from the commercial software and the TMD method were very strongly correlated [rs(PBVsyngoR=1,PBVTMDL=1) = 0.94 ± 0.01 andrs(PBVsyngoR=10,PBVTMDL=9) = 0.94 ± 0.02].PBVPETwas strongly correlated withPBVTMDL[rs(PBVPET,PBVTMDL=28) = 0.67 ± 0.11].

Notable barriers exist, including access to genetic counseling, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket costs. The GENTleMEN study was designed to determine the feasibility of an Internet-based, patient-driven germline genetic testing approach for men with mPC.  Patients and methods:   In this prospective cohort study, men with mPC provided informed consent via an Internet-based platform and completed a questionnaire including demographics and family cancer history. Supporting medical data were also collected. Genetic testing was performed using the Color Genomics 30-gene targeted panel of cancer predisposition genes on a mailed saliva sample. Men whose test results identified a germline pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant received results by phone or telehealth genetic counseling; other participants received results by email with an option for phone-based or telehealth genetic counseling.  Results:   As of August 18, 2021, 816 eligible men were consented, of whom 68% (551) completed genetic testing, and 8.7% (48 of 551) were found to carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in a germline DNA repair gene: CHEK2 (17), BRCA2 (15), ATM (6), NBN1 (3), BRCA1 (2), PALB2 (2), PMS2 (2), and MSH6 (1). Participants were more likely to complete the testing process if they were non-Hispanic White, married, highly educated, or from a higher-income bracket.  Conclusion:   Here, we show the feasibility of delivering germline (inherited) genetic testing by a voluntary, patient-driven, Internet-based platform to men with mPC. Preliminary results show rates of germline DNA repair mutations, consistent with other cohorts. Although feasible for some, reduced steps for participation, more dedicated diverse outreach and participant support, and identification and addressing of additional barriers is needed to ensure equitable access and optimization.""","""['Heather H Cheng', 'Alexandra O Sokolova', 'Roman Gulati', 'Deborah Bowen', 'Sarah A Knerr', 'Nola Klemfuss', 'Petros Grivas', 'Andrew Hsieh', 'John K Lee', 'Michael T Schweizer', 'Todd Yezefski', 'Alicia Zhou', 'Evan Y Yu', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Bruce Montgomery']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCO Precis Oncol""","""['Erratum.', 'Germline Variant Spectrum Among African American Men Undergoing Prostate Cancer Germline Testing: Need for Equity in Genetic Testing.', 'Germline genetic testing for inherited prostate cancer in practice: Implications for genetic testing, precision therapy, and cascade testing.', 'Intraductal/ductal histology and lymphovascular invasion are associated with germline DNA-repair gene mutations in prostate cancer.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Genetically Informed Prostate Cancer Treatment for Metastatic Disease.', 'Recent Research Advances in Double-Strand Break and Mismatch Repair Defects in Prostate Cancer and Potential Clinical Applications.']"""

Despite significant progress in drug discovery, ERG inhibitors have yet to be approved for the clinical treatment of prostate cancer. In this study, we used computer-aided drug design (CADD)-based virtual screening to screen for potential inhibitors of ERG. In vivo and in vitro methods revealed that nifuroxazide (NFZ) inhibited the proliferation of a TMPRSS2:ERG fusion-positive prostate cancer cell line (VCaP) with an IC50 lower than that of ERG-negative prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP, DU145, and WPMY cells). Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1, the critical mediator of parthanatos, is known to bind ERG and is required for ERG-mediated transcription. NFZ blocked this interaction and overly activated PARP1, leading to cell death that was reduced by olaparib, a PARP1 inhibitor.

In a subset of prostate cancer organoid culture and xenograft models, inhibition of Wnt synthesis stimulated growth, whereas WNT5a or a WNT5a mimetic peptide (Foxy5) markedly suppressed tumor growth. WNT5a caused a ROR2-dependent decrease in YAP1 activity, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of MST1/2, LATS1, MOB1, and YAP1, indicating Hippo pathway activation. Deletion of MST1/2 abrogated the WNT5a response. WNT5a similarly activated Hippo in ROR2-expressing melanoma cells, whereas WNT5a in ROR2-negative cells suppressed Hippo. This suppression was associated with increased inhibitory phosphorylation of NF2/Merlin that was not observed in ROR2-expressing cells. WNT5a also increased mRNA encoding Hippo pathway components including MST1 and MST2 and was positively correlated with these components in prostate cancer clinical datasets. Conversely, ROR2 and WNT5a expression was stimulated by YAP1, and correlated with increased YAP1 activity in clinical datasets, revealing a WNT5a/ROR2 negative feedback loop to modulate YAP1 activity. Together these findings identify Hippo pathway activation as a mechanism that mediates the tumor suppressive effects of WNT5a and indicate that expression of ROR2 may be a predictive biomarker for responsiveness to WNT5a-mimetic drugs.  Significance:   WNT5a signaling through ROR2 activates the Hippo pathway to downregulate YAP1/TAZ activity and suppress tumor growth, identifying ROR2 as a potential biomarker to identify patients that could benefit from WNT5a-related agents.""","""['Keshan Wang', 'Fen Ma', 'Seiji Arai', 'Yun Wang', 'Andreas Varkaris', 'Larysa Poluben', 'Olga Voznesensky', 'Fang Xie', 'Xiaoping Zhang', 'Xin Yuan', 'Steven P Balk']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['The Wnt5a/Ror2 noncanonical signaling pathway inhibits canonical Wnt signaling in K562 cells.', 'Noncanonical Wnt5a Signaling Suppresses Hippo/TAZ-Mediated Osteogenesis Partly Through the Canonical Wnt Pathway in SCAPs.', 'Wnt5a suppresses osteoblastic differentiation of human periodontal ligament stem cell-like cells via Ror2/JNK signaling.', 'Insight into the role of Wnt5a-induced signaling in normal and cancer cells.', 'Cell/tissue-tropic functions of Wnt5a signaling in normal and cancer cells.', 'HMGN1 enhances CRISPR-directed dual-function A-to-G and C-to-G base editing.']"""

This study examines associations between rurality and incidence for the top 5 cancers in California and evaluates whether these associations vary jointly by sex, race, and ethnicity.  Methods:   We used 2015-2019 California Cancer Registry data to compare incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and trends for breast, prostate, lung, colorectal, and skin (melanoma) cancers. We leveraged census tract aggregation zones and 7 levels of percentage rural population (0%, >0% to <10%, 10% to <20%, 20% to <30%, 30% to <40%, 40% to <50%, and 50+%).  Results:   Zones with higher proportions of rural population were significantly associated with lower incidence of female breast cancer and prostate cancer, though the trends were not statistically significant overall. Zones with higher proportions of rural population were significantly associated with higher incidence of lung cancer and melanoma. There were no statistically significant trends for colorectal cancer overall. Comparing areas with 50% and over rural population with areas with 0% rural population, the IRR for lung cancer in Hispanic females was higher (IRR = 1.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17 to 1.74) than in Hispanic males (IRR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.72 to 1.11). Also, in areas with 50% or more rural population, the IRR for melanoma was higher in Hispanic females (IRR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.23 to 2.45) than non-Hispanic White females (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.80 to 0.95).

We hypothesized that apalutamide would decrease active surveillance attrition rates through downstaging low-grade tumors.  Materials and methods:   This was an open-label, single-arm, phase II study testing 90 days of oral apalutamide 240 mg daily in men with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance. The primary objective was to determine the percentage of patients with a negative biopsy immediately following treatment. Secondary objectives were to assess long-term clinical outcomes, quality of life, safety, and biomarkers of response/resistance.  Results:   Twenty-three patients enrolled and 22 completed 90 days of apalutamide with post-treatment biopsy. Fifteen (65%) had Grade Group 1 disease, and all others had Grade Group 2 disease. Seven (30%) had favorable- to intermediate-risk disease. Of 22 evaluable patients, 13 (59%) had no residual cancer on post-treatment biopsy. The median time to first positive biopsy was 364 days (95% CI: 91-742 days). The impact of apalutamide on quality of life was minimal and transient. Decipher risk classifier revealed a greater number of negative post-treatment biopsies in those with higher baseline genomic risk score (P = .01).  Conclusions:   The negative repeat biopsy rate following 90 days of apalutamide was high in men with prostate cancer followed on active surveillance.

To better understand patterns of treatment intensification in Canada and specifically how it has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a national survey of genitourinary medical oncologists from across Canada.  Methods:   Using SurveyMonkey, we conducted an online survey of 119 medical oncologists in Canada from January 15 to January 27, 2021. The survey consisted of 16 questions, including demographics, and asked specifically about their approach to managing mHSPC before and during the pandemic.  Results:   Overall there were 50/119 (42%) respondents. Most were male (65%), from Ontario (35%), practicing in academic centers (71%), with 45% reporting their practices focused primarily on genitourinary malignancies and one other tumor site. The majority were in practice 1 to 5 years (34%). Overall 65% indicated their practice patterns had changed since the pandemic, with 51% offering more ARATs and less docetaxel chemotherapy. In low volume mHSPC, the use of ARATs increased from 73% to 79%, while the use of docetaxel remained unaltered at 2%. In high volume disease, the use of ARATs increased from 63% to 84%, while the use of docetaxel decreased from 37% to 14%. Use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) with docetaxel chemotherapy increased by 35%. Post-pandemic, 45% reported they intend to maintain these changes.

The aim of this study is to report on technical and organizational optimization opportunities of the procedure.  Material and methods:   All patients submitted to bilateral intraoperative frozen section from January 2018 until December 2020 (n = 452) were retrospectively analyzed and parameters such as turnaround time, staff situation in the laboratory and histologic properties of the tumors were assessed.  Results:   The median turnaround time per case was 40.3 ( ± 10.5) min. In 2020 the average time needed from accessioning to diagnosis was 38.1 min. Multivariate linear regression suggested that the number of technical assistants/cryotomes (46.1 min vs. 39.13 min; p < 0.001), the place of microscopic examination (43.0 min vs. 38.7 min; p < 0.001) and the presence of a positive margin (38.0 vs. 44.0 min; p < 0.001) were significant influential factors. The turnaround time was independent of the uropathological expertize of the consultant (39.84 min vs. 40.7 min; p = 0.09), the tumor grade (42.3 vs 39.8 min; p = 0.493) and the presence of extraprostatic extension (44.0 vs 39.8 min; p = 0.099).

Five analogs showed high antitumor activity via suppressing the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2, simulationously increasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic genes p53, Bax and Caspase 3. The inhibition of BCL2 led to the activation of BAX, which in turn activated Caspase 3, leading to apoptosis.

Androgen receptor (AR) is the main driver of CRPC development, through its interaction with epigenetic modifier genes, placing epigenetics modifications in the forefront of CRPC development. Comparing the DNA methylation and expression profile of androgen-sensitive and -refractory prostate cancer cells, we describe the epigenetic silencing of claudin-3 (CLDN3) in AR positive cells resistant to androgen deprivation (LNCaP-abl). CLDN3 silencing was associated with DNA methylation, loss of histone acetylation and H3K27 methylation, and was re-expressed by the combined treatment with the epigenetic modulators Aza and SAHA. From a functional point of view, CLDN3 loss was associated with increased cellular invasion. Immunohistochemical analysis showed decreased CLDN3 expression in samples from CRPC patients. Interestingly, CLDN3 expression was significantly decreased in samples from patients with high total Gleason score (≥8) and locally advanced tumors. Finally, CLDN3 loss of expression was associated with worse disease-free survival and time to clinical progression. In conclusion, our findings strongly indicate that epigenetic silencing of CLDN3 is a common event in CRPC that could be useful as a molecular marker for the prognosis of prostate cancer patients and to discriminate aggressive from indolent prostate tumors.""","""['María J Orea', 'Javier C Angulo', 'Ana González-Corpas', 'David Echegaray', 'Marcos Marvá', 'María V T Lobo', 'Begoña Colás', 'Santiago Ropero']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Analytical Validation and Clinical Qualification of a New Immunohistochemical Assay for Androgen Receptor Splice Variant-7 Protein Expression in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.']"""

Human DU145 prostate cancer cells were subjected to 2 kPa compression for 2 days. Compression decreased expression of 2 epithelial genes, 5 out of 13 mesenchymal genes, and increased 2 mesenchymal genes by DU145 cells, as quantified by qPCR. Conditioned medium (CM) of DU145 cells was added to human monocytes that were stimulated to differentiate into osteoclasts for 21 days. CM from compressed DU145 cells decreased osteoclast resorptive activity by 38% but did not affect osteoclast size and number compared to CM from non-compressed cells. CM was also added to human adipose stromal cells, grown in osteogenic medium. CM of compressed DU145 cells increased bone nodule production (Alizarin Red) by osteoblasts from four out of six donors. Compression did not affect IL6 or TNF-α production by PC DU145 cells. Our data suggest that compression affects EMT-related gene expression in DU145 cells, and alters their production of paracrine signals to decrease osteoclast resorptive activity while increasing mineralization by osteoblasts is donor dependent.

One of the key components of the ECM are collagen fibers, since they are responsible for the tissue stiffness, growth, adhesion, proliferation, migration, invasion/metastasis, cell signaling, and immune recruitment of tumor cells. To explore this molecular marker in the content of PCa, we investigated two different tumor volumes (500 mm3 and 1000 mm3) of a xenograft mouse model of PCa with molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a collagen-specific probe. For in vivo MRI evaluation, T1-weighted sequences before and after probe administration were analyzed. No significant signal difference between the two tumor volumes could be found. However, we detected a significant difference between the signal intensity of the peripheral tumor area and the central area of the tumor, at both 500 mm3 (p < 0.01, n = 16) and at 1000 mm3 (p < 0.01, n = 16). The results of our histologic analyses confirmed the in vivo studies: There was no significant difference in the amount of collagen between the two tumor volumes (p > 0.05), but within the tumor, higher collagen expression was observed in the peripheral area compared with the central area of the tumor. Laser ablation with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry further confirmed these results. The 1000 mm3 tumors contained 2.8 ± 1.0% collagen and the 500 mm3 tumors contained 3.2 ± 1.2% (n = 16). There was a strong correlation between the in vivo MRI data and the ex vivo histological data (y = −0.068x + 1.1; R2 = 0.74) (n = 16). The results of elemental analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry supported the MRI data (y = 3.82x + 0.56; R2 = 0.79; n = 7).

In DU145 DTXR and PC-3 DTXR cells as well as age-matched parental controls, the expression of selected ABC transporters was analyzed by quantitative PCR, Western blot, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. ABCB1 effluxing activity was studied using the fluorescent ABCB1 substrate rhodamine 123. The influence of ABCB1 inhibitors (elacridar, tariquidar), ABCB1-specific siRNA and inhibition of post-translational glycosylation on DTX tolerance was assessed by cell viability and colony formation assays. In DTXR cells, only ABCB1 was highly upregulated, which was accompanied by a strong effluxing activity and additional post-translational glycosylation of ABCB1. Pharmacological inhibition and siRNA-mediated knockdown of ABCB1 completely resensitized DTXR cells to DTX. Inhibition of glycosylation with tunicamycin affected DTX resistance partially in DU145 DTXR cells, which was accompanied by a slight intracellular accumulation and decreased effluxing activity of ABCB1.

Applying a quantitative proteomic approach, we analyzed the effects on the protein expression profile of miR-423-5p-transduced PCa cells. Moreover, a computational analysis of predicted targets of miR-423-5p was carried out by using several target prediction tools. Proteomic analysis showed that 63 proteins were differentially expressed in miR-423-5-p-transfected LNCaP cells if compared to controls. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that stable overexpression of miR-423-5p in LNCaP PCa cells induced inhibition of glycolysis and the metabolism of several amino acids and a parallel downregulation of proteins involved in transcription and hypoxia, the immune response through Th17-derived cytokines, inflammation via amphorin signaling, and ion transport. Moreover, upregulated proteins were related to the S phase of cell cycle, chromatin modifications, apoptosis, blood coagulation, and calcium transport. We identified seven proteins commonly represented in miR-423-5p targets and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) and analyzed their expression and influence on the survival of PCa patients from publicly accessible datasets.

We identified three novel non-invasive biomarkers; all with an increased expression pattern in patients (PCA3: p = 0.002, S100A4: p ≤ 0.0001 and MRC2: p = 0.005). S100A4 presents the most informative AUC (area under the curve) (0.735). Combination of S100A4, MRC2, and PCA3 increases the discriminatory power between patients and controls and between different more and less aggressive stages (AUC = 0.761, p ≤ 0.0001). However, although a sensitivity of 97.47% in PCA3 and a specificity of 90.32% in S100A4 was reached, the detection signal level could be variable in some analyses owing to tumor heterogeneity. This is the first time that the role of S100A4 and MRC2 has been described in PC aggressiveness. Moreover, the combination of S100A4, MRC2, and PCA3 has never been described as a non-invasive biomarker for PC screening and aggressiveness.""","""['Maria Jesus Alvarez-Cubero', 'Elena Arance', 'Esperanza de Santiago', 'Pilar Sanchez', 'Maria Rosario Sepúlveda', 'Raquel Marrero', 'Jose Antonio Lorente', 'Jose Maria Gonzalez-Cabezuelo', 'Sergio Cuenca-Lopez', 'Jose Manuel Cozar', 'Fernando Vazquez-Alonso', 'Luis Javier Martinez-Gonzalez']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Prostate Health Index (Phi) and Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3) significantly improve prostate cancer detection at initial biopsy in a total PSA range of 2-10 ng/ml.', 'Comparative assessment of urinary prostate cancer antigen 3 and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion with the serum -2proprostate-specific antigen-based prostate health index for detection of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) is of additional predictive value in patients with PI-RADS grade III (intermediate) lesions in the MR-guided re-biopsy setting for prostate cancer.', 'Current biomarkers for diagnosing of prostate cancer.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection and Prognosis: From Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) to Exosomal Biomarkers.']"""

Since prostate cancer is often dependent on AR, it has become a significant therapeutic target. As a result of the emerging concept of bacterial mimicry, we tested whether compounds with indole scaffolds capable of AhR activation have the potential to restrict AR activity in prostate cancer cells. Altogether, 22 indolic compounds were tested, and all of them activated AhR. However, only eight decreased DHT-induced AR luciferase activity. All indoles, which met the AhR-activating and AR-suppressing criteria, decreased the expression of DHT-inducible AR target genes, specifically KLK3 and FKBP5 mRNAs. The reduced AR binding to the KLK3 promoter was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. In addition, some indoles significantly decreased AR protein and mRNA level. By using CRISPR/Cas9 AhR knockout technology, no relationship between AhR and AR, measured as target gene expression, was observed. In conclusion, some indoles that activate AhR possess AR-inhibiting activity, which seems to be related to the downregulation of AR expression rather than to AR degradation alone. Moreover, there does not seem to be a clear relationship that would connect AhR activation with AR activity suppression in 22Rv1 cells.""","""['Eliška Zgarbová', 'Radim Vrzal']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Four and a half LIM domain 2 alters the impact of aryl hydrocarbon receptor on androgen receptor transcriptional activity.', 'Aryl hydrocarbon receptor-mediated inhibition of LNCaP prostate cancer cell growth and hormone-induced transactivation.', 'A novel prostate cancer therapeutic strategy using icaritin-activated arylhydrocarbon-receptor to co-target androgen receptor and its splice variants.', 'Indole scaffolds as a promising class of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ligands.', 'Indole-3-carbinol induces tumor cell death: function follows form.', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor as an Anticancer Target: An Overview of Ten Years Odyssey.']"""

The activities of acid DNase II and RNase T2, and the activities of nucleases cleaving TLR3, TLR7/8 and TLR9 ligands (Poly I:C, poly U and unmethylated CpG), increased several times in PC, compared to the corresponding tumor adjacent and control tissue, exerting very high sensitivity and specificity of above 90%. Consequently higher levels of hypoxanthine and NF-κB p65 were reported in PC, whereas the opposite results were observed for miRNA biogenesis enzyme (Dicer RNase), miRNA processing protein (TARB2), miRNA-induced silencing complex protein (Argonaute-AGO) and PIWI-interacting RNAs silence transposon.

In recent decades, a significant decrease in age-specific PCa mortality has been achieved by increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and improving treatments. Nevertheless, upcoming, augmented recommendations against PSA screening underline an escalating disproportion between the benefit and harm of current diagnosis/prognosis and application of radical treatment standards. Undoubtedly, new potent diagnostic and prognostic tools are urgently needed to alleviate this tensed situation. They should allow a more reliable early assessment of the upcoming threat, in order to enable applying timely adjusted and personalized therapy and monitoring. Here, we present a basic study on an epigenetic screening approach by Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). We identified genes associated with hypomethylated CpG islands in three PCa sample cohorts. By adjusting our computational biology analyses to focus on single CpG-enriched 60-nucleotide-long DNA probes, we revealed numerous consistently differential methylated DNA segments in PCa. They were associated among other genes with NOTCH3, CDK2AP1, KLK4, and ADAM15. These can be used for early discrimination, and might contribute to a new epigenetic tumor classification system of PCa. Our analysis shows that we can dissect short, differential methylated CpG-rich DNA fragments and combinations of them that are consistently present in all tumors. We name them tumor cell-specific differential methylated CpG dinucleotide signatures (TUMS).""","""['Marcos J Araúzo-Bravo', 'Lars Erichsen', 'Pauline Ott', 'Agnes Beermann', 'Jamal Sheikh', 'Daniela Gerovska', 'Chantelle Thimm', 'Marcelo L Bendhack', 'Simeon Santourlidis']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Identification of novel DNA-methylated genes that correlate with human prostate cancer and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Genomic hypomethylation and CpG island hypermethylation in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasm.', 'Epigenomic profiling of DNA methylation in paired prostate cancer versus adjacent benign tissue.', 'Detection of DNA hypermethylation as a potential biomarker for prostate cancer.', 'Beyond the island: epigenetic biomarkers of colorectal and prostate cancer.', 'Skeletal Muscles of Sedentary and Physically Active Aged People Have Distinctive Genic Extrachromosomal Circular DNA Profiles.']"""

Modulating the expression or function of the MYC protein is a viable therapeutic goal in an array of cancer types, and potential inhibitors of MYC with high specificity and selectivity are of great interest. In cancer cells addicted to their aberrant MYC function, suppression can lead to apoptosis, with minimal effects on non-addicted, non-oncogenic cells, providing a wide therapeutic window for specific and efficacious anti-tumor treatment. Within the promoter of MYC lies a GC-rich, G-quadruplex (G4)-forming region, wherein G4 formation is capable of mediating transcriptional downregulation of MYC. Such GC-rich regions of DNA are prime targets for regulation with Polypurine Reverse Hoogsteen hairpins (PPRHs). The current study designed and examined PPRHs targeting the G4-forming and four other GC-rich regions of DNA within the promoter or intronic regions. Six total PPRHs were designed, examined in cell-free conditions for target engagement and in cells for transcriptional modulation, and correlating cytotoxic activity in pancreatic, prostate, neuroblastoma, colorectal, ovarian, and breast cancer cells.

It has been reported that presence of CTCs correlates with worse survival in patients with multiple types of cancer. Several techniques have been developed to detect CTCs in liquid biopsies. Currently, the only method for CTC detection that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration is CellSearch. Due to low abundance of CTCs in certain cancer types and in early stages of disease, its clinical application is currently limited to metastatic colorectal cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Therefore, we aimed to develop a new method for the detection of CTCs using the Attune NxT-a flow cytometry-based application that was specifically developed to detect rare events in biological samples without the need for enrichment. When healthy donor blood samples were spiked with variable amounts of different EpCAM+EGFR+ tumor cell lines, recovery yield was on average 75%. The detection range was between 1000 and 10 cells per sample. Cell morphology was confirmed with the Attune CytPix. Analysis of blood samples from metastatic colorectal cancer patients, as well as lung cancer patients, demonstrated that increased EpCAM+EGFR+ events were detected in more than half of the patient samples. However, most of these cells showed no (tumor) cell-like morphology. Notably, CellSearch analysis of blood samples from a subset of colorectal cancer patients did not detect CTCs either, suggesting that these blood samples were negative for CTCs. Therefore, we anticipate that the Attune NxT is not superior to CellSearch in detection of low amounts of CTCs, although handling and analysis of samples is easier.

This work aimed to identify the bioactive compounds using LC-MS and GC-MS and to evaluate the anticancer activity of the methanolic extracts of roots, stems, leaves, and flowers from Cladanthus mixtus. The anticancer activity was evaluated in vitro against two cancer cell lines: human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human prostate carcinoma (PC-3), using the MTT assay and microscopic observation. A human normal lung fibroblast (MRC-5) was included to determine the extract's safety for non-tumoral cells. The chemical composition results by LC-MS analysis revealed the presence of 24 phenolic compounds. Furthermore, GC-MS analysis allowed the identification of many biomolecules belonging to terpenoids, esters, alcohols, alkanes, fatty acids, organic acids, benzenes, phenols, ketones, carbonyls, amines, sterols, and other groups. The findings suggest that the majority of C. mixtus extracts have antiproliferative activity against two cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and PC-3, and one non-tumoral cell line, MRC-5. The activity was dose-dependent, and the highest effect was obtained with leaf extract in the two cancer cell lines. Moreover, these extracts demonstrated an acceptable toxicological profile against normal cells. Overall, C. mixtus extracts revealed promising antitumor properties provided by their phytochemical composition.""","""['Amina El Mihyaoui', 'Saoulajan Charfi', 'El Hadi Erbiai', 'Mariana Pereira', 'Diana Duarte', 'Nuno Vale', 'María Emilia Candela Castillo', 'Alain Badoc', 'Ahmed Lamarti', 'Joaquim C G Esteves da Silva', 'Marino B Arnao']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Chemical Characterization and Several Bioactivities of Cladanthus mixtus from Morocco.', 'Chemical Characterization, In-silico Evaluation, and Molecular Docking Analysis of Antiproliferative Compounds Isolated from the Bark of Anthocephalus cadamba Miq.', 'LC/MS analysis of Viscum cruciatum Sieber ex Boiss. extract with anti-proliferative activity against MCF-7\xa0cell line via G0/G1 cell cycle arrest: An in-silico and in-vitro study.', 'Chemical Profiling of Chlorophytum comosum (Thunb.)

To assess the role of SWI/SNF in prostate tumorigenesis, we studied the functions and functional relations of the SMARCD family members. Performing RNA-seq in LnCAP cells grown in the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone, we found that the SMARCD proteins are involved in the regulation of numerous hormone-dependent AR-driven genes. Moreover, we demonstrated that all SMARCD proteins can regulate AR-downstream targets in androgen-depleted cells, suggesting an involvement in the progression to castration-resistance. However, our approach also revealed a regulatory role for SMARCD proteins through antagonization of AR-signalling. We further demonstrated that the SMARCD proteins are involved in several important cellular processes such as the maintenance of cellular morphology and cytokinesis. Taken together, our findings suggest that the SMARCD proteins play an important, yet paradoxical, role in prostate carcinogenesis.

When AR signaling pathway is blocked by AR-targeted therapy, glucocorticoid receptor (GR) could compensate for AR function especially at the late stage of PCa. AR-GR dual antagonist is expected to be a good solution for this situation. Nevertheless, no effective non-steroidal AR-GR dual antagonist has been reported so far. In this study, an AR-GR dual binder H18 was first discovered by combining structure-based virtual screening and biological evaluation. Then with the aid of computationally guided design, the AR-GR dual antagonist HD57 was finally identified with antagonistic activity towards both AR (IC50 = 0.394 μM) and GR (IC50 = 17.81 μM). Moreover, HD57 could effectively antagonize various clinically relevant AR mutants. Further molecular dynamics simulation provided more atomic insights into the mode of action of HD57.

Although androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard treatment for PCa, patients often develop aggressive castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), indicating the presence of an alternative source of androgen. Clostridium scindens is a member of the gut microbiota and can convert cortisol to 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione (11β-OHA), which is a potent androgen precursor. However, the effect of C. scindens on PCa progression has not been determined. In this study, androgen-dependent PCa cells (LNCaP) were employed to investigate whether C. scindens-derived metabolites activate androgen receptor (AR), which is a pivotal step in the development of PCa. Results showed that cortisol metabolites derived from C. scindens-conditioned medium promoted proliferation and enhanced migration of PCa cells. Furthermore, cells treated with these metabolites presented activated AR and stimulated AR-regulated genes. These findings reveal that C. scindens has the potential to promote PCa progression via the activation of AR signaling.

Methods:   We evaluated 123 patients who entered AS with maximum GG1 PCa at diagnostic and/or confirmatory biopsy. TCLo was defined as the total number of PCa locations identified on both biopsy sessions. TCLo density was calculated as TCLo / prostate volume [ml]. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as time from confirmatory biopsy to grade group reclassification (GGR) on repeat biopsy or prostatectomy. Optimal cut-point for TCLo density was predefined in a previously reported cohort and applied to this contemporary cohort. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analysis were used to estimate the association of predictors with PFS.  Results:   During median follow-up of 7.8 years, (IQR 7.3-8.2) 34 men had GGR. Using previously defined cut-points, PFS at 5-years was 60% (95% CI: 44%-81%) vs. 89% (95% CI: 83%-96%) in men with high (≥0.06 ml-1) vs. low (<0.06 ml-1) TCLo density, and 63% (95% CI: 48%-82%) vs. 90% (95% CI: 83%-96%) in men with high (≥3) vs. low (≤2) TCLo (log-rank test: P < 0.0001, respectively). Adjusting for age, prostate volume, percent of positive cores and PSA, both higher TCLo density (HR [per 0.01 ml-1 increase]: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.33, P = 0.005) and TCLo (HR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.20-2.38, P = 0.002) were associated with shorter PFS.  Conclusion:   The previously suggested prognostic value of TCLo density was confirmed in this validation cohort. TCLo alone performed similarly well.

We previously surveyed European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines for strong recommendations underpinned by high-certainty evidence that impact patient experience for which practice variations were suspected. The recommendation ""Do not offer neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) before surgery for patients with prostate cancer"" was prioritised for further investigation. ADT before surgery is neither clinically effective nor cost effective and has serious side effects. The first step in improving implementation problems is to understand their extent. A clear picture of practice regarding ADT before surgery across Europe is not available.  Objective:   To assess current ADT use before prostate cancer surgery in Europe.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was an observational cross-sectional study. We retrospectively audited recent ADT practices in a multicentre international setting. We used nonprobability purposive sampling, aiming for breadth in terms of low- versus high-volume, academic, versus community and public versus private centres.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Our primary outcome was adherence to the ADT recommendation. Descriptive statistics and a multilevel model were used to investigate differences between countries across different factors (volume, centre type, and funding type). Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with low, intermediate, and high risk, and for those with locally advanced prostate cancer. We also collected reasons for nonadherence.  Results and limitations:   We included 6598 patients with prostate cancer from 187 hospitals in 31 countries from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2020. Overall, nonadherence was 2%, (range 0-32%). Most of the variability was found in the high-risk subgroup, for which nonadherence was 4% (range 0-43%). Reasons for nonadherence included attempts to improve oncological outcomes or preoperative tumour parameters; attempts to control the cancer because of long waiting lists; and patient preference (changing one's mind from radiotherapy to surgery after neoadjuvant ADT had commenced or feeling that the side effects were intolerable). Although we purposively sampled for variety within countries (public/private, academic/community, high/low-volume), a selection bias toward centres with awareness of guidelines is possible, so adherence rates may be overestimated.  Conclusions:   EAU guidelines recommend against ADT use before prostate cancer surgery, yet some guideline-discordant ADT use remains at the cost of patient experience and an additional payer and provider burden. Strategies towards discontinuation of inappropriate preoperative ADT use should be pursued.  Patient summary:   Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is sometimes used in men with prostate cancer who will not benefit from it. ADT causes side effects such as weight gain and emotional changes and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Guidelines strongly recommend that men opting for surgery should not receive ADT, but it is unclear how well the guidance is followed. We asked urologists across Europe how patients in their institutions were treated over the past few years. Most do not use ADT before surgery, but this still happens in some places. More research is needed to help doctors to stop using ADT in patients who will not benefit from it.""","""['Steven MacLennan', 'Nuno Azevedo', 'Eilidh Duncan', 'Jennifer Dunsmore', 'Louise Fullwood', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Karin Plass', 'Maria J Ribal', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Daan Nieboer', 'Natasha Schouten', 'Ted A Skolarus', 'Emma Jane Smith', ""James N'Dow"", 'Nicolas Mottet', 'Alberto Briganti;Pan-European National Urological Society IMAGINE Collaborative (see Supplemental material for group members affiliations):']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['The Long and Winding Road from Guideline Recommendations to Improved Quality of Care.', 'Patterns of prescription and adherence to European Association of Urology guidelines on androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer: an Italian multicentre cross-sectional analysis from the Choosing Treatment for Prostate Cancer (CHOICE) study.', 'Variation in the Prescription of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Radiotherapy in the Netherlands, and Adherence to European Association of Urology Guidelines: A Population-based Study.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Methods and materials:   In this phase 2 cohort multiple randomized controlled trial across 2 institutions, men with prostate cancer planned for RT were randomly selected for PSMAgRT across 4 strata: oligometastatic, high risk (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment ≥6 or cN1), salvage post-RT, and salvage postprostatectomy (RP). Primary endpoint was failure-free survival at 5 years, with analysis pending further follow-up. Secondary endpoints included new lesion detection yield of PSMA-PET/CT, acute and delayed toxicities, effect on prostate cancer management, and health-related quality-of-life outcomes.

Male breast cancer (MBC) is a rare disease while prostate cancer (PRC) is uncommon in young men at the age of less than 40. The prevalence of BRCA genes in Asian male patients has to be elevated.  Methods:   Germline mutations screening was performed in 98 high-risk Chinese MBC and PRC patients.  Result:   We have identified 16 pathogenic BRCA2 mutation carriers, 12 were MBC patients, 2 were PRC patients and 2 were patients with both MBC and PRC. The mutation percentages were 18.8%, 6.7% and 50% for MBC, PRC and both MBC and PRC patients, respectively. BRCA2 gene mutations confer a significantly higher risk of breast/prostate cancers in men than those with BRCA1 mutations. BRCA mutated MBC patients had a younger age of diagnosis and strong family histories of breast cancers while BRCA mutated PRC patients had strong family histories of ovarian cancers.  Conclusion:   Male BRCA carriers with breast cancers or prostate cancers showed distinct clinical and molecular characteristics, a male-specific genetic screening model would be useful to identify male cancer patients who have a high risk of BRCA mutation.""","""['Ava Kwong', 'Cecilia Yuen Sze Ho', 'Vivian Yvonne Shin', 'Ada Tsui Lin Ng', 'Tsun Leung Chan', 'Edmond Shiu Kwan Ma']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Breast Cancer Res Treat""","""['BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in males with familial breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.

It is thus essential to understand how phosphorylated RB (p-RB) expression and function are regulated. Here, we demonstrated that RING finger domain protein TRIM28 bound and promoted ubiquitination and degradation of CDK4/6-phosphorylated RB protein. SETDB1, a known TRIM28 binding partner, protected p-RB from degradation through the binding of methylated RB by its Tudor domain independent of its methyltransferase activity. SETDB1 was found to be frequently overexpressed due to gene amplification and positively correlated with p-RB in prostate cancer patient specimens. Inhibition of SETDB1 expression using a gene-specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) reduced tumor growth but accelerated RB protein degradation, limiting the therapeutic efficacy. However, coadministration of the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib blocked ASO-induced RB degradation and resulted in a much greater cancer-inhibitory effect than each inhibitor alone both in vitro and in vivo. This study identified CDK4/6-dependent, TRIM28-mediated proteasomal degradation as a mechanism of RB inactivation and reveals SETDB1 as a key inhibitor of this process. Our findings suggest that combined targeting of SETDB1 and CDK4/6 represents a viable approach for the treatment of cancers with SETDB1 gene amplification or overexpression.

Methods:   We conducted a prospective tertiary single-centre cohort study of a series of all patients (n = 28) - undergoing RARP between January and April 2021. All patients were considered for a day zero discharge pathway which consisted of strict inclusion criteria. At follow-up, each patient's perspective on their experience was assessed using a validated post-operative satisfaction questionnaire. Data were reviewed retrospectively for all those undergoing RARP over the study period, with day zero patients compared to overnight patients.  Results:   Overall, 28 patients 20 (71%) fulfilled the objective criteria for day zero discharge. Eleven patients (55%) agreed pre-operatively to day zero discharge and all were successfully discharged on the same day as their procedure. There was no statistically significant difference in age, BMI, ASA, Charlson score or disease volume. All patients indicated a high level of satisfaction with their procedure. Median time from completion of surgery to discharge was 426 min (7.1 h) in the day zero discharge cohort.

Inactivating mutations in TP53 and RB1 promote lineage variants that suppress the androgen receptor axis and enhance therapy resistance. The present study provides the first evidence that RB1 loss, and not TP53 loss, is sufficient to activate the master regulator transcription factor ONECUT2 (OC2) in mCRPC. OC2 upregulation is common in CRPC and drives metastasis and lineage plasticity, particularly neuroendocrine differentiation, in model systems. Pharmacologic inhibition of OC2 was reported to suppress established human CRPC metastases in mice. Here we show that RB1 silencing in human and mouse prostate cancer models is sufficient to upregulate OC2, at least in part through epigenetic regulation. OC2 expression downregulated TP53 transcription and inactivated RB1 via phosphorylation. OC2 expression and activation in human CRPC correlated with bi- or single-allelic loss of RB1 and inversely with RB1 expression and activity. A small molecule OC2 inhibitor blocked enzalutamide-induced lineage plasticity in vitro.

The identification of biomarkers for DNA replication stress could therefore facilitate risk stratification and help inform treatment options for PCa. Here, we designed a robust machine learning-based framework to comprehensively explore the impact of DNA replication stress on prognosis and treatment in 5 PCa bulk transcriptomic cohorts with a total of 905 patients. Bootstrap resampling-based univariate Cox regression and Boruta algorithm were applied to select a subset of DNA replication stress genes that were more clinically relevant. Next, we benchmarked 7 survival-related machine-learning algorithms for PCa recurrence using nested cross-validation. Multi-omic and drug sensitivity data were also utilized to characterize PCa with various DNA replication stress. We found that the hyperparameter-tuned eXtreme Gradient Boosting model outperformed other tuned models and was therefore used to establish a robust replication stress signature (RSS). RSS demonstrated superior performance over most clinical features and other PCa signatures in predicting PCa recurrence across cohorts. Lower RSS was characterized by enriched metabolism pathways, high androgen activity, and a favorable prognosis. In contrast, higher RSS was significantly associated with TP53, RB1, and PTEN deletion, exhibited increased proliferation and DNA replication stress, and was more immune-suppressive with a higher chance of immunotherapy response. In silico screening identified 13 potential targets (e.g. TOP2A, CDK9, and RRM2) from 2249 druggable targets, and 2 therapeutic agents (irinotecan and topotecan) for RSS-high patients. Additionally, RSS-high patients were more responsive to taxane-based chemotherapy and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, whereas RSS-low patients were more sensitive to androgen deprivation therapy. In conclusion, a robust machine-learning framework was used to reveal the great potential of RSS for personalized risk stratification and therapeutic implications in PCa.""","""['Rong-Hua Huang', 'Ying-Kai Hong', 'Heng Du', 'Wei-Qi Ke', 'Bing-Biao Lin', 'Ya-Lan Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['The established chemokine-related prognostic gene signature in prostate cancer: Implications for anti-androgen and immunotherapies.', 'Modulation of androgen receptor signaling in hormonal therapy-resistant prostate cancer cell lines.', 'A prognostic signature consisting of metabolism-related genes and SLC17A4 serves as a potential biomarker of immunotherapeutic prediction in prostate cancer.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.']"""

Methods:   Men with localized GG5 PCa treated with (1) EBRT or (2) EBRT+BT between 2010 and 2016 were identified in the National Cancer Database. EBRT monotherapy group received conventionally fractionated (1.8-2.0 Gy per fraction) ≥74 Gy or moderately hypofractionated (2.5-3.0 Gy per fraction) ≥60 Gy. EBRT + BT group received conventionally fractionated ≥45 Gy or moderately hypofractionated ≥37.5 Gy, and either LDR or HDR BT. All patients received concomitant ADT; none received chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or surgery. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards in the overall cohort, followed by subgroups based on primary versus secondary pattern 5. Propensity score- and exact-matching was used to corroborate results.  Results:   A total of 8260 men were eligible: EBRT alone (89%) versus EBRT + BT (11%). 5-year OS for EBRT versus EBRT + BT was 76.3% and 85.0%, respectively (p = 0.002; multivariable adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65-0.98; p = 0.04).

Objective:   To estimate the environmental impacts associated with prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   We performed a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of prostate biopsy. Data included materials and energy inventory, patient and staff travel contributed by prostate MRI, transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsy, and pathology analysis. We compared environmental emissions across five clinical scenarios: multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate with targeted and systematic biopsies (baseline), mpMRI with targeted biopsy cores only, systematic biopsy without MRI, mpMRI with systematic biopsy, and biparametric MRI (bpMRI) with targeted and systematic biopsies. We estimated the environmental impacts associated with reducing the overall number and varying the approach of a prostate biopsy by using MRI as a triage strategy or by omitting MRI. The study involved academic medical centers in the USA, outpatient urology clinics, health care facilities, medical staff, and patients.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Greenhouse gas emissions (CO2 equivalents, CO2e), and equivalents of coal and gasoline burned were measured.  Results and limitations:   In the USA, a single transrectal prostate biopsy procedure including prostate MRI, and targeted and systematic biopsies emits an estimated 80.7 kg CO2e. An approach of MRI targeted cores alone without a systematic biopsy generated 76.2 kg CO2e, a systematic 12-core biopsy without mpMRI generated 36.2 kg CO2e, and bpMRI with targeted and systematic biopsies generated 70.5 kg CO2e; mpMRI alone contributed 42.7 kg CO2e (54.3% of baseline scenario). Energy was the largest contributor, with an estimated 38.1 kg CO2e, followed by staff travel (20.7 kg CO2e) and supply production (11.4 kg CO2e). Performing 100 000 fewer unnecessary biopsies would avoid 8.1 million kg CO2e, the equivalent of 4.1 million liters of gasoline consumed. Per 100 000 patients, the use of prostate MRI to triage prostate biopsy and guide targeted biopsy cores would save the equivalent of 1.4 million kg of CO2 emissions, the equivalent of 700 000 l of gasoline consumed. This analysis was limited to prostate MRI and biopsy, and does not account for downstream clinical management.  Conclusions:   A prostate biopsy contributes a calculable environmental footprint. Modifying or reducing the number of biopsies performed through existing evidence-based approaches would decrease health care pollution from the procedure.  Patient summary:   We estimated that prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a prostate biopsy procedure emits the equivalent of 80.7 kg of carbon dioxide. Performing fewer unnecessary prostate biopsies or using prostate MRI as a tool to decide which patients should have a prostate biopsy would reduce procedural greenhouse gas emissions and health care pollution.""","""['Michael S Leapman', 'Cassandra L Thiel', 'Ilyssa O Gordon', 'Adam C Nolte', 'Aaron Perecman', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Michael Overcash', 'Jodi D Sherman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Calculating the environmental cost of care.', 'Re: Michael S.

[68Ga]Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA PET/CT) is a promising target for managing treatment in patients with prostate cancer. PSMA is overexpressed in patients with mCRPC; understanding how expression might change in patients undergoing treatment could determine its potential for guiding clinical decisions. We examined PSMA expression in patients with CRPC and compared PET/CT response with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) variation as a prognostic factor for progression-free survival and overall survival (PFS and OS, respectively). Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective observational cohort study in patients with CRPC enrolled in the PSMA-PROSTATA registry study (EudraCT: 2015-004589-27). A first and second (if applicable) PSMA PET/CT were performed to determine PSMA expression (absence or presence). PET/CT response was assessed as responders (patients with stable disease, partial or complete response) versus nonresponders (patients with progressive disease) by comparing the first with the second PET/CT. PSA variation (increase or decrease from baseline) was assessed across the same time period. PFS was defined as the time between second PET/CT and PSA recurrence or evidence of radiologic progression. Results: Overall, 160 patients with CRPC were included in the analysis. At first PET/CT, nearly all (n = 152; 95.0%) patients had PSMA expression (classified as mCRPC), irrespective of prior systemic therapy. SUVmax was positively associated with baseline PSA levels and velocity (both P < 0.001). According to PET/CT response, median SUVmax on first PET/CT was numerically lower in nonresponders than in responders (17.5 vs. 20.4; P = 0.127). Similarly, patients with a PSA increase had significantly lower median SUVmax on first PET/CT (15.8) than did those with a PSA decrease (30.4; P = 0.018). PSA change was, on average, 146% in nonresponders and -57% in responders between first and second PET/CT (P < 0.001). Agreement between PET/CT and PSA response was 79% (k = 0.553, P < 0.001). Among the 63 patients included in PFS/OS analyses, 76.2% had a relapse and 36.5% died before 24-mo follow-up; median PFS and OS were 6.1 and 24 mo, respectively. PET/CT response, independent of PSA variation, was a significant prognostic factor for PFS. OS was not significantly different between PET/CT responders and nonresponders. Conclusion: PSMA PET/CT may be a useful imaging method predictive of treatment response in patients with mCRPC, regardless of ongoing systemic therapy. Data also suggest that response assessed by PET/CT is a potentially more significant prognostic factor than PSA for PFS. Further studies are needed to understand the potential involvement of PSMA expression on survival.""","""['Letizia Calderoni', 'Elisa Maietti', 'Andrea Farolfi', 'Riccardo Mei', 'Karly S Louie', 'Michael Groaning', 'Stefano Fanti']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Therapeutic efficacy, prognostic variables and clinical outcome of 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT in progressive mCRPC following multiple lines of treatment: prognostic implications of high FDG uptake on dual tracer PET-CT vis-à-vis Gleason score in such cohort.', 'The Prognostic Value of Posttreatment 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and NOX66 in a Phase I/II Trial (LuPIN).', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'How PET-CT is Changing the Management of Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer?: Comment la TEP-TDM Peut Modifier la Prise en Charge du Cancer de la Prostate Non Métastatique Résistant à la Castration ?']"""

While consensus guidelines are available for non-spinal bone metastases practice continues to vary widely. The aim of this study is to look at inter-observer variability in the contouring of prostate cancer non-spinal bone metastases with different imaging modalities.  Materials and methods:   15 metastases from 13 patients treated at our centre were selected. 4 observers independently contoured clinical target volumes (CTV) on planning CT alone, planning CT with MRI fusion, planning CT with PET-CT fusion and planning CT with both MRI and PET-CT fusion combined. The mean inter-observer agreement on each modality was compared by measuring the delineated volume, generalized conformity index (CIgen), and the distance of the centre of mass (dCOM), calculated per metastasis and imaging modality.  Results:   Mean CTV volume delineated on planning CT with MRI and PET-CT fusion combined was significantly larger compared to other imaging modalities (p = 0.0001). CIgen showed marked variation between modalities with the highest agreement between planning CT + PET-CT (mean CIgen 0.55, range 0.32-0.73) and planning CT + MRI + PET-CT (mean CIgen 0.59, range 0.34-0.73). dCOM showed small variations between imaging modalities but a significantly shorter distance found on planning CT + PET-CT when compared with planning CT + PET-CT + MRI combined (p = 0.03).

The VISION trial showed prolonged progression-free and overall survival in patients treated with lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (177Lu-PSMA-617) radioligand therapy compared with using the standard of care (SoC) alone. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of 177Lu-PSMA-617 treatment compared with SoC therapy.  Methods:   A partitioned survival model was developed using data from the VISION trial, which included overall and progression-free survival and treatment regimens for 177Lu-PSMA-617 and SoC. Treatment costs, utilities for health states, and adverse events were derived from public databases and the literature. Because 177Lu-PSMA-617 was only recently approved, costs for treatment were extrapolated from 177Lu-DOTATATE. Outcome measurements included the incremental cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness ratio. The analysis was performed in a US setting from a healthcare system perspective over the lifetime horizon of 60 months. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set to $50,000, $100,000, and $200,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).  Results:   The 177Lu-PSMA-617 group was estimated to gain 0.42 incremental QALYs. Treatment using 177Lu-PSMA-617 led to an increase in costs compared with SoC ($169,110 vs $85,398). The incremental cost, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness ratio for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy was $200,708/QALYs. Sensitivity analysis showed robustness of the model regarding various parameters, which remained cost-effective at all lower and upper parameter bounds. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations, therapy using 177Lu-PSMA-617 was determined as the cost-effective strategy in 37.14% of all iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000/QALYs.  Conclusions:   Treatment using 177Lu-PSMA-617 was estimated to add a notable clinical benefit over SoC alone.

However, it is unclear whether it is a cause of cancer. This two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses, uses genetic instruments to proxy the exposure of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer summary statistics as outcomes, allowing for causal inferences.  Methods:   Summary statistics from 18 common cancers (2107-491,974 participants), gene expression, DNA methylation and protein expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL, mQTL and pQTL, respectively, 1000-31,684 participants) on individuals of European ancestry, were included. Genetic variants located within or close to the 1136 mitochondrial-related genes (in cis) and robustly associated with the mitochondrial molecular alterations were used as instrumental variables, and their causal associations with cancers were examined using summary-data-based MR (SMR) analyses. An additional five MR methods were used as sensitivity analyses to confirm the casual associations. A Bayesian test for colocalization between mitochondrial molecular QTLs and cancer risk loci was performed to provide insights into the potential regulatory mechanisms of risk variants on cancers.  Findings:   We identified potential causal relationships between mitochondrial-related genes and breast, prostate, gastric, lung cancer and melanoma by primary SMR analyses. The sensitivity and the colocalization analyses further refined four genes that have causal effects on three types of cancer. We found strong evidence of positive association of FDPS expression level with breast cancer risk (OR per SD, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.83; P = 9.77 × 10-7), NSUN4 expression level with both breast cancer risk (OR per SD, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.07; P = 5.24 × 10-6) and prostate cancer risk (OR per SD, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09; P = 1.01 × 10-5), NSUN4 methylation level with both breast and prostate cancer risk, and VARS2 methylation level with lung cancer risk.  Interpretations:   This data-driven MR study demonstrated the causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple cancers.

Consistent with observations in human cancers, male mice showed accelerated tumor progression compared with females, but these differences were not observed in immunodeficient mice. Androgen signaling suppressed T-cell immunity against cancer in males. Mechanistically, androgen-activated androgen receptor upregulated expression of USP18, which inhibited TAK1 phosphorylation and the subsequent activation of NF-κB in antitumor T cells. Reduction of testosterone synthesis by surgical castration or using the small-molecular inhibitor abiraterone significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of T cells in male mice and improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Together, this study revealed a novel mechanism contributing to sex differences in cancer. These results indicate that inhibition of androgen signaling is a promising approach to improve the efficacy of immunotherapy in males.

However, to our knowledge, these advantages have yet to be demonstrated in a randomized clinical trial.  Objective:   To determine whether aggressive margin reduction with MRI guidance significantly reduces acute grade 2 or greater genitourinary (GU) toxic effects after prostate SBRT compared with computed tomography (CT) guidance.  Design, setting, and participants:   This phase 3 randomized clinical trial (MRI-Guided Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer [MIRAGE]) enrolled men aged 18 years or older who were receiving SBRT for clinically localized prostate adenocarcinoma at a single center between May 5, 2020, and October 1, 2021. Data were analyzed from January 15, 2021, through May 15, 2022. All patients had 3 months or more of follow-up.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized 1:1 to SBRT with CT guidance (control arm) or MRI guidance. Planning margins of 4 mm (CT arm) and 2 mm (MRI arm) were used to deliver 40 Gy in 5 fractions.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was the incidence of acute (≤90 days after SBRT) grade 2 or greater GU toxic effects (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03 [CTCAE v4.03]). Secondary outcomes included CTCAE v4.03-based gastrointestinal toxic effects and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)-based and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26)-based outcomes.  Results:   Between May 2020 and October 2021, 156 patients were randomized: 77 to CT (median age, 71 years [IQR, 67-77 years]) and 79 to MRI (median age, 71 years [IQR, 68-75 years]). A prespecified interim futility analysis conducted after 100 patients reached 90 or more days after SBRT was performed October 1, 2021, with the sample size reestimated to 154 patients. Thus, the trial was closed to accrual early. The incidence of acute grade 2 or greater GU toxic effects was significantly lower with MRI vs CT guidance (24.4% [95% CI, 15.4%-35.4%] vs 43.4% [95% CI, 32.1%-55.3%]; P = .01), as was the incidence of acute grade 2 or greater gastrointestinal toxic effects (0.0% [95% CI, 0.0%-4.6%] vs 10.5% [95% CI, 4.7%-19.7%]; P = .003). Magnetic resonance imaging guidance was associated with a significantly smaller percentage of patients with a 15-point or greater increase in IPSS at 1 month (6.8% [5 of 72] vs 19.4% [14 of 74]; P = .01) and a significantly reduced percentage of patients with a clinically significant (≥12-point) decrease in EPIC-26 bowel scores (25.0% [17 of 68] vs 50.0% [34 of 68]; P = .001) at 1 month.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial, compared with CT-guidance, MRI-guided SBRT significantly reduced both moderate acute physician-scored toxic effects and decrements in patient-reported quality of life.

However, most patients with cancer die without a documented SIC.  Objective:   To test the impact of behavioral nudges to clinicians to prompt SICs on the SIC rate and end-of-life outcomes among patients at high risk of death within 180 days (high-risk patients) as identified by a machine learning algorithm.  Design, setting, and participants:   This prespecified 40-week analysis of a stepped-wedge randomized clinical trial conducted between June 17, 2019, and April 20, 2020 (including 16 weeks of intervention rollout and 24 weeks of follow-up), included 20 506 patients with cancer representing 41 021 encounters at 9 tertiary or community-based medical oncology clinics in a large academic health system. The current analyses were conducted from June 1, 2021, to May 31, 2022.  Intervention:   High-risk patients were identified using a validated electronic health record machine learning algorithm to predict 6-month mortality. The intervention consisted of (1) weekly emails to clinicians comparing their SIC rates for all patients against peers' rates, (2) weekly lists of high-risk patients, and (3) opt-out text messages to prompt SICs before encounters with high-risk patients.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was SIC rates for all and high-risk patient encounters; secondary end-of-life outcomes among decedents included inpatient death, hospice enrollment and length of stay, and intensive care unit admission and systemic therapy close to death. Intention-to-treat analyses were adjusted for clinic and wedge fixed effects and clustered at the oncologist level.  Results:   The study included 20 506 patients (mean [SD] age, 60.0 [14.0] years) and 41 021 patient encounters: 22 259 (54%) encounters with female patients, 28 907 (70.5%) with non-Hispanic White patients, and 5520 (13.5%) with high-risk patients; 1417 patients (6.9%) died by the end of follow-up. There were no meaningful differences in demographic characteristics in the control and intervention periods. Among high-risk patient encounters, the unadjusted SIC rates were 3.4% (59 of 1754 encounters) in the control period and 13.5% (510 of 3765 encounters) in the intervention period. In adjusted analyses, the intervention was associated with increased SICs for all patients (adjusted odds ratio, 2.09 [95% CI, 1.53-2.87]; P < .001) and decreased end-of-life systemic therapy (7.5% [72 of 957 patients] vs 10.4% [24 of 231 patients]; adjusted odds ratio, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.11-0.57]; P = .001) relative to controls, but there was no effect on hospice enrollment or length of stay, inpatient death, or end-of-life ICU use.

The objective is to assess oncological and functional outcomes when implementing RS-RARP in a medium-volume center without previous experience of robotic surgery. This is a prospective observational single-center study. Patients operated between July 2017 and April 2020 were divided into two consecutive groups, A and B, each with 104 patients. The surgeons had prior experience in laparoscopic surgery and underwent robotic training. Positive surgical margin (PSM) status, urinary continence, and erectile function projected by Kaplan-Meier curves, together with patient reported quality of life outcomes at 12 months post-surgery were documented. Median patient age was 63 years (IQR = 59-67), overall PSM rate were 33%, 28% for pT2 disease. Pre-operative values showed no significant difference between both groups. The rate of urinary continence dropped from 81 to 78% (SE = 5.7) (Group A) and from 90 to 72% (SE = 6.3) (Group B) using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form. Baseline sexual function was regained in 41% (Group A) and 47% (Group B) of patients. The median Expanded Prostate Index Composite-26 total score decreased from 86 to 82. These outcomes relate favorably to prior reports. There was a clinically significant decrease in median operative time in the successive groups with post-operative complications occurring in less than 2% of surgical procedures overall.

To enable magnetosome medical applications, these growth media are reduced and amended compared with media commonly used to grow these bacteria. Furthermore, magnetosomes are made non-pyrogenic by being extracted from these micro-organisms and heated above 400 °C to remove and denature bacterial organic material and produce inorganic magnetosome minerals. To be stabilized, these minerals are further coated with citric acid to yield M-CA, leading to fully reconstructed chains of magnetosomes. The heating properties and anti-tumor activity of highly pure M-CA are then studied by bringing M-CA into contact with PC3-Luc tumor cells and by exposing such assembly to an alternating magnetic field (AMF) of 42 mT and 195 kHz during 30 min. While in the absence of AMF, M-CA are observed to be non-cytotoxic, they result in a 35% decrease in cell viability following AMF application. The treatment efficacy can be associated with a specific absorption rate (SAR) value of M-CA, which is relatively high in cellular environment, i.e., SARcell = 253 ± 11 W/gFe, while being lower than the M-CA SAR value measured in water, i.e., SARwater = 1025 ± 194 W/gFe, highlighting that a reduction in the Brownian contribution to the SAR value in cellular environment does not prevent efficient tumor cell destruction with these nanoparticles.

In 2023, 1,958,310 new cancer cases and 609,820 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Cancer incidence increased for prostate cancer by 3% annually from 2014 through 2019 after two decades of decline, translating to an additional 99,000 new cases; otherwise, however, incidence trends were more favorable in men compared to women. For example, lung cancer in women decreased at one half the pace of men (1.1% vs. 2.6% annually) from 2015 through 2019, and breast and uterine corpus cancers continued to increase, as did liver cancer and melanoma, both of which stabilized in men aged 50 years and older and declined in younger men. However, a 65% drop in cervical cancer incidence during 2012 through 2019 among women in their early 20s, the first cohort to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine, foreshadows steep reductions in the burden of human papillomavirus-associated cancers, the majority of which occur in women. Despite the pandemic, and in contrast with other leading causes of death, the cancer death rate continued to decline from 2019 to 2020 (by 1.5%), contributing to a 33% overall reduction since 1991 and an estimated 3.8 million deaths averted. This progress increasingly reflects advances in treatment, which are particularly evident in the rapid declines in mortality (approximately 2% annually during 2016 through 2020) for leukemia, melanoma, and kidney cancer, despite stable/increasing incidence, and accelerated declines for lung cancer. In summary, although cancer mortality rates continue to decline, future progress may be attenuated by rising incidence for breast, prostate, and uterine corpus cancers, which also happen to have the largest racial disparities in mortality.""","""['Rebecca L Siegel', 'Kimberly D Miller', 'Nikita Sandeep Wagle', 'Ahmedin Jemal']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""CA Cancer J Clin""","""['Cancer statistics, 2020.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part I: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, part 1: National cancer statistics.', 'Annual report to the nation on the status of cancer, 1975-2000, featuring the uses of surveillance data for cancer prevention and control.', 'Cancer statistics, 2004.', 'A green one-pot synthetic protocol of hexahydropyrimido4,5-dpyrimidin-4(1H)-one derivatives: molecular docking, ADMET, anticancer and antimicrobial studies.', 'Identification of host gene-microbiome associations in colorectal cancer patients using mendelian randomization.', 'Lysin (K)-specific demethylase 1 inhibition enhances proteasome inhibitor response and overcomes drug resistance in multiple myeloma.', 'IGF2BP2-modified UBE2D1 interacts with Smad2/3 to promote the progression of breast cancer.', 'Racial disparities in new-onset diabetes mellitus in prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy: a retrospective analysis of TriNetX data.']"""

However, the repeatability of radiomic features on PET has not been assessed in a test-retest setting. The prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted compound 18 F-DCFPyL is a high-affinity, high-contrast PET agent that we utilized in a test-retest cohort of men with metastatic prostate cancer (PC).  Methods:   Data of 21 patients enrolled in a prospective clinical trial with histologically proven PC underwent two 18 F-DCFPyL PET scans within 7 days, using identical acquisition and reconstruction parameters. Sites of disease were segmented and a set of 29 different radiomic parameters were assessed on both scans. We determined repeatability of quantification by using Pearson's correlations, within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), and Bland-Altman analysis.  Results:   In total, 230 lesions (177 bone, 38 lymph nodes, 15 others) were assessed on both scans. For all investigated radiomic features, a broad range of inter-scan correlation was found (r, 0.07-0.95), with acceptable reproducibility for entropy and homogeneity (wCOV, 16.0% and 12.7%, respectively). On Bland-Altman analysis, no systematic increase or decrease between the scans was observed for either parameter (±1.96 SD: 1.07/-1.30, 0.23/-0.18, respectively). The remaining 27 tested radiomic metrics, however, achieved unacceptable high wCOV (≥21.7%).  Conclusion:   Many common radiomic features derived from a test-retest PET study had poor repeatability. Only Entropy and homogeneity achieved good repeatability, supporting the notion that those image biomarkers may be incorporated in future clinical trials. Those radiomic features based on high frequency aspects of images appear to lack the repeatability on PET to justify further study.""","""['Rudolf A Werner', 'Bilêl Habacha', 'Susanne Lütje', 'Lena Bundschuh', 'Alekandser Kosmala', 'Markus Essler', 'Thorsten Derlin', 'Takahiro Higuchi', 'Constantin Lapa', 'Andreas K Buck', 'Kenneth J Pienta', 'Martin A Lodge', 'Mario A Eisenberger', 'Mark C Markowski', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Eric C Frey', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Ralph A Bundschuh']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['High SUVs Have More Robust Repeatability in Patients with Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Results from a Prospective Test-Retest Cohort Imaged with 18F-DCFPyL.', 'Repeatability of Quantitative 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Measurements in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'Test-retest repeatability of organ uptake on PSMA-targeted 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '18FDCFPyL PET/CT for Imaging of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Western blot, RT-qPCR, CLIP, co-IP and RNA pull-down assays were used for RNA/protein interaction, RNA or protein expression examination. MTS assay was used to determine cell viability in vitro, xenograft assay was used to examine the tumor growth in mice. Results: In this study, we screened and identified bone-specific N6 adenosine methylation (m6A) on enhancer RNA (eRNA) that played a post-transcriptional functional role in bone mPCa and was correlated with radiotherapy (RT) resistance. Further data demonstrated that RNA-binding protein KHSRP recognized both m6A at eRNA and m6Am at 5'-UTR of mRNA to block RNA degradation from exoribonuclease XRN2. Depletion of the MLXIPe/KHSRP/PSMD9 regulatory complex inhibited tumor growth and RT sensitization of bone mPCa xenograft in vitro and in vivo.

However, the success of anti-Myc therapy is hampered by the lack of a strategy to effectively deliver the inhibitors to the tumor site and by the feedback mechanisms that cancer cells use to adapt to metabolic reprogramming. Methods: The effects of Myc inhibitors (10074-G5 or 10058-F4), alone or in combination with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), were evaluated in cultured human or murine prostate cancer cells by cell viability assay, qRT-PCR and Western blot. To facilitate the in vivo therapeutic evaluation, a prodrug conjugate of 10074-G4 and DON (10074-DON) was developed, which could be effectively loaded into a polysaccharide-based nanocarrier (PS). Results: The treatment with Myc inhibitors led to significant induction of glutamine: fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase-1 (GFAT1) and enhanced protein glycosylation. Mechanistically, Myc inhibition triggered GFAT1 induction through the IREα-Xbp1s pathway. The combination use of Myc inhibitors and GFAT1 inhibitor DON led to a synergistic effect in inhibiting the proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells. Enhanced in vivo delivery of 10074-DON via the PS nanocarrier led to a significant inhibition of tumor growth along with an improvement in tumor immune microenvironment in several PCa animal models.

Although three novel androgen inhibitors (darolutamide, apalutamide, and enzalutamide) have been approved for patients with high-risk non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC), the economic evaluation of these novel treatments in China remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-utility of darolutamide combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), comparing with apalutamide + ADT and enzalutamide + ADT, in patients with high-risk nmCRPC from a healthcare system perspective in China.  Methods:   A partitioned survival model was developed to capture time spent by patients in three health states: nmCRPC, metastatic CRPC (mCRPC), and death. Clinical outcomes from the ARAMIS, PROSPER, and SPARTAN studies were obtained. In the absence of head-to-head studies, indirect treatment comparisons were conducted to capture the comparative effectiveness between darolutamide + ADT, apalutamide + ADT, and enzalutamide + ADT. The prices of apalutamide and enzalutamide were assumed to be the same as the initial launch price of darolutamide, since post-negotiation prices after national reimbursement drug list (NRDL) inclusion remain confidential. Other health resources costs, baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and utility were collected through literature or clinical expert interviews. Selected sensitivity analyses were also performed.  Results:   For a 20-year time horizon, darolutamide + ADT was associated with lower cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) than apalutamide + ADT and enzalutamide + ADT (202,897 Chinese yuan (CNY)/QALY vs. 228,998 CNY/QALY and 221,409 CNY/QALY, respectively) (exchange rate, 1 USD = 6.7871 CNY). Darolutamide + ADT had better health outcomes and lower total costs compared to both apalutamide + ADT (+ 0.22 QALYs and - 72,818 CNY) and enzalutamide + ADT (+ 0.09 QALYs and - 67,451 CNY). Across the modelled sensitivity analyses (including hazard ratios and drug costs), darolutamide + ADT remained dominant or cost-effective.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of clinical quantitative low-count SPECT imaging during [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T/[225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T treatment.  Methods:   Eight prostate cancer patients (1000 MBq/8 MBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T/[225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T) received a single-bed quantitative 177Lu/225Ac SPECT/CT acquisition (1 h) at 24 h post treatment (high-energy collimator, 16 projections p. head à 3.5 min, 128 × 128 pixel). The gamma peak at 440 keV (width: 10%) of the progeny 213Bi was imaged along with the peak at 208 keV (width: 15%) of 177Lu. Quantification included CT-based attenuation and window-based scatter correction plus resolution modelling. Gaussian post-filtering with a full-width-half-maximum of 30 mm and 40-45 mm was employed to match the signal-to-noise ratio of 225Ac and 177Lu, respectively.  Results:   Kidney (r = 0.96, p < 0.01) and lesion (r = 0.94, p < 0.01) SUV for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T and [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T showed a strong and significant correlation. Kidney SUV were significantly higher (p < 0.01) for [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T (2.5 ± 0.8 vs. 2.1 ± 0.9), while for [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T lesion SUV were significantly higher (p = 0.03; 1.8 ± 1.1 vs. 2.1 ± 1.5). For absorbed dose estimates, significant differences regarding the kidneys remained, while no significant differences for lesion dosimetry were found.  Conclusion:   Quantitative low-count SPECT imaging of the peak at 440 keV during [225Ac]Ac-PSMA-I&T therapy is feasible.

Prostate cancer treatment access and patterns of care remain unknown.  Methods:   We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data to compare incidence, primary treatment, and cancer-specific mortality across American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White patients. Baseline characteristics included prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score (GS), tumor stage, 9-level Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment risk score, county characteristics, and health-care provider density. Primary outcomes were first definitive treatment and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   American Indian and Alaska Native patients were more frequently diagnosed with higher PSA, GS greater than or equal or 8, stage greater than or equal to cT3, high-risk disease overall (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment risk score ≥ 6), and metastases at diagnosis than any other group. Adjusting for age, PSA, GS, and clinical stage, American Indian or Alaska Native patients with localized prostate cancer were more likely to undergo external beam radiation than radical prostatectomy and had the highest rates of no documented treatment. Five-year PCSM was higher among American Indian and Alaska Natives than any other racial group. However, after multivariable adjustment accounting for clinical and pathologic factors, county-level demographics, and provider density, American Indian and Alaska Native patient PCSM hazards were no different than those of White patients.  Conclusions:   American Indian or Alaska Native patients have more advanced prostate cancer, lower rates of definitive treatment, higher mortality, and reside in areas of less specialty care.

This is driving many retrospective studies where historical data are mined to train machine learning models; however, recent decades have seen considerable advances in dose calculation that could have a direct impact on the dosiomic features such studies seek to extract. Is it necessary to recalculate planned dose distributions using a common algorithm if retrospective datasets from different institutions are included? Does a change in dose calculation grid size part way through a retrospective cohort, introduce bias in the extracted dosiomic features? The purpose of this study is to assess the stability of dosiomic features against variations in three factors: the dose calculation algorithm type, version, and dose grid size.  Methods:   Dose distributions for 27 prostate patients who received EBRT were recalculated in the Eclipse Treatment Planning System (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, California, USA) using two algorithms (AAA and Acuros XB), two versions (version 13.6 and 15.6), and three dose grids (2, 2.5 s, and 3 mm) - 12 dose distributions for each patient. Ninety-three dosiomic features were extracted from each dose distribution and each of the following regions-of-interest: high dose PTV (PTV_High), 1 cm rind around PTV_High (PTV_Ring), low dose PTV (PTV_Low), rectum, and bladder using PyRadiomics. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for each dosiomic feature. Hierarchical clustering was used to group features with high and low variability. Three-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed to investigate the effect of the three different factors on dosiomic features that were classified with high variation. Additionally, CVs were calculated for cumulative dose volume histograms (DVHs) to test their ability to detect the variations in dose distributions.  Results:   For PTV_Ring, PTV_Low, and rectum, all the dosiomic features had low CV (average CV ≤ 0.26) across the varying dose calculation conditions. For PTV_High, six dosiomic features showed CV > 0.26, and dose calculation algorithm type and grid size were the major sources of within-patient variation. For bladder, one dosiomic feature had average CV > 0.26, but none of the three dose calculation-related factors led to a statistically significant variation. The CVs for all the DVHs were very small (CV < 0.05).  Conclusion:   For all the regions-of-interest examined in this study, the majority of the dosiomic features were stable against variations in dose calculation; however, some of the dosiomic features for PTV_High and bladder had significant variations due to differences in dose calculation details. DVHs were detecting less variation than dosiomic features.""","""['Lingyue Sun', 'Wendy Smith', 'Charles Kirkby']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Dosimetric comparison of analytical anisotropic algorithm and the two dose reporting modes of Acuros XB dose calculation algorithm\xa0in volumetric modulated arc therapy of carcinoma lung and carcinoma prostate.', 'On dose cube pixel spacing pre-processing for features extraction stability in dosiomic studies.', 'Dose-volume and radiobiological dependence on the calculation grid size in prostate VMAT planning.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological comparison in different dose calculation grid sizes between Acuros XB and anisotropic analytical algorithm for prostate VMAT.', 'Dose calculation of Acuros XB and Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm in lung stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment with flattening filter free beams and the potential role of calculation grid size.']"""

In this study, RNA sequencing was conducted in PCa cells after clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9)-based CHD1 knockout. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated upregulation of hypoxia-related pathways. A subsequent study confirmed that CHD1 deletion significantly upregulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) expression. Mechanistic investigation revealed that CHD1 deletion upregulated HIF1α by transcriptionally downregulating prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2), a prolyl hydroxylase catalyzing the hydroxylation of HIF1α and thus promoting its degradation by the E3 ligase von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL). Functional analysis showed that CHD1 deletion promoted angiogenesis and glycolysis, possibly through HIF1α target genes. Taken together, these findings indicate that CHD1 deletion enhances HIF1α expression through PHD2 downregulation and therefore promotes angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming in PCa.""","""['Yu-Zhao Wang', 'Yu-Chen Qian', 'Wen-Jie Yang', 'Lei-Hong Ye', 'Guo-Dong Guo', 'Wei Lv', 'Meng-Xi Huan', 'Xiao-Yu Feng', 'Ke Wang', 'Zhao Yang', 'Yang Gao', 'Lei Li', 'Yu-Le Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian J Androl""","""['Mutant versions of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) can protect HIF1α from SART1-mediated degradation in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Prolyl hydroxylase 2 dependent and Von-Hippel-Lindau independent degradation of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 alpha by selenium in clear cell renal cell carcinoma leads to tumor growth inhibition.', 'Phospholipase D2 promotes degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α independent of lipase activity.', 'The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) degradation, and cancer pathogenesis.', 'Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein and hypoxia-inducible factor in kidney cancer.', 'Cell fate determination and lineage plasticity in prostate cancer.']"""

The following body composition parameters were calculated using computed tomography: skeletal muscle index (SMI), visceral adipose tissue index (VATI), and subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI). Pretreatment serum adipocytokine levels, including interleukin 6, insulin, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, adiponectin, and resistin, were measured using the multiplex bead-based immunoassays. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used for survival analyses. Of the 453 mCRPC patients initially identified, 105 were included in the analysis.

Nevertheless, DL-CAD systems are vulnerable to high heterogeneities in DWI, which can interfere with DL-CAD assessments and impair performance. This study aims to compare PCa detection of DL-CAD between zoomed-field-of-view echo-planar DWI (z-DWI) and full-field-of-view DWI (f-DWI) and find the risk factors affecting DL-CAD diagnostic efficiency.  Methods:   This retrospective study enrolled 354 consecutive participants who underwent MRI including T2WI, f-DWI, and z-DWI because of clinically suspected PCa. A DL-CAD was used to compare the performance of f-DWI and z-DWI both on a patient level and lesion level. We used the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics analysis and alternative free-response receiver operating characteristics analysis to compare the performances of DL-CAD using f- DWI and z-DWI. The risk factors affecting the DL-CAD were analyzed using logistic regression analyses. P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Results:   DL-CAD with z-DWI had a significantly better overall accuracy than that with f-DWI both on patient level and lesion level (AUCpatient: 0.89 vs. 0.86; AUClesion: 0.86 vs. 0.76; P < .001). The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of lesions in DWI was an independent risk factor of false positives (odds ratio [OR] = 1.12; P < .001). Rectal susceptibility artifacts, lesion diameter, and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were independent risk factors of both false positives (ORrectal susceptibility artifact = 5.46; ORdiameter, = 1.12; ORADC = 0.998; all P < .001) and false negatives (ORrectal susceptibility artifact = 3.31; ORdiameter = 0.82; ORADC = 1.007; all P ≤ .03) of DL-CAD.

Males with biopsy or radical prostatectomy-proven PCa were included for analysis, collecting additional clinical parameters such as age, BMI, PSA, Gleason Group (GG), and staging. Patients were divided into 4 groups of PRS quartiles. Intergroup differences were assessed, as well as risk ratio and predictive performance based on GG using logistic regression analysis and AUC. No significant intergroup differences were observed for BMI, PSA, and rate of ≥ T3a tumors on pathology. Rate of GG ≥ 2, GG ≥ 3, and GG ≥ 4 showed a significant pattern of increase by PRS quartile (p < 0.001, < 0.001, and 0.039, respectively).

Combining PRS with PSA improved prediction of early onset csPCa (AUC 0.759) compared to PRS (AUC 0.627) and PSA alone (AUC 0.736). To conclude, an ethnic-specific PRS was found to predict susceptibility of aggressive PCa in addition to improving detection of csPCa when combined with PSA in early onset populations.

Despite being a prevalent cancer afflicting the global male population, the epidemiological association between phthalates and prostate cancer remains understudied. This work aims to investigate whether phthalate metabolites are related to prostate cancer. Moreover, we sought to understand whether their elevated concentrations are associated with increased serum concentrations of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), among non-prostate cancer interviewees. According to National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2003 to 2010, we screened eligible men aged 20 years or older. Then, crude and multivariate regression models were constructed to assess the relationship. The phthalates significantly related to PCa were analyzed based on variables associated with PCa status and PSA. The molar sum ∑di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (∑DEHP) was simultaneously associated with increased risk of PCa and increasing PSA concentrations. Among PCa-related phthalates, high molecular weight phthalate metabolites included mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and three metabolites of DEHP.

After preoperative injection of a 99mTc-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitor, radioguided intraoperative identification and resection of lesions is facilitated by means of suitable γ-probes. First clinical experiences show the feasibility of RGS and suggest superiority over conventional lymph node dissection in recurrent PCa. However, commonly used [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S exhibits slow whole-body clearance, thus hampering optimal tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) during surgery. We therefore aimed to develop novel 99mTc-labeled, PSMA-targeted radioligands with optimized pharmacokinetic profile to increase TBR at the time of surgery.  Methods:   Three 99mTc-labeled N4-PSMA ligands were preclinically evaluated and compared to [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S. PSMA affinity (IC50) and internalization were determined on LNCaP cells. Lipophilicity was assessed by means of the distribution coefficient logD7.4 and an ultrafiltration method was used to determine binding to human plasma proteins. Biodistribution studies and static µSPECT/CT-imaging were performed at 6 h p.i. on LNCaP tumor-bearing CB17-SCID mice.  Results:   The novel N4-PSMA tracers were readily labeled with [99mTc]TcO4- with RCP > 95%. Comparable and high PSMA affinity was observed for all [99mTc]Tc-N4-PSMA-ligands. The ligands showed variable binding to human plasma and medium to low lipophilicity (logD7.4 - 2.6 to - 3.4), both consistently decreased compared to [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S. Biodistribution studies revealed comparable tumor uptake among all [99mTc]Tc-N4-PSMA-ligands and [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S, while clearance from most organs was superior for the novel tracers. Accordingly, increased TBR were achieved. [99mTc]Tc-N4-PSMA-12 showed higher TBR than [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S for blood and all evaluated tissue. In addition, a procedure suitable for routine clinical production of [99mTc]Tc-N4-PSMA-12 was established. Labeling with 553 ± 187 MBq was achieved with RCP of 98.5 ± 0.6% (n = 10).

Bufadienolides, the active ingredients of Chansu, show a robust anti-proliferative effect against prostate cancer cells in vitro, but whether bufadienolides could regulate the lipid metabolism in prostate cancer has not been evaluated.  Objectives:   Our study explored the regulatory effects of bufadienolides on lipid metabolism in human prostate carcinoma cells (PC-3).  Methods:   Untargeted lipidomics and transcriptomics were combined to study the effect of different bufadienolides interventions on lipid and gene changes of PC-3 cells. The key genes related to lipid metabolism and prostate cancer development were verified by qPCR and western blotting.  Results:   Lipidomic analysis showed that the active bufadienolides significantly downregulated the content of long-chain lipids of PC-3 cells. Based on transcriptomic and qPCR analyses, many genes related to lipid metabolism were significantly regulated by active bufadienolides, such as ELOVL6, CYP2E1, GAL3ST1, CERS1, PLA2G10, PLD1, SPTLC3, and GPX2. Bioinformatics analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas database and literature retrieval showed that elongation of very long-chain fatty acids protein 6 (ELOVL6) and phospholipase D1 (PLD1) might be important regulatory genes. Western blot analysis revealed that active bufadienolides could downregulate PLD1 protein levels which might promote anti-prostate cancer effect.  Conclusions:   All these findings support that bufadienolides might induce lipid metabolic remodeling by regulating long-chain lipids synthesis and phospholipid hydrolysis to achieve an anti-prostate cancer effect, and PLD1 would probably be the key protein.""","""['Rong Zhang#', 'Zijia Zhang#', 'Wenyong Wu', 'Jingying Shi', 'Entezar Berk', 'Wei Li', 'Yanping Deng', 'Zhaojun Wang', 'Jinjun Hou', 'Huali Long', 'Min Lei', 'Wanying Wu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Metabolomics""","""[""The lipidomic profile of the tumoral periprostatic adipose tissue reveals alterations in tumor cell's metabolic crosstalk."", 'Lipidomic Profiling of Clinical Prostate Cancer Reveals Targetable Alterations in Membrane Lipid Composition.', 'Human Cytomegalovirus pUL37x1 Is Important for Remodeling of Host Lipid Metabolism.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).', 'Bufadienolides from amphibians: A promising source of anticancer prototypes for radical innovation, apoptosis triggering and Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition.']"""

Here, we investigated the PCA3/PRUNE2 regulatory axis from early (tumorigenic) to late (biochemical recurrence) genetic events during human prostate cancer progression.  Methods:   The reciprocal PCA3 and PRUNE2 gene expression relationship in paired prostate cancer and adjacent normal prostate was analyzed in two independent retrospective cohorts of clinically annotated cases post-radical prostatectomy: a single-institutional discovery cohort (n=107) and a multi-institutional validation cohort (n=497). We compared the tumor gene expression of PCA3 and PRUNE2 to their corresponding expression in the normal prostate. We also serially examined clinical/pathological variables including time to disease recurrence.  Results:   We consistently observed increased expression of PCA3 and decreased expression of PRUNE2 in prostate cancer compared with the adjacent normal prostate across all tumor grades and stages. However, there was no association between the relative gene expression levels of PCA3 or PRUNE2 and time to disease recurrence, independent of tumor grades and stages.  Conclusions:   We concluded that upregulation of the lncRNA PCA3 and targeted downregulation of the protein-coding PRUNE2 gene in prostate cancer could be early (rather than late) molecular events in the progression of human prostate tumorigenesis but are not associated with biochemical recurrence.

Risks caused by known inherited factors such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 pathogenic variants are well established, but these account for only about 15% of ovarian cancer cases. Less is known about the possible familial risks of sporadic ovarian cancers.  Material and methods:   Using registry data, we conducted a retrospective cohort study with a total of 6501 first-degree relatives of 559 epithelial ovarian cancer patients. We studied the occurrence of overall cancer and cancer in specific sites known or suspected to be associated with ovarian cancer (breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, lung and trachea, skin melanoma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, and stomach).  Results:   The overall number of cancers was not increased among the first-degree relatives of epithelial ovarian cancer patients during the up to 48 years of follow up. Among female relatives, the standardized incidence ratio for ovarian cancer was 1.92 (95% CI 1.27-2.79), mostly explained by a 2.30-fold (95% CI 1.46-3.45) risk among the patients' sisters. There was a decreasing trend in the standardized incidence ratio for ovarian cancer among patients' sisters by increasing age of the index patient.  Conclusions:   In our study cohort, we did not observe an increase in the overall cancer risk among the first-degree relatives of epithelial ovarian cancer patients in comparison with the general population. The risk for ovarian cancer, however, was increased. Current recommendations suggest prophylactic removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries only with identified inherited risk factors.

The details of the frequency and significance of BRCA alterations in localized PC remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the frequency and clinical significance of BRCA alterations in localized PCs using an in-house next-generation sequencer (NGS) system.  Methods:   DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of surgical specimens from 126 patients with clinically localized PC who underwent radical prostatectomy. The mutation information of 164 cancer genes was analyzed using the PleSSision-Rapid test. Both copy number (CN) variation and loss of heterozygosity of various genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, were estimated and reported.  Results:   Next-generation sequencer analyses revealed that the BRCA2 CN was decreased in 17 patients (13.5%) and the BRCA1 CN in six (4.8%) patients. NGS-based CN values were shown to be highly correlated with droplet digital PCR-based CN values. Tissue-specific BRCA expression investigated using the Human Protein Atlas showed that the decreased CN of BRCA2, but not BRCA1, is responsible for the decreased BRCA activity in PC. Ten of the 22 patients with decreased BRCA2 CN were presumed to have somatic heterozygous deletion. There were no observed associations between the heterozygous deletion of BRCA2 and various clinicopathological parameters. Furthermore, three of 10 patients developed biochemical recurrence within 3 months after surgery. Multivariate analyses revealed that the initial prostate-specific antigen levels and BRCA2 CN were independent factors for biochemical recurrence.  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that a decrease in BRCA2 CN may be used as a biomarker for predicting recurrence after surgery in localized PC. Early screening for somatic alterations in BRCA2 using NGS may help to broadly predict the risk of PC progression.""","""['Takuhisa Nukaya', 'Makoto Sumitomo', 'Eiji Sugihara', 'Mayu Takeda', 'Sachio Nohara', 'Shigeki Tanishima', 'Masashi Takenaka', 'Kenji Zennami', 'Kiyoshi Takahara', 'Ryoichi Shiroki', 'Hideyuki Saya']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Overexpression of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in prostatectomy specimens is predictive of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Increased frequency of germline BRCA2 mutations associates with prostate cancer metastasis in a racially diverse patient population.', 'Statewide Retrospective Review of Familial Pancreatic Cancer in Delaware, and Frequency of Genetic Mutations in Pancreatic Cancer Kindreds.', 'Germline BRCA mutation in male carriers-ripe for precision oncology?', 'Overall Survival and Clinical Characteristics of BRCA-Associated Cholangiocarcinoma: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.', 'Usefulness of BRCA and ctDNA as Prostate Cancer Biomarkers: A Meta-Analysis.']"""

Methods and results:   A panel of nine prostate pathology experts from five continents independently reviewed 304 digitised biopsies for cribriform cancer according to recent International Society of Urological Pathology criteria. The biopsies were collected from a series of 702 biopsies that were reviewed by one of the panellists for enrichment of high-grade cancer and potentially cribriform structures.

Emerging evidence shows that exosomes carry miRNAs in blood that encode the metabolic status of originating tissues and deliver their cargo to target tissues to modulate expression of critical genes. Exosomal communication potentially connects abnormal metabolism to cancer progression. Here, we hypothesized that T2D plasma exosomes induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and immune checkpoints in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that plasma exosomes from subjects with T2D induce EMT features in prostate cancer cells and upregulate the checkpoint genes CD274 and CD155. We demonstrate that specific exosomal miRNAs that are differentially abundant in plasma of T2D adults compared to nondiabetic controls (miR374a-5p, miR-93-5p and let-7b-3p) are delivered to cancer cells, thereby regulating critical target genes. We build on our previous reports showing BRD4 controls migration and dissemination of castration-resistant prostate cancer, and transcription of key EMT genes, to show that T2D exosomes require BRD4 to drive EMT and immune ligand expression.

In a roundtable symposium, investigators summarized the contemporary evidence in several key clinical areas. TD negatively impacts human health and quality of life and is associated with increased mortality. Several studies have demonstrated that TTh in men with TD reduced all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The longstanding belief that TTh is associated with increased prostate cancer (PCa) risk is contradicted by recent evidence, including multiple studies showing that TTh is associated with reduced PCa risk. Similarly, the weight of current evidence indicates the purported concern that TTh is associated with increased cardiovascular risk is incorrect. Normalization of physiological T reduces myocardial infarction, stroke, and deaths compared with men whose testosterone levels failed to normalize. In diabetic men TTh improves insulin resistance, and a large 2-year controlled study in men with abnormal glucose tolerance showed a substantially reduced rate of diabetes among men treated with TTh compared with untreated controls. Long-term TTh in diabetic men resulted in progressive improvements in obesity and insulin requirements, including a substantial number who experienced complete remission of diabetes. Finally, TTh has been shown to reduce severe outcomes with Covid-19 infection.

OMV (half dose: not less than 500 TCID units; 0.25 mL) was encapsulated in thiolated chitosan and outermost coating with hyaluronic acid by ionic gelation method characterizing parameters was performed.  Results and discussion:   CD44 high expression was confirmed in prostatic adenocarcinoma (PRAD) by GEPIA which extracted data of normal and cancer tissue from GTEx and TCGA. Bioinformatics tools confirmed the viral hemagglutinin capsid protein interaction with human Caspase-I, NLRP3, and TNF-α and viral fusion protein interaction with COX-II and Caspase-I after successful delivery of MV encapsulated in NFs due to high affinity of hyaluronic acid with CD44 on the surface of prostate cancer cells. Particle size = 275.6 mm, PDI = 0.372, and ±11.5 zeta potential were shown by zeta analysis, while the thiolated group in NFs was confirmed by FTIR and Raman analysis. SEM and XRD showed a spherical smooth surface and crystalline nature, respectively, while TEM confirmed virus encapsulation within nanoparticles, which makes it very useful in targeted virus delivery systems. The virus was released from NFs in a sustained but continuous release pattern till 48 h. The encapsulated virus titer was calculated as 2.34×107 TCID50/mL units, which showed syncytia formation on post-day infection 7. Multiplicities of infection 0.1, 0.5, 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 of HA-coated OMV-loaded NFs as compared to MV vaccine on PC3 was inoculated with IC50 of 5.1 and 3.52, respectively, and growth inhibition was seen after 72 h via MTT assay which showed apoptotic cancer cell death.  Conclusion:   Active targeted, efficacious, and sustained delivery of formulated oncolytic MV is a potent moiety in cancer treatment at lower doses with safe potential for normal prostate cells.""","""['Faiza Naseer', 'Tahir Ahmad', 'Kousain Kousar', 'Salik Kakar', 'Rabia Gul', 'Sadia Anjum', 'Usman Shareef']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['CD44 targeted delivery of oncolytic Newcastle disease virus encapsulated in thiolated chitosan for sustained release in cervical cancer: a targeted immunotherapy approach.', 'Green synthesis of hyaluronic acid coated, thiolated chitosan nanoparticles for CD44 targeted delivery and sustained release of Cisplatin in cervical carcinoma.', 'Engineered measles virus as a novel oncolytic therapy against prostate cancer.', 'Opportunities to debottleneck the downstream processing of the oncolytic measles virus.', 'Measles to the Rescue: A Review of Oncolytic Measles Virus.', 'CD44 targeted delivery of oncolytic Newcastle disease virus encapsulated in thiolated chitosan for sustained release in cervical cancer: a targeted immunotherapy approach.']"""

The patient's life depends upon the accuracy of the treatment plan, which is left in the hands of the vendor-specific software automatically generating the plan after an initial patient consultation and planning with a medical professional. However, corrupted and erroneous treatment plan data have previously resulted in severe patient harm when errors go undetected and radiation proceeds. The aim of this paper is to develop an automatic error-checking system to prevent the accidental delivery of radiation treatment to an area of the human body (i.e., the treatment site) that differs from the plan's documented intended site. To this end, we develop a method for structuring treatment plan data in order to feed machine-learning (ML) classifiers and predict a plan's treatment site. In practice, a warning may be raised if the prediction disagrees with the documented intended site. The contribution of this paper is in the strategic structuring of the complex, intricate, and nonuniform data of modern treatment planning and from multiple vendors in order to easily train ML algorithms. A three-step process utilizing up- and down-sampling and dimension reduction, the method we develop in this paper reduces the thousands of parameters comprising a single treatment plan to a single two-dimensional heat map that is independent of the specific vendor or construction of the machine used for treatment. Our heat-map structure lends itself well to feed well-established ML algorithms, and we train-test random forest, softmax, k-nearest neighbors, shallow neural network, and support vector machine using real clinical treatment plans from several hospitals in the United States. The paper demonstrates that the proposed method characterizes treatment sites so well that ML classifiers may predict head-neck, breast, and prostate treatment sites with an accuracy of about 94%.

However, whether fatty acid metabolism (FAM)-related genes are associated with prostate cancer (PCa) prognosis is not known. Therefore, we established a novel prognostic model based on FAM-related genes to predict biochemical recurrence in PCa patients. First, PCa sequencing data were acquired from TCGA as the training cohort and GSE21032 as the validation cohort. Second, a prostate cancer prognostic model containing 10 FAM-related genes was constructed using univariate Cox and LASSO. Principal component analysis and t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding analysis showed that the model was highly effective. Third, PCa patients were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to the model risk score. Survival analysis, ROC curve analysis, and independent prognostic analysis showed that the high-risk group had short recurrence-free survival (RFS), and the risk score was an independent diagnostic factor with diagnostic value in PCa patients. External validation using GSE21032 also showed that the prognostic model had high reliability. A nomogram based on a prognostic model was constructed for clinical use. Fourth, tumor immune correlation analyses, such as the ESTIMATE, CIBERSORT algorithm, and ssGSEA, showed that the high-risk group had higher immune cell infiltration, lower tumour purity, and worse RFS. Various immune checkpoints were expressed at higher levels in high-risk patients. In summary, this prognostic model is a promising prognostic biomarker for PCa that should improve the prognosis of PCa patients.

Androgen receptor (AR) antagonists and a cytochrome P450 17A1 inhibitor have been used to treat CRPC, but cancer cells readily develop resistance to these drugs. In this study, to improve the therapy of CRPC, we searched for natural compounds which block androgen signaling. Among cinnamic acid derivatives contained in Brazilian green propolis, artepillin C (ArtC) suppressed expressions of androgen-induced prostate-specific antigen and transmembrane protease serine 2 in a dose-dependent manner. Reporter assays revealed that ArtC displayed AR antagonist activity, albeit weaker than an AR antagonist flutamide. In general, aberrant activation of the androgen signaling is involved in the resistance of prostate cancer cells to hormone therapy. Recently, apalutamide, a novel AR antagonist, has been in clinical use, but its drug-resistant cases have been already reported. To search for compounds which overcome the resistance to apalutamide, we established apalutamide-resistant prostate cancer 22Rv1 cells (22Rv1/APA). The 22Rv1/APA cells showed higher AR expression and androgen sensitivity than parental 22Rv1 cells. ArtC inhibited androgen-induced proliferation of 22Rv1/APA cells by suppressing the enhanced androgen signaling through blocking the nuclear translocation of AR. In addition, ArtC potently sensitized the resistant cells to apalutamide by inducing apoptotic cell death due to mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest that the intake of Brazilian green propolis containing ArtC improves prostate cancer therapy.""","""['Atsumi Ota', 'Mina Kawai', 'Yudai Kudo', 'Jin Segawa', 'Manami Hoshi', 'Shinya Kawano', 'Yuta Yoshino', 'Kenji Ichihara', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Naohiro Fujimoto', 'Toshiyuki Matsunaga', 'Satoshi Endo', 'Akira Ikari']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Restoration of the cellular secretory milieu overrides androgen dependence of in\xa0vivo generated castration resistant prostate cancer cells overexpressing the androgen receptor.', 'Recruitment of miR-8080 by luteolin inhibits androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Combination therapy with novel androgen receptor antagonists and statin for castration-resistant\xa0prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Multivariable restricted cubic spline regression was used to explore the non-linear associations of PSA and PCSM.  Results:   102,089 men were included, of whom 71,138 had low/intermediate-grade and 22,425 had high-grade PCa. In high-grade, 4-year PCSM was higher with PSA ≤5 than PSA 5.1-10 for men treated with EBRT (hazard ratio 1.96 (95% confidence interval 1.15-3.34) or no radical local treatment (hazard ratio 1.99 (95% confidence interval 1.33-2.98). Restricted cubic spline regression showed that PSA and PCSM have a non-linear association in high-grade but a linear association in low/intermediate-grade PCa.  Conclusion:   The low-PSA/high-grade combination in M0 PCa treated with EBRT has a higher PCSM than those with high-grade and intermediate PSA levels. In high-grade disease, the PSA association was non-linear; by contrast, low/intermediate-grade had a linear relationship.

A cohort of men with biopsy proven prostate cancer and pre-prostatectomy mpMRI were studied. PCa and benign ROIs (1524) were identified on mpMRI and histopathology with histopathology serving as the reference standard. Logistic regression models were created to differentiate PCa from benign tissues. The MRI images were registered to ensure correct overlay. The cancer models were applied to each image voxel within prostates to create probability maps of cancer and of high-grade cancer. Use of an optimum probability threshold quantified PCa volume for all lesions >0.1 cc. Accuracies were calculated using area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). The PCa models utilized apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), T2 weighted (T2W), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE MRI) enhancement slope, and DCE MRI washout as the statistically significant MRI scans. Application of the PCa maps method provided total PCa volume and individual lesion volumes. The AUCs derived from lesion analysis were 0.91 for all PCa and 0.73 for high-grade PCa. At the optimum threshold, the PCa maps detected 135 / 150 (90%) histopathological lesions >0.1 cc. This study showed the feasibility of cancer risk maps, created from pre-prostatectomy, mpMR images validated with histopathology, to detect PCa lesions >0.1 cc. The method quantified the volume of cancer within the prostate. Method improvements were identified by determining root causes for over and underestimation of cancer volumes. The maps have the potential for improved non-invasive capability in quantitative detection, localization, volume estimation, and MRI characterization of PCa.""","""['Matthew Gibbons', 'Jeffry P Simko', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Susan M Noworolski']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Characterization and stratification of prostate lesions based on comprehensive multiparametric MRI using detailed whole-mount histopathology as a reference standard.', 'Comparison of T2-Weighted Imaging, DWI, and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Calculation of Prostate Cancer Index Lesion Volume: Correlation With Whole-Mount Pathology.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Semi-quantitative and quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI parameters as prostate cancer imaging biomarkers for biologically targeted radiation therapy.', 'Can Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Be Detected with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging?

After curative treatment, from 27% to 53% of patients will experience biochemical recurrence (BR). With the development of focal therapies, precise early identification of recurrence's sites is of utmost importance in order to deliver individualized treatment on positive lesions. The aim of this study was to assess the detection rate (DR) of 68Ga-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in selected patients with prostate cancer BR and recent negative 18F-choline PET/CT.  Patients and methods:   We performed a retrospective analysis including all patients with CaP referred for BR with a negative 18F-choline PET/CT, and who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT between October, 2018 and December, 2019. The overall DR of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was calculated, and described according to BR characteristics especially PSA levels and velocity. Patients were followed up for at least 1 year. Patient management following 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and PSA levels evolution after treatment were also recorded.  Results:   One hundred fifty-nine patients comprising 164 examinations were analyzed. The overall DR of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for BR was 65.9% (95CI, 58.6-73.1). The DR was 52.5% (95CI, 39.9-65.0), 70.6% (95CI, 55.3-85.9), 70.4% (95CI, 53.1-87.6), and 78.6% (95CI, 66.2-91.0) for PSA levels between 0.2 and 0.49 ng/mL, 0.5 to 0.99 ng/mL, 1 to 1.99 ng/mL and PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL, respectively. The DR was 70.7% (95CI, 59.0-82.4) with a PSA doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤6 months and 65.2% (95CI, 55.5-74.9) with a PSA-DT >6 months.

Correlation between imaging signals of 2 PET tracers and the corresponding target structures was assessed. The first tracer was [68Ga]Ga-PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)-HBED-CC (N,N'-bis [2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid) [68Ga]Ga-PSMAHBED-CC ([68Ga]PSMA), which is already implemented in clinical routines. The second tracer was 16β-[18F]fluoro-5α-dihydrotestosterone (16β-[18F]FDHT), which binds to the androgen receptor (AR). The AR is particularly interesting in PC, because AR expression status and its shift during therapy might directly influence patient care. Methods: This prospective, explorative clinical study included 10 newly diagnosed PC patients. Each patient underwent [68Ga]PSMA PET/MRI and [18F]FDHT PET/MRI scans before prostatectomy. Cancer SUVs were determined and related to background SUVs. After prostatectomy, tumor tissue was sampled, and AR and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression was determined. AR and PSMA expression was evaluated quantitatively with the open-source bioimage analysis software QuPath and with a 4-tier rating system. Correlation between imaging signals and marker expression was statistically assessed. Results: For [18F]FDHT, the SUVmax/SUVbackground ratio showed a significant, strong correlation (r = 0.72; P = 0.019) with the AR optical density of the correlating tissue sample. The correlation between PSMA optical density and the [68Ga]PSMA SUVmax/SUVbackground ratio was not significant (P = 0.061), yet a positive correlation trend could be observed (r = 0.61). SUVmax/SUVbackground ratios were higher for [68Ga]PSMA (mean ± SD, 34.9 ± 24.8) than for [18F]FDHT (4.8 ± 1.2). In line with these findings, the tumor detection rates were 90% for the [68Ga]PSMA PET scan but only 40% for the [18F]FDHT PET scan. The 4-tier rating of PSMA staining intensity yielded very homogeneous results, with values of 3+ for most subjects (90%). AR staining was rated as 1+ in 2 patients (20%), 2+ in 4 patients (40%), and 3+ in 4 patients (40%). Conclusion: [18F]FDHT PET may be useful for monitoring AR expression and alterations in AR expression during treatment of PC patients. This approach may facilitate early detection of treatment resistance and allows for adaptation of therapy to prevent cancer progression. [18F]FDHT PET is inferior to [68Ga]PSMA PET for primary PC diagnosis, but the correlation between [68Ga]PSMA SUVs and PSMA expression is weaker than that between [18F]FDHT and the AR.""","""['Valentin Al Jalali', 'Gabriel Wasinger', 'Sazan Rasul', 'Bernhard Grubmüller', 'Beatrix Wulkersdorfer', 'Theresa Balber', 'Markus Mitterhauser', 'Judit Simon', 'Marcus Hacker', 'Shahrokh Shariat', 'Gerda Egger', 'Markus Zeitlinger']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prospective Comparison of 18F-Fluoromethylcholine Versus 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients Who Have Rising PSA After Curative Treatment and Are Being Considered for Targeted Therapy.', 'Quantitative Test-Retest Measurement of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC in Tumor and Normal Tissue.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', '68Ga-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) for primary staging of high-risk prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Androgen Receptor Imaging in the Management of Hormone-Dependent Cancers with Emphasis on Prostate Cancer.']"""

The lack of absorbed-dose-effect relationships currently prevents patient-specific activity personalization. To ease the implementation of dosimetry in the routine clinical workflow for RPT, simplified methods such as single-time-point (STP) instead of multiple-time-point (MTP) imaging protocols are required. This work aimed at assessing differences in the time-integrated activity (TIA) of STP versus MTP image-based dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. Methods: Twenty metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with MTP quantitative 177Lu-SPECT imaging data (∼24, 48, and 72 h post injection (p.i.)) available on first and second 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy cycles were included in this study. Time-activity curves were fitted for kidneys and lesions to derive effective half-lives and yield a reference TIA. STP approaches involved the formula by Hänscheid (STPH) and a prior-information method (STPprior) that uses the effective half-lives from the first therapy cycle. All time points were considered for the STP approaches. Percentage differences (PDs) in TIA between STP and MTP were compared for the second therapy cycle. Results: Using STPH at 48 h p.i. for kidneys showed a -1.3% ± 5.6% PD from MTP, whereas STPprior showed a PD of 4.6% ± 6.2%. The smallest average PDs for the 56 investigated individual lesions were found using STPprior at 48 h p.i., at only 0.4% ± 14.9%, whereas STPH at 72 h p.i. had a smallest PD of -1.9% ± 14.8%. Conclusion: STP dosimetry for 177Lu-PSMA-617 therapy using a single SPECT/CT scan at 48 or 72 h p.i. is feasible, with a PD of less than ±20% compared with MTP. The validity of both STPH and STPprior has been demonstrated. We believe this finding can increase the adoption of dosimetry and facilitate implementation in routine clinical RPT workflows. Doing so will ultimately enable the finding of dose-effect relationships based on fixed therapy activities that may, in future, allow for absorbed-dose-based RPT activity personalization.""","""['Julia Brosch-Lenz', 'Astrid Delker', 'Friederike Völter', 'Lena M Unterrainer', 'Lena Kaiser', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Sibylle Ziegler', 'Arman Rahmim', 'Carlos Uribe', 'Guido Böning']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Pretherapeutic Comparative Dosimetry of 177Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 and 177Lu-PSMA I&T in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Examining Absorbed Doses of Indigenously Developed 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients at Baseline and During Course of Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy.', 'Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Radioligand Therapy Using 177Lu-PSMA I&T and 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Safety, Biodistribution, and Dosimetry.', 'Radiation Dosimetry in 177Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy.', 'A Walk with Lu-177 PSMA: How Close we Have Reached from Bench to Bedside?', 'Single-Time-Point Dosimetry of 177Lu-PSMA-617 Radionuclide Therapy with SPECT/CT.']"""

The impact of structural aspects on treatment is unknown but may lead to actionable insights to mitigate disparities. We sought to examine the associations between urology practice organization and racial composition and treatment patterns for Medicare beneficiaries with incident prostate cancer.  Methods:   Using a 20% sample of national Medicare data, we identified beneficiaries diagnosed with prostate cancer between January 2010 and December 2015 and followed them through 2016. We linked urologists to their practices with tax identification numbers. We then linked patients to practices on the basis of their primary urologist. We grouped practices into quartiles on the basis of their proportion of Black patients. We used multilevel mixed-effects models to identify treatment associations.  Results:   We identified 54,443 patients with incident prostate cancer associated with 4,194 practices. Most patients were White (87%), and 9% were Black. We found wide variation in racial practice composition and practice segregation. Patients in practices with the highest proportion of Black patients had the lowest socioeconomic status (43.1%), highest comorbidity (9.9% with comorbidity score ≥ 3), and earlier age at prostate cancer diagnosis (33.5% age 66-69 years; P < .01). Black patients had lower odds of definitive therapy (adjusted odds ratio, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.93) and underwent less treatment than White patients in every practice context. Black patients in practices with higher proportions of Black patients had higher treatment rates than Black patients in practices with lower proportions. Black patients had lower predicted probability of treatment (66%) than White patients (69%; P < .05).

Here, we found and identified a bifunctional small molecule Z15, which is both an effective AR antagonist and a selective AR degrader. Z15 could directly interact with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and activation function-1 region of AR, and promote AR degradation through the proteasome pathway. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that Z15 efficiently suppressed AR, AR mutants and ARVs transcription activity, downregulated mRNA and protein levels of AR downstream target genes, thereby overcoming AR LBD mutations, AR amplification, and ARVs-induced SGAs resistance in CRPC.

It overlaps with the ECL emission spectrum of CdS@CeO2, realizing the effective quenching of the ECL signal, which provides feasibility for subsequent practical application. The immunosensor exhibited good linearity in the concentration range 10 fg·mL-1 ~ 100 ng·mL-1, with a detection limit of 5.6 fg·mL-1.

The recent EAU guidelines recommend a first PSA test at the age of 50 years, if no family history of PCa or BRCA2 mutation exists. However, some men might harbor significant PCa at younger age; thus we evaluated the histopathological results of men treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) in their 40 s at our institution.  Materials and methods:   We relied on the data of all patients who underwent RP in our institution between 1992 and 2020 and were younger than 50 years at the time of surgery. The histopathological results are descriptively presented. Moreover, we tested the effect of a positive family history on the descriptive results.  Results:   Overall, 1225 patients younger than 50 years underwent RP at our institution. Median age was 47 years. Most patients showed favorable histopathological characteristics. However, 20% of patients had extraprostatic disease (≥ pT3a), 15% had ISUP Gleason grade group ≥ 3, and 7% had positive lymph nodes (pN1). Patients with a known positive family history did not have a higher rate of adverse disease as their counterparts with a negative family history.  Discussion:   Our data show that the majority of patients who were diagnosed with PCa at a very young age had favorable histopathological RP characteristics. However, a non-negligible proportion of patients already showed locally advanced disease and would have probably benefited from earlier PCa detection. This should be kept in mind when PCa screening recommendations are proposed.""","""['Gisa Mehring', 'Derya Tilki', 'Hans Heinzer', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Randi M Pose', 'Imke Thederan', 'Lars Budäus', 'Georg Salomon', 'Alexander Haese', 'Uwe Michl', 'Tobias Maurer', 'Hartwig Huland', 'Markus Graefen', 'Hendrik Isbarn']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Letter to the editor for the article ""Histopathological results of radical prostatectomy specimen of men younger than 50\xa0years of age at the time of surgery: possible implications for prostate cancer screening programs?"".', 'Radical prostatectomy represents an effective treatment in patients with specimen-confined high pathological Gleason score prostate cancer.', 'The increase of stage, grading, and metastases in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy during the last decade.', 'Functional and oncological outcome of salvage prostatectomy of locally recurrent prostate cancer following radiation therapy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

To enable automated Ki-67 LI assessment in routine clinical practice, a framework for automated Ki-67 LI quantification, which comprises three different artificial intelligence analysis steps and an algorithm for cell-distance analysis of multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry (mfIHC) staining, was developed and validated in a cohort of 12,475 prostate cancers. The prognostic impact of the Ki-67 LI was tested on a tissue microarray (TMA) containing one 0.6 mm sample per patient. A 'heterogeneity TMA' containing three to six samples from different tumor areas in each patient was used to model Ki-67 analysis of multiple different biopsies, and 30 prostate biopsies were analyzed to compare a 'classical' bright field-based Ki-67 analysis with the mfIHC-based framework. The Ki-67 LI provided strong and independent prognostic information in 11,845 analyzed prostate cancers (p < 0.001 each), and excellent agreement was found between the framework for automated Ki-67 LI assessment and the manual quantification in prostate biopsies from routine clinical practice (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.94 [95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.97]). The analysis of the heterogeneity TMA revealed that the Ki-67 LI of the sample with the highest Gleason score (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.68) was as prognostic as the mean Ki-67 LI of all six foci (AUC: 0.71 [p = 0.24]). The combined analysis of the Ki-67 LI and Gleason score obtained on identical tissue spots showed that the Ki-67 LI added significant additional prognostic information in case of classical International Society of Urological Pathology grades (AUC: 0.82 [p = 0.002]) and quantitative Gleason score (AUC: 0.83 [p = 0.018]). The Ki-67 LI is a powerful prognostic parameter in prostate cancer that is now applicable in routine clinical practice. In the case of multiple cancer-positive biopsies, the sole automated analysis of the worst biopsy was sufficient. © 2023 The Authors.

We previously showed that the rate-limiting and first oxygen-dependent enzyme of the committed cholesterol synthesis pathway, squalene monooxygenase (SM), can undergo partial proteasomal degradation that renders it constitutively active. Here, we show hypoxia is a physiological trigger for this truncation, which occurs through a two-part mechanism: (1) increased targeting of SM to the proteasome via stabilization of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCHF6 and (2) accumulation of the SM substrate, squalene, which impedes the complete degradation of SM and liberates its truncated form. This preserves SM activity and downstream pathway flux during hypoxia. These results uncover a feedforward mechanism that allows SM to accommodate fluctuating substrate levels and may contribute to its widely reported oncogenic properties.""","""['Hudson W Coates', 'Isabelle M Capell-Hattam', 'Ellen M Olzomer', 'Ximing Du', 'Rhonda Farrell', 'Hongyuan Yang', 'Frances L Byrne', 'Andrew J Brown']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Elife""","""['The mammalian cholesterol synthesis enzyme squalene monooxygenase is proteasomally truncated to a constitutively active form.', 'A key mammalian cholesterol synthesis enzyme, squalene monooxygenase, is allosterically stabilized by its substrate.', 'Cholesterol-dependent degradation of squalene monooxygenase, a control point in cholesterol synthesis beyond HMG-CoA reductase.', 'Squalene monooxygenase: a journey to the heart of cholesterol synthesis.', 'Post-translational control of the long and winding road to cholesterol.', 'A HIF independent oxygen-sensitive pathway for controlling cholesterol synthesis.']"""

However, TR biopsy is the most common procedure, and it seems that a cross-over to TP is delayed by logistical challenges such as costs, complexity, and lack of experience. We investigate whether well-selected patients without any risk factors may further undergo TR biopsy if all precautions to avoid infections are warranted.  Materials and methods:   Data were collected in our academic institution between August 2021 and March 2022 and after clinical implementation of the currently updated European Association of Urology guideline recommendations on the performance of prostate biopsy. Patients underwent either TP or TR biopsy according to a riskstratification based on risk factors of infectious complications. Follow-up asked for post-biopsy complications. Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) propensity score was used to balance baseline characteristics. Complications were subdivided into infectious and non-infectious complications.  Results:   In total, 294 patients were included with 161 patients undergoing TR vs. 133 patients undergoing TP biopsy. Complication rates were 2.2% for TP vs. 5.5% for TR biopsy concerning all complications. Infectious complication rates only were 0.7% for TP vs. 1.8% for TR biopsy. After IPTW adjustment, differences were statistically significant different (p = 0.01).  Conclusion:   Our study revealed that even in a well-selected patient cohort with presumably lower risk of infectious complications, TR biopsy leads to more post-biopsy complications than TP biopsy. This conclusion should motivate the urological community to switch to TP biopsy.""","""['Sebastian Berg', 'Karl Heinrich Tully', 'Vincent Hoffmann', 'Henning Bahlburg', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Guido Müller', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Moritz Reike']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Scand J Urol""","""['The eternal enigma in prostatic biopsy access route.', 'Transperineal Prostate Biopsy is Associated With Lower Tissue Core Pathogen Burden Relative to Transrectal Biopsy: Mechanistic Underpinnings for Lower Infection Risk in the Transperineal Approach.', 'The Detection of Prostate Cancer with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Prostate Biopsies is Superior with the Transperineal vs the Transrectal Approach.

Although the overall prostate cancer incidence rates have been declining since 1992, the average annual prostate cancer incidence rates among African American men were still higher than any other racial groups, and the mortality rates were 2.1 times higher than that of Caucasian men. This study examined what factors including cultural mistrust were related with the prostate cancer screening behaviors among African American males in the South East region. Out of 496 prostate educational seminar attendees, 304 volunteers completed the survey about the behaviors of prostate cancer, cultural mistrust for health providers and general health beliefs and health behaviors. Using Anderson's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use, hierarchical multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify which predisposing, enabling, and need factors could predict prostate cancer screening behaviors and whether there was any interaction effects among these predictors. Findings revealed that annual household income and annual health check-up were significantly related with the prostate cancer screening behaviors while the effect of health insurance was diminished among older African American males. Overall, results highlight the importance of financial resources as a determinant of prostate cancer screening behaviors among African American males implying the need of substantial support to overcome the obstacles from financial adversity.""","""['Youseung Kim', 'Mustapha Alhassan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Prev (2022)""","""[""Predictors of prostate cancer screening using Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use."", 'Factors that Influence Mammography Use for Breast Cancer Screening among African American Women.', 'Determinants of Prostate Specific Antigen Screening among Black Men in the United States in the Contemporary Era.', 'Patient perspectives of prostate cancer screening vary by race following 2018 guideline changes.', 'Prostate Cancer Screening Guidelines for African American Veterans: A New Perspective.']"""

Despite this benefit over leuprolide, no economic evaluation assessment to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of relugolix has been conducted. Therefore, this study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with 120 mg relugolix against 7.5 mg leuprolide for the treatment of APC.  Methods:   A Markov model was used to assess and compare the costs of APC treatment from a health care payer's perspective and the effectiveness of ADT with relugolix and leuprolide at the 3 lines of APC treatment among modified intent-to-treat patients. Relative progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated. Outcomes measured in the analyses included costs of the drugs and therapies, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), cost-effectiveness acceptability, and probability curves.  Results:   The cost-effectiveness analysis showed the ICER for ADT with relugolix to be US $49,571.1 per QALY. At the ICER value, the sensitivity analysis indicated that ADT with leuprolide was dominant in 100% of the simulations. ADT acceptance with relugolix was 100% when a willingness-to-pay threshold was set at US $100,000/QALY. At 5-years, the relative PFS and OS rates for relugolix at the first line of therapy were 72.7% and 86.0%, respectively, compared to 61.0% and 85.90% for leuprolide.  Conclusion:   Though the influence of adverse events was not considered in the analysis, ADT with relugolix was not a cost-effective choice for APC management. While the analysis revealed a slight chance of sustaining testosterone suppression with relugolix, ADT with relugolix provided no significant survival advantages over ADT with leuprolide.

A propensity score-matched study""","""Introduction:   High-resolution micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a novel precise imaging modality that allows targeted prostate biopsies and multiparametric magnet resonance imaging (mpMRI) fusion. Its high resolution relying on a 29 MHz transducer allows real-time visualisation of prostate cancer lesions; this might overcome the inaccuracy of conventional MRI-US fusion biopsy strategies. We compared cancer detection rates in patients who underwent transrectal (TR-B) versus transperineal (TP-B) MR-micro-US fusion biopsy.  Materials and methods:   1:2 propensity score matching was performed in 322 consecutive procedures: 56 TR-B and 266 TP-B. All prostate biopsies were performed using ExactVuTM micro-US system with mpMRI image fusion. Clinically significant disease was defined as grade group ≥2. The primary objective was to evaluate the detection of clinically significant disease according to access route. The secondary outcomes were to compare the respective detection rates of random and targeted biopsies stratified per access route and to evaluate micro-US for its potential added value.  Results:   47 men undergoing TR-B and 88 undergoing TP-B were matched for age, PSA, clinical stage, prostate volume, PIRADS score, number of mpMRI-visible lesions and indication to biopsy. The detection rates of clinically significant and of any prostate cancer did not differ between the two groups (45% TR-B vs 42% TP-B; p = 0.8, and 57% TR-B vs 59% TP-B; p = 0.9, respectively). Detection rates also did not differ significantly between random (p = 0.4) and targeted biopsies (p = 0.7) stratified per access route. Micro-US targeted biopsy detected 36 MRI-invisible lesions in 33 patients; 19% of these lesions were positive for clinically significant disease. Overall, micro-US targeted biopsies upgraded 2% of patients to clinically significant disease that would have been missed otherwise.  Conclusions:   MR-micro-US-fusion TR-B and TP-B have similar diagnostic yields in terms of detection rates of clinically significant prostate cancer. Micro-US targeted biopsy appears to have an additional diagnostic value over systematic and MRI-targeted biopsies.""","""['Arnas Rakauskas', 'Max Peters', 'Paul Martel', 'Peter S N van Rossum', 'Stefano La Rosa', 'Jean-Yves Meuwly', 'Beat Roth', 'Massimo Valerio']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Transperineal Versus Transrectal MRI/TRUS Fusion Targeted Biopsy: Detection Rate of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.', 'Transperineal Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Prostate Biopsy Combined with Standard Template Improves Prostate Cancer Detection.', 'Prostate Mapping for Cancer Diagnosis: The Madrid Protocol.

With advances in screening and treatment, there are now a growing number of cancer survivors with complex needs, requiring the involvement of multiple health care providers. Previous studies have identified problems related to communication and care coordination between primary care providers (PCPs) and cancer specialists.  Objective:   This study aimed to examine whether a web- and text-based asynchronous system (eOncoNote) could facilitate communication between PCPs and cancer specialists (oncologists and oncology nurses) to improve patient-reported continuity of care among patients receiving treatment or posttreatment survivorship care.  Methods:   In this pragmatic randomized controlled trial, a total of 173 patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (eOncoNote plus usual methods of communication between PCPs and cancer specialists) or a control group (usual communication only), including 104 (60.1%) patients in the survivorship phase (breast and colorectal cancer) and 69 (39.9%) patients in the treatment phase (breast and prostate cancer). The primary outcome was patient-reported team and cross-boundary continuity (Nijmegen Continuity Questionnaire). Secondary outcome measures included the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire on Major Depression, and Picker Patient Experience Questionnaire. Patients completed the questionnaires at baseline and at 2 points following randomization. Patients in the treatment phase completed follow-up questionnaires at 1 month and at either 4 months (patients with prostate cancer) or 6 months following randomization (patients with breast cancer). Patients in the survivorship phase completed follow-up questionnaires at 6 months and at 12 months following randomization.  Results:   The results did not show an intervention effect on the primary outcome of team and cross-boundary continuity of care or on the secondary outcomes of depression and patient experience with their health care. However, there was an intervention effect on anxiety. In the treatment phase, there was a statistically significant difference in the change score from baseline to the 1-month follow-up for GAD-7 (mean difference -2.3; P=.03). In the survivorship phase, there was a statistically significant difference in the change score for GAD-7 between baseline and the 6-month follow-up (mean difference -1.7; P=.03) and between baseline and the 12-month follow-up (mean difference -2.4; P=.004).  Conclusions:   PCPs' and cancer specialists' access to eOncoNote is not significantly associated with patient-reported continuity of care. However, PCPs' and cancer specialists' access to the eOncoNote intervention may be a factor in reducing patient anxiety.

Results:   Chemotherapy-naïve patients were significantly more likely to complete the full course of treatment. Median follow-up was 31 months (range 0.7-38.8 months) and median overall survival was 15.4 months (range 9.5-20.6 months). Overall survival was significantly associated with findings on bone scans (P < .05). Patients with higher BSI tended toward poorer outcomes. Nearly half the patients with low baseline BSI survived 3 years or more following Ra-223 treatment. By contrast, only 20% of the patients with high baseline BSI lived for 1 year, and none lived for an additional 3. Baseline BSI was significantly associated with decreased hemoglobin, higher serum PSA and alkaline phosphatase levels, and treatment-associated reductions in platelet and absolute neutrophil counts.

The analysis of the UV-visible spectra evidenced plasmonic peak changes for the hybrid nanoparticle-drug assembly (Pd@CisPt), which pointed to a significant interaction of CisPt with the NP surface. The drug loading was quantitatively estimated by ICP-OES measurements, while DLS and AFM confirmed the strong association of the drug with the nanoparticle surface. The test of SOD-like activity in a cell-free environment proved the maintenance of the antioxidant capability of PdNP also in the Pd@CisPt systems. Finally, Pd@CisPt tested in prostate cancer cells (PC-3 line) unveiled the antitumoral action of the developed nanomedicine, related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, with a condition of protein misfolding/unfolding and DNA damage, as evidenced by cytotoxicity and MitoSOX assays, as well as Raman microspectroscopy, respectively. Cell imaging by confocal microscopy evidenced cellular uptake of the nanoparticles, as well as dynamic processes of copper ion accumulation at the level of subcellular compartments.

A decline in the utilization of BT as a treatment modality has been observed and reported, which may impact training opportunities for medical physics residents. A survey of therapeutic medical physics residency program directors was performed as part of an assessment of the current state of BT training during residency.  Methods:   In March 2021, a survey consisting of 23 questions was designed by a working unit of the Brachytherapy Subcommittee of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and approved for distribution by the Executive Committee of the AAPM. The survey was distributed to the directors of the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Physics Education Programs (CAMPEP)-accredited therapeutic medical physics residency programs by the AAPM. The participant response was recorded anonymously in an online platform and then analyzed using MATLAB and Microsoft Excel software.  Results:   The survey was distributed to the program directors of 110 residency programs. Over the course of 6 weeks, 72 directors accessed the survey online, and 55 fully completed the survey. Individual responses from the directors (including partial submissions) were evaluated and analyzed. Nearly all participating programs (98%) utilize high dose rate BT treatments with 74% using low dose rate BT techniques. All programs treated gynecological sites using BT, and the next most common treatment sites were prostate (80%) and breast (53%). Overall, the residency program directors had a positive outlook toward BT as a radiotherapeutic treatment modality. Caseload and time limitations were identified as primary barriers to BT training by some programs.  Conclusions:   Based on the responses of the program directors, it was identified that the residency programs might benefit from additional resources such as virtual BT training, interinstitutional collaborations as well as resident fellowships. Programs might also benefit from additional guidance related to BT-specific training requirements to help program directors attest Authorized Medical Physicist eligibility for graduating residents.""","""['Manik Aima', 'Samantha J Simiele', 'Susan L Richardson', 'Christopher S Melhus']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['""Taking Training to the Next Level"": The American College of Surgeons Committee on Residency Training Survey.', 'Evaluation of Urology Residency Training and Perceived Resident Abilities in the United States.', 'International electives in neurological surgery training: a survey of program directors from Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved neurological surgery programs.', 'Benchmarks for Support and Outcomes for Internal Medicine-Pediatrics Residency Programs: A 5-Year Review.', 'Brachytherapy evolution as seen today.']"""

But the mechanisms involved were not known. Here, we investigated the effect of inhibitors on apoptosis and studied the relevant mechanisms. WtrFABP5 significantly reduced apoptotic cells in 22Rv1 and PC3 by 18% and 42%, respectively. In contrast, the chemical inhibitor SB-FI-26 produced significant increases in percentages of apoptotic cells in 22Rv1 and PC3 by 18.8% (±4.1) and 4.6% (±1.1), respectively. The bio- inhibitor dmrFABP5 also did so by 23.1% (±2.4) and 15.8% (±3.0), respectively, in these cell lines. Both FABP5 inhibitors significantly reduced the levels of the phosphorylated nuclear fatty acid receptor PPARγ, indicating that these inhibitors promoted apoptosis-induction sensitivity of the cancer cells by suppressing the biological activity of PPARγ. Thus, the phosphorylated PPARγ levels were reduced by FABP5 inhibitors, the levels of the phosphorylated AKT and activated nuclear factor kapper B (NFκB) were coordinately altered by additions of the inhibitors. These changes eventually led to the increased levels of cleaved caspase-9 and cleaved caspase-3; and thus, increase in the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. In untreated prostate cancer cells, increased FABP5 suppressed the apoptosis by increasing the biological activity of PPARγ, which, in turn, led to a reduced apoptosis by interfering with the AKT or NFκB signaling pathway. Our results suggested that the FABP5 inhibitors enhanced the apoptosis-induction of prostate cancer cells by reversing the biological effect of FABP5 and its related pathway.""","""['Jiacheng Zhang', 'Gang He', 'Xi Jin', 'Bandar T Alenezi', 'Abdulghani A Naeem', 'Saud A Abdulsamad', 'Youqiang Ke']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Biol Int""","""['Fatty acid activated PPARγ promotes tumorigenicity of prostate cancer cells by up regulating VEGF via PPAR responsive elements of the promoter.', 'Inactivated FABP5 suppresses malignant progression of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting the activation of nuclear fatty acid receptor PPARγ.', 'Inhibitor SBFI26 suppresses the malignant progression of castration-resistant PC3-M cells by competitively binding to oncogenic FABP5.', 'FABP5 regulates the proliferation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma cells via the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'The cancer-promoting gene fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5) is epigenetically regulated during human prostate carcinogenesis.']"""

Methods:   We enrolled 122 patients who were newly diagnosed with de novo bone metastatic prostate cancer following primary androgen deprivation based therapy at our institution from January 2008 to June 2021. The metastatic bone sites were classified into six sites: skull; cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae; chest (ribs and sternum); pelvis; upper limbs; and lower limbs. We calculated the bone metastatic score (BMS) for each site: 0 points were assigned for non-metastasis and 1 point was assigned for metastasis. The X-tile was adopted to acquire optimal cutoff points of BMS. We defined high-risk group (HRG) as BMS ≥ 3 and low-risk group (LRG) as BMS < 3. The new bone risk stratification was validated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Subsequently, the relevant clinical prognostic variables were added to construct a predictive nomogram for predicting CRPC.  Results:   The median patient age was 73 years. Most patients had Gleason score ≤8 (93 cases, 76.2%). The median follow-up duration was 11.5 months (range: 2-92 months). Eighty-six patients progressed to CRPC during the follow-up. The most common bone metastatic site was the pelvis (90.2%). The median BMS was 4. Seventy-six patients had HRG, while forty-six had LRG. The 1-, 2-, and 3-year AUCs for H/LRG were 0.620, 0.754, and 0.793, respectively. The HRG was associated with earlier time to CRPC. A nomogram based on four parameters (Gleason score, H/LRG, prostate-specific antigen [PSA] nadir, and time to PSA nadir) was developed to predict CRPC. Internal validation using bootstrapping demonstrated good accuracy for predicting the CRPC (C-index: 0.727). The calibration analysis demonstrated that the model performed well.  Conclusion:   We established a novel H/LRG risk model for newly diagnosed de novo bone metastatic prostate cancer, which provided evidence to support clinical decision-making.""","""['Yang Zhang#', 'Junqi Wang#', 'Li Ding', 'Yuxin Zheng', 'Chuang Wu', 'Kun Wang', 'Wentao Xia', 'Peng Ge']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Retrospective validation of bone risk stratification criteria for men with de novo metastatic hormone-naive prostate cancer in China.', 'Prediction of Time to Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using Bone Scan Index in Men with Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Predictive factor analysis of time to progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer after androgen deprivation therapy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

A deep learning-based algorithm has the potential to assist with this assessment.  Objective:   To develop and evaluate a deep learning-based algorithm for semiautomated treatment response assessment of pelvic lymph nodes.  Methods:   A total of 162 patients who had undergone at least two scans for follow-up assessment after APC metastasis treatment were enrolled. A previously reported deep learning model was used to perform automated segmentation of pelvic lymph nodes. The performance of the deep learning algorithm was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and volumetric similarity (VS). The consistency of the short diameter measurement with the radiologist was evaluated using Bland-Altman plotting. Based on the segmentation of lymph nodes, the treatment response was assessed automatically with a rule-based program according to the MET-RADS-P criteria. Kappa statistics were used to assess the accuracy and consistency of the treatment response assessment by the deep learning model and two radiologists [attending radiologist (R1) and fellow radiologist (R2)].  Results:   The mean DSC and VS of the pelvic lymph node segmentation were 0.82 ± 0.09 and 0.88 ± 0.12, respectively. Bland-Altman plotting showed that most of the lymph node measurements were within the upper and lower limits of agreement (LOA). The accuracies of automated segmentation-based assessment were 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96), 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95) and 75% (95% CI: 0.46-0.92) for target lesions, nontarget lesions and nonpathological lesions, respectively. The consistency of treatment response assessment based on automated segmentation and manual segmentation was excellent for target lesions [K value: 0.92 (0.86-0.98)], good for nontarget lesions [0.82 (0.74-0.90)] and moderate for nonpathological lesions [0.71 (0.50-0.92)].

There is now a comprehensive understanding of metabolic reprogramming as a hallmark of cancer. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is a key regulator of the lipid metabolic network, providing energy to favor tumor proliferation and development. Whereas the biological role of FASN is known, its response and sensitivity to inhibition have not yet been fully established in these two cancer settings.  Methods:   To evaluate the association between FASN expression, methylation, prognosis, and mutational profile in PDAC and PCa, we interrogated public databases and surveyed online platforms using TCGA data. The STRING database was used to investigate FASN interactors, and the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis platform Reactome database was used to perform an enrichment analysis using data from RNA sequencing public databases of PDAC and PCa. In vitro models using PDAC and PCa cell lines were used to corroborate the expression of FASN, as shown by Western blot, and the effects of FASN inhibition on cell proliferation/cell cycle progression and mitochondrial respiration were investigated with MTT, colony formation assay, cell cycle analysis and MitoStress Test.  Results:   The expression of FASN was not modulated in PDAC compared to normal pancreatic tissues, while it was overexpressed in PCa, which also displayed a different level of promoter methylation. Based on tumor grade, FASN expression decreased in advanced stages of PDAC, but increased in PCa. A low incidence of FASN mutations was found for both tumors. FASN was overexpressed in PCa, despite not reaching statistical significance, and was associated with a worse prognosis than in PDAC. The biological role of FASN interactors correlated with lipid metabolism, and GSEA indicated that lipid-mediated mitochondrial respiration was enriched in PCa. Following validation of FASN overexpression in PCa compared to PDAC in vitro, we tested TVB-2640 as a FASN inhibitor. PCa proliferation arrest was modulated by FASN inhibition in a dose- and time-dependent manner, whereas PDAC proliferation was not altered. In line with this finding, mitochondrial respiration was found to be more affected in PCa than in PDAC. FASN inhibition interfered with metabolic signaling causing lipid accumulation and affecting cell viability with an impact on the replicative processes.  Conclusions:   FASN exhibited differential expression patterns in PDAC and PCa, suggesting a different evolution during cancer progression. This was corroborated by the fact that both tumors responded differently to FASN inhibition in terms of proliferative potential and mitochondrial respiration, indicating that its use should reflect context specificity.""","""['Ugo Chianese#', 'Chiara Papulino#', 'Ahmad Ali', 'Fortunato Ciardiello', 'Salvatore Cappabianca', 'Lucia Altucci#', 'Vincenzo Carafa#', 'Rosaria Benedetti#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Up-regulation of fatty acid synthase induced by EGFR/ERK activation promotes tumor growth in pancreatic cancer.', 'P300 acetyltransferase regulates fatty acid synthase expression, lipid metabolism and prostate cancer growth.', 'Fatty acid synthase: a metabolic enzyme and candidate oncogene in prostate cancer.', 'Role of abnormal lipid metabolism in development, progression, diagnosis and therapy of pancreatic cancer.', 'Localisation of PGK1 determines metabolic phenotype to balance metastasis and proliferation in patients with SMAD4-negative pancreatic cancer.']"""

This study aimed to expound on the anatomical structure of Denonvilliers' fascia and its correlation with the peritoneum from the sagittal view and clarify the complex fascial relationship.  Methods:   Our study was performed on 20 adult male pelvic specimens fixed in formalin, including 2 entire pelvic specimens and 18 semipelvic specimens. The local adjacent organs and fasciae were dissected, and Denonvilliers' fascia was observed and removed for histological examination.  Results:   Denonvilliers' fascia was typically single-layered and tough. On the sagittal plane, the peritoneum constituting the peritoneal reflection and Denonvilliers' fascia formed a ""Y"" shape. Denonvilliers' fascia originated from the peritoneal reflection, extended along the ventral side of the seminal vesicles and prostate, continuing caudally; its bilateral sides closely connected to the urogenital fascia (UGF) of the pelvic wall. In addition, histology preliminarily indicated that the basal cell layers of the peritoneum and Denonvilliers' fascia were continuous and formed a ""Y"" shape. Furthermore, the basal cells of the two peritonea extended to Denonvilliers' fascia, creating a fused double-layered structure. Some tiny blood vessels or a network of such vessels extended from the peritoneum to Denonvilliers' fascia.  Conclusion:   Denonvilliers' fascia, the extension of the peritoneum in the pelvic floor, appears as a single-layered ""Y""-shape on the sagittal plane.

We aimed to develop a fully automated convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for calculating PET/CT skeletal tumor burden in patients with PCa.  Methods:   A total of 168 patients from three centers were divided into training, validation, and test groups. Manual annotations of skeletal lesions in [18F]fluoride PET/CT scans were used to train a CNN. The AI model was evaluated in 26 patients and compared to segmentations by physicians and to a SUV 15 threshold. PET index representing the percentage of skeletal volume taken up by lesions was estimated.  Results:   There was no case in which all readers agreed on prevalence of lesions that the AI model failed to detect. PET index by the AI model correlated moderately strong to physician PET index (mean r = 0.69). Threshold PET index correlated fairly with physician PET index (mean r = 0.49). The sensitivity for lesion detection was 65-76% for AI, 68-91% for physicians, and 44-51% for threshold depending on which physician was considered reference.  Conclusion:   It was possible to develop an AI-based model for automated assessment of PET/CT skeletal tumor burden. The model's performance was superior to using a threshold and provides fully automated calculation of whole-body skeletal tumor burden. It could be further developed to apply to different radiotracers.

Here, we perform genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in BRCA1/2-proficient prostate cancer cells and identify previously unknown genes whose loss has a profound impact on PARP inhibitor response. Specifically, MMS22L deletion, frequently observed (up to 14%) in prostate cancer, renders cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors by disrupting RAD51 loading required for homologous recombination repair, although this response is TP53-dependent. Unexpectedly, loss of CHEK2 confers resistance rather than sensitivity to PARP inhibition through increased expression of BRCA2, a target of CHEK2-TP53-E2F7-mediated transcriptional repression. Combined PARP and ATR inhibition overcomes PARP inhibitor resistance caused by CHEK2 loss.

Methods:   A prospective, single-institution, cohort study of men with PCa referred to the GTS from October 14, 2019, to October 14, 2021, was conducted.

Because GTS transitioned from an on-site to remote service during the COVID-19 pandemic, we also compared outcomes for embedded versus remote GTS.  Results:   Overall, 713 patients were referred to and eligible for GTS, and 592 (83%) patients completed germline testing. Seventy-six (13%) patients had ≥ 1 pathogenic variant. Post-GTS was independently associated with higher odds of completing testing within 60 days than pre-GTS (odds ratio, 8.97; 95% CI, 2.71 to 29.75; P < .001).

Patients and methods:   A total of 322 patients with a high genetic risk (familial or personal history of cancers or a predisposing germline variant) were included in this study. The primary outcome was the detection rates of PCa (positive biopsy) or clinically significant PCa (biopsy with International Society of Urological Pathology [ISUP] grade >1). Clinical parameters included age, body mass index, ancestry, and germline mutational status, mpMRI, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), Prostate Health Index and urinary markers (Prostate Cancer Associated 3, SelectMdx™ and T2:ERG score) were assessed. Sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for each marker at their recommended cut-off for clinical practice were calculated. Comparison between diagnoses accuracy of each procedure and scenario was computed using mutual information based and direct effect contribution using a supervised Bayesian network approach.  Results:   A mpMRI Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) score ≥3 showed higher Se than mpMRI PI-RADS score ≥4 for detection of PCa (82% vs 61%) and for the detection of ISUP grade >1 lesions (96% vs 80%). mpMRI PI-RADS score ≥3 performed better than a PSA level of ≥3 ng/mL (Se 96%, Sp 53% vs Se 91%, Sp 8%) for detection of clinically significant PCa. In case of negative mpMRI results, the supervised Bayesian network approach showed that urinary markers (with the same accuracy for all) and PSAD of ≥0.10 ng/mL/mL were the most useful indicators of decision to biopsy.  Conclusions:   We found that screening men at high genetic risk of PCa must be based on mpMRI without pre-screening based on a PSA level of >3 ng/mL, to avoid missing too many ISUP grade >1 tumours and to significantly reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. However, urinary markers or a PSAD of ≥0.10 ng/mL/mL when mpMRI was negative increased the detection of ISUP grade >1 cancers. We suggest that a baseline mpMRI be discussed for men at high genetic risk from the age of 40 years.""","""['Olivier Cussenot', 'Raphaele Renard-Penna', 'Sarah Montagne', 'Valerie Ondet', 'Antoine Pilon', 'Jerome Guechot', 'Eva Comperat', 'Freddie Hamdy', 'Alastair Lamb', 'Geraldine Cancel-Tassin']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Negative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer: further outcome and consequences.', 'The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Follow-up of Patients Included in Active Surveillance Protocol.

Materials and methods:   CRs were obtained from previously finished topic research. The mRNA expression and clinical data were acquired from TCGA and GEO datasets. Molecular subtypes were identified by ConsensusClusterPlus package. Cox regressive analyses, LASSO regressive analyses and stepAIC were utilized to screen the prognosis-related genes and establish the risk model for forecasting outcomes in prostate cancer. Genomic variation, immune infiltration, drug sensitivity difference and analysis of clinical features were all investigated.  Results:   462 samples in TCGA cohort study were classified into two clusters base on 23 prognosis CRs. Patients in cluster 1 (clust1) presented better overall survival (OS), lower tumor mutation burden (TMB), enhanced immune infiltration, higher immune escape and hyposensitivity to several drugs. Furthermore, our team smoothly established and substantiated a 10 CR-derived model for forecasting the prognostic results of individuals with prostate cancer, which was an independent prognosis indicator. Functional analyses revealed that CRs were predominantly enriched in tumor-associated signal paths. The CR-derived model was related to immunocyte infiltration and sensitive to several drugs.

Hormonal therapies inhibit gonadal testosterone production, block extragonadal androgen biosynthesis, or directly antagonize AR. Resistance to medical castration occurs as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and is driven by reactivation of the androgen-AR axis. 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (3βHSD1) serves as the rate-limiting step for potent androgen synthesis from extragonadal precursors, thereby stimulating CRPC. Genetic evidence in men demonstrates the role of 3βHSD1 in driving CRPC. In postmenopausal women, 3βHSD1 is required for synthesis of aromatase substrates and plays an essential role in breast cancer. Therefore, 3βHSD1 lies at a critical junction for the synthesis of androgens and estrogens, and this metabolic flux is regulated through germline-inherited mechanisms. We show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 344 (Y344) occurs and is required for 3βHSD1 cellular activity and generation of Δ4, 3-keto-substrates of 5α-reductase and aromatase, including in patient tissues. BMX directly interacts with 3βHSD1 and is necessary for enzyme phosphorylation and androgen biosynthesis. In vivo blockade of 3βHSD1 Y344 phosphorylation inhibits CRPC.

Therefore, the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines recommend restricting sRP to a favorable-prognosis group according to the EAU criteria, but these have been validated considering only biochemical recurrence (BCR). Our aim was to test these criteria in a large, multicenter, contemporary cohort. We retrospectively reviewed 1265 patients who underwent sRP at 14 referral centers (2000-2021), stratified by compliance with the EAU criteria. Our primary outcome was metastasis-free survival (MFS). We included 1030 men, of whom 221 (21.5%) fully met the EAU recommended criteria for sRP and 809 (78.5%) did not. The EAU-compliant group experienced more favorable pathological and functional outcomes (79% vs 63% wearing no pads at 1 yr; p < 0.001) and had significantly better MFS (90% vs 76% at 5 yr; p < 0.001), prostate-specific antigen-free survival (55% vs 38% at 5 yr; p < 0.001), and overall survival (89% vs 84% at 5 yr; p = 0.01). This was verified by Cox regression analysis for MFS (hazard ratio 1.84, 95% confidence interval 1.13-2.99; p = 0.01).

Therapeutically relevant non-steroidal or steroidal antiandrogens are able to block the AR effect by eliminating AR-mediated signalling. Herein we report the synthesis of novel steroidal pyrazoles derived from the natural sex hormone 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). 2-Ethylidene or 2-(hetero)arylidene derivatives of DHT obtained by regioselective Claisen-Schmidt condensation with acetaldehyde or (hetero)aromatic aldehydes in alkaline ethanol were reacted with monosubstituted hydrazines to give A-ring-fused 1,5-disubstituted pyrazoles as main or exclusive products, depending on the reaction conditions applied. Spontaneous or 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ)-induced oxidation of the primarily formed pyrazolines resulted in the desired products in moderate to good yields, while 17-oxidation also occurred by using the Jones reagent as a strong oxidant. Transcriptional activity of the AR in a reporter cell line was examined for all novel compounds, and several previously synthesized similar DHT-based pyrazoles with differently substituted heteroring were also included to obtain information about the structure-activity relationship. Two specific regioisomeric groups of derivatives significantly diminished the transcriptional activity of the AR in reporter cell line in 10 μM concentration, and displayed reasonable antiproliferative activity in AR-positive PCa cell lines.

Using a novel frailty index (FI) and two common frailty screening tools, we examined quality of life (QoL) and physical function (PF) in frail versus non-frail men receiving treatment for mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   Men aged 65+ starting docetaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone, or enzalutamide for mCRPC were enrolled in a multicenter prospective cohort study. QoL, fatigue, pain, and mood were measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General scale, the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System tiredness and pain subscales, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. PF was evaluated with grip strength, four-meter gait speed, five times Sit-to-Stand Test, and instrumental activities of daily living. Frailty was determined using the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13), the Geriatric 8 (G8), and an FI constructed from 36 variables spanning laboratory abnormalities, geriatric syndromes, functional status, social support, as well as emotional, cognitive, and physical deficits. We categorized patients as non-frail (FI ≤ 0.2, VES < 3, G8 > 14), pre-frail (FI > 0.20, ≤0.35), or frail (FI > 0.35, VES ≥ 3, G8 ≤ 14); assessed correlation between the three tools; and performed linear mixed-effects regression analyses to examine longitudinal differences in outcomes (0, 3, 6 months) by frailty status. A sensitivity analysis with worst-case imputation was conducted to explore attrition.  Results:   We enrolled 175 men (mean age 74.9 years) starting docetaxel (n = 71), abiraterone (n = 37), or enzalutamide (n = 67). Our FI demonstrated moderate correlation with the VES-13 (r = 0.607, p < 0.001) and the G8 (r = -0.520, p < 0.001). Baseline FI score was associated with worse QoL (p < 0.001), fatigue (p < 0.001), pain (p < 0.001), mood (p < 0.001), PF (p < 0.001), and higher attrition (p < 0.01). Over time, most outcomes remained stable, although pain improved, on average, regardless of frailty status (p = 0.007), while fatigue (p = 0.045) and mood (p = 0.015) improved in frail patients alone.  Discussion:   Among older men receiving care for mCRPC, frailty may be associated with worse baseline QoL and PF, but over time, frail patients may experience largely similar trends in QoL and PF as their non-frail counterparts. Further study with larger sample size and longer follow-up may help elucidate how best to incorporate frailty into treatment decision-making for mCRPC.""","""['Valerie S Kim', 'Helen Yang', 'Narhari Timilshina', 'Henriette Breunis', 'Urban Emmenegger', 'Richard Gregg', 'Aaron R Hansen', 'George Tomlinson', 'Shabbir M H Alibhai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Impact of treatment on elder-relevant physical function and quality of life outcomes in older adults with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Frailty and survival among veterans treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A prospective study examining elder-relevant outcomes in older adults with prostate cancer undergoing treatment with chemotherapy or abiraterone.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'What do we know about treatment sequencing of abiraterone, enzalutamide, and chemotherapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer?', 'Should clinical trials about prostate cancer assess the frailty as an endpoint?']"""

Methods:   Patients with progressive disease were randomised to ten cycles of ODX, intravenous infusion Q2W (3, 6, and 9 mg/kg, respectively). The primary objective was to assess the relative change from baseline in bone alkaline phosphatase (B-ALP) and serum-aminoterminal-propeptide of Type I procollagen (S-P1NP) at 12 weeks. The inclusion criteria selected were broad, and a double-blind design was used to ensure objective recruitment of patients for the assessment of efficacy. None of the patients received bone-protecting agents during the ODX treatment period.  Results:   Fifty-five 21,20 and 14) patients were randomised to ODX (3, 6 and 9 mg/kg), respectively.

Exosomes have been widely investigated as promising biomarkers for various diseases. We aim to characterize the proteomic and metabolomic profile of exosomes and to evaluate their potential value for the diagnosis of PCa, especially CRPC. We also investigate the functions of some specific exosome biomarkers in the progression of CRPC.  Methods:   Integrated proteomics and metabolomics analysis were performed for plasma-derived exosomes collected from tumor-free controls (TFC), PCa and CRPC patients. Expression of specific exosomal proteins were further validated by targeted 4D-parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry among the three cohorts. Tissue distribution and functional role of exosomal protein LRG1 was studied in clinical PCa tissue samples and cell line models.  Results:   Three potential exosomal protein markers were identified. The apolipoprotein E level in PCa samples was 1.7-fold higher than that in TFC (receiver operating characteristic value, 0.74). Similarly, the levels of exosome-derived leucine-rich alpha2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H3 (ITIH3) in the CRPC group were 1.7 and 2.04 times, respectively, higher than those in the PCa group (ROC values, 0.84 and 0.85, respectively), indicating that LRG1 and ITIH3 could serve as predictive markers for CRPC. For metabolomic evaluation of exosomes, a series of differentially expressed metabolites were identified, and a combined metabolite panel showed ROC value of 0.94 for distinguishing PCa from TFC and 0.97 for distinguishing CRPC from PCa. Immunohistochemistry of tissue microarray showed that LRG1 protein was significantly upregulated in advanced prostate cancer and functional assay revealed that ectopic expression of LRG1 can significantly enhance the malignant phenotype of prostate cancer cells. More importantly, PCa cell derived LRG1-overexpressed exosomes remarkably promoted angiogenesis.  Conclusion:   Integration of proteomics and metabolomics data generated proteomic and metabolic signatures of plasma exosomes that may facilitate discrimination of CRPC from PCa and TFC patients, suggesting the potential of exosomal proteins and metabolites as CRPC markers.

Methods:   The immunoproteasome subunit LMP7 was silenced by using gene knockout or inhibited by the epoxyketone inhibitor ONX 0914 in a mouse CRPC tumour graft model and in interferon-γ-pretreated human CRPC cell lines in vitro.  Results:   CRPC tissues reveal a significant ""tumour-elicited"" Th17-type inflammatory response which induces immunoproteasome subunit expression. LMP7 deficiency in host mice or in CRPC tumour grafts had no effect on the ""tumour-elicited"" Th17-type inflammatory response and tumour progression. However, the selective LMP7 inhibitor ONX 0914 strongly suppressed the ""tumour-elicited"" Th17-type inflammatory response and CRPC tumour progression. Treatment of wild-type mice receiving LMP7-deficient CRPC tumour grafts with ONX 0914 further suggested that immunoproteasome inhibition prevents CRPC progression through suppressing IL-17-induced angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition via inactivation of COX-2/VEGF-A signalling and β-catenin/Snail signalling. Treatment of LMP7-deficient mice receiving wild-type CRPC tumour grafts with ONX 0914 and inhibition of LMP7 in PC3 and 22Rv.1 cells with ONX 0914 showed that immunoproteasome inhibition also prevents CRPC progression through inducing CRPC cell apoptosis via activation of the unfolded protein response.

Aberrant overexpression of UHRF1 has been reported in several cancer types, and is regarded as a novel drug target for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, no UHRF1-targeted small molecule inhibitor has been testing in clinical trials. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions have a long history for the treatment of PCa in China, and Chinese herbal extracts are important resources for new drug discovery. In the present study, we first screened the potentially effective components from the commonly used TCMs for PCa treatment in clinic by using network pharmacology together with molecular docking. We identified diosgenin (DSG) as a small molecule natural compound specifically targeting UHRF1 protein. Furthermore, we validated the results by using the wet lab experiments. DSG, by directly binding UHRF1 protein, induced UHRF1 protein degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Importantly, DSG induced UHRF1 protein degradation by reducing the protein interaction with a deubiquitinase USP7. DSG reduced the level of genomic DNA methylation, and elevated the expression of such tumor suppressor genes as p21, p16 and LXN, thereby resulting in cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence and the inhibition of xenograft tumor growth. We here presented the first report that DSG specifically induced UHRF1 protein degradation, thereby revealing a novel anticancer mechanism of DSG.

To better diagnose the prostate cancer, prostate lesion segmentation becomes a very important work, but its progress is very slow due to the prostate lesions small in size, irregular in shape, and blurred in contour. Therefore, automatic prostate lesion segmentation from mp-MRI is a great significant work and a challenging task. However, the most existing multi-step segmentation methods based on voxel-level classification are time-consuming, may introduce errors in different steps and lead to error accumulation. To decrease the computation time, harness richer 3D spatial features, and fuse the multi-level contextual information of mp-MRI, we present an automatic segmentation method in which all steps are optimized conjointly as one step to form our end-to-end convolutional neural network. The proposed end-to-end network DMSA-V-Net consists of two parts: (1) a 3D V-Net is used as the backbone network, it is the first attempt in employing 3D convolutional neural network for CS prostate lesion segmentation, (2) a deep multi-scale attention mechanism is introduced into the 3D V-Net which can highly focus on the ROI while suppressing the redundant background. As a merit, the attention can adaptively re-align the context information between the feature maps at different scales and the saliency maps in high-levels. We performed experiments based on five cross-fold validation with data including 97 patients. The results show that the Dice and sensitivity are 0.7014 and 0.8652 respectively, which demonstrates that our segmentation approach is more significant and accurate compared to other methods.""","""['Enmin Song', 'Jiaosong Long', 'Guangzhi Ma', 'Hong Liu', 'Chih-Cheng Hung', 'Renchao Jin', 'Peijun Wang', 'Wei Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Deeply supervised 3D fully convolutional networks with group dilated convolution for automatic MRI prostate segmentation.', '3D APA-Net: 3D Adversarial Pyramid Anisotropic Convolutional Network for Prostate Segmentation in MR Images.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'VoxResNet: Deep voxelwise residual networks for brain segmentation from 3D MR images.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.']"""

The total cost of a cancer type was the sum of costs for individuals across four phases of cancer care. The projections presented in this study were generated based on a simulation of 32 million cases.

The overall number of cancer deaths is projected to increase by 44% from 2020 to 2040. More cancer deaths are projected in males than in females. The age-standardized mortality rate is expected to remain relatively stable over time. Overall cancer management costs are projected to increase from $20.6B in 2020 to $31.4B in 2040.

Methods:   IQGAP3 expression in PC was examined by immunohistochemistry and using multiple datasets. IQGAP3 network was analyzed for pathway alterations and used to construct a multigene signature (SigIQGAP3NW). SigIQGAP3NW was characterized using LNCaP cell-derived castration-resistant PCs (CRPCs), analyzed for prognostic value in 26 human cancer types, and studied for association with immune evasion.  Results:   Increases in IQGAP3 expression associated with PC tumorigenesis, tumor grade, metastasis, and p53 mutation. IQGAP3 correlative genes were dominantly involved in mitosis. IQGAP3 correlated with PLK1 and TOP2A expression at Spearman correlation/R = 0.89 (p ≤ 3.069e-169). Both correlations were enriched in advanced PCs and Taxane-treated CRPCs and occurred at high levels (R > 0.8) in multiple cancer types. SigIQGAP3NW effectively predicted cancer recurrence and poor prognosis in independent PC cohorts and across 26 cancer types. SigIQGAP3NW stratified PC recurrence after adjustment for age at diagnosis, grade, stage, and surgical margin. SigIQGAP3NW component genes were upregulated in PC, metastasis, LNCaP cell-produced CRPC, and showed an association with p53 mutation. SigIQGAP3NW correlated with immune cell infiltration, including Treg in PC and other cancers. RELT, a SigIQGAP3NW component gene, was associated with elevations of multiple immune checkpoints and the infiltration of Treg and myeloid-derived suppressor cells in PC and across cancer types.

Method:   This is a cross-sectional population-based study conducted with data from the 2003, 2008, and 2015 editions of the Health Survey of the City of São Paulo (ISA-Capital). Outcome variables were the proportion of mammography, Papanicolaou (Pap smear), and Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) tests according to the protocols. Inequality was measured by education level according to years of study. For static analysis, Poisson regression was used to estimate proportion ratios.  Results:   The proportion of Pap smears remained stationary at a high level (>89%) throughout the study period, while access to mammography and PSA tests significantly increased in the 2003‒2015 period. The present results indicate inequalities in access to cancer screening due to education, and being more expressive for mammography and PSA tests. However, this inequality significantly decreased over the period analyzed comparing the most educated individuals with those with the lowest educational level.

The incidence rate ratio (IRR), age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR), and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated. A total of 2584 patients with primary OPSCC were included (median follow-up time: 3.1 years), with 317 patients (12.3%) diagnosed with SPC. The risk of SPC was approximately five times the occurrence of cancer in the general population (IRR: 4.96). The median time to SPC after a primary OPSCC was 2.0 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 0.6-4.2 years). HPV-positive (HPV+) patients had a significantly longer median time to SPC, and a significant better survival compared to HPV-negative (HPV-) patients. SPC was most frequently found in lungs, head, and neck (LHN) for HPV- OPSCC patients and lungs followed by gender-specific (prostate, ovaries, or endometrium) for HPV+ OPSCC.

A significant challenge in designing effective drugs lies in targeting constitutively active AR variants and, most importantly, nearly all AR variants lacking the ligand-binding domain (LBD). Recent findings show that an AR's constitutive activity may occur in the presence of somatic DNA mutations within non-coding regions, but the role of these mutations remains elusive. The discovery of new drugs targeting CRPC is hampered by the limited molecular understanding of how AR binds mutated DNA sequences, frequently observed in prostate cancer, and how mutations within the protein and DNA regulate AR-DNA interactions. Using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanical calculations, we focused our efforts on (i) rationalising the role of several activating DBD mutations linked to prostate cancer, and (ii) DBD interactions in the presence of abasic DNA lesions, which frequently occur in CRPC. Our results elucidate the role of mutations within DBD through their modulation of the intrinsic dynamics of the DBD-DNA ternary complex. Furthermore, our results indicate that the DNA apurinic lesions occurring in the androgen-responsive element (ARE) enhance direct AR-DNA interactions and stabilise the DBD homodimerisation interface. Moreover, our results strongly suggest that those abasic lesions may form reversible covalent crosslinks between DNA and lysine residues of an AR via a Schiff base.

Obesity significantly increases the risk of metastatic disease and is associated with a higher mortality rate. Systemic chronic inflammation can result from a variety of conditions, including obesity, where adipose tissue inflammation is a major contributor. Adipose tissue endothelial cells (EC) exposed to inflammation become dysfunctional and produce a secretome, including extracellular vesicles (EV), that can impact function of cells in distant tissues, including malignant cells. The aim of this study was to explore the potential role of EVs produced by obese adipose tissue and the ECs exposed to pro-inflammatory cytokines on prostate cancer phenotypic plasticity in vitro. We demonstrate that PC3ML metastatic prostate cancer cells exposed to EVs from adipose tissue ECs and to EVs from human adipose tissue total explants display reduced invasion and increased proliferation. The latter functional changes could be attributed to the EV miRNA cargo. We also show that the functional shift is TWIST1-dependent and is consistent with mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition, which is key to establishment of secondary tumor growth. Understanding the complex effects of EVs on prostate cancer cells of different phenotypes is key before their intended use as therapeutics.""","""['Allison Mathiesen', 'Bronson Haynes', 'Ryan Huyck', 'Michael Brown', 'Anca Dobrian']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Obesity reduces the pro-angiogenic potential of adipose tissue stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) by impairing miR-126 content: impact on clinical applications.', 'Endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles impair the angiogenic response of coronary artery endothelial cells.', 'Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition in Human Adipose Tissue Vasculature Alters the Particulate Secretome and Induces Endothelial Dysfunction.', 'Role of adipocyte-derived extracellular vesicles in vascular inflammation.', 'Communication of prostate cancer cells with bone cells via extracellular vesicle RNA; a potential mechanism of metastasis.']"""

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol abundant in wines, grapes, berries, soybeans, and peanuts, shows a wide variety of biological effects including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated the effects of two stereoisomers of resveratrol on ANO1 activity and found that cis- and trans-resveratrol inhibited ANO1 activity with different potencies. Cis- and trans-resveratrol inhibited ANO1 channel activity with IC50 values of 10.6 and 102 μM, respectively, and had no significant effect on intracellular calcium signaling at 10 and 100 μM, respectively. In addition, cis-resveratrol downregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of ANO1 more potently than trans-resveratrol in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Cis- and trans-resveratrol significantly reduced cell proliferation and cell migration in an ANO1-dependent manner, and both resveratrol isomers strongly increased caspase-3 activity, PARP cleavage, and apoptotic sub-G1 phase ratio in PC-3 cells.

Less is known about the PA of lung cancer patients, and the strong history of smoking could influence pre-diagnosis levels of PA and place them at risk for health problems. This study aimed to compare pre-diagnosis PA and its correlates in patients with lung cancer and other types of cancer (female breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer) and examine the relationship between pre-diagnosis PA and all-cause mortality. Methods: This study used data from the UK Biobank, which is a national cohort study with accelerometry data. We included 2662 participants and used adjusted linear regressions and survival analyses. Results: Male and female lung cancer groups spent a mean of 78 and 91 min/day in pre-diagnosis moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), respectively; this is lower than the 3 other types of cancer (p < 0.001). Younger age and faster walking pace had a strong association with PA in all the four types of cancer (p < 0.01). Smoking status had a strong association with PA in the lung cancer group, while obesity had a strong association with PA in female breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer (p < 0.01). Higher levels of pre-diagnosis MVPA (≥1.5 h/day) were associated with a significantly lower all-cause mortality risk. Conclusions: The present study suggests that lung cancer patients are the most inactive population before diagnosis. The identified difference in correlates of PA suggest that cancer-specific approaches are needed in PA research and practices.

These patients expect to preserve their current quality of life and quickly recover after treatment. Medical technology and surgical techniques are advancing along with the growing expectations of patients. In addition, the universal method of assessing the quality of outcomes after operations is constantly being researched. As of today, biochemical remission alone, after radical prostatectomy, is insufficient for the patient. Therefore, multi-parametric evaluation methods are being developed, such as trifecta, which assesses biochemical remission, continence, and erectile function. The improvement over the trifecta is the pentafecta, which additionally evaluates postoperative complications and infiltration of surgical margins. Our study was conducted within a group of patients who were surgically treated for prostate cancer in 2017 at the Clinic of Urology and Urological Oncology of the Pomeranian Medical University. We recruited 237 men for the study. From that group, 131 men met the criteria to be included in the analysis. Maintaining continence (87.78%) is the easiest pentafecta parameter to obtain and will have the greatest impact on quality of life in the future. Maintaining biochemical remission (82.44%) is the second most important aspect for the patient. Retaining erectile function is the most difficult pentafecta parameter to obtain (29.01%) while having little impact on the quality of life. Negative surgical margins (66.41%) showed a negligible impact on the quality of life.

Cancer cells have high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and easily adapt to this circumstance and avoid cell death by increasing antioxidant defenses. We knocked out the NEK6 gene and evaluated the redox state and DNA damage response in DU-145 cells. The knockout of NEK6 decreases the clonogenic capacity, proliferation, cell viability, and mitochondrial activity. Targeting the NEK6 gene increases the level of intracellular ROS; decreases the expression of antioxidant defenses (SOD1, SOD2, and PRDX3); increases JNK phosphorylation, a stress-responsive kinase; and increases DNA damage markers (p-ATM and γH2AX). The exogenous overexpression of NEK6 also increases the expression of these same antioxidant defenses and decreases γH2AX. The depletion of NEK6 also induces cell death by apoptosis and reduces the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein. NEK6-lacking cells have more sensitivity to cisplatin. Additionally, NEK6 regulates the nuclear localization of NF-κB2, suggesting NEK6 may regulate NF-κB2 activity. Therefore, NEK6 alters the redox balance, regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins and DNA damage, and its absence induces the death of DU-145 cells.

The Hsp90 chaperone stabilizes an array of signaling client proteins, thus is an enabler of the malignant phenotype. Here, using different prostate cancer cell lines, we report that Hsp90 ensures PKD3 conformational stability and function to promote cancer cell migration. We found that pharmacological inhibition of either PKDs or Hsp90 dose-dependently abrogated the migration of DU145 and PC3 metastatic prostate cancer cells. Hsp90 inhibition by ganetespib caused a dose-dependent depletion of PKD2, PKD3, and Akt, which are all involved in metastasis formation. Proximity ligation assay and immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between Hsp90 and PKD3. Inhibition of the chaperone-client interaction induced misfolding and proteasomal degradation of PKD3. PKD3 siRNA combined with ganetespib treatment demonstrated a specific involvement of PKD3 in DU145 and PC3 cell migration, which was entirely dependent on Hsp90. Finally, ectopic expression of PKD3 enhanced migration of non-metastatic LNCaP cells in an Hsp90-dependent manner.

Although an increase in oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation was already associated with prostate cancer progression a few decades ago, the knowledge of the involvement of 4-HNE in prostate cancer tumorigenesis is limited. This study investigated the appearance of 4-HNE-protein adducts in prostate cancer tissue by immunohistochemistry using a genuine 4-HNE monoclonal antibody. Plasma samples of the same patients and samples of the healthy controls were also analyzed for the presence of 4-HNE-protein adducts, followed by metabolic profiling using LC-ESI-QTOF-MS and GC-EI-Q-MS. Finally, the analysis of the metabolic pathways affected by 4-HNE was performed. The obtained results revealed the absence of 4-HNE-protein adducts in prostate carcinoma tissue but increased 4-HNE-protein levels in the plasma of these patients. Metabolomics revealed a positive association of different long-chain and medium-chain fatty acids with the presence of prostate cancer. Furthermore, while linoleic acid positively correlated with the levels of 4-HNE-protein adducts in the blood of healthy men, no correlation was obtained for cancer patients indicating altered lipid metabolism in this case. The metabolic pathway of unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis emerged as significantly affected by 4-HNE. Overall, this is the first study linking 4-HNE adduction to plasma proteins with specific alterations in the plasma metabolome of prostate cancer patients. This study revealed that increased 4-HNE plasma protein adducts could modulate the unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis pathway.

Demethoxycurcumin (Curcumin II) and three of the monocarbonyl curcumin analogues exhibited the highest inhibitory activity towards hGSTP1-1 with IC50 values ranging between 5.45 ± 1.08 and 37.72 ± 1.02 μM. Kinetic inhibition studies of the most potent inhibitors demonstrated that they function as non-competitive/mixed-type inhibitors. These compounds were also evaluated for their toxicity against the prostate cancer cells DU-145. Interestingly, the strongest hGSTP1-1 inhibitor, (DM96), exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with an IC50 of 8.60 ± 1.07 μΜ, while the IC50 values of the rest of the compounds ranged between 44.59-48.52 μΜ. Structural analysis employing molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and binding-free-energy calculations was performed to study the four most potent curcumin analogues as hGSTP1-1 inhibitors. According to the obtained computational results, DM96 exhibited the lowest binding free energy, which is in agreement with the experimental data. All studied curcumin analogues were found to form hydrophobic interactions with the residue Gln52, as well as hydrogen bonds with the nearby residues Gln65 and Asn67. Additional hydrophobic interactions with the residues Phe9 and Val36 as well as π-π stacking interaction with Phe9 contributed to the superior inhibitory activity of DM96. The van der Waals component through shape complementarity was found to play the most important role in DM96-inhibitory activity. Overall, our results revealed that the monocarbonyl curcumin derivative DM96 acts as a strong hGSTP1-1 inhibitor, exerts high prostate cancer cell cytotoxicity, and may, therefore, be exploited for the suppression and chemosensitization of cancer cells.

This phase 1 study evaluated intravenous V937±pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors.  Methods:   Patients had advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), urothelial cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, or melanoma in part A (V937 monotherapy), and metastatic NSCLC or urothelial cancer in part B (V937+pembrolizumab). Prior immunotherapy was permitted >28 days before study treatment. Patients received intravenous V937 on days 1, 3, and 5 (also on day 8 in part B) of the first 21-day cycle and on day 1 of subsequent cycles for eight cycles. Three ascending dose-escalation cohorts were studied. Dose-escalation proceeded if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in cycle 1 of the previous cohort. In part B, patients also received pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks from day 8 for 2 years; dose-expansion occurred at the highest-dose cohort. Serial biopsies were performed.  Results:   No DLTs occurred in parts A (n=18) or B (n=85). Grade 3-5 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were not observed in part A and were experienced by 10 (12%) patients in part B. The most frequent treatment-related AEs (any grade) in part B were fatigue (36%), pruritus (18%), myalgia (14%), diarrhea (13%), pyrexia (13%), influenza-like illness (12%), and nausea (12%). At the highest tested dose, median intratumoral V937 concentrations were 117,631 copies/mL on day 8, cycle 1 in part A (n=6) and below the detection limit for most patients (86% (19/22)) on day 15, cycle 1 in part B.

However, by implementing evidence-based prevention strategies, 30%-50% of cancers can be detected early with improved outcomes. At the integrated cancer prevention center (ICPC), we aimed to increase early detection by screening for multiple cancers during one visit.  Methods:   Self-referred asymptomatic individuals, age 20-80 years, were included prospectively. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological data were obtained by multiple specialists, and further testing was obtained based on symptoms, family history, individual risk factors, and abnormalities identified during the visit. Follow-up recommendations and diagnoses were given as appropriate.  Results:   Between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2019, 8,618 men and 8,486 women, average age 47.11 ± 11.71 years, were screened. Of 259 cancers detected through the ICPC, 49 (19.8%) were stage 0, 113 (45.6%) stage I, 30 (12.1%) stage II, 25 (10.1%) stage III, and 31(12.5%) stage IV. Seventeen cancers were missed, six of which were within the scope of the ICPC. Compared with the Israeli registry, at the ICPC, less cancers were diagnosed at a metastatic stage for breast (none v 3.7%), lung (6.7% v 11.4%), colon (20.0% v 46.2%), prostate (5.6% v 10.5%), and cervical/uterine (none v 8.5%) cancers. When compared with the average stage of detection in the United States, detection was earlier for breast, lung, prostate, and female reproductive cancers. Patient satisfaction rate was 8.35 ± 1.85 (scale 1-10).  Conclusion:   We present a proof of concept study for a one-stop-shop approach to cancer screening in a multidisciplinary outpatient clinic.

While modern physics-based dose algorithms must compromise accuracy to achieve low computation times, deep learning models can potentially perform dose prediction tasks with both high fidelity and speed.  Purpose:   We present a deep learning algorithm that, exploiting synergies between transformer and convolutional layers, accurately predicts broad photon beam dose distributions in few milliseconds.  Methods:   The proposed improved Dose Transformer Algorithm (iDoTA) maps arbitrary patient geometries and beam information (in the form of a 3D projected shape resulting from a simple ray tracing calculation) to their corresponding 3D dose distribution. Treating the 3D CT input and dose output volumes as a sequence of 2D slices along the direction of the photon beam, iDoTA solves the dose prediction task as sequence modeling. The proposed model combines a Transformer backbone routing long-range information between all elements in the sequence, with a series of 3D convolutions extracting local features of the data. We train iDoTA on a dataset of 1700 beam dose distributions, using 11 clinical volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans (from prostate, lung, and head and neck cancer patients with 194-354 beams per plan) to assess its accuracy and speed.  Results:   iDoTA predicts individual photon beams in ≈50 ms with a high gamma pass rate of 97.72 ± 1.93 % $97.72\pm 1.93\%$ (2 mm, 2%). Furthermore, estimating full VMAT dose distributions in 6-12 s, iDoTA achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 99.51 ± 0.66 % $99.51\pm 0.66\%$ (2 mm, 2%) pass rate and an average relative dose error of 0.75 ± 0.36%.  Conclusions:   Offering the millisecond speed prediction per beam angle needed in online and real-time adaptive treatments, iDoTA represents a new state of the art in data-driven photon dose calculation. The proposed model can massively speed-up current photon workflows, reducing calculation times from few minutes to just a few seconds.""","""['Oscar Pastor-Serrano', 'Peng Dong', 'Charles Huang', 'Lei Xing', 'Zoltán Perkó']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Millisecond speed deep learning based proton dose calculation with Monte Carlo accuracy.', 'Attention-aware 3D U-Net convolutional neural network for knowledge-based planning 3D dose distribution prediction of head-and-neck cancer.', 'Treatment planning for radiotherapy with very high-energy electron beams and comparison of VHEE and VMAT plans.', 'TransDose: a transformer-based UNet model for fast and accurate dose calculation for MR-LINACs.', 'Influence of the jaw tracking technique on the dose calculation accuracy of small field VMAT plans.']"""

Objective:   To examine associations between neighborhood deprivation, circulating immune-oncology markers, and prostate cancer among African American and European American men.  Design, setting, and participants:   A case-control study was conducted between January 1, 2005, and January 1, 2016. Participants included men with prostate cancer and age- and race-frequency-matched population controls. Participants were recruited at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center and University of Maryland Medical Center; controls were obtained through the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration database. National Death Index follow-up was performed through December 31, 2020, and data analysis was conducted from February 1, 2022, through October 31, 2022.  Exposures:   2000 Census-tract Neighborhood Deprivation Index as a standardized score.  Main outcomes and measures:   Primary outcomes included prostate cancer, all-cause mortality, and disease-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes included the National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk score and serum proteomes for 82 immune-oncology markers with pathway annotation.  Results:   Participants included men with prostate cancer (n = 769: 405 African American, 364 European American men) and age- and race-frequency-matched population controls (n = 1023: 479 African American, 544 European American men). The median survival follow-up was 9.70 years (IQR, 5.77 years), with 219 deaths. Among 884 African American men, mean (SD) age at recruitment was 63.8 (7.6) years; mean (SD) age at recruitment among 908 European American men was 66.4 (8.1) years. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis with individual socioeconomic status adjustment, neighborhood deprivation was associated with 55% increased odds of prostate cancer among African American men (odds ratio [OR], 1.55; 95% CI, 1.33-1.81), but was not associated with the disease among European American men. Residing in the most-deprived vs least-deprived neighborhoods corresponded to 88% higher disease odds (OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.30-2.75) among all men and an approximate 3-fold increase among African American men (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.72-7.45), but no association was noted among European American men. In Cox proportional hazard regression analyses, socioeconomic status-adjusted neighborhood deprivation was associated with an increased all-cause mortality only among African American men (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.08-1.53), whereas it was associated with metastatic disease and a 50% increased hazard of a prostate cancer-specific death among all men (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.07-2.09). In analyses restricted to controls, neighborhood deprivation was associated with increased activity scores of serum proteome-defined chemotaxis, inflammation, and tumor immunity suppression.  Conclusions and relevance:   The findings of this study suggest that deprived neighborhood residency may increase the risk of African American men for prostate cancer and a related mortality, potentially through its association with systemic immune function and inflammation.""","""['Margaret S Pichardo', 'Tsion Zewdu Minas', 'Catherine M Pichardo', 'Maeve Bailey-Whyte', 'Wei Tang', 'Tiffany H Dorsey', 'William Wooten', 'Brid M Ryan', 'Christopher A Loffredo', 'Stefan Ambs']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.', 'Neighborhood and Individual Socioeconomic Disadvantage and Survival Among Patients With Nonmetastatic Common Cancers.', 'Association of Prostate-Specific Antigen Velocity With Clinical Progression Among African American and Non-Hispanic White Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', 'Joint Associations of Race, Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status With Mortality in the Multiethnic Cohort Study.', 'Do African American men have lower survival from prostate cancer compared with White men?

Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of the extended PU preservation (EPUP).  Aims:   To describe the histologic features of the PU.  Methods:   The PU was evaluated using cystoprostatectomy and RALP specimens. Cases of PU infiltration by prostate cancer or distortion by benign hyperplastic nodules were excluded. The thickness of the chorion and distance between the urothelium and prostate glands were measured. Prostate-specific antigen expression in the PU epithelium was evaluated with immunohistochemistry. Descriptive statistics were used.  Results:   Six specimens of PU were examined. Histologically, the following layers of the PU were observed: (1) urothelium with basal membrane, (2) chorion, and (3) prostatic peri-urethral fibromuscular tissue. The chorion measures between 0.2 and 0.4 mm. There is not a distinct urethral muscle layer, but rather muscular fibers that originate near the prostatic stroma and are distributed around the PU. This muscular tissue appears to be mainly represented in the basal and apical urethra, but not in the middle urethra. The mean distance between the chorion and prostatic glands is 1.74 mm, with significant differences between base of the prostate, middle urethral portion, and apex (2.5 vs. 1.49 vs. 1.23 mm, respectively). PSA-expressing cells are abundant in the PU epithelium, coexisting with urothelial cells.

Recently, the general relevance of their roles and clinical values in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and recurrence have been increasingly highlighted. However, there has been no specific systematic study to elucidate any potential clinical significance for these tRFs in prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), one of the most common and malignant cancers that threatens male health worldwide. Here, we investigate the clinical value of 5'-tRFs in PRAD.  Methods:   Small RNA sequencing data were analyzed to discover new 5'-tRFs biomarkers for PRAD. Machine learning algorithms were used to identify 5'-tRF classifiers to distinguish PRAD tumors from normal tissues. LASSO and Cox regression analyses were used to construct 5'-tRF prognostic predictive models. NMF and consensus clustering analyses were performed on 5'-tRF profiles to identify molecular subtypes of PRAD.  Results:   The overall levels of 5'-tRFs were significantly upregulated in the PRAD tumor samples compared to their adjacent normal samples. tRF classifiers composed of 13 5'-tRFs achieved AUC values as high as 0.963, showing high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing PRAD tumors from normal samples. Multiple 5'-tRFs were identified as being associated with the PRAD prognosis. The tRF score, defined by a set of eight 5'-tRFs, was highly predictive of survival in PRAD patients. The combination of tRF and Gleason scores showed a significantly better performance than the Gleason score alone, suggesting that 5'-tRFs can offer PRAD patients additional and improved prognostic information. Four molecular subtypes of the PRAD tumor were identified based on their 5'-tRF expression profiles.

Methods:   Ten patients with localized prostate cancer included in the ProRegPros study and treated at our center were investigated. All patients underwent placement of hydrogel rectum spacers before planning. Two planning CTs (with and without 120 cm3 fluid-filled ERB) were applied for each patient. Dose prescription was set according to the h strategy, with 72 Gray (Gy)/2.4 Gy/5× weekly to prostate + 1 cm of the seminal vesicle, and 60 Gy/2 Gy/5× weekly to prostate + 2 cm of the seminal vesicle. Planning with two laterally opposed IMPT beams was performed in both CTs. Rectal dosimetry values including dose-volume statistics and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) were compared for both plans (non-ERB plans vs. ERB plans).  Results:   For ERB plans compared with non-ERB, the reductions were 8.51 ± 5.25 Gy (RBE) (p = 0.000) and 15.76 ± 11.11 Gy (p = 0.001) for the mean and the median rectal doses, respectively. No significant reductions in rectal volumes were found after high dose levels. The use of ERB resulted in significant reduction in rectal volume after receiving 50 Gy (RBE), 40 Gy (RBE), 30 Gy (RBE), 20 Gy (RBE), and 10 Gy (RBE) with p values of 0.034, 0.008, 0.003, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively. No differences between ERB and non-ERB plans for the anterior rectum were observed. ERB reduced posterior rectal volumes in patients who received 30 Gy (RBE), 20 Gy (RBE), or 10 Gy (RBE), with p values of 0.019, 0.003, and 0.001, respectively. According to the NTCP models, no significant reductions were observed in mean or median rectal toxicity (late rectal bleeding ≥ 2, necrosis or stenosis, and late rectal toxicity ≥ 3) when using the ERB.  Conclusion:   ERB reduced rectal volumes exposed to intermediate or low dose levels. However, no significant reduction in rectal volume was observed in patients receiving high or intermediate doses. There was no benefit and also no disadvantage associated with the use of ERB for late rectal toxicity, according to available NTCP models.""","""['Dalia Ahmad Khalil', 'Jörg Wulff', 'Danny Jazmati', 'Dirk Geismar', 'Christian Bäumer', 'Paul-Heinz Kramer', 'Theresa Steinmeier', 'Stefanie Schulze Schleithoff', 'Stephan Tschirdewahn', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Beate Timmermann']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['Dosimetric feasibility of moderately hypofractionated/dose escalated radiation therapy for localised prostate cancer with intensity-modulated proton beam therapy using simultaneous integrated boost (SIB-IMPT) and impact of hydrogel prostate-rectum spacer.', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological impact of intensity modulated proton therapy and RapidArc planning for high-risk prostate cancer with seminal vesicles.', 'Helical tomotherapy vs. intensity-modulated proton therapy for whole pelvis irradiation in high-risk prostate cancer patients: dosimetric, normal tissue complication probability, and generalized equivalent uniform dose analysis.', 'Hydrogel rectum-prostate spacers mitigate the uncertainties in proton relative biological effectiveness associated with anterior-oblique beams.', 'Comprehensive review of the use of hydrogel spacers prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.']"""

In this study we calculated the model score from the leading clinical multivariable model, PREDICT prostate, and the poor prognosis DESNT molecular subtype, in a combined expression and clinical dataset that were taken from malignant tissue at prostatectomy (n = 359). Both PREDICT score (p < 0.0001, IQR HR = 1.59) and DESNT score (p < 0.0001, IQR HR = 2.08) were significant predictors for time to biochemical recurrence. A joint model combining the continuous PREDICT and DESNT score (p < 0.0001, IQR HR = 1.53 and 1.79, respectively) produced a significantly improved predictor than either model alone (p < 0.001). An increased probability of mortality after diagnosis, as estimated by PREDICT, was characterised by upregulation of cell-cycle related pathways and the downregulation of metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.

The aim of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility of intraoperative 3D-TRUS-mpMRI elastic fusion imaging to guide RARP and to evaluate its impact on the surgical strategy.  Methods:   We prospectively enrolled 11 patients with organ-confined mpMRI-visible prostate cancer (PCa), histologically confirmed at transperineal fusion biopsy using Koelis Trinity. Before surgery, the 3D model of the prostate generated at biopsy was updated, showing both mpMRI lesions and positive biopsy cores, and was displayed on the Da Vinci robotic console using TilePro™ function.  Results:   Intraoperative 3D modeling was feasible in all patients (median of 6 min). The use of 3D models led to a major change in surgical strategy in six cases (54%), allowing bilateral instead of monolateral NS, or monolateral NS instead of non-NS, to be performed. At pathologic examination, no positive surgical margins (PSMs) were reported. Bilateral PCa presence was detected in one (9%), four (36%), and nine (81%) patients after mpMRI, biopsy, and RARP, respectively. Extracapsular extension was found in two patients (18%) even if it was not suspected at MRI.  Conclusions:   Intraoperative 3D-TRUS-mpMRI modeling with Koelis Trinity is feasible and reliable, helping the surgeon to maximize functional outcomes without increasing the risk of positive surgical margins. The location of positive biopsy cores must be registered in 3D models, given the rates of bilateral involvement not seen at mpMRI.""","""['Marco Oderda', 'Giorgio Calleris', ""Daniele D'Agate"", 'Marco Falcone', 'Riccardo Faletti', 'Marco Gatti', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Alessandro Marquis', 'Paolo Gontero']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['Augmented-reality robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using hyper-accuracy three-dimensional reconstruction (HA3D™) technology: a radiological and pathological study.', 'The Role of 3D Models Obtained from Multiparametric Prostate MRI in Performing Robotic Prostatectomy.', 'MRI Displays the Prostatic Cancer Anatomy and Improves the Bundles Management Before Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Real-time Augmented Reality Three-dimensional Guided Robotic Radical Prostatectomy: Preliminary Experience and Evaluation of the Impact on Surgical Planning.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.']"""

Methods:   The records of 336 patients who harbored de novo high-risk mHSPC, based on the LATITUDE criteria, and had received ADT with either DOC (n = 109) or ABI (n = 227) were retrospectively analyzed. Overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), progression-free survival (PFS), including time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), time to 2nd-line progression (PFS2), and 2nd- and 3rd-line PFS, were compared. We used one-to-two propensity score matching to minimize the confounders. The differential efficacy of 2nd-line therapy based on agents in each arm was evaluated using the unmatched cohort as an additional interest.  Results:   After propensity score matching, 86 patients treated with DOC + ADT and 172 with ABI + ADT were available for analyses. The 3-year OS and CSS for DOC versus ABI were 76.2% versus 75.1% (p = 0.8) and 78.2% versus 78.6% (p = 1), respectively. There was no difference in the median PFS2 (49 vs. 43 months, p = 0.39), while the median time to CRPC in patients treated with ABI was significantly longer compared to those treated with DOC (42 vs. 22 months; p = 0.006). The median 2nd-line PFS (14 vs. 4 months, p < 0.001) and 3rd-line PFS (4 vs. 2 months, p = 0.012) were significantly better in the DOC group than in the ABI group. Among the unmatched cohort, after ABI for mHSPC, the median 2nd-line PFS did not differ between the patients treated with DOC and those treated with enzalutamide as 2nd-line therapy (both 3 months, p = 0.8).  Conclusions:   ADT with DOC or ABI has comparable oncologic outcomes in terms of OS, CSS, and PFS2 in patients with de novo high-risk mHSPC.

However, the response of PCa cells may depend on the anti‑androgen used and often patients become resistant to treatment. Thus, studying how the anti‑androgen drugs affect oncogenes expression and action and the identification of the best strategy for combined therapies are essential to improve the efficacy of treatments. The Six Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1 (STEAP1) is an oncogene associated with PCa progression and aggressiveness, although its relationship with the androgen receptor signaling remains to be elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of anti‑androgens in regulating STEAP1 expression and investigate whether silencing STEAP1 can make PCa cells more sensitive to anti‑androgen drugs. For this purpose, wild‑type and STEAP1 knockdown LNCaP cells were exposed to bicalutamide, enzalutamide and apalutamide. Bicalutamide decreased the expression of STEAP1, but enzalutamide and apalutamide increased its expression. However, decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis was observed in response to all drugs. Overall, the cellular and molecular effects were similar between LNCaP wild‑type and LNCaP‑STEAP1 knockdown cells, except for c‑myc expression levels, where a cumulative effect between anti‑androgen treatment and STEAP1 knockdown was observed. The effect of STEAP1 knockdown alone or combined with anti‑androgens in c‑myc levels is required to be addressed in future studies.""","""['Sandra M Rocha', 'Daniel Nascimento', 'Ana Margarida Cardoso', 'Luís Passarinha', 'Sílvia Socorro', 'Cláudio J Maia']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Med Rep""","""['STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Knockdown of STEAP1 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells counteracting the effect of androgens.', 'Comparison of the effect of the antiandrogen apalutamide (ARN-509) versus bicalutamide on the androgen receptor pathway in prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Androgen Receptor Targeted Treatments of Prostate Cancer: 35 Years of Progress with Antiandrogens.', 'Bicalutamide dosages used in the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.']"""

In this study, we looked at whether or not a petiole extract of Eichhornia crassipes preserved in methanol inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer (PC3) cell lines.  Materials and methods:   Lakes in Ezhikkara, Ernakulum, Kerala, were the source of E. crassipes. Soxhlet extraction was used to create the extract. 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to determine the cell viability of methanolic petiole extract at various concentrations. Mean and standard deviation was used to determine absorbance scores. Utilizing probit analysis, we determined the IC50 value. The descriptive statistics to measure the percent of viable cells along with the regression equation were calculated using SPSS.  Results:   It has been shown that the methanol extract significantly impacted PC3 cell lines' capacity to survive. It was also determined that increasing the medication concentration resulted in a decrease in cell viability. The percentage of living cells was measured after being exposed to methanol extracts at concentrations of 12.5 μg/ml, 25 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, 100 μg/ml, and 200 μg/ml, and found to be 95.13, 85.88, 76.12, 64.33, and 53.62 percent, respectively. With IC50 values of 199.488 g/ml, it was shown that methanolic petiole extracts of E. crassipes are cytotoxic. Using probit analysis, we determined that the regression equation is y = -0.2051x + 90.915, with an R2 value of 0.893.  Conclusion:   As a result of its chemotherapeutic properties, the E. crassipes petiole extract has the potential to be employed in therapeutic applications, with the ultimate goal of bettering prostate cancer management practices and clinical results by drastically lowering cell viability.

Studies have indicated that prostate cancer patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) are at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and serious complications compared with patients without ADT, but data are inconsistent.  Methods:   A total of 655 prostate cancer patients who were under surveillance at two urology departments in Sweden on April 1, 2020 were included in the study as well as 240 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). At follow-up early in 2021, the participants completed a questionnaire containing information about symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Blood samples were also collected for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (SARS-CoV-2 Total; Siemens).

Differences in age, PSA level, Gleason score, prostate volume, body mass index, clinical stage, lower abdominal operation history, and lymph node dissection ratio between the two groups were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). All operations were performed by the same operator. In this study, all 259 operations were completed successfully, and there was no conversion. There was no significant difference in transperitoneal blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, positive rate of incision margin, indwelling time of urinary catheter, satisfaction rate of immediate urine control, satisfaction rate of urine control 3 months after operation, positive rate of postoperative lymph node pathology or postoperative pathological stage between the two groups (P > 0.05). There were significant differences in operation time, postoperative exhaust time and incision length (P < 0.05). The modified extraperitoneal nonspecial PORT single-incision technique is safe and feasible for robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, and its curative effect is similar to that of transperitoneal multi-incision RARP. It has the advantages of a short operation time, less impact on the gastrointestinal tract and a more beautiful incision. The long-term effect of treatment needs to be further confirmed by prospective studies.""","""['Shangqing Ren#', 'Yong Ou#', 'Yaoqian Wang#', 'Yi Wei', 'Cheng Luo', 'Bo Yang', 'Jiazheng Yuan', 'Qian Lv', 'Fang Zhou', 'Zhengjun Chen', 'Yu Nie', 'Jie Lin', 'Yilei Wu', 'Bo Yang', 'Shida Fan', 'Dong Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Comparison of single incision robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with and without extraperitoneal special channel device.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy: A prospective single surgeon randomized comparative study.', 'Extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy through single incision: Establishment and application of a modified channel.', 'Transperitoneal versus extraperitoneal robot-assisted radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

Here we characterise the safety of these agents in subpopulations and assess manageability of key adverse events (AEs).  Materials and methods:   In this randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial, patients with previously untreated asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mCRPC were randomised 1:1 to receive ipatasertib-abiraterone or placebo-abiraterone (all with prednisone/prednisolone). AEs were analysed, focusing on key AEs of diarrhoea, hyperglycaemia, rash and transaminase increased.  Results:   1097 patients received study medication and were assessed for safety (47% with PTEN-loss tumours by immunohistochemistry and 20% were Asian). Ipatasertib was associated with increased Grade 3/4 AEs and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation vs placebo. The rate of discontinuation of ipatasertib was 18% in patients with PTEN-loss and 21% overall. The frequencies of all-grade, Grade 3/4 and serious AEs were similar between the PTEN-loss and overall populations. Diarrhoea, hyperglycaemia, rash and transaminase elevation were more frequent in ipatasertib-treated patients, appearing rapidly after treatment initiation (median onset: 8-43 days for ipatasertib arm and 56-104 days for placebo). The ipatasertib discontinuation rate was 32% and 18% in Asian and non-Asian patients, respectively, despite similar baseline characteristics and Grade 3/4 AE frequencies between groups.  Conclusions:   Ipatasertib plus abiraterone had an overall tolerable safety profile consistent with known toxicities.

It has a long latency period, which provides time for preventive strategies like incorporating healthy eating habits. Yerba mate (YM) intake has been associated with numerous health benefits. Since YM is one of the most popular infusions in Argentina, the of this study was to examine the influence of YM on PCa development.  Methods:   We carried out an in vivo model of PCa through subcutaneous inoculation of transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate-C1 cells in C57BL/6 mice. Subsequently, the animals were divided into two groups: mate (25 mg/mL of YM in drinking water, n = 15), and control (only drinking water, n = 15). We also developed an in vitro model to study the direct effects of YM on three human PCa cell lines: lymph node carcinoma of the prostate (LNCaP), PC-3, and DU-145.  Results:   Our in vivo model showed that YM intake slightly reduced body weight, increased the latency of tumor appearance (P <0.01), and diminished the tumor volume (P <0.05) compared with the control group. In agreement, the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and nuclear estrogen receptor α were lower in the tumors of the mate animals (P <0.05). In vitro, YM decreased the viability, proliferation, and adhesion of the three tumor cell lines (P < 0.001) and retarded the migration of LNCaP (P <0.05) and DU-145 (P <0.005), without modifying the migration of PC-3 cells.

Setting: Population-based sample recruited from two cancer registries. Patients: Black and white men with newly diagnosed LPC. Instrument: Mailed survey. Main Outcome Measure: Initial treatment choice (AS vs. curative treatment). Results: Of the 1688 eligible patients, 925 (54.8%) recruited from metro-Detroit and 763 (45.2%) from Georgia. Overall, 79.4% were White and 20.6% were Black, with a mean age of 62.8 years (SD=6.9, range 39-78). Regarding initial treatment choice, 56.9% of men chose AS, 23.4% surgery, 16.6% radiation, 1.1% watchful waiting, and 1.7% other treatment. In multivariable analysis, men who reported that their Urologist recommended AS were 56 times more likely to choose AS (OR=56, 95%CI 33-94) compared to men who reported that their Urologist recommended treatment. Similarly, men who reported that the decision was made jointly by doctor and patient or predominately by doctor, were about 2 times more likely to choose AS (OR=1.9, 95%CI 1.2-3.0) compared to men who made the decision alone. Men who believed their ""cancer is small"", had better health, higher yearly income (>=$70,000), higher prostate cancer knowledge, higher decisional conflict, and lived in metro-Detroit, were more likely to choose AS.

Objective: Describe findings from qualitative interviews with cancer specialists on implementation of an online communication system with PCPs. Study Design: Hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study that included a qualitative research component and a pragmatic RCT.

Intervention: Cancer-specific adaptation of Champlain BASE™ eConsult, an online communication system for PCPs and cancer specialists called ""eOncoNote"". For patients receiving treatment for prostate or breast cancer, cancer specialists had an opportunity to participate in eOncoNote discussion with PCP for 4-6 months; for breast and colorectal cancer survivors, the eOncoNote discussion lasted for 1 year post discharge to the patient's PCP. Results: Cancer specialists described limited PCP involvement in cancer care while patients received active treatment, with one-way communication and notes being ""sent into a vacuum"". There was more communication with PCPs regarding patients with metastatic disease, comorbid conditions, after patients have completed treatment, or during palliative care. Patients and caregivers play a critical role in coordinating cancer care, helping to facilitate coordination. Lack of access to the same electronic medical record (EMR) among healthcare providers poses a barrier to cancer care coordination. eOncoNote had the potential to be useful tool but it was not used extensively.

After complete characterization, in vitro and in vivo properties were studied.  Results:   The [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SC691-R possesses a high radiochemical yield (98-99%). The internalization values of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SC691-H, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SC691-Cl, and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SC691-Br in LNCaP cells all displayed time-dependent pattern enhanced with time. The results of in vitro competitive inhibition assay showed that the affinity of natGa-DOTA-SC691-R for PSMA had a trend of H < F < Cl < Br < I. The blocking imaging and dynamic imaging on micro-PET/CT of male non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice with LNCaP tumors showed the rapid tumor targeting properties of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SC691-R with specificity for PSMA. Static imaging of micro-PEC/CT of these compounds could rapidly localize LNCaP tumors with decent image quality (except for [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-SC691-H).

Materials and Methods: To do this research, Wharton's jelly stem cells and DU145 cancer cell line were cultured. After cell culture, the effect of Wharton's jelly on this cell line was evaluated by scratching and MTT assay. The expression of CXCR4 and VLA-4 genes was also evaluated by Real-time PCR. Results: The results of MTT and Scratching tests showed that Wharton's jelly inhibited the growth of DU145 cancer cells and also decreased the expression level of CXCR4 and VLA-4 genes.

Results:   Twenty-two participants took part in a semistructured interview comprising men who had completed the program (n = 16) and health professionals/service stakeholders involved in program delivery (n = 6). Acceptability of this virtual prostate cancer survivorship care program was very high across all constructs of the TFA, from the perspectives of both program recipients and those delivering the program. The quality of care received was seen as superior to what men had experienced previously (burden, opportunity costs). The time afforded by the regularly scheduled video-consultations allowed men to come to terms with the recovery process in their own time (self-efficacy), and provided an ongoing sense of support and access to care outside the consultation (ethicality). Clinically, the program improved care co-ordination, expedited identification of survivorship care needs, and met service priorities of providing quality care close to home (burden, perceived effectiveness).

The 5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled PSA aptamer was adsorbed on PCN-223 by π-π stacking and hydrogen-bonding interactions, which contributed to fluorescence quenching because of the photoinduced electron transfer from TAMRA to PCN-223. In addition, the amount of quenched fluorescence of the PSA-binding aptamer complex-PCN-223 was lower than that of TAMRA aptamer-PCN-223 without PSA (at excitation/emission peaks of 545/582 nm), which can be explained by the fact that the PSA-binding aptamer complexes contributed to the separation of the aptamer from PCN-223. ∆F value of fluorescence intensities for TAMRA aptamer-PCN-223 with and without PSA showed a good linear relationship with PSA concentration over a range of 0.1 to 24 ng mL-1, with a detection limit of 0.05 ng mL-1. Compared with three metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) of UiO-66-NH2, ZIF-67, and Ni3(HITP)2 as quenchers, PCN-223 as a Zr-MOF exhibited the highest ∆F value for PSA detection. The advantage of PCN-223 could be attributed to its carboxyl, benzene, and porphyrin groups, the large specific surface area and good biocompatibility. This proposed aptasensor can be successfully used to detect PSA in sera of prostate cancer patients.

There has been some experimental evidence that the biological efficiency of protons is significantly higher for boron-11-containing prostate or breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensitizing potential of sodium borocaptate (BSH) under proton irradiation at the Bragg peak of cultured glioma cells. To address this problem, cells of two glioma lines were preincubated with 80 or 160 ppm boron-11, irradiated both at the middle of 200 MeV beam Spread-Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) and at the distal end of the 89.7 MeV beam SOBP and assessed for the viability, as well as their ability to form colonies. Our results clearly show that BSH provides for only a slight, if any, enhancement of the effect of proton radiation on the glioma cells in vitro. In addition, we repeated the experiments using the Du145 prostate cancer cell line, for which an increase in the biological efficiency of proton irradiation in the presence of sodium borocaptate was demonstrated previously.

Methods:   We defined a cohort of individuals aged ≥35 years who had newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink between 1 January 1998 and 30 November 2018. We assessed trends in all-cause, all-cancer and cancer-specific mortality rates by age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, obesity and smoking status. We used Poisson regression to calculate age- and calendar year-specific mortality rates and Joinpoint regression to assess trends for each outcome. We estimated standardised mortality ratios comparing mortality rates in people with type 2 diabetes with those in the general population.  Results:   Among 137,804 individuals, during a median follow-up of 8.4 years, all-cause mortality rates decreased at all ages between 1998 and 2018; cancer mortality rates also decreased for 55- and 65-year-olds but increased for 75- and 85-year-olds, with average annual percentage changes (AAPCs) of -1.4% (95% CI -1.5, -1.3), -0.2% (-0.3, -0.1), 1.2% (0.8, 1.6) and 1.6% (1.5, 1.7), respectively. Higher AAPCs were observed in women than men (1.5% vs 0.5%), in the least deprived than the most deprived (1.5% vs 1.0%) and in people with morbid obesity than those with normal body weight (5.8% vs 0.7%), although all these stratified subgroups showed upward trends in cancer mortality rates. Increasing cancer mortality rates were also observed in people of White ethnicity and former/current smokers, but downward trends were observed in other ethnic groups and non-smokers. These results have led to persistent inequalities by gender and deprivation but widening disparities by smoking status. Constant upward trends in mortality rates were also observed for pancreatic, liver and lung cancer at all ages, colorectal cancer at most ages, breast cancer at younger ages, and prostate and endometrial cancer at older ages. Compared with the general population, people with type 2 diabetes had a more than 1.5-fold increased risk of colorectal, pancreatic, liver and endometrial cancer mortality during the whole study period.  Conclusions/interpretation:   In contrast to the declines in all-cause mortality rates at all ages, the cancer burden has increased in older people with type 2 diabetes, especially for colorectal, pancreatic, liver and endometrial cancer.

Methods:   A heterogeneous database of 243 T2-weighted prostate studies from 7 countries and 10 machines of 3 different vendors, with the CZ-TZ, PZ, and SV regions manually delineated by two experienced radiologists (ground truth), was used to train (n = 123) and test (n = 120) a U-Net-based model with deep supervision using a cyclical learning rate. The performance of the model was evaluated by means of dice similarity coefficient (DSC), among others. Segmentation results with a DSC above 0.7 were considered accurate.  Results:   The proposed method obtained a DSC of 0.88 ± 0.01, 0.85 ± 0.02, 0.72 ± 0.02, and 0.72 ± 0.02 for the prostate gland, CZ-TZ, PZ, and SV respectively in the 120 studies of the test set when comparing the predicted segmentations with the ground truth. No statistically significant differences were found in the results obtained between manufacturers or continents.  Conclusion:   Prostate multi-regional T2-weighted MR images automatic segmentation can be accurately achieved by U-Net like CNN, generalizable in a highly variable clinical environment with different equipment, acquisition configurations, and population.  Key points:   • Deep learning techniques allows the accurate segmentation of the prostate in three different regions on MR T2w images. • Multi-centric database proved the generalization of the CNN model on different institutions across different continents. • CNN models can be used to aid on the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with prostate cancer.""","""['Ana Jimenez-Pastor', 'Rafael Lopez-Gonzalez', 'Belén Fos-Guarinos', 'Fabio Garcia-Castro', 'Mark Wittenberg', 'Asunción Torregrosa-Andrés', 'Luis Marti-Bonmati', 'Margarita Garcia-Fontes', 'Pablo Duarte', 'Juan Pablo Gambini', 'Leonardo Kayat Bittencourt', 'Felipe Campos Kitamura', 'Vasantha Kumar Venugopal', 'Vidur Mahajan', 'Pablo Ros', 'Emilio Soria-Olivas', 'Angel Alberich-Bayarri']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Automated segmentation of prostate zonal anatomy on T2-weighted (T2W) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map MR images using U-Nets.', 'Fully automatic segmentation on prostate MR images based on cascaded fully convolution network.', 'Fully automated segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in diffusion-weighted MRI using convolutional neural networks.', 'Segmentation of prostate zones using probabilistic atlas-based method with diffusion-weighted MR images.', 'Segmentation of the Prostate Transition Zone and Peripheral Zone on MR Images with Deep Learning.']"""

We described surgical outcomes of 112 consecutive patients who underwent RARP ± extended pelvic lymph-node dissection (ePLND) at OLV Hospital (Aalst, Belgium) between February and November 2022. The median age was 65 yr (interquartile range [IQR] 60-70) and median preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 7.9 ng/ml (5.8-10.7). Thirty-eight patients (34%) had International Society of Urological Pathology grade group ≥3 tumor on prostate biopsy. On preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, 26 (23%) patients had a suspicion of extraprostatic disease. The median operative time was 180 min (IQR 145-200) and 27 men (24%) underwent ePLND. On final pathology, 34 patients (31%) had extraprostatic disease and ten (9%) had positive surgical margins. The median number of nodes removed was 15 (IQR 9-19). Among men with data available on the first PSA after surgery, 88% (60/68) had undetectable PSA (<0.1 ng/ml). The probability of urinary continence (UC) recovery was 36% (95% confidence interval [CI] 28-47%) at 1 mo and 81% (95% CI 72-89%) at 3 mo. The median time to UC recovery was 36 d (95% CI 34-44). This is the first report of data on UC recovery and surgical pathology for patients undergoing RARP for prostate cancer performed with the Hugo RAS robotic system. Future investigations with longer follow-up are awaited.

Unfortunately, prostate cancer cells (PCa) are partially resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis limiting its therapeutic potential. The existing body of knowledge suggests that naturally produced compounds, such as mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), might potentially sensitize cells to TRAIL treatment and improve the efficiency of therapy. Previously, we observed that DON induces oxidative stress and apoptosis in PCa cell lines. Thus we addressed here whether DON can sensitize PCa cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrates that three out of four tested PCa cell lines pretreated with DON increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis detected with flow cytometry. This effect was associated with oxidative stress (LNCaP and DU-145 cell line) and elevated DNA damage (DU-145, LNCaP, and 22Rv1 cell lines). Next, in the animal model we inoculated PC tumor to SCKID mice followed by administration of DON intraperitoneally and/or TRIAL intravenously. During 21 days monitoring of tumor growth, the animals received 7 doses of DON, TRAIL, DON+TRAIL or control injections. No significant reduction in tumor mass was observed after combinational treatment of TRAIL and DON compared to 1 μg/kg of body weight DON treatment alone, which itself decreased the tumor growth. However, despite the lack of the TRAIL + DON effect, DON itself inducing apoptosis is an interesting compound worth investigating in the context of other combination therapies.""","""['Dominika Ewa Habrowska-Górczyńska', 'Karolina Kowalska', 'Kinga Anna Urbanek', 'Kamila Domińska', 'Marta Justyna Kozieł', 'Agnieszka Wanda Piastowska-Ciesielska']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Toxicol Appl Pharmacol""","""['Downmodulation of dimethyl transferase activity enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Curcumin (diferuloyl-methane) enhances tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-induced apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Targeted radiotherapy potentiates the cytotoxicity of a novel anti-human DR5 monoclonal antibody and the adenovirus encoding soluble TRAIL in prostate cancer.', 'eNOS protects prostate cancer cells from TRAIL-induced apoptosis.', 'APO2 ligand/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in prostate cancer therapy.']"""

This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of pNaktide in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced behavioral damage, neuroinflammation, and neuronal damage. We found that pNaktide improved anxiety, memory, and motor deficits. pNaktide inhibited MAPK and NF-κB pathways induced by TLR4 activation, inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome complex, and reduced the expression of inflammatory factors, complement factors, and chemokines. pNaktide inhibited the activation of Nrf2 and HO-1 antioxidant stress pathways by LPS and reduced the level of oxidative stress. Inhibition of autophagy and enhancement of apoptosis induced by LPS were also alleviated by pNaktide, which restored LPS-induced injury to newborn neurons in the hippocampus region.

Patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are often candidates for multiple first-line systemic therapies with similar impacts on life expectancy. However, little is known about the gross and out-of-pocket (OOP) payments associated with each of these drugs for patients with employer-sponsored health insurance. We therefore aimed to determine the gross and OOP payments of first-line drugs for mCRPC and how the payments vary across drugs.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study included 4,298 patients with prostate cancer who initiated therapy with one of six drugs approved for first-line treatment of mCRPC between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2019. We compared gross and OOP payments during the 6 months after initiation of treatment for mCRPC using private payer claims data across patients using different first-line drugs.  Results:   Gross payments varied across drugs. Over the 6 months after the index prescription, mean unadjusted gross drug payments were highest for patients receiving sipuleucel-T ($115,525 USD) and lowest for patients using docetaxel ($12,804 USD). OOP payments were lower than gross drug payments; mean 6-month OOP payments were highest for cabazitaxel ($1,044 USD) and lowest for docetaxel ($296 USD). There was a wide distribution of OOP payments within drug types.  Conclusion:   Drugs for mCRPC are expensive with large differences in payments by drug type. OOP payments among patients with employer-sponsored health insurance are much lower than gross drug payments, and they vary both across and within first-line drug types, with some patients making very high OOP payments. Although lowering drug prices would reduce pharmaceutical spending for patients with mCRPC, decreasing patient financial burden requires understanding an individual patient's benefit design.""","""['Deborah R Kaye', 'Hui-Jie Lee', 'Alexander Gordee', 'Daniel J George', 'Peter A Ubel', 'Charles D Scales', 'M Kate Bundorf']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""['Budgetary Impact of Cabazitaxel Use After Docetaxel Treatment for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Treatment-Related Healthcare Costs of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer in Germany: A Claims Data Study.', 'The association of financial difficulties and out-of-pocket payments with health-related quality of life among breast, prostate and colorectal cancer patients.', 'Patient out-of-pocket spending in cranial neurosurgery: single-institution analysis of 6569 consecutive cases and literature review.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

Methods:   Retrospectively acquired data from patients that underwent 2D LRP (n = 75) and 3DHD LRP (n = 75) from March 2013 to October 2015 were evaluated. Procedures were performed by a single surgeon. The extra-peritoneal approach with 5 trocars was utilized. Perioperative outcomes, potency, and continence were compared between groups.  Results:   Patient characteristics were similar between the two groups in terms of age (p = 0.44), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (p = 0.34), and Gleason scores (p = 0.14). Body mass index (BMI) was significantly higher in the 3DHD group (p = 0.0036). Postoperatively, no significant differences were observed in Hgb loss (p = 0.50), positive surgical margins (p = 1.00), and post-op Gleason scores (p = 0.30). Significant differences were observed for length of hospital stay (p < 0.001) and Jackson-Pratt (JP) drainage (p < 0.001). Regarding potency, 73.7% and 51.6% of the patients in the 3DHD and 2D groups regained potency at 6 months, respectively (p = 0.0025). Almost 43% of the patients in the 3DHD group regained continence at 1 month while for the 2D groups it was only 17.3% (p = 0.0008).  Conclusion:   3DHD and 2D LRP have resulted in good outcomes in the perioperative periods. Our results show decreased JP drainage, shorter length of hospital stay, earlier return of urinary control, and earlier return of sexual function in the 3DHD LRP group.

However, existing prediction models have been developed in select cohorts and have not considered genetic factors.  Methods:   We developed endometrial cancer risk prediction models using data on postmenopausal White women aged 45-85 years from 19 case-control studies in the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium (E2C2). Relative risk estimates for predictors were combined with age-specific endometrial cancer incidence rates and estimates for the underlying risk factor distribution. We externally validated the models in 3 cohorts: Nurses' Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.  Results:   Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the epidemiologic model ranged from 0.64 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.62 to 0.67) to 0.69 (95% CI = 0.66 to 0.72). Improvements in discrimination from the addition of genetic factors were modest (no change in area under the receiver operating characteristic curves in NHS; PLCO = 0.64 to 0.66). The epidemiologic model was well calibrated in NHS II (overall expected-to-observed ratio [E/O] = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.98 to 1.22) and PLCO (overall E/O = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.95 to 1.13) but poorly calibrated in NHS (overall E/O = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.51 to 0.59).  Conclusions:   Using data from the largest, most heterogeneous study population to date (to our knowledge), prediction models based on epidemiologic factors alone successfully identified women at high risk of endometrial cancer.

However, it does not detect changes in molecular regulation. In contrast to the standard differential expression analysis, differential co-expression one aims to detect pairs or clusters whose mutual expression changes between two conditions.  Results:   We developed Differential Co-expression Network Analysis (DCoNA)-an open-source statistical tool that allows one to identify pair interactions, which correlation significantly changes between two conditions. Comparing DCoNA with the state-of-the-art analog, we showed that DCoNA is a faster, more accurate and less memory-consuming tool. We applied DCoNA to prostate mRNA/miRNA-seq data collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and compared predicted regulatory interactions of miRNA isoforms (isomiRs) and their target mRNAs between normal and cancer samples. As a result, almost all highly expressed isomiRs lost negative correlation with their targets in prostate cancer samples compared to ones without the pathology. One exception to this trend was the canonical isomiR of hsa-miR-93-5p acquiring cancer-specific targets. Further analysis showed that cancer aggressiveness simultaneously increased with the expression level of this isomiR in both TCGA primary tumor samples and 153 blood plasma samples of P.

However, a consistent perspective has not been established in digestive system cancer (DSC). To explore the prognostic value of CCAT1 in patients with DSC, a meta-analysis was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biological Medical Literature database, Cochrane Library and WanFang database was applied to select eligible articles. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) or hazard ratios (HRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to estimate the effects of CCAT1 on pathological or clinical features. A total of 1,719 patients from 12 eligible articles were enrolled in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that elevated CCAT1 expression was significantly related to larger tumor size (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.31-2.48), poorer differentiation (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.31-0.64), earlier lymph node metastasis (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 2.34-4.22) and advanced TNM stage (OR, 3.08; 95% CI, 2.07-4.59). In addition, high CCAT1 expression predicted a poorer outcome for overall survival rate (HR, 2.37; 95% CI, 2.11-2.67) and recurrence-free survival rate (HR, 2.16, 95% CI, 1.31-3.57). High expression levels of CCAT1 were therefore related to unfavorable clinical outcomes of patients with DSC.

Hundreds of original articles and reviews on penile cancer are published each year. However, a bibliometric analysis of these publications has not been performed.  Objective:   This study aimed to systematically analyze and visualize penile cancer-related publications through bibliometrics and reveal identified topics, hotspots, and knowledge gaps in related fields.  Methods:   Based on the Web of Science core collection database, we first analyzed the quantity and quality of publications in the field of penile cancer. Second, we profiled the publishing groups in terms of country, institution, author's publication, and cooperation network. Then, we systematized and summarized the hot topics of research.  Results:   This bibliometric analysis was conducted from 2001 to 2022. The analysis identified 1,687 articles and reviews, which were published in 432 journals. The number of publications and citations on penile cancer-related research has steadily increased over the last two decades. Furthermore, academic institutions in Europe and the United States play a leading role in penile cancer research. The country, institution, journal, and author with the most publications were the United States (507), H Lee Moffitt Cancer Research Center (96), Journal of Urology (83), and Spiess P (87), respectively. The most frequently used keywords were penile cancer (743), squamous-cell carcinoma (717), cancer (380), carcinoma (232), lymphadenectomy (229). 16 keyword clustering information was obtained, including #0 male circumcision, #1 lichen sclerosus, #2 chemotherapy, #3 penile neoplasms, #4 targeted therapy, #5 resection margin, #6 cervical cancer, #7 lymph node dissection, #8 prognostic factor, #9 prostate cancer, #10 inguinal lymph node dissection, #11 human papillomavirus DNA, #12 gene, #13 penile intraepithelial neoplasia, #14 male sexual function, and #15 penile cancer.

Materials and methods:   We performed intraprostatic injection of 96% ethanol using a needle which has a segment of its wall made of capillary membrane with hundreds of pores in an acute and chronic canine experiment, in heart-beating cadaveric organ donors, and in a xenograft model of human prostate cancer. Whole mount tissue sections were used for three-dimensional reconstruction of the necrotic lesions and calculation of their volumes.  Results:   The ethanol injection resulted in oval shaped lesions of well-delineated coagulative necrosis. In both healthy human and canine prostates, the prostatic pseudocapsule and neurovascular bundle remained intact without evidence of disruption. There was a linear correlation between administered volume of ethanol and the volume of necrotic lesion. Regression analysis showed strong correlation in the acute canine experiments and in experiments performed on xenografts of human prostate cancer. A formula was calculated for each experiment to estimate the relationship between the injected volume and the volume of infiltrated prostate tissue area.  Conclusions:   Intraprostatic injection using a porous needle allows for effective and predictable tissue distribution of the injectate in the prostate.

TUNEL detected the apoptosis rate of prostate cancer cell DU145 and PC-3 after silencing Hsp27 and ATL-1 treated. qRT-PCR was used to detect the changes of apoptosis related genes caspase-3, PARP, Bax and Bcl-2 in prostate cancer cell DU145 and PC-3 after the effect of silencing Hsp27 and ATL-1 treated. At the same time, the antitumor effect of ATL-1 combined with cabozantinib was analyzed.  Results:   Hsp27 was highly expressed in human prostate cancer. MTT assay showed that ATL-1 inhibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC-3 compared with the control group. TUNEL results showed that silencing Hsp27 and ATL-1 treated could significantly promote the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells DU145 and PC-3 compared with the control group. qRT-PCR results showed that compared with the control group, ATL-1 could promote the expression of caspase-3, PARP and Bax in DU145 and PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Inhibition of Hsp27 by ATL-1 reduced cell viability and induced apoptosis. ATL-1 inhibits the antitumor effect of Hsp27 - enhanced cabozantinib. Hsp27 regulates eIF4E and mediates cell protection.

Methods:   Single cell data of 4 normal samples, 3 CRPC samples and 3 CRPC-NE samples were obtained from GEO database, and CellChatDB was used for potential intercellular communication, Secondly, using the ""limma"" package (v3.52.0), we obtained the differential expressed genes between CRPC and CRPC-NE both in single-cell RNA seq and bulk RNA seq samples, and discovered 12 differential genes characterized by CRPC-NE. Then, on the one hand, the diagnosis model of CRPC-NE is developed by random forest algorithm and artificial neural network (ANN) through Cbioportal database; On the other hand, using the data in Cbioportal and GEO database, the DFS and PFS prognostic model of PCa was established and verified through univariate Cox analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression and multivariate Cox regression in R software. Finally, somatic mutation and immune infiltration were also discussed.  Results:   Our research shows that there exists specific intercellular communication in classified clusters. Secondly, a CRPC-NE diagnostic model of six genes (HMGN2, MLLT11, SOX4, PCSK1N, RGS16 and PTMA) has been established and verified, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is as high as 0.952 (95% CI: 0.882-0.994). The mutation landscape shows that these six genes are rarely mutated in the CRPC and NEPC samples. In addition, NE-DFS signature (STMN1 and PCSK1N) and NE-PFS signature (STMN1, UBE2S and HMGN2) are good predictors of DFS and PFS in PCa patients and better than other clinical features. Lastly, the infiltration levels of plasma cells, T cells CD4 naive, Eosinophils and Monocytes were significantly different between the CRPC and NEPC groups.

This study reports a simple and rapid circRNA enrichment and isolation technique named ""HAZIS-CirR"" for the analysis of urinary circRNAs. The method utilizes homobifunctional hydrazides with amine-modified zeolite and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) syringe filtration for combining electrostatic and covalent coupling and size-based filtration, and it offers instrument-free isolation of circRNAs in 20 min without volume limitation, thermoregulation, and lysis. HAZIS-CirR has high capture efficiency (82.03%-92.38%) and a 10-fold more sensitive detection limit (20 fM) than before enrichment (200 fM). The clinical utility of HAZIS-CirR is confirmed by analyzing circulating mRNAs and circulating miRNAs in 89 urine samples. Furthermore, three miRNA panels that differentiate PCa from BPH and control, PCa from control, and BPH from control, respectively, are established by comparing miRNA levels.

Bone is continuously mechanically loaded, which likely modulates the paracrine signaling from osteocytes towards PC cells to affect tumor behavior. We hypothesize that shear loaded osteocytes affect PC cell proliferation, invasion and epithelial and mesenchymal-related gene and protein expression. We cultured human DU145 cells, a commonly used cell line for prostate cancer metastases, in the conditioned medium (CM) from shear loaded or unloaded human osteocyte-like-cells (OCYLCs) for 1 and 3 days and assessed their number by staining nuclei with DAPI, their invasion by performing an invasion assay, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT)-related gene and protein expression by qPCR and immunocytochemistry. CM of shear loaded OCYLCs did not affect DU145 cell number compared to CM of static cultured OCYLCs, but decreased their invasion 1.34-fold. CM of shear loaded OCYLCs enhanced expression of epithelial genes: SYND1 and CDH1 after day 1, while it also enhanced CDH1 after day 3. CM of shear loaded osteocytes enhanced mesenchymal genes: VMN, Snail and MIP2 after day 1, while it decreased expression of mesenchymal CYR61 after day 3. We conclude that CM of shear loaded OCYLCs does not affect DU145 cell proliferation, but decreases their invasion, and differentially affects their EMT-related gene expression.

Preclinical studies have reported that niclosamide at clinically relevant concentrations inhibits androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7), a known tumor driver in CRPC. However, the magnitude of anti-tumor effects of niclosamide either used alone or in combination with abiraterone in these experimental models, far exceeded what could have been explained as a simple AR-V7 inhibition. Niclosamide at clinically relevant concentrations also acts as an oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) uncoupler in mitochondria. This raises the question whether the observed effects of niclosamide were partly mediated by OxPhos inhibition. Most OxPhos inhibitors did not demonstrate selectivity towards cancer cells and failed to enter clinical practice due to unacceptable toxicity. However, some mitochondrial uncouplers have greater cytotoxicity against cancerous cells compared to non-cancerous. Hyperpolarization of cancer cell mitochondria, or the more alkaline mitochondrial matrix of cancer cells could be potential reasons for this. Niclosamide can also alter Wnt/β-catenin, mTOR, Notch, NF-kB and STAT3 signaling pathways. Hence, the mechanism of action of reformulated niclosamide in CRPC patients requires further investigation.

Materials and Methods This prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03440554) included 139 men with prostate cancer (mean age, 70 years ± 9 [SD]). Multicompartmental models with two to four tissue compartments were fit to DWI data from whole-body scans to determine optimal compartmental diffusion coefficients. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and model-fitting residuals were calculated to quantify model complexity and goodness of fit. Diffusion coefficients for the optimal model (having lowest BIC) were used to compute compartmental signal-contribution maps. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) of bone lesions to normal-appearing bone was measured on these signal-contribution maps and on conventional DWI scans and compared using paired t tests (α = .05). Two-sample t tests (α = .05) were used to compare compartmental signal fractions between lesions and normal-appearing bone. Results Lowest BIC was observed from the four-compartment model, with optimal compartmental diffusion coefficients of 0, 1.1 × 10-3, 2.8 × 10-3, and >3.0 ×10-2 mm2/sec. Fitting residuals from this model were significantly lower than from conventional apparent diffusion coefficient mapping (P < .001). Bone lesion SIR was significantly higher on signal-contribution maps of model compartments 1 and 2 than on conventional DWI scans (P < .008). The fraction of signal from compartments 2, 3, and 4 was also significantly different between metastatic bone lesions and normal-appearing bone tissue (P ≤ .02). Conclusion The four-compartment model best described whole-body diffusion properties. Compartmental signal contributions from this model can be used to examine prostate cancer bone involvement.

Ploussard and Mazzone have integrated these tools into novel risk classification systems predicting the risk of early biochemical recurrence (eBCR) in PCa patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP). We aimed to assess available risk classification systems and to define the best-performing.  Methods:   Data on 1371 patients diagnosed by MRI-targeted biopsy and treated by RP between 2014 and 2022 at eight European tertiary referral centers were analyzed. Risk classifications systems included were the European Association of Urology (EAU) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk groups, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score, the International Staging Collaboration for Cancer of the Prostate (STAR-CAP) classification, the Ploussard and Mazzone models, and ISUP grade group. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to compare eBCR among risk classification systems. Performance was assessed in terms of discrimination quantified using Harrell's c-index, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   Overall, 152 (11%) patients had eBCR at a median follow-up of 31 months (interquartile range: 19-45). The 3-year eBCR-free survival rate was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 89-93). For each risk classification system, a significant difference among survival probabilities was observed (log-rank test p < 0.05) except for NCCN classification (p = 0.06). The highest discrimination was obtained with the STAR-CAP classification (c-index 66%) compared to CAPRA score (63% vs. 66%, p = 0.2), ISUP grade group (62% vs. 66, p = 0.07), Ploussard (61% vs. 66%, p = 0.003) and Mazzone models (59% vs. 66%, p = 0.02), and EAU (57% vs. 66%, p < 0.001) and NCCN (57% vs. 66%, p < 0.001) risk groups. Risk classification systems demonstrated good calibration characteristics. At DCA, the CAPRA score showed the highest net benefit at a probability threshold of 9%-15%.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) among users of pegfilgrastim biosimilars (pegfilgrastim-jmdb and pegfilgrastim-cbqv) and the originator product. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using 2019 IBM MarketScan databases to assess comparative effectiveness of pegfilgrastim originator and biosimilars for prevention of FN among patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Patients with cancer, including breast, lung, colorectal, esophageal and gastric, pancreatic, prostate, ovarian, and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, initiating myelosuppressive chemotherapy courses were selected. We further selected patients who used pegfilgrastim originator and biosimilars within 3 days of chemotherapy completion. FN-associated hospitalizations were measured by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes. After 1:1 propensity score matching, we used equivalence (with a margin of 6%) hypothesis tests to compare FN-related hospitalization risk in the first cycle and across all cycles between biosimilars and originator users. RESULTS: A total of 2,045 patients were included, of which 445 (21.8%) used pegfilgrastim-jmdb, 636 (31.1%) used pegfilgrastim-cbqv, and 964 (47.1%) used pegfilgrastim originator. After matching, 13 out of 445 originator users and 17 out of 445 pegfilgrastim-jmdb users developed FN after the first chemotherapy cycle (risk difference was 0.9%; P < 0.001 for equivalence test indicating statistical equivalence). After matching, 14 out of 633 originator users and 16 out of 633 pegfilgrastim-cbqv users developed FN (risk difference was 0.32%; P < 0.001 for equivalence test indicating statistical equivalence). Results across all cycles (including the first cycle) were consistent with that in the first cycle. CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world study of patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there was no difference in FN risk between patients receiving pegfilgrastim originator and biosimilars in the first cycle and across all cycles. These results add further to the current evidence on pegfilgrastim biosimilars and support wider adoption of pegfilgrastim biosimilars among payers, providers, and patients.

Logistic regression including age, tPSA and %f/tPSA was used to model the probability of having high or low grade cancer by defining 3 outcome levels: no PCa, low grade (International Society of Urological Pathology grade, ISUP<3) and high grade PCa (ISUP≥3).  Results:   The nomogram identifying patients with: (a) high vs. those with low grade PCa and without the disease showed a good discriminating capability (∼80%), but the calibration showed a risk of underestimation for predictive probabilities >30% (a considerable critical threshold of risk), (b) ISUP<3 vs. those without the disease showed a discriminating capability of 63% and overestimates predictive probabilities >50%. In ISUP 5 a possible loss of PSA immunoreactivity has been observed.  Conclusions:   The estimated risk of high or low grade PCa by the nomograms may be of aid in the decision-making process, in particular in the case of critical comorbidities and when the digital rectal examinations are inconclusive. The improved characterization of the risk of ISUP≥3 might enhance the use for magnetic resonance imaging in this setting.""","""['Simona Ferraro', 'Davide Biganzoli', 'Roberta Simona Rossi', 'Franco Palmisano', 'Marco Bussetti', 'Enrica Verzotti', 'Andrea Gregori', 'Filippo Bianchi', 'Marco Maggioni', 'Ferruccio Ceriotti', 'Cristina Cereda', 'Gianvincenzo Zuccotti', 'Peter Kavsak', 'Mario Plebani', 'Giuseppe Marano', 'Elia Mario Biganzoli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Chem Lab Med""","""['Association of Gleason score with PSA Values and Serum Testosterone Levels Measured Prior To Prostate Biopsy.', 'A novel nomogram to identify candidates for active surveillance amongst patients with International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade Group (GG) 1 or ISUP GG2 prostate cancer, according to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging findings.', 'Human glandular kallikrein as a tool to improve discrimination of poorly differentiated and non-organ-confined prostate cancer compared with prostate-specific antigen.', 'Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) isoform p2PSA significantly improves the prediction of prostate cancer at initial extended prostate biopsies in patients with total PSA between 2.0 and 10 ng/ml: results of a prospective study in a clinical setting.', 'Screening for prostate cancer in 2008 II: the importance of molecular subforms of prostate-specific antigen and tissue kallikreins.', 'Targeting P21-Activated Kinase-1 for Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

Defects in this system can lead to genomic instability that can affect tissue homeostasis and thus compromise human health. Variations in ploidy and cell heterogeneity are observed frequently in human cancers. Here, we examine the consequences of upregulating the cell cycle regulator Cyclin E in the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland. The accessory gland is the functional analog of the human prostate. This organ is composed of a postmitotic epithelium that is emerging as a powerful in vivo system for modelling different aspects of tumor initiation and progression. We show that Cyclin E upregulation in this model is sufficient to drive tissue dysplasia. Cyclin E overexpression drives endoreplication and affects DNA integrity, which results in heterogeneous nuclear and cellular composition and variable degrees of DNA damage. We present evidence showing that, despite the presence of genotoxic stress, those cells are resistant to apoptosis and thus defective cells are not eliminated from the tissue. We also show that Cyclin E-expressing cells in the accessory gland display mitochondrial DNA aggregates that colocalize with Cyclin E protein. Together, the findings presented here show that Cyclin E upregulation in postmitotic cells of the accessory gland organ causes cellular defects such as genomic instability and mitochondrial defects, eventually leading to tissue dysplasia. This study highlights novel mechanisms by which Cyclin E might contribute to disease initiation and progression.""","""['Maria Molano-Fernández', 'Ian D Hickson', 'Héctor Herranz']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Cell Dev Biol""","""['Polyploid mitosis and depolyploidization promote chromosomal instability and tumor progression in a Notch-induced tumor model.', 'miR-285-Yki/Mask double-negative feedback loop mediates blood-brain barrier integrity in Drosophila.', 'Expression of an S phase-stabilized version of the CDK inhibitor Dacapo can alter endoreplication.', 'Cyclin E/CDK2: DNA Replication, Replication Stress and Genomic Instability.', 'Cyclin E Deregulation and Genomic Instability.', 'Editorial: Regulation and coordination of the different DNA damage responses and their role in tissue homeostasis maintenance.']"""

As the proportion of Australians categorised overweight or obese approaches 70%, it is not well understood how this growth will impact RT departments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the current and potential future body mass index (BMI) of RT patients at one centre, with the purpose of identifying variables that may impact resource planning decisions.  Methods:   De-identified demographic data including gender, age, diagnosis code, activity code and BMI were obtained from MOSAIQ® oncology information system for 5548 courses of RT commenced between 2017 and 2020, and retrospectively analysed. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. Simple and multiple linear regression was used to analyse for statistically significant relationships between variables.  Results:   Of all patient courses, 64% were overweight or obese. Average BMI increased over time by 0.3 kg/m2 per year. Courses related to the young and elderly had a lower average BMI. Breast, brain/skull, and pelvis/prostate treatment sites had a significant association with a higher average BMI. Thorax treatment sites had a lower average BMI, but this average is increasing at the fastest rate of all treatment sites. Prone breast courses had an average BMI 5.58 kg/m2 higher than IMRT/VMAT courses.  Conclusion:   Results demonstrate that patient BMI is increasing. Resources related to breast courses (breast board, prone board) and thorax courses (lung board) may experience increased strain in the future.

Magnetically actuated microrobots represent the most promising technology in modern nanomedicine, offering the advantage of wireless guidance, effective cell penetration, and non-invasive actuation. Here, new biodegradable magnetically actuated zinc/cystine-based microrobots for in situ treatment of prostate cancer cells are reported. The microrobots are fabricated via metal-ion-mediated self-assembly of the amino acid cystine encapsulating superparamagnetic Fe3 O4 nanoparticles (NPs) during the synthesis, which allows their precise manipulation by a rotating magnetic field. Inside the cells, the typical enzymatic reducing environment favors the disassembly of the aminoacidic chemical structure due to the cleavage of cystine disulfide bonds and disruption of non-covalent interactions with the metal ions, as demonstrated by in vitro experiments with reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). In this way, the cystine microrobots served for site-specific delivery of Zn2+ ions responsible for tumor cell killing via a ""Trojan horse effect"".

Materials and methods:   Thirty-four prostate cancer patients (70 ± 7 years) were assessed shortly after initiation of androgen deprivation therapy and again 5 months thereafter. Measurements consisted of whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (body composition), computed tomography scanning of the upper leg (muscle mass), one-repetition maximum leg press (muscle strength), cardiopulmonary exercise testing (aerobic capacity), blood draws (metabolic parameters), accelerometry (habitual physical activity) and questionnaires (health-related quality-of-life). Data were analyzed with Student's paired t-tests.  Results:   Over time, whole-body fat mass (from 26.2 ± 7.7 to 28.4 ± 8.3 kg, p < 0.001) and fasting insulin (from 9.5 ± 5.8 to 11.3 ± 6.9 mU/L, p < 0.001) increased.

However, the adherence of ADT prescription to current guidelines is not optimal and must be balanced against possible side effects. Aim of this study was to evaluate the prescriptive appropriateness of ADT and ADT-related adverse events in a referral center for PCa.  Methods:   Five hundred fifty six patients who received an outpatient prescription for ADT from 2014 to 2018 were retrospectively identified from an administrative database. Only standard ADT was considered, including GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, and antiandrogens. Prescriptive appropriateness was defined according to the last European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines. Our cohort was stratified according to age categories and patient follow-up was updated.  Results:   Four hundred twenty five patients were available for analysis. Mean age was 80 years; 96.3% of our patients fell in the ""elderly"" category. There was a predominance of GnRH agonists over the antagonists (84.9% vs 13%). 15.5% of ADTs did not have an appropriate indication according to guidelines. Patient compliance to ADT was evaluated as good in 372 (87.5%) cases. ADT-related complications were detected in 166 (39%) patients: bone, cardiovascular, and other complications were reported in 7.3%, 8.9%, and 19% of patients. Progression of disease was noted in 165 (38.8%) cases during ADT. At last follow-up, 124 (30.1%) patients were deceased.  Conclusions:   In a referral center, most ADT prescriptions followed EAU guidelines, but a non-negligible proportion still did not fall within these indications, exposing patients to unnecessary side effects. Compliance to ADT was generally good with a predominant use of GnRH agonists.

This study aims to elucidate the trends in smoking-related prostate cancer from 1990 to 2019 using Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 study data.  Methods:   Data on prostate cancer attributable to smoking were extracted from Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. The numbers and age-standardized rates on smoking-related prostate cancer mortality (ASMR) and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) were analyzed by year, age, region, country, and socio-demographic index (SDI) level. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was calculated to evaluate the temporal trends of ASMR and ASDR from 1990 to 2019.  Results:   Of all prostate cancer deaths and DALYs globally in 2019, 6% and 6.6% were attributable to smoking, which contributed to 29,298 (95% CI 12,789 to 46,609) deaths and 571,590 (95% CI 253,490 to 917,820) disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 2019. The number of smoking-related deaths and DALYs showed an upward trend, increasing by half from 1990 to 2019, while ASMR and ASDR declined in five sociodemographic indexes (SDI) regions, with the fastest decline in high SDI regions. For geographical regions, Western Europe and East Asia were the high-risk areas of prostate cancer deaths and DALYs attributable to smoking, among which China and the United States were the countries with the heaviest burden. The ASMR has decreased in all age groups, with the fastest decrease occurring in 75-79 years old. The ASMR or ASDR tended to increase in countries with the lowest SDI, but declined in countries with the highest SDI. The EAPC in ASMR or ASDR was highly negatively correlated with Human Development Index (HDI) in 2019, with coefficients 0.46.  Conclusion:   The number of smoking-related prostate cancer deaths and DALYs continued to increase globally, whereas its ASMR and ASDR have been decreasing. This substantial progress is particularly significant in developed regions and vary across geographic regions.

Methods:   In total, 582 mCRPC patients undergoing first-line abiraterone therapy from four institutions were sorted by three phases. In the discovery phase, 30 plasma samples from 30 case-matched patients with or without early progression were obtained to generate circRNA expression profiles using RNA sequencing. In the training phase, differentially expressed circRNAs were examined using digital droplet PCR in a training cohort (n = 203). The circRNA signature was constructed using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator Cox regression to predict OS. In the validation phase, the prognostic ability of this signature was prospectively validated in two external cohorts (Cohort I, n = 183; Cohort II, n = 166).  Results:   We developed a five-circRNA signature, based on circCEP112, circFAM13A, circBRWD1, circVPS13C and circMACROD2, which successfully stratified patients into high-risk and low-risk groups.

This standard treatment scheme has proved safe and effective resulting in objective response in most patients with no significant toxicity. Many patients, however, show high-volume residual tumor burden after the sixth cycle and may benefit from treatment continuation. Extended treatment with additional cycles has been withheld due to concerns on potential increased toxicity.  Methods:   Twenty-six patients with high-volume residual tumor burden (according to CHAARTED) after standard RLT with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and no alternative treatment option received additional RLT cycles reaching a median of 10 (range 7-16) cycles with a mean activity of 7.4 ± 0.9 GBq per cycle. Response assessment with [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was done every 2-3 cycles or if disease progression was clinically suspected or based on change in PSA value (according to the PCWG3 criteria). Toxicity was measured using routine blood work up including blood counts, liver and renal function, and was graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria. Survival outcome was calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier method.  Results:   Further PSA decline of 33 ± 28% during the extended treatment was observed in 21/26 (81%) patients, whereas 5/26 (19%) patients showed a PSA increase; correspondingly in 11/21 patients with an initial response (PR or SD) to extended cycles, treatment was discontinued due to progressive disease, whereas six (23%) patients achieved low-volume residual disease. Two (8%) patients died without showing progression, and two (8%) patients are still under therapy. The median progression-free survival was 19 (95% CI: 15-23) months, and the overall survival was 29 (95% CI: 18-40) months. Grade ≥ 3 hematological toxicities occurred in 4/26 (15%) patients during treatment extension, and nephrotoxicity (grade ≥ 3) was observed in 1/26 (4%) patient during the follow-up.

Previous research has shown differences in barriers to presentation with cancer between ethnic groups. The completeness and quality of cancer stage and ethnicity data has improved markedly over recent years in England, allowing for comparison of stage distributions at diagnosis between ethnic groups. This study aimed to assess relationships between ethnic group and two outcomes: unknown stage cancer and late stage (stages 3 and 4) cancer, after adjustment for confounders.  Design and setting:   A retrospective secondary data analysis using data from NHS Digital's National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service and Hospital Episode Statistics records from 2012 to 2016.  Participants:   This study analysed newly diagnosed breast, colon, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ovary, prostate and uterine cancers in white British, Caribbean, African, Chinese and Asian patients aged 15-99 in England.  Results:   Caribbean, African and Asian women with breast or ovarian cancer, Caribbean and African women with uterine or colon cancer, Caribbean women with NSCLC and Caribbean men with colon cancer had increased odds of late-stage disease at diagnosis compared with the white British cohort. In contrast, Caribbean and African men with prostate cancer had decreased odds of late-stage cancer. Where stage was known, there were variations in late-stage cancer by ethnic group.

Leveraging a cutting-edge machine learning technique that accommodates a wide list of questionnaire-based predictors, we sought to optimize and validate a lung cancer prediction model.  Methods:   We developed an Optimized early Warning model for Lung cancer risk (OWL) using the XGBoost algorithm with 323,344 participants from the England area in UK Biobank (training set), and independently validated it with 93,227 participants from UKB Scotland and Wales area (validation set 1), as well as 70,605 and 66,231 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO) control and intervention subpopulations, respectively (validation sets 2 & 3) and 23,138 and 18,669 participants in the United States National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) control and intervention subpopulations, respectively (validation sets 4 & 5). By comparing with three competitive prediction models, i.e., PLCO modified 2012 (PLCOm2012), PLCO modified 2014 (PLCOall2014), and the Liverpool Lung cancer Project risk model version 3 (LLPv3), we assessed the discrimination of OWL by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) at the designed time point. We further evaluated the calibration using relative improvement in the ratio of expected to observed lung cancer cases (RIEO), and illustrated the clinical utility by the decision curve analysis.  Findings:   For general population, with validation set 1, OWL (AUC = 0.855, 95% CI: 0.829-0.880) presented a better discriminative capability than PLCOall2014 (AUC = 0.821, 95% CI: 0.794-0.848) (p < 0.001); with validation sets 2 & 3, AUC of OWL was comparable to PLCOall2014 (AUCPLCOall2014-AUCOWL < 1%). For ever-smokers, OWL outperformed PLCOm2012 and PLCOall2014 among ever-smokers in validation set 1 (AUCOWL = 0.842, 95% CI: 0.814-0.871; AUCPLCOm2012 = 0.792, 95% CI: 0.760-0.823; AUCPLCOall2014 = 0.791, 95% CI: 0.760-0.822, all p < 0.001). OWL remained comparable to PLCOm2012 and PLCOall2014 in discrimination (AUC difference from -0.014 to 0.008) among the ever-smokers in validation sets 2 to 5. In all the validation sets, OWL outperformed LLPv3 among the general population and the ever-smokers. Of note, OWL showed significantly better calibration than PLCOm2012, PLCOall2014 (RIEO from 43.1% to 92.3%, all p < 0.001), and LLPv3 (RIEO from 41.4% to 98.7%, all p < 0.001) in most cases. For clinical utility, OWL exhibited significant improvement in average net benefits (NB) over PLCOall2014 in validation set 1 (NB improvement: 32, p < 0.001); among ever smokers of validation set 1, OWL (average NB = 289) retained significant improvement over PLCOm2012 (average NB = 213) (p < 0.001). OWL had equivalent NBs with PLCOm2012 and PLCOall2014 in PLCO and NLST populations, while outperforming LLPv3 in the three populations.

In this project, 1, 2, 4, 5-benzenetetramine (Y15, a focal adhesion kinase inhibitor) derived cationic carbon dots (Y15-CDs) were prepared via a hydrothermal approach utilizing Y15, folic acid and 1,2-ethylenediamine as precursors. Based on the structural, optical, and morphologic characterizations, Y15-CDs possess rich amine groups and nitrogen in structure, an excitation-dependent photoluminescence emission, and a small particle size of 2 to 4 nm. The DNA binding experiments conducted through agarose gel electrophoresis, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence emission, and circular dichroism spectroscopies, prove that Y15-CDs might bind with DNA via electrostatic interactions and partially intercalative binding modes. In addition, the cell imaging and cytotoxicity studies in human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF), prostate cancer (PC3) and osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) indicate the nucleus targeting and anticancer abilities of Y15-CDs.

CT has the potential to enhance radiography practice, but it also has the risk of drastically increasing patient doses. One CT procedure for the abdomen pelvis (AP) area can expose a patient's prostate or uterus to a substantial radiation dose, leading to concerns about radiation-induced cancer. This study aimed to estimate organ doses of the uterus and prostate and evaluate the lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of cancer incidence and mortality resulting from AP CT examinations. This retrospective study included 665 patients, of which 380 (57%) were female, and 285 (43%) were male. Data were collected from the picture archiving and communication system for AP CT procedures and exposure parameter data. Organ doses for the uterus and prostate were calculated using National Cancer Institute CT (NCICT) software. Based on the risk models proposed by the BEIR VII report, the calculated organ doses were used to estimate the LAR of prostate and uterus cancer incidence and mortality due to radiation exposure from AP CT procedures. The mean effective dose resulting from AP CT for females and males was 5.76 ± 3.22 (range: 1.13-12.71 mSv) and 4.37 ± 1.66 mSv (range: 1.36-8.07 mSv), respectively. The mean organ dose to the uterus was 10.86 ± 6.09 mGy (range: 2.13-24.06 mGy). The mean organ dose to the prostate was 7.00 ± 2.66 mGy (range: 2.18-12.94 mGy). The LAR of uterus and prostate cancer incidence was 1.75 ± 1.19 cases and 2.24 ± 1.06 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively. The LAR of cancer mortality rates from uterus and prostate cancers were 0.36 ± 0.22 and 0.48 ± 0.18 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively. The LAR of prostate and uterus cancer occurrence and mortality from radiation doses with AP CT procedures was low but not trivial. Therefore, efforts should be made to lower patient doses while retaining image quality. Although the minimization of the patient's radiation dose must guide clinical practice, the estimated slight increase in risk could aid in easing fears regarding well-justified AP CT procedures.""","""['Nasser Shubayr', 'Yazeed Alashban']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Public Health""","""['The role of Size-Specific Dose Estimate (SSDE) in patient-specific organ dose and cancer risk estimation in paediatric chest and abdominopelvic CT examinations.', 'Lifetime attributable risk of cancer incidence and mortality in routine digital radiology procedures.', 'ESTIMATION OF FEMALE RADIATION DOSES AND BREAST CANCER RISK FROM CHEST CT EXAMINATIONS.', 'Radiation doses and cancer risks from breast imaging studies.', 'Medical exposure to radiation and thyroid cancer.']"""

Results:   The developed DL based algorithm is able to detect MBD on BSs, with high specificity and sensitivity (0.80 and 0.82 respectively on the external test set), in a shorter time compared to the nuclear medicine physicians (2.5 min for AI and 30 min for nuclear medicine physicians to classify 134 BSs).

In the current study, we identified the essential role of serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 2 (SGK2) in promoting prostate cancer metastasis by inhibiting ferroptosis. We found that the expression of SGK2 was higher in metastatic prostate cancer and predicted poor clinical outcomes. SGK2 knockdown inhibited the metastatic capacity of prostate cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, while SGK2 overexpression inhibited ferroptosis and facilitated prostate cancer metastasis by phosphorylating the Thr-24 and Ser-319 sites of forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). This process induced the translocation of FOXO1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, relieving the inhibitory effect of FOXO1 on glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4).

The small-molecule antagonist 5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)chromen-4-one (KCI807) binds to AR, blocking ELK1 binding and inhibiting PCa growth. We investigated the mode of interaction of KCI807 with AR using systematic mutagenesis coupled with ELK1 coactivation assays, testing polypeptide binding and Raman spectroscopy. In full-length AR, deletion of neither ELK1 binding segment affected sensitivity of residual ELK1 coactivation to KCI807. Although the NTD is sufficient for association of AR with ELK1, interaction of the isolated NTD with ELK1 was insensitive to KCI807. In contrast, coactivation of ELK1 by the AR-V7 splice variant, comprising the NTD and the DNA binding domain (DBD), was sensitive to KCI807. Deletions and point mutations within DBD segment 558-595, adjacent to the NTD, interfered with coactivation of ELK1, and residual ELK1 coactivation by the mutants was insensitive to KCI807. In a glutathione S-transferase pull-down assay, KCI807 inhibited ELK1 binding to an AR polypeptide that included the two ELK1 binding segments and the DBD but did not affect ELK1 binding to a similar AR segment that lacked the sequence downstream of residue 566. Raman spectroscopy detected KCI807-induced conformational change in the DBD. The data point to a putative KCI807 binding pocket within the crystal structure of the DBD and indicate that either mutations or binding of KCI807 at this site will induce conformational changes that disrupt ELK1 binding to the NTD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The small-molecule antagonist KCI807 disrupts association of the androgen receptor (AR) with ELK1, serving as a prototype for the development of small molecules for a novel type of therapeutic intervention in drug-resistant prostate cancer. This study provides basic information needed for rational KCI807-based drug design by identifying a putative binding pocket in the DNA binding domain of AR through which KCI807 modulates the amino-terminal domain to inhibit ELK1 binding.""","""['Claire Soave', 'Charles Ducker', 'Naeyma Islam', 'Seongho Kim', 'Sally Yurgelevic', 'Nathan I Nicely', 'Luke Pardy', 'Yanfang Huang', 'Peter E Shaw', 'Gregory Auner', 'Alex Dickson', 'Manohar Ratnam']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Pharmacol""","""['Strategy for Tumor-Selective Disruption of Androgen Receptor Function in the Spectrum of Prostate Cancer.', 'Identification of ELK1 interacting peptide segments in the androgen receptor.', 'The Amino-terminal Domain of the Androgen Receptor Co-opts Extracellular Signal-regulated Kinase (ERK) Docking Sites in ELK1 Protein to Induce Sustained Gene Activation That Supports Prostate Cancer Cell Growth.', 'A sting in the tail: the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor as a drug target.', 'Targeting the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor: The effective approach in therapy of CRPC.']"""

Standardised Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and Standardised Incidence Rates (SIRs) were estimated for the whole cohort and for: production; maintenance and office workers. SMRs and SIRs were calculated by time since first employment.  Results:   Among production workers, there was an excess risk of mortality from mesothelioma (SMR 2.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 5.2), lung (SMR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.8), prostate (SMR 1.9, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.7) and liver cancer (SMR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.4) and the SIR was also increased for overall respiratory cancers, specifically lung cancers. An excess risk of death from stomach cancer (SMR 2.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 6.1) and Alzheimer's disease (SMR 3.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 7.9) was seen among maintenance workers. The overall risk of death was similar to that of the Australian general population, as was mortality from cancers overall and non-malignant respiratory disease.  Conclusions:   No excess risk of death from bladder cancer or non-malignant respiratory disease was found. Excess lung cancer mortality and incidence may be explained by smoking and excess mortality from mesothelioma may be explained by asbestos exposure. An excess risk of mortality from liver and prostate cancer has been shown in production workers and requires further investigation.""","""['Anthony Del Monaco', 'Christina Dimitriadis', 'Sophia Xie', 'Geza Benke', 'Malcolm Ross Sim', 'Karen Walker-Bone']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Occup Environ Med""","""['Mortality and cancer incidence in workers in two Australian prebake aluminium smelters.', 'Update of a prospective study of mortality and cancer incidence in the Australian petroleum industry.', 'All cause mortality and incidence of cancer in workers in bauxite mines and alumina refineries.', 'The association between occupational asbestos exposure with the risk of incidence and mortality from prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Health status of petrochemical workers: a narrative review.']"""

Here, we show that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LHRH) analog-tethered multi-layered polyamidoamine (PAMAM) nanoconstructs silence the anti-apoptotic MCL-1 gene in LHRH receptor overexpressing human breast (MCF-7) and prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells with 70.91 % and 74.10 % efficiency, respectively. These results were confirmed by RT-PCR. The Acridine orange/Ethidium bromide (AO/EB) dual staining revealed that the silencing of MCL-1 induced apoptosis in both the cell lines. In vivo tumor regression studies performed using MCF-7 and LNCaP xenografted severe combined immunodeficiency(SCID) mice demonstrated highly improved tumor regression in groups treated with targeted nanoconstructs complexed with MCL-1 siRNA (T + siMCL-1) compared to the other treatment groups. The quantitative RT-PCR results of tumor tissues demonstrated significant MCL-1 gene silencing, i.e., 73.76 % and 92.63 % in breast and prostate tumors, respectively, after T + siMCL-1 treatment. Reduction in MCL-1 protein expression as assessed by immunohistochemistry further confirmed these results. Furthermore, the caspase 3/7 assay demonstrated apoptosis in the MCL-1 silenced tissues.

Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is a pivotal regulator that maintains homeostasis of mitochondrial function. However, its role in prostate carcinogenesis has not been well elucidated. Materials and Methods: In the present study, we analyzed the expression of TFAM in normal prostate tissue and prostate cancer using public databases; a prostate-tissue chip was used to verify the results. The expression of TFAM in normal cells and in prostate cancer cells was determined by western blotting analysis. We knocked down TFAM in the prostate cancer cell line PC3 using a specific shRNA to explore the potential effects of TFAM in prostatic carcinogenesis. Results: We observed higher expression levels of TFAM in prostate cancer tissue than in normal prostate tissue and tumor adjacent normal tissues. A receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn that demonstrated the diagnostic efficacy of using TFAM expression for prostate cancer prognoses. Elevated levels of TFAM may indicate poorer overall survival in prostate cancer patients. Western blotting assays also showed that relative to the normal prostatic epithelial cell line RWPE-1, prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 expressed more TFAM protein. Furthermore, knockdown of TFAM inhibited the colony-formation capability of PC3 cells. Conclusion: Collectively, these results suggest that TFAM promotes carcinogenesis of the prostate, and may constitute a marker to be used in the diagnosis and prognosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Yaqiong Tian', 'Zhijuan Fan', 'Shuang Liu', 'Yujing Wu', 'Shuye Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Genet Test Mol Biomarkers""","""['Correction to: Identifying Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A As a Potential Biomarker for the Carcinogenesis and Prognosis of Prostate Cancer, by Yaqiong Tian, et al.

We evaluated the diagnostic value of MRI-MicroUS fusion biopsy and determined the additional benefit of employing MicroUS.  Methods:   - Retrospective analysis of consecutive treatment-naïve men undergoing MRI-MicroUS fusion biopsy between May 2018 and March 2019. Pre-biopsy MRI was systematically reviewed in a dedicated meeting where suspicious lesions PIRADS ≥ 3 were registered and uploaded in the ExactVu MicroUS device. MRI and MicroUS lesions were individually marked in a PIRADS v2 scheme. The biopsy protocol included MRI-MicroUS fusion and MicroUS targeted biopsies; systematic biopsies were performed at clinician's discretion. The diagnostic value was evaluated in terms of detection rate of clinically significant prostate cancer, defined as Gleason pattern ≥ 4 at histology.  Results:   - In all, 148 patients with a median age of 69 years (IQR 63-74) and median PSA density of 0.16 ng/ml/cc (0.10-0.23) were included. Clinically significant cancer was detected in 42.5% (63/148) patients. MRI detected 89 lesions in the peripheral zone; 73% (65/89) were visible on MicroUS. Clinically significant cancer was detected in 46.1% (30/65) MRI and MicroUS visible lesions, and in 4.2% (1/24) lesions only visible on mpMRI. MicroUS additionally identified 35 suspicious lesions non-visible on MRI of which clinically significant cancer was present in 25.7% (9/35).

The low sensitivity of serum PSA results in false negatives and can miss high-grade prostate cancers. We describe a non-invasive test for detection of prostate cancer based on functional enrichment of prostate adenocarcinoma associated circulating tumor cells (PrAD-CTCs) from blood samples followed by their identification by immunostaining for pan-cytokeratins (PanCK), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), alpha methyl-acyl coenzyme-A racemase (AMACR), epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), and common leucocyte antigen (CD45).  Methods:   Analytical validation studies were performed to establish the performance characteristics of the test using VCaP prostate cancer cells spiked into healthy donor blood (HDB). The clinical performance characteristics of the test were evaluated in a case-control study with 160 known prostate cancer cases and 800 healthy males, followed by a prospective clinical study of 210 suspected cases of prostate cancer.  Results:   Analytical validation established analyte stability as well as acceptable performance characteristics. The test showed 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity to differentiate prostate cancer cases from healthy individuals in the case control study and 91.2% sensitivity and 100% specificity to differentiate prostate cancers from benign prostate conditions in the prospective clinical study.  Conclusions:   The test accurately detects PrAD-CTCs with high sensitivity and specificity irrespective of stage, serum PSA or Gleason score, which translates into low risks of false negatives or overdiagnosis.

However, it is unclear which patients are the potential beneficiaries.  Methods:   We obtained information on prostate cancer patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database and divided eligible patients into the local treatment group and non-local treatment group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to reduce the influence of confounding factors. In the matched local treatment (LT) group, if the median overall survival time (OS) was longer than the Nonlocal treatment (NLT) group, it was defined as a benefit group, otherwise, it was a non-benefit group. Then, univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to screen out predictors associated with benefits, and a nomogram model was constructed based on these factors. The accuracy and clinical value of the models were assessed through calibration plots and decision curve analysis.  Results:   The study enrolled 7255 eligible patients, and after PSM, each component included 1923 patients. After matching, the median OS was still higher in the LT group than in the NLT group [42 (95% confidence interval: 39-45) months vs 40 (95% confidence interval: 38-42) months, p = 0.03]. The independent predictors associated with benefit were age, PSA, Gleason score, T stage, N stage, and M stage. The nomogram model has high accuracy and clinical application value in both the training set (C-index = 0.725) and the validation set (C-index = 0.664).

However, the association between cuproptosis-related long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) signature and the prognosis in prostate carcinoma remains elusive. This study aims to develop the novel cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature in prostate cancer and explore its latent molecular function.  Methods:   RNA-seq data and clinical information were downloaded from the TCGA datasets. Then, cuproptosis-related gene was identified from the previous literature and further applied to screen the cuproptosis-related differentially expressed lncRNAs. Patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort or the validation cohort with a 1:1 ratio. Subsequently, the machine learning algorithms (Lasso and stepwise Cox (direction = both)) were used to construct a novel prognostic signature in the training cohorts, which was validated by the validation and the entire TCGA cohorts. The nomogram base on the lncRNA signature and several clinicopathological traits were constructed to predict the prognosis. Functional enrichment and immune analysis were performed to evaluate its potential mechanism. Furthermore, differences in the landscape of gene mutation, tumour mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), drug sensitivity between both risk groups were also assessed to explicit their relationships.  Results:   The cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature was constructed based on the differentially expressed cuproptosis-related lncRNAs, including AC005790.1, AC011472.4, AC099791.2, AC144450.1, LIPE-AS1, and STPG3-AS1. Kaplan-Meier survival and ROC curves demonstrate that the prognosis signature as an independent risk indicator had excellent potential to predict the prognosis in prostate cancer. The signature was closely associated with age, T stage, N stage, and the Gleason score. Immune analysis shows that the high-risk group was in an immunosuppressive microenvironment. Additionally, the significant difference in landscape of gene mutation, tumour mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and drug sensitivity between both risk groups was observed.  Conclusions:   A novel cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature was constructed using machine learning algorithms to predict the prognosis of prostate cancer. It was closely with associated with several common clinical traits, immune cell infiltration, immune-related functions, immune checkpoints, gene mutation, TMB, MSI, and the drug sensitivity, which may be useful to improve the clinical outcome.""","""['Xiaofeng Cheng#', 'Zhenhao Zeng#', 'Heng Yang#', 'Yujun Chen', 'Yifu Liu', 'Xiaochen Zhou', 'Cheng Zhang', 'Gongxian Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['A novel cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature predicts the prognosis and immunotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'A novel cuproptosis-related lncRNA signature predicts the prognosis and immune landscape in bladder cancer.', 'Prognostic signature construction and immunotherapy response analysis for Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma based on cuproptosis-related lncRNAs.', 'Identification of a novel cuproptosis-related gene signature and integrative analyses in patients with lower-grade gliomas.', 'Machine learning algorithm to construct cuproptosis- and immune-related prognosis prediction model for colon cancer.', 'Identification of novel molecular subtypes and a signature to predict prognosis and therapeutic response based on cuproptosis-related genes in prostate cancer.', 'Cuproptosis Regulates Microenvironment and Affects Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.']"""

However, the availability of PSMA PET/CT is limited in both low-resource settings and for repeating imaging surveillance. In contrast, CT is widely available, cost-effective, and routinely performed as part of patient follow-up or radiotherapy workflow. Compared with the molecular activities, the morphological and texture changes of subclinical LNs in CT are subtle, making manual detection of positive LNs infeasible. Instead, we harness the power of artificial intelligence for automated LN detection on CT. We examined 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images from 88 patients (including 739 PSMA PET/CT-positive pelvic LNs) who experienced a biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy and presented for salvage radiotherapy with prostate-specific antigen < 1 ng/mL.

Using PSMA PET/CT as the ground truth and consensus pelvic LN clinical target volumes as search regions, a 2.5-dimensional (2.5D) Mask R-CNN based object detection framework was trained. The entire framework contained whole slice imaging pretraining, masked-out region fine-tuning, prediction post-processing, and ""window bagging"".

Cancer registries collect data only on de novo MPC, providing a partial picture of the burden of MPC. We use cancer registry data to estimate the number of men living with MPC in the United States including both de novo and recurrent cases.  Methods:   We apply a back-calculation method to estimate MPC incidence and prevalence from U.S. prostate cancer mortality and de novo MPC relative survival for cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2017 in 18 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. We hold overall prostate cancer mortality and MPC survival constant for future prevalence projections.  Results:   On January 1, 2018, we estimated 120,400 U.S. men living with MPC (45% de novo, 55% recurrent). The age-adjusted prevalence in 2018 for Black men was over double that of White men (137.1 vs. 62.2 per 100,000 men). By 2030, 192,500 men are expected to be living with MPC, with the increase being driven by population growth projections.  Conclusions:   The number of men living with MPC in the United States exceeds 100,000 and represents a small fraction of the >3 million men living with a prior diagnosis of prostate cancer.  Impact:   Relatively similar fractions of de novo and recurrent MPC among prevalent cases highlight opportunities for management of localized disease in reducing the MPC burden. Changes in diagnostic technologies could lead to greater growth in MPC cases in the United States than projected.

The stage of cancer at diagnosis is an important determinant of survival, reflecting the extent and spread at the time of disease detection. This work provides stage-specific, five-year survival results not previously available for Canada.  Data and methods:   Data reflect the population-based Canadian Cancer Registry death-linked analytic file covering the period from 2010 to 2017. The stage at diagnosis was determined by the Collaborative Stage Data Collection System. Five-year net survival (NS) estimates for Canada excluding Quebec were derived using the Pohar Perme estimator for the five most commonly diagnosed cancers.  Results:   Except for prostate cancer, NS decreased monotonically with increased stage at diagnosis. For example, female breast cancer NS estimates were 100% (stage I), 92% (stage II), 74% (stage III) and 23% (stage IV). Apart from lung cancer, stage I NS exceeded 90% for all cancers studied. The largest sex-specific difference in NS was for lung cancer stage I (female 66%; male 56%). Stage-specific NS generally decreased with age, particularly for early-stage lung cancer. Between the 2010-to-2012 and 2015-to-2017 periods, NS improved among stage IV prostate, female breast and lung cancer cases, as well as for stage I and III lung cancer cases; however, it did not improve at any stage for colon or rectal cancer cases.  Interpretation:   The work highlights the importance of detecting cancer early, when treatment is most effective.

Our objective was to assess the impact of artificial urinary sphincter placement on bladder neck contracture recurrence among prostate cancer survivors with stress urinary incontinence and bladder neck contracture.  Materials and methods:   Men electing artificial urinary sphincter placement at our institution undergo synchronous bladder neck contracture treatment if indicated. An institutional database was queried for men with stress urinary incontinence and ≥1 intervention for bladder neck contracture. Records were divided according to whether an artificial urinary sphincter was ever placed. The impact of artificial urinary sphincter placement on bladder neck contracture recurrence was assessed using a multivariable conditional survival analysis, with survival defined as the recurrence-free interval following bladder neck contracture intervention. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed on the basis of Schoenfeld residuals.  Results:   The analytic cohort consisted of 118 in the artificial urinary sphincter group and 88 in the non-artificial urinary sphincter group. Patients in both groups underwent a median of 2 (range 1-8) bladder neck contracture interventions over the entire course of their care, encompassing 445 total bladder neck contracture interventions. The artificial urinary sphincter group was on average 2.6 years younger (P = .02) and had a higher pack-year smoking history (P < .01). The presence of an artificial urinary sphincter was associated with a 61% lower bladder neck contracture re-intervention rate (HR 0.39, P < .01, CI 0.30-0.50) at any time when accounting for number of prior bladder neck contracture interventions and bladder neck contracture risk factors.  Conclusions:   Artificial urinary sphincter placement is associated with a lower rate of bladder neck contracture re-intervention. Artificial urinary sphincter placement should not be delayed or avoided due to the presence of bladder neck contracture.""","""['Kevin Krughoff', 'Andrew C Peterson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Outcome analysis of urethral wall stent insertion with artificial urinary sphincter placement for severe recurrent bladder neck contracture following radical prostatectomy.', 'Combined stent and artificial urinary sphincter for management of severe recurrent bladder neck contracture and stress incontinence after prostatectomy: a long-term evaluation.', 'Deep lateral transurethral incisions for recurrent bladder neck contracture: promising 5-year experience using a standardized approach.', 'Two-stage management of severe postprostatectomy bladder neck contracture associated with stress incontinence.', 'Salvage surgery for bladder outlet obstruction after prostatectomy or cystectomy.']"""

However, its value as a treatment response assessment tool after MDRT remains unclear. Importantly, there is limited understanding of the potential of radiotherapy (RT) to alter PSMA gene (folate hydrolase 1; FOLH1) expression.  Methodology:   We reviewed a series of 11 men with oligo-metastatic PrCa (25 metastasis sites) treated with MDRT before re-staging with 18F-DCFPyL (PSMA) PET upon secondary recurrence. Acute effects of RT on PSMA protein and mRNA levels were examined with qPCR and immunoblotting in human wild-type androgen-sensitive (LNCap), castrate-resistant (22RV1) and castrate-resistant neuroendocrine (PC3 and DU145) PrCa cell lines. Xenograft tumors were analyzed with immunohistochemistry. Further, we examined PSMA expression in untreated and irradiated radio-resistant (RR) 22RV1 (22RV1-RR) and DU145 (DU145-RR) cells and xenografts selected for survival after high-dose RT.  Results:   The majority of MDRT-treated lesions showed lack of PSMA-PET/CT avidity, suggesting treatment response even after low biological effective dose (BED) MDRT. We observed similar high degree of heterogeneity of PSMA expression in both human specimens and in xenograft tumors. PSMA was highly expressed in LNCap and 22RV1 cells and tumors but not in the neuroendocrine PC3 and DU145 models. Single fraction RT caused detectable reduction in PSMA protein but not in mRNA levels in LNCap cells and did not significantly alter PSMA protein or mRNA levels in tissue culture or xenografts of the other cell lines. However, radio-resistant 22RV1-RR cells and tumors demonstrated marked decrease of PSMA transcript and protein expression over their parental counterparts.  Conclusions:   PSMA-PET may be a promising tool to assess RT response in oligo-metastatic PrCa.

In the TP-induced BPH rat model, PGWE alleviated the pathological markers of BPH such as weight and epithelial thickness of the prostate, and the serum level of dihydrotestosterone. PGWE downregulated androgen-related BPH factors such as 5α-reductase 2 and androgen receptor. PGWE also showed prostatic cell apoptosis accompanied by increased expression of Bax and decreased expression of Bcl-xL and cleaved-caspase 3, respectively, in addition to increasing mitochondrial dynamics in both in vivo and in vitro BPH models. Notably, reduced sperm count, one of the serious side effects of Fi, in the epididymis of BPH rats was recovered with PGWE treatment, suggesting less toxicity to sperm development by PGWE. PGWE also protected against Fi-induced sperm loss when PGWE was administered in combination with Fi without compromising the therapeutic effects of Fi on BPH.

Methods:   Seven patients who experienced endoscopic resection of gastric neuroendocrine tumor were enrolled. Dynamic total-body PET/CT scans over 60 min were performed. Time-activity curves were obtained by drawing regions of interest in normal organs. Rate constants, including K 1, k 2, k 3, and vB, were computed using a two-tissue compartment model. Factor analysis was used to compare the rate constants among subjects and regions. Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to identify organs with similar kinetic characteristics.  Results:   The highest uptake of 68Ga-DOTATATE was observed in the spleen followed by kidneys, adrenals, liver, pituitary gland, pancreas head, prostate, pancreas body, and thyroid, parotid, and submandibular glands. Low background level of 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake was observed in the nasal mucosa, bone, blood pool, and cerebrum. In addition, the uptake in the pancreas head was noted to be higher than the pancreas body (P < 0.001) on the basis of each time point of dynamic PET. There were differences of rate constants among different organs. The mean K 1 ranged from 0.0507 min-1 in the left nasal mucosa to 1.21 min-1 in the left kidney, and mean k 2 ranged from 0.0174 min-1 in the spleen to 4.4487 min-1 in the left cerebrum. The mean k 3 ranged from 0.0563 min-1 in the right cerebrum to 4.6309 min-1 in the left adrenal, and mean vB ranged from 0.0001 in the left cerebrum to 0.2489 in the right adrenal. However, none of the rate constants was significantly different among subjects or among different sites within a single organ. Three groups of organs with similar kinetic characteristics were identified: (1) cerebrum; (2) pituitary gland, liver, adrenal, and prostate; and (3) nasal mucosa, parotid and submandibular glands, thyroid, spleen, pancreas, kidney, and bone.

We analyzed the differential expression of Annexin A2 in different tumors and its relationship with cancer prognosis, immune cell infiltration, DNA methylation, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair (MMR). Furtherly, we conducted a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify the Annexin A2-related pathways. Results: Annexin A2 expression was upregulated in most cancers, except in kidney chromophobe (KICH) and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). Annexin A2 showed a good diagnostic efficacy in twelve types of cancer. The high expression of Annexin A2 was significantly associated with a reduced overall survival, disease-specific survival and progression-free interval in seven cancers. The Annexin A2 expression was variably associated with infiltration of 24 types of immune cells in 32 tumor microenvironments. In addition, Annexin A2 expression was differently associated with 47 immune checkpoints, immunoregulators, DNA methylation, tumor mutation burden, microsatellite instability and mismatch repair in pan-cancer.

It remains to be established whether active surveillance (AS) for PCa represents a safe treatment option in this setting. Therefore, we aim to compare AS discontinuation and oncological outcomes of AS for PCa of RTR vs. non-transplant patients.  Methods:   Multicentre study including RTR diagnosed with PCa between 2008 and 2018 in whom AS was initiated. A subgroup of non-RTR from the St. Antonius hospital AS cohort was used as a control group. Comparison of RTR vs. non-RTR was performed by 2:1 propensity score matched survival analysis. Outcome measures included tumour progression-free survival, treatment-free survival, metastasis rates, biochemical recurrence rates and overall survival. Patients were matched based on age, year of diagnosis, PSA, biopsy ISUP grade group, relative number of positive biopsy cores and clinical stage.  Results:   A total of 628 patients under AS were evaluated, including 17 RTRs and 611 non-RTRs. A total of 13 RTR cases were matched with 24 non-RTR cases. Median overall follow-up for the RTR and non-RTR matched cases was, respectively, 5.1 (IQR 3.2-8.7) years and 5.7 (IQR 4.8-8.1) years. There were no events of metastasis and biochemical recurrence among matched cases. The matched-pair analysis results in a 1-year and 5-year survival of the RTR and non-RTR patients were, respectively, 100 vs. 92%, and 39 vs. 76% for tumour progression, 100 vs. 91% and 59 vs. 76% for treatment-free survival and, respectively, 100 vs. 100% and 88 vs. 100% for overall survival. No significant differences in tumour progression-free survival (p = 0.07) and treatment-free survival were observed (p = 0.3). However, there was a significant difference in overall survival comparing both groups (p = 0.046).  Conclusions:   AS may be carefully considered in RTR with low-risk PCa.

Design, setting, and participants:   A formal consensus process was followed, with an international expert panel of purposively sampled participants across a range of health care professionals and researchers, and those with lived experience of prostate cancer. Statements regarding the practice of AS and potential research priorities spanning the patient journey from surveillance to initiating treatment were developed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Panel members scored each statement on a Likert scale. The group median score and measure of consensus were presented to participants prior to discussion and rescoring at panel meetings. Current best practice and future research priorities were identified, agreed upon, and finally ranked by panel members.  Results and limitations:   There was consensus agreement that best practice includes the use of high-quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which allows digital rectal examination (DRE) to be omitted, that repeat standard biopsy can be omitted when MRI and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics are stable, and that changes in PSA or DRE should prompt MRI ± biopsy rather than immediate active treatment. The highest ranked research priority was a dynamic, risk-adjusted AS approach, reducing testing for those at the least risk of progression. Improving the tests used in surveillance, ensuring equity of access and experience across different patients and settings, and improving information and communication between and within clinicians and patients were also high priorities. Limitations include the use of a limited number of panel members for practical reasons.  Conclusions:   The current best practice in AS includes the use of high-quality MRI to avoid DRE and as the first assessment for changes in PSA, with omission of repeat standard biopsy when PSA and MRI are stable. Development of a robust, dynamic, risk-adapted approach to surveillance is the highest research priority in AS for prostate cancer.  Patient summary:   A diverse group of experts in active surveillance, including a broad range of health care professionals and researchers and those with lived experience of prostate cancer, agreed that best practice includes the use of high-quality magnetic resonance imaging, which can allow digital rectal examination and some biopsies to be omitted. The highest research priority in active surveillance research was identified as the development of a dynamic, risk-adjusted approach.""","""['Caroline M Moore', 'Lauren E King', 'John Withington', 'Mahul B Amin', 'Mark Andrews', 'Erik Briers', 'Ronald C Chen', 'Francis I Chinegwundoh', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Jane Crowe', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Margaret I Fitch', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Francesco Giganti', 'Masoom A Haider', 'John Freeman', 'Joseph Gallo', 'Stephen Gibbs', 'Anthony Henry', 'Nicholas James', 'Netty Kinsella', 'Thomas B L Lam', 'Mark Lichty', 'Stacy Loeb', 'Brandon A Mahal', 'Ken Mastris', 'Anita V Mitra', 'Samuel W D Merriel', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Mieke Van Hemelrijck', 'Nynikka R Palmer', 'Catherine C Paterson', 'Monique J Roobol', 'Phillip Segal', 'James A Schraidt', 'Camille E Short', 'M Minhaj Siddiqui', 'Clare M C Tempany', 'Arnaud Villers', 'Howard Wolinsky', 'Steven MacLennan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Reporting Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: The PRECISE Recommendations-A Report of a European School of Oncology Task Force.', 'Compliance Rates with the Prostate Cancer Research International Active Surveillance (PRIAS) Protocol and Disease Reclassification in Noncompliers.', 'A Multivariable Approach Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Avoid a Protocol-based Prostate Biopsy in Men on Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-Data from the International Multicenter Prospective PRIAS Study.', 'Focal therapy: patients, interventions, and outcomes--a report from a consensus meeting.', 'NIH State-of-the-Science Conference Statement: Role of active surveillance in the management of men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Using a Recurrent Neural Network To Inform the Use of Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) and PSA Density for Dynamic Monitoring of the Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression on Active Surveillance.', 'mpMRI Interpretation in Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer-An overview of the PRECISE score.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.']"""

The results showed that GLIDR expression levels were higher in PCa samples and cells than in control. GLIDR could regulate the invasive potential, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferation in PC-3 and LnCaP cells.

Western blotting proved that miR-128-3p affected the expression of EMT markers, such as E-cadherin, Snail and N-cadherin, and GLIDR could reversed the effects of miR-128-3p on the expression levels of EMT markers in PCa cells. In addition, knockdown of miR-128-3p stimulated the invasion, EMT, and proliferation in PCa cells, whereas these effects were reversed when GLIDR expression was knocked down. GLIDR knockdown inhibited the invasion, EMT, and proliferation in PCa cells, and GLIDR was shown to sponge miR-128-3p.

This study aimed to explore the dynamic change in CTCs during abiraterone plus prednisone therapy and its optimal threshold for prognostication in mCRPC patients.  Methods:   CTCs in blood samples from mCRPC patients (N = 98) at baseline and in the 2nd month after abiraterone plus prednisone treatment initiation (M2) were enumerated by using the CellSearch System.  Results:   CTCs were detected in 64.8% of mCRPC patients at baseline with a median value (interquartile range) of 2.0 (0.0-4.0). Elevated CTC count was related to visceral metastasis (P = 0.003), high alkaline phosphatase (P = 0.043), and high lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.007). Baseline CTC ≥ 1 (vs. < 1) was only associated with shortened radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) (P = 0.043); additionally, baseline CTC ≥ 5 (vs. < 5) was linked with unfavorable rPFS (P = 0.037) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.021). Following the therapy, CTCs were reduced at M2 (P < 0.001). Notably, CTC ≥ 1 (vs. < 1) (P = 0.002) and CTC ≥ 5 (vs. < 5) (P < 0.001) at M2 were related to shortened rPFS according to the Kaplan‒Meier curves, and they could independently estimate deteriorative rPFS in the multivariate Cox regression (P = 0.043 and P = 0.027, respectively). Similarly, CTC ≥ 1 (vs. < 1) (P = 0.022) and CTC ≥ 5 (vs. < 5) (P = 0.002) at M2 were related to shortened OS, whereas only CTC ≥ 5 (vs. < 5) could independently predict unfavorable OS (P = 0.017).

The search for novel and efficient anti-CRPC agents is therefore extremely important. WM-3835 is a cell-permeable, potent and first-in-class HBO1 (KAT7 or MYST2) inhibitor. Here in primary human prostate cancer cells-derived from CRPC patients, WM-3835 potently inhibited cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression and in vitro cell migration. The HBO1 inhibitor provoked apoptosis in the prostate cancer cells. It failed to induce significant cytotoxicity and apoptosis in primary human prostate epithelial cells. shRNA-induced silencing of HBO1 resulted in robust anti-prostate cancer cell activity as well, and adding WM-3835 failed to induce further cytotoxicity in the primary prostate cancer cells. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of HBO1 further augmented primary prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration. WM-3835 inhibited H3-H4 acetylation and downregulated several pro-cancerous genes (CCR2, MYLK, VEGFR2, and OCIAD2) in primary CRPC cells. Importantly, HBO1 mRNA and protein levels are significantly elevated in CRPC tissues and cells. In vivo, daily intraperitoneal injection of WM-3835 potently inhibited pPC-1 xenograft growth in nude mice, and no apparent toxicities detected. Moreover, intratumoral injection of HBO1 shRNA adeno-associated virus (AAV) suppressed the growth of primary prostate cancer xenografts in nude mice. H3-H4 histone acetylation and HBO1-dependent genes (CCR2, MYLK, VEGFR2, and OCIAD2) were remarkably decreased in WM-3835-treated or HBO1-silenced xenograft tissues.

Thus, the chemopreventive possibility of narirutin was investigated in PC-3 cells by utilising cytotoxicity assays. Further, a mechanism was deduced targeting hyaluronidase, an early-stage diagnosis marker, by cell-free, cell-based and in silico studies. The results indicate that narirutin reduced the viability of PC-3 cells with the inhibitory concentration range of 66.87-59.80 μM. It induced G0/G1 phase arrest with a fold change of 1.12. Besides, it increased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with a fold change of 1.34 at 100 μM. Narirutin inhibited hyaluronidase's activity in cell-free (11.17 μM) and cell-based assays (67.23 μM) and showed a strong binding interaction with hyaluronidase. Finally, the MD simulation analysis supported the idea that narirutin binding enhanced compactness and stability and created a stable complex with hyaluronidase. In addition, ADMET prediction indicates that it is a non-toxic, non-CYPs inhibitor and thus didn't alter the metabolism.

Oligometastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (omCSPC) represents a unique state of disease in which metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) has demonstrated improvement in progression-free survival. Herein, we investigate the clinical implications of genomic alterations in the WNT signaling cascade in men with omCSPC.  Methods and materials:   We performed an international multi-institutional retrospective study of 277 men with metachronous omCSPC who underwent targeted DNA sequencing of their primary/metastatic tumor. Patients were classified by presence or absence of pathogenic WNT pathway mutations (in the genes APC, RNF43, and CTNNB1). Pearson χ2 and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine differences in clinical factors between genomic strata. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated for radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, stratified according to WNT pathway mutation status.  Results:   A pathogenic WNT pathway mutation was detected in 11.2% of patients. Patients with WNT pathway mutations were more likely to have visceral metastases (22.6% vs 2.8%; P < .01) and less likely to have regional lymph node metastases (29.0% vs 50.4%; P = .02). At time of oligometastasis, these patients were treated with MDT alone (33.9%), MDT + limited course of systemic therapy (20.6%), systemic therapy alone (22.4%), or observation (defined as no treatment for ≥6 months after metastatic diagnosis). Multivariable cox regression demonstrated WNT pathway mutations associated with significantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio, 3.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-12.00).  Conclusions:   Somatic WNT pathway alterations are present in approximately 11% of patients with omCSPC and are associated with an increased likelihood of visceral metastases.

However, a lack of relevant models has prevented the full understanding of the effects of human BM-adipocytes in this microenvironment. It is hypothesized that the combination of tunable gelatin methacrylamide (GelMA)-based hydrogels with the biomimetic culture of human cells would offer a versatile 3D platform to engineer human bone tumor microenvironments containing BM-adipocytes. Human osteoprogenitors, adipocytes, and PCa cells are individually cultured in vitro in GelMA hydrogels, leading to mineralized, adipose, and PCa tumor 3D microtissues, respectively. Osteoblast mineralization and tumor spheroid formation are tailored by hydrogel stiffness with lower stiffnesses correlating with increased mineralization and tumor spheroid size. Upon coculture with tumor cells, BM-adipocytes undergo morphological changes and delipidation, suggesting reciprocal interactions between the cell types.

Using this model, an increase in tumor burden is observed when human adipocytes are present, suggesting that adipocytes support early bone tumor growth.

A translational substudy within the CHHiP trial of radiotherapy fractionation evaluated whether these could improve prediction of prognosis and assist treatment stratification following either conventional or hypofractionated radiotherapy.  Methods:   Using case:control methodology, patients with biochemical or clinical failure after radiotherapy (BCR) were matched to patients without recurrence according to established prognostic factors (Gleason score, presenting PSA, tumour-stage) and fractionation schedule. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of diagnostic biopsy sections was performed and scored for HIF1α, Bcl-2, Ki67, Geminin, p16, p53, p-chk1 and PTEN. Univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression models, adjusted for matching strata and age, estimated the prognostic value of each IHC biomarker, including interaction terms to determine BCR prediction according to fractionation.  Findings:   IHC results were available for up to 336 tumours. PTEN, Geminin, mean Ki67 and max Ki67 were prognostic after adjusting for multiple comparisons and were fitted in a multivariable model (n = 212, 106 matched pairs). Here, PTEN and Geminin showed significant prediction of prognosis. No marker predicted BCR according to fractionation.  Interpretation:   Geminin or Ki67, and PTEN, predicted response to radiotherapy independently of established prognostic factors. These results provide essential independent external validation of previous findings and confirm a role for these markers in treatment stratification.

Despite prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) being widely expressed in the tissue of PCa, no definite conclusion regarding their use as clinical biomarkers due to their lacking organ specificity. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the peripheral blood levels of PSMA and PSCA mRNAs and examine their diagnostic significance as non-invasive integrated markers.<br /><br />Materials and Methods: 125 subjects were enrolled in this study. They were divided into 25 healthy controls, 25 BPH patients, and 75 PCa patients. The expression levels of PSMA and PSCA were determined using quantitative RT- PCR, in addition to measuring serum PSA.<br /><br />Results: Levels of PSMA and PSCA were over-expressed in PCa patients compared to controls and BPH patients and were found to be associated with increased susceptibility to PCa. Moreover, the diagnostic values of PSMA and PSCA to distinguish PCa patients from BPH patients and controls were inferior to that of PSA. However, the combination of PSMA and PSCA with PSA enhanced the efficacy of the latter.<br /><br />Conclusion: This study suggests that these genes were associated with malignant susceptibility.

Methods:   A retrospective multicenter cohort study in prostate cancer patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was conducted at 10 institutions in Japan. Pre- and post-operative outcomes were collected from enrolled patients. Biochemical recurrence and clinical and pathological variables were evaluated among subgroups with different positive surgical margin locations.  Results:   A total of 3195 patients enrolled in this study. Data from 2667 patients (70.1% [N = 1869] with negative surgical margins and 29.9% [N = 798] with positive surgical margins based on robot-assisted radical prostatectomy specimens) were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 25.0 months. The numbers of patients with apex-only, middle-only, bladder-neck-only, seminal-vesicle-only and multifocal positive surgical margins were 401, 175, 159, 31 and 32, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, PSA level at surgery, pathological Gleason score based on robot-assisted radical prostatectomy specimens, pathological T stage, pathological N stage and surgical margin status were independent risk factors significantly associated with biochemical recurrence-free survival. Patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with multifocal positive surgical margins and seminal-vesicle-only positive surgical margins were associated with worse biochemical recurrence-free survival than those with apex-only, middle-only and bladder-neck-only positive surgical margins. Patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with apex-only positive surgical margins, the most frequent positive surgical margin location, were associated with more favorable biochemical recurrence-free survival that those with middle-only and bladder-neck-only positive surgical margins. The study limitations included the lack of central pathological specimen evaluation.

Before introducing a nationwide lung cancer screening program in Germany, it is important to assess the criteria used in international trials in the German population.  Methods:   We used data from 3623 lung cancer patients from the data warehouse of the German Center for Lung Research (DZL). We compared the sensitivity of the following lung cancer screening criteria overall and stratified by age and histology: the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), the Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST), the 2013 and 2021 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and an adapted version of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian no race model (adapted PLCOm2012) with 6-year risk thresholds of 1.0%/6 year and 1.7%/6 year.  Results:   Overall, the adapted PLCOm2012 model (1%/6 years), selected the highest proportion of lung cancer patients for screening (72.4%), followed by the 2021 USPSTF (70.0%), the adapted PLCOm2012 (1.7%/6 year) (57.4%), the 2013 USPTF (57.0%), DLCST criteria (48.7%), and the NLST (48.5%). The adapted PLCOm2012 risk model (1.0%/6 year) had the highest sensitivity for all histological types except for small-cell and large-cell carcinomas (non-significant), whereas the 2021 USPTF selected a higher proportion of patients. The sensitivity levels were higher in males than in females.  Conclusion:   Using a risk-based selection score resulted in higher sensitivities compared to criteria using dichotomized age and smoking history. However, gender disparities were apparent in all studied eligibility criteria. In light of increasing lung cancer incidences in women, all selection criteria should be reviewed for ways to close this gender gap, especially when implementing a large-scale lung cancer screening program.""","""['Julia Walter', 'Diego Kauffmann-Guerrero', 'Thomas Muley', 'Martin Reck', 'Jan Fuge', 'Andreas Günther', 'Raphael W Majeed', 'Rajkumar Savai', 'Ina Koch', 'Julien Dinkel', 'Christian Schneider', 'Karsten Senghas', 'Sonja Kobinger', 'Farkhad Manapov', 'Michael Thomas', 'Kathrin Kahnert', 'Hauke Winter', 'Jürgen Behr', 'Martin Tammemägi', 'Amanda Tufman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Addressing Sex Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility: USPSTF vs\xa0PLCOm2012 Criteria.', 'Race & sex disparities related to low-dose computed tomography lung cancer screening eligibility criteria: A lung cancer cases review.', 'Risk prediction models for selection of lung cancer screening candidates: A retrospective validation study.', 'Evaluation of the Benefits and Harms of Lung Cancer Screening With Low-Dose Computed Tomography: A Collaborative Modeling Study for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Selecting lung cancer screenees using risk prediction models-where do we go from here.']"""
