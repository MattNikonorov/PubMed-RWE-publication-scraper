An inverse relationship between BPH/prostate size and PCa incidence is well documented in the current literature, but the precise mechanism is poorly understood. This study aims to investigate the effect of total prostate volume on total glandular tissue volume of the peripheral zone via a novel combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histo-anatomical imaging.  Methods:   42 male patients between ages 53-79 years underwent both radical prostatectomy and pre-operative MRI scans. Prostate sizes ranged from 14.8-133.3cc. Quantitative measurements of surgical capsule thickness and glandular epithelial cell density within the peripheral zone (PZ) were obtained on histo-anatomical slides using computer-based imaging software. Quantitative prostatic zonal measurements were obtained from MRI scans. Combining MRI- and histopathology-obtained parameters allowed measurement of the total glandular tissue volume of the PZ (GVPZ). Statistical analysis was performed to identify associations between total prostate volume (TPV) and GVPZ.  Results:   The Mann-Whitney U-test showed significant decreases in GVPZ in larger prostates when compared to smaller prostates.  Conclusions:   Combined MRI and histopathology techniques provide a novel method for accurate measuring of glandular tissue content within the prostatic PZ. The findings of this pilot study support the hypothesis of PZ compression by an expanding transition zone in large BPH prostates, leading to atrophy of PZ glandular tissue. As the majority of PCa originates in the PZ, this dynamic process may explain the protective effect of large BPH prostates against PCa development.""","""['Benjamin Lin', 'Irina Kim Cavdar', 'Matthew Buxton', 'Jake Sellers', 'Luis Brandi', 'Naseem Helo', 'Werner T W de Riese']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Possible clinical implications of prostate capsule thickness and glandular epithelial cell density in benign prostate hyperplasia.', 'Association Between Prostate Size and MRI Determined Quantitative Prostate Zonal Measurements.', 'Quantitative measurements of prostate capsule and gland density and their correlation to prostate size: possible clinical implications in prostate cancer.', 'Any Correlation Between Prostate Volume and Incidence of Prostate Cancer: A Review of Reported Data for the Last Thirty Years.', 'MRI determined prostate volume and the incidence of prostate cancer on MRI-fusion biopsy: a systemic review of reported data for the last 20\xa0years.']"""

Palliative care specialist (PCS) co-management should be considered at the latest after a 6-month prognosis has been presumed. Therefore, identifying patients with a limited prognosis is a reasonable measure.  Methods:   Patients were identified using a screening tool for limited prognosis, which combined their tumor stage and data from the nursing anamnesis. In this retrospective study, a monocentric cohort of patients with urological malignancies-UICC (Union for International Cancer Control) stages III and IV - were enrolled from March to December 2019, with a 6-month follow-up period ending in May 2020.  Results:   Most patients were male and suffered from prostate cancer. Patients with uro-oncological tumors dying within 6 months correlated significantly with the presence of repeated hospitalizations within three months, pain on admission, malnutrition, impaired breathing and reduced mobility (P < 0.001). The test was fair in quality (AUC 0.727) at a cut-point of five; a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 25% were obtained. The PPV was 0.64 and NPV was 0.82.  Discussion/conclusion:   We specifically identified the predictors of limited prognosis in urological cancer patients across several entities using an automated scoring system based on tumor stage and data from the nursing anamnesis. Therefore, we recognized hospitalization as an important transition point and determined nurses to be valuable partners in identifying unmet palliative care needs without additional technical, personnel or financial effort.""","""['Carmen Roch', 'Julian Alexander Kielkopf', 'Ulrich Stefenelli', 'Hubert Kübler', 'Birgitt van Oorschot', 'Anna Katharina Seitz']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of hospital-based specialist palliative care for adults with advanced illness and their caregivers.', 'Transition Points for the Routine Integration of Palliative Care in Patients With Advanced Cancer.', 'Pretherapeutic evaluation of patients with upper gastrointestinal tract cancer using endoscopic and laparoscopic ultrasonography.', 'When to Integrate Palliative Care in the Trajectory of Cancer Care.']"""

Patients and methods:   An institutional prostate SBRT database was interrogated for patients treated between January 2018 and December 2021 with salvage SBRT for intraprostatic recurrences who were previously treated with LDR brachytherapy. Patients received 30 to 34 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate with a simultaneous integrated boost of 34 to 37.5 Gy to gross disease. The maximum urethral dose allowed was 34 Gy. Toxicities were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0.  Results:   Eleven patients met our study's inclusion criteria with a median follow-up time of 37.9 months (range, 24.3-51.8 months). Median time between LDR brachytherapy and salvage SBRT was 7 years (range, 2-11 years) with a median PSA of 3.15 ng/mL (range, 0.90-9.83) at the time of salvage radiation. All 11 patients were alive at the time of last follow-up. Our 3-year Kaplan-Meier progression-free survival rate was 70.1%. Median time to recurrence was 24.1 months (range, 18.7-29.7 months). Late (≥3 months) grade 1, 2, and 3 urinary toxicity rates were 27.3%, 36.4%, and 9.1%, respectively. Late (≥3 months) grade 1, 2, and 3 gastrointestinal toxicity rates were 18.2%, 0%, and 9.1%, respectively.  Conclusion:   Homogeneous salvage SBRT to the prostate with urethral dose minimization has a favorable safety and efficacy profile for treating intra-prostatic recurrences following LDR brachytherapy.

However, it remains unclear to what extent the presence of these morphological features in prostate biopsy specimens, as diagnosed by hematoxylin-eosin-stained specimens only, affects the clinicopathological impact. In this study, we summarized the characteristics of the cribriform pattern and IDC-P in 850 prostate biopsy cases. The results showed a statistically significant increase in the incidence of cribriform pattern and IDC-P as grade group (GG) increased (especially in cases ≥ GG4, Chi-square test P < 0.001). The independent risk factors for cribriform pattern and IDC-P in biopsy specimens in the multivariate logistic regression analysis were the former GG, presence of IDC-P, lesion length of the highest GG core, latter GG, presence of the cribriform pattern, number of biopsies obtained, and number of highest GG core. Overall, 125 cases in which radical prostatectomy was conducted after biopsy were selected for further analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis using biopsy and surgical specimens confirmed that the presence of the cribriform pattern and IDC-P in biopsy specimens were independent risk factors for lymph node metastasis (odds ratios [95% confidence interval] were 6.54 [1.15-37.05] for the cribriform pattern and 23.71 [1.74-322.42] for IDC-P).

Existing studies have demonstrated that circ_0057558 may be a molecular marker affecting PCa. However, its detailed roles in PCa remain unclear.  Methods:   The levels of circ_0057558, miR-1238-3p and Septin 2 (SEPT2) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation assay, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay, flow cytometry assay, wound healing assay, transwell assay and tube formation assay were conducted for cell function identification. Xenograft tumor experiment was used to test the effect of circ_0057558 in vivo. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were conducted to determine the relationships between miR-1238-3p and circ_0057558 or SEPT2.  Results:   We identified that circ_0057558 level was elevated in PCa, and silencing circ_0057558 restrained PCa cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Circ_0057558 could sponge miR-1238-3p, and SEPT2 was the target of miR-1238-3p. Circ_0057558 promoted the expression of SEPT2 by negatively regulating miR-1238-3p, resulting in promotion of PCa progression. The effects of circ_0057558 knockdown in PCa development were overturned by the lack of miR-1238-3p. Also, overexpression of SEPT2 abolished the suppressive impacts of miR-1238-3p on PCa progression.  Conclusion:   As a tumor promoter, circ_0057558 regulated the expression of miR-1238-3p and SEPT2 and facilitated PCa progression.

To date, several radiomic and machine learning studies investigated the feasibility of in vivo tumor characterization with variable outcomes. This study aims to investigate the effect of recently proposed fuzzy radiomics and compare its predictive performance to conventional radiomics in cancer imaging cohorts. In addition, lesion vs. lesion+surrounding fuzzy and conventional radiomic analysis was conducted.  Methods:   Previously published 11C Methionine (MET) positron emission tomography (PET) glioma, 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) lung, and 68GA-PSMA-11 PET/magneto-resonance imaging (MRI) prostate cancer retrospective cohorts were included in the analysis to predict their respective clinical endpoints. Four delineation methods including manually defined reference binary (Ref-B), its smoothed, fuzzified version (Ref-F), as well as extended binary (Ext-B) and its fuzzified version (Ext-F) were incorporated to extract imaging biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI)-conform radiomic features from each cohort. Machine learning for the four delineation approaches was performed utilizing a Monte Carlo cross-validation scheme to estimate the predictive performance of the four delineation methods.  Results:   Reference fuzzy (Ref-F) delineation outperformed its binary delineation (Ref-B) counterpart in all cohorts within a volume range of 938-354987 mm3 with relative cross-validation area under the receiver operator characteristics curve (AUC) of +4.7-10.4. Compared to Ref-B, the highest AUC performance difference was observed by the Ref-F delineation in the glioma cohort (Ref-F: 0.74 vs. Ref-B: 0.70) and in the prostate cohort by Ref-F and Ext-F (Ref-F: 0.84, Ext-F: 0.86 vs. Ref-B: 0.80). In addition, fuzzy radiomics decreased feature redundancy by approx. 20%.  Conclusions:   Fuzzy radiomics has the potential to increase predictive performance particularly in small lesion sizes compared to conventional binary radiomics in PET. We hypothesize that this effect is due to the ability of fuzzy radiomics to model partial volume effects and delineation uncertainties at small lesion boundaries. In addition, we consider that the lower redundancy of fuzzy radiomic features supports the identification of imaging biomarkers in future studies.

Among the available therapeutic options, the androgen receptor signaling inhibitors abiraterone acetate plus prednisone (AA) and enzalutamide (Enza), are currently the most used first-line therapies in clinical practice. However, validated clinical indicators of prognosis in this setting are still lacking. In this study, we aimed to evaluate a prognostic model based on the time of metastatic disease presentation (after prior local therapy [PLT] or de-novo [DN]) and disease burden (low volume [LV] or high-volume [HV]) at AA/Enza onset for mCRPC patients receiving either AA or Enza as first-line.  Methods:   A cohort of consecutive patients who started AA or Enza as first-line treatment for mCRPC between January 1st, 2015, and April 1st, 2019 was identified from the clinical and electronic registries of the 9 American and European participating centers. Patients were classified into 4 cohorts by the time of metastatic disease presentation (PLT or DN) and volume of disease (LV or HV; per the E3805 trial, HV was defined as the presence of visceral metastases and/or at least 4 bone metastases of which at least 1 out the axial/pelvic skeleton) at AA/Enza onset. The endpoint was overall survival defined as the time from AA or Enza initiation, respectively, to death from any cause or censored at the last follow-up visit, whichever occurred first.  Results:   Of the 417 eligible patients identified, 157 (37.6%) had LV/PLT, 87 (20.9%) LV/DN, 64 (15.3%) HV/PLT, and 109 (26.1%) HV/DN.

Materials and methods:   In 2003-2004, patients eligible for SPRIT attended a multidisciplinary educational session, following which they could choose radical prostatectomy, low dose rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) or randomisation to SPIRIT. Biochemical failure was determined by the accepted definitions of a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≥0.2 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy and the Phoenix definition of PSA ≥2 ng/ml above the nadir after LDR-BT. A sensitivity analysis, using a PSA >0.5 ng/ml to define biochemical failure after LDR-BT and a threshold PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml, was carried out to test the robustness of the results. To account for the competing risk of death, Gray's test was used to test the equality of the cumulative incidence function of biochemical failure between treatment groups. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival and prostate cancer-specific survival. A P-value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Of 156 patients, 100 received LDR-BT (15 after randomisation) and 56 underwent radical prostatectomy (15 after randomisation). The median follow-up was 12.6 and 14.7 years for LDR-BT and radical prostatectomy, respectively. The median age was 60 years; the median pre-treatment PSA was 5.5 (interquartile range 4.3-7.1). No significant differences in patient characteristics were found between groups. Two patients received adjuvant radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy. The cumulative incidence function of biochemical failure was 0%, 1.1% and 2.4% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively, in the LDR-BT arm versus 8.5%, 15.8% and 15.8% in the radical prostatectomy arm (P < 0.001). These results were consistent when varying the definition of biochemical failure defined as PSA ≥0.5 ng/ml (P = 0.01). At 15 years, overall survival was higher in patients treated with radical prostatectomy compared with those treated with LDR-BT; however, no statistical difference was found in prostate cancer-specific survival.

We sought to evaluate the impact of LE on the cost-effectiveness of radical prostatectomy (RP), radiation therapy (RT), and active surveillance (AS) for clinically localized disease.  Methods:   We created a Markov model to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for RP, RT, and AS over a 20-year time horizon from a Medicare payer perspective for low- and intermediate-risk CaP. Mortality outcomes varied by tumor risk and PCCI score, a validated proxy for LE. We performed 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations with 1-way sensitivity analyses of PCCI within each tumor risk subgroup to compare cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between treatments.  Results:   AS dominated RP and RT for low- and intermediate-risk disease in men with LE ≤10 years (PCCI ≥7 and ≥9, respectively). However, AS failed to dominate RP and RT for men with longer LE. For men with low-risk cancer and LE>10 years (PCCI 0-6), AS had the greatest effectiveness, but failed to dominate due to higher cost relative to RP. For men with intermediate-risk cancer with LE>10 years, AS failed to dominate due to higher cost relative to RP (PCCI 0-8) and lower effectiveness relative to RT (PCCI 0-3). The range of QALYs between RP, RT, and AS varied <13% (range: 0%-12.9%) while costs varied up to 521% (range 0.5%-521%) across PCCI scores.  Conclusions:   LE strongly modulates the cost of CaP treatments. This results in AS dominating RP and RT in men with LE ≤10 years. However, in men with longer LE, AS fails to dominate primarily due to its high cumulative costs, underscoring the need for risk-adjusted AS protocols.""","""['Aurash Naser-Tavakolian', 'Abhishek Venkataramana', 'Brennan Spiegel', 'Christopher Almario', 'Paul Kokorowski', 'Stephen J Freedland', 'Jennifer T Anger', 'John T Leppert', 'Timothy J Daskivich']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Time Trends in Use of Radical Prostatectomy by Tumor Risk and Life Expectancy in a National Veterans Affairs Cohort.', 'Lifetime Health and Economic Outcomes of Active Surveillance, Radical Prostatectomy, and Radiotherapy for Favorable-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Cost-Effectiveness of Primary Radiation Therapy Versus Radical Prostatectomy for Intermediate- to High-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Systematic review of the cost effectiveness of radiation therapy for prostate cancer from 2003 to 2013.']"""

Setting:   Individual electronic primary healthcare records extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.  Participants:   Records for 132 996 patients with a diagnosis of breast, bowel or prostate cancer.  Outcome measures:   Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyse cancer-specific survival associated with exposure to VGSC inhibitors. Exposure to non-VGSC-inhibiting antiepileptic medication and other non-VGSC blockers were also considered. Drug exposure was treated as a time-varying covariate to account for immortal time bias.  Results:   During 1 002 225 person-years of follow-up, there were 42 037 cancer-specific deaths. 53 724 (40.4%) patients with cancer had at least one prescription for a VGSC inhibitor of interest. Increased risk of cancer-specific mortality was associated with exposure to this group of drugs (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.56 to 1.63, p<0.001). This applied to VGSC-inhibiting tricyclic antidepressants (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.50 to 1.65, p<0.001), local anaesthetics (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.43 to 1.55, p<0.001) and anticonvulsants (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.48, p<0.001) and persisted in sensitivity analyses.

Our objective was to examine the effect of rurality and neighborhood socioeconomic and environmental deprivation on patient-reported outcomes and survival in men with prostate cancer in NRG Oncology RTOG 0415.  Methods and materials:   Data from men with prostate cancer in trial NRG Oncology RTOG 0415 were analyzed; 1,092 men were randomized to receive conventional radiation therapy or hypofractionated radiation therapy. Rurality was categorized as urban or rural. Neighborhood deprivation was assessed using the area deprivation index and air pollution indicators (nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 micrometers) via patient ZIP codes. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite measured cancer-specific quality of life. The Hopkins symptom checklist measured anxiety and depression. EuroQoL-5 Dimension assessed general health.  Results:   We analyzed 751 patients in trial NRG Oncology RTOG 0415. At baseline, patients from the most deprived neighborhoods had worse bowel (P = .011), worse sexual (P = .042), and worse hormonal (P = .015) scores; patients from the most deprived areas had worse self-care (P = .04) and more pain (P = .047); and patients from rural areas had worse urinary (P = .03) and sexual (P = .003) scores versus patients from urban areas. Longitudinal analyses showed that the 25% most deprived areas (P = .004) and rural areas (P = .002) were associated with worse EuroQoL-5 Dimension visual analog scale score.

This study sought to define these complex relationships at the US county level for prostate cancer (PC) and invasive breast (BC) cancer to build a tool that facilitates identification of ""radiotherapy deserts""-regions with mismatch between radiation therapy resources and oncologic need.  Methods and materials:   An ecologic study model was constructed using national databases to evaluate 3,141 US counties. Radiation therapy resources and use densities were operationalized as physicians to persons at risk (PPR) and use to persons at risk (UPR): the number of attending radiation oncologists and Medicare beneficiaries per 100,000 persons at risk, respectively. Oncologic need was defined by ""hot zone"" counties with ≥2 standard deviations (SDs) above mean incidence and death rates. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions examined links between PPR and UPR densities, epidemiologic variables, and hot zones for oncologic outcomes. Statistics are reported at a significance level of P < .05.  Results:   The mean (SD) PPR and UPR densities were 2.1 (5.9) and 192.6 (557.6) for PC and 1.9 (5.3) and 174.4 (501.0) for BC, respectively. Counties with high PPR and UPR densities were predominately metropolitan (odds ratio [OR], 2.9-4.4), generally with a higher percentage of Black non-Hispanic constituents (OR, 1.5-2.3). Incidence and death rate hot zones were largely nonmetropolitan (OR, 0.3-0.6), generally with a higher percentage of Black non-Hispanic constituents (OR, 3.2-6.3). Lower PPR density was associated with death rate hot zones for both types of cancer (OR, 0.8-0.9); UPR density was generally not linked to oncologic outcomes on multivariable analysis.  Conclusions:   The study found that mismatch between oncologic need with PPR and UPR disproportionately affects nonmetropolitan communities with a higher percentage of Black non-Hispanic constituents.

Objective:   To explore the causal effect of long-term PM2.5 exposure on mortality from all-site and a variety of site-specific cancers in Jiangsu province, China during 2015-2020 using a difference-in-differences analysis.  Methods:   For each of 53 county-based spatial units in Jiangsu province, we calculated annual death counts for all-site cancer and 23 site-specific cancers. Using a validated high-resolution PM2.5 grid dataset, long-term PM2.5 exposure of a spatial unit within a given year was evaluated as the average of population-weighted annual concentrations during recent 10 years. Conditional Poisson regression models were employed to evaluate exposure-response associations adjusting for spatial and temporal variables, seasonal temperatures, relative humidity, and gross domestic product (GDP).  Results:   During the study period, we identified 947,337 adult cancer deaths in Jiangsu province. Each 1 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with a 2.7% increase in the risk of all-site cancer mortality. PM2.5-mortality associations were also observed in cancer of lip, oral cavity and pharynx, stomach, colorectum, pancreas, lung, bone and joints, ovary, prostate, and lymphoma (all adjusted P < 0.05), with the relative risks ranging from 1.028 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.011, 1.046) for stomach cancer to 1.201 (95% CI: 1.120, 1.308) for bone and joints cancers. Exposure-response curves showed that these associations were close to linearity, though most of them had increasing slopes at high exposure levels.

Here, we demonstrate that two multi-target natural products, cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabigerol (CBG), suppress HRPC development in the TRansgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) model by reprogramming metabolic and oncogenic signaling. Mechanistically, CBD increases glycolytic capacity and inhibits oxidative phosphorylation in enzalutamide-resistant HRPC cells. This action of CBD originates from its effect on metabolic plasticity via modulation of VDAC1 and hexokinase II (HKII) coupling on the outer mitochondrial membrane, which leads to strong shifts of mitochondrial functions and oncogenic signaling pathways. The effect of CBG on enzalutamide-resistant HRPC cells was less pronounced than CBD and only partially attributable to its action on mitochondria.

MR-Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) soft-tissue matching does not require invasive fiducial markers and enables MR-only treatments to other pelvic cancers. This study evaluated the first clinical implementation of MR-only prostate radiotherapy using MR-CBCT soft-tissue matching.  Methods:   Twenty prostate patients were treated with MR-only radiotherapy using a synthetic (s)CT-optimised plan with MR-CBCT soft-tissue matching. Two MR sequences were acquired: small Field Of View (FOV) for target delineation and large FOV for organs at risk delineation, sCT generation and on-treatment verification. Patients also received a CT for validation. The prostate was independently contoured on the small FOV MR, copied to the registered CT and modified if there were MR-CT soft-tissue alignment differences (MR-CT volume). This was compared to the MR-only volume with a paired t-test. The treatment plan was recalculated on CT and the doses compared. Independent offline CT-CBCT matches for 5/20 fractions were performed by three therapeutic radiographers using the MR-only contours and compared to the online MR-CBCT matches using two one-sided paired t-tests for equivalence within ±1 mm.  Results:   The MR-only volumes were significantly smaller than MR-CT (p = 0.003), with a volume ratio 0.92 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard error). The sCT isocentre dose difference to CT was 0.2 ± 0.1%. MR-CBCT soft-tissue matching was equivalent to CT-CBCT (p < 0.001), with differences of 0.1 ± 0.2 mm (vertical), -0.1 ± 0.2 mm (longitudinal) and 0.0 ± 0.1 mm (lateral).  Conclusions:   MR-only radiotherapy with soft-tissue matching has been successfully clinically implemented. It produced significantly smaller target volumes with high dosimetric and on-treatment matching accuracy.  Implications for practice:   MR-only prostate radiotherapy can be safely delivered without using invasive fiducial markers. This enables MR-only radiotherapy to be extended to other pelvic cancers where fiducial markers cannot be used.""","""['J J Wyatt', 'R A Pearson', 'J Frew', 'C Walker', 'N Richmond', 'M Wilkinson', 'K Wilkes', 'S Driver', 'S West', 'P Karen', 'R L Brooks-Pearson', 'D Ainslie', 'E Wilkins', 'H M McCallum']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiography (Lond)""","""['Are cone beam CT image matching skills transferrable from planning CT to planning MRI for MR-only prostate radiotherapy?', 'Cone beam computed tomography for dose calculation quality assurance for magnetic resonance-only radiotherapy.', 'The accuracy of Magnetic Resonance - Cone Beam Computed Tomography soft-tissue matching for prostate radiotherapy.', 'Accuracy of an MR-only workflow for prostate radiotherapy using semi-automatically burned-in fiducial markers.', 'Cone beam CT for QA of synthetic CT in MRI only for prostate patients.']"""

The models were applied retrospectively to the rectal wall from a cohort of prostate cancer patients. These patients had repeat CT scans evenly acquired throughout radiotherapy. Each model was used to create coverage probability matrices (CPMs). The spatial correlations between these estimated CPMs and the ground truth, derived from independent scans of the same patient, were calculated.Main results.Spatial correlation with ground truth were significantly higher for the Bayesian deformation models than both patient-specific and population-derived models with 1, 2 or 3 patient-specific scans as input. Statistical motion simulations indicate that this result will also hold for more than 3 scans.Significance.The improvement over previous models means that fewer scans per patient are needed to achieve accurate deformation predictions. The models have applications in robust radiotherapy planning and evaluation, among others.""","""['Øyvind Lunde Rørtveit', 'Liv Bolstad Hysing', 'Andreas Størksen Stordal', 'Sara Pilskog']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['A probabilistic deep learning model of inter-fraction anatomical variations in radiotherapy.', 'Incorporating organ movements in inverse planning: assessing dose uncertainties by Bayesian inference.', 'Online image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: How much improvement can we expect?

To compensate for the drawbacks of conventional SELEX, we have devised an in-silico methodology that facilitates a cost-effective and facile manner of aptamer selection. Here, we report the isolation of DNA aptamers against androgen receptors (ARs) using androgen response elements (ARE) that possess natural affinity toward AR. A virtual library of ARE sequences was prepared and subjected to a stringent selection criterion to generate a sequence pool having stable hairpin conformations and high GC content. The 3D-structures of the selected ss AREs were modeled and screened through rigid docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation to examine their potency as potential AR binders. The predicted sequences were further validated using direct enzyme-linked aptasorbent assay (ELASA), which includes the measurement of their binding affinity, specificity, and target discrimination properties under complex biological enviroments. A short, 15 nucleotides (nts), ssDNA aptamer, termed ARapt1 with the estimated Kd value of 5.5 ± 3 nm, was chosen as the most prominent aptamer against AR based on the coherence of both the in-silico and in-vitro evaluation results.

Such approaches typically aim to deliver a target dose to the IPL(s) with no deliberate effort to modulate the dose within the IPL. Prostate cancers demonstrate intra-tumor heterogeneity and hence it is hypothesized that further gains in the optimal delivery of radiation therapy can be achieved through modulation of the dose distribution within the tumor. To account for tumor heterogeneity, biologically targeted radiation therapy (BiRT) aims to utilize a voxel-wise approach to IPL dose prescription by incorporating knowledge of the spatial distribution of tumor characteristics.  Purpose:   The aim of this study was to develop a workflow for generating voxel-wise optimal dose prescriptions that maximize patient tumor control probability (TCP), and evaluate the feasibility and benefits of applying this workflow on a cohort of 62 prostate cancer patients.  Method:   The source data for this proof-of-concept study included high resolution histology images annotated with tumor location and grade. Image processing techniques were used to compute voxel-level cell density distribution maps. An absolute tumor cell distribution was calculated via linearly scaling according to published estimated tumor cell numbers. For the IPLs of each patient, optimal dose prescriptions were obtained via three alternative methods for redistribution of IPL boost doses according to maximization of TCP. The radiosensitivity uncertainties were considered using a truncated log-normally distributed linear radiosensitivity parameter ( α k ${\alpha }_k$ ) and compared with Gleason pattern (GP) dependent radiosensitivity parameters that were derived based on previously published methods. An ensemble machine learning method was implemented to identify patient-specific features that predict the TCP improvement resulting from dose redistribution relative to a uniform dose distribution.  Results:   The Gleason pattern-dependent radiosensitivity parameters were calculated for 20 published prostate cancer α / β ${{\alpha}}/{{\beta}}$ ratios. Optimal voxel-level dose prescriptions were generated for all 62 PCa patients. For all dose redistribution scenarios, the optimal dose distribution always shows a higher (or equivalent) TCP level than the uniform dose distribution. The applied random forest regressor could predict patient-specific TCP improvement with low root mean square error (≤1.5%) by using total tumor number, volume of IPLs and the standard deviation of tumor cell number among all voxels.  Conclusion:   Biologically-optimized redistribution of a boost dose can yield TCP improvement relative to a uniform-boost dose distribution. Patient-specific tumor characteristics can be used to predict the likelihood of benefit from a redistribution approach for the individual patient.""","""['Yutong Zhao', 'Annette Haworth', 'Hayley M Reynolds', 'Emily J Her', 'Yu Sun', 'Robert Finnegan', 'Pejman Rowshanfarzad', 'Martin A Ebert']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Treatment planning for prostate implants using magnetic-resonance spectroscopy imaging.', 'Prostate cancer tumour control probability modelling for external beam radiotherapy based on multi-parametric MRI-GTV definition.', 'Fitting tumor control probability models to biopsy outcome after three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy of prostate cancer: pitfalls in deducing radiobiologic parameters for tumors from clinical data.', 'Robust dose-painting-by-numbers vs. nonselective dose escalation for non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Robust treatment planning of dose painting for prostate cancer based on ADC-to-Gleason score mappings - what is the potential to increase the tumor control probability?']"""

This study examined the association of metformin use with healthcare resources utilization among diabetic, PCa patients receiving ADT.  Methods:   Diabetic adults with PCa on ADT in Hong Kong between December 1999 and March 2021 were identified. Patients with <6 months of concurrent metformin and ADT use were excluded.

However, the role of VIM‑AS1 in the proliferation and resistance to anti‑androgen therapy of LNCaP and C4‑2 prostate cancer cells remains to be determined. In the current study, gain‑and‑loss experiments were used to investigate the effects of VIM‑AS on the proliferation and anti‑androgen therapy of LNCaP and C4‑2 cells. RNA sequencing, RNA pulldown and RNA immunoprecipitation were used to elucidate the underlying mechanism of VIM‑AS1 driving prostate progression. It was demonstrated that VIM‑AS1 was upregulated in C4‑2 cells, an established castration‑resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell line, compared with in LNCaP cells, an established hormone‑sensitive prostate cancer cell line. The present study further demonstrated that VIM‑AS1 was positively associated with the clinical stage of prostate cancer. Functionally, overexpression of VIM‑AS1 decreased the sensitivity to enzalutamide treatment and enhanced the proliferation of LNCaP cells in vitro, whereas knockdown of VIM‑AS1 increased the sensitivity to enzalutamide treatment and reduced the proliferation of C4‑2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, 3‑hydroxy‑3‑methylglutaryl‑CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) was identified as one of the direct downstream targets of VIM‑AS1, and VIM‑AS1 promoted HMGCS1 expression by enhancing HMGCS1 mRNA stability through a VIM‑AS1/insulin like growth factor 2 mRNA binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2)/HMGCS1 RNA‑protein complex. Rescue assays indicated that knockdown of HMGCS1 expression ameliorated the increase in proliferation and enzalutamide resistance of prostate cancer cells induced by VIM‑AS1 overexpression. Overall, the present study determined the roles and mechanism of the VIM‑AS1/IGF2BP2/HMGCS1 axis in regulating proliferation and enzalutamide sensitivity of prostate cancer cells and suggested that VIM‑AS1 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with CRPC.""","""['Sheng-Jia Shi#', 'Dong-Hui Han#', 'Jing-Liang Zhang#', 'Yu Li', 'An-Gang Yang', 'Rui Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Combination of phospholipase Cε knockdown with GANT61 sensitizes castration‑resistant prostate cancer cells to enzalutamide by suppressing the androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Loss of a Negative Feedback Loop between IRF8 and AR Promotes Prostate Cancer Growth and Enzalutamide Resistance.', 'Understanding the mechanisms of androgen deprivation resistance in prostate cancer at the molecular level.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'lncRNA VIM-AS1 acts as a prognostic biomarker and promotes apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Our study shows that when optical absorbers are incorporated into the shell of a gaseous nanobubble, their photoacoustic signal can be significantly enhanced compared to the original form. As an example, we constructed nanobubbles using biocompatible indocyanine green (ICG) and biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). We demonstrated that these ICG nanobubbles generate a strong ultrasound signal and almost four-fold photoacoustic signal compared to the same concentration of ICG solution; our theoretical calculations corroborate this effect and elucidate the origin of the photoacoustic enhancement. To demonstrate their molecular imaging performance, we conjugated gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) targeting ligands with the ICG nanobubbles.

A patient needs to get a diagnosis of their condition as quickly as is humanly feasible in order to have the greatest chance of surviving their sickness. Skilled medical professionals use medical imaging and other traditional diagnostic methods to search for clues that may indicate the presence of malignant tendencies inside the body. Nevertheless, manual diagnosis may be time-consuming and subjective owing to the wide range of interobserver variability induced by the enormous number of medical imaging data. This variability is caused by the fact that medical imaging data are collected. Because of this, the process of accurately diagnosing a patient could become more difficult. To execute jobs that included machine learning and the interpretation of complicated imagery, cutting-edge computer technology was necessary. Since the 1980s, researchers have been working on developing a computer-aided diagnostic system that would help medical professionals in the early diagnosis of various malignancies. According to the most recent projections, prostate cancer will be discovered in the body of one out of every seven men at some time throughout the course of their life. It is unacceptable how many men are being told that they have prostate cancer, and the condition is responsible for the deaths of a rising number of men every year. Because of the high quality and multidimensionality of the MRI pictures, you will also need a powerful diagnosis system in addition to the CAD tools. Since it has been shown that CAD technology is beneficial, researchers are looking at methods to improve the accuracy, precision, and speed of the systems that use it. The effectiveness of CAD technology has been shown. This research proposes a strategy that is both effective and efficient for the processing of images and the extraction of features as well as for machine learning. This work makes use of MRI scans and machine learning in an effort to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. Histogram equalization is used while doing the preliminary processing on photographs. The image's overall quality is elevated as a result. The fuzzy C means approach is used in order to segment the images. Using a Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM), it is feasible to extract features from a dataset.

However, a subset of patients does not respond. Currently, this subgroup with bad prognosis cannot be identified before disease progression. We hypothesize that markers indicative of radioresistance, stemness and/or bone tropism may have a prognostic potential to identify patients profiting from metastases-directed radiotherapy. Therefore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were analyzed in patients with metastatic PCa (n = 24) during radiotherapy with CellSearch, multicolor flow cytometry and imaging cytometry. Analysis of copy-number alteration indicates a polyclonal CTC population that changes after radiotherapy. CTCs were found in 8 out of 24 patients (33.3%) and were associated with a shorter time to biochemical progression after radiotherapy. Whereas the total CTC count dropped after radiotherapy, a chemokine receptor CXCR4-expressing subpopulation representing 28.6% of the total CTC population remained stable up to 3 months. At once, we observed higher chemokine CCL2 plasma concentrations and proinflammatory monocytes.

The matched case-control design is commonly adopted in biomarker development studies to evaluate the discriminative power of biomarker candidates, with an intention to eliminate confounding effects. Data from matched case-control studies have been routinely analyzed by the conditional logistic regression, although the assumed logit link between biomarker combinations and disease risk may not always hold. We propose a conditional concordance-assisted learning method, which is distribution-free, for identifying an optimal combination of biomarkers to discriminate cases and controls. We are particularly interested in combinations with a clinically and practically meaningful specificity to prevent disease-free subjects from unnecessary and possibly intrusive diagnostic procedures, which is a top priority for cancer population screening. We establish asymptotic properties for the derived combination and confirm its favorable finite sample performance in simulations.

Today, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the treatment of choice in this setting, but with not negligible toxicity and low effects on local disease. Therefore, the treatment of intraprostatic PC recurrence represents a challenge for radiation oncologists. Prostate reirradiation (Re-I) might be a therapeutic possibility. We present our series of patients treated with salvage stereotactic Re‑I for intraprostatic recurrence of PC after radical radiotherapy, with the aim of evaluating feasibility and safety of linac-based prostate Re‑I.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively evaluated toxicities and outcomes of patients who underwent salvage reirradiation using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for intraprostatic PC recurrence. Inclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, histologically proven diagnosis of PC, salvage Re‑I for intraprostatic recurrence after primary radiotherapy for PC with curative intent, concurrent/adjuvant ADT with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) allowed, performance status ECOG 0-2, restaging choline/PSMA-PET/TC and prostate MRI after biochemical recurrence, and signed informed consent.  Results:   From January 2019 to April 2022, 20 patients were recruited. Median follow-up was 26.7 months (range 7-50). After SBRT, no patients were lost at follow-up and all are still alive. One- and 2‑year progression free survival (PFS) was 100% and 81.5%, respectively, while 2‑year biochemical progression-free survival (bFFS) was 88.9%. Four patients (20%) experienced locoregional lymph node progression and were treated with a further course of SBRT. Prostate reirradiation allowed the ADT start to be postponed for 12-39 months. Re‑I was well tolerated by all patients and none discontinued the treatment. No cases of ≥ G3 genitourinary (GU) or gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity were reported. Seven (35%) and 2 (10%) patients experienced acute G1 and G2 GU toxicity, respectively. Late GU toxicity was recorded in 10 (50%) patients, including 8 (40%) G1 and 2 (10%) G2. ADT-related side effects were found in 7 patients (hot flashes and asthenia).  Conclusion:   Linac-based SBRT is a safe technique for performing Re‑I for intraprostatic recurrence after primary curative radiotherapy for PC.

Possible ENRT templates were proposed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG; 2009), the PIVOTAL trialists (2015), and the NRG Oncology Group (2021). The goal of this study was to analyze the distribution of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT-positive LNs and to compare the templates regarding their LN coverage. Methods: We analyzed the PSMA PET/CT scans of 105 patients with PET-positive LNs treated with salvage ENRT from 2014 to 2019. All LNs were mapped in an exemplary dataset, classified by region, and assessed with regard to their potential coverage by the 3 ENRT templates. The primary endpoint was the number of missed LNs. The secondary endpoint was the number of patients with full coverage. To compare the templates, a t test and McNemar test were used. Results: Three hundred thirty-five LNs were contoured (3.19 per patient; 95% CI, 2.43-3.95). Most frequently, LNs were seen in the internal iliac (n = 94, 28.1%), external iliac (n = 60, 17.9%), periaortic (n = 58, 17.3%), common iliac (n = 55, 16.4%), perirectal (n = 26, 7.8%), and presacral (n = 19, 5.7%) regions. The NRG template missed fewer LNs per patient (1.01, 31.7%) than the RTOG (1.28, 40.1%, P < 0.001) and PIVOTAL templates (1.19, 37.3%, P = 0.003). No difference was observed in the number of patients with full coverage of all LNs: 52 (49.5%) with the NRG template versus 50 (47.6%) with the RTOG (P = 0.625) and 49 (46.7%) with the PIVOTAL template (P = 0.250). Conclusion: The NRG template showed better coverage than the RTOG and PIVOTAL templates. Nevertheless, in this cohort, it would have missed almost one third of all contoured LNs and would have resulted in incomplete coverage in half the patients. This result underlines the importance of advanced imaging, such as PSMA PET/CT scans, before salvage ENRT and shows the need for further individualization of ENRT fields.""","""['Christian Trapp', 'Dmytro Oliinyk', 'Paul Rogowski', 'Rieke von Bestenbostel', 'Ute Ganswindt', 'Minglun Li', 'Chukwuka Eze', 'Peter Bartenstein', 'Leonie Beyer', 'Harun Ilhan', 'Gabriel Sheikh', 'Lena Unterrainer', 'Christian Stief', 'Thilo Westhofen', 'Wolfgang G Kunz', 'Marcus Unterrainer', 'Claus Belka', 'Nina-Sophie Schmidt-Hegemann']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography-based Lymph Node Atlas for Salvage Radiotherapy in Patients with Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Validation of the New NRG Oncology 2020 guideline.', 'Nodal Oligorecurrent Prostate Cancer: Anatomic Pattern of Possible Treatment Failure in Relation to Elective Surgical and Radiotherapy Treatment Templates.', 'Outcome after PSMA-PET/CT-based salvage radiotherapy for nodal recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'The Impact of PSMA PET/CT Imaging in Prostate Cancer Radiation Treatment.']"""

Methods and materials:   Patients presenting between January 1, 2014, and September 27, 2021, at a large metropolitan hospital system were assessed for homelessness via intake screening or chart search. PEH data were cross-referenced with the institution's cancer database to identify PEH with cancer diagnoses. Demographic, clinical, and treatment variables were abstracted.  Results:   Of a total of 9654 (9250 evaluable) PEH with a median age of 42 years, 81 patients (0.88%) had at least 1 cancer diagnosis and 5 had multiple diagnoses, for a total of 87 PEH with at least 1 cancer diagnosis.

In total, 17% of patients underwent surgery alone, 13% received chemotherapy alone, 14% received RT alone, and 6% received hormone therapy alone. A total of 8% of patients underwent no treatment, and 43% underwent multimodality therapy. In total, 58% of treated patients never achieved disease-free status.

For patients who had multifraction treatment, the treatment completion rate was 85%, significantly lower than the departmental completion rate of 98% (P < .00001).  Conclusions:   In a large cohort of PEH in a metropolitan setting, cancer diagnoses were uncommon and were frequently in advanced stages. Most patients underwent single-modality treatment or no treatment at all. Despite the use of hypofractionation, the RT completion rate was low, likely reflecting complex barriers to care.

Methods:   Participants with clinical suspicion for prostate cancer (PCa) were prospectively enrolled between October 2021 and April 2022 with multiparametric prostate MRI (mpMRI) acquired on a 3 T scanner. In addition, T1 mapping was accomplished using a single-shot T1FLASH technique with inversion recovery, radial undersampling, and iterative reconstruction. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually placed on radiologically identified prostate lesions and representative reference regions of the transitional zone (TZ), benign prostate hyperplasia nodules, and peripheral zone (PZ). Mean T1 relaxation times and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values (b = 50/b = 1400 s/mm 2 ) were measured for each ROI. Participants were included in the study if they underwent ultrasound/MRI fusion-guided prostate biopsy for radiologically or clinically suspected PCa. Histological evaluation of biopsy cores served as reference standard, with grading of PCa according to the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP). ISUP grades 2 and above were considered clinically significant PCa for the scope of this study. Histological results of prostate biopsy cores were anatomically mapped to corresponding mpMRI ROIs using biopsy plans. T1 relaxation times and ADC values were compared across prostate regions and ISUP groups. Across different strata, T1 relaxation time, ADC values, and diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]) were compared using statistical methods accounting for clustered data.  Results:   Of 67 eligible participants, a total of 40 participants undergoing ultrasound/MRI fusion-guided prostate biopsy were included. Multislice T1 mapping was successfully performed in all participants at a median acquisition time of 2:10 minutes without evident image artifacts. A total of 71 prostate lesions was radiologically identified (TZ 49; PZ 22). Among those, 22 were histologically diagnosed with PCa (ISUP groups 1/2/3/4 in n = 3/15/3/1 cases, respectively). In the TZ, T1 relaxation time was statistically significantly lower for PCa compared with reference regions ( P = 0.029) and benign prostate hyperplasia nodules ( P < 0.001). Similarly, in the PZ, PCa demonstrated shorter T1 relaxation times versus reference regions ( P < 0.001). PCa also showed a trend toward shorter T1 relaxation times (median, 1.40 seconds) compared with radiologically suspicious lesions with benign histology (median, 1.47 seconds), although statistical significance was not reached ( P = 0.066). For discrimination of PCa from reference regions and benign prostate lesions, T1 relaxation times and ADC values demonstrated AUC = 0.80 and AUC = 0.83, respectively ( P = 0.519). Discriminating PCa from radiologically suspicious lesions with benign histology, T1 relaxation times and ADC values showed AUC = 0.69 and AUC = 0.62, respectively ( P = 0.446).  Conclusions:   T1FLASH-based T1 mapping yields robust results for quantification of prostate T1 relaxation time at a short examination time of 2:10 minutes without evident image artifacts. Associated T1 relaxation times could aid in discrimination of significant and nonsignificant PCa. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results in a larger patient cohort, to assess the additional benefit of T1FLASH maps in conjunction with mpMRI sequences in the setting of deep learning, and to evaluate the robustness of T1FLASH maps compared with potentially artifact-prone diffusion-weighted imaging sequences.""","""['Omar Al-Bourini', 'Ali Seif Amir Hosseini', 'Francesco Giganti', 'Julia Balz', 'Luisa Gerda Heitz', 'Dirk Voit', 'Joachim Lotz', 'Lutz Trojan', 'Jens Frahm', 'Annemarie Uhlig', 'Johannes Uhlig']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Invest Radiol""","""['T1 mapping of the prostate using Single-Shot T1FLASH and MOLLI MRI Techniques: Comparison of artifact burden and image quality.', 'Value of T2 Mapping MRI for Prostate Cancer Detection and Classification.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The value of relaxation time quantitative technique from synthetic magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and invasion assessment of prostate cancer.', 'MR fingerprinting of the prostate.']"""

Methods:   The subjects were 23 patients with 27 pathologically proven PCs who underwent 3T multiparametric MRI. With reference to the pathology findings, 2 readers in consensus identified the location of PC on multiparametric MRI and measured APT signal intensity (APT SI [%]) and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the benign region and each PC lesion.  Results:   The mean ADC showed a significant difference between benign regions and PC lesions (0.74 ± 0.15 vs 1.37 ± 0.21, P < 0.001), whereas APT SI did not ( P = 0.091). Lesion APT SI was significantly higher and lesion ADC was significantly lower in PCs with Gleason group (GG) ≥3 than in PCs with GG ≤2 (3.37 ± 1.30 vs 1.78 ± 0.67, P < 0.001, and 0.71 ± 0.18 vs 0.79 ± 0.10, P = 0.038, respectively). The APT SI was significantly higher in GG3 than in GG1, in GG3 than in GG2, and in GG4 than in GG2 ( P = 0.009, P = 0.001, and P = 0.006, respectively). The area under the curve for separating tumor lesions and benign regions was 0.601 for 3DAPT and 0.983 for ADC ( P < 0.001). The area under the curve for separating tumors with GG ≤2 from tumors with GG ≥3 was 0.912 for 3DAPT and 0.734 for ADC ( P = 0.172).  Conclusions:   In patients with PC, it might be preferable to use ADC to discriminate benign from malignant tissue and use APT SI for assessment of tumor aggressiveness.""","""['Ayumu Kido', 'Tsutomu Tamada', 'Yu Ueda', 'Mitsuru Takeuchi', 'Akihiko Kanki', 'Akira Yamamoto']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Comput Assist Tomogr""","""['Clinical impact of ultra-high b-value (3000 s/mm2) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer at 3T: comparison with b-value of 2000 s/mm2.', 'Variation of amide proton transfer signal intensity and apparent diffusion coefficient values among phases of the menstrual cycle in the normal uterus: A preliminary study.', 'Amide Proton Transfer Could Provide More Accurate Lesion Characterization in the Transition Zone of the Prostate.', 'Amide proton transfer (APT) magnetic resonance imaging of prostate cancer: comparison with Gleason scores.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

However, it is challenging to accurately segment the prostate in ultrasound images due to their low signal-to-noise ratio, the low contrast between the prostate and neighboring tissues, and the diffuse or invisible boundaries of the prostate. In this paper, we develop a novel hybrid method for segmentation of the prostate in ultrasound images that generates accurate contours of the prostate from a range of datasets. Our method involves three key steps: (1) application of a principal curve-based method to obtain a data sequence comprising data coordinates and their corresponding projection index; (2) use of the projection index as training input for a fractional-order-based neural network that increases the accuracy of results; and (3) generation of a smooth mathematical map (expressed via the parameters of the neural network) that affords a smooth prostate boundary, which represents the output of the neural network (i.e., optimized vertices) and matches the ground truth contour. Experimental evaluation of our method and several other state-of-the-art segmentation methods on datasets of prostate ultrasound images generated at multiple institutions demonstrated that our method exhibited the best capability. Furthermore, our method is robust as it can be applied to segment prostate ultrasound images obtained at multiple institutions based on various evaluation metrics.""","""['Tao Peng#', 'Yiyun Wu#', 'Jing Zhao#', 'Caishan Wang#', 'Jin Wang#', 'Jing Cai#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Digit Imaging""","""['H-ProSeg: Hybrid ultrasound prostate segmentation based on explainability-guided mathematical model.', 'Semi-Automatic Prostate Segmentation From Ultrasound Images Using Machine Learning and Principal Curve Based on Interpretable Mathematical Model Expression.', 'Automatic prostate segmentation using deep learning on clinically diverse 3D transrectal ultrasound images.', 'Ultrasound prostate segmentation based on multidirectional deeply supervised V-Net.', 'Breast ultrasound image segmentation: a survey.']"""

In addition to visual analysis, SUV was measured for semiquantitative comparison and correlation analysis.  Results:   68 Ga-P16-093 PET/CT detected more positive tumors than 68 Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT (67 vs 56, P = 0.002), especially for intraprostatic lesions (29 vs 24, P = 0.025) and lymph node metastases (23 vs 17, P = 0.034).

Methods:   The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Prostate with Watchful Waiting Database 18 Registries identified 229,428 adult men diagnosed with primary localized PCa (clinical T1-T2c, N0M0) during a median follow-up of 45 months between 2010 and 2016. Socioeconomic determinants included socioeconomic status (SES) tertiles, marital status (unmarried vs married), and residency (urban vs rural). Multivariable logistic regression and Cox models determined the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for AS/WW utilization, and adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). The extent of missing data was evaluated by multiple imputation. Sensitivity analyses were performed in multiple imputation datasets.  Results:   Unmarried patients were more likely to receive AS/WW in low-risk group (aOR, 1.20 [95%CI, 1.12-1.28]; p < 0.001) and favorable intermediate-risk group (aOR, 1.41 [95%CI, 1.26-1.59]; p < 0.001) than married patients. Urban patients had 0.77-fold lower likelihood of AS/WW than rural patients in low-risk group (95% CI, 0.68-0.87; p < 0.001), but not in favorable intermediate-risk groups.

ChIP-seq analysis showed that SMAD3 knockdown decreased global binding of AR to chromatin. Mechanistically, we show that SMAD3 binds to intron 3 of the AR gene to promote AR expression. Targeting these binding sites by CRISPRi reduced transcript levels of AR and AR targets. In addition, ∼50% of AR and SMAD3 ChIP-seq peaks overlapped, and SMAD3 may also cooperate with or co-activate AR for AR target expression. Functionally, AR re-expression in SMAD3-knockdown cells partially rescued AR target expression and cell growth defects. The SMAD3 peak in AR intron 3 overlapped with H3K27ac ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq peaks in datasets of prostate cancer.

There remains an unmet clinical need to improve how clinically significant prostate cancer is diagnosed and develop new treatments for advanced disease. Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of cancer implicated in tumour growth, metastasis, and immune evasion. One of the key drivers of aberrant glycosylation is the dysregulated expression of glycosylation enzymes within the cancer cell. Here, we demonstrate using multiple independent clinical cohorts that the glycosyltransferase enzyme GALNT7 is upregulated in prostate cancer tissue. We show GALNT7 can identify men with prostate cancer, using urine and blood samples, with improved diagnostic accuracy than serum PSA alone. We also show that GALNT7 levels remain high in progression to castrate-resistant disease, and using in vitro and in vivo models, reveal that GALNT7 promotes prostate tumour growth. Mechanistically, GALNT7 can modify O-glycosylation in prostate cancer cells and correlates with cell cycle and immune signalling pathways.

Methods:   A retrospective study was performed on multi-centers and included patients who underwent prostate biopsies and multiparametric MRI. A convolutional-neural-network-based AI model was trained and validated; the reliability of different CAD methods (concurrent read and AI-first read) were tested in an internal/external cohort. The diagnostic performance, consistency and efficiency of radiologists and AI-based CAD were compared.  Results:   The training/validation/internal test sets included 650 (400/100/150) cases from one center; the external test included 100 cases (25/25/50) from three centers. For diagnosis accuracy, AI-based CAD methods showed no significant differences and were equivalent to the radiologists in the internal test (127/150 vs. 130/150 vs. 125/150 for reader 1; 127/150 vs.132/150 vs. 131/150 for reader 2; all p > 0.05), whereas in the external test, concurrent-read methods were superior/equal to AI-first read (87/100 vs. 71/100, p < 0.001, for reader 2; 79/100 vs. 69/100, p = 0.076, for reader 1) and better than/equal to radiologists (79/100 vs. 72/100, p = 0.039, for reader 1; 87/100 vs. 86/100, p = 1.000, for reader 2).

We undertook a retrospective analysis from a prospective institutional cohort study of men who underwent radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer between 2009 and 2020, in which an index and composite grade group was reported.

Advanced techniques with altered dose distributions may have an impact on second haematological cancer (SHC) risks. We assessed SHC risk after EBRT for PCa and explored whether this risk has changed over the years.  Materials and methods:   Patients diagnosed with a T1-T3 PCa between 1990 and 2015 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients treated with EBRT were assigned to EBRT eras based on the date of diagnosis. These eras represented two-dimensional radiotherapy (2D-RT; 1991-1996), three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT; 1998-2005) or advanced EBRT (2008-2015). Standardised incidence ratios (SIR) and absolute excess risks (AER) were calculated overall and by EBRT era. Sub-hazard ratios (sHRs) were calculated for the comparison of EBRT versus radical prostatectomy and active surveillance.  Results:   PCa patients with EBRT as the primary treatment (n = 37 762) had an increased risk of developing a SHC (SIR = 1.20; 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.28) compared with the Dutch male general population. Estimated risks were highest for the 2D-RT era (SIR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval 1.14-1.67) compared with the 3D-CRT era (SIR = 1.16; 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.27) and the advanced EBRT era (SIR = 1.21; 95% confidence interval 1.07-1.36). AER were limited, with about five to six extra cases per 10 000 person-years. Relative risk analysis (EBRT versus radical prostatectomy/active surveillance) showed significant elevation with EBRT versus active surveillance (sHR = 1.17; 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.33; P = 0.017), but not for EBRT versus radical prostatectomy (sHR = 1.08; 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.23; P = 0.281).

Here, we explore the phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4K), a family of lipid kinases that regulate pools of intracellular PI, and demonstrate that the PI5P4Kα isoform influences androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which supports prostate cancer (PCa) cell survival. The regulation of PI becomes increasingly important in the setting of metabolic stress adaptation of PCa during androgen deprivation (AD), as we show that AD influences PI abundance and enhances intracellular pools of PI-4,5-P2. We suggest that this PI5P4Kα-AR relationship is mitigated through mTORC1 dysregulation and show that PI5P4Kα colocalizes to the lysosome, the intracellular site of mTORC1 complex activation. Notably, this relationship becomes prominent in mouse prostate tissue following surgical castration.

Objective:   To evaluate the effect of focal vs extended IRE on early oncological control for patients with localized low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this randomized clinical trial conducted at 5 centers in Europe, men with localized low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer were randomized to receive either focal or extended IRE ablation. Data were collected at baseline and at regular intervals after the procedure from June 2015 to January 2020, and data were analyzed from September 2021 to July 2022.  Main outcomes and measures:   Oncological outcome as indicated by presence of clinically significant prostate cancer (International Society of Urological Pathology grade ≥2) on transperineal template-mapping prostate biopsy at 6 months after IRE. Descriptive measures of results from that biopsy included the number and location of positive cores.  Results:   A total of 51 and 55 patients underwent focal and extended IRE, respectively. Median (IQR) age was 64 years (58-67) in the focal ablation group and 64 years (57-68) in the extended ablation group. Median (IQR) follow-up time was 30 months (24-48). Clinically significant prostate cancer was detected in 9 patients (18.8%) in the focal ablation group and 7 patients (13.2%) in the extended ablation group. There was no significant difference in presence of clinically significant prostate cancer between the 2 groups. In the focal ablation group, 17 patients (35.4%) had positive cores outside of the treated area, 3 patients (6.3%) had positive cores in the treated area, and 5 patients (10.4%) had positive cores both in and outside of the treated area. In the extended group, 10 patients (18.9%) had positive cores outside of the treated area, 9 patients (17.0%) had positive cores in the treated area, and 2 patients (3.8%) had positive cores both in and outside of the treated area. Clinically significant cancer was found in the treated area in 5 of 48 patients (10.4%) in the focal ablation group and 5 of 53 patients (9.4%) in the extended ablation group.  Conclusions and relevance:   This study found that focal and extended IRE ablation achieved similar oncological outcomes in men with localized low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

Methods:   Two design variants of the drop-in gamma probe (SENSEI; Lightpoint Medical Ltd) were assessed in the pelvic phantom, and the preferred design was evaluated in a porcine model with clinically representative volumes and 99mTc activities. In the clinical trial, radical prostatectomy, SLND, and extended pelvic lymph node dissection were performed the day after 99mTc-nanocolloid injection and imaging. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were detected with the drop-in probe and a rigid laparoscopic gamma probe (RLGP). An interim analysis was performed after 10 patients were recruited.  Results:   The narrow field of view probe design outperformed the wide field of view design in the pelvic phantom (detection rate, 100% vs 50%). In the porcine model, all activity concentrations could be successfully detected. The drop-in gamma probe successfully detected SLNs in all 10 patients (detection rate, 100%). Two of the SLNs identified by the drop-in gamma probe could not be found with the RLGP. No false-negative cases and no adverse events related to the SLND procedure or the drop-in gamma probe occurred.  Conclusion:   The drop-in gamma probe meets the usability and performance requirements for SLND in PCa and provides performance advantages over the RLGP.

We aimed to provide concordance rates using the PSMA reporting and data system (RADS) for scan interpretation and also determine whether such agreement rates are affected by available patient characteristics at time of scan.  Patients and methods:   Sixty men with PC, who all underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, were included. Three independent, experienced readers indicated general scan parameters (including overall scan result, organ or lymph node [LN] involvement, and appropriateness of radioligand therapy). Applying PSMA-RADS 1.0, observers also had to conduct RADS scoring on a target lesion (TL) and overall scan level. During the first read, observers were masked to all relevant clinical information, whereas on a second read, relevant patient characteristics were displayed, thereby allowing for determination of impact of available clinical information for scan interpretation. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]), which were then rated according to Cicchetti (0.4-0.59 fair, 0.6-0.74 good, and 0.75-1 excellent agreement).  Results:   For general parameters, agreement rates were excellent, including an overall scan result (ICC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90), LN metastases (ICC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93), organ involvement (ICC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89), and indication for radioligand therapy (ICC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96). Overall RADS scoring was also excellent with an ICC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.96-09.4). On a TL-based level, 251 different lesions were selected by the 3 observers (with 73 chosen by all 3 readers). RADS-based concordance rates were fair to excellent: all lesions, ICC of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.85); LN, ICC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.63-0.92); skeleton, ICC of 0.55 (95% CI, 0-0.84); and prostate, ICC of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.17-0.78). When performing a second read displaying patient's characteristics, there were only minor modifications to the previously applied RADS scoring on a TL-based level (overall, n = 8): each reader 1 and 2 in 3/60 (5%) instances, and reader 3 in 2/60 (3.3%) instances. The main reason for recategorization (mainly upstaging) was provided information on PSA levels (4/8, 50%).  Conclusions:   Applying PSMA-RADS, concordance rates were fair to excellent, whereas relevant modifications were rarely observed after providing clinical data. As such, even in the absence of patient information, standardized frameworks still provide guidance for reading PSMA PETs. Those findings may have implications for a high throughput in a busy PET practice, where patient details cannot always be retrieved at time of scan interpretation or in the context of clinical trials or central reviews in which readers may be blinded to clinical data.""","""['Ralph A Bundschuh', 'Susanne Lütje', 'Lena Bundschuh', 'Constantin Lapa', 'Takahiro Higuchi', 'Philipp E Hartrampf', 'Michael A Gorin', 'Aleksander Kosmala', 'Andreas K Buck', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Markus Essler', 'Gabriel T Sheikh', 'Rudolf A Werner']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['Interobserver Agreement for the Standardized Reporting System PSMA-RADS 1.0 on 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT Imaging.', 'Interobserver Agreement Rates on C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4-Directed Molecular Imaging and Therapy.', 'High Interobserver Agreement for the Standardized Reporting System SSTR-RADS 1.0 on Somatostatin Receptor PET/CT.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

We evaluated relationships between race, neighborhood social disadvantage, and cancer survival.  Methods:   We calculated overall and cancer-specific survival for 11,367 non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and 29,481 non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer using data from the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System. The area deprivation index (ADI) was used to measure social disadvantage at the census block group level, where higher ADI is associated with poorer neighborhood factors. Associations between ADI and survival were estimated using Cox proportional hazards mixed-effects models accounting for geographic grouping and adjusting for demographic and clinical factors.  Results:   Increasing ADI quintile was associated with increased overall mortality for all four cancer sites in multivariable-adjusted models. Stratified by race, these associations remained among breast (NHW: HR = 1.16, P < 0.0001; NHB: HR = 1.20, P < 0.0001), colorectal (NHW: HR = 1.11, P < 0.0001; NHB: HR = 1.09, P = 0.00378), prostate (NHW: HR = 1.18, P < 0.0001; NHB: HR = 1.18, P < 0.0001), and lung cancers (NHW: HR = 1.06, P < 0.0001; NHB: HR = 1.07, P = 0.00177). Cancer-specific mortality estimates were similar to overall mortality. Adjustment for ADI substantially attenuated the effects of race on mortality for breast [overall proportion attenuated (OPA) = 47%, P < 0.0001; cancer-specific proportion attenuated (CSPA) = 37%, P < 0.0001] prostate cancer (OPA = 51%, P < 0.0001; CSPA = 56%, P < 0.0001), and colorectal cancer (OPA = 69%, P = 0.032; CSPA = 36%, P = 0.018).

We evaluated how choice of survival metric influences assessment of cancer survival among American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) people relative to non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). A secondary objective was to present variations in survival among AIAN people by age, sex, stage, and Indian Health Service (IHS) region.  Methods:   Five-year survival was calculated using the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries Cancer in North America dataset. We calculated survival among AIAN people, compared with NHW using four approaches: (i) observed (crude) survival, (ii) cause-specific survival, (iii) relative survival using age- and sex-adjusted lifetables, and (iv) relative survival using lifetables additionally adjusted for race, geography, and socioeconomic status. For AIAN people, we evaluated how survival varied by age, stage at diagnosis, and IHS region.  Results:   Observed survival methods produced the lowest estimates, and-excepting prostate cancer-cause-specific methods produced the highest survival estimates. Survival was lower among AIAN people than NHW for all methods. Among AIAN people, survival was higher among those 20-64 years, females, and tumors diagnosed at local stage. Survival varied by IHS region and cancer sites.  Conclusions:   These results support the assertion that using the same methodology to compare survival estimates between racial and ethnic groups is of paramount importance, but that the choice of metric requires careful consideration of study objectives.

Results:   Our results indicated that DLC1 overexpression markedly suppressed the proliferation and cell cycle progression of LNCaP cells. Moreover, DLC1 expression was negatively correlated with Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) expression in LNCaP cells.

Therefore, delivering oligonucleotides (siRNA/miRNA) that target specific genes or gene programs might have a potential therapeutic benefit. The aim of this study was to examine the potential of cell-based delivery of oligonucleotides to cancer cells via two naturally occurring intercellular pathways: gap junctions and vesicular/exosomal traffic. We utilized human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) as delivery cells and chose to deliver in vitro two synthetic oligonucleotides, AllStars HS Cell Death siRNA and miR-16 mimic, as toxic (therapeutic) oligonucleotides targeting three cancer cell lines: prostate (PC3), pancreatic (PANC1) and cervical (HeLa). Both oligonucleotides dramatically reduced cell proliferation and/or induced cell death when transfected directly into target cells and delivery hMSCs. The delivery and target cells we chose express gap junction connexin 43 (Cx43) endogenously (PC3, PANC1, hMSC) or via stable transfection (HeLaCx43). Co-culture of hMSCs (transfected with either toxic oligonucleotide) with any of Cx43 expressing cancer cells induced target cell death (~20% surviving) or senescence (~85% proliferation reduction) over 96 hours. We eliminated gap junction-mediated delivery by using connexin deficient HeLaWT cells or knocking out endogenous Cx43 in PANC1 and PC3 cells via CRISPR/Cas9. Subsequently, all Cx43 deficient target cells co-cultured with the same toxic oligonucleotide loaded hMSCs proliferated, albeit at significantly slower rates, with cell number increasing on average ~2.2-fold (30% of control cells) over 96 hours. Our results show that both gap junction and vesicular/exosomal intercellular delivery pathways from hMSCs to target cancer cells deliver oligonucleotides and function to either induce cell death or significantly reduce their proliferation. Thus, hMSC-based cellular delivery is an effective method of delivering synthetic oligonucleotides that can significantly reduce tumor cell growth and should be further investigated as a possible approach to cancer therapy.""","""['Virginijus Valiunas', 'Chris Gordon', 'Laima Valiuniene', 'Daniel Devine', 'Richard Z Lin', 'Ira S Cohen', 'Peter R Brink']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Drug Deliv Sci Technol""","""['A comparison of two cellular delivery mechanisms for small interfering RNA.', 'Connexin-specific cell-to-cell transfer of short interfering RNA by gap junctions.', 'Connexin43 Mediated Delivery of ADAMTS5 Targeting siRNAs from Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Synovial Fibroblasts.', 'Connexin 43 (Cx43) in cancer: Implications for therapeutic approaches via gap junctions.', ""Gap junction connexins in female reproductive organs: implications for women's reproductive health.""]"""

The progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analyses.  Results:   Patients with SM (n = 26) had significantly higher biopsy Gleason scores, higher clinical T stage, higher prostate-specific antigen level at diagnosis, and were more likely to have high-burden metastasis and lymph node metastasis, compared with those without SM (n = 81). They also showed significantly lower level of hemoglobin, albumin and serum calcium, along with higher level of alkaline phosphatase. SM was significantly associated with shorter medium PFS (9.4 vs. 18.3 months, p < 0.001) and OS (22.2 vs. 58.2 months, p < 0.001). Cox analysis demonstrated that SM was an independent risk factor for shorter PFS (hazard ratio 2.327 [1.429-3.789], p = 0.001) and shorter OS (hazard ratio 2.810 [1.615-4.899], p < 0.001).

When PCa metastasizes to the bone, the new microenvironment can induce the epigenome reprogramming and stemness remodeling of cancer cells, thereby increasing the adaptability of cancer cells to the bone microenvironment, and this even leads to the occurrence of secondary tumor metastasis. Our group has previously found that RNA binding motif 3 (RBM3) affects the stem cell-like properties of PCa by interfering with alternative splicing of CD44. However, whether RBM3, as a stress-response protein, can resist microenvironmental remodeling of PCa particularly in bone metastasis remains unknown. By co-culturing PCa cells with osteoblasts to mimic PCa bone metastases, we found that RBM3 upregulates the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation on the mRNA of catenin beta 1 (CTNNB1) in a manner dependent on methyltransferase 3 (METTL3), an N6-adenosine-methyltransferase complex catalytic subunit. Consequently, this modification results in a decreased stability of CTNNB1 mRNA and a followed inactivation of Wnt signaling, which ultimately inhibits the stemness remodeling of PCa cells by osteoblasts. Thus, the present study may extend our understanding of the inhibitory role of RBM3 on particularly bone metastasis of PCa.""","""['Shouyi Zhang', 'Chengcheng Lv', 'Yichen Niu', 'Changqi Li', 'Xiuming Li', 'Yu Shang', 'Yunchao Zhang', 'Yue Zhang', 'Yong Zhang', 'Yu Zeng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['YTHDF2 mediates the mRNA degradation of the tumor suppressors to induce AKT phosphorylation in N6-methyladenosine-dependent way in prostate cancer.', 'Silencing of METTL3 effectively hinders invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.', 'Stress-response protein RBM3 attenuates the stem-like properties of prostate cancer cells by interfering with CD44 variant splicing.', 'Multifaceted Roles of the N6-Methyladenosine RNA Methyltransferase METTL3 in Cancer and Immune Microenvironment.', 'One Stone, Two Birds: N6-Methyladenosine RNA Modification in Leukemia Stem Cells and the Tumor Immune Microenvironment in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.', 'Epigenetic Modifications in Prostate Cancer Metastasis and Microenvironment.', 'The m6A methylation landscape, molecular characterization and clinical relevance in prostate adenocarcinoma.']"""

The current study identified that the macrophage is the major microenvironmental component of bone-metastatic PC in patients. Using a novel in vivo model, we demonstrated that macrophages were critical for enzalutamide resistance through induction of a wound-healing-like response of ECM-receptor gene expression. Mechanistically, macrophages drove resistance through cytokine activin A that induced fibronectin (FN1)-integrin alpha 5 (ITGA5)-tyrosine kinase Src (SRC) signaling cascade in PC cells. This novel mechanism was strongly supported by bioinformatics analysis of patient transcriptomics datasets.

We compared the risk of suicide in prostate cancer patients to cancer-free men including adjustment for clinical stage, socioeconomic position, somatic comorbidity, and previous depression.  Materials and methods:   A cohort of 37,527 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Denmark during 1998-2011 was identified in the Danish Prostate Cancer Registry (DaPCaR) and compared with 357,384 cancer-free men matched by age at the time of diagnosis. The primary outcome was death from suicide. Data were analyzed using cumulative incidence functions and multivariable Cox regression models.  Results:   Among prostate cancer patients, 3813 had a previous depression, defined as filed antidepressant prescription within three years before diagnosis. In the study period, 108 prostate cancer patients were registered with suicide as the cause of death, hereof 26 with previous depression. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of suicide between prostate cancer patients and cancer-free men. There was no effect modification of previous depression on the risk of suicide (p = .12). The hazard ratio (HR) for suicide varied with time since diagnosis. A sensitivity analysis showed that the risk of suicide was highest within the first year of diagnosis where prostate cancer patients had a 1.70-fold increased hazard compared with cancer-free men (95% CI, 1.11-2.59). Men with prostate cancer and previous depression had a three-fold increased hazard for suicide compared with prostate cancer patients without a history of depression (HR 2.84, 95% CI, 1.82-4.45).

Using a cohort of prostate cancer brain metastases (PCBM) from 42 patients, with matched primary tumors for 17 patients, we carried out a DNA methylation analysis to examine the epigenetic distinction between primary prostate cancer and PCBM, the association between epigenetic alterations and mutational background, and particular epigenetic alterations that may be associated with PCBM. Multiregion sampling of PCBM revealed epigenetic stability within metastases. Aberrant methylation in PCBM was associated with mutational background and PRC2 complex activity, an effect that is particularly pronounced in SPOP-mutant PCBM. While PCBM displayed a CpG island hypermethylator phenotype, hypomethylation at the promoters of genes involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and cell adhesion molecules such as GABRB3, CLDN8, and CLDN4 was also observed, suggesting that cells from primary tumors may require specific reprogramming to form brain metastasis.

The backbone of prostate cancer care is gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) therapy, commonly administered every month or 3 months. We estimated the cost and capacity savings associated with increased use of 6-monthly GnRHa therapy in England.  Methods:   A capacity and cost-minimization model including a societal perspective was developed (in Microsoft Excel) to generate cost and capacity estimates for GnRHa drug acquisition and administration for ""Current practice"" and for a ""Base case"" scenario. In the ""Base case"" scenario, 50% of patients who were receiving monthly or 3-monthly GnRHa therapy in ""Current practice"" switched/transitioned to a 6-monthly formulation. Cost/capacity estimates were calculated per patient per administration and scaled to annualized population levels. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of individual model assumptions: 1 tested the impact of drug acquisition costs; 2 and 3 tested the level of nurse grade and the time associated with treatment administration, respectively; 4 tested the rate of switch/transition to 6-monthly GnRHa therapy; and 5 tested differing diagnostic patterns following the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.  Results:   Compared with ""Current practice"", the ""Base case"" scenario was associated with annual cost savings of £5,164,296 (148,478 fewer appointments/year and 37,119 fewer appointment-hours/year). The largest savings were in drug administration (£2.2 million) and acquisition (£1.6 million) costs. Annual societal cost savings totaled £1.4 million, mainly in reduced appointment-related travel, productivity and leisure time opportunity losses. Increased use of 6-monthly versus monthly or 3-monthly GnRHa therapy consistently achieved system-wide annual cost and capacity savings across all sensitivity analysis scenarios.  Conclusions:   Our holistic model suggests that switching/transitioning men from monthly or 3- monthly GnRHa therapy to a 6-monthly formulation can reduce NHS cost and capacity pressures and the societal and environmental costs associated with prostate cancer care.""","""['Philip Cornford', 'Caolan Halpin', 'Jelena Sassmann', 'Ian Frankcom', 'Saran Braybrook']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Med Econ""","""['A full economic evaluation of extensive vaccination against rotavirus with RIX4414 vaccine at National and Regional level in Italy.', 'Risk-based, 6-monthly and 24-monthly dental check-ups for adults: the INTERVAL three-arm RCT.', 'Healthcare and wider societal implications of stillbirth: a population-based cost-of-illness study.', 'Cost-effectiveness analysis of schizophrenic patient care settings: impact of an atypical antipsychotic under long-acting injection formulation.', 'The Economic Impact of Smoking and of Reducing Smoking Prevalence: Review of Evidence.']"""

However, it has only moderate sensitivity for predicting histopathological tumour progression at follow-up, which is in part due to the subjective nature of its clinical reporting and variation among centres and readers. In this study, we used a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to develop a time series radiomics (TSR) predictive model that analysed longitudinal changes in tumour-derived radiomic features across 297 scans from 76 AS patients, 28 with histopathological PCa progression and 48 with stable disease. Using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), we found that an LSTM-based model combining TSR and serial PSA density (AUC 0.86 [95% CI: 0.78-0.94]) significantly outperformed a model combining conventional delta-radiomics and delta-PSA density (0.75 [0.64-0.87]; p = 0.048) and achieved comparable performance to expert-performed serial MRI analysis using the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation (PRECISE) scoring system (0.84 [0.76-0.93]; p = 0.710). The proposed TSR framework, therefore, offers a feasible quantitative tool for standardising serial MRI assessment in PCa AS. It also presents a novel methodological approach to serial image analysis that can be used to support clinical decision-making in multiple scenarios, from continuous disease monitoring to treatment response evaluation. KEY POINTS: •LSTM RNN can be used to predict the outcome of PCa AS using time series changes in tumour-derived radiomic features and PSA density. •Using all available TSR features and serial PSA density yields a significantly better predictive performance compared to using just two time points within the delta-radiomics framework. •The concept of TSR can be applied to other clinical scenarios involving serial imaging, setting out a new field in AI-driven radiology research.""","""['Nikita Sushentsev', 'Leonardo Rundo', 'Luis Abrego', 'Zonglun Li', 'Tatiana Nazarenko', 'Anne Y Warren', 'Vincent J Gnanapragasam', 'Evis Sala', 'Alexey Zaikin', 'Tristan Barrett#', 'Oleg Blyuss#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Radiol""","""['Commentary: considering radiomics in the setting of prostate cancer active surveillance.', 'Comparative performance of MRI-derived PRECISE scores and delta-radiomics models for the prediction of prostate cancer progression in patients on active surveillance.', 'Reliability of Serial Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging to Detect Prostate Cancer Progression During Active Surveillance: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'MRI-derived radiomics model for baseline prediction of prostate cancer progression on active surveillance.', 'Changes in Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using the Prostate Cancer Radiologic Estimation of Change in Sequential Evaluation Criteria to Detect Prostate Cancer Progression for Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Deep Learning for Medical Image-Based Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Using deep learning-derived image features in radiologic time series to make personalised predictions: proof of concept in colonic transit data.', 'Using a Recurrent Neural Network To Inform the Use of Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA) and PSA Density for Dynamic Monitoring of the Risk of Prostate Cancer Progression on Active Surveillance.']"""

Methods:   This descriptive study included 273 patients and their partners (dyads) who transitioned from PCa treatment to self-management. We used established, psychometrically sound measures to assess health outcomes and psychosocial factors and conducted multilevel modeling analyses.  Results:   Compared to partners, patients reported worse physical QOL; less frequent anxiety; less pain and fatigue; less bothersome hormonal problems; more bothersome urinary and sexual problems; greater self-efficacy; and more instrumental support. Compared to their white counterparts, non-white dyads reported better overall, emotional, and functional QOL; less depression; more positive appraisals, and greater self-efficacy. Compared to dyads in low ADI neighborhoods, dyads in high ADI (more deprived) neighborhoods reported worse social QOL; more bothersome urinary, sexual, and hormonal symptoms; and less interpersonal support. White patients reported the highest emotional support among all groups, while white partners reported the lowest emotional support.  Conclusion:   Our findings underscore the need to consider social determinants of health at multiple levels when investigating PCa disparities. Considering neighborhood-level socioeconomic factors, in addition to race and role, improves our understanding of the PCa disparities in QOL, symptoms, and psychosocial factors among patients and partners.

In addition, the diagnostic abilities and expertise of pathologists is dependent on their direct experience with common and rarer variant morphologies. Recently, deep learning approaches have been used to successfully show a high level of accuracy for such tasks. However, obtaining expert-level annotated images is an expensive and time-consuming task, and artificially synthesized histologic images can prove greatly beneficial. In this study, we present an approach to not only generate histologic images that reproduce the diagnostic morphologic features of common disease but also provide a user ability to generate new and rare morphologies. Our approach involves developing a generative adversarial network model that synthesizes pathology images constrained by class labels. We investigated the ability of this framework in synthesizing realistic prostate and colon tissue images and assessed the utility of these images in augmenting the diagnostic ability of machine learning methods and their usability by a panel of experienced anatomic pathologists. Synthetic data generated by our framework performed similar to real data when training a deep learning model for diagnosis. Pathologists were not able to distinguish between real and synthetic images, and their analyses showed a similar level of interobserver agreement for prostate cancer grading. We extended the approach to significantly more complex images from colon biopsies and showed that the morphology of the complex microenvironment in such tissues can be reproduced. Finally, we present the ability for a user to generate deepfake histologic images using a simple markup of sematic labels.""","""['Kianoush Falahkheirkhah', 'Saumya Tiwari', 'Kevin Yeh', 'Sounak Gupta', 'Loren Herrera-Hernandez', 'Michael R McCarthy', 'Rafael E Jimenez', 'John C Cheville', 'Rohit Bhargava']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Digital Biopsy with Fluorescence Confocal Microscope for Effective Real-time Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective, Comparative Study.', 'Bridging the gap between prostate radiology and pathology through machine learning.', 'Use of Deep Learning to Develop and Analyze Computational Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining of Prostate Core Biopsy Images for Tumor Diagnosis.', 'A Hybrid Human-Machine Learning Approach for Screening Prostate Biopsies Can Improve Clinical Efficiency Without Compromising Diagnostic Accuracy.', 'Utility of whole slide imaging and virtual microscopy in prostate pathology.', 'Digital Histopathology by Infrared Spectroscopic Imaging.']"""

Objective:   To evaluate International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) concordance rates between the final pathology at RP and MRI-TBx or MRI-TBx + random biopsy (RB) according to the biopsy approach.  Design, setting, and participants:   A multi-institutional database included patients diagnosed with TP or TR treated with RP.  Intervention:   TP-TBx or TR-TBx of the prostate.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The ISUP grade at biopsy was compared with the final pathology. A multivariable logistic regression analysis (MVA) was performed to assess the association between the biopsy approach (TP-TBx vs TR-TBx) and ISUP upgrading, downgrading, concordance, and clinically relevant increase (CRI).  Results and limitations:   Overall, 752 (59%) versus 530 (41%) patients underwent TR versus TP. At the MVA, TP-TBx was an independent predictor of upgrading (odds ratio [OR] 0.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.4-0.9, p < 0.01) and improved concordance relative to the final pathology (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.5, p < 0.01) after adjusting for age, cT stage, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, number of targeted cores, prostate-specific antigen, and prostate volume. Moreover, TP-TBx was associated with a lower risk of CRI than TR-TBx (OR 0.7, p < 0.01). This held true when considering patients who underwent MRI-TBx + RB (OR 0.6, p < 0.01). The inclusion of men who had RP represents a potential selection bias.  Conclusions:   The adoption of TP-TBx compared with TR-TBx may reduce the risk of upgrading and improve the concordance of biopsy grade with the final pathology. The TP approach decreases the odds of CRI with improved patient selection for the correct active treatment.  Patient summary:   In this report, we evaluated whether transperineal (TP) targeted biopsy (TBx) may improve the concordance of clinically significant prostate cancer with the final pathology in comparison with transrectal (TR) TBx in a large worldwide population. We found that TP-TBx might increase concordance compared with TR-TBx. Adding random biopsies to target one increases accuracy; however, concordance with the final pathology is overall suboptimal even with the TP approach.""","""['Fabio Zattoni', 'Giancarlo Marra', 'Alberto Martini', 'Veeru Kasivisvanathan', 'Jeremy Grummet', 'Timothy Harkin', 'Guillaume Ploussard', 'Jonathan Olivier', 'Peter K Chiu', 'Massimo Valerio', 'Alessandro Marquis', 'Paolo Gontero', 'Hongqian Guo', 'Junlong Zhuang', 'Mark Frydenberg', 'Daniel Moon', 'Alessandro Morlacco', 'Alexander Kretschmer', 'Francesco Barletta', 'Isabel Heidegger', 'Derya Tilki', 'Roderick van den Bergh', 'Fabrizio Dal Moro', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Francesco Montorsi', 'Giacomo Novara', 'Giorgio Gandaglia;EAU-YAU Prostate Cancer Working Party']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Focus""","""['The Detection of Prostate Cancer with Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Targeted Prostate Biopsies is Superior with the Transperineal vs the Transrectal Approach.

Despite this widespread burden in the African continent, little is known about the perspectives and experience of prostate cancer among African men. To further understand experiences among patients living in urban South Africa, we conducted in-depth, semi-structured qualitative interviews to examine the perceptions and experiences of 28 Black African prostate cancer patients receiving treatment at a major tertiary hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa. Our data explored four major areas of patients' experiences with prostate cancer: detection, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care. Our results showed that the experience of living with prostate cancer among low-income, Black South African men is a stressful and emotionally painful experience due in part to men feeling that they had insufficient knowledge about their own condition and feeling disempowered or ill-equipped to manage their cancer. These feelings were strongly associated with distrust or dissatisfaction with physicians and the health care system.

The majority of experiences have been collected for PSMA-PET-imaging of recurrent PC. Data for primary staging of high-risk PC are highly promising. Meanwhile, a plethora of PSMA-ligands are available for clinical use (e. g. 68Ga-PSMA-11, 68Ga-PSMA-I&T, 68Ga-PSMA-617, 18F-DCFBC, 18F-DCFPyL, 18F-PSMA-1007, 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 18F-JK-PSMA-7). However, an official approval is available only for 68Ga-PSMA-11 (approved by the US FDA in 2020) and 18F-DCFPyL (approved by the US FDA in 2021).Recommendations for acquisition times vary from 1-2 h p. i. It has been shown that for the majority of tumour lesions, the contrast in PSMA-PET/CT increases with time. Therefore, additional late imaging can help to clarify unclear findings. PSMA-PET/CT should be performed prior to commencing an androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) since (long term) ADT reduces the visibility of PC lesions. Following injection of PSMA-ligands, hydration and forced diuresis are recommended for PSMA-ligands with primarily excretion via the kidneys in order to increase the visibility of tumour lesions adjacent to the urinary bladder.PSMA-ligands are physiologically taken up in multiple normal organs. For some 18F-labelled PSMA-ligands, presence of unspecific focal bone uptake has been reported. When using these tracers, focal bone uptake without CT-correlate should be interpreted with great caution. Besides prostate cancer, practically all solid tumors express PSMA in their neovasculature thereby taking up PSMA-ligands, although usually at a lower extent compared to PC. Also multiple benign lesions and inflammatory processes (e. g. lymph nodes) take up PSMA-ligands, also usually at lower extent compared to PC.""","""['Ali Afshar-Oromieh', 'Matthias Eiber', 'Wolfgang Fendler', 'Matthias Schmidt', 'Kambiz Rahbar', 'Hojjat Ahmadzadehfar', 'Lale Umutlu', 'Boris Hadaschik', 'Oliver W Hakenberg', 'Paolo Fornara', 'Jens Kurth', 'O Neels', 'Hans-Jürgen Wester', 'Markus Schwaiger', 'Klaus Kopka', 'Uwe Haberkorn', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Bernd J Krause;Deutsche Gesellschaft für Urologie e.\u200aV.

The BRAF V595E mutation, corresponding to the human BRAF V600E mutation, is found frequently in cPCa. Activating BRAF mutations are recognized as oncogenic drivers, and blockade of MAPK/ERK phosphorylation may be an effective therapeutic target against BRAF-mutated tumours. The aim of this study was to establish a novel cPCa cell line and to clarify the antitumor effects of MEK inhibitors on cPCa in vitro and in vivo. We established the novel CHP-2 cPCa cell line that was derived from the prostatic tissue of a cPCa patient. Sequencing of the canine BRAF gene in two cPCa cell lines revealed the presence of the BRAF V595E mutation. MEK inhibitors (trametinib, cobimetinib and mirdametinib) strongly suppressed cell proliferation in vitro, and trametinib showed the highest efficacy against cPCa cells with minimal cytotoxicity to non-cancer COPK cells. Furthermore, we orally administered 0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg trametinib to CHP-2 xenografted mice and examined its antitumor effects in vivo. Trametinib reduced tumour volume, decreased phosphorylated ERK levels, and lowered Ki-67 expression in xenografts in a dose-dependent manner. Although no clear adverse events were observed with administration, trametinib-treated xenografts showed osteogenesis that was independent of dosage. Our results indicate that trametinib induces cell cycle arrest by inhibiting ERK activation, resulting in cPCa tumour regression in a dose-dependent manner.

Methods:   Eligible patients included males with stage ≤T3b localized disease, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≤50 , International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≤14, and a gland volume ≤70 cm3. Patients underwent perirectal spacer placement, followed by a planning MRI and were subsequently treated with SBRT doses of 36.25 Gy in five fractions to the whole prostate while simultaneously escalating doses to the magnetic resonance image visible DIN up to 50 Gy.

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening remains a practical method of screening for and thereby detecting PCa early, especially among African men who are more negatively affected. Modifiable risk factors for PCa are mostly behavioural and lifestyle. Understanding community-specific determinants is important when developing health promotion interventions.  Objective:   This study aimed to determine the profile of African men with PCa in the Free State, South Africa.  Method:   A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using case record information and self-administered questionnaires among 341 African men with PCa attending the oncology and urology clinics of a tertiary hospital.  Result:   Participants' median age at diagnosis was 66 years. Only 76 (22.3%) participants had ever heard of PCa prior to being diagnosed with the disease, 36 (47.4%) of whom had ever had screening performed. The majority (n = 298, 87.4%) were symptomatic; 50% sought medical help within six months. At diagnosis, 133 (39.0%) men presented with stage T3 or T4 disease, 75 (22.0%) with metastatic disease and 84 (24.6%) with Gleason score ≥ 8. Factors associated with advanced and high-grade disease included smoking, decreased sunlight exposure and physical activity, relatively increased ingestion of dairy products and red meat. Factors associated with early stage and low-grade disease included relatively increased ingestion of fruits, vegetables and fish.  Conclusion:   Advanced and high-grade PCa disease is not uncommon among men ≥ 60 years in this study setting. Certain modifiable risk factors associated with advanced disease were established in this study. The majority had lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) prior to PCa diagnosis, but they were of poor health-seeking behaviour.

The study aimed to evaluate the potential of TQB3720 in promoting ferroptosis to suppress prostate cancer, providing a theoretical basis for PCa therapy. Methods: PCa cells and nude mice models were divided into TQB3720, enzalutamide (ENZ), and control groups. Sulforhodamine B assay, colony formation assessment, organoids culture system, and the CCK8 assay were used for detecting proliferation. Western blot assay was processed to detect the expression of androgen receptor (AR), ferroptosis, and apoptosis-related genes. Flow cytometry was applied to measure the intracellular ROS levels. ELISA was performed to determine the cellular oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. RT-qPCR was conducted to detect the mRNA expression of genes in AR signaling. BODIPYTM™ 581/591 was processed for detection of intracellular lipid peroxidation levels. The interaction of AR with other translational factor complex proteins was explored using Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), and the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to detect the binding of AR-involved translational complex to downstream genes promoter. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to examine the translation activity of GPX4 promoter, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to analyze the levels of c-MYC, Ki-67 and AR in TQB3720-treated cancer tissues. Results: Here, we found TQB3720 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. TQB3720 treatment induced intracellular levels of GSSG and MDA significantly, by which hints AR antagonist caused ferroptosis-related cell death. Moreover, molecular evidence shown TQB3720 regulates downstream of AR signaling by binding AR resulting in inhibition of AR entry into the nucleus. Additional, we also proved that TQB3720 abrogates the interaction between AR and SP1 and leads to decrease GPX4 transcription. Conclusion: TQB3720 promotes ferroptosis in prostate cancer cells by reducing the AR/SP1 transcriptional complex binding to GPX4 promoter.

Methods:   LNCaP tumor-bearing NOD-Rag1nullIL2rgnull (NRG) mice were treated with an intraveinous single-dose of 64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA at maximal tolerated injected activity, natCu-DOTHA2-PSMA at equimolar amount (control) or lutetium-177 (177Lu)-PSMA-617 at 120 MBq to assess their impact on survival. Weight, well-being and tumor size were followed until mice reached 62 days post-injection or ethical limits. Toxicity was assessed through weight, red blood cells (RBCs) counts, pathology and dosimetry calculations.  Results:   Survival was longer with 64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA than with natCu-DOTHA2-PSMA (p < 0.001). Likewise, survival was also longer when compared to 177Lu-PSMA-617, although it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). RBCs counts remained within normal range for the 64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA group. 64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA treated mice showed non-pathological fibrosis and no other signs of radiation injury. Human extrapolation of dosimetry yielded an effective dose of 3.14 × 10-2 mSv/MBq, with highest organs doses to gastrointestinal tract and liver.  Discussion:   Collectively, our data showed that 64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA-directed radioligand therapy was effective for the treatment of LNCaP tumor-bearing NRG mice with acceptable toxicity and dosimetry. The main potential challenge is the hepatic and gastrointestinal irradiation.""","""['Marie-Christine Milot', 'Ophélie Bélissant-Benesty', 'Véronique Dumulon-Perreault', 'Samia Ait-Mohand', 'Sameh Geha', 'Patrick O Richard', 'Étienne Rousseau', 'Brigitte Guérin']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['64Cu-DOTHA2-PSMA, a Novel PSMA PET Radiotracer for Prostate Cancer with a Long Imaging Time Window.', 'Evaluation of a novel GRPR antagonist for prostate cancer PET imaging: 64Cu-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26.', 'Clinical Translation and First In-Human Use of 44ScSc-PSMA-617 for PET Imaging of Metastasized Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'What a difference a methylene makes: replacing Glu with Asp or Aad in the Lys-urea-Glu pharmacophore of PSMA-targeting radioligands to reduce kidney and salivary gland uptake.', 'Development of Novel PSMA Ligands for Imaging and Therapy with Copper Isotopes.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a 64Cu-Based Theranostic Approach in a Murine Model of Multiple Myeloma.']"""

Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms of circRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) proliferation and metastasis remain largely uncertain. Here, we performed circRNA microarray analyses to identify differentially expressed circRNAs in a normal prostate epithelial cell line and PCa cell lines. We found that hsa_circ_0063329 was significantly downregulated in PCa. A series of in vitro and in vivo functional assays showed that overexpression of hsa_circ_0063329 inhibits PCa cell progression, while silencing of hsa_circ_0063329 achieved the opposite effects. Mechanistically, bioinformatics analysis, RNA pulldown, RNA-seq and dual-luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that hsa_circ_0063329 exerts its effect by sponging miR-605-5p to derepress TG-interacting factor 2 (TGIF2) and inactivate the TGF-β pathway. In conclusion, hsa_circ_0063329 inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of PCa via modulation of the miR-605-5p/TGIF2 axis, and targeting hsa_circ_0063329 may provide a promising treatment strategy for aggressive PCa.""","""['Daojun Lv', 'Shengren Cen', 'Shuxin Yang', 'Zihao Zou', 'Jianfeng Zhong', 'Zhaojun Pan', 'Nan Deng', 'Yubin Li', 'Kaihui Wu', 'Jiamin Wang', 'Ping Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Cycle""","""['Hsa_circ_0003258 promotes prostate cancer metastasis by complexing with IGF2BP3 and sponging miR-653-5p.', 'hsa_circ_0062019 promotes the proliferation, migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells via the miR-195-5p/HMGA2 axis.', 'Circ-RNF13, as an oncogene, regulates malignant progression of HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma cells and HBV infection through ceRNA pathway of circ-RNF13/miR-424-5p/TGIF2.', 'Hsa_circ_0001017 promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma by sponging miR-145-5p.', 'Hsa_Circ_0001206 is downregulated and inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Between March 2013 and June 2018, we retrospectively included patients who underwent RP for prostate cancer (PCa) histopathologically proven by RBx and/or TBx. All patients had a prebiopsy MRI by a single radiologist (using PI-RADS score), then transrectal RBx (12cores, blinded to MRI lesions) and TBx (2-4 cores/target) with elastic MRI/ultrasound fusion (UroStation™, Koelis, Grenoble, France). Histological findings were compared: PBx vs. RP.  Results:   One hundred and four patients underwent RP after RBx and/or TBx. ISUP concordance rate was better with the association RBx+TBx 49% (51/104) vs. 43.3% with TBx (P=0.07) and 43.3% with RBx (P=0.13). With RBx, 50% of the patients were downgraded (52/104) against 42.3% (44/104) with TBx (P=0.088). The association RBx+TBx significantly decreased the rate of downgrading of the ISUP score compared to the ISUP score of RP 35.6% (37/104) vs. RBx (50%, P=0.0001) and vs. TBx (42.3%, P=0.016).  Conclusion:   In half of cases, the ISUP score was underestimated in RBx compared to RP specimens. Adding TBx to RBx significantly reduced downgrading. The combination of both biopsy techniques appeared to be the best protocol to get closer to ISUP score and GS of the RP specimens.

TMPRSS2-ERG, SPOP, FOXA1, and IDH1 molecular subtypes have been described, but the association of these subtypes with prognosis in PCa is unclear; their frequency in Colombian patients is also unknown. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded samples of radical prostatectomy from 112 patients with PCa were used. The TMPRSS2-ERG subtype was assessed with fluorescent in situ hybridization.

The protein kinase D (PKD) family has been implicated in prostate cancer development; however, its role in prostate cancer metastasis remains elusive. This study examined the contribution of PKD, particularly PKD2 and PKD3 (PKD2/3), to the metastatic potential of prostate cancer cells and the effect of PKD inhibition on prostate cancer bone metastasis in vivo. Depletion of PKD2/3 by siRNAs or inhibition by the PKD inhibitor CRT0066101 in AR-positive and AR-negative castration-resistant prostate cancer cells potently inhibited colony formation and cell migration. Depletion or inhibition of PKD2/3 significantly blocked tumor cell invasion and suppressed the expression of genes related to bone metastasis in the highly invasive PC3-ML cells. The reduced invasive activity resulting from PKD2/3 depletion was in part mediated by the transcription factor Runx2, as its silencing decreased PKD2/3-mediated metastatic gene expression through the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 signaling axis. Furthermore, inhibition of PKD by CRT0066101 potently decreased the frequency of bone micrometastases in a mouse model of bone metastasis based on intracardiac injection of PC3-ML cells. These results indicate that PKD2/3 plays an important role in the bone metastasis of prostate cancer cells, and its inhibition may be beneficial for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.""","""['Adhiraj Roy', 'Sahdeo Prasad', 'Yuzhou Chen', 'Yapeng Chao', 'Yu Liu', 'Jinjun Zhao', 'Qiming Jane Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Pathol""","""['PKD2 and PKD3 promote prostate cancer cell invasion by modulating NF-κB- and HDAC1-mediated expression and activation of uPA.', 'Protein kinase Ds promote tumor angiogenesis through mast cell recruitment and expression of angiogenic factors in prostate cancer microenvironment.', 'Protein kinase D3 (PKD3) contributes to prostate cancer cell growth and survival through a PKCepsilon/PKD3 pathway downstream of Akt and ERK 1/2.', 'Protein kinase D2: a versatile player in cancer biology.', 'Functional and therapeutic significance of protein kinase D enzymes in invasive breast cancer.']"""

The constant generation of Cd-induced ROS and resulting ER stress induces cellular responses that are needed for cell survival, and autophagy has an important role in this process. However, the mechanisms that regulate Cd-induced ROS and how these differ in terms of acute and chronic cadmium exposure remain unexplained. Here, we show that acute or chronic Cd exposure facilitates NOX1 assembly by activating its cytosolic regulators p47phox and p67phox in RWPE-1 cells. Upregulation of NOX1 complex proteins and generation of ROS activates unfolded protein response (UPR) via phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α), and selective translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Chronic Cd exposure constantly activates NOX1 complex and generates consistent ROS and ER stress that led to defective autophagy, wherein ATG5 expression is downregulated in contrast to acute Cd exposure.

However, the mechanism of CTBP1 in the progression of prostate cancer is still unclear. Here, we aim to investigate how CTBP1 exerts its role in prostate cancer progression, especially how CTBP1 was regulated by the upstream genes. We found that CTBP1 was highly expressed in prostate cancer and promoted the cell viability, migration, invasion and glycolysis of prostate cancer cells. CDH1 was verified to be the target of CTBP1. We determined that CTBP1 could directly bind with SP1 to inhibit the transcription of CDH1. Moreover, succinylation of CTBP1 was found to be up-regulated in prostate cancer cell. Further studies demonstrated that KAT2A promotes the succinylation of CTBP1 and mediates the transcription suppressing activity of it. In addition, the K46 and K280 was confirmed to be the two sites that regulated by KAT2A. In vivo studies further indicated that CTBP1 could promote the growth of prostate cancer, and this effect of CTBP1 could be partially reversed by KAT2A knockdown.

There are currently no established therapies to treat the emotional and psychological burden that sexual issues impose on the couple after PCa.  Aim:   Our study examined the impact of 2 therapies-cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness therapy-on sexual, relational, and psychological outcomes of PCa survivor and partner couples.  Methods:   PCa survivors (n = 68) who self-reported current sexual problems after PCa treatments and their partners were randomized to 4 consecutive weeks of couples' mindfulness therapy, couples' CBT, or no treatment (control).  Outcomes:   Couples' sexual distress, survivors' sexual satisfaction, and couples' relationship satisfaction, quality of life, psychological symptoms (anxiety and depression), and trait mindfulness were measured at baseline, 6 weeks after treatment, and 6 months after treatment.  Results:   Sexual distress and sexual satisfaction were significantly improved 6 weeks after the CBT and mindfulness interventions as compared with the control group, but only sexual distress remained significantly improved at 6 months. Relationship satisfaction decreased and more so for partners than survivors. There were increases in domains of quality of life for survivors vs their partners 6 months after treatments and an overall increase in general quality of life for couples 6 weeks after mindfulness. There were no significant changes in psychological symptoms and trait mindfulness. Qualitative analysis showed that the mindfulness intervention led to greater personal impact on couple intimacy after the study had ended.  Clinical implications:   CBT and mindfulness can be effective treatments for helping couples adapt to and cope with changes to their sexual function after PCa treatments and could help improve the most common concern for PCa survivors-that is, couples' sexual intimacy-after cancer, if added to routine clinical care.  Strengths and limitations:   We used established standardized treatment manuals and highly sensitive statistical methodology and accounted for covariable factors and moderators of primary outcomes. Due to difficulty in recruitment, we had a smaller control group than treatment, reducing our power to detect between-group differences. Our sample was mostly White, heterosexual, and affluent, thereby limiting the generalizability.

In the current study, we found that lincROR is highly expressed in DTX-resistant prostate cancer cell lines and was associated with poor DTX response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. By using loss- and gain-of-function experiments revealed that lincROR promotes prostate cancer cells growth and DTX resistance in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that lincROR specifically interacts with and stabilizes MYH9 protein, which enhances β-catenin/hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) pathways. Besides, HIF1α could bind with the promoter region of lincROR to activate its transcription, thus forming the lincROR/MYH9/HIF1α positive feedback loop. Moreover, lincROR could be packaged into exosomes in an heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (hnRNPA1)-dependent manner and then disseminated chemoresistance phenotype to receipt cells. Overall, our study provides evidence supporting exosome-mediated lincROR activates the β-catenin/HIF1α positive feedback loop by targeting MYH9 protein, which may be exploited for anticancer therapy.

Cell function experiments demonstrated that MEIS2 overexpression was capable of significantly suppressing proliferation of tumor cells, arresting prostate cancer cells in G0/G1 phase, and promoting DNA damage, thereby enhancing the sensitivity of prostate cancer to cisplatin. Dual-luciferase assay and chromatin co-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed the binding relationship between MEIS2 and ELF1. The results of rescue assay showed that ELF1 could promote DNA damage and enhance the sensitivity of tumor cells to cisplatin by activating MEIS2.

The best confirmed prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (≥50% decline [PSA50]), PSA progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were used as endpoints. For external validation, we used plasma LPWGS data from an independent cohort of 70 mCRPC patients receiving first-line ARSI.  Results:   Baseline ctDNA% ranged from ≤3.0% to 73% (median: 6.6%) and CNA burden from 0% to 82% (median: 13.1%) in the discovery cohort. High ctDNA% and high CNA burden at baseline was associated with poor PSA50 response (P = 0.0123/0.0081), poor PFS (P < 0.0001), and poor OS (P < 0.0001). ctDNA% and CNA burden was higher at PSA progression than at baseline in 32.7% and 42.3% of the patients. High ctDNA% and high CNA burden at baseline was also associated with poor PFS and OS (P ≤ 0.0272) in the validation cohort.

Methods:   First primary PCs diagnosed 2004 - 2009 in the population-based Janus Serum Bank (JSB) cohort were identified by linkage to the population-based Cancer Registry of Norway (CRN) (n = 3568). The CRN and Norwegian Prostate Cancer Registry provided clinicopathological data for these cases. Approach 1 classified PC as aggressive if it was clinically T4, or N1, or M1, or had a Gleason score ≥8 at diagnosis (as proposed). Approach 2 classified PC as aggressive if CRN stage at diagnosis was 'regional spread' or 'distant metastases'. Both approaches were validated by calculating the sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) against PC-death within 10 years of diagnosis.  Results:   Overall, 555 died from PC within 10 years. Approach 1 classified 24.7% of cases as aggressive and 13.6% were unclassified due to missing information. Approach 2 classified 19.6% as aggressive and 29% were unclassified. Sensitivity was highest for Approach 1 (0.76, 95% CI: 0.72 - 0.80 vs 0.69, 95% CI: 0.64 - 0.73), while PPVs were similar for both approaches (0.43, 95% CI: 0.40 - 0.46 and 0.40, 95% CI: 0.36 - 0.44).

Methods:   Data from 639 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between April 2006 and December 2017 at Chiba University Hospital and 2 affiliated institutions were retrospectively reviewed. Tumor volume in prostatectomy specimens was measured, and with a tumor volume of less than 0.5 cm3 , the presence of intraductal carcinoma and SC was examined. SC was defined as one that did not meet the definition of pathological insignificant cancer (organ-confined cancer, Grade Group 1, tumor volume < 0.5 cm3 ). The number of patients who met four active surveillance (AS) protocols was also examined.  Results:   A total of 83 patients with tumor volume < 0.5 cm3 were identified in this study population (SC: 43 patients [52%], intraductal carcinoma: 5 patients [6%]). The median follow-up was 34.6 months (range: 18-57 months). Four (5%) developed biochemical recurrence. The number of positive biopsy cores ≥ 2 was an independent predictor of SC in patients with tumor volume < 0.5 cm3 (hazard ratio: 4.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.67-11.56; p = 0.003). In tumor volume < 0.5 cm3 , tumor volume was significantly correlated with the International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group (1 vs. 4-5, p = 0.002) and the presence of intraductal carcinoma (p = 0.004). In intraductal carcinoma-positive cases, four of five patients (80%) had the predictor of SC, which was two or more positive biopsy cores.

They are also found to be involved in the onset and development of various cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Since PCa are commonly driven by androgen regulated signaling, mainly stimulated pathways, identification and determining the influence of lncRNAs in androgen response is useful and necessary. LncRNAs regulated by the androgen receptor (AR) can serve as potential biomarkers for PCa. In the present study, gene expression data analysis were performed to distinguish lncRNAs related to the androgen response pathway.  Methods and results:   We used publicly available RNA-sequencing and ChIP-seq data to identify lncRNAs that are associated with the androgen response pathway. Using Universal Correlation Coefficient (UCC) and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) analyses, we found 15 lncRNAs that have (a) highly correlated expression with androgen response genes in PCa and are (b) differentially expressed in the setting of treatment with an androgen agonist as well as antagonist compared to controls. Using publicly available ChIP-seq data, we investigated the role of androgen/AR axis in regulating expression of these lncRNAs. We observed AR binding in the promoter regions of 5 lncRNAs (MIR99AHG, DUBR, DRAIC, PVT1, and COLCA1), showing the direct influence of AR on their expression and highlighting their association with the androgen response pathway.  Conclusion:   By utilizing publicly available multiomics data and by employing in silico methods, we identified five candidate lncRNAs that are involved in the androgen response pathway.

PCa invasion leads to a disruption of osteogenic-osteolytic balance and causes abnormal bone formation. The interaction between PCa and bone stromal cells, especially osteoblasts (OB), is considered essential for the disease progression. However, drugs that effectively block the cancer-bone interaction and regulate the osteogenic-osteolytic balance remain undiscovered.  Methods:   A reporter gene system was constructed to screen compounds that could inhibit PCa-induced OB activation from 631 compounds. Then, the pharmacological effects of a candidate drug, Procoxacin (Pro), on OBs, osteoclasts (OCs) and cancer-bone interaction were studied in cellular models. Intratibial inoculation, micro-CT and histological analysis were used to explore the effect of Pro on osteogenic and osteolytic metastatic lesions. Bioinformatic analysis and experiments including qPCR, western blotting and ELISA assay were used to identify the effector molecules of Pro in the cancer-bone microenvironment. Virtual screening, molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance assay and RNA knockdown were utilized to identify the drug target of Pro. Experiments including co-IP, western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to reveal the role of Pro binding to its target. Intracardiac inoculation metastasis model and survival analysis were used to investigate the therapeutic effect of Pro on metastatic cancer.  Results:   Luciferase reporter gene consisted of Runx2 binding sequence, OSE2, and Alp promotor could sensitively reflect the intensity of PCa-OB interaction. Pro best matched the screening criteria among 631 compounds in drug screening. Further study demonstrated that Pro effectively inhibited the PCa-induced osteoblastic changes without killing OBs or PCa cells and directly killed OCs or suppressed osteoclastic functions at very low concentrations. Mechanism study revealed that Pro broke the feedback loop of TGF-β/C-Raf/MAPK pathway by sandwiching into 14-3-3ζ/C-Raf complex and prevented its disassociation. Pro treatment alleviated both osteogenic and osteolytic lesions in PCa-involved bones and reduced the number of metastases of PCa in vivo.  Conclusions:   In summary, our study provides a drug screening strategy based on the cancer-host microenvironment and demonstrates that Pro effectively inhibits both osteoblastic and osteoclastic lesions in PCa-involved bones, which makes it a promising therapeutic agent for PCa bone metastasis.""","""['Depei Kong', 'Chen Ye', 'Chenxi Zhang', 'Xiaochen Sun', 'Fubo Wang', 'Rui Chen', 'Guangan Xiao', 'Shipeng He', 'Jianrong Xu', 'Xiwu Rao', 'Jianzhong Ai', 'Xu Gao', 'Hong Li', 'Li Su']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Inhibition of prostate cancer osteoblastic progression with VEGF121/rGel, a single agent targeting osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and tumor neovasculature.', 'Use of zoledronate to treat osteoblastic versus osteolytic lesions in a severe-combined-immunodeficient mouse model.', 'Prostate cancer bone metastases promote both osteolytic and osteoblastic activity.', 'The role of osteoclastic activity in prostate cancer skeletal metastases.']"""

We sought to examine the receipt of guideline-concordant definitive treatment, time to treatment initiation (TTI), and overall survival (OS) for men with CaP receiving care at hospital systems serving health disparity populations (HSDPs).  Methods:   We retrospective analyzed the National Cancer Database (2004-2016). We identified men with intermediate-risk or high-risk CaP eligible for definitive treatment. The primary outcomes were receipt of definitive treatment and TTI within 90 days of diagnosis. The secondary outcome was OS. We defined HSDPs as minority-serving hospitals-facilities in the highest decile of proportion of non-Hispanic Black (NHB) or Hispanic cancer patients-and/or high-burden safety-net hospitals-facilities in the highest quartile of proportion of underinsured patients. We used mixed-effect models with facility-level random intercept to compare outcomes between HSDPs and non-HSDPs among the entire cohort and among men who received definitive treatment.  Results:   We included 968 non-HSDPs (72.2%) and 373 HSDPs (27.8%) facilities. Treatment at HSDPs was associated with lower adjusted odds of receipt of definitive treatment (aOR 0.64; 95% CI 0.57-0.71; P < 0.001), lower odds of TTI within 90 days of diagnosis (aOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.68-0.79; P < 0.001), and worse OS (aHR 1.05; 95% CI 1.02-1.09; P = .003) when accounting for covariates. However, no difference was found in OS if patients received definitive treatment (aHR 1.03; 95% CI 0.99-1.07; P = 0.1). NHB men at HSDPs had worse outcomes than NHB men treated at non-HSDPs as well as NHW men treated at HSDPs.  Conclusion:   Patients treated at HSDPs were less likely to receive timely definitive treatment and had worse OS, independent of their race. NHB men have worse outcomes than NHW at HSDPs. Thus, NHB men with CaP are doubly disadvantaged since they are more likely to be treated at hospitals with worse outcomes and have worse outcomes than other patients at those same institutions.""","""['David-Dan Nguyen', 'Muhieddine Labban', 'Logan Briggs', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Alexander P Cole', 'Stuart R Lipsitz', 'Hari S Iyer', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Joel S Weissman', 'Toni K Choueiri', 'Quoc-Dien Trinh']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Effect of Medicaid Expansion on Receipt of Definitive Treatment and Time to Treatment Initiation by Racial and Ethnic Minorities and at Minority-Serving Hospitals: A Patient-Level and Facility-Level Analysis of Breast, Colon, Lung, and Prostate Cancer.', 'Quality of Care in the Treatment of Localized Intermediate and High Risk Prostate Cancer at Minority Serving Hospitals.', 'Getting back to equal: The influence of insurance status on racial disparities in the treatment of African American men with high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Association of Care at Minority-Serving vs Non-Minority-Serving Hospitals With Use of Palliative Care Among Racial/Ethnic Minorities With Metastatic Cancer in the United States.', 'Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Prostate Cancer Outcomes in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System.']"""

Methods: This single-center, retrospective analysis included patients with BCP or BCR after radical prostatectomy and PB recurrence on 68Ga-PSMA PET. The PB recurrences were delineated by nuclear medicine physicians, the CTVs by radiation oncologists contouring guidelines on the 68Ga-PSMA PET, respectively, masked from each other. The coverage of the 68Ga-PSMA PET recurrence was categorized as PSMA recurrence completely covered, partially covered, or not covered by the RTOG-based CTV. Further, we evaluated the differences in PSMA recurrence patterns among patients with different 68Ga-PSMA PET staging (miTNM). Mann-Whitney U tests, the chi-square test, and Spearman (ρ) correlation analysis were used to investigate associations between CTV coverage and 68Ga-PSMA PET-based tumor volume, serum PSA levels, miTNM, and rectal/bladder involvement. Results: A total of 226 patients were included in the analysis; 127 patients had PSMA recurrence limited to the PB (miTrN0M0), 30 had pelvic nodal disease (miTrN1M0), 32 had extrapelvic disease (miTrN0M1), and 37 had both pelvic nodal disease and extrapelvic disease (miTrN1M1). In the miTrN0M0 cohort, the recurrence involved the rectal and bladder walls in 12 of 127 (9%) and 4 of 127 (3%), respectively. The PSMA-positive PB recurrences were completely covered by the CTV in 68 of 127 patients (53%), partially covered in 43 of 127 (34%), and not covered in 16 of 127 (13%). Full coverage was associated with a smaller tumor volume (P = 0.043), a lack of rectal/bladder wall involvement (P = 0.03), and lower miTNM staging (P = 0.035) but not with lower serum PSA levels (P = 0.979).

However, 188Re is a well-known generator-based therapeutic nuclide that completes a theranostic tandem with 99mTc and may offer an interesting alternative to the currently used radionuclides. In the present work, we aimed at the development of a PSMA-targeted 99mTc/188Re theranostic tandem. Methods: The ligand HYNIC-iPSMA was chosen as the lead structure. Its HYNIC chelator has limitations for 188Re labeling and was replaced by mercaptoacetyltriserine to obtain PSMA-GCK01, a precursor for stable 99mTc and 188Re labeling. 99mTc-PSMA-GCK01 was used for in vitro evaluation of the ligand and comparison with 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA. Planar imaging using 99mTc-PSMA-GCK01 and organ biodistribution with 188Re-PSMA-GCK01 were performed using LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. Finally, the theranostic tandem was applied for imaging and therapy in 3 prostate cancer patients in compassionate care. Results: Efficient radiolabeling of PSMA-GCK01 with both radionuclides was demonstrated. Cell-based assays with 99mTc-PSMA-GCK01 versus 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA revealed comparable uptake characteristics. Planar imaging and organ distribution revealed good tumor uptake of both 99mTc-PSMA-GCK01 and 188Re-PSMA-GCK01 at 1 and 3 h after injection, with low uptake in nontarget organs. In patients, similar distribution patterns were observed for 99mTc-PSMA-GCK01 and 188Re-PSMA-GCK01 and in comparison with 177Lu-PSMA-617. Conclusion: The ligand PSMA-GCK01 labels stably with 99mTc and 188Re, both generator-based radionuclides, and thus provides access to on-demand labeling at reasonable costs. Preclinical evaluation of the compounds revealed favorable characteristics of the PSMA-targeted theranostic tandem.

As such, the development of novel cellular therapies has become of increasing importance to target solid tumor malignancies, such as prostate, lung, breast, bladder, colon, and liver cancers. One such cellular therapy relies on the use of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells). CAR-T cells are engineered to target specific antigens on tumor cells. To date, there are six FDA-approved CAR-T cell therapies that have been utilized for hematologic B cell malignancies. Immune cell trafficking and immunosuppressive factors within the tumor microenvironment increase the relative difficulty in developing a robust CAR-T cell therapy against solid tumors. Therefore, it is critical to develop novel methodologies for high-throughput phenotypic and functional assays using 3D tumor spheroid models to assess CAR-T cell products against solid tumors. In this manuscript, we discuss the use of CAR-T cells targeted towards PSMA, an antigen that is found on prostate cancer tumor cells, the second most common cause of cancer deaths among men worldwide. We demonstrate the use of high-throughput, plate-based image cytometry to characterize CAR-T cell-mediated cytotoxic potency against 3D prostate tumor spheroids. We were able to kinetically evaluate the efficacy and therapeutic value of PSMA CAR-T cells by analyzing the cytotoxicity against prostate tumor spheroids. In addition, the CAR-T cells were fluorescently labeled to visually identify the location of the T cells as cytotoxicity occurs, which may provide more meaningful information for assessing the functionality of the CAR-T cells. The proposed image cytometry method can overcome limitations placed on traditional methodologies to effectively assess cell-mediated 3D tumor spheroid cytotoxicity and efficiently generate time- and dose-dependent results.""","""['David Zurowski', 'Samir Patel', 'Daniel Hui', 'Mignane Ka', 'Charles Hernandez', 'Andrea C Love', 'Bo Lin', 'Andrea Moore', 'Leo Li-Ying Chan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""SLAS Discov""","""['3D hanging spheroid plate for high-throughput CAR T cell cytotoxicity assay.', 'Comparison of chimeric antigen receptor-T cell-mediated cytotoxicity assays with suspension tumor cells using plate-based image cytometry method.', 'Construction of a chimeric antigen receptor bearing a nanobody against prostate a specific membrane antigen in prostate cancer.', 'Perspectives on Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Immunotherapy for Solid Tumors.', 'Chimeric antigen receptor T cells in solid tumors: a war against the tumor microenvironment.', 'The Molecular Biology of Prostate Cancer Stem Cells: From the Past to the Future.']"""

Results:   Voluntarily wheel running inhibited the growth of CRPC xenografts, inhibited the proliferation of tumor cells and promoted the apoptosis of tumor cells. HMGB1 levels in serum and tumor tissues were significantly reduced after exercise, which enhanced local immunity by inducing more leukocyte infiltration and inhibited systemic inflammatory response by regulating cytokines.  Conclusion:   Voluntary wheel running can down-regulate the expression of HMGB1 in serum and transplanted tumor tissues, inhibit proliferation and promote apoptosis of tumor cells, enhance immune cell infiltration and systemic inflammatory response, and regulate local anti-tumor effects in tumor microenvironment.""","""['Zhaoyun Yang', 'Yan Gao', 'Kang He', 'Xin Sui', 'Junyu Chen', 'Taiwei Wang', 'Mengmeng Chen', 'Zeyu Wang', 'Jiang Yi', 'Lijing Zhao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Exp Gerontol""","""['Up-Regulation of HMGB1 Exacerbates Renal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Stimulating Inflammatory and Immune Responses through the TLR4 Signaling Pathway in Mice.', 'Patient-derived Hormone-naive Prostate Cancer Xenograft Models Reveal Growth Factor Receptor Bound Protein 10 as an Androgen Receptor-repressed Gene Driving the Development of Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'HMGB1 promotes the development of castration‑resistant prostate cancer by regulating androgen receptor activation.', 'NDRG2 acts as a negative regulator downstream of androgen receptor and inhibits the growth of androgen-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'NPRL2 enhances autophagy and the resistance to Everolimus in castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We retrospectively reviewed the demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of incarcerated individuals who received radiation therapy at a large safety-net hospital.  Methods:   Following IRB approval, we identified 80 incarcerated patients who presented for radiation therapy between January 2003 and May 2019. Descriptive statistics on the patients, tumor types and stage, treatment factors, and follow-up rates were analyzed.  Results:   80 individuals with 82 cancer diagnoses presented for radiation oncology consultation over the study period. The median age was 54 years (range, 46-64). Patients of White, Black, and ""other"" races comprised 61.3% (n=49), 28.8% (n=23), and 10% (n=8), respectively. Most patients were male (n=75, 93.8%) and English speakers (n=76, 95%). Moreover, 50% (n=40) had a substance use disorder history and 75% (n=60) had a smoking history. The three most common cancer types were prostate (n=12, 14.6%), gastrointestinal (n=14, 17.1%), thoracic (n=17, 20.7%), and head and neck (n=21, 25.6%). The distribution of tumor stage (AJCC) was I (n=12, 14.6%), II (n=12, 14.6%), III (n=14, 17.1%), IV (n=38, 46.3%), and unknown/unavailable (n=6, 7.3%). Of the cohort, 65 patients with 66 cancers (80.5%) received radiation. Among them, the 6-month, 1-year, and 5-year follow-up rates were 41.5%, 27.7%, and 3.1%, respectively. Subset analysis limited to stage I-III patients (n=30) revealed 6-month, 1-year and 5-year follow-up rates of 41.9%, 22.6%, and 3.2%, respectively.  Conclusions:   This study highlights inequalities in cancer stage at diagnosis among a vulnerable patient population that is largely excluded from clinical research. Majority of the incarcerated patients presented with stage III & IV cancers and have poor follow up rates even among those with early-stage disease.

Objective:   To evaluate whether a hyaluronic acid rectal spacer could (1) improve rectal dosimetry and (2) affect acute grade 2 or higher GI toxic effects for hypofractionated RT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 2020 to June 2021 among 12 centers within the US, Australia, and Spain, with a 6-month follow-up. Adult patients with biopsy-proven, T1 to T2 prostate cancer with a Gleason score 7 or less and prostate-specific antigen level of 20 ng/mL or less (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1) were blinded to the treatment arms. Of the 260 consented patients, 201 patients (77.3%) were randomized (2:1) to the presence or absence of the spacer. Patients were stratified by intended 4-month androgen deprivation therapy use and erectile quality.  Main outcomes and measures:   For the primary outcome, we hypothesized that more than 70% of patients in the spacer group would achieve a 25% or greater reduction in the rectal volume receiving 54 Gy (V54). For the secondary outcome, we hypothesized that the spacer group would have noninferior acute (within 3 months) grade 2 or higher GI toxic effects compared with the control group, with a margin of 10%.  Results:   Of the 201 randomized patients, 8 (4.0%) were Asian, 26 (12.9%) Black, 42 (20.9%) Hispanic or Latino, and 153 (76.1%) White; the mean (SD) age for the spacer group was 68.6 (7.2) years and 68.4 (7.3) years for the control group. For the primary outcome, 131 of 133 (98.5%; 95% CI, 94.7%-99.8%) patients in the spacer group experienced a 25% or greater reduction in rectum V54, which was greater than the minimally acceptable 70% (P < .001). The mean (SD) reduction was 85.0% (20.9%). For the secondary outcome, 4 of 136 patients (2.9%) in the spacer group and 9 of 65 patients (13.8%) in the control group experienced acute grade 2 or higher GI toxic effects (difference, -10.9%; 95% 1-sided upper confidence limit, -3.5; P = .01).  Conclusions and relevance:   The trial results suggest that rectal spacing with hyaluronic acid improved rectal dosimetry and reduced acute grade 2 or higher GI toxic effects.

Methods:   Patients eligible for the HYPOSTAT study had localized prostate cancer (cT1‑3 cN0 cM0), Gleason score ≤ 7, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) ≤ 15 ng/ml, prostate volume ≤ 80 cm3, and an International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) ≤ 12. Initially, inclusion was limited to patients ≥ 75 years or patients 70-74 years with additional risk factors. The trial protocol was later amended to allow for enrolment of patients aged ≥ 60 years. The treatment consisted of 35 Gy delivered in 5 fractions to the prostate and for intermediate- or high-risk patients, also to the proximal seminal vesicles using the CyberKnife system (Accuray Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Primary endpoint was the rate of treatment-related gastrointestinal or genitourinary grade ≥ 2 toxicity based on the RTOG scale 12-15 months after treatment. Secondary endpoints were acute toxicity, late toxicity, urinary function, quality of life, and PSA response.  Results:   From July 2016 through December 2018, 85 eligible patients were enrolled and received treatment, of whom 83 could be evaluated regarding the primary endpoint. Patients mostly had intermediate-risk disease with a median PSA value of 7.97 ng/ml and Gleason score of 7a and 7b in 43.5% and 25.9% of patients, respectively. At the final follow-up 12-15 months after treatment, no patient suffered from treatment-related gastrointestinal or genitourinary grade ≥ 2 toxicity. Acute toxicity was mostly mild, with three grade 3 events, and the cumulative rate of grade ≥ 2 genitourinary toxicity was 8.4% (95% CI 4.1-16.4%). There were no major changes in urinary function or quality of life. The median PSA value dropped to 1.18 ng/ml 12-15 months after treatment. There was one patient who developed distant metastases.

Research design and methods:   Here, we applied AlphaFold multimer, network and single cells database analyses to highlight specificity of Androgen receptor (AR) against spike receptor binding protein (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.  Results:   LXXL motifs in spike RBD are essential for AR binding. RBD LXXA mutation complex with the AR depicting slightly reduced binding energy, as LXXLL motif usually mediates nuclear receptor binding to coregulators. Moreover, AR preferred to bind a LYRL motif in specificity and interaction interface, and showed reduced affinity against Omicron compared to other variants (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). Importantly, RBD LYRL motif is a conserved antigenic epitope (9 residues) for T-cell response. Network analysis of AR-related genes against COVID-19 database showed T-cell signaling regulation, and CD8+ T-cell spatial location in AR+ single cells, which is consistent with the AR binding motif LYRL in epitope function.

However, whether HIF-1α in the hypoxic microenvironment mediates the transformation of prostate cancer to a stem cell phenotype and the mechanism have not been elucidated.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) from PC-3 cell lines were examined for the expression of CD44, CD133, ALDH1, HIF-1α, Notch1, and HES1. We observed the effect of knockdown HIF-1α in vitro and mice models and evaluated the impact of HIF-1α on the Notch1 pathway as well as stem cell dedifferentiation. The effects on sphere formation, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, and invasive metastasis were evaluated.  Results:   In our study, hypoxia upregulated HIF-1α expression and induced a stem cell phenotype through activation of the Notch1 pathway, leading to enhanced proliferation, invasion, and migration of PCa PC-3 cells. The knockdown of HIF-1α significantly inhibited cell dedifferentiation and the ability to proliferate, invade and metastasize. However, the inhibitory effect of knocking down HIF-1α was reversed by Jagged1, an activator of the Notch1 pathway. These findings were further confirmed in vivo, where hypoxia could enhance the tumorigenicity of xenograft tumors by upregulating the expression of HIF-1α to activate the Notch1 pathway. In addition, the expression of HIF-1α and Notch1 was significantly increased in human PCa tissues, and high expression of HIF-1α correlated with the malignancy of PCa.

It remains a challenge to develop a simple approach to target PC with specific antibodies. In our study, D2B monoclonal antibodies against a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) were used. We investigated the functionalization of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with D2B to generate favorable physicochemical and biological properties that mediate specific binding to PC. For this purpose, AuNPs with a size of about 25 nm were synthesized in water using sodium citrate as a reducing and stabilizing agent and then coated with D2B. Major physicochemical properties of naked and D2B-coated AuNPs were investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurements. The successful binding of D2B to AuNPs-citrate caused a 15 nm red shift in the UV-vis. This was assessed by DLS as an increase in zeta potential from ∼-45 to ∼-23 mV and in the size of AuNPs from ∼25 to ∼63 nm. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the size shift of AuNPs, which was detected as an exterior organic layer of D2Bs surrounding each AuNP. Even at high exposure levels of the bioconjugates, PSMA-PC-3 cells exhibited minimal cytotoxicity. The specific and dose-dependent binding of AuNPs-D2B to PC-3-PSMA cells was validated by flow cytometry analysis.

These clonal proliferations require biallelic TET2 disruption and sustained expression of the AP-1 factor BATF3 to drive a MYC-dependent proliferative program. This proliferative state is associated with reduced effector function that differs from both canonical T cell memory13,14 and exhaustion15,16 states, and is prone to the acquisition of secondary somatic mutations, establishing TET2 as a guardian against BATF3-induced CAR T cell proliferation and ensuing genomic instability.

Prospective data on stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) are very scarce.  Objective:   To determine the optimal dose regimen for salvage SBRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   The present report concerns the phase 1 part of the GETUG-AFU 31 multicenter open-label study. The main inclusion criteria were histologically proven biochemical recurrence, clinical stage T1-T2 upon relapse, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging data, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level ≤10 ng/ml prior to salvage SBRT, PSA doubling time >10 mo, and an International Prostate Symptom Score of ≤12.  Intervention:   Five or six fractions of 6 Gy were delivered using focal SBRT.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as grade ≥3 gastrointestinal or genitourinary tract toxicity, or any grade 4 toxicity (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03) occurring in the first 18 wk following treatment initiation.

Results and limitations:   Twenty-one patients were treated (median [interquartile range] age: 76.8 yr [72.2-80.8]), including 12 at 6 × 6 dose level. No DLT was observed.

However, little is known about lingering toxicities in patients who develop metastatic recurrence. We aimed to compare the prevalence of local treatment-related side effects in patients with metastatic recurrence and those in remission, and to explore to what extent medical oncologists address this morbidity.  Methods:   This was a single site, cross-sectional study evaluating patient-reported outcomes using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Clinical Practice (EPIC-CP) instrument, which measures Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) across urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domains, with higher scores reflecting increased symptom burden. The primary endpoint was differences in overall and domain-specific EPIC-CP scores between the metastatic and localized cohorts, with secondary endpoints evaluating provider interventions for symptom alleviation.  Results:   Median total EPIC-CP scores were higher in the metastatic cohort (18.0, IQR 13.0-24.0) compared to the localized cohort (10.0, 6.0-15.0) (P < 0.001). This difference was mostly driven by worsening symptoms in the sexual (8.0, 8.0-9.0 vs. 6.0, 3.0-8.0) (P < 0.001) and hormonal domains (2.0, 1.0-6.0 vs. 0.0, 0.0-2.0) (P < 0.001), although there were also differences in the urinary irritation/obstruction (3.0, 0.0-3.0 vs. 1.0, 0.0-2.0) (P < 0.001) and bowel domains (1.0, 0.0-3.0 vs. 0.0, 0.0-0.0) (P < 0.001). There was a trend towards higher scores in patients that had received RT as primary treatment. Medical oncologists rarely changed management in response to local symptoms.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer patients with metastatic recurrence suffer from a higher burden of localized treatment-related symptoms compared with patients in remission, with primary RT associated with more prevalent toxicity than radical prostatectomy. There is an unmet need for more intensive management of local symptoms.

Methods:   Seventy-nine patients were recruited in a phase 2/3 clinical trial to undergo 18 F-fluciclovine PET/CT before SRT for PCa. Four patients with extrapelvic disease were excluded. All patients were followed up at regular intervals up to 48 months. Treatment failure was defined as a serum prostate-specific antigen level of ≥0.2 ng/mL above the nadir after SRT, confirmed with an additional measurement, requiring systemic treatment or clinical progression. Failure-free survival was computed and compared between patients grouped according to 18 F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging findings.  Results:   Eighty percent (60/75) of patients had a positive finding on 18 F-fluciclovine PET/CT, of which 56.7% (34/60) had prostate bed-only uptake, whereas 43.3% (26/60) had pelvic nodal ± bed uptake. Following SRT, disease failure was detected in 36% (27/75) of patients. There was a significant difference in FFS between patients who had a positive versus negative scan (62.3% vs 92.9% [ P < 0.001] at 36 months and 59.4% vs 92.9% [ P < 0.001] at 48 months). Similarly, there was a significant difference in FFS between patients with uptake in pelvic nodes ± bed versus prostate bed only at 36 months (49.8% vs 70.7%; P = 0.003) and at 48 months (49.8% vs 65.6%; P = 0.040). Failure-free survival was also significantly higher in patients with either negative PET/CT or prostate bed-only disease versus those with pelvic nodal ± prostate bed disease at 36 (78% vs 49.8%, P < 0.001) and 48 months (74.4% vs 49.8%, P < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Findings on pre-SRT 18 F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging, even when acted upon to optimize the treatment decisions and treatment planning, are predictive of post-SRT FFS in men who experience PCa recurrence after radical prostatectomy.

Materials and methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer in 2004-2016 who were initially managed with observation for a minimum of 12 months. The primary objective was to examine rates of PSA testing, prostate biopsy, and prostate MRI.

Patients and methods:   Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research (SAKK) 08/16 is a randomized phase II study. Patients with mCRPC who received prior androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and subsequently had nonprogressive disease on a taxane were randomly assigned to darolutamide 600 mg twice a day or placebo twice a day. The primary end point was radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) at 12 weeks. Secondary end points were rPFS, event-free survival, overall survival (OS), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 50% response rate, and adverse events.  Results:   Overall, 92 patients were recruited by 26 centers. Prior taxane was docetaxel in 93% and cabazitaxel in 7%. Prior ARPI was abiraterone in 60%, enzalutamide in 31%, and both in 9%. rPFS at 12 weeks was significantly improved with darolutamide (64.7% v 52.2%; P = .127). Median rPFS on darolutamide was 5.5 versus 4.5 months on placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54 [95% CI, 0.32 to 0.91]; P = .017), and median event-free survival was 5.4 versus 2.9 months (HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.29 to 0.73]; P = .001).

Treatment-related adverse events were similar in both arms.  Conclusion:   SAKK 08/16 met its primary end point, showing that switch maintenance with darolutamide after prior taxane chemotherapy and at least one ARPI resulted in a statistically significant but clinically modest rPFS prolongation with good tolerability. The median OS with darolutamide maintenance appears promising.

Materials and methods:   A single-institution analysis was performed of men who underwent MRI, targeted biopsy, and radical prostatectomy from July 2012 to April 2021. Men who were candidates for focal gland ablation were identified. The ability of MRI to identify prostate cancer within 5 mm of the prostatic urethra as confirmed on whole-mount pathology was assessed. Multivariate regression was utilized to determine characteristics associated with prostate cancer within 5 mm of the urethra on whole-mount pathology.  Results:   In 48 out of 67 men (72%), the tumor was within 5 mm of the urethra on whole-mount pathology. MRI was concordant with whole-mount pathology in 49 out of 67 men (73%). The sensitivity of MRI for identifying cancer within 5 mm of the urethra was 77% (65%-89%) and the specificity was 63% (42%-89%). The positive predictive value was 84% (range 73%-95%) and negative predictive value was 52% (32%-73%). In adjusted analysis, PSA density and Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System were not significantly associated with having prostate cancer within close proximity of the urethra.  Conclusions:   A significant number of men who are potential candidates for focal gland ablation have cancer within close proximity to the urethra that could serve as a significant source of in-field recurrence. The sensitivity of MRI for identifying these lesions is 77% and can be used to further improve patient selection for focal gland ablation.""","""['Neal Patel', 'Alexa Hughes', 'Jj H Zhang', 'Wayne Brisbane', 'Ali Rastegarpour', 'Sohrab Afsahir', 'Lorna Kwan', 'Anissa V Nguyen', 'Anthony Sisk', 'Steve Raman', 'Robert Reiter']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Focal Therapy Eligibility Determined by Magnetic Resonance Imaging/Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy.', 'Candidate selection for quadrant-based focal ablation through a combination of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and prostate biopsy.', 'Pathological and 3 Tesla Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Predictors of Biochemical Recurrence after Robotic Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Correlation with Whole Mount Histopathology.', 'Value of Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Measurements of Anatomical Structures on Preoperative Prostate Imaging in Predicting Urinary Continence After Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'MR-guided biopsy and focal therapy: new options for prostate cancer management.']"""

Results:   Of 335 prostate cancer patients, 200 could be assessed for biochemical recurrence, clinical recurrence, and overall survival. Human prostate cancer tissues showed higher expression of UBE2C than adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. High expression level of UBE2C showed a strong positive relationship with a high prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason's score, and pathological stage of prostate cancer.

We aimed to quantify age-related differences in relative survival (RS-1-year and 1-year conditioning on surviving 1 year) for 10 common cancer types by stage at diagnosis. We used data from 18 United States Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results cancer registries and included cancers diagnosed in 2012 to 2016 followed until December 31, 2017. We estimated absolute differences in RS between the 50 to 64 age group and the 75 to 84 age group. The smallest differences were observed for prostate and breast cancers (1.8%-points [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-2.1] and 1.9%-points [95% CI: 1.5-2.3], respectively). The largest was for ovarian cancer (27%-points, 95% CI: 24-29). For other cancers, differences ranged between 7 (95% CI: 5-9, esophagus) and 18%-points (95% CI: 17-19, pancreas). Except for pancreatic cancer, cancer type and stage combinations with very high (>95%) or very low (<40%) 1-year RS tended to have smaller age-related differences in survival than those with mid-range prognoses. Age-related differences in 1-year survival conditioning on having survived 1-year were small for most cancer and stage combinations. The broad variation in survival differences by age across cancer types and stages, especially in the first year, age-related differences in survival are likely influenced by amenability to treatment. Future work to measure the extent of age-related differences that are avoidable, and identify how to narrow the survival gap, may have most benefit by prioritizing cancers with relatively large age-related differences in survival (eg, stomach, esophagus, liver and pancreas).""","""['Diana R Withrow', 'Brian D Nicholson', 'Eva J A Morris', 'Melisa L Wong', 'Sophie Pilleron']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Cancer""","""['Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Disparities by Race, Age, and Sex in the Improvement of Survival for Major Cancers: Results From the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program in the United States, 1990 to 2010.', 'Age-related differences in colon and rectal cancer survival by stage, histology, and tumour site: An analysis of United States SEER-18 data.', 'Cancer survival and incidence from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.', 'FIGO stage, histology, histologic grade, age and race as prognostic factors in determining survival for cancers of the female gynecological system: an analysis of 1973-87 SEER cases of cancers of the endometrium, cervix, ovary, vulva, and vagina.']"""

Accumulated stress plays an important role in CVD development. The cumulative burden of chronic stress and life events can be measured using allostatic load (AL).  Methods:   The initial cohort included males aged 18 years and older diagnosed with PC (2005-2019). AL was modeled as an ordinal variable (0-11). Fine-Gray competing risk regressions measured the impact of precancer diagnosis AL and postdiagnosis AL in 2-year major cardiac events (MACE). The effect of AL changes over time on MACE development was calculated via piecewise Cox regression (before, and 2 months, 6 months, and 1 year after PC diagnosis).  Results:   We included 5261 PC patients of which 6.6% had a 2-year MACE. For every 1-point increase in AL before and within 60 days after PC diagnosis, the risk of MACE increased 25% (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] =1.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18 to 1.33) and 27% (aHR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.20 to 1.35), respectively.

A generalized linear model adjusted with age, preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason Grade Group and filtered for germline copy number variations (gCNV) identified 143 loci where copy number varied significantly by percent African ancestry, clustering on chromosomes 6p, 10q, 11p, 12p, and 17p. Multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for age, preoperative PSA levels, and Gleason Grade Group revealed that chromosome 8q gains (including MYC) were significantly associated with biochemical recurrence and metastasis, independent of genetic ancestry. Finally, Treg density in BL and WH patients was significantly correlated with percent genome altered, and these findings were validated in the TCGA cohort. Taken together, our findings identify specific sCNA linked to genetic ancestry and outcome in primary prostate cancer and demonstrate that Treg infiltration varies by global sCNA burden in primary disease.""","""['Thiago Vidotto', 'Eddie L Imada', 'Farzana Faisal', 'Sanjana Murali', 'Adrianna A Mendes', 'Harsimar Kaur', 'Siqun Zheng', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Edward M Schaeffer', 'William B Isaacs', 'Karen S Sfanos', 'Luigi Marchionni', 'Tamara L Lotan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCI Insight""","""['Breast and prostate cancers harbor common somatic copy number alterations that consistently differ by race and are associated with survival.', 'Race, genetic West African ancestry, and prostate cancer prediction by prostate-specific antigen in prospectively screened high-risk men.', 'Racial differences in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) doubling time, histopathological variables and long-term PSA recurrence between African-American and white American men undergoing radical prostatectomy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Differences in Prostate Cancer Genomes by Self-reported Race: Contributions of Genetic Ancestry, Modifiable Cancer Risk Factors, and Clinical Factors.', 'Clinical and Genomic Characterization of Low-Prostate-specific Antigen, High-grade Prostate Cancer.']"""

Since NE cells do not express androgen receptors (ARs), they are resistant to hormonal therapy and contribute to therapy failure. Here, we describe the identification of glypican-3 (GPC3) as an oncofetal cell surface protein specific to NE cells in prostate cancer.

Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated the clinicopathologic information of 132 mCRPC cases receiving AA treatment after chemohormonal therapy at hormone-sensitive stage from July 2018 to June 2021. All patients were divided into AA responders and non-responders according to the biochemical response to AA (prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction ≥50% than pretreatment). Multivariate Logistic analysis was used to determine the independent predictors and develop predictive model of biochemical response to AA. Cox regression analysis was utilized to investigate the prognostic factors for time to biochemical progression (TTBP), radiological progression-free survival (rPFS), failure-free survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) after AA treatment.  Results:   There were 57 AA responders and 75 AA non-responders. Periprostatic fat area/prostate area (PPFA/PA) was decreased and skeletal muscle index (SMI) was increased in AA responders compared with AA non-responders. Multivariable logistic analysis demonstrated that ADT duration ≥12 months, bone metastasis only, high SMI and low PPFA/PA were independent predictors of biochemical response to AA treatment. The FFS, TTBP, rPFS, and OS of patients with lower SMI or higher PPFA/PA was decreased compared with that of patients with higher SMI or lower PPFA/PA, respectively. Combining SMI, PPFA/PA, ADT duration and metastatic sites performed well in differentiating AA responders from non-responders.

However, sensitivity to carbon beams varies between cell lines, that is, it should be checked that the clinical dose distribution based on the cell radiosensitivity of the treatment site is uniform within the PTV. [Methods] We modeled the linear energy transfer (LET) dependence of the linear-quadratic (LQ) coefficients specific to prostate cancer, which accounts for the majority of CIRT. This was achieved by irradiating prostate cancer cells (PC3) with X-rays from a 4 MV-Linac and carbon beams with different LETs of 11.1-214.3 keV/μm. By using the radiosensitivity of PC3 cells derived from cellular experiments, we reconstructed prostate-cancer-specific clinical dose distributions on patient computed tomography (CT). [Results] The LQ coefficient, α, of PC3 cells was larger than that of HSG cells at low (<50 keV/μm) LET and smaller at high (>50 keV/μm) LET, which was validated by cellular experiments performed on rectangular SOBPs. The reconstructed dose distribution on patient CT was sloped when 1 fraction incident from the one side of the patient was considered, but remained uniform from the sum of 12 fractions of the left-right opposing beams (as is used in clinical practice).

Methods:   This retrospective IRB-approved study included 281 patients undergoing prostate MRI prior to biopsy. Four readers (2 experienced, 2 novice) independently reviewed all MRI examinations (n = 295) and assigned scores for subjective image quality (1-5; 1:poor, 5:excellent), the PI-QUAL and the PSHS scoring system. The original PI-RADS scores were extracted from the report and transperineal template saturation biopsy served as histopathological reference.  Results:   Inter-reader agreement was found to be good, with PSHS showing highest agreement (kappa: 0.65). The PSHS scoring system performed well assessing the influence of image quality on sensitivity of MR for clinically-significant cancer for the experienced readers using a PI-RADS score cut-off ≥ 3/≥4, as did the PI-QUAL scoring system with a PI-RADS cut-off ≥ 4. For the less experienced radiologist, this was true for PSHS (clinically-significant and all cancers) and PI-QUAL scores (clinically-significant cancers) for a PI-RADS score ≥ 3. PSHS scores were positively associated with the detection of clinically-significant cancer based on a PI-RADS cut-off ≥ 4, OR 1.86 (95 % CI 1.22-2.82), and had the highest Somers' D.  Conclusions:   The PSHS scoring system performed well in assessing the effect of image quality on detection rates, as did the PI-QUAL system.

A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is needed to identify effective targets to overcome resistance. Given the complexity of the transcriptional dynamics in cells, differential gene expression analysis of bulk transcriptomics data cannot provide sufficient detailed insights into resistance mechanisms. Incorporating network structures could overcome this limitation to provide a global and functional perspective of Abi resistance in mCRPC. Here, we developed TraRe, a computational method using sparse Bayesian models to examine phenotypically driven transcriptional mechanistic differences at three distinct levels: transcriptional networks, specific regulons, and individual transcription factors (TF). TraRe was applied to transcriptomic data from 46 patients with mCRPC with Abi-response clinical data and uncovered abrogated immune response transcriptional modules that showed strong differential regulation in Abi-responsive compared with Abi-resistant patients. These modules were replicated in an independent mCRPC study. Furthermore, key rewiring predictions and their associated TFs were experimentally validated in two prostate cancer cell lines with different Abi-resistance features. Among them, ELK3, MXD1, and MYB played a differential role in cell survival in Abi-sensitive and Abi-resistant cells. Moreover, ELK3 regulated cell migration capacity, which could have a direct impact on mCRPC. Collectively, these findings shed light on the underlying transcriptional mechanisms driving Abi response, demonstrating that TraRe is a promising tool for generating novel hypotheses based on identified transcriptional network disruptions.  Significance:   The computational method TraRe built on Bayesian machine learning models for investigating transcriptional network structures shows that disruption of ELK3, MXD1, and MYB signaling cascades impacts abiraterone resistance in prostate cancer.""","""['Charles Blatti#', 'Jesús de la Fuente#', 'Huanyao Gao', 'Irene Marín-Goñi', 'Zikun Chen', 'Sihai D Zhao', 'Winston Tan', 'Richard Weinshilboum', 'Krishna R Kalari', 'Liewei Wang', 'Mikel Hernaez']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Identification of Somatic Gene Signatures in Circulating Cell-Free DNA Associated with Disease Progression in Metastatic Prostate Cancer by a Novel Machine Learning Platform.', 'AKR1C3 expression in primary lesion rebiopsy at the time of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer is strongly associated with poor efficacy of abiraterone as a first-line therapy.', 'Relation between plasma trough concentration of abiraterone and prostate-specific antigen response in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'A Novel Use of Olaparib for the Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

The optimal treatment strategy is unknown. We sought to further characterize the clinical, histomorphologic, and molecular characteristics of AMPC and to identify areas of potential future treatment investigations.  Methods:   We retrospectively identified 17 cases of AMPC at a single institution, defined as synaptophysin expression in >70% of cells and co-expression of androgen receptor (AR) signaling markers (either AR, PSA, or NKX3.1) in >50% of cells. Clinical and histologic features of AMPC cases as well as response to treatment and clinical outcomes were described.  Results:   Five AMPC cases arose de novo in the absence of prior systemic treatment and behaved distinctly from cases that were treatment-emergent. In these de novo cases, despite expression of neuroendocrine markers, prognosis appeared more favorable than high-grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, with two (40%) patients with de novo metastatic disease, universal response to androgen deprivation therapy, and no deaths at a median follow-up of 12.3 months. Treatment-emergent AMPC arose a median of 41.1 months after androgen deprivation therapy initiation and was associated with poor response to therapy.

Methods and results:   Nine hundred eighty-one men with clinically localised PCa managed conservatively were reviewed with follow up. The number of positive cores (NPC), the Maximum Cancer Length in a core (MCL), Total Cancer Length (TCL), and percentage of positive cores (%+cores) was calculated and univariate and multivariate analysis performed using prostate-specific antigen (PSA), T-stage, and Gleason score. The presence of stromal gaps (SG) was recorded. Univariate models were run where SG made a difference to the MCL. All variables showed significant association with PCa death in univariate models. In multivariate models, incorporating PSA, T-stage, and Gleason score, only %+cores was a significant predictor of outcome, with a 10% increase in %+cores resulting in a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.07 (likelihood-ratio test P > Χ2 = 0.01). There were 120 patients where SG made a difference to the MCL and a total of 20 events in this group. Including SG, on univariate analysis the median MCL was 10 mm and HR was 1.16 (P = 0.007), not including SG, the median MCL was 6 mm and HR was 1.23 (P = 6.3 × 10-4 ). Inclusion or exclusion of SG made no significant difference to TCL as a predictor of outcome.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective study of patients who underwent surgical treatment for metastatic spinal tumors between 1996 and 2020. For trend analysis, the study cohort was divided into three groups according to the year of surgery: 1996-2004, 2005-2012, and 2013-2020. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to examine survival, and the log-rank test was used to compare the survival of the top six common cancers among the periods. The surgical methods were grouped and examined as follows: fixation only, palliative decompression and fixation, gross total removal and fixation, and total en bloc spondylectomy.  Results:   This study included a total of 608 patients. There were 78 patients in 1996-2004, 236 in 2005-2012, and 294 in 2013-2020. Regarding the overall survival trend, the group 2013-2020 had a significantly improved survival as compared to the other two groups (p < 0.001).

However, no studies have systematically investigated the fatty acid metabolism related-gene set in prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   A cohort of 381 patients with gene expression and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas was used as the training set, while another cohort of 90 patients with PCa from GEO (GSE70769) was used as the validation set. Differentially expressed fatty acid metabolism-related genes were subjected to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)-Cox regression to establish a fatty acid metabolism-related risk score. Associations between the risk score and clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration, tumor mutation burden (TMB), tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE) score, and response to chemotherapy were analyzed. Finally, the expression level of genes included in the model was validated using real-time PCR.  Results:   A prognostic risk model based on five fatty acid metabolism related genes (ALDH1A1, CPT1B, CA2, CROT, and NUDT19) were constructed. Tumors with higher risk score were associated with larger tumor size, lymph node involvement, higher Gleason score, and poorer biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival. Furthermore, the high- and low-risk tumors exhibited distinct immune cell infiltration features and immune-related pathway activation. High-risk tumors were associated with favorable response to immunotherapy as indicated by high TMB and low TIDE score, but poor response to bicalutamide and docetaxel chemotherapy.

Osteoblasts (OBs) are known to be responsible for the synthesis and mineralization of bone, although it is unclear as to whether PCa in the prostate gland cooperates with OBs in bone to promote PCa malignant transformation. We aimed to elucidate how primary PCa cells cooperate with distal OBs and contribute to the vicious cycle that leads to metastatic PCa. Methods: N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Twist protein expression were measured by Western blot. Twist translocation into the nucleus was detected by the immunofluorescence (IF) assay. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detected protein levels in human serum samples. Levels of candidate protein expression were examined by the human cytokine array. Prostate tumor growth and metastasis were analyzed by orthotopic and metastatic prostate cancer models, respectively. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was used to observe ADAM metallopeptidase domain 9 (ADAM9) and WNT1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1 (WISP-1) expression in tissue. Results: Our in vitro and in vivo analyses have now discovered that primary PCa expressing ADAM9 protein enables the transformation of OBs into PCa-associated osteoblasts (PCa-OBs), inducing WISP-1 secretion from PCa-OBs in the bone microenvironment. The upregulation of WISP-1 in bone provided feedback to primary PCa and promoted PCa cell aggressiveness via epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) activity. Elevated levels of WISP-1 expression were detected in the serum of patients with PCa. ADAM9 levels were overexpressed in tumor tissue from PCa patients; ADAM9 blockade interrupted OB-induced release of WISP-1 and also suppressed primary tumor growth and distal metastasis in orthotopic PCa mouse models. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the ADAM9/WISP-1 axis assists with metastatic PCa progression.

We explored the combination of TRAIL-inducing compound ONC201/TIC10 and Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-263 to target the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively, in solid tumor cell lines (N = 13) derived from different tissues (colon, prostate, lung, breast, ovary, bladder). We found an IC50 range of 0.83-20.10 μM for ONC201 and 0.06-14.75 μM for ABT-263 among the 13 cancer cell lines. We show that combination of ONC201 and ABT-263 produces a strong synergistic effect leading to tumor cell death, and that the combination is not toxic to human fibroblast cells. In OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells, 2.5 μM ONC201 and 1.25 μM ABT-263 yielded 37% and 27% inhibition of viability, respectively, while the combination of the two agents yielded 92% inhibition of viability, resulting in a high synergy score of 52; conversely, the same combination in the HFF-1 human fibroblast cells yielded 2.45% inhibition of viability and a synergy score of 6.92 (synergy scores were calculated using SynergyFinder; scores greater than 10 are considered synergistic). We also found that the combination of these two agents resulted in synergistic caspase activation and PARP cleavage consistent with induction of apoptosis. Combination therapy-induced cell death correlated with decreased levels of Mcl-1, BAG3, pAkt, and upregulation of Noxa along with Bax cleavage during apoptosis at 48 hours, and ATF4, TRAIL, and DR5 induction at 24 hours. There was some heterogeneity in the cell lines with regard to these responses.

Methods:   We used multiple publicly available databases to explore the expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 (Basigin [BSG]) in major organs in the healthy and disease-specific populations, particularly the genitourinary organs. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to analyze the cell-specific expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, cytokine receptors, and cytokine interacting proteins in genitourinary organs, such as the bladder, kidney, prostate, and testis. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis was used to investigate the relationship between testosterone levels and COVID-19 vulnerability in patients with prostate cancer.  Results:   The results revealed that ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were highly expressed in normal urogenital organs. Then, they were also highly expressed in multiple tumors and chronic kidney diseases. Additionally, ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147 were significantly expressed in a range of cells in urogenital organs according to single-cell RNA sequencing. Cytokine receptors and cytokine interacting proteins, especially CCL2, JUN, and TIMP1, were commonly highly expressed in urogenital organs.

This study determined how gankyrin, a component of the 19S regulatory complex of the 26S proteasome, regulates the progression and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) resistance of prostate cancer through tumor cell-TAM interactions. In vitro functional experiments and in vivo subcutaneous tumor models were used to explore the biological role and molecular mechanisms of gankyrin in prostate cancer cell-TAM interactions. 234 prostate cancer patients were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts to examine the prognostic value of gankyrin through immunohistochemistry (IHC) and statistical analyses, and high gankyrin expression was correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, gankyrin facilitated the progression and ADT resistance of prostate cancer. Mechanistically, gankyrin recruited and upregulated non-POU-domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO) expression, resulting in increased androgen receptor (AR) expression. AR then bound to the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) promoter to trigger HMGB1 transcription, expression, and secretion. Moreover, HMGB1 was found to promote the recruitment and activation of TAMs, which secrete IL-6 to reciprocally promote prostate cancer progression, ADT resistance and gankyrin expression via STAT3, resulting in formation of a gankyrin/NONO/AR/HMGB1/IL-6/STAT3 positive feedback loop. Furthermore, targeting the interaction between tumor cells and TAMs by blocking this loop inhibited ADT resistance in a tumor xenograft model. Taken together, the data show that gankyrin serves as a reliable prognostic indicator and therapeutic target for prostate cancer patients.""","""['Guang Peng', 'Chao Wang', 'Hongru Wang', 'Min Qu', 'Keqin Dong', 'Yongwei Yu', 'Yuquan Jiang', 'Sishun Gan', 'Xu Gao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Oncoimmunology""","""['Blocking the Feedback Loop between Neuroendocrine Differentiation and Macrophages Improves the Therapeutic Effects of Enzalutamide (MDV3100) on Prostate Cancer.', 'Blocking the autocrine regulatory loop of Gankyrin/STAT3/CCL24/CCR3 impairs the progression and pazopanib resistance of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.', 'Reciprocal Network between Cancer Stem-Like Cells and Macrophages Facilitates the Progression and Androgen Deprivation Therapy Resistance of Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'The androgen receptor-targeted proteolysis targeting chimera and other alternative therapeutic choices in overcoming the resistance to androgen deprivation treatment in prostate cancer.']"""

Lower quality care may contribute to this higher death rate.  Methods:   Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained for men in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare diagnosed with clinically localized prostate cancer (cT1-4N0/xM0/x) and managed primarily by radical prostatectomy (2005-2015). Surgical volume was determined for facility and surgeon. Relationships between race, surgeon and/or facility volume, and characteristics of treating facility with survival (all-cause and cancer-specific) were assessed using multivariable Cox regression and competing risk analysis.  Results:   Black men represented 6.7% (n = 2123) of 31,478 cohort. They were younger at diagnosis, had longer time from diagnosis to surgery, lower socioeconomic status, higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and higher comorbid status compared with men of other races (p < .001). They were less likely to receive care from a surgeon or facility in the top volume percentile (p < .001); less likely to receive surgical care at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center and more likely seen at a minority-serving hospital; and less likely to travel ≥50 miles for surgical care. On multivariable analysis stratified by surgical volume, Black men receiving care from a surgeon or facility with lower volumes demonstrated increased risk of prostate cancer mortality (hazard ratio, 1.61; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-2.69) adjusting for age, clinical stage, PSA, and comorbidity index.  Conclusions:   Black Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer more commonly receive care from surgeons and facilities with lower volumes, likely affecting surgical quality and outcomes. Access to high-quality prostate cancer care may reduce racial inequities in disease outcomes, even among insured men.  Plain language summary:   Black men are twice as likely to die of prostate cancer than other US men. Lower quality care may contribute to higher rates of prostate cancer death. We used surgical volume to evaluate the relationship between race and quality of care. Black Medicare beneficiaries with prostate cancer more commonly received care from surgeons and facilities with lower volumes, correlating with a higher risk of prostate cancer death and indicating scarce resources for care. Access to high-quality prostate cancer care eases disparities in disease outcomes. Patient-centered interventions that increase access to high-quality care for Black men with prostate cancer are needed.""","""['Yaw A Nyame', 'Sarah K Holt', 'Ruth D Etzioni', 'John L Gore']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer""","""['Racial Differences in the Surgical Care of Medicare Beneficiaries With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Racial Disparities in the Presentation, Early Definitive Surgical Treatment, and Mortality Among Men Diagnosed with Poorly Differentiated/Undifferentiated Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer in the USA.', 'The effect of hospital and surgeon volume on racial differences in recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy.', 'Racial disparities in Black men with prostate cancer: A literature review.', 'Ethnic differences in prostate-specific antigen levels in men without prostate cancer: a systematic review.']"""

Cryotherapy, an early method of PGA, has had favorable evaluations, but few studies have employed a strict protocol using biopsy endpoints in men with clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).  Methods:   143 men with unilateral csPCa were enrolled in a prospective, observational trial of outpatient PGA-cryotherapy. Treatment was a 2-cycle freeze of the affected prostate part. Participants were evaluated with MRI-guided biopsy (MRGB) at baseline and at 6 months and 18 months after treatment. Absence of csPCa upon MRGB was the primary endpoint; quality-of-life at baseline and at 6 months after treatment was assessed by EPIC-CP questionnaires in the domains of urinary and sexual function.  Results:   Of the 143 participants, 136 (95%) completed MRGB at 6 months after treatment. In 103/136 (76%), the biopsy revealed no csPCa. Of the 103, 71 subsequently had an 18-month comprehensive biopsy; of the 71 with 18-month biopsies, 46 (65%) were found to have no csPCa. MRI lesions became undetectable in 96/130 (74%); declines in median serum PSA levels (6.9 to 2.5 ng/mL), PSA density (0.15 to 0.07), and prostate volume (42 to 34cc) were observed (all p < 0.01). Neither lesion disappearance on MRI nor PSA decline correlated with biopsy outcome. Urinary function was affected only slightly and sexual function moderately.  Conclusion:   In the near to intermediate term, partial gland ablation with cryotherapy was found to be a safe and moderately effective treatment of intermediate-risk prostate cancer.

Conjugating drugs to substances that target the tumor-induced bone area within the metastatic tumor foci would be a promising strategy for drug delivery. To develop such a strategy, we conjugated a near infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe, the dye Cy5.5, to serve as a surrogate for drugs, with alendronate, which targets bone. Characterization, such as infrared spectroscopy, confirmed the synthesis of the Cy5.5-ALN conjugate. The maximum absorbance of free Cy5.5, which was at 675 nm, did not change upon conjugation. Alendronate targeted the bone component hydroxyapatite in a dose-dependent manner up to 2.5 μM, with a maximum of 85% of Cy5.5-ALN bound to hydroxyapatite, while free Cy5.5 alone had 6% binding. In in vitro cell binding studies, Cy5.5-ALN bound specifically with mineralized bone matrix of differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells or 2H11 endothelial cells that were induced to become osteoblasts through endothelial-to-osteoblast transition, the underlying mechanism of prostate-cancer-induced bone formation. Neither Cy5.5-ALN nor free Cy5.5 bound to undifferentiated MC3T3-E1 or 2H11 cells. Bone-targeting efficiency studies in non-tumor-bearing mice revealed accumulation over time in the spine, jaw, knees, and paws injected with Cy5.5-ALN, and quantification showed higher accumulation in femurs than in muscle at up to 28 days, while the free Cy5.5 dye was observed circulating without preferential accumulation and decreased over time. There was a linear relationship with fluorescence when the injected concentration of Cy5.5-ALN was between 0.313 and 1.25 nmol/27 g of mouse, as quantified in mouse femurs both in vivo and ex vivo. Ex vivo evaluation of bone-targeting efficiency in nude mice was 3 times higher for bone-forming C4-2b-BMP4 tumors compared to non-bone-forming C4-2b tumors (p-value <0.001). Fluorescence microscopy imaging of the tumors showed that Cy5.5-ALN co-localized with the bone matrix surrounding tumor-induced bone, but not with the viable tumor cells. Together, these results suggest that a drug-ALN conjugate is a promising approach for targeted delivery of drug to the tumor-induced bone area in the metastatic foci of prostate cancer.""","""['Jossana A Damasco', 'Guoyu Yu', 'Ajay Kumar', 'Joy Perez', 'Rio Carlo M Lirag', 'Elizabeth M Whitley', 'Sue-Hwa Lin', 'Marites P Melancon']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Dendritic poly(ethylene glycol) bearing paclitaxel and alendronate for targeting bone neoplasms.', 'Poly(ethylene glycol)-paclitaxel-alendronate self-assembled micelles for the targeted treatment of breast cancer bone metastases.', 'Antiangiogenic antitumor activity of HPMA copolymer-paclitaxel-alendronate conjugate on breast cancer bone metastasis mouse model.', 'Cyclo(Cys-Arg-Gly-Asp-Cys)-Gly-Lys-Cy5.5.', 'Cy5.5-Amino-terminal fragment of urokinase-type plasminogen activator conjugated to magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.']"""

We developed and introduced a structure-focused loss (Lstruct) for 3D dose prediction to improve prediction accuracy. This study investigated the influence of Lstruct on DL-based dose prediction for patients with prostate cancer. The proposed Lstruct, which is similar in concept to dose-volume histogram (DVH)-based optimization in clinical practice, has the potential to provide more interpretable and accurate DL-based optimization.  Methods:   This study involved 104 patients who underwent prostate radiotherapy. We used 3D U-Net-based architecture to predict dose distributions from computed tomography and contours of the planning target volume and organs-at-risk. We trained two models using different loss functions: L2 loss and Lstruct. Predicted doses were compared in terms of dose-volume parameters and the Dice similarity coefficient of isodose volume.  Results:   DVH analysis showed that the Lstruct model had smaller errors from the ground truth than the L2 model. The Lstruct model achieved more consistent dose distributions than the L2 model, with errors close to zero. The isodose Dice score of the Lstruct model was greater than that of the L2 model by >20% of the prescribed dose.

This study compares different strategies for automatic segmentation of the prostate in T2-weighted MRIs.  Methods:   This study included 100 patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma who had undergone multi-parametric MRI and prostatectomy. From the T2-weighted MR images, ground truth segmentation masks were established by consensus from two expert radiologists. The prostate was then automatically contoured with six different methods: (1) a multi-atlas algorithm, (2) a proprietary algorithm in the Syngo.Via medical imaging software, and four deep learning models: (3) a V-net trained from scratch, (4) a pre-trained 2D U-net, (5) a GAN extension of the 2D U-net, and (6) a segmentation-adapted EfficientDet architecture. The resulting segmentations were compared and scored against the ground truth masks with one 70/30 and one 50/50 train/test data split. We also analyzed the association between segmentation performance and clinical variables.  Results:   The best performing method was the adapted EfficientDet (model 6), achieving a mean Dice coefficient of 0.914, a mean absolute volume difference of 5.9%, a mean surface distance (MSD) of 1.93 pixels, and a mean 95th percentile Hausdorff distance of 3.77 pixels. The deep learning models were less prone to serious errors (0.854 minimum Dice and 4.02 maximum MSD), and no significant relationship was found between segmentation performance and clinical variables.  Conclusions:   Deep learning-based segmentation techniques can consistently achieve Dice coefficients of 0.9 or above with as few as 50 training patients, regardless of architectural archetype.

Like many other malignancies, urogenital tumors originating from kidney, prostate, testes, and bladder tend to metastasize to the lungs. The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the operative results and prognosis of pulmonary metastasectomy in patients with primary urogenital tumors.  Methods:   This study was approved by the local ethical committee. We retrospectively analyzed the surgical and oncological results of patients who underwent lung resections for urogenital cancer metastases in our department between 2002 and 2018. Demographic data and clinicopathological features were extracted from the medical records. Survival outcomes according to cancer subtypes and early postoperative results of VATS and thoracotomy were analyzed.  Results:   22 out of 126 patients referred for pulmonary metastasectomy to our department had metastases from urogenital tumors. These patients consisted of 17 males and five females. Their metastasis originated from renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n=9), bladder tumor (n=7), testis tumors (n=4), and prostate cancer (n=2). There was no intraoperative complication. Postoperative complications were seen in 2 patients.  Conclusions:   Although pulmonary metastasectomy in various types of tumors is well known and documented, the data is limited for metastases of urogenital cancers in the literature. Despite the limitations of this study, we aim to document our promising results of pulmonary metastasectomy in patients with primary urogenital tumors and wanted to emphasize the role of minimally invasive approaches.""","""['Kenan Can Ceylan', 'Guntug Batıhan', 'Seyda Ors Kaya']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cir Esp (Engl Ed)""","""['Pulmonary and chest wall metastasectomy in urogenital tumors: a single center experience and review of literature.', 'Surgical treatment for pulmonary metastases in urogenital cancers.', 'Surgical approach to pulmonary metastases from breast cancer.', 'Surgical treatment of pulmonary metastases in the Netherlands: data from the Dutch Lung Cancer Audit for Surgery.', 'Prognostic factors for overall survival after lung metastasectomy in renal cell cancer patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Methods:   This prospective cohort study included 401,189 participants in the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010 who were free of cancer and followed up until 2021.

This prodrug is deacetylated in vivo to abiraterone, which is a potent and specific inhibitor of cytochrome P450 17A1 (CYP17A1). CYP17A1 performs two sequential steps that are required for the biosynthesis of androgens that drive prostate cancer proliferation, analogous to estrogens in breast cancer. Abiraterone can be further metabolized in vivo on the steroid A ring to multiple metabolites that also inhibit CYP17A1. Despite its design as an active-site-directed substrate analog, abiraterone and its metabolites demonstrate mixed competitive/noncompetitive inhibition. To understand their binding, we solved the X-ray structures of CYP17A1 with three primary abiraterone metabolites. Despite different conformations of the steroid A ring and substituents, all three bound in the CYP17A1 active site with the steroid core packed against the I helix and the A ring C3 keto or hydroxyl oxygen forming a hydrogen bond with N202 similar to abiraterone itself. The structure of CYP17A1 with 3-keto, 5α-abiraterone was solved to 2.0 Å, the highest resolution to date for a CYP17A1 complex. This structure had additional electron density near the F/G loop, which is likely a second molecule of the inhibitor and which may explain the noncompetitive inhibition. Mutation of the adjacent Asn52 to Tyr positions its side chain in this space, maintains enzyme activity, and prevents binding of the peripheral ligand. Collectively, our findings provide further insight into abiraterone metabolite binding and CYP17A1 function.""","""['Elyse M Petrunak', 'Aaron G Bart', 'Hwei-Ming Peng', 'Richard J Auchus', 'Emily E Scott']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Structures of cytochrome P450 17A1 with prostate cancer drugs abiraterone and TOK-001.', 'Clinical and biochemical consequences of CYP17A1 inhibition with abiraterone given with and without exogenous glucocorticoids in castrate men with advanced prostate cancer.', 'Comparative study of the binding mode between cytochrome P450 17A1 and prostate cancer drugs in the absence of haem iron.', 'The diverse chemistry of cytochrome P450 17A1 (P450c17, CYP17A1).', 'Abiraterone acetate: a novel therapeutic option in hormone-refractory prostate cancer.']"""

Unfortunately, androgen deprivation therapy usually loses its effectivity and the disease frequently progresses into castration-resistant prostate cancer with poor prognosis. The role of the glucocorticoid receptor is associated with the mechanism of resistance; therefore, pharmacological targeting of glucocorticoid receptor in combination with antiandrogen treatment was shown as an alternative approach in the prostate cancer treatment. We introduce here the synthesis of novel 17α- and/or 21-ester or carbamate derivatives of hydrocortisone and evaluation of their biological activity towards androgen and glucocorticoid receptors in different prostate cancer cell lines. A 17α-butyryloxy-21-(alkyl)carbamoyloxy derivative 14 was found to diminish the transcriptional activity of both receptors (in single-digit micromolar range), with comparable potency to enzalutamide towards the androgen receptor, but weaker potency compared to mifepristone towards the glucocorticoid receptor. Lead compound inhibited proliferation and the formation of cell colonies in both androgen and glucocortiocid receptors-positive prostate cancer cell lines in low micromolar concentrations. Candidate compound 14 showed to interact with both receptors in cells and inhibited the translocation of receptors to nucleus and their activation phoshorylation. Moreover, binding to receptor's ligand binding domains was assessed by molecular modelling.

Targeting HSP70 could be a viable strategy to overcome resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitor (ARSI) in advanced prostate cancer.

JG98 also suppressed cell growth in conditional reprogramed cell cultures (CRCs) and organoids derived from advanced prostate cancer patient samples. Mechanistically, JG98 degraded AR/AR-V7 expression in resistant cells and promoted STUB1 nuclear translocation to bind AR-V7. Knockdown of the E3 ligase STUB1 significantly diminished the anticancer effects and partially restored AR-V7 inhibitory effects of JG98.

However, the association between MARCO and patient prognosis, immune infiltration, and ICI immunotherapy needs to be studied urgently.  Methods:   MARCO distribution in cancer tissues was investigated using the TCGA and GTEx databases. The PrognoScan and KM Plotter databases was used to assess the MARCO prognosis. TIMER2.0, GEPIA, cBioPortal, and GSEA all confirmed the link between MARCO and immune infiltration, mutation profile, and enrichment pathway analysis. Data visualization was implemented by R language.  Results:   In general, MARCO had a substantial impact on the prognosis of cancer patients and was expressed differently in cancer and adjacent normal tissues. High expression of MARCO was associated with poorer OS in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), and prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). However, high expression of MARCO had a better PFI in brain lower-grade glioma (LGG) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM). We discovered that MARCO expression was lowest in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) and rectum adenocarcinoma (READ) stage 1, BLCA stage 2, LUSC and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) stage 3, and liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) stage 4. Subsequently, we analyzed the correlation between MARCO and 47 immune checkpoints and observed that MARCO was positively connected with CD80, CD86, and leukocyte-associated immunoglobulin-like receptor 1(LAIR1) in most cancers. In COAD, MARCO has the most microsatellite instability (MSI). In addition, we discovered that high expression of MARCO patients had a better prognosis after immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment in SKCM. Finally, GSEA revealed a significant correlation between MARCO and TNF/NFκB signaling, KRAS signaling, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, IL-6-STAT3 signaling, TGFβ pathway, and p53 pathway.

Summary answer:   As compared to men with no history of cancer, use of assisted reproduction to achieve paternity was more frequent in fathers with a history of cancer, mainly those with testicular, prostate, and hematological and lymphatic malignancies.  What is known already:   Although it is well known that different types of cancer and their treatment may have a negative impact on fertility, there is a lack of data regarding the use of IVF and ICSI among male cancer survivors.  Study design, size, duration:   In this population-based nation-wide study using the Swedish Medical Birth Register, we identified all men who fathered their first-born child in Sweden between 1994 and 2014. Using personal identification numbers, anonymized data from the Swedish National Quality of Assisted Reproduction Register, Swedish Cancer Register, Swedish Multi-generation Register, and Swedish Education Register were linked with the Swedish Medical Birth Register.  Participants/materials, setting, methods:   During the study period, a total of 1 181 488 men fathering their first-born child were identified. Of these, 26 901 fathers had a cancer diagnosis. Fathers diagnosed with cancer with <12 months from offspring conception, or with a cancer diagnosis after offspring conception, were excluded (n = 21 529). The remaining fathers who had a history of cancer (n = 5372) were divided into three groups based on age at cancer diagnosis (<15, ≥15 and <24, or ≥24 years). For subgroup analyses, they were also grouped according to the cancer location using ICD-7 codes. The fathers with no cancer diagnosis (n = 1 154 587), were included as controls. In total, 1 159 959 men were included. Associations between IVF/ICSI use and history of cancer were evaluated using logistic regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for paternal education, fathers age at childbirth, and year of conception, yielding crude and adjusted odds ratio (aOR), respectively, with a 95% CI.  Main results and the role of chance:   As compared to controls, childhood cancer survivors were only more likely to achieve paternity through ICSI (aOR 3.52, 95% CI 2.52-4.93; P < 0.001) but not through IVF treatment (aOR 1.02, 95% CI 0.61-1.70; P = 0.955). Similarly, teenage and young adult cancer survivors were more likely to father through ICSI treatment (aOR 6.84, 95% CI 5.64-8.30; P < 0.001) but not using IVF (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 0.90-1.80; P = 0.17). However, adult cancer survivors were more likely to conceive through either ICSI (aOR 5.52, 95% CI 4.86-6.27; P < 0.001) or IVF treatment (aOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.09-1.60; P = 0.004). In subgroup analyses, childhood survivors of testicular cancer (aOR 5.15, 95% CI 1.20-22.0; P = 0.027), soft tissue and bone cancers (aOR 4.70, 2.13-10.4; P < 0.001), hematological and lymphatic cancers (aOR 4.49, 95% CI 2.72-7.40; P < 0.001), or central nervous system (CNS) and eye cancers (aOR 2.64, 95% CI 1.23-5.67; P = 0.012), were at an increased likelihood of fathering through ICSI. Teenage and young adult survivors of testicular cancer (aOR 15.4, 95% CI 11.5-20.7; P < 0.001), hematological and lymphatic cancers (aOR 9.84, 95% CI 6.93-14.0; P < 0.001), or soft tissue and bone cancers (aOR 6.83, 95% CI 3.53-13.2; P < 0.001) were more likely to father through ICSI treatment. Adult survivors of prostate cancer (aOR 15.7, 95% CI 6.70-36.9; P < 0.001), testicular cancer (aOR 9.54, 95% CI 7.81-11.7; P < 0.001), hematological and lymphatic cancers (aOR 11.3, 95% CI 8.63-14.9; P < 0.001), digestive, respiratory, and urogenital tract cancers (aOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.75-3.92; P < 0.001), CNS and eye cancers (aOR 2.74, 95% CI 1.48-5.08; P = 0.001), or skin cancer (aOR 1.68, 95% CI 1.08-2.62; P = 0.022) were more likely to father through ICSI treatment. Only teenage and young adult survivors of hematological and lymphatic cancers (aOR 1.98, 95% CI 1.10-3.56; P = 0.022) and adult survivors of testicular cancer (aOR 1.88, 95% CI 1.37-2.58; P < 0.001) were significantly more likely to achieve fatherhood using IVF treatment.  Limitations, reasons for caution:   Information on men failing to father children was not available, and thus our results cannot estimate the risk of infertility in men with a history of cancer.  Wider implications of the findings:   Use of ART, in particular ICSI, was significantly more frequent in fathers with malignancies of the male reproductive tract or hematological and lymphatic systems. Our findings highlight which groups of male cancer survivors would benefit from access to fertility care, thereby improving future fertility treatment policies.

However, whether systematic biopsy-guided by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS-SBx) can be omitted when undergoing MRI-TBx in transition zone (TZ) and peripheral zone (PZ) remains unclear.  Purpose:   To assess the performance and effectiveness of MRI-TBx based on PI-RADS v2.1 for csPCa diagnosis in TZ and PZ, respectively.  Study type:   Retrospective.  Subjects:   A total of 309 selected cases (median age 70 years) with 356 lesions who underwent both MRI-TBx and TRUS-SBx were enrolled.  Field strength/sequence:   A 3.0 T, multiparametric MRI (mp-MRI) including T2-weighted turbo-spin echo imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo planar imaging (DWI), dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with time-resolved T1-weighted imaging (DCE).  Assessment:   Mp-MRI was assessed by two radiologists using PI-RADS v2.1. The csPCa detection rates provided by MRI-TBx, TRUS-SBx and combined biopsy in TZ and PZ were calculated, respectively.  Statistical tests:   McNemar test was used to compare the csPCa detection rates in TZ and PZ, respectively. The frequencies and distribution of all detected prostate cancers by different biopsy methods were also compared. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results:   Among 356 lesions in 309 patients, 208 (68 in TZ, 140 in PZ) were pathologically confirmed as csPCa. In TZ, there were significant differences for csPCa detection with PI-RADS 3 between combined biopsy and TRUS-SBx (23.5% vs. 15.3%), MRI-TBx (23.5% vs. 16.3%), respectively. MRI-TBx detected 23% (19/83) cases missed by TRUS-SBx in which 68% (13/19) were csPCa. In PZ, there were no statistical differences between MRI-TBx and combined biopsy with PI-RADS 3-5 (P = 0.21, 0.25, 0.07, respectively). In 9% (14/152) cases only detected by MRI-TBx, 86% (12/14) were clinically significant. Five percent (7/152) of cases only detected by TRUS-SBx were completely nonclinically significant.  Data conclusion:   MRI-TBx played a positive role on csPCa diagnosis in TZ, but combined biopsy might be the best choice especially in the subgroup PI-RADS 3. In PZ, MRI-TBx had an advantage over TRUS-SBx for csPCa detection.  Evidence level:   2.

Natural bioactive compounds have drawn the interest of researchers worldwide in their efforts to find novel treatments for PC. Many of these bioactive compounds have been identified from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedies often containing multiple bioactive compounds. However, in vitro studies frequently focus on the compounds in isolation.  Aim:   We used mixture design response surface methodology (MDRSM) to assess changes in PC cell viability after 48 h of treatment to identify the optimal mixture of all 35 three-compound combinations of seven bioactive compounds from TCM.  Methods and results:   We used berberine, wogonin, shikonin, curcumin, triptolide, emodin, and silybin to treat PC3 and LNCaP human PC cells at their IC50 concentrations that we calculated. These compounds modulate many chemotherapeutic pathways including intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis, increasing reactive oxygen species, decreasing metastatic pathways, inhibiting cell cycle progression. We hypothesize that because these compounds bind to unique molecular targets to activate different chemotherapeutic pathways, they will act synergistically to decrease tumor cell viability. Results from MDRSM showed that two-way combinations were more effective than three-way or single compounds. Most notably wogonin, silybin, emodin and berberine responded well in two-compound combinations with each other in PC3 and LNCaP cells. We then conducted cell viability tests combining two bioactive compound ratios with docetaxel (Doc) and found significant results within the LNCaP cell line. In particular, mixtures of berberine and wogonin, berberine and silybin, emodin and berberine, and emodin and silybin reduced LNCaP cell viability up to an average of 90.02%. The two-compound combinations were significantly better than docetaxel treatment of LNCaP cells.  Conclusion:   Within the PC3 cells, we show that a combination of berberine, wogonin and docetaxel is just as effective as docetaxel alone. Thus, we provide new combination treatments that are highly effective in vitro for treating androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PC.""","""['Ian Geddes Berlin', 'Charity Conlin Jennings', 'Spencer Shin', 'Jason Kenealey']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""['Application of Mixture Design Response Surface Methodology for Combination Chemotherapy in PC-3 Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'γ-Tocotrienol and α-Tocopherol Ether Acetate Enhance Docetaxel Activity in Drug-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Berberine, a natural product, induces G1-phase cell cycle arrest and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis in human prostate carcinoma cells.', 'Targeting apoptosis pathways in cancer by Chinese medicine.', 'Naturally occurring anti-cancer compounds: shining from Chinese herbal medicine.']"""

Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of AOS in BPH by using human benign prostatic epithelial cells (BPH-1) and a rat model of testosterone-induced BPH. Treatment with AOS inhibited in vitro and in vivo proliferation of prostatic epithelial cells and the testosterone-induced expression of androgen receptor (AR) and androgen-associated genes, such as those encoding 5α-reductase type 2 and prostate-specific antigen.

Only for lung cancer was the association significant. In the case of pancreatic cancer, a possible type 1 error was present due to a low number of cancers. In cases of breast and prostate cancer, no association and no dose response were demonstrated. The association seen for lung and pancreatic cancer parallels that earlier demonstrated for large bowel cancer and indicates a cancer-protective effect from daily intake of raw carrots not limited to gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. Processed carrots exhibited no effect. The preventive effect could be due to the polyacetylenic compounds falcarinol and falcarindiol in carrots, whereas carotene may not have an effect. The polyacetylenes are inactivated by heating, supporting our findings that only raw carrot intake has an effect.

Preliminary studies revealed that pseurotin A (PsA), a spiro-heterocyclic γ-lactam alkaloid from several marine and terrestrial Aspergillus and Penicillium species, has the ability to dually suppress the PCSK9 expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) with LDLR, resulting in an anti-hypercholesterolemic effect and modulating the oncogenic role of PCSK9 axis in breast and prostate cancers progression and recurrence. Thus, a preliminary assessment of the PsA acute toxicity represents the steppingstone to develop PsA as a novel orally active PCSK9 axis modulating cancer recurrence inhibitor. PsA studies for in vitro toxicity on RWPE-1 and CCD 841 CoN human non-tumorigenic prostate and colon cells, respectively, indicated a cellular death shown at a 10-fold level of its reported anticancer activity. Moreover, a Western blot analysis revealed a significant downregulation of the pro-survival marker Bcl-2, along with the upregulation of the proapoptotic Bax and caspases 3/7, suggesting PsA-mediated induction of cell apoptosis at very high concentrations. The Up-and-Down methodology determined the PsA LD50 value of >550 mg/kg in male and female Swiss albino mice. Animals were orally administered single doses of PsA at 10, 250, and 500 mg/kg by oral gavage versus vehicle control. Mice were observed daily for 14 days with special care over the first 24 h after dosing to monitor any abnormalities in their behavioral, neuromuscular, and autonomic responses. After 14 days, the mice were euthanized, and their body and organ weights were recorded and collected. Mice plasma samples were subjected to comprehensive hematological and biochemical analyses. Collected mouse organs were histopathologically examined. No morbidity was detected following the PsA oral dosing. The 500 mg/kg female dosing group showed a 45% decrease in the body weight after 14 days but displayed no other signs of toxicity. The 250 mg/kg female dosing group had significantly increased serum levels of liver transaminases AST and ALT versus vehicle control. Moreover, a modest upregulation of apoptotic markers was observed in liver tissues of both animal sexes at 500 mg/kg dose level. However, a histopathological examination revealed no damage to the liver, kidneys, heart, brain, or lungs. While these findings suggest a possible sex-related toxicity at higher doses, the lack of histopathological injury implies that single oral doses of PsA, up to 50-fold the therapeutic dose, do not cause acute organ toxicity in mice though further studies are warranted.""","""['Oliver C McGehee', 'Hassan Y Ebrahim', 'Ashkan H Rad', 'Khaldoun S Abdelwahed', 'Ethar A Mudhish', 'Judy A King', 'Iman E Helal', 'Sharon A Meyer', 'Khalid A El Sayed']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Pseurotin A Validation as a Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Recurrence-Suppressing Lead via PCSK9-LDLR Axis Modulation.', 'Pseurotin A as a novel suppressor of hormone dependent breast cancer progression and recurrence by inhibiting PCSK9 secretion and interaction with LDL receptor.', 'Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 deficiency reduces melanoma metastasis in liver.', 'Targeting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.', 'Antitumor activity and molecular mechanism of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibition.', 'Pseurotin A Validation as a Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Recurrence-Suppressing Lead via PCSK9-LDLR Axis Modulation.']"""

As we know, nuclear receptor Nur77 is important in cancer development and changes in the tumor microenvironment; whereas, the function of Nur77 in PRAD remains to be elucidated. The TCGA database was used to explore the Nur77 expression and its role in the prognosis of PRAD. It was shown that Nur77 was down regulated in PRAD, and low Nur77 expression was correlated with advanced clinical pathologic characteristics (high grade, histological type, age) and poor prognosis. Furthermore, key genes screening was examined by univariate Cox analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival. Additionally, Nur77 was closely related to immune infiltration and some anti-tumor immune functions. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were presented by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Therefore, the expression level of Nur77 might help predict the survival of PRAD cases, which presents a new insight and a new target for the treatment of PRAD. In vitro experiments verified that natural product malayoside targeting Nur77 exhibited significant therapeutic effects on PRAD and largely induced cell apoptosis by up-regulating the expression of Nur77 and its mitochondrial localization.

However, in some cases, the indolent form can transform into aggressive metastatic incurable cancer. The most important task of PCa diagnostics is to search for early markers that can be used for predicting the transition of indolent cancer into its aggressive form. Currently, there are two effective preclinical models to study PCa pathogenesis: patients derived xenografts (PDXs) and patients derived organoids (PDOs). Both models have limitations that restrict their use in research. In this work, we investigated the ability of the primary 2D prostate cell cultures (PCCs) from PCa patients to express epithelial and cancer markers. Early PCCs were formed by epithelial cells that were progressively replaced with the fibroblast-like cells. Early PCCs contained tissue-specific stem cells that could grow in a 3D culture and form PDOs similar to those produced from the prostate tissue. Early PCCs and PDOs derived from the tissues of PCa patients expressed prostate basal and luminal epithelial markers, as well as cancer markers AMACR, TMPRSS2-ERG, and EZH2, the latter being a promising candidate to mark the transition from the indolent to aggressive PCa. We also identified various TMPRSS2-ERG fusion transcripts in PCCs and PDOs, including new chimeric variants resulting from the intra- and interchromosomal translocations.

This highlights the importance of identifying functional genomic variants for early detection in high-risk PC individuals. Great efforts have been made to identify common protein-coding genetic variations; however, the impact of non-coding variations, including regulatory genetic variants, is not well understood. Identification of these variants and the underlying target genes will be a key step in improving the detection and treatment of PC. To gain an understanding of the functional impact of genetic variants, and in particular, regulatory variants in PC, we developed an integrative pipeline (AGV) that uses whole genome/exome sequences, GWAS SNPs, chromosome conformation capture data, and ChIP-Seq signals to investigate the potential impact of genomic variants on the underlying target genes in PC. We identified 646 putative regulatory variants, of which 30 significantly altered the expression of at least one protein-coding gene. Our analysis of chromatin interactions data (Hi-C) revealed that the 30 putative regulatory variants could affect 131 coding and non-coding genes. Interestingly, our study identified the 131 protein-coding genes that are involved in disease-related pathways, including Reactome and MSigDB, for most of which targeted treatment options are currently available. Notably, our analysis revealed several non-coding RNAs, including RP11-136K7.2 and RAMP2-AS1, as potential enhancer elements of the protein-coding genes CDH12 and EZH1, respectively.

Progression implies the emergence of cells proliferating in the absence of androgen through still elusive mechanisms. We show here for the first time that ADT induces LNCaP mHSPC cells to collectively enter a metastable quasi-apoptotic state (QUAPS) consisting of partial mitochondrial permeabilization, limited BAX and caspase activation, and moderate induction of caspase-dependent dsDNA breaks; despite this, cells maintain full viability. QUAPS is destabilized by poly(ADP)-polymerase inhibition (PARPi), breaking off toward overt intrinsic apoptosis and culture extinction. Instead, QUAPS is rapidly and efficiently reverted upon androgen restoration, with mitochondria rapidly recovering integrity and cells collectively resuming normal proliferation. Notably, replication restarts before DNA repair is completed, and implies an increased micronuclei frequency, indicating that ADT promotes genetic instability. The recovered cells re-acquire insensitivity to PARPi (as untreated LNCaP), pointing to specific, context-dependent vulnerability of mHSPC cells to PARPi during ADT. Summarizing, QUAPS is an unstable, pro-mutagenic state developing as a pro-survival pathway stabilized by PARP, and constitutes a novel viewpoint explaining how ADT-treated mHSPC may progress to CRPC, indicating possible preventive countermeasures.""","""['Andrea Pelliccia', 'Francesco Capradossi', 'Francesca Corsi', 'Greta Deidda Tarquini', 'Emanuele Bruni', 'Albrecht Reichle', 'Francesco Torino', 'Lina Ghibelli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['New treatment approaches for and ongoing trials in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Benzyldihydroxyoctenone, a novel nonsteroidal antiandrogen, shows differential apoptotic induction in prostate cancer cells in response to their androgen responsiveness.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

First, 4195 protein-coding genes (PCGs, mRNAs) were obtained from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, in which 1148 lncRNAs were differentially expressed in PCa. Then, 44,270 pairs of co-expression relationships were calculated between 612 lncRNAs and 2742 mRNAs, of which 42,596 (96%) were positively correlated. Among the 612 lncRNAs, 392 had the potential to interact with the promoter region to form DNA:DNA:RNA triplexes, from which lncRNA AD000684.2(AC002128.1) was selected for further validation. AC002128.1 was highly expressed in PCa. Furthermore, AD000684.2 positively regulated the expression of the correlated genes.

Hesperetin is a citrus bioflavonoid known to inhibit TGFβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion of prostate cancer cells. Targeting epigenetic modifications that cause cancer is another class of upcoming therapeutics, as these changes are reversible. Global H3K27me3 levels have been found to be reduced in invasive prostate adenocarcinomas. Combining a demethylase inhibitor and a known anti-cancer phytochemical is a unique approach to targeting cancer to attain the aforementioned objectives. In the current study, we used an H3K27 demethylase (JMJD3/KDM6B) inhibitor to study its effects on TGFβ-induced EMT in prostate cancer cells. We then gave a combined hesperetin and GSK-J4 treatment to the PC-3 and LNCaP cells. There was a dose-dependent increase in cytotoxicity and inhibition of TGFβ-induced migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells after GSK-J4 treatment. GSK-J4 not only induced trimethylation of H3K27 but also induced the trimethylation of H3K4. Surprisingly, there was a reduction in the H3K9me3 levels.

Due to their heterogeneity, different isolation methods may enrich distinct exosome cargos generating different omic profiles. In this study, we evaluated the effects of plasma exosome isolation methods on detectable multi-omic profiles in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and healthy controls, and developed an algorithm to quantify exosome enrichment. Plasma exosomes were isolated from CRPC (n = 10), NSCLC (n = 14), and healthy controls (n = 10) using three different methods: size exclusion chromatography (SEC), lectin binding, and T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-containing protein 4 (TIM4) binding. Molecular profiles were determined by mass spectrometry of extracted exosome fractions. Enrichment analysis of uniquely detected molecules was performed for each method with MetaboAnalyst. The exosome enrichment index (EEI) scores methods based on top differential molecules between patient groups. The lipidomic analysis detected 949 lipids using exosomes from SEC, followed by 246 from lectin binding and 226 from TIM4 binding. The detectable metabolites showed SEC identifying 191 while lectin binding and TIM4 binding identified 100 and 107, respectively. When comparing uniquely detected molecules, different methods showed preferential enrichment of different sets of molecules with SEC enriching the greatest diversity. Compared to controls, SEC identified 28 lipids showing significant difference in NSCLC, while only 1 metabolite in NSCLC and 5 metabolites in CRPC were considered statistically significant (FDR < 0.1). Neither lectin-binding- nor TIM4-binding-derived exosome lipids or metabolites demonstrated significant differences between patient groups. We observed the highest EEI from SEC in lipids (NSCLC: 871.33) which was also noted in metabolites. These results support that the size exclusion method of exosome extraction implemented by SBI captures more heterogeneous exosome populations. In contrast, lectin-binding and TIM4-binding methods bind surface glycans or phosphatidylserine moieties of the exosomes. Overall, these findings suggest that specific isolation methods select subpopulations which may significantly impact cancer biomarker discovery.""","""['Alex C Soupir', 'Yijun Tian', 'Paul A Stewart', 'Yury O Nunez-Lopez', 'Brandon J Manley', 'Bruna Pellini', 'Amanda M Bloomer', 'Jingsong Zhang', 'Qianxing Mo', 'Douglas C Marchion', 'Min Liu', 'John M Koomen', 'Erin M Siegel', 'Liang Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Alterations of plasma exosomal proteins and motabolies are associated with the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Size Dependent Lipidomic Analysis of Urinary Exosomes from Patients with Prostate Cancer by Flow Field-Flow Fractionation and Nanoflow Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.', 'Prospective exosome-focused translational research for afatinib study of non-small cell lung cancer patients expressing EGFR (EXTRA study).', 'Exosome detection via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for cancer diagnosis.', 'Exosome-based liquid biopsies in cancer: opportunities and challenges.']"""

In particular, its contribution to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in this setting has not been well studied. Therefore, this paper profiles the expression of miR-182 in prostate cancer and investigates how it may contribute to progression of this disease. In vitro experiments on prostate cancer cell lines and in silico analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) datasets were performed. PCR revealed miR-182 expression was significantly increased in prostate cancer cell lines compared to normal prostate cells. Bioinformatic analysis of TCGA PRAD data similarly showed upregulation of miR-182 was significantly associated with prostate cancer and clinical markers of disease progression. Functional enrichment analysis confirmed a significant association of miR-182 and its target genes with EMT. The EMT-linked gene MITF (melanocyte inducing transcription factor) was subsequently shown to be a novel target of miR-182 in prostate cancer cells. Further TCGA analysis suggested miR-182 expression can be an indicator of patient outcomes and disease progression following therapy. In summary, this is the first study to report that miR-182 over-expression in prostate cancer may contribute to EMT by targeting MITF expression.

However, the thermal effects of FUS are known to lead to various biological effects, such as inhibition of repair of DNA damage, reduction in tumor hypoxia, and induction of apoptosis. Here, we studied radiosensitization as a combination therapy of FUS and RT in a xenograft mouse model using newly developed MRI-compatible FUS equipment. Xenograft tumor-bearing mice were produced by subcutaneous injection of the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3. Animals were treated with FUS in 7 T MRI at 4.8 W/cm2 to reach ~45 °C and held for 30 min. The temperature was controlled via fiber optics and proton resonance frequency shift (PRF) MR thermometry in parallel. In the combination group, animals were treated with FUS followed by X-ray at a single dose of 10 Gy. The effects of FUS and RT were assessed via hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining. Tumor proliferation was detected by the immunohistochemistry of Ki67 and apoptosis was measured by a TUNEL assay. At 40 days follow-up, the impact of RT on cancer cells was significantly improved by FUS as demonstrated by a reduction in cell nucleoli from 189 to 237 compared to RT alone. Inhibition of tumor growth by 4.6 times was observed in vivo in the FUS + RT group (85.3%) in contrast to the tumor volume of 393% in the untreated control.

Growing evidence suggests that chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells with stem-like properties (CSC) may repopulate the tumor. The androgen receptor (AR) is expressed in up to 50% of TNBCs, and AR inhibition decreases CSC and tumor initiation. Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) correlates with poor prognosis in TNBC and is regulated by the AR in prostate cancer. Our group has shown that RUNX1 promotes TNBC cell migration and regulates tumor gene expression. We hypothesized that RUNX1 is regulated by the AR and that both may work together in TNBC CSC to promote disease recurrence following chemotherapy. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in MDA-MB-453 revealed AR binding to RUNX1 regulatory regions. RUNX1 expression is upregulated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in MDA-MB-453 and in an AR+-TNBC HCI-009 patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumors (p < 0.05). RUNX1 is increased in a CSC-like experimental model in MDA-MB-453 and SUM-159PT cells (p < 0.05). Inhibition of RUNX1 transcriptional activity reduced the expression of CSC markers. Interestingly, RUNX1 inhibition reduced cell viability and enhanced paclitaxel and enzalutamide sensitivity.

Study design:   A descriptive study.  Place and duration of study:   Department of Urology, Bolu Abant Izzet Baysal University, Bolu, Turkey, from January 2017 to December 2021.  Methodology:   The data of 135 patients, who underwent radical prostatectomy for low-risk prostate cancer according to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, biopsy result and clinical stage, were analysed. Preoperative clinicopathological factors, MRI findings, and the final pathological results were analysed. Prognostic factors affecting the biochemical recurrence in the follow-up and tumour upgrade in the final pathology according to the International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) were evaluated.  Results:   Mean age and preoperative PSA level were 61.37 ± 5.53 (46-74) years and 6.74 ± 1.97 (range 1.88-9.9) ng/dL, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that the prostate volume and diameter of lesions were statistically significant in the patients with ISUP upgrade (p=0.006, p=0.025, respectively), and surgical margin positivity in the final pathology specimen was statistically significant for biochemical recurrence (p=0.016). Logistic regression analysis revealed that prostate volume and diameter of the lesion in MRI were independent predictors of ISUP score upgrade. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that tumour size on the MRI had 49.4% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity at 10 mm (AUC:0.634, p=0.009 for predicting).  Conclusion:   Lower prostate volume, higher diameter of lesions in multiparametric MRI and surgical margin positivity were associated factors affecting the ISUP score upgrade and biochemical recurrence.

Patients and methods:   The 177 Lutetium-PSMA Neoadjuvant to Ablative Radiotherapy for Oligorecurrent Prostate Cancer (LUNAR) trial is an open-label, randomized, stratified, two-arm, single-centre, Phase 2 trial to compare the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant 177 Lu-PNT2002 plus SBRT vs SBRT alone in men with oligorecurrent mHSPC. Key eligibility criteria include one to five lesions identified on a PSMA positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan centrally reviewed by a board-certified nuclear medicine physician. Key exclusion criteria include castrate-resistant disease, de novo oligometastatic disease and receipt of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) within 6 months of trial enrolment. The trial aims to enrol 100 patients who will be centrally randomized to one of the two treatment arms, in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the control arm receive SBRT to all sites of disease. Patients in the experimental arm receive two cycles of neoadjuvant 177 Lu-PNT2002 (6.8 GBq) 6-8 weeks apart, followed by an interval PSMA PET/CT in 4-6 weeks and dose-adapted SBRT to all sites of disease 1-2 weeks later. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints are radiographic and prostate-specific antigen-based progression, acute and late physician-scored toxicity, patient-reported quality of life, ADT-free survival, time to progression, overall survival, locoregional control, and duration of response.

Aim:   The aims of this study were to (1) describe the clinical symptoms of painful receptive anal intercourse (RAI) in GBM following PCa treatment, (2) estimate the prevalence of anodyspareunia, and (3) identify clinical and psychosocial correlates.  Methods:   This was a secondary analysis of baseline and 24-month follow-up data from the Restore-2 randomized clinical trial of 401 GBM treated for PCa. The analytic sample included only those participants who attempted RAI during or since their PCa treatment (N = 195).  Outcomes:   Anodyspareunia was operationalized as moderate to severe pain during RAI for ≥6 months that resulted in mild to severe distress. Additional quality-of-life outcomes included the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (bowel function and bother subscales), the Brief Symptom Inventory-18, and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate.  Results:   Overall 82 (42.1%) participants reported pain during RAI since completing PCa treatment. Of these, 45.1% experienced painful RAI sometimes or frequently, and 63.0% indicated that the pain was persistent. The pain at its worst was moderate to very severe for 79.0%. The experience of pain was at least mildly distressing for 63.5%. Painful RAI worsened for a third (33.4%) of participants after completing PCa treatment. Of the 82 GBM, 15.4% were classified as meeting criteria for anodyspareunia. Antecedents of anodyspareunia included a lifelong history of painful RAI and bowel dysfunction following PCa treatment. Those reporting symptoms of anodyspareunia were more likely to avoid RAI due to pain (adjusted odds ratio, 4.37), which was negatively associated with sexual satisfaction (mean difference, -2.77) and self-esteem (mean difference, -3.33). The model explained 37.2% of the variance in overall quality of life.  Clinical implications:   Culturally responsive PCa care should include the assessment of anodyspareunia among GBM and explore treatment options.  Strengths and limitations:   This is the largest study to date focused on anodyspareunia among GBM treated for PCa. Anodyspareunia was assessed with multiple items characterizing the intensity, duration, and distress related to painful RAI. The external validity of the findings is limited by the nonprobability sample. Furthermore, the cause-and-effect relationships between the reported associations cannot be established by the research design.  Conclusions:   Anodyspareunia should be considered a sexual dysfunction in GBM and investigated as an adverse outcome of PCa treatment.""","""['Christopher W Wheldon', 'Alex J Bates', 'Elizabeth J Polter', 'B R Simon Rosser', 'Aditya Kapoor', 'Kristine M C Talley', 'Ryan Haggart', 'Nidhi Kohli', 'Badrinath R Konety', 'Darryl Mitteldorf', 'Michael W Ross', 'William West', 'Morgan Wright']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Pain and Loss of Pleasure in Receptive Anal Sex for Gay and Bisexual Men following Prostate Cancer Treatment: Results from the Restore-1 Study.', 'Sexual Anal Pain in Gay and Bisexual Men: In Search of Explanatory Factors.', 'The Sexual Functioning of Gay and Bisexual Men Following Prostate Cancer Treatment: Results from the Restore Study.', 'Sexual Dysfunction in Men Who Have Sex With Men.', 'Sex After Prostate Cancer in Gay and Bisexual Men: A Review of the Literature.']"""

Methods:   This study included 76 prostatic cancers with histological mapping. The examined characteristics from the histological mappings were the largest tumor dimension, distance from the tumor core to resection margin, tumor dimension from the apex to base, tumor volume, tumor surface area, and proportion of the tumor. In addition, these histological parameters from the histological mapping were compared between patients with positive surgical margin (PSM) and negative surgical margin (NSM).  Results:   Patients with PSM were significantly correlated with a higher Gleason score and pT stage than those with NSM. Among the histological characteristics from mappings, there were significant correlations between PSM and the largest tumor dimension, tumor volume, tumor surface area, and proportion of tumor (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.017, respectively). The distance from the tumor core to the resection margin was significantly longer with PSM than with NSM (P = 0.024).

We examined efficacy and safety from the ARASENS trial for subgroups by disease volume and risk.  Methods:   Patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer were randomly assigned to darolutamide or placebo plus androgen-deprivation therapy and docetaxel. High-volume disease was defined as visceral metastases and/or ≥ 4 bone metastases with ≥ 1 beyond the vertebral column/pelvis. High-risk disease was defined as ≥ 2 risk factors: Gleason score ≥ 8, ≥ 3 bone lesions, and presence of measurable visceral metastases.  Results:   Of 1,305 patients, 1,005 (77%) had high-volume disease and 912 (70%) had high-risk disease. Darolutamide increased overall survival (OS) versus placebo in patients with high-volume (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.82), high-risk (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.86), and low-risk disease (HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.90), and in the smaller low-volume subgroup, the results were also suggestive of survival benefit (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41 to 1.13). Darolutamide improved clinically relevant secondary end points of time to castration-resistant prostate cancer and subsequent systemic antineoplastic therapy versus placebo in all disease volume and risk subgroups. Adverse events (AEs) were similar between treatment groups across subgroups. Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 64.9% of darolutamide patients versus 64.2% of placebo patients in the high-volume subgroup and 70.1% versus 61.1% in the low-volume subgroup. Among the most common AEs, many were known toxicities related to docetaxel.

However, since herbal medicine has multi-components, multi-targets and multi-pathways features, its underlying molecular mechanism of action is not yet known and still needs to be systematically explored. Presently, a comprehensive approach consisting of bibliometric analysis, pharmacokinetic assessment, target prediction and network construction is firstly performed to obtain PCa-related herbal medicines and their corresponding candidate compounds and potential targets. Subsequently, a total of 20 overlapping genes between DEGs in PCa patients and the target genes of the PCa-related herbs, as well as five hub genes, i.e., CCNA2, CDK2, CTH, DPP4 and SRC were determined employing bioinformatics analysis. Further, the roles of these hub genes in PCa were also investigated through survival analysis and tumour immunity analysis. Moreover, to validate the reliability of the C-T interactions and to further explore the binding modes between ingredients and their targets, the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out. Finally, based on the modularization of the biological network, four signaling pathways, i.e., PI3K-Akt, MAPK, p53 and cell cycle were integrated to further analyze the therapeutic mechanism of PCa-related herbal medicine.

CCN proteins act to facilitate signaling events involving extracellular matrix proteins. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a lipid that activates G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), enhancing proliferation, adhesion, and migration in many types of cancer cells. Our group previously reported that LPA induces production of CCN1 protein in human prostate cancer cell lines within 2-4 h. In these cells, the mitogenic activity of LPA is mediated by LPA Receptor 1 (LPAR1), a GPCR. There are multiple examples of the induction of CCN proteins by LPA, and by the related lipid mediator sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), in various cellular models. The signaling pathways responsible for LPA/S1P-induced CCN1/2 typically involve activation of the small GTP-binding protein Rho and the transcription factor YAP. Inducible CCNs can potentially play roles in downstream signal transduction events required for LPA and S1P-induced responses. Specifically, CCNs secreted into the extracellular space can facilitate the activation of additional receptors and signal transduction pathways, contributing to the biphasic delayed responses typically seen in response to growth factors acting via GPCRs. In some model systems, CCN1 and CCN2 play key roles in LPA/S1P-induced cell migration and proliferation. In this way, an extracellular signal (LPA or S1P) can activate GPCR-mediated intracellular signaling to induce the production of extracellular modulators (CCN1 and CCN2) that in turn initiate another round of intracellular signaling.""","""['Pravita Balijepalli', 'Kathryn E Meier']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cell Commun Signal""","""['Signal transduction responses to lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine 1-phosphate in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Induction of the matricellular protein CCN1 through RhoA and MRTF-A contributes to ischemic cardioprotection.', 'CCN2 Mediates S1P-Induced Upregulation of COX2 Expression in Human Granulosa-Lutein Cells.', 'Diversity of cellular receptors and functions for the lysophospholipid growth factors lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine 1-phosphate.', 'Signaling mechanisms and molecular characteristics of G protein-coupled receptors for lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine 1-phosphate.']"""

However, the inflammatory process caused by the device usually displaces the prostate's anatomical landmarks and challenges surgeons performing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). In this video, we will illustrate several technical challenges in patients with Urolift ® who underwent RARP.  Material and methods:   We performed a video compilation with several surgical steps illustrating key aspects and critical details of the anterior bladder neck access, lateral bladder dissection from the prostate, and posterior prostate dissection to avoid ureteral and neural bundles injuries.  Results:   We perform our RARP technique with our standard approach in all patients (2-6). The beginning of the case is performed like every patient with an enlarged prostate. We first identify the anterior bladder neck and then complete its dissection with Maryland and Scissors. However, extra care must be taken in the anterior and posterior bladder neck approach due to the clips found during the dissection. The challenge starts when opening the lateral sides of the bladder until the base of the prostate. It is crucial to perform the bladder neck dissection beginning at the internal plane of the bladder wall. Such dissection is the easiest way to recognize the anatomical landmarks and potential foreign materials, such as clips, placed during previous surgeries. We cautiously work around the clip to avoid using cautery on the top of the metal clips because energy is transmitted from one edge to the other of the Urolift ®. This can be dangerous if the edge of the clip is close to the ureteral orifices. The clips are usually removed to minimize cautery conduction energy. Finally, after isolating and removing the clips, the prostate dissection and subsequent surgical steps are continued with our conventional technique. Before proceeding, we ensure that all clips are removed from the bladder neck to avoid complications during the anastomosis.  Conclusions:   Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy in patients with Urolift ® is challenging due to modified anatomical landmarks and intense inflammatory processes in the posterior bladder neck. When dissecting the clips placed next to the base of the prostate, it is crucial to avoid cautery because energy conduction to the other edge of the Urolift ® can cause thermal damage to the ureters and neural bundles.""","""['Marcio Covas Moschovas', 'David Grant Loy', 'Abdel Jaber', 'Shady Saikali', 'Travis Rogers', 'Sarah Kind', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int Braz J Urol""","""['Different approaches for bladder neck dissection during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: the Aalst technique.', 'Nerve-sparing robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: how I do it after 15.000 cases.', 'Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy after Previous Bladder Outlet Surgery: A Systematic Review and Pooled Analysis of Comparative Studies.', 'Bladder Neck Contracture with Hem-o-Lok Clips Migration after Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: A Case Report and Literature Review.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   In this study, we investigated the association of 222 haplotype-tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight phospholipid-transporting ATPase genes with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) of 630 patients treated with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer.  Results:   After multivariate Cox regression analysis and multiple testing correction, we found that ATP8B1 rs7239484 was remarkably associated with CSS and OS after ADT. A pooled analysis of multiple independent gene-expression datasets demonstrated that ATP8B1 was under-expressed in tumor tissues and that a higher ATP8B1 expression was associated with a better patient prognosis.

Patients with recurrent disease initially respond to androgen-deprivation therapy, but the tumor eventually progresses into castration-resistant PCa. Thus, new therapeutic approaches for PCa resistance to current treatments are urgently needed. Here, we report that cardiac glycoside neriifolin suppresses the malignancy of cancer cells via increasing DNA damage and apoptosis through activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in prostate cancers. We found that cardiac glycoside neriifolin markedly inhibited the cell growth and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Transcriptome sequence analysis revealed that neriifolin significantly induced DNA damage and double strand breaks (DSBs), validated with attenuation expression of genes in DSBs repair and increasing phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) foci formation, a quantitative marker of DSBs. Moreover, we found that neriifolin also activated ERS, evidenced by upregulation and activation of ERS related proteins, including eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) as well as downregulation of CCAATenhancerbinding protein alpha (C/EBP-α), a transcriptional factor that forms heterodimers with CHOP. In addition, neriifolin treatment dramatically inhibited the by tumor growth, which were reversed by CHOP loss or overexpression of C/EBP-α in nude mice. Mechanistically, neriifolin suppressed the tumor growth by increasing DNA damage and apoptosis through CHOP-C/EBP-α signaling axis of ERS in prostate cancers.

We sought to evaluate the association between gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists versus GnRH antagonist and the risk of CVD in patients with prostate cancer with or without prior CVD.  Patients and methods:   Using administrative databases from Quebec, Canada, we identified first-time GnRH agonists and antagonist (degarelix) users between January 2012 and June 2016. Follow-up ended at the earliest of the following: first CVD event (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, ischemic heart disease [IHD], arrhythmia, and heart failure [HF]); switch of GnRH group; death; or December 31, 2016. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on the propensity score was used to control for potential confounding. IPTW-Cox proportional hazards model accounting for competing risks was used to evaluate the association of interest.  Results:   Among 10,785 patients identified, 10,201 and 584 were on GnRH agonists and antagonist, respectively. Median age was 75 years (interquartile range, 69-81 years) for both groups. A total of 4,152 (40.7%) men in the GnRH agonists group and 281 (48.1%) men in the GnRH antagonist group had CVD in the 3-year period prior to ADT initiation. Risk of HF was decreased in the antagonist group compared with the GnRH agonist group among patients with prior CVD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.79). Risk of IHD was decreased in the antagonist group in patients without prior CVD (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.11-0.65).

However, no bone metastases have yet been treated. In this study, the efficacy of NIR-PIT for bone metastases was investigated using a bone metastases mouse model successfully established by caudal artery injection of a human triple-negative breast cancer cell line, MDAMB468-GFP/luc. The bone metastatic lesions were treated with NIR-PIT using the anti-EGFR antibody, panitumumab-IR700 conjugate. Bioluminescence imaging and histological evaluation showed that EGFR-targeted NIR-PIT has a therapeutic effect on bone metastatic lesions in mice.

This technique is made possible by placing rotating metallic shields inside brachytherapy needles or catheters. By dynamically directing the radiation towards the tumours and away from the healthy tissues, a more conformal dose distribution can be obtained. The resulting treatment planning involves optimizing dwell position and shield angle (DPSA). The aim of this study was to investigate the column generation method for IMBT treatment plan optimization.Approach.A column generation optimization algorithm was developed to optimize the dwell times and shield angles. A retrospective study was performed on 10 prostate cases using RapidBrachyMCTPS. At every iteration, the plan was optimized with the chosen DPSA which would best improve the cost function that was added to the plan. The optimization process was stopped when the remaining DPSAs would not add value to the plan to limit the plan complexity.Main results.The average number of DPSAs and voxels were 2270 and 7997, respectively. The column generation approach yielded near-optimal treatment plans by using only 11% of available DPSAs on average in ten prostate cases. The coverage and organs at risk constraints passed in all ten cases.Significance.The column generation method produced high-quality deliverable prostate IMBT plans. The treatment plan quality reached a plateau, where adding more DPSAs had a minimal effect on dose volume histogram parameters. The iterative nature of the column generation method allows early termination of the treatment plan creation process as soon as the dosimetric indices from dose volume histogram satisfy the clinical requirements or if their values stabilize.""","""['Majd Antaki', 'Marc-André Renaud', 'Marc Morcos', 'Jan Seuntjens', 'Shirin A Enger']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Three dimensional intensity modulated brachytherapy (IMBT): dosimetry algorithm and inverse treatment planning.', 'A novel 169 Yb-based dynamic-shield intensity modulated brachytherapy delivery system for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric impact of a robust optimization approach to mitigate effects from rotational uncertainty in prostate intensity-modulated brachytherapy.', 'Integration of rotatable tandem applicator to conventional ovoid applicator toward complete framework of intensity modulated brachytherapy (IMBT) for cervical cancer.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.']"""

Mortality patterns for some groups, including Black individuals, are not as well known. The objective of this study was to assess cause-specific mortality for Black adults living in Canada.  Methods:   Mortality inequalities between Black and White cohort members were estimated by sex using Cox proportional hazard models, based on data from the 2001, 2006 and 2011 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHECs). The CanCHEC cycles were combined and followed for mortality between Census Day and December 31, 2016 or 2019, resulting in a follow-up period of 15.6, 13.6 or 8.6 years, depending on the CanCHEC cycle.  Results:   Ischemic heart disease mortality was the leading cause of death among adult Black males (12.9%) and females (9.8%), as it is for adult White males (16.4%) and females (12.4%). Despite reduced risk of all-cause mortality among Black males and females, compared with White cohort members, there was notable increased risk for some cause-specific mortality. For instance, in the age-adjusted model, among the 25 causes of death examined, Black males had an increased risk of dying from four causes (HIV/AIDS, prostate cancer, diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular disease), compared with White males. Similarly, Black females were at an increased risk for 6 causes of death (HIV/AIDS, stomach cancer, corpus uteri cancer, lymphomas and multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus, and endocrine disorders) out of the 27 causes of death examined. These relative increased risks persisted for most causes of death after adjustment for differences in important social determinants of health.  Interpretation:   Results showed substantial variability in the risk of dying by cause of death between Black and White cohort members. An important step in reducing health inequities is the routine identification and surveillance of different health outcomes by population groups. This study helps fill that information gap.""","""['Michael Tjepkema', 'Tanya Christidis', 'Toyib Olaniyan', 'Jeremiah Hwee']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Health Rep""","""['Mortality-Air Pollution Associations in Low Exposure Environments (MAPLE): Phase 2.', 'Mortality from diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and cerebrovascular disease among blacks in a higher income area.', 'Mortality-Air Pollution Associations in Low-Exposure Environments (MAPLE): Phase 1.', 'Mortality and Morbidity Effects of Long-Term Exposure to Low-Level PM2.5, BC, NO2, and O3: An Analysis of European Cohorts in the ELAPSE Project.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

Subsequently, colony formation, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU), and transwell assays were performed to evaluate PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Western blot assay was applied for assessing the protein levels. Dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assays were implemented for verifying the association between miR-497-5p and circ_0085494 or NRBP1. The role of circ_0085494 in vivo was measured by establishing a mice xenograft model. Circ_0085494 was highly expressed in PCa tissues and cells, and its absence suppressed PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Circ_0085494 impacts NRBP1 content by adsorbing miR-497-5p. Meanwhile, the repression of circ_0085494 absence on tumor growth in vivo was validated.

We aimed to quantify seasonal trends in incidence and excess mortality for a wide range of malignancies, requiring more or less urgent clinical management.  Material and methods:   This nationwide cohort study included all Swedish residents aged 20-84 in 1990-2019. Incidence and relative survival in pancreatic, colorectal, lung, urothelial, breast, and prostate cancer, together with malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute leukemia diagnosed during holiday and post-holiday were compared to working (reference) season. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated using Poisson regression and excess (cancer) mortality rate ratios using flexible parametric models.  Results:   We identified 882,980 cancer cases. Incidence declined during holiday season for all malignancies and the IRR ranged from 0.58 (95% CI 0.57-0.59 in breast to 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94) in pancreatic cancer. A post-holiday increase was noted for acute leukemia, pancreatic, and lung cancer. For all malignancies except lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and acute leukemia, the excess mortality at 2 years from diagnosis was higher among those diagnosed during the holiday season. A tendency toward elevated short-term (0.5 years) excess mortality was noted in the post-holiday group, but long-term effects only persisted in breast cancer.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrates lower holiday detection rates and higher mortality rates in various cancer types diagnosed during holiday season.

We investigated the differential adoption of abiraterone and enzalutamide across facilities in a national healthcare system to understand the impact a facility has on the receipt of these novel therapies.  Methods:   Using data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse, we identified a cohort of men with CRPC who received the most common first-line therapies: abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel, or ketoconazole between 2010 and 2017. We described variability in the adoption of abiraterone and enzalutamide across facilities by time period (2010-2013 or 2014-2017). We categorized facilities depending on the timing of adoption of abiraterone and enzalutamide relative to other facilities and described facility characteristics associated with early and late adoption.  Results:   We identified 4998 men treated with ketoconazole, docetaxel, abiraterone, or enzalutamide as first-line CRPC therapy between 2010 and 2017 at 125 national facilities. When limiting the cohort to oral therapies, most patients treated earlier in the study period (2010-2013) received ketoconazole. A dramatic shift was seen by the second half of the study period (2014-2017) with most men treated with first-line abiraterone (61%). Despite this shift and a new standard of care, some facilities persisted in the widespread use of ketoconazole in the later period, so-called late adopting facilities. After multivariable adjustment, patients who received treatment at a late adopting facility were more likely receiving care at a lower complexity, rural facility, with less urology and hematology/oncology workforce (all p < 0.01).  Conclusion:   Many facilities persisted in their use of ketoconazole as first-line CRPC therapy, even when other facilities had adopted the new standard of care abiraterone and enzalutamide.

Materials and methods:   This retrospective study identified patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer in the Optum Research Database between 2014 and 2019. Adult men with ≥1 claim for metastatic disease within 90 days before or any time after the first prostate cancer claim who received androgen deprivation therapy were included. Physician specialty, determined from medical/pharmacy claims during each line of therapy, was categorized as urologist only, oncologist only, both (urologists and oncologists), or other (other specialties). Treatment intensification and patient characteristics were analyzed descriptively.  Results:   Of 4,675 patients, 16% were treated by urologists only, 20% by oncologists only, 63% by both, and 1.1% by others. The most frequent first line of therapy was androgen deprivation therapy ± first-generation nonsteroidal antiandrogens (>50%). Androgen deprivation therapy + docetaxel use declined over time, while androgen deprivation therapy + androgen receptor pathway inhibitor use increased. Patients seen by oncologists or both were younger, had fewer comorbidities, and were likelier to receive treatment intensification compared to those treated by urologists. By 2019, however, treatment intensification remained <40% from oncologists only or both, and <15% from urologists only. In the second and third lines of therapy, androgen deprivation therapy + androgen receptor pathway inhibitor was the most prescribed regimen across specialties (>50%).  Conclusions:   Treatment intensification was underused in first lines of therapy across urology and oncology specialties despite evidence of improved survival. In subsequent lines, androgen deprivation therapy + androgen receptor pathway inhibitor was prescribed more frequently across specialties. These results underscore the need for earlier treatment intensification by urologists and oncologists.""","""['Umang Swami', 'Agnes Hong', 'Nader N El-Chaar', 'Krishnan Ramaswamy', 'Brandon J Diessner', 'Cori J Blauer-Peterson', 'Rickard Sandin', 'David Nimke', 'Neeraj Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Editorial Comment.', 'Treatment Intensification Patterns and Utilization in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Sensitive Prostate Cancer.', 'Abiraterone plus prednisone added to androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel in de novo metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (PEACE-1): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 study with a 2\u2009×\u20092 factorial design.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The aims of this study were to establish age- and sex-specific RIs for the following nine common tumor markers and to validate the established RIs in Korean adults: alpha fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen (CA) 19-9, CA15-3, CA125, Human epididymis protein 4 (HE4), total prostate specific antigen, cytokeratin fragment (Cyfra) 21-1, and progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP).  Methods:   This cross-sectional study consecutively selected 214,159 individuals (aged 18-98 years) who underwent health checkups at 16 health-promotion centers in 13 Korean cities. Finally, 62,752 examinees were used to establish the RIs after removing outliers. RIs were established using an indirect method according to the CLSI EP28-A3C guideline. The established RIs were validated by calculating the proportion of individuals outside each RI.  Results:   Sex-related differences were observed for AFP, CEA, CA19-9, Cyfra 21-1, and ProGRP (p < 0.05): AFP, CEA and Cyfra 21-1 were higher in males, and CA19-9 and proGRP were higher in females.

Objective:   We used results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to study the genetic correlation between PD and different cancers to identify common genetic risk factors.  Methods:   We used individual data for participants of European ancestry from the Courage-PD (Comprehensive Unbiased Risk Factor Assessment for Genetics and Environment in Parkinson's Disease; PD, N = 16,519) and EPITHYR (differentiated thyroid cancer, N = 3527) consortia and summary statistics of GWASs from iPDGC (International Parkinson Disease Genomics Consortium; PD, N = 482,730), Melanoma Meta-Analysis Consortium (MMAC), Breast Cancer Association Consortium (breast cancer), the Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (prostate cancer), International Lung Cancer Consortium (lung cancer), and Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (ovarian cancer) (N comprised between 36,017 and 228,951 for cancer GWASs). We estimated the genetic correlation between PD and cancers using linkage disequilibrium score regression. We studied the association between PD and polymorphisms associated with cancers, and vice versa, using cross-phenotypes polygenic risk score (PRS) analyses.  Results:   We confirmed a previously reported positive genetic correlation of PD with melanoma (Gcorr = 0.16 [0.04; 0.28]) and reported an additional significant positive correlation of PD with prostate cancer (Gcorr = 0.11 [0.03; 0.19]). There was a significant inverse association between the PRS for ovarian cancer and PD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.89 [0.84; 0.94]). Conversely, the PRS of PD was positively associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.08 [1.06; 1.10]) and inversely associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 0.95 [0.91; 0.99]). The association between PD and ovarian cancer was mostly driven by rs183211 located in an intron of the NSF gene (17q21.31).  Conclusions:   We show evidence in favor of a contribution of pleiotropic genes to the association between PD and specific cancers. © 2023 The Authors.

In the present study, we investigated the role of paracrine interleukin-8 (IL-8) in the antagonistic expression of IL-8 and androgen receptor (AR), and the contribution of IL-8 to prostate cancer aggressiveness. In hormone-responsive LNCaP cells that do not express IL-8, recombinant IL-8 treatment significantly increased expressions of IL-8, CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9, Snail, and vimentin. IL-8 treatment significantly decreased AR and E-cadherin expression. IL-8-induced gene expression changes were suppressed by navarixin, a CXCR1/2 inhibitor, and gallein, a Gβγ inhibitor. In PC-3 androgen-refractory prostate cancer cells, IL-8 knockdown reduced expressions of CXCR2, MMP-2/9, Snail, and vimentin, and increased AR and E-cadherin expressions at the mRNA and protein levels. Co-culture with MEG-01 human megakaryocytic cells secreting high levels of IL-8 induced gene expression changes in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells, similar to those induced by IL-8 treatment. The altered gene expressions were accompanied by significant activation of transcription factor Snail in LNCaP and PC-3 cells. Treatment with the CXCR blocker navarixin inhibited the invasion of PC-3 cells but not LNCaP cells. However, invasion induced by MEG-01 was inhibited by navarixin in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells. The collective findings demonstrate that IL-8 enhances CXCR2 expression, which antagonistically regulates AR expression. More importantly, through changes in IL-8/CXCR2-regulated gene expression, IL-8 induces antiandrogen therapy resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.""","""['Sadan Dahal', 'Prakash Chaudhary', 'Yi-Sook Jung', 'Jung-Ae Kim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomol Ther (Seoul)""","""['In vitro modulation of tumor progression-associated properties of hormone refractory prostate carcinoma cell lines by cytokines.', 'Snail transcription factor regulates neuroendocrine differentiation in LNCaP prostate cancer cells.', 'Interleukin-6 regulates androgen receptor activity and prostate cancer cell growth.', 'Androgens induce a distinct response of epithelial-mesenchymal transition factors in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Interleukin-6 undergoes transition from growth inhibitor associated with neuroendocrine differentiation to stimulator accompanied by androgen receptor activation during LNCaP prostate cancer cell progression.']"""

The transducing surface was fabricated through two consecutive electrodeposition steps of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and chitosan (CS)-AgNPs-luminol electrochemiluminophore onto the glassy carbon electrode. In addition to an appropriate desirable biocompatibility, the electrochemical synthesis presents low-cost preparation and ultrafast determination opportunity. AgNPs play a linking role to attach luminol, as an ECL agent to the CS support via donor-acceptor bonds between Ag atoms with NH groups of luminol and CS. Also, AgNPs can amplify the ECL intensity as a consequence of their excellent specific surface area and conductivity. To enhance the performance of the nanobiosensor, AuNPs were also used due to their high-specific surface area and excellent affinity toward amine groups of CS. Based on this high-performance analysis strategy, ultrasensitive screening of PSA was attained with a desirable limit of detection of 0.6 ng mL-1 and a broad linear range between 1 pg mL-1 and 10 ng⋅mL-1 (R2=0.994).

This study used a novel in vitro approach, involving the exposure of PCa cells to sera, from obese or normal weight males, and to CaSR inhibitor NPS-2143. Cell viability was determined using MTT assay. MMP-9 activity and invasion were assessed using zymography and invasion chambers, respectively. Microscopy was used to visualize EMT proteins. qRT-PCR and immunoblot analysis were used to quantify changes in genes and proteins important for tumorigenesis. Exposure to obese sera increased the proliferation, and the invasive capacity of PCa cells and de-localized epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers, which were attenuated with CaSR inhibition. Exposure to obese sera upregulated mRNA expression of PTHrP and protein expression of COX-2, IL-6, and CaSR. Inhibition of CaSR downregulated the mRNA expression of PTHrP and RANK, and protein expression of pERK and TNF-α. Obesity was shown to increase invasion and upregulate the expression of genes and proteins involved in PCa tumorigenesis. CaSR inhibition downregulated the expression of several of these factors.

Epidemiological information indicated the relation of endocrine-disturbing chemicals with prostate cancer, testis tumor and diminished fertility. p53 is a key tumor silencer gene. The present study aimed to evaluate luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and the risk of p53 mutations as a result of exposure to polypropylene in non-tumorous adult male factory workers.  Methods:   In total, 150 (controls = 35, workers = 115) subjects were recruited. Groups were maintained according to the tenure of exposure G1 (1-5 years), G2 (6-10 years), G3 (11-15 years) and G4 (16-20 years). Concentrations of LH and FSH were determined through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Genotyping analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction based gel electrophoresis followed by DNA sequencing. The structural and functional impact of the mutation on the p53 structure was evaluated using 50-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and protein-DNA docking.  Results:   Mean plasma LH levels were significantly decreased in G1 (p > 0.05) as well as the G2, G3 and G4 (p > 0.001) groups. Similarly, FSH levels were significant decrease in G1 (p > 0.05), G2 (p > 0.01), G3 (p > 0.001) and G4 (p > 0.001) compared to the control group. Sequencing results found three variants i.e. g.13450 T>G, g.13430C>T and g.13737G>A. One of them was predicted to be disease-causing others are polymorphisms. MD simulation of missense mutation R273H showed no structural impact on the protein structure in MD simulation, but it resulted in weaker binding of p53 with the DNA that might lower the gene expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins.  Conclusions:   These findings predict decreased fertility and risk of malignancies in the future.

Given the rapidly evolving cancer care landscape, an updated understanding of the prevalence and costs of mental health conditions among patients with cancer is needed. This study assessed the incremental costs of anxiety and depression among Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.  Methods:   This retrospective cohort study used the SEER-Medicare database. Patients diagnosed with melanoma, breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal cancer between July 2013 and December 2017 were followed for at least 12 months and up to 36 months after cancer diagnosis. Patients were categorized on the basis of anxiety/depression (AD) diagnosis: (1) predating cancer, (2) onset after cancer, or (3) no AD. Multivariable regression was used to estimate differences in all-cause incremental costs (before v after cancer) between the three groups.  Results:   Of 230,626 patients, 10% had AD before their cancer diagnosis and 22% were diagnosed after cancer. In the first year after cancer diagnosis, average monthly health care costs were $5,750 in US dollars (USD) for patients with newly onset, $5,208 (USD) for patients with preexisting, and $3,919 (USD) for patients without a diagnosis of AD. The incremental cost of cancer was the greatest among patients with newly onset AD-$1,458 (USD) per month greater than those with no AD. Similar patterns were observed across cancer types and stages.  Conclusion:   One in three Medicare beneficiaries with cancer in this study had a diagnosis of anxiety or depression. Newly onset AD is associated with an increase in health care costs of $17,496 (USD) per year. Screening and management of mental health conditions for patients with cancer should be part of coordinated oncology care.""","""['Kelly Birch', 'Sukyung Chung', 'Sean R Zion', 'Joanna P MacEwan', 'Michael J Malecki']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCO Oncol Pract""","""['The Case for Accelerating Integrated Mental Health Care in the Cancer Setting.', 'Cost of cancer management by stage at diagnosis among Medicare beneficiaries.', 'Clinical and economic burden associated with stage III to IV triple-negative breast cancer: A SEER-Medicare historical cohort study in elderly women in the United States.', 'Increased healthcare costs by later stage cancer diagnosis.', 'Direct economic burden of high-risk and metastatic melanoma in the elderly: evidence from the SEER-Medicare linked database.', 'The burden of depression in prostate cancer.']"""

For example, AA metabolites regulate several critical biological functions associated with carcinogenesis: angiogenesis, apoptosis, and cancer invasion. However, little is known about the comparative changes in metabolite expression of the arachidonic acid pathway (AAP) in carcinogenesis. In this study, we examined transcriptome data from 12 cancers, such as breast invasive carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. We also report here a reverse-engineering strategy wherein we estimated metabolic signatures associated with AAP by (1) making deductive inferences through transcriptome-level data extraction, (2) remodeling AA metabolism, and (3) performing a comparative analysis of cancer types to determine the similarities and differences between different cancer types with respect to AA metabolic alterations. We identified 77 AAP gene signatures differentially expressed in cancers and 37 AAP metabolites associated with them. Importantly, the metabolite 15(S)-HETE was identified in almost all cancers, while arachidonate, 5-HETE, PGF2α, 14,15-EET, 8,9-EET, 5,6-EET, and 20-HETE were discovered as other most regulated metabolites. This study shows that the 12 cancers studied herein, although in different branches of the AAP, have altered expression of AAP gene signatures.

However, the molecular mechanism that triggers NED is unknown. Trigred motif 36 (TRIM36), a member of the TRIM protein family, exhibits oncogenic or anti-oncogenic roles in various cancers. We have previously reported that TRIM36 is highly expressed to inhibit the invasion and proliferation of PCa. In the present study, we first found that TRIM36 was lowly expressed in NEPC and its overexpression suppressed the NED of PCa. Next, based on proteomic analysis, we found that TRIM36 inhibited the glycolysis pathway through suppressing hexokinase 2 (HK2), a crucial glycolytic enzyme catalyzing the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate. TRIM36 specifically bound to HK2 through lysine 48 (lys48)-mediated ubiquitination of HK2. Moreover, TRIM36-mediated ubiquitination degradation of HK2 downregulated the level of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4), a process that contributed to ferroptosis. In conclusion, TRIM36 can inhibit glycolysis via lys48-mediated HK2 ubiquitination to reduce GPX4 expression and activate ferroptosis, thereby inhibiting the NED in PCa.

Arming activated T cells (ATC) with anti-CD3 x anti-tumour associated antigen (TAA) BiAbs converts ATC into non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted anti-tumour cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Binding of target antigens via the BiAb bridge enables specific anti-tumour cytotoxicity, Th1 cytokines release, and T cell proliferation. Clinical trials in breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancer using BATs armed with chemically heteroconjugated BiAbs demonstrated safety, feasibility, induction of anti-tumour immune responses and potential increases in overall survival (OS).Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to develop a recombinant BiAb that confers enhanced anti-tumour activity of BATs against a broad range of solid tumours.Methods: A recombinant anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) x anti-CD3 (OKT3) BiAb (rEGFRBi) was designed and expressed in CHO cells, used to arm ATC (rEGFR-BATs), and tested for specific cytotoxicity against breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers and glioblastoma.Results: rEGFR-BATs exhibit remarkably enhanced specific cytotoxicity and T1 cytokine secretion against a wide range of solid tumour cell lines vs. their respective chemically-heteroconjugated BATs.Conclusion: rEGFR-BATs may provide a ""universal"" T cell therapy for treating a wide range of solid tumours.

A marker/receptor called Dipeptidyl peptidase 4/CD26(DPP4/CD26) may be crucial in determining susceptibility to tumors and coronaviruses. However, the regulation of DPP4 in COVID‑invaded cancer patients and its role on small molecule compounds remain unclear. The present study used the Human Protein Atlas, Monaco, and Schmiedel databases to analyze the expression of DPP4 in human tissues and immune cells. The association between DPP4 expression and survival in various tumor tissues was compared using GEPIA 2. The DNMIVD database was used to analyze the correlation between DPP4 expression and promoter methylation in various tumors. On the cBioPortal network, the frequency of DPP4 DNA mutations in various cancers was analyzed. The correlation between DPP4 expression and immunomodulators was analyzed by TISIDB database. The inhibitory effects of cordycepin (CD), N6, N6‑dimethyladenosine (m62A) and adenosine (AD) on DPP4 in cancer cells were evaluated. DPP4 was mainly expressed in endocrine tissue, followed by gastrointestinal tract, female tissue (mainly in placenta), male tissue (mainly in prostate and seminal vesicle), proximal digestive tract, kidney, bladder, liver, gallbladder and respiratory system. In immune cells, DPP4 mRNA was mainly expressed in T cells, and its expression was upregulated in esophageal carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), lung adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, thyroid carcinoma and thymoma. However, it was downregulated in breast invasive carcinoma, kidney chromophobe, lung squamous cell carcinoma and skin cutaneous melanoma. Thus, DPP4 is involved in viral invasion in most types of cancer. The expression of DPP4 could be inhibited by CD, m62A and AD in different tumor cells. Moreover, CD significantly inhibited the formation of GFP‑positive syncytial cells. In vivo experiments with AD injection further showed that AD significantly inhibited lymphocyte activating factor 3 expression. These drugs may have potential to treat COVID‑19 by targeting DPP4. Thus, DPP4 may be medically significant for SARS‑CoV‑2‑infected cancer patients, providing prospective novel targets and concepts for the creation of drugs against COVID‑19.""","""['Jiaman Du#', 'Jiewen Fu#', 'Wenqian Zhang', 'Lianmei Zhang', 'Hanchun Chen', 'Jingliang Cheng', 'Tao He', 'Junjiang Fu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['Distinct Roles of Adenosine Deaminase Isoenzymes ADA1 and ADA2: A Pan-Cancer Analysis.', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 Inhibitors Reduce Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Activating Lymphocyte Chemotaxis in Mice.', 'Impact of BSG/CD147 gene expression on diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies towards malignant cancers and possible susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.', 'Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibition in COVID-19.', 'The lethal internal face of the coronaviruses: Kidney tropism of the SARS, MERS, and COVID19 viruses.', 'CTSL, a prognostic marker of breast cancer, that promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in cells in triple-negative breast cancer.', 'New progresses on cell surface protein HSPA5/BiP/GRP78 in cancers and COVID-19.', 'Comprehensive analysis, immune, and cordycepin regulation for SOX9 expression in pan-cancers and the matched healthy tissues.']"""

CT‑inducible genes in human prostate were identified by subtraction hybridization. Among these genes, zinc finger protein like 1 (ZFPL1) protein was interesting since it was abundantly expressed in malignant prostates but was almost absent in benign prostates. ZFPL1 expression was upregulated by CT and androgens, and ZFPL1 protein was secreted by prostate tumor cells through exosomal secretion. Serum levels of ZFPL1 in cancer patients were at least 4‑fold higher than those in the sera of cancer‑free individuals. Cell biology of ZFPL1 suggests its localization in Golgi bodies and exosomes, and its colocalization with chromogranin A and CD44. These results suggested that ZFPL1 is secreted by tumor cells of neuroendocrine (NE)/stem cell phenotype. The knockdown of endogenous ZFPL1 in (PC) cells led to a remarkable decrease in cell proliferation, and invasion while increasing their apoptosis. As expected, the overexpression of ZFPL1 in prostate cells had an opposite effect on these functions. The knockdown of ZFPL1 in PC cells also decreased Akt phosphorylation, suggesting the actions of ZFPL1 may be mediated through the PI3K‑Akt pathway. Moreover, the present results revealed that ZFPL1 is released by tumors cells of NE or androgen‑independent phenotype and its serum levels are significantly higher in cancer patients, suggesting that it may serve as a blood‑based non‑invasive biomarker of aggressive PC.""","""['Neshat Masud', 'Afaf Aldahish', 'Kenneth A Iczkowski', 'Ajay Kale', 'Girish V Shah']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Oncol""","""['RING domain of zinc finger protein like 1 is essential for cell proliferation in endometrial cancer cell line RL95-2.', 'ZFPL1, a novel ring finger protein required for cis-Golgi integrity and efficient ER-to-Golgi transport.', 'Knockdown of ZFPL1 results in increased autophagy and autophagy‑related cell death in NCI‑N87 and BGC‑823 human gastric carcinoma cell lines.', 'Granin-A, parathyroid hormone-related protein, and calcitonin gene products in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation and clinical value of neuroendocrine differentiation in human prostatic tumors.']"""

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of different RT strategies on peripheral B, T, and Natural killer (NK) lymphocytes at precise longitudinal time-points in PCa. 18 patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (40 Gy/3FRX), definitive moderate-hypofractionation (62 Gy/20FRX), or post-operative conventional-fractionation RT (66-69 Gy/30FRX) were prospectively evaluated for the immune cell profile in terms of immune cell composition, differentiation stage, cytokine production and inhibitory receptor (IR) expression. The immune-monitoring of the 18 patients revealed that RT affects the balance of systemic immune cells, with the main differences observed between SBRT and conventionally fractionated RT. SBRT favorably impacts immune response in term of increased B cells, central-memory and effector-memory CD8+ T cells, along with decreased Treg cells after treatment. On the contrary, conventional fractionated RT had a long-term negative effect on the systemic immune profile, including a decrease of total lymphocyte counts accompanied by an increase of neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio. Total B and T cells decreased and Treg-to-CD8+ ratio increased. Functionality of T lymphocytes were not affected by any of the 3-fractionation schedules. Interestingly, SBRT significantly up-regulates the expression of V-domain immunoglobulin suppressor of T-cell activation (VISTA) in CD8+ T cells in the absence of other IRs.

The complexity of decision science models may prevent their use to assist in decision making. User-centered design (UCD) principles provide an opportunity to engage end users in model development and refinement, potentially reducing complexity and increasing model utilization in a practical setting. We report our experiences with UCD to develop a modeling tool for cancer control planners evaluating cancer survivorship interventions. Design. Using UCD principles (described in the article), we developed a dynamic cohort model of cancer survivorship for individuals with female breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer over 10 y. Parameters were obtained from the National Program of Cancer Registries and peer-reviewed literature, with model outcomes captured in quality-adjusted life-years and net monetary benefit. Prototyping and iteration were conducted with structured focus groups involving state cancer control planners and staff from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Public Health Association. Results. Initial feedback highlighted model complexity and unclear purpose as barriers to end user uptake. Revisions addressed complexity by simplifying model input requirements, providing clear examples of input types, and reducing complex language. Wording was added to the results page to explain the interpretation of results. After these updates, feedback demonstrated that end users more clearly understood how to use and apply the model for cancer survivorship resource allocation tasks. Conclusions. A UCD approach identified challenges faced by end users in integrating a decision aid into their workflow. This approach created collaboration between modelers and end users, tailoring revisions to meet the needs of the users. Future models developed for individuals without a decision science background could leverage UCD to ensure the model meets the needs of the intended audience.

Thus, the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) Advisory Committee for Radiation Oncology Practice (ACROP) guidelines seeks to present current recommendations for the clinical use of ADT in the various indications of EBRT.  Material and methods:   A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE PubMed that evaluated EBRT and ADT in prostate cancer. The search focused on randomized, Phase II and III trials published in English from January 2000 to May 2022. In case topics were addressed in the absence of Phase II or III trials, recommendations were labelled accordingly based on the limited body of evidence. Localized PCa was classified according to D'Amico et al. classification in low-, intermediate and high risk PCa. The ACROP clinical committee identified 13 European experts who discussed and analyzed the body of evidence concerning the use of ADT with EBRT for prostate cancer.  Results:   Key issues were identified and are discussed: It was concluded that no additional ADT is recommended for low-risk prostate cancer patients, whereas for intermediate- and high-risk patients four to six months and two to three years of ADT are recommended. Likewise, patients with locally advanced prostate cancer are recommended to receive ADT for two to three years and when ≥ 2 high-risk factors (cT3-4, ISUP grade ≥ 4 or PSA ≥ 40 ng/ml) or cN1 is present ADT for three years plus additional Abiraterone for two years is recommended. For postoperative patients no ADT is recommended for adjuvant EBRT in pN0 patients whereas for pN1 patients adjuvant EBRT with long-term ADT is performed for at least 24 to 36 months. In the setting of salvage EBRT ADT is performed in biochemically persistent PCa patients with no evidence of metastatic disease. Long-term ADT (24 months) is recommended in pN0 patients with high risk of further progression (PSA ≥ 0.7 ng/ml and ISUP grade group ≥ 4) and a life expectancy of over ten years, whereas short-term ADT (6 months) is recommended in pN0 patients with lower risk profile (PSA < 0.7 ng/ml and ISUP grade group 4). Patients considered for ultra-hypofractionated EBRT as well as patients with image based local recurrence within the prostatic fossa or lymph node recurrence should participate in appropriate clinical trials evaluating the role of additional ADT.  Conclusion:   These ESTRO-ACROP recommendations are evidence-based and relevant to the use of ADT in combination with EBRT in PCa for the most common clinical settings.""","""['Nina-Sophie Schmidt-Hegemann', 'Constantinos Zamboglou', 'Malcolm Mason', 'Nicolas Mottet', 'Karel Hinnen', 'Gert De Meerleer', 'Cesare Cozzarini', 'Philippe Maingon', 'Ann Henry', 'Martin Spahn', 'Philip Cornford', 'Claus Belka', 'Thomas Wiegel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Benefits and Risks of Primary Treatments for High-risk Localized and Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer: An International Multidisciplinary Systematic Review.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

First, FL-V2CTx was prepared by the delamination of multi-layer V2CTx (ML-V2CTx) with tetramethylammonium hydroxide. The aptamer-carboxyl graphene quantum dots (CGQDs) probe was prepared by combining the aminated PSA aptamer and CGQDs. Then, the aptamer-CGQDs were absorbed onto the surface of FL-V2CTx by hydrogen bond interaction, which led to the decrease in fluorescence of aptamer-CGQDs due to photoinduced energy transfer. After addition of PSA, PSA-aptamer-CGQDs complex was released from FL-V2CTx. The fluorescence intensity of aptamer-CGQDs-FL-V2CTx with PSA was higher than that without PSA. The FL-V2CTx-based fluorescence aptasensor provided a PSA detection linear range from 0.1 to 20 ng mL-1 with detection limit of 0.03 ng mL-1. The ΔF value of fluorescence intensities for aptamer-CGQDs-FL-V2CTx with and without PSA was 5.6, 3.7, 7.7, and 5.4 times of ML-V2CTx, few-layer titanium carbide (FL-Ti3C2Tx), ML-Ti3C2Tx and graphene oxide aptasensors, respectively, indicating the advantage of FL-V2CTx. The aptasensor had high selectivity for PSA detection compared with some proteins and tumor markers. This proposed method had convenience and high sensitivity for PSA determination. The determination results of PSA in human serum samples using the aptasensor were consistent with those by chemiluminescent immunoanalysis. The fluorescence aptasensor can be successfully applied for PSA determination in serum samples of prostate cancer patients.""","""['Tianyi Zhu', 'Qiukai Tang', 'Yanbo Zeng', 'Shijie Chen', 'Yiwen Yang', 'Hailong Wang', 'Jianrong Chen', 'Longhua Guo', 'Lei Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Spectrochim Acta A Mol Biomol Spectrosc""","""['A novel fluorescence aptasensor based on PCN-223 as an efficient quencher for sensitive determination of prostate-specific antigen.', 'An electrochemical aptasensor for detection of prostate-specific antigen using reduced graphene gold nanocomposite and Cu/carbon quantum dots.', 'Highly-sensitive aptasensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer between l-cysteine capped ZnS quantum dots and graphene oxide sheets for the determination of edifenphos fungicide.', 'The electrochemical detection of prostate specific antigen on glassy carbon electrode modified with combinations of graphene quantum dots, cobalt phthalocyanine and an aptamer.', 'Nanomaterial based aptasensing of prostate specific antigen (PSA): Recent progress and challenges in efficient diagnosis of prostate cancer using biomedicine.']"""

Methods:   A prospective observational study, with a final cohort of 200 patients undergoing mpMRI scans, was performed at our institution. An expert fellowship-trained urogenital radiologist interpreted all 200 scans based on PI-RADS v2.1. The scans were divided into four equal batches of 50 patients. Four independent readers evaluated each batch with and without the use of AI-assisted software, blinded to expert and individual reports. Dedicated training sessions were held before and after each batch. Image quality rated according to PI-QUAL and reporting times were recorded. Readers' confidence was also evaluated. A final evaluation of the first batch was conducted at the end of the study to assess for any changes in performance.  Results:   The overall kappa coefficient differences in PI-RADS scoring agreement without and with Quantib® were 0.673 to 0.736 for Reader 1, 0.628 to 0.483 for Reader 2, 0.603 to 0.292 for Reader 3 and 0.586 to 0.613 for Reader 4.

Although aggressive end-of-life (EOL) care is common among community-dwelling patients with cancer, little is known about such patterns of care among NH residents with cancer.  Objective:   To compare markers of aggressive EOL care between older adults with metastatic cancer who are NH residents and their community-dwelling counterparts.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database linked with the Medicare database and the Minimum Data Set (including NH clinical assessment data) for deaths occurring from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017, among 146 329 older patients with metastatic breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, or prostate cancer, with a lookback period in claims data through July 1, 2012. Statistical analysis was conducted between March 2021 and September 2022.  Exposures:   Nursing home status.  Main outcomes and measures:   Markers of aggressive EOL care were cancer-directed treatment, intensive care unit admission, more than 1 emergency department visit or more than 1 hospitalization in the last 30 days of life, hospice enrollment in the last 3 days of life, and in-hospital death.  Results:   The study population included 146 329 patients 66 years of age or older (mean [SD] age, 78.2 [7.3] years; 51.9% men). Aggressive EOL care was more common among NH residents than community-dwelling residents (63.6% vs 58.3%). Nursing home status was associated with 4% higher odds of receiving aggressive EOL care (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04 [95% CI, 1.02-1.07]), 6% higher odds of more than 1 hospital admission in the last 30 days of life (aOR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.10]), and 61% higher odds of dying in the hospital (aOR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.57-1.65]). Conversely, NH status was associated with lower odds of receiving cancer-directed treatment (aOR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.55-0.58]), intensive care unit admission (aOR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.79-0.84]), or enrollment in hospice in the last 3 days of life (aOR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.86-0.92]).  Conclusions and relevance:   Despite increased emphasis to reduce aggressive EOL care in the past several decades, such care remains common among older persons with metastatic cancer and is slightly more prevalent among NH residents than their community-dwelling counterparts.

In the group with PSA < 10 ng/mL, the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of [68Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT were lower than [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT (60.00% vs. 80.30%, p = 0.12, 23.26% vs. 88.37%, p = 0.000, and 0.524 vs. 0.822, p = 0.000, respectively). [68Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT exhibited significantly higher SUVmax in specimens with GS = 6 (p = 0.04) and in the low-risk group (p = 0.01), and its uptake did not increase with PSA level, GS, or clinical stage.  Conclusion:   This prospective study provided evidence for the superior accuracy of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT over [68Ga]Ga-RM26 PET/CT in detecting more clinically significant PCa.

Here, we have evaluated a role for human single-strand binding protein 1 (hSSB1/NABP2) in modulation of the cellular response to androgens and ionizing radiation (IR). hSSB1 has defined roles in transcription and maintenance of genome stability, yet little is known about this protein in PCa.  Methods:   We correlated hSSB1 with measures of genomic instability across available PCa cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Microarray and subsequent pathway and transcription factor enrichment analysis were performed on LNCaP and DU145 prostate cancer cells.  Results:   Our data demonstrate that hSSB1 expression in PCa correlates with measures of genomic instability including multigene signatures and genomic scars that are reflective of defects in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks via homologous recombination. In response to IR-induced DNA damage, we demonstrate that hSSB1 regulates cellular pathways that control cell cycle progression and the associated checkpoints. In keeping with a role for hSSB1 in transcription, our analysis revealed that hSSB1 negatively modulates p53 and RNA polymerase II transcription in PCa. Of relevance to PCa pathology, our findings highlight a transcriptional role for hSSB1 in regulating the androgen response. We identified that AR function is predicted to be impacted by hSSB1 depletion, whereby this protein is required to modulate AR gene activity in PCa.  Conclusions:   Our findings point to a key role for hSSB1 in mediating the cellular response to androgen and DNA damage via modulation of transcription. Exploiting hSSB1 in PCa might yield benefits as a strategy to ensure a durable response to ADT and/or radiotherapy and improved patient outcomes.""","""['Mark N Adams', 'Laura V Croft', 'Aaron Urquhart', 'Mohamed Ashick Mohamed Saleem', 'Anja Rockstroh', 'Pascal H G Duijf', 'Patrick B Thomas', 'Genevieve P Ferguson', 'Idris Mohd Najib', 'Esha T Shah', 'Emma Bolderson', 'Shivashankar Nagaraj', 'Elizabeth D Williams', 'Colleen C Nelson', ""Kenneth J O'Byrne"", 'Derek J Richard']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['hSSB1 (NABP2/OBFC2B) is regulated by oxidative stress.', 'Human single-stranded DNA binding protein 1 (hSSB1/NABP2) is required for the stability and repair of stalled replication forks.', 'hSSB1 (NABP2/ OBFC2B) is required for the repair of 8-oxo-guanine by the hOGG1-mediated base excision repair pathway.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.', 'Human single-stranded DNA binding protein 1 (hSSB1, OBFC2B), a critical component of the DNA damage response.']"""

Therefore, the analysis and identification of disease-related m7G modification regulators will accelerate advances in understanding disease pathogenesis. However, the implications of alterations in the regulators of m7G modifications remain poorly understood in prostate adenocarcinoma. In the present study, we analyze the expression patterns of 29 m7G RNA modification regulators in prostate adenocarcinoma using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and perform consistent clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We find that 18 m7G-related genes are differentially expressed in tumor and normal tissues. In different cluster subgroups, DEGs are mainly enriched in tumorigenesis and tumor development. Furthermore, immune analyses demonstrate that patients in cluster 1 have significantly higher scores for stromal and immune cells, such as B cells, T cells, and macrophages. Then, a TCGA-related risk model is developed and successfully validated using a Gene Expression Omnibus external dataset. Two genes ( EIF4A1 and NCBP2) are determined to be prognostically significant. Most importantly, we construct tissue microarrays from 26 tumor specimens and 20 normal specimens, and further confirm that EIF4A1 and NCBP2 are associated with tumor progression and Gleason score. Therefore, we conclude that the m7G RNA methylation regulators may be involved in the poor prognosis of patients with prostate adenocarcinoma.

The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of treatment decision-making (DM) preferences, general self-efficacy (SE) and fear of progression (FoP) among couples coping with advanced PCa.  Methods:   In this explorative study, 96 patients with advanced PCa and their spouses answered the multiple choice version of the Control Preferences Scale (CPS, regarding DM), General Self-Efficacy Short Scale (ASKU, regarding SE), and short form of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire (FoP-Q-SF, regarding FoP). Corresponding questionnaires were employed for patients' spouses were evaluated, and correlations were subsequently drawn.  Results:   More than half of the patients (61%) and spouses (62%) preferred active DM. Collaborative DM was preferred by 25% of patients and 32% of spouses, and 14% of patients and 5% of spouses preferred passive DM. FoP was significantly higher among spouses than among patients (p < 0.001). The difference in SE was not significant between patients and spouses (p = 0.064).

Enriched in the bone, TGF-β plays a pivotal role in bone metastasis development. However, directly targeting TGF-β or its receptors has been challenging for the treatment of bone metastasis. We previously found that TGF-β induces and then depends on the acetylation of transcription factor KLF5 at K369 to regulate multiple biological processes, including the induction of EMT, cellular invasiveness, and bone metastasis. Acetylated KLF5 (Ac-KLF5) and its downstream effectors are thus potential therapeutic targets for treating TGF-β-induced bone metastasis in prostate cancer.  Methods:   A spheroid invasion assay was applied to prostate cancer cells expressing KLF5K369Q, which mimics Ac-KLF5, to screen 1987 FDA-approved drugs for invasion suppression. Luciferase- and KLF5K369Q-expressing cells were injected into nude mice via the tail artery to model bone metastasis. Bioluminescence imaging, micro-CT), and histological analyses were applied to monitor and evaluate bone metastases. RNA-sequencing, bioinformatic, and biochemical analyses were used to understand nitazoxanide (NTZ)-regulated genes, signaling pathways, and the underlying mechanisms. The binding of NTZ to KLF5 proteins was evaluated using fluorescence titration, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and circular dichroism (CD) analysis.  Results:   NTZ, an anthelmintic agent, was identified as a potent invasion inhibitor in the screening and validation assays. In KLF5K369Q-induced bone metastasis, NTZ exerted a potent inhibitory effect in preventive and therapeutic modes. NTZ also inhibited osteoclast differentiation, a cellular process responsible for bone metastasis induced by KLF5K369Q. NTZ attenuated the function of KLF5K369Q in 127 genes' upregulation and 114 genes' downregulation. Some genes' expression changes were significantly associated with worse overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. One such change was the upregulation of MYBL2, which functionally promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer. Additional analyses demonstrated that NTZ bound to the KLF5 protein, KLF5K369Q bound to the promoter of MYBL2 to activate its transcription, and NTZ attenuated the binding of KLF5K369Q to the MYBL2 promoter.  Conclusions:   NTZ is a potential therapeutic agent for bone metastasis induced by the TGF-β/Ac-KLF5 signaling axis in prostate cancer and likely other cancers.""","""['Qingqing Huang#', 'Mingcheng Liu#', 'Duo Zhang', 'Bing-Biao Lin', 'Xing Fu', 'Zhiqian Zhang', 'Baotong Zhang', 'Jin-Tang Dong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""['TGF-β causes Docetaxel resistance in Prostate Cancer via the induction of Bcl-2 by acetylated KLF5 and Protein Stabilization.', 'Acetylation of KLF5 maintains EMT and tumorigenicity to cause chemoresistant bone metastasis in prostate cancer.', 'Different expression patterns and functions of acetylated and unacetylated Klf5 in the proliferation and differentiation of prostatic epithelial cells.', 'Ras inhibits TGF-β-induced KLF5 acetylation and transcriptional complex assembly via regulating SMAD2/3 phosphorylation in epithelial cells.', 'A New Hypothetical Concept in Metabolic Understanding of Cardiac Fibrosis: Glycolysis Combined with TGF-β and KLF5 Signaling.', 'TSPAN18 facilitates bone metastasis of prostate cancer by protecting STIM1 from TRIM32-mediated ubiquitination.']"""

Biosensors have proven their effectiveness in monitoring cancer biomarkers but are still limited to a series of requirements. This work proposes an integrated power solution, with an autonomous and self-signaling biosensing device. The biorecognition element is produced in situ by molecular imprinting to detect sarcosine, a known biomarker for prostate cancer. The biosensor was assembled on the counter-electrode of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), simultaneously using EDOT and Pyrrole as monomers for the biomimetic process and the catalytic reduction of triiodide in the DSSC. After the rebinding assays, the hybrid DSSC/biosensor displayed a linear behavior when plotting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the charge transfer resistance (RCT) against the logarithm of the concentration of sarcosine. The latter obtained a sensitivity of 0.468 Ω/decade of sarcosine concentration, with a linear range between 1 ng/mL and 10 μg/mL, and a limit of detection of 0.32 ng/mL. When interfacing an electrochromic cell, consisting of a PEDOT-based material, with the hybrid device, a color gradient between 1 ng/mL and 10 μg/mL of sarcosine was observed. Thus, the device can be used anywhere with access to a light source, completely equipment-free, suitable for point-of-care analysis and capable of detecting sarcosine within a range of clinical interest.""","""['Carolina S Hora', 'Ana P M Tavares', 'Liliana P T Carneiro', 'Dzmitry Ivanou', 'Adélio M Mendes', 'M Goreti F Sales']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Talanta""","""['Self-powered and self-signalled autonomous electrochemical biosensor applied to cancinoembryonic antigen determination.', 'Photovoltaics, plasmonics, plastic antibodies and electrochromism combined for a novel generation of self-powered and self-signalled electrochemical biomimetic sensors.', 'A dye-sensitized solar cell acting as the electrical reading box of an immunosensor: Application to CEA determination.', 'Quantitative analysis of sarcosine with special emphasis on biosensors: a review.', 'Review on fabrication methodologies and its impacts on performance of dye-sensitized solar cells.']"""

We used long-term cell cultures to model CRPC; a testosterone-dependent cell line (VCaP-T) and cell line adapted to grow in low testosterone (VCaP-CT). These were used to uncover persistent and adaptive responses to testosterone level. RNA was sequenced to study AR-regulated genes. Expression level changed due to testosterone depletion in 418 genes in VCaP-T (AR-associated genes). To evaluate significance for CRPC growth, we compared which of them were adaptive i.e., restored expression level in VCaP-CT. Adaptive genes were enriched to steroid metabolism, immune response and lipid metabolism. The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma data were used to assess the association with cancer aggressiveness and progression-free survival. Expressions of 47 AR-associated or association gaining genes were statistically significant markers for progression-free survival.

In phase 2, pathologists reported atypical small acinar proliferation (ASAP) less often (about 30% less). Additionally, they requested significantly fewer immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies (about 20% less) and second opinions (about 40% less). The median time required for reading and reporting each slide was about 20% lower in phase 2, in both negative and cancer cases. Lastly, the average total agreement with the software performance was observed in about 70% of the cases, being significantly higher in negative cases (about 90%) than in cancer cases (about 30%).

Single models, as well as different combinations of them, were generated to calculate their performances. A cross-validation approach was used to evaluate the internal validity of the models.  Results:   All radiomic models outperformed the clinical models. The best model for grade group prediction was the combination of PET + ADC + T2w radiomic features, showing sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 0.85, 0.83, 0.84, and 0.85, respectively. The MRI-derived (ADC + T2w) features showed sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 0.88, 0.78, 0.83, and 0.84, respectively. PET-derived features showed 0.83, 0.68, 0.76, and 0.79, respectively. The baseline clinical model showed 0.73, 0.44, 0.60, and 0.58, respectively. The addition of the clinical model to the best radiomic model did not improve the diagnostic performance. The performances of MRI and PET/MRI radiomic models as per the cross-validation scheme yielded an accuracy of 0.80 (AUC = 0.79), whereas clinical models presented an accuracy of 0.60 (AUC = 0.60).  Conclusion:   The combined [18F]-DCFPyL PET/MRI radiomic model was the best-performing model and outperformed the clinical model for pathological grade group prediction, indicating a complementary value of the hybrid PET/MRI model for non-invasive risk stratification of PCa. Further prospective studies are required to confirm the reproducibility and clinical utility of this approach.""","""['Adriano Basso Dias#', 'Seyed Ali Mirshahvalad#', 'Claudia Ortega', 'Nathan Perlis', 'Alejandro Berlin', 'Theodorus van der Kwast', 'Sangeet Ghai', 'Kartik Jhaveri', 'Ur Metser', 'Masoom Haider', 'Lisa Avery', 'Patrick Veit-Haibach']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['The added value of PSMA PET/MR radiomics for prostate cancer staging.', 'The added value of PSMA PET/MR radiomics for prostate cancer staging.', 'Role of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET radiomics to predict post-surgical ISUP grade in primary prostate cancer.', 'Prospective analysis of clinically significant prostate cancer detection with 18FDCFPyL PET/MRI compared to multiparametric MRI: a comparison with the histopathology in the radical prostatectomy specimen, the ProStaPET study.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Additional Value of PET Radiomic Features for the Initial Staging of Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review from the Literature.']"""

Methods:   A retrospective analysis of men who underwent a 12-core systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (SB) and a low-field MRI guided transperineal targeted biopsy (MRI-TB). Comparison of the detection of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) (Gleason Grade [GG] ≥ 2) by SB and low field MRI-TB, stratified by Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System (PI-RADS) score, prostate volume, and prostate serum antigen (PSA) was performed.  Results:   A total of 39 men underwent both the MRI-TB and SB biopsy. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 69.0 (61.5-73) years, body mass index (BMI) was 28.9 kg/m2 (25.3-34.3), prostate volume was 46.5 cc (32-72.7), and PSA was 9.5 ng/ml (5.5-13.2). The majority (64.4%) of patients had PI-RADS ≥ 4 lesions and 25% of lesions were anterior on pre-biopsy MRII. Cancer detection rate (CDR) was greatest when combining SB and MRI-TB (64.1%). MRI-TB detected 74.3% (29/39) cancers. Of which, 53.8% (21/39) were csPCa while SB detected 42.5% (17/39) csPCa (p = 0.21). In 32.5% (13/39) of cases, MRI-TB upstaged the final diagnosis, compared to 15% (6/39) of cases in which SB upstaged the final diagnosis (p = 0.11).  Conclusion:   Low-field MRI-TB is clinically feasible. Although future studies on the accuracy of MRI-TB system are needed, the initial CDR is comparable to those seen with fusion-based prostate biopsies.

Whether FRAX accurately predicts fractures in men with prostate cancer is unknown. Our objective was to assess the performance of FRAX for predicting incident fractures in men with prostate cancer. Men from the Manitoba Bone Mineral Density (BMD) Registry (1996-2018) with prostate cancer diagnoses in the 3 years prior to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were identified. FRAX scores with and without BMD were calculated. From population-based healthcare data we identified incident MOF, hip fracture, any osteoporotic fracture and death from the date of BMD testing to March 31, 2018. Cox regression was performed to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) per standard deviation increase in FRAX score. Observed 10-year probability (estimated with competing risk of mortality) was compared with 10-year FRAX-predicted fracture probability to assess calibration. The study population included 684 men with prostate cancer (mean age 74.6 years) and 8608 men without prostate cancer (mean age 65.5 years). FRAX stratified risk for MOF (HR 1.91, 95% CI 1.48-2.45 with BMD; HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.43-2.69 without BMD) and hip fracture (HR 3.37, 95% CI 1.90-6.01 with BMD; HR 4.58, 95% CI 2.17-9.67 without BMD) in men with prostate cancer. There was no effect modification observed with prostate cancer status or current androgen deprivation therapy. Observed 10-year fracture probability in men with prostate cancer showed good agreement with FRAX with and without BMD included in the calculation (observed/predicted calibration ratios MOF 0.97, hip 1.00 with BMD; MOF 0.92, hip 0.93 with BMD). In conclusion, FRAX reliably predicts incident fractures in men with prostate cancer. © 2023 The Authors.

Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC) have been identified in PCa, although contradictory effects in malignant transformation and tumor progression have been described. Since umbilical cord (UC) MSC and cord blood serum (CBS) are rich in numerous growth and anti-inflammatory factors, UC-MSC secretome and CBS are able to modulate tumor cell proliferation and survival as well as immunity and angiogenesis. In the present study, we address this relationship and investigate the influence of UC-MSC secretome and CBS on two human PCa cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) and a normal epithelial prostate cell line (HPEpiC). Our results disclosed that upon exposure to UC-MSC-conditioned medium or CBS, both PC3 and LNCaP cells exhibited reduced viability, proliferation, and motility while non-malignant epithelial prostate cells were unaffected. These findings were corroborated by expression analysis of AKT/PI3K signaling pathway, p53 and interleukin genes. UC-MSC and CBS factors decreased the expression of growth-stimulating AKT and PI3K effectors and simultaneously up-regulated the expression of tumor-suppressor p53. Moreover, a more anti-inflammatory expression profile was found in both malignant PCa cell lines. Altogether, these results shed light into possible mechanisms by which UC-MSC and CBS reduce PCa progression, further reinforcing their potential use as novel therapeutic agents in PCa.""","""['André Sousa', 'Pedro Coelho', 'Fernanda Leite', 'Catarina Teixeira', 'Ana Catarina Rocha', 'Inês Santos', 'Pilar Baylina', 'Ruben Fernandes', 'Raquel Soares', 'Raquel Costa#', 'Andreia Gomes#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Hum Cell""","""['The Secretome Derived From 3D-Cultured Umbilical Cord Tissue MSCs Counteracts Manifestations Typifying Rheumatoid Arthritis.', 'Integrated Analysis of Transcriptome and Secretome From Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Reveal New Mechanisms for the Modulation of Inflammation and Immune Activation.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell secretome and regenerative therapy after cancer.', 'Study on the Umbilical Cord-Mesenchymal Stem Cell Manufacturing Using Clinical-Grade Culture Medium.', 'Regenerative medicine strategies for hair growth and regeneration: A narrative review of literature.']"""

Aims:   To increase insight in the prevalence and cellular localization of TF expression across solid cancer types, we performed a detailed and systematic analysis of TF expression in tumor tissue obtained from patients with ovarian, esophageal, bladder, cervical, endometrial, pancreatic, prostate, colon, breast, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and glioblastoma. The spatial and temporal variation of TF expression was analyzed over time and upon disease progression in patient-matched biopsies taken at different timepoints. In addition, TF expression in patient-matched primary tumor and metastatic lesions was also analyzed.  Methods and results:   TF expression was detected via immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a validated TF-specific antibody. TF was expressed in all cancer types tested, with highest prevalence in pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, glioblastoma, HNSCC, and NSCLC, and lowest in breast cancer. Staining was predominantly membranous in pancreatic, cervical, and HNSCC, and cytoplasmic in glioblastoma and bladder cancer. In general, expression was consistent between biopsies obtained from the same patient over time, although variability was observed for individual patients. NSCLC biopsies of primary tumor and matched lymph node metastases showed no clear difference in TF expression overall, although individual patient changes were observed.

Current treatments have low or limited evidence of efficacy. It is likely that oestradiol depletion is the mediator of these hot flushes, and transdermal oestradiol might be an effective treatment.  Design:   This is a 6-month randomised, placebo-controlled trial with the hypothesis that oestradiol would reduce hot flush frequency and intensity and improve quality of life (QoL).  Methods:   Seventy-eight participants receiving ADT were randomised to 0.9 mg of 0.1% oestradiol gel per day or matched placebo. Hot flush frequency and severity were assessed by 7-day diary at baseline, month 1, month 3, and month 6. QoL was assessed by validated questionnaire.  Results:   Oestradiol reduced daily hot flush frequency, with a mean adjusted difference (MAD) of -1.6 hot flushes per day (95% CI: -2.7 to -0.5; P = 0.04). The effect on weekly hot flush score was non-significant, with a MAD -19.6 (95% CI: -35.5 to -3.8; P = 0.11). On per protocol analysis, E2 significantly reduced daily hot flush frequency, with a MAD of -2.2 hot flushes per day (95% CI: -3.2 to -1.1; P = 0.001), and weekly hot flush score, with a MAD of -27.0 (-44.7 to -9.3; P = 0.02). Oestradiol had no significant effect on QoL.  Conclusion:   We confirmed our hypothesis of a clinical effect of assignment to oestradiol to reduce hot flush frequency in men with castrate testosterone due to ADT. Transdermal oestradiol could be considered for men with burdensome hot flushes in whom other treatments have failed as long as the risk of breast effects and fat gain are considered.""","""['Nicholas Russell', 'Rudolf Hoermann', 'Ada S Cheung', 'Jeffrey D Zajac', 'Mathis Grossmann']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Eur J Endocrinol""","""['Efficacy of venlafaxine, medroxyprogesterone acetate, and cyproterone acetate for the treatment of vasomotor hot flushes in men taking gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues for prostate cancer: a double-blind, randomised trial.', 'Short-term effects of transdermal estradiol in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer: a randomized placebo-controlled trial.', 'Quality-of-life outcomes from the Prostate Adenocarcinoma: TransCutaneous Hormones (PATCH) trial evaluating luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonists versus transdermal oestradiol for androgen suppression in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Acupuncture for menopausal hot flushes.', 'Bioidentical hormones for women with vasomotor symptoms.', 'Effect of Serelys Homme on the Incidence and Severity of Vasomotor Symptoms and Quality-of-Life Impairments in Patients Receiving Hormone Therapy and Radiation for Localized Prostate Cancer: Results of the ESCULAPE Phase 2 Prospective Study.']"""

However, the receptor-ligand repertoire mediating prostate cancer (PCa) cell-platelet interactions and ensuing consequences have not been fully elucidated. Microvilli emanating from the plasma membrane of PCa cell lines (RC77 T/E, MDA PCa 2b) directly contacted individual platelets and platelet aggregates. PCa cell-platelet interactions were associated with calcium mobilization in platelets, and translocation of P-selectin and integrin αIIbβ3 onto the platelet surface. PCa cell-platelet interactions reciprocally promoted PCa cell invasion and apoptotic resistance, and these events were insensitive to androgen receptor blockade by bicalutamide. PCa cells were exceedingly sensitive to activation by platelets in vitro, occurring at a PCa cell:platelet coculture ratio as low as 1:10 (whereas PCa patient blood contains 1:2,000,000 per ml). Conditioned medium from cocultures stimulated PCa cell invasion but not apoptotic resistance nor platelet aggregation. Candidate transmembrane signaling proteins responsible for PCa cell-platelet oncogenic events were identified by RNA-Seq and broadly divided into 4 major categories: (1) integrin-ligand, (2) EPH receptor-ephrin, (3) immune checkpoint receptor-ligand, and (4) miscellaneous receptor-ligand interactions. Based on antibody neutralization and small molecule inhibitor assays, PCa cell-stimulated calcium mobilization in platelets was found to be mediated by a fibronectin1 (FN1)-αIIbβ3 signaling axis. Platelet-stimulated PCa cell invasion was facilitated by a CD55-adhesion G protein coupled receptor E5 (ADGRE5) axis, with contribution from platelet cytokines CCL3L1 and IL32. Platelet-stimulated PCa cell apoptotic resistance relied on ephrin-EPH receptor and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA)-LPA receptor (LPAR) signaling. Of participating signaling partners, FN1 and LPAR3 overexpression was observed in PCa specimens compared to normal prostate, while high expression of CCR1 (CCL3L1 receptor), EPHA1 and LPAR5 in PCa was associated with poor patient survival.

In this study, we demonstrated that SHMT2 was upregulated in ccRCC tissues compared with controls and associated with patient survival. SHMT2 knockdown inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion in ccRCC cells. Overexpression of SHMT2 promoted tumor progression. Mechanistically, SHMT2 depletion disrupted one-carbon metabolism, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and decreased ATP levels via metabolic reprogramming, which destroyed cell homeostasis. The SHMT2 knockdown-induced stress activated autophagy. A mass of autophagosomes fused with lysosomes, resulting in lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) and leakage of lysosomal contents into the cytoplasm, which eventually led to apoptosis.

Prior to beam on, patient position was set up with the US probe positioned transperineally with the aid of reference images (fused US and computed tomography images). In each fraction, prostate displacements in three directions [superior/inferior (SI), left/right (LR) and anterior/posterior (AP)] were recorded. PTV margins were determined using Van Herk's formula.

Quiescent PCa cells are also enriched for a stem-like tumor initiating population, and can lead to recurrence after dormancy. Unfortunately, quiescent PCa cells are difficult to identify and / or target with treatment in part because the relevant markers are intracellular and regulated by protein stability. We addressed this problem by utilizing PCa cells expressing fluorescent markers for CDKN1B (p27) and CDT1, which can separate viable PCa cells into G0, G1, or combined S/G2/M populations. We used FACS to collect G1 and G0 PC3 PCa cells, isolated membrane proteins, and analyzed protein abundance in G0 vs G1 cells by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Enrichment analysis identified nucleocytoplasmic transport as the most significantly different pathway. To identify cell surface proteins potentially identifying quiescent PCa cells for future patient samples or for antibody based therapeutic research, we focused on differentially abundant plasma membrane proteins, and identified ERBB2 (HER2) as a cell surface protein enriched on G0 PCa cells. High HER2 on the cell membrane is associated with quiescence in PCa cells and likely induced by the bone microenvironment. Using a drug conjugated anti-HER2 antibody (trastuzumab emtansine) in a mouse PCa xenograft model delayed metastatic tumor growth, suggesting approaches that target HER2-high cells may be beneficial in treating PCa.

However, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer (ERPC) invariably develops and progresses to metastatic, lethal disease. Management of ERPC poses a special problem not only because available therapeutic regimens cannot effectively kill ERPC cells but also due to their propensity to invade large bones. Moreover, molecular mechanism(s) behind enzalutamide resistance is not properly understood, which is delaying development of newer agents. We found that the pseudokinase, Tribbles 2 (TRIB2), is overexpressed in ERPC cells and plays a critical role in their survival. Forced overexpression of TRIB2 enhances prostate cancer cell growth and confers resistance to physiologic doses of enzalutamide, suggesting that TRIB2 plays an important role in the development and progression of ERPC. Though TRIB2 has emerged as an excellent molecular target for ERPC, suitable inhibitors are not commercially available for effective targeting. By designing a luciferase-tagged TRIB2 fusion protein-based assay system, we screened a library of about 1,600 compounds and found that daclatasvir (DCV), an antiviral drug, effectively inhibits TRIB2-luciferase. We also found that DCV degrades TRIB2 proteins by direct binding and resensitizes ERPC cells to enzalutamide treatment. Moreover, DCV at lower, sublethal doses synergizes with enzalutamide to decrease the viability and induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Because DCV is already approved by the FDA and well tolerated in humans, based on our findings, it appears that DCV is a promising new agent for development of an effective therapy for advanced, enzalutamide-resistant, lethal prostate cancer.""","""['Jitender Monga', 'Frederick Valeriote', 'Clara Hwang', 'Shirish Gadgeel', 'Jagadananda Ghosh']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Tribbles 2 pseudokinase confers enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer by promoting lineage plasticity.', 'Pharmacological and genetic targeting of 5-lipoxygenase interrupts c-Myc oncogenic signaling and kills enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells via apoptosis.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Second-Generation Androgen Receptor Antagonists as Hormonal Therapeutics for Three Forms of Prostate Cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.']"""

Results:   A total of 1,470 incident cancer cases were identified in the InGef database and 1,694 in the Cancer Registry. Data on sex, age, and tumour localisation matched well for all cancer entities in the cohorts. Data for early UICC stages I+II varied between the cohorts for prostate cancer (84% InGef, 66% Cancer Registry) and lung cancer (29% InGef, 20% Cancer Registry). Larger deviations were found for antihormonal treatment (breast 54% vs. 44%, prostate 32% vs. 18%). Significant differences were found for surgery (breast and lung) and radiation (breast and prostate), respectively.  Discussion:   Age at diagnosis, tumour localisation, and treatment for breast cancer was well documented in both databases. Tumour-specific deviations were observed for tumour localisations (lung cancer), UICC stage (prostate and lung cancer) and treatment options.

Design, setting, and participants:   We analyzed a retrospective multinational cohort from ten academic centers comprising 1476 men who underwent a combined prostate biopsy (MRI targeted plus systematic biopsy) between February 2012 and April 2021 due to a PI-RADS 3 lesion in prostate MRI.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was the detection of sPC (ISUP ≥2) in a combined biopsy. Predictors were identified by a regression analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied to evaluate the hypothetical effect of involving PSAD into biopsy decision.  Results and limitations:   Of all patients, 273/1476 (18.5%) were diagnosed with sPC. MRI-targeted biopsy diagnosed fewer sPC cases than combined strategy: 183/1476 (12.4%) versus 273/1476 (18.5%), p < 0.01. Age (odds ratio [OR] 1.10 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.05-1.15], p < 0.001), prior negative biopsy (OR 0.46 [0.24-0.89], p = 0.022), and PSAD (p < 0.001) were found to be independent predictors of sPC. Applying a PSAD cutoff of 0.15, 817/1398 (58.4%) biopsies would have been avoided at the cost of missing sPC in 91 (6.5%) men. Limitations were the retrospective design, heterogeneity of the study cohort due to the long inclusion period, and no central revision of MRI.  Conclusions:   Age, previous biopsy status, and PSAD were found to be independent predictors of sPC in men with equivocal prostate MRI. Implementation of PSAD into biopsy decision can avoid unnecessary biopsies. Clinical parameters such as PSAD need validation in a prospective setting.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in development and progression of prostate cancer is essential to improve both diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in this regard. In addition, using novel gene therapy-based methods for treatment of cancers has gotten increasing attention during the recent years. Accordingly, this study was aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effect of MAGE-A11 gene, as an important oncogene involved in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer invitro model. The study was also aimed to evaluate the downstream genes related to MAGE-A11.  Materials and methods:   First, MAGE-A11 gene was knocked out in PC-3 cell line using ""Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats"" (CRISPR)/ ""CRISPR-associated genes 9"" (CRISPR/Cas9) method. Next, the expression levels of MAGE-A11, survivin and Ribonucleotide Reductase Small Subunit M2 (RRM2) genes were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique. The levels of proliferation and apoptosis were also analyzed in PC-3 cells using CCK-8 and Annexin V-PE/7-AAD assays.  Results:   The results showed that the disruption of MAGE-A11 by CRISPR/Cas9 method significantly decreased proliferation (P< 0.0001) and enhanced apoptosis (P< 0.05) in PC-3 cells compared to control group. Moreover, the disruption of MAGE-A11 significantly down regulated the expression levels of survivin and RRM2 genes (P< 0.05).  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrated that knocking out MAGE-11 gene by CRISPR/CAS9 technique could efficiently inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in PC3 cells.

Among them, compound 7c exhibited potent antitumor activity against prostate cancer cell PC3 in vitro and in vivo via inducing apoptosis. We investigated the significantly differentially expressed proteins in the cells caused by the compound 7c to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of PCa cell growth, which indicated that 7c mainly regulated the protein expression of apoptosis-related transcription factors, including c-Jun, IL6, LAMB3, OSMR, STC1, OLR1, SDC4 and PLAU; and 7c also regulated the protein expression of inflammatory cytokines including IL6, CXCL8, TNFSF9, TNFRSF12A and OSMR, and the phosphorylation levels of RelA. The action target confirmed that TNFSF9 protein is the critical binding target of 7c.

Methods:   A single radiologist reported 791 mpMRI scans for query prostate cancer between 2017 and 2019. A structured template which included histological outcome data from this cohort was devised and included in 207 mpMRI reports between January and June 2021. The outcomes of the new cohort were compared with the historical cohort, and with 160 contemporaneous reports without histological outcome data from the four other radiologists in the department. The opinion of this template was sought from referring clinicians who counselled patients.  Results:   The proportion of patients biopsied fell from 58.0 to 32.9% overall between the n = 791 cohort and the n = 207 cohort. This was most noticeable in those scoring Likert 3, where the proportion biopsied fell from 78.4 to 42.9%. This reduction was also seen when comparing the biopsy rates of patients scored Likert 3 by other reporters in a contemporaneous n = 160 cohort without the audit information (65.2%) with the n = 207 cohort (42.9%). 100% of counselling clinicians were in favour and 66.7% said it gave them greater confidence to advise the patient when they did not need a biopsy.

The multivariate analysis was performed on factors that reduce ULR and found that the following factors were associated with ULR: younger age, NS and Retzius-sparing, which were significant. Additionally, dynamic MRI findings showed that membranous urethral length and the anterior rectal wall movement toward the pubic bone during abdominal pressure were significant factors. The movement observed on the dynamic MRI during abdominal pressure was thought to reflect an effective urethral sphincter closure mechanism.

This includes chemically staining the transparent tissue sections to make them visible to the human eye. Although chemical staining is fast and routine, it permanently alters the tissue and often consumes hazardous reagents. On the other hand, on using adjacent tissue sections for combined measurements, the cell-wise resolution is lost owing to sections representing different parts of the tissue. Hence, techniques providing visual information of the basic tissue structure enabling additional measurements from the exact same tissue section are required. Here we tested unstained tissue imaging for the development of computational hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. We used unsupervised deep learning (CycleGAN) and whole slide images of prostate tissue sections to compare the performance of imaging tissue in paraffin, as deparaffinized in air, and as deparaffinized in mounting medium with section thicknesses varying between 3 and 20 μm. We showed that although thicker sections increase the information content of tissue structures in the images, thinner sections generally perform better in providing information that can be reproduced in virtual staining. According to our results, tissue imaged in paraffin and as deparaffinized provides a good overall representation of the tissue for virtually HE-stained images. Further, using a pix2pix model, we showed that the reproduction of overall tissue histology can be clearly improved with image-to-image translation using supervised learning and pixel-wise ground truth. We also showed that virtual HE staining can be used for various tissues and used with both 20× and 40× imaging magnifications. Although the performance and methods of virtual staining need further development, our study provides evidence of the feasibility of whole slide unstained microscopy as a fast, cheap, and feasible approach to producing virtual staining of tissue histology while sparing the exact same tissue section ready for subsequent utilization with follow-up methods at single-cell resolution.""","""['Sonja Koivukoski', 'Umair Khan', 'Pekka Ruusuvuori', 'Leena Latonen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Lab Invest""","""['Use of Deep Learning to Develop and Analyze Computational Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining of Prostate Core Biopsy Images for Tumor Diagnosis.', 'Multi-institutional comparison of whole slide digital imaging and optical microscopy for interpretation of hematoxylin-eosin-stained breast tissue sections.', 'Open-Top Light-Sheet Microscopy Image Atlas of Prostate Core Needle Biopsies.', 'Utility of whole slide imaging and virtual microscopy in prostate pathology.', 'Whole slide imaging: uses and limitations for surgical pathology and teaching.', 'Addressing persistent challenges in digital image analysis of cancerous tissues.', 'The effect of neural network architecture on virtual H&E staining: Systematic assessment of histological feasibility.']"""

Previous studies suggested that FC patterns derived from task fMRI paradigms, which we refer to as task-based FC, are better correlated with individual differences in behavior than resting-state FC, but the consistency and generalizability of this advantage across task conditions was not fully explored. Using data from resting-state fMRI and three fMRI tasks from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study ® (ABCD), we tested whether the observed improvement in behavioral prediction power of task-based FC can be attributed to changes in brain activity induced by the task design. We decomposed the task fMRI time course of each task into the task model fit (the fitted time course of the task condition regressors from the single-subject general linear model) and the task model residuals, calculated their respective FC, and compared the behavioral prediction performance of these FC estimates to resting-state FC and the original task-based FC. The FC of the task model fit was better than the FC of the task model residual and resting-state FC at predicting a measure of general cognitive ability or two measures of performance on the fMRI tasks. The superior behavioral prediction performance of the FC of the task model fit was content-specific insofar as it was only observed for fMRI tasks that probed similar cognitive constructs to the predicted behavior of interest. To our surprise, the task model parameters, the beta estimates of the task condition regressors, were equally if not more predictive of behavioral differences than all FC measures. These results showed that the observed improvement of behavioral prediction afforded by task-based FC was largely driven by the FC patterns associated with the task design.

However, providing people with cancer with easily accessible, high-quality exercise support and programs is a challenge. Therefore, there is a need to develop easily accessible exercise programs that draw upon the current evidence. Supervised, distance-based exercise programs have the benefit of reaching out to many people whilst providing the support of an exercise professional. The aim of the EX-MED Cancer Sweden trial is to examine the effectiveness of a supervised, distance-based exercise program, in people previously treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), as well as other physiological and patient-reported health outcomes.  Methods:   The EX-MED Cancer Sweden trial is a prospective randomised controlled trial including 200 people that have completed curative treatment for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. Participants are randomly allocated to an exercise group or a routine care control group. The exercise group will participate in a supervised, distanced-based exercise program delivered by a personal trainer who has undertaken specialised exercise oncology education modules. The intervention consists of a combination of resistance and aerobic exercises with participants completing two 60-min sessions per week for 12 weeks. The primary outcome is HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30) assessed at baseline, 3- (end of intervention and primary endpoint) and 6-months post-baseline. Secondary outcomes are physiological (cardiorespiratory fitness, muscle strength, physical function, body composition) and patient-reported outcomes (cancer-related symptoms, fatigue, self-reported physical activity), and self-efficacy of exercise. Furthermore, the trial will explore and describe the experiences of participation in the exercise intervention.  Discussion:   The EX-MED Cancer Sweden trial will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of a supervised, distance-based exercise program for survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer. If successful, it will contribute to the implementation of flexible and effective exercise programs as part of the standard of care for people following cancer treatment, which is likely to contribute to a reduction in the burden of cancer on the individual, health care system and society.

To develop effective BCa treatments, there is an urgent need to understand the differences in the BCa control mechanisms based on gender. Our recent clinical study showed that androgen suppression therapy using 5α-reductase inhibitors and androgen deprivation therapy affects BCa progression, but the underlying mechanisms are still unknown.  Methods:   mRNA expression levels of the androgen receptor (AR) and SLC39A9 (membrane AR) in T24 and J82 BCa cells were evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). The effect of dutasteride, a 5α-reductase inhibitor, in BCa progression was determined in cells transfected with control and AR-overexpressing plasmids. In addition, cell viability and migration assays, RT-PCR, and western blot analysis were performed to analyze the effect of dutasteride on BCa in the presence of testosterone. Finally, steroidal 5α-reductase 1 (SRD5A1), one of the dutasteride target genes, was silenced in T24 and J82 BCa cells using control and shRNA-containing plasmids, and the oncogenic role of SRD5A1 was evaluated.  Results:   Dutasteride treatment led to significant inhibition of the testosterone-induced increase dependent on AR and SLC39A9 in cell viability and migration of T24 and J82 BCa cells and induced alterations in the expression level of cancer progression proteins, such as metalloproteases, p21, BCL-2, NF-KB, and WNT in AR-negative BCa. Furthermore, the bioinformatic analysis showed that mRNA expression levels of SRD5A1 were significantly higher in BCa tissues than in normal paired tissues. A positive correlation between SRD5A1 expression and poor patient survival was observed in patients with BCa. Also, Dutasteride treatment reduced cell proliferation and migration via blocking the SRD5A1 in BCa.  Conclusions:   Dutasteride inhibited testosterone-induced BCa progression dependent on SLC39A9 in AR-negative BCa and repressed oncogenic signaling pathways, including those of metalloproteases, p21, BCL-2, NF-KB, and WNT. Our results also suggest that SRD5A1 plays a pro-oncogenic role in BCa.

The mechanism underlying PCa progression is still not clear. This study observed that NRP1 was highly expressed in PCa and associated with poor prognosis in PCa patients. Functionally, NRP1 depletion attenuated the proliferation and migration ability of PCa cells in vitro and in vivo, while NRP1 overexpression promoted PCa cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, it was observed that NRP1 depletion induced G1 phase arrest in PCa cells. Mechanistically, HIF1α is bound to the specific promoter region of NRP1, thereby regulating its transcriptional activation. Subsequently, NRP1 interacted with EGFR, leading to EGFR phosphorylation. This study also provided evidence that the b1/b2 domain of NRP1 was responsible for the interaction with the extracellular domain of EGFR. Moreover, EGFR mediated NRP1-induced activation of the AKT signaling pathway, which promoted the malignant progression of PCa. In addition, the administration of NRP1 inhibitor EG01377 significantly inactivated the EGFR/AKT signaling axis, thereby suppressing PCa progression. In conclusion, the findings from this study highlighted the molecular mechanism underlying NRP1 expression in PCa and provide a potential predictor and therapeutic target for clinical prognosis and treatment of PCa.""","""['Peng Zhang#', 'Liang Chen#', 'Fenfang Zhou', 'Zhiwen He', 'Gang Wang', 'Yongwen Luo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['CMTM5 inhibits the development of prostate cancer via the EGFR/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.', 'LncRNA RHPN1-AS1 inhibition induces autophagy and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via the miR-7-5p/EGFR/PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.', 'Vascular endothelial growth factor regulates myeloid cell leukemia-1 expression through neuropilin-1-dependent activation of c-MET signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'The regulation of Neuropilin 1 expression by miR-338-3p promotes non-small cell lung cancer via changes in EGFR signaling.', 'The PI3K/AKT pathway in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer.', '6-Methoxydihydrosanguinarine exhibits cytotoxicity and sensitizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells through ROS-mediated upregulation of DR5.', 'Immune Checkpoint Neuropilins as Novel Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets for Pancreatic Cancer.']"""

Methods:   The Prostatectomy, Incontinence and Erectile dysfunction study recruited patients at 2 US institutions between 2011 and 2014. At baseline, height and weight were measured, and urinary and sexual function were collected by the modified Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-50. This index was repeated at the 5-week, 6-month, and 12-month postsurgical assessments and compared to baseline using linear generalized estimating equations. Logistic equations were used to evaluate the likelihood of functional recovery at the 6- and 12-month assessments.  Result:   Presurgery, nonobese patients (68.8% of 407 patients) had similar urinary function as those with obesity (P = .217), but better sexual function (P = .006). One year after surgery, 50.5% and 28.9% patients had recovered to baseline levels for urinary and sexual function, respectively. Recovery was not, however, uniform by obesity. Compared to those with obesity, nonobese patients had better urinary function at the 6- (P < .001) and 12-month postsurgical assessments (P = .011) and were more likely to recover their function by the 6-month assessment (OR = 2.55, 95% CI = 1.36-4.76). For sexual function, nonobese patients had better function at the 6- (P = .028) and 12-month (P = .051) assessments, but a similar likelihood of recovery 1-year postsurgery.  Conclusion:   Nonobese prostate cancer patients had better and likely earlier recovery in urinary function postsurgery, and better sexual function both pre- and postsurgery.

Methods:   Population-based cohort study of Australian men (n = 2793,882) aged 50-69 who received at least one PSA test (Medicare Benefit Schedule item number 66655) during 2002-2018. Outcome measures included age-standardised participation rate, annual percentage change using JoinPoint regression and indirectly standardised participation rate ratio using multivariable Poisson regression.  Results:   During 2005-09, two thirds (68%) of Australian men aged 50-69 had at least one PSA test, reducing to about half (48%) during 2014-18. In both periods, testing rates were highest among men living in major cities, men aged 50-59 years, and among men living in the most advantaged areas.

This pattern was generally consistent across States and Territories, and socio-economic areas, however the magnitude of the trends was less pronounced in remote and very remote areas.  Conclusions:   The decreasing trends are consistent with a greater awareness of the current guidelines for clinical practice in Australia, which recommend a PSA test be done only with the informed consent of individual men who understand the potential benefits and risks.

Moreover, the tumor microenvironment is an essential part of cancer homeostasis. Previously, it was shown that cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are present in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, particularly in the mesenchymal stroma cells, at levels comparable to those of hepatocytes. It was found that the CYPs play important roles in nurturing and maintaining normal hematopoietic stem cells as well as multiple myeloma and leukemia cells, including protecting them from toxic insults. It was hypothesized that the CYPs in the BM microenvironment might play a similar role in solid tumors metastatic to bone.  Methods:   The interaction between the BM microenvironment and malignant cells that routinely metastasize to the bone (lung, breast, and prostate cancer) was modeled. Via genetic engineering and pharmacological approaches, the role of stromal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) in drug resistance promoted by the BM microenvironment in niche-cancer models in vitro and in vivo was interrogated.  Results:   BM stroma protected prostate, breast, and lung cancer cells from cytotoxic chemotherapy. Stromal CYP3A4 was at least partially responsible for this protection in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, inhibiting CYP3A4 with clarithromycin overcame the stroma-mediated chemoresistance toward prostate, breast, and lung cancer cells.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that, similar to observations from hematologic malignancies, the BM microenvironment, through expression of CYPs, creates a sanctuary site from chemotherapy for metastatic solid tumors.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is a minimally invasive biopsy technique, less traumatic compared to core needle biopsy, and could be useful for diagnosis of PC. Molecular biomarkers (BMs) in FNA-samples can be assessed for prediction, eg of immunotherapy efficacy before treatment as well as at treatment decision time points during disease progression.  Methods:   In the present pilot study, the expression levels of 151 BM proteins were analysed by proximity extension assay in FNA-samples from 16 patients, including benign prostate lesions (n = 3) and cancers (n = 13). An ensemble data analysis strategy was applied using several machine learning models.  Results:   Twelve potentially predictive BM proteins correlating with International Society of Urological Pathology grade groups were identified, among them vimentin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2, and integrin beta-5. The validity of the results was supported by network analysis that showed functional associations between most of the identified putative BMs. We also showed that multiple immune checkpoint targets can be assessed (eg PD-L1, CD137, and Galectin-9), which may support the selection of immunotherapy in advanced PC.

The development of time-stable dosage forms of radiopharmaceuticals is the key to their successful implementation in clinical practice. Using [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 molecule as an example, the time dependence of the change in radiochemical purity (RCP, %) under radiolysis conditions was studied. The dependence of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 radiolysis on parameters such as time, radionuclide activity, buffer agent concentration, precursor amount, and preparation volume was evaluated. It was shown that the absorbed dose was the dominant factor influencing the RCP. The RCP value is inversely proportional to the absorbed dose in the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 preparation and has an exponential dependence. The lutetium-177 dose factor ψ (Gy·mL·MBq-1) and PSMA-617 concentration-dependent dose constant κ (Gy-1) were evaluated for absorbed dose estimation via computer modeling, chemical dosimetry, and radiochemical purity monitoring under various conditions. The further refinement and application of the dependencies found can be useful for predicting the RCP value at the stage of optimizing the composition of the finished dosage form of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. The influence of the buffer agent (sodium acetate) concentration on [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 radiolytic degradation was shown and should be considered both when developing a dosage form, and when comparing the results of independent studies. The effectiveness of the addition of various stabilizing agents, such as DMSA, cysteine, gentisic acid, vanillin, methionine, adenine, dobesilic acid, thymine, uracil, nicotinamide, meglumine, and mannitol, in suppressing the effects of radiolysis was evaluated.""","""['Anton Larenkov', 'Iurii Mitrofanov', 'Ekaterina Pavlenko', 'Marat Rakhimov']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Preparation of 177Lu-PSMA-617 in Hospital Radiopharmacy: Convenient Formulation of a Clinical Dose Using a Single-Vial Freeze-Dried PSMA-617 Kit Developed In-House.', 'Effectiveness of quenchers to reduce radiolysis of (111)In- or (177)Lu-labelled methionine-containing regulatory peptides.

The NCCT attenuation, measured in Hounsfield units (HU), has been evaluated to predict stone characteristics. We propose a novel parameter, linear calculus density (LCD), and analyze variables from NCCT imaging to predict calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones, which are common and challenging to fragment. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with urolithiasis between 2014 and 2017. Among those, 790 patients were included. Based on the NCCT pre-treatment, the maximal stone length (MSL), mean stone density (MSD), and stone heterogeneity index (SHI) were obtained. In addition, the variation coefficient of stone density (VCSD = SHI/MSD × 100) and linear calculus density (LCD = VCSD/MSL) were calculated. In accordance with the stone analysis, the patients were divided into two groups (CaOx and non-CaOx groups). The logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used for predictive modeling. Results: In the CaOx group, the SHI, VCSD, and LCD were more significant than in the non-CaOx group (all p < 0.001). SHI (OR 1.002, 95% CI 1.001-1.004, p < 0.001), VCSD (OR 1.028, 95% CI 1.016-1.041, p < 0.001), and LCD (OR 1.352, 95% CI 1.270-1.444, p < 0.001) were significant independent factors for CaOx stones in the logistic regression models. The areas under the ROC curve for predicting CaOx stones were 0.586 for SHI, 0.66 for VCSD, and 0.739 for LCD, with a cut-point of 2.25.

This study assessed the biological interaction of different morphologies of AuNPs with ionizing radiation (IR) in PCa cells. To achieve that aim, three different amine-pegylated AuNPs were synthesized with distinct sizes and shapes (spherical, AuNPsp-PEG, star, AuNPst-PEG, and rods, AuNPr-PEG) and viability, injury and colony assays were used to analyze their biological effect on PCa cells (PC3, DU145, and LNCaP) when submitted to the accumulative fraction of RT. The combinatory effect of AuNPs with IR decreased cell viability and increased apoptosis compared to cells treated only with IR or untreated cells. Additionally, our results showed an increase in the sensitization enhancement ratio by cells treated with AuNPs and IR, and this effect is cell line dependent.

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein for cell entry, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the Spike (S) protein by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), allowing fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. Interestingly, TMPRSS2 is a key regulator in prostate cancer (PCa) progression which is regulated by androgen receptor (AR) signaling. Our hypothesis is that the AR signaling may regulate the expression of TMPRSS2 in human respiratory cells and thus influence the membrane fusion entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2. We show here that TMPRSS2 and AR are expressed in Calu-3 lung cells. In this cell line, TMPRSS2 expression is regulated by androgens. Finally, pre-treatment with anti-androgen drugs such as apalutamide significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection in Calu-3 lung cells but also in primary human nasal epithelial cells.

Its prevention has been limited because of an incomplete understanding of how environmental exposures to chemicals contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of aggressive PCa. Environmental exposures to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may mimic hormones involved in PCa development. This research aims to identify EDCs associated with PCa hub genes and/or transcription factors (TF) of these hub genes in addition to their protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. We are expanding upon the scope of our previous work, using six PCa microarray datasets, namely, GSE46602, GSE38241, GSE69223, GSE32571, GSE55945, and GSE26126, from the NCBI/GEO, to select differentially expressed genes based on |log2FC| (fold change) ≥ 1 and an adjusted p-value < 0.05. An integrated bioinformatics analysis was used for enrichment analysis (using DAVID.6.8, GO, KEGG, STRING, MCODE, CytoHubba, and GeneMANIA). Next, we validated the association of these PCa hub genes in RNA-seq PCa cases and controls from TCGA. The influence of environmental chemical exposures, including EDCs, was extrapolated using the chemical toxicogenomic database (CTD). A total of 369 overlapping DEGs were identified associated with biological processes, such as cancer pathways, cell division, response to estradiol, peptide hormone processing, and the p53 signaling pathway. Enrichment analysis revealed five up-regulated (NCAPG, MKI67, TPX2, CCNA2, CCNB1) and seven down-regulated (CDK1, CCNB2, AURKA, UBE2C, BUB1B, CENPF, RRM2) hub gene expressions. Expression levels of these hub genes were significant in PCa tissues with high Gleason scores ≥ 7.

Moreover, currently available therapeutic options for the treatment of PC are still limited, being mainly focused on androgen deprivation therapies and being characterized by low efficacy in patients. As a consequence, there is a pressing need to identify alternative and more effective therapeutics. In this study, we performed large-scale 2D and 3D similarity analyses between compounds reported in the DrugBank database and ChEMBL molecules with reported anti-proliferative activity on various PC cell lines. The analyses included also the identification of biological targets of ligands with potent activity on PC cells, as well as investigations on the activity annotations and clinical data associated with the more relevant compounds emerging from the ligand-based similarity results.

This study evaluates whether PARP-1, on account of its proximity to the cell's DNA, would be a good target for delivering high-linear energy transfer Auger radiation to induce lethal DNA damage in prostate cancer cells. We analyzed the correlation between PARP-1 expression and Gleason score in a prostate cancer tissue microarray. A radio-brominated Auger emitting inhibitor ([77Br]Br-WC-DZ) targeting PARP-1 was synthesized. The ability of [77Br]Br-WC-DZ to induce cytotoxicity and DNA damage was assessed in vitro. The antitumor efficacy of [77Br]Br-WC-DZ was investigated in prostate cancer xenograft models. PARP-1 expression was found to be positively correlated with the Gleason score, thus making it an attractive target for Auger therapy in advanced diseases. The Auger emitter, [77Br]Br-WC-DZ, induced DNA damage, G2-M cell cycle phase arrest, and cytotoxicity in PC-3 and IGR-CaP1 prostate cancer cells. A single dose of [77Br]Br-WC-DZ inhibited the growth of prostate cancer xenografts and improved the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

This study used genomics and proteomics data from The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), with 470 cutaneous melanoma patient data points. Cox regression analyses evaluated the association between AR protein level with overall survival and revealed that a higher level of AR protein was positively associated with a better overall survival (OS) (p = 0.003). When stratified by sex, the AR association with OS was only significant for both sexes. The multivariate Cox models with justifications of sex, age of diagnosis, stage of disease, and Breslow depth of the tumor confirmed the AR-OS association in all patients. However, the significance of AR was lost when ulceration was included in the model. When stratified by sex, the multivariate Cox models indicated significant role of AR in OS of female patients but not in males. AR-associated genes were identified and enrichment analysis revealed shared and distinct gene network in male and female patients. Furthermore, AR was found significantly associated with OS in RAS mutant subtypes of melanoma but not in BRAF, NF1, or triple-wild type subtypes of melanoma.

Due to the complexity of tumor masses, radiologists find it difficult to identify PCa accurately. Over the years, several PCa-detecting methods have been formulated, but these methods cannot identify cancer efficiently. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has both information technologies that simulate natural or biological phenomena and human intelligence in addressing issues. AI technologies have been broadly implemented in the healthcare domain, including 3D printing, disease diagnosis, health monitoring, hospital scheduling, clinical decision support, classification and prediction, and medical data analysis. These applications significantly boost the cost-effectiveness and accuracy of healthcare services. This article introduces an Archimedes Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning-based Prostate Cancer Classification (AOADLB-P2C) model on MRI images. The presented AOADLB-P2C model examines MRI images for the identification of PCa. To accomplish this, the AOADLB-P2C model performs pre-processing in two stages: adaptive median filtering (AMF)-based noise removal and contrast enhancement. Additionally, the presented AOADLB-P2C model extracts features via a densely connected network (DenseNet-161) model with a root-mean-square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. Finally, the presented AOADLB-P2C model classifies PCa using the AOA with a least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) method. The simulation values of the presented AOADLB-P2C model are tested using a benchmark MRI dataset. The comparative experimental results demonstrate the improvements of the AOADLB-P2C model over other recent approaches.""","""['Mahmoud Ragab', 'Faris Kateb', 'E K El-Sawy', 'Sami Saeed Binyamin', 'Mohammed W Al-Rabia', 'Rasha A Mansouri']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Healthcare (Basel)""","""['Hyperparameter Optimizer with Deep Learning-Based Decision-Support Systems for Histopathological Breast Cancer Diagnosis.', 'Artificial Intelligence in Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: Where Do We Stand in 2021?', 'Artificial intelligence in clinical care amidst COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review.', 'Adaptive fuzzy deformable fusion and optimized CNN with ensemble classification for automated brain tumor diagnosis.', 'A Cascaded Deep Learning-Based Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Automated Lesion Detection and Classification on Biparametric Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging.']"""

Additionally, previous investigations have utilized murine models to identify biomarkers but have not determined if the results are translatable to humans. To address these challenges, urine was collected from mice with prostate cancer and men undergoing prostate cancer biopsy and VOCs were analyzed by SPME GC-MS. Prior to analysis, SPME fibers/arrows were compared, and the fibers had enhanced sensitivity toward VOCs with a low molecular weight. The analysis of mouse urine demonstrated that VOCs could distinguish tumor-bearing mice with 100% accuracy. Linear discriminant analysis of six VOCs in human urine distinguished prostate cancer with sensitivity = 75% and specificity = 69%. Another panel of seven VOCs could classify aggressive cancer with sensitivity = 78% and specificity = 85%. These results show that VOCs have moderate accuracy in detecting prostate cancer and a superior ability to stratify aggressive tumors.

From these panels, we aimed to identify genes that elicited conserved and glycolysis-dependent changes in cellular bioenergetics across glycolysis-promoting and OXPHOS-promoting conditions. To further characterize gene sets within this panel and identify similarities and differences amongst glycolytic tumor RNA-seq profiles across a pan-cancer cohort, we then used unsupervised statistical classification of RNA-seq profiles for glycolytic cancers and non-glycolytic cancer types. Here, Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC); Head and Neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC); and Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) defined the glycolytic cancer group, while Prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), Thyroid carcinoma (THCA), and Thymoma (THYM) defined the non-glycolytic cancer group. These groups were defined based on glycolysis scoring from previous studies, where KIRC, HNSC, and LUSC had the highest glycolysis scores, meanwhile, PRAD, THCA, and THYM had the lowest.

The hybrid lytic peptide cytotoxic activity correlated with the expression of IL-13Rα2 in prostate cancer cell lines cultured as monolayers (2D) or 3D spheroids. In addition, TSA or 5-Aza-dC treatment of prostate cancer cells, particularly those with low expression of IL-13Rα2, enhanced the cells' sensitivity to the lytic peptide by increasing IL-13Rα2 expression.

However, there is considerable variability in outcomes, suggesting that molecular biomarkers-when assessed specifically at the margin tumor tissue-may be useful to stratify prognosis in this group. We used a case-cohort design for the outcome of BCR, selecting 215 patients from a cohort of 813 patients undergoing prostatectomy treated at the Johns Hopkins from 2008 to 2017 with positive margins and available clinical data. Tissue microarrays were created from the tumor adjacent to the positive margin and stained for PTEN, ERG, and Ki-67. Cases were scored dichotomously (PTEN and ERG) or by the Ki-67 staining index using previously validated protocols. The analysis used Cox proportional hazards models weighted for the case-cohort design. Overall, 20% (37/185) of evaluable cases had PTEN loss and 38% (71/185) had ERG expression, and the median Ki-67 expression was 0.42%. In multivariable analysis adjusting for the CAPRA-S score, adjuvant radiation, and grade group at the positive margin, ERG-positive tumors were associated with a higher risk of BCR compared to those that were ERGnegative (hazard ratio [HR], 2.4; 95% CI, 1.2-4.9; P = .012) regardless of PTEN status at the margin, and adding ERG to clinicopathologic variables increased the concordance index from 0.827 to 0.847. PTEN loss was associated with an increased risk of BCR on univariable analysis (HR, 3.19; 95% CI, 1.72-5.92; P = .0002), but this association did not remain after adjusting for clinicopathologic variables (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.49-2.29; P = .890). Thus, in the setting of prostate tumors with positive surgical margins after prostatectomy, ERG-positive tumors with or without PTEN loss at the positive margin are associated with a significantly higher risk of BCR after adjusting for clinicopathologic variables.

Among AA men with PSA 4-10 ng/mL, the proportion of men who proceeded to biopsy upon physician recommendation was determined.  Results:   Two hundred nine patients met primary criteria; 91 (43.5%) of which had csPCA. The area under the curve for PHI predicting csPCa was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61-0.75). Using a phi threshold of <23.0 to avoid biopsy provided 98.9% sensitivity, 9.3% specificity, and would have avoided 4.7% of biopsies. The proportion of those who proceeded to biopsy upon physician recommendation was 81.8%.  Conclusions:   PHI demonstrated limited performance in our cohort, with current stratifications featuring misleadingly low cancer detection rates for these men. Furthermore, PHI had limited use to avoid prostate biopsy, as the proposed threshold of 23.0 only allowed 4.7% of men to avoid biopsy. Further work is needed to assess and optimize PHI usage in AA men; nonetheless, it may still have use in increasing compliance with biopsy recommendation.""","""['Kostantinos E Morris', 'Srinath Kotamarti', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Judd W Moul']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urology""","""['EDITORIAL COMMENT.', 'Extended use of Prostate Health Index and percentage of -2pro-prostate-specific antigen in Chinese men with prostate specific antigen 10-20 ng/mL and normal digital rectal examination.', 'MRI Fusion-Targeted Transrectal Prostate Biopsy and the Role of Prostate-Specific Antigen Density and Prostate Health Index for the Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer in Southeast Asian Men.', 'Do PHI and PHI density improve detection of clinically significant prostate cancer only in the PSA gray zone?', 'Prostate Health Index density improves detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Prostate health index vs percent free prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer detection in men with ""gray"" prostate-specific antigen levels at first biopsy: systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

It is ubiquitous in the environment and greatly endangers people's health. Several studies have reported that being exposed to it can promote the development of lung cancer, breast cancer, hepatoma, and multiple myeloma. However, there are still few studies on the specific molecular mechanism and prevention methods of DBP promoting the progression of prostate cancer. This study, in silico, in vitro and in vivo, aims to explore the promoting effect of DBP on prostate cancer cell proliferation. In silico analysis, we obtained a set of DBP interactive genes by utilizing TCGA, CTD and GEO database. These genes are mainly enriched in cell cycle regulatory pathways and they have high degree of homogeneity. We found that these genes shared one transcription factor - Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) by performing Chip-X Enrichment Analysis (Version 3.0). FOXM1, once called the 2010 Molecule of the Year, aberrantly expressed in up to 20 kinds of tumors. In vitro experiments, we used DBP at concentrations of 10-8 M and 5 * 10-7 M to treat C4-2 and PC3 cells for 6 days, respectively. Cell viability was promoted significantly. When Natura-α was added in the background of above-mentioned concentration of DBP, this effect was significantly inhibited. In addition, we also found that DBP can interfering with the efficacy of enzalutamide therapy. The introduction of Natura-α can also reverse this phenomenon. In vivo, subcutaneous tumor formation experiments in nude mice, 800 mg/kg/day DBP can promote the growth of prostate cancer. This phenomenon was suppressed when Natura-α (100 mg/kg/day) was added. Based on the results of the above three levels, we confirmed that DBP can target FOXM1 to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation. Natura-α can reverse its cancer-promoting effect. This study provides new insights into the impact of DBP on prostate cancer.""","""['Hengtao Bu', 'Sensheng Tang', 'Guiting Liu', 'Chenkui Miao', 'Xiang Zhou', 'Haiwei Yang', 'Bianjiang Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Toxicology""","""['Natura-alpha targets forkhead box m1 and inhibits androgen-dependent and -independent prostate cancer growth and invasion.', 'Maternal exposure to Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) aggravate gestational diabetes mellitus via FoxM1 suppression by pSTAT1 signalling.', 'Targeting Prostate Cancer Subtype 1 by Forkhead Box M1 Pathway Inhibition.', 'FOXM1 (Forkhead box M1) in tumorigenesis: overexpression in human cancer, implication in tumorigenesis, oncogenic functions, tumor-suppressive properties, and target of anticancer therapy.', 'Regulation of the master regulator FOXM1 in cancer.', 'Critical Response to Article ""Integrated Network Pharmacology and Experimental Validation Approach to Investigate the Mechanisms of Stigmasterol in the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis"" Letter.']"""

We propose a novel approach by representing the beamlet intensities using an incomplete wavelet basis that explicitly excludes fluctuating intensity maps from the decision space (explicit hard constraint). This technique provides a built-in wavelet-induced smoothness that improves both dosimetric plan quality and delivery efficiency.Approach.The beamlet intensity maps need to be especially smooth in the leaf travel direction (referred to as theX-direction). We treat the intensity map of each beam as a 2D image and represent it using the wavelets corresponding to low-frequency changes in theX-direction (i.e. approximation and horizontal). The absence of wavelets corresponding to high-frequency changes (i.e. vertical and diagonal) induces built-in smoothness. We still utilize a regularization term in the objective function to promote smoothness in theY-direction (perpendicular to theX-direction) and further possible smoothness in theX-direction. This technique has been tested on three patient cases of different disease sites (paraspinal, lung, prostate) and all final evaluations and comparisons have been performed on an FDA-approved commercial treatment planning system (Varian EclipseTM).Main results.Wavelet-induced smoothness reduced monitor units by about 10%, 45%, and 14% for paraspinal, lung, and prostate cases, respectively. It also improved organ at risk sparing, especially on the complex paraspinal case where it resulted in about 7%, 13%, and 14% less mean dose to esophagus, lung, and cord, respectively. Moreover, built-in wavelet-induced smoothness desensitizes the results to changing the weight associated to the regularization term, and thereby mitigates the weight fine-tuning difficulty.Significance.Fluence smoothness is often achieved by smoothing the beamlet intensity maps using a proper regularization term in the objective function aiming at disincentivizing fluctuation in the beamlet intensities (implicit soft constraint). This work reports a novel application of wavelets in imposing an explicit smoothness hard constraint in the search space using an incomplete wavelet basis. This idea has been successfully applied to exclude complex and clinically irrelevant radiation plans from the search space.

The method aims to reach around 41 °C-47 °C in the tumor site by exciting magnetic nanoparticles with an externally applied alternating magnetic field (AMF), where cell death is expected to occur. Applying AMFs with high spatial resolution is still a challenge. The AMFs from current and prospective MFH applicators cover relatively large areas; being not suitable for patients having metallic implants near the treatment area. Thus, there will be a clinical need for smaller magnetic field applicators. To this end, a laparoscopic induction heater (LIH) and a transrectal induction heater (TRIH) were developed.Methods:Miniature 'pancake' coils were wound and inserted into 3D printed enclosures. Ovarian (SKOV-3, A2780) and prostate (PC-3, LNCaP) cancer cell lines were used to evaluate the instruments' capabilities in killing cancer cellsin vitro, using Synomag®-D nanoparticles as the heat mediators. NIH3T3 normal cell lines were also used with both devices to observe if these cells tolerated the conditions applied.Results:Magnetic field intensities reached by the LIH and TRIH were 42.6 kA m-1at 326 kHz and 26.3 kA m-1at 303 kHz, respectively. Temperatures reached in the samples were 41 °C by the LIH and 43 °C by the TRIH.

The purpose of this work is to investigate if integrating MCO with conventional KBP can further improve treatment plan quality for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A two-phase study was designed to investigate the impact of MCO and KBP in prostate SBRT treatment planning. The first phase involved the creation of a KBP model based on thirty clinical SBRT plans, generated by manual optimization (KBP_M). A ten-patient validation cohort was used to compare manual, MCO, and KBP_M optimization techniques. The next phase involved replanning the original model cohort with additional tradeoff optimization via MCO to create a second model, KBP_MCO. Plans were then generated using linear integration (KBP_M+MCO), non-linear integration (KBP_MCO), and a combination of integration methods (KBP_MCO+MCO). All plans were analyzed for planning target volume (PTV) coverage, OAR constraints, and plan quality metrics. Comparisons were generated to evaluate plan and model quality. Phase 1 highlighted the necessity of KBP and MCO in treatment planning, as both optimization methods improved plan quality metrics (Conformity and Heterogeneity Indices) and reduced mean rectal dose by 2 Gy, as compared to manual planning. Integrating MCO with KBP did not further improve plan quality, as little significance was seen over KBP or MCO alone. Principal component score (PCS) fitting showed KBP_MCO improved bladder and rectum estimated and modeled dose correlation by 5% and 22%, respectively; however, model improvements did not significantly impact plan quality. KBP and MCO have shown to reduce OAR dose while maintaining desired PTV coverage in this study. Further integration of KBP and MCO did not show marked improvements in treatment plan quality while requiring increased time in model generation and optimization time.""","""['Sandun Jayarathna', 'Xinglei Shen', 'Ronald C Chen', 'H Harold Li', 'Kenny Guida']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Optimization of stereotactic body radiotherapy treatment planning using a multicriteria optimization algorithm.', 'Impact of database quality in knowledge-based treatment planning for prostate cancer.', 'Dosimetric and planning efficiency comparison for lung SBRT: CyberKnife vs VMAT vs knowledge-based VMAT.', 'Volumetric-modulated arc therapy planning using multicriteria optimization for localized prostate cancer.', 'Multicriteria optimization informed VMAT planning.']"""

In this study, we sought to identify dosimetric and patient-related predictors of acute rectal toxicity.  Methods:   Patients included in this study were treated with prostate SBRT on a prospective institutional protocol. Physician-graded toxicity and patient-reported outcomes were captured at one week, one month, and three months following SBRT. DVH data were extracted and converted into relative volume differential DVHs for NTCP modeling. Patient- and disease-related covariates along with NTCP model predictions were independently tested for significant association with physician-graded toxicity or a decline in bowel-related QoL. A multivariate model was constructed using forward selection, and significant parameter cutoff values were obtained with Fischer's exact test to group patients by risk of developing physician-graded toxicity or detriments in patient-reported QoL.  Results:   One hundred and three patients treated for localized prostate cancer with SBRT were included in our analysis. 52% of patients experienced a clinically significant decline in bowel-related QOL within 1 week of completion of treatment, while only 27.5% of patients developed grade 2+ physician-graded rectal toxicity. Sequential feature selection multivariate logistic regression identified rectal V22.5 Gy (p = 0.001) and D19% (p = 0.001) as independent predictors of clinically significant toxicity, while rectal V20Gy (p = 0.004) and D25.3% (p = 0.007) were independently correlated with physician-graded toxicity. Global multivariate step-wise logistic regression identified only D19% (p = 0.001) and V20Gy (p = 0.004) as independent predictors of acute bowel bother or physician-graded rectal toxicity respectively.  Conclusions:   Moderate doses to large rectal volumes, D19% and V20Gy, were associated with an increased incidence of a clinically significant decrease in patient-reported bowel QOL and physician-scored grade 2+ rectal toxicity, respectively.

Objectives:   The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic potential of FT-6876, a new CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitor, in breast cancer models with a range of AR levels in vitro and in vivo.  Methods:   Effects of FT-6876 on the CBP/p300 pathway were determined by combining chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) complemented with H3K27 acetylation (Ac) and transcriptional profiling. The antiproliferative effect of FT-6876 was also measured in vitro and in vivo.  Results:   We describe the discovery of FT-6876, a potent and selective CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitor. The combination of ChIP and PRO-seq confirmed the reduction in H3K27Ac at specific promoter sites concurrent with a decrease in CBP/p300 on the chromatin and a reduction in nascent RNA and enhancer RNA. This was associated with a time- and concentration-dependent reduction in H3K37Ac associated with a decrease in AR and estrogen receptor (ER) target gene expression. This led to a time-dependent growth inhibition in AR+ models, correlated with AR expression. Tumor growth inhibition was also observed in AR+ tumor models of TNBC and ER+ breast cancer subtypes with consistent pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.  Conclusion:   Our findings demonstrate FT-6876 as a promising new CBP/p300 bromodomain inhibitor, with efficacy in preclinical models of AR+ breast cancer.""","""['Maureen Caligiuri', 'Grace L Williams', 'Jennifer Castro', 'Linda Battalagine', 'Erik Wilker', 'Lili Yao', 'Shawn Schiller', 'Angela Toms', 'Ping Li', 'Eneida Pardo', 'Bradford Graves', 'Joey Azofeifa', 'Agustin Chicas', 'Torsten Herbertz', 'Maria Lai', 'Joel Basken', 'Kenneth W Wood', 'Qunli Xu', 'Sylvie M Guichard']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Target Oncol""","""['CBP/p300: Critical Co-Activators for Nuclear Steroid Hormone Receptors and Emerging Therapeutic Targets in Prostate and Breast Cancers.', 'Pharmacological Inhibition of CBP/p300 Blocks Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) Function through Suppressing Enhancer H3K27 Acetylation in Luminal Breast Cancer.', 'Inhibition of the acetyltransferases p300 and CBP reveals a targetable function for p300 in the survival and invasion pathways of prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Y08197 is a novel and selective CBP/EP300 bromodomain inhibitor for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Genomic occupancy of the transcriptional co-activators p300 and CBP.', 'Comparative analysis of drug-like EP300/CREBBP acetyltransferase inhibitors.']"""

In a ""proof-of-concept"" study, the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting [175Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [159Tb]Tb-PSMA-617 were compared with their respective radiolabeled analogues, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (PLUVICTO, Novartis) and [161Tb]Tb-PSMA-617. ICP-MS and conventional γ-counting of the cell samples revealed almost identical results (<6% absolute difference between the two technologies) for the in vitro uptake and internalization of the (radio)metal conjugates, irrespective of the employed methodology. In vivo, an equal uptake in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor xenografts was determined 1 h after the injection of [175Lu]Lu-/[177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (41 ± 6% ID/g and 44 ± 12% IA/g, respectively) and [159Tb]Tb-/[161Tb]Tb-PSMA-617 (44 ± 5% ID/g and 44 ± 5% IA/g, respectively). It was further revealed that it is crucial to use the same ratios of the (radio)metal-labeled and unlabeled ligands for both methodologies to obtain equal data in organs in which receptor saturation was reached such as the kidneys (12 ± 2% ID/g vs 10 ± 1% IA/g, 1 h after injection). The data of this study demonstrate that the use of high-sensitivity ICP-MS allows reliable and predictive quantification of compounds labeled with stable metal isotopes in cell and tissue samples obtained in preclinical studies.

Despite the prevalence and negative impact of sexual dysfunction, sexual health clinics are the exception in cancer centers. Consequently, there is a need for effective, efficient, and inclusive sexual health programming in oncology. This paper describes the development of the innovative Sexual Health Clinic (SHC) utilizing a hybrid model of integrated in-person and virtual care. The SHC evolved from a fusion of the in-person and virtual prostate cancer clinics at Princess Margaret. This hybrid care model was adapted to include six additional cancer sites (cervical, ovarian, testicular, bladder, kidney, and head and neck). The SHC is theoretically founded in a biopsychosocial framework and emphasizes interdisciplinary intervention teams, participation by the partner, and a medical, psychological, and interpersonal approach. Virtual visits are tailored to patients based on biological sex, cancer type, and treatment type. Highly trained sexual health counselors facilitate the virtual clinic and provide an additional layer of personalization and a ""human touch"". The in-person visits complement virtual care by providing comprehensive sexual health assessment and sexual medicine prescription. The SHC is an innovative care model which has the potential to close the gap in sexual healthcare. The SHC is designed as a transferable, stand-alone clinic which can be shared with cancer centers.""","""['Andrew Matthew', 'Steven Guirguis', 'Taylor Incze', 'Elisa Stragapede', 'Sarah Peltz', 'Gideon Yang', 'Leah Jamnicky', 'Dean Elterman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['The Prostate Cancer Rehabilitation Clinic: a biopsychosocial clinic for sexual dysfunction after radical prostatectomy.', 'Sexual Recovery Following Prostate Cancer: Recommendations From 2\xa0Established Canadian Sexual Rehabilitation Clinics.', 'Core principles of sexual health treatments in cancer for men.', 'Oncosexology: Sexual Issues in the Male Cancer Survivor.', 'TrueNTH sexual recovery study protocol: a multi-institutional collaborative approach to developing and testing a web-based intervention for couples coping with the side-effects of prostate cancer treatment in a randomized controlled trial.']"""

Acceptability was assessed using study-specific questions regarding QPL satisfaction and usefulness and qualitative interviews. Feasibility was determined via the proportion of men given the QPL according to medical records and the completion of standardised measures of decisional outcomes. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive and univariate statistics. Qualitative data were thematically analysed. Fifty-two men consented; 34 provided data for analysis. The QPL recipients reported moderate-high content satisfaction (70.6%) and perceived usefulness in guiding appointments when receiving biopsy results (64.7%). Two main qualitative themes also indicated the QPL acceptability: (1) the freedom to ask-acceptable timing, flexible usage and usefulness of the QPL, and (2) satisfaction with the QPL content.

Methods:   We assessed 77 biopsy-proven PC patients who underwent 3T dual-tracer PET/mpMRI followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) between 2014 and 2017. We performed a retrospective lesion-based analysis of all cancer foci and compared it to whole-mount histopathology of the RP specimen. The primary aim was to investigate the pretherapeutic role of the imaging biomarkers FMC- and PSMA-maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) for the prediction of csPC and to compare it to the mpMRI-methods and PI-RADS score.  Results:   Overall, we identified 104 cancer foci, 69 were clinically significant (66.3%) and 35 were clinically insignificant (33.7%). We found that the combined FMC+PSMA SUVmax were the only significant parameters (p < 0.001 and p = 0.049) for the prediction of csPC. ROC analysis showed an AUC for the prediction of csPC of 0.695 for PI-RADS scoring (95% CI 0.591 to 0.786), 0.792 for FMC SUVmax (95% CI 0.696 to 0.869), 0.852 for FMC+PSMA SUVmax (95% CI 0.764 to 0.917), and 0.852 for the multivariable CHAID model (95% CI 0.763 to 0.916). Comparing the AUCs, we found that FMC+PSMA SUVmax and the multivariable model were significantly more accurate for the prediction of csPC compared to PI-RADS scoring (p = 0.0123, p = 0.0253, respectively).

Opinions on whether to dissect in the anterior or posterior surgical plane varies among researchers.  Impact of innovation:   We performed total mesorectal excision with selective en bloc resection of Denonvilliers' fascia based on preoperative MRI staging, preoperative clinical tumor stage, and tumor level in selected patients with anterior rectal tumors adherent to Denonvilliers' fascia.  Technology materials and methods:   Between March and August 2021, 5 patients who underwent robotic (n = 4) and laparoscopic (n = 1) total mesorectal excision for anteriorly located low rectal adenocarcinomas after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy were enrolled in this study. Transabdominal total mesorectal excision dissection is performed by changing to a plane anterior to Denonvilliers' fascia, with partial or total excision tailored to the tumor level and depth of invasion as a further step in circumferential resection margin clearing. Customized excision of Denonvilliers' fascia was performed by dissecting through the extramesorectal plane. This anterior plane permits resection of Denonvilliers' fascia, exposing the prostate and seminal vesicles.  Preliminary results:   Two tumors were located at the seminal vesicle level and 3 were found at the prostate level. The mean distance from the anal verge to the distal margin of the tumor was 4.8 ± 0.9 cm. Denonvilliers' fascia was preserved in 1 patient and partially excised in 4. Customized Denonvilliers' fascia excision was performed in 3 robotic ultralow anterior resections with coloanal anastomosis, 1 laparoscopic ultralow anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis, and 1 robot-assisted abdominoperineal resection. The circumferential resection margins in all patients were negative.  Conclusions and future directions:   Anterior dissection in front of Denonvilliers' fascia can be selectively performed during total mesorectal excision based on preoperative planning, tumor location, and clinical tumor stage. Preoperative MRI and magnified operative views in minimally invasive platforms provide access to more precise surgical planes for clear circumferential resection, achieving optimal functional outcomes and oncological safety.""","""['Sung Uk Bae', 'Cristopher Varela', 'Manar Nassr', 'Nam Kyu Kim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Dis Colon Rectum""","""['Reconsideration of the Anterior Surgical Plane of Total Mesorectal Excision for Rectal Cancer.', ""Denonvilliers' fascia lies anterior to the fascia propria and rectal dissection plane in total mesorectal excision."", ""Video.

However, a substantial proportion of men can experience a decline in sexual function during AS follow-up. The aim of this study was to identify predictors of declining sexual function among men on AS.  Methods:   Men enrolled from 2008 to 2018 in the South Australian Prostate Cancer Clinical Outcomes Collaborative registry-a prospective clinical registry-were studied. Sexual function outcomes were measured using expanded prostate cancer index composite (EPIC-26) at baseline and 12-months postdiagnosis. Multivariable regression models adjusted for baseline score and other sociodemographic and clinical factors were applied to identify predictors of sexual function score at 12-months.  Results:   A total of 554 men were included. Variables that showed significant association with decline in sexual function score at 12-months were: having two or more biopsies after diagnosis (mean change score (MCS): -16.3, p < 0.001) compared with no biopsy, higher number of positive biopsy cores (MCS: -1.6, p = 0.004), being in older age category (above 70 vs. below 60: MCS: -16.7, p < 0.001; 65-70 vs. below 60: MCS: -9.7, p = 0.024), having had depression (MCS: -9.0, p = 0.020), and impaired physical function (MCS: -10.0, p = 0.031). Greater socioeconomic advantage (highest vs. lowest quintile: MCS: 15.7, p = 0.022) and year of diagnosis (MCS: 2.6 for every year, p < 0.001) were positively associated with 12-months sexual function score. Neither biopsy type, biopsy timing nor PSA velocity were associated with declines in sexual function.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that multiple factors affected sexual function during AS. Interventions toward reducing the number of biopsies through less invasive monitory approaches, screening for physical and mental well-being, and targeted emotional support and counseling services may be helpful for men on AS.""","""['Tenaw Tiruye', ""Michael O'Callaghan"", 'Kerry Ettridge', 'Alex Jay', 'Kerry Santoro', 'Kim Moretti', 'Kerri Beckmann']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Association Between Radiation Therapy, Surgery, or Observation for Localized Prostate Cancer and Patient-Reported Outcomes After 3 Years.', 'Active monitoring, radical prostatectomy and radical radiotherapy in PSA-detected clinically localised prostate cancer: the ProtecT three-arm RCT.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Management of localised prostate cancer: watchful waiting, surgery or radiation therapy, depending on the natural course, which is often relatively slow.']"""

This study was conducted to investigate the role of euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2 (EHMT2) and endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERP29) in the progression of radioresistance in prostate cancer. The expression of EHMT2 and ERP29 in prostate cancer cells and during the progression of radioresistance was detected using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, and the interaction between EHMT2 and ERP29 was investigated. The proliferation of transfected cells under x-ray irradiation was determined using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and colony formation assays. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the apoptosis of the transfected cells under x-ray irradiation. Nude mice were subcutaneously injected with prostate cancer (DU145) cells stably transfected with sh-ERP29 or sh-NC. The effect of ERP29 expression on radioresistance in nude mice was assessed by x-ray irradiation. The expression of EHMT2 was upregulated and that of ERP29 was downregulated in prostate cancer cells during radioresistance progression. EHMT2 downregulation suppressed radioresistance in DU145 and androgen-sensitive prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells. In irradiated DU145 cells, EHMT2 inhibition decreased the number of colonies and accelerated apoptosis. The transcription of ERP29 was suppressed by EHMT2 by upregulating H3K9me2 and downregulating H3K4me3, thereby regulating radioresistance in prostate cancer cells. In addition, the downregulation of ERP29 promoted the progression of radioresistance in prostate cancer cells in nude mice.

We aimed to characterize the incidence and risk of bone metastases and develop a simple tool for the prediction of bone metastases among patients with PC.  Methods:   Data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 75698 patients with PC with confirmed presence or absence of bone metastases at diagnosis between 1975 and 2019 in the United States were used for analysis. Data were stratified by age, race, residence, median income, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, tumor size, distant metastatic history, and positive lymph node scores. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were performed to identify predictors of bone metastases and factors correlated with all-cause mortality. Classification tree analysis was performed to establish a model.  Results:   After patients with PC with missing data were excluded, 75698 cases remained. Among these, 3835 patients had bone metastases. Incidence proportions were highest in patients with a high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value (odds ratio (OR), 2.49; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35-4.35; p < 0.002). Multivariable Cox regression and risk analyses indicated that high PSA values (hazards ratio (HR), 19.8; 95% CI, 18.5-21.2; p < 0.001) and high positive lymph node scores (vs. score 0; HR, 8.65; 95% CI, 7.89-9.49; p < 0.001) were significant risk factors for mortality. Meanwhile, in the predication tree analysis, PSA values and lymph node scores were the most significant determining factors in two models. Median survival among the patients with PC was 78 months, but only 31 months among those with bone metastases.  Conclusion:   Patients with PC with high PSA values or high positive lymph node scores were at a significantly higher risk of bone metastases.

Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer at two institutions between 2017 and 2020. We analyzed 70 patients who were extracted by propensity score matching based on age, pre-treatment International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), and prostate volume. The patients were treated with SBRT, with a total dose of 36.25 Gy in five fractions over five consecutive weekdays, using CyberKnife or volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT).  Results:   The low-, medium-, and high-risk patients were 2, 19, and 14, respectively, in the CyberKnife group and 4, 17, and 14, respectively, in the VMAT group. The median follow-up time in both groups was 3 years. One patient with CyberKnife died of unrelated causes. No biochemical or clinical recurrence, distant metastases, or death from prostate cancer was observed. The peak values of IPSS in the acute phase (< 3 months) were significantly lower in the CyberKnife than in the VMAT group (CyberKnife:16.2 vs VMAT:20.2, p = 0.025). In multiple regression analyses, the treatment modality (p = 0.03), age (p = 0.01), bladder medication pre-irradiation (p = 0.03), and neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (p = 0.04) contributed to the peak value of the acute-phase IPSS. The incidence of treatment-related grade 2 acute GU toxicity tended to be lower in the CyberKnife than the VMAT group (CyberKnife: 22.9% vs. VMAT: 45.7%, p = 0.077). No difference was noted between the groups with regard to late IPSS or GU toxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity in all phases. Toxicities of grade ≥ 3 have not been observed to date.

This process is highly time-consuming, subjective, and relies on the extensive experience of the pathologists. Deep learning based artificial intelligence shows an ability to match pathologists on many prostate cancer diagnostic scenarios. However, it is easy to make mistakes on some hard cases with small tumor areas considering the extensively high-resolution of whole slide images (WSIs). The absence of fine-grained and large-scale annotations of such small tumor lesions makes this problem more challenging. Existing methods usually perform uniform cropping of the foreground of WSI and then use convolutional neural networks as the backbone network to predict the classification results. However, cropping can damage the structure of tiny tumors, which affects classification accuracy. To solve this problem, we propose an Intensive-Sampling Multiple Instance Learning Framework (ISMIL), which focuses on tumor regions and improves the recognition of small tumor regions by intensively sampling the crucial regions. Experiments of prostate cancer detection show that our method achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.987 on the PANDA sets, which improves recall by at least 33% with higher specificity over the current primary methods for hard cases. The ISMIL also demonstrates comparable abilities to human experts on the prostate cancer grading task. Moreover, ISMIL has shown good robustness in independent cohorts, which makes it a potential tool to improve the diagnostic efficiency of pathologists.""","""['Zhongyi Yang#', 'Xiyue Wang#', 'Jinxi Xiang#', 'Jun Zhang', 'Sen Yang', 'Xinran Wang', 'Wei Yang', 'Zhongyu Li', 'Xiao Han', 'Yueping Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Virchows Arch""","""['Combining weakly and strongly supervised learning improves strong supervision in Gleason pattern classification.', 'Automatic diagnosis and grading of Prostate Cancer with weakly supervised learning on whole slide images.', 'Semi-supervised training of deep convolutional neural networks with heterogeneous data and few local annotations: An experiment on prostate histopathology image classification.', 'Artificial Intelligence for Diagnosis and Gleason Grading of Prostate Cancer in Biopsies-Current Status and Next Steps.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, and combination treatments are the main strategies, although the feasibility of radical prostatectomy as a first-line therapy needs to be considered. This retrospective analysis of pathological results of extracted specimens evaluated long-term oncological outcomes for high-risk prostate cancer treated surgically. The association of number of risk factors with long-term outcome was specifically analyzed.  Methods:   We identified patients with high-risk prostate cancer who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy, without neoadjuvant therapy, at Nippon Medical School from 2000 to 2012. Risk factors were a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration ≥20 ng/mL, pathological ≥T3, and pathological Gleason Score ≥8. Biological failure was defined as a PSA concentration ≥0.2 ng/mL.  Results:   222 men were identified. One patient had a positive lymph node status, and there was a significant difference in surgical margin positivity (52 men, 68.4% vs 56 men 38.4%) between patients with and without biochemical failure. Among patients meeting the high-risk criteria with a follow-up of up to 133 months, the biochemical recurrence (BCR) -free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 62.8% and 58.4%, respectively, and mean time to BCR was 14.0 months. BCR-free survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 73.6% and 71.4%, respectively, for 1 risk factor, 48.7% and 34.6% for 2 factors, and 34.5% and 34.5% for 3 factors. Patients with a single risk factor had a significantly better outcome than those with multiple risk factors. The overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 94.6% and 93.7%, and the cancer-specific survival rate was 100% at both 5 and 10 years.

Objective:   The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a 6-mo online home-based physical, mental, and social support intervention, the Prostate Cancer Patient Empowerment Program (PC-PEP), on preventing psychological distress among men undergoing curative prostate cancer treatment.  Design, setting, and participants:   In a crossover randomized clinical trial of 128 men aged 50-82 yr scheduled for curative prostate cancer surgery or radiotherapy (± hormone treatment), 66 received the 6-mo PC-PEP intervention and 62 were randomized to a waitlist-control arm and received the standard of care for 6 mo, and then PC-PEP to the end of the year. The PC-PEP intervention consisted of daily e-mails with video instructions providing education, patient activation, and empowerment on healthy living including physical and mental health, dietary recommendations, social support, physical and pelvic floor fitness, stress reduction using a biofeedback device, social connection and intimacy, and social support.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was nonspecific psychological distress (clinical cutoff ≥20) measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12 mo using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10).  Results and limitations:   At 6 mo, patients in the waitlist-control group had 3.59 (95% confidence interval: 1.12-11.51) times higher odds for nonspecific psychological distress and need for psychological treatment than men who received the PC-PEP intervention. At 12 mo, the wait-list control group that received the intervention at 6 mo had higher psychological distress than the early group.  Conclusions:   PC-PEP delivered early following diagnosis significantly prevented the burden of psychological distress in men undergoing curative prostate cancer treatment compared with standard of care, or late (6 mo later) intervention.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the effectiveness of a program (Prostate Cancer Patient Empowerment Program: PC-PEP) developed with patients' engagement on the mental distress of patients awaiting curative treatment for their prostate cancer. The PC-PEP program lasted for 6 mo, and it prescribed, described, and demonstrated daily aerobic and strength training, kegels (pelvic floor training to help with urinary and sexual function), dietary changes that have been shown to be helpful in the prevention of prostate cancer and prostate cancer progression, stress reduction using a biofeedback device, as well as social and emotional support. All patients in the PC-PEP program were invited to a monthly video conference with the leads of the program who appeared in the 6 mo of daily videos prescribing the activities the patients were asked to watch and follow. The leads were a prostate cancer oncologist and a scientist in prostate cancer quality of life research. Half of the patients in this study received PC-PEP daily for the first 6 mo and were re-assessed at the end of the year. The other half received standard of care for 6 month and then received the intervention to the end of the year. The results of the study show that, at 6 mo, this intervention was effective at reducing the mental distress that accompanies a prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment compared with the standard of care. Mental distress was significantly reduced when the intervention was received early, compared with that received late (6 mo after scheduled curative treatment). We conclude that multi-faceted patient education and empowerment programming of this kind that is developed with patient engagement from the start is crucial to the care of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer and should be implemented in the standard of care. While treatment for prostate cancer is highly successful, side effects that accompany most treatments significantly affect the quality of life of patients. Here, we describe PC-PEP, a patient education and activation program that is cost effective, highly enforced by patients, and successful at reducing the impact of prostate cancer active treatment-related side effects on their psychological state.

Cabazitaxel is approved in the post-docetaxel treatment setting. However, recent studies suggested cross-resistance between the development of drug resistance and current treatments. In this study, we used docetaxel-resistant cell lines DU145/DTX50 and PC-3/DTX30 to measure the responses to cabazitaxel. Our findings demonstrated that docetaxel resistance could lead to cross-resistance to cabazitaxel. After docetaxel-resistant cells were treated with cabazitaxel, transcriptome analysis was performed, and the results were analyzed in combination with survival analysis and correlation analysis with Gleason score to screen the cross-resistance genes. The continuously increased expression of kinesin family member 14 (KIF14) was identified as the main cause of cross-resistance to cabazitaxel in docetaxel-resistant cells. Silencing the expression of KIF14 could restore the sensitivity of resistant PCa cells to docetaxel and cabazitaxel, attenuate proliferation and promote apoptosis of the resistant PCa cells. Notably, the depressed expression of KIF14 inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt located downstream. In summary, KIF14 mediates the cross-resistance between docetaxel and cabazitaxel, and targeting KIF14 could be an effective measurement for reversing docetaxel or cabazitaxel chemotherapy failure or enhancing the anti-tumor effects of docetaxel or cabazitaxel.""","""['Lina Liu', 'Mengyuan Li', 'Junshuo Zhang', 'Dengfei Xu', 'Yan Guo', 'Hui Zhang', 'Shundong Cang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Arch Biochem Biophys""","""['Molecular Mechanism Mediating Cytotoxic Activity of Cabazitaxel in Docetaxel-resistant Human Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'The CCL2-CCR2 Axis Contributes to Migration of Cabazitaxel-resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.', 'Targeting the Androgen Receptor Confers In Vivo Cross-resistance Between Enzalutamide and Docetaxel, But Not Cabazitaxel, in Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Practical guide to the use of chemotherapy in castration resistant prostate cancer.']"""

We included 3071 trial participants for model development using a mixed-effect submodel for the longitudinal PSAs and a time-to-event hazard submodel for predicting recurrence of prostate cancer. We evaluated how baseline prognostic factor subgroups affected the nonlinear PSA levels over time and quantified the association of PSA on time to recurrence. We assessed bootstrapped optimism-adjusted predictive performance on calibration and discrimination. Additionally, we performed comparative dynamic predictions on patients with contrasting prognostic factors and investigated PSA thresholds over landmark times to correlate with prognosis.  Results:   Patients who developed recurrence had generally higher baseline and overall PSA values during follow-up and had an exponentially rising PSA in the 2 years before recurrence. Additionally, most baseline risk factors were significant in the mixed-effect and relative-risk submodels. PSA value and rate of change were predictive of recurrence. Predictive performance of the model was good across different prediction times over an 8-year period, with an overall mean area under the curve of 0.70, mean Brier score of 0.10, and mean integrated calibration index of 0.048; these were further improved for predictions after 5 years of accrued longitudinal posttreatment PSA assessments. PSA thresholds <0.23 ng/mL after 3 years were indicative of a minimal risk of recurrence by 8 years.  Conclusions:   We successfully developed a joint statistical model to predict prostate cancer recurrence, evaluating prognostic factors and longitudinal PSA. We showed dynamically updated PSA information can improve prognostication, which can be used to guide follow-up and treatment management options.""","""['Harry Parr', 'Nuria Porta', 'Alison C Tree', 'David Dearnaley', 'Emma Hall']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys""","""['Comparison of Joint and Landmark Modeling for Predicting Cancer Progression in Men With Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Secondary Post Hoc Analysis of the PREVAIL Randomized Clinical Trial.', 'Nonlinear joint models for individual dynamic prediction of risk of death using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: application to metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Development and validation of a dynamic prognostic tool for prostate cancer recurrence using repeated measures of posttreatment PSA: a joint modeling approach.', 'Joint models for dynamic prediction in localised prostate cancer: a literature review.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

To mitigate risk of toxicity, target coverage was sacrificed to prioritize organs-at-risk (OARs) during SABR planning in the population-based SABR-5 trial. This study evaluated the effect of this practice on dosimetry, local recurrence (LR), and progression-free survival (PFS).  Methods:   This single-arm phase II trial included patients with up to 5 oligometastases between November 2016 and July 2020. Theprotocol-specified planning objective was to cover 95 % of the planning target volume (PTV) with 100 % of the prescribed dose, however PTV coverage was reduced as needed to meet OAR constraints. This trade-off was measured using the coverage compromise index (CCI), computed as minimum dose received by the hottest 99 % of the PTV (D99) divided by the prescription dose. Under-coverage was defined as CCI < 0.90. The potential association between CCI and outcomes was evaluated.  Results:   549 lesions from 381 patients were assessed. Mean CCI was 0.88 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.86-0.89), and 196 (36 %) lesions were under-covered. The highest mean CCI (0.95; 95 %CI, 0.93-0.97) was in non-spine bone lesions (n = 116), while the lowest mean CCI (0.71; 95 % CI, 0.69-0.73) was in spine lesions (n = 104). On multivariable analysis, under-coverage did not predict for worse LR (HR 0.48, p = 0.37) or PFS (HR 1.24, p = 0.38). Largest lesion diameter, colorectal and 'other' (non-prostate, breast, or lung) primary predicted for worse LR. Largest lesion diameter, synchronous tumor treatment, short disease free interval, state of oligoprogression, initiation or change in systemic treatment, and a high PTV Dmax were significantly associated with PFS.  Conclusion:   PTV under-coverage was not associated with worse LR or PFS in this large, population-based phase II trial.

Dietary zinc deficiency results in stunted growth, skin lesions, hypogonadism and frequent infections in humans. Mice genetically lacking Slc30a7 suffer from mild zinc deficiency and are prone to development of prostate cancer and insulin resistance. Disease-causing variants or mutations in the human SLC30A7 (ZNT7) gene have not been previously reported. Here, we describe two-boy siblings from a French family with stunted growth, testicular hypoplasia and bone marrow failure. Exome sequencing revealed compound heterozygous variants in ZNT7 consisting of NM_133496.5:c.21dup; p.Asp8ArgfsTer3 and c.842 + 15 T > C inherited from their unaffected mother and father, respectively. The c.21dup variant led to a premature stop codon generated in exon 1 of the ZNT7 coding sequence. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated that the c.842 + 15 T > C variant resulted in a leaky mRNA splicing event generating a premature stop codon right after the splicing donor site of exon 8. Moreover, the expression of ZNT7 protein was remarkably reduced by 80-96% in the affected brothers compared to the control cells.

Furthermore, the mechanisms regulating PSMA expression (encoded by the FOLH1 gene) are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that PSMA expression is heterogeneous across different metastatic sites and molecular subtypes of mCRPC. In a rapid autopsy cohort in which multiple metastatic sites per patient were sampled, we found that 13 of 52 (25%) cases had no detectable PSMA and 23 of 52 (44%) cases showed heterogeneous PSMA expression across individual metastases, with 33 (63%) cases harboring at least 1 PSMA-negative site. PSMA-negative tumors displayed distinct transcriptional profiles with expression of druggable targets such as MUC1. Loss of PSMA was associated with epigenetic changes of the FOLH1 locus, including gain of CpG methylation and loss of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation. Treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors reversed this epigenetic repression and restored PSMA expression in vitro and in vivo.

Radical prostatectomy (RP) is an option for selected high-risk PCa cases, especially in younger, healthier patients. However, a high Gleason score and high T stage can increase the risk of RP. Neoadjuvant therapy has been reported in high- or very-high-risk PCa, but its clinical use remains controversial.  Diagnoses and patient concerns:   A 53-year-old male patient diagnosed with PCa was referred to our hospital. The patient's Gleason score was 4 + 5, and the clinical stage was T4N0M0, with an abnormally enlarged prostate adhering to the rectum and leading to decreased mobility of the rectum, suggesting a very-high-risk PCa inappropriate for RP. However, instead of external beam radiation therapy, which is the standard treatment for inoperable PCa, the patient insisted on RP.  Interventions:   Androgen deprivation therapy plus docetaxel was chosen as the first downstaging treatment; however, the tumor was too slightly downsized to undergo RP. Therefore, zimberelimab was added after confirmation of a genomic feature of high microsatellite instability and high tumor mutational burden status.  Outcomes:   After 4 doses of zimberelimab, the prostate shrank significantly. The patient successfully completed RP after another dose of zimberelimab, and achieved a pathological complete response (pCR).

Here, we presented a random-effect model-based cross-cancer meta-analysis framework for identifying the genetic variants jointly influencing the five solid cancers. A comprehensive genetic correlation analysis (genome-wide, partitioned, and local) approach was performed by using GWAS summary statistics of the five cancers, and we observed three cancer pairs with significant genetic correlation: breast-ovarian cancer (r g = 0.221, p = 0.0003), breast-lung cancer (r g = 0.234, p = 7.6 × 10-6), and lung-head/neck cancer (r g = 0.652, p = 0.010). Furthermore, a random-effect model-based cross-trait meta-analysis was conducted for each significant cancer pair, and we found 27 shared genetic loci between breast and ovarian cancers, 18 loci between breast and lung cancers, and three loci between lung and head/neck cancers.

Whereas the classical/conventional PKCα isozyme has been linked to tumor suppression in most cancer types, here we demonstrate that this kinase is required for the mitogenic activity of aggressive human prostate cancer cells displaying aberrantly high PKCα expression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed abnormal up-regulation of PKCα in human primary prostate tumors. Interestingly, silencing PKCα expression from aggressive prostate cancer cells impairs cell cycle progression, proliferation and invasion, as well as their tumorigenic activity in a mouse xenograft model. Mechanistic analysis revealed that PKCα exerts a profound control of gene expression, particularly over genes and transcriptional networks associated with cell cycle progression and E2F transcription factors. PKCα RNAi depletion from PC3 prostate cancer cells led to a reduction in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, as well as a prominent down-regulation of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1. This PKCα-dependent gene expression profile was corroborated in silico using human prostate cancer databases. Our studies established PKCα as a multifunctional kinase that plays pleiotropic roles in prostate cancer, particularly by controlling genetic networks associated with tumor growth and progression.

Among the synthesized compounds, the C-17 p-methoxy phenyl ester analog 8s inhibited cell proliferation effectively in A549 (IC50: 6.6 μM) and PC-3 (IC50: 5.9 μM) cell variants, and compound 9s exhibited the most potent activity against the A594 cell line, with an IC50 value of 3.5 μM. Further anticancer mechanistic investigation demonstrated that compound 9s displayed nuclear morphological changes and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) with disturbed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) that can lead to apoptosis.

Expression of NPEPL1 has been reported to be involved in prostate, breast, and colorectal cancers. However, the role and mechanism of NPEPL1 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are unclear. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Human Protein Atlas (HPA) databases were used to predict the relationship between clinicopathological features and NPEPL1 expression. Changes in immune status and drug sensitivity with NPEPL1 expression were analyzed by the ""CIBERSORT"" function in R software. The results found that NPEPL1 expression was upregulated in ccRCC tissues, with expression progressively increasing with ccRCC stage and grade. Patients with high NPEPL1 expression presented with a poor prognosis across different clinicopathological features. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that aberrant NPEPL1 expression was an independent risk factor for ccRCC. The nomogram showed that NPEPL1 expression improved the accuracy of predicting the prognosis of ccRCC patients. The Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that NPEPL1 may be involved in the development of ccRCC through the voltage-gated calcium channel complex, channel activity, cAMP signaling pathway, and oxytocin signaling pathway. The coexpression analysis found that NPEPL1 altered tumor characteristics by interacting with related genes. The ""CIBERSORT"" analysis showed that elevated NPEPL1 expression was followed by an enrichment of regulatory T cells and follicular helper T cells in the microenvironment. The drug sensitivity analysis found patients with high NPEPL1 expression had a higher benefit from axitinib, cisplatin, and GSK429286A. In conclusion, upregulation of NPEPL1 expression was involved in ccRCC prognosis and treatment.

A systematic immunological analysis of TP53 somatic mutation classification in multiple cancers is still lacking.  Methods:   To assess the immunological value of TP53 somatic mutation classification in various cancers, we integrated a series of bioinformatics methods to analyze the role of TP53 gene across the public databases, such as UCSC Xena, Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), Ensembl, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx).  Results:   The results revealed that the TP53 expression level had significant difference in tumor tissues and normal tissues, and it had a high expression level in most malignant tumors. Moreover, the missense mutation is the most common type of TP53 mutation in most cancers. In addition, the Cox proportional hazards model analysis and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis demonstrated that the TP53 expression is a high-risk factor in brain lower-grade glioma (LGG), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and uterine carcinosarcoma (UCS), which is opposite in uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC). Besides, compared to the TP53 nontruncating mutation classification samples, we found that TP53 truncating mutation samples had lower TP53 expression levels in certain types of cancer. Notably, TP53 was associated with the mismatch repair (MMR) gene in some cancers which contained truncating or nontruncating mutation. Based on the classification of truncating or nontruncating mutation, we also discovered that TP53 expression was positively or negatively correlated with the immune score, stromal score, and the levels of immune cell infiltration in different cancers.  Conclusions:   Our research reveals an overarching landscape of immunological value on TP53 status in various malignant tumors.

Although the functions of miR-141-3p and AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5) were identified in some cancers, whether they were involved in the development of PCa remains unclear. In this study, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction unveiled that the expression of ALKBH5 was reduced in PCa tissues and was negatively correlated with miR-141-3p. ALKBH5 attenuated the malignant development of PCa through suppressing the growth, migration, invasion, and sphere formation abilities of PCa cells. In addition, the luciferase activity assay identified that ALKBH5 was corroborated as a downstream target of miR-141-3p. Moreover, miR-141-3p expression was boosted in PCa tissues and cells and inhibition of miR-141-3p suppressed the tumor growth of PCa in vivo. Moreover, ALKBH5 was confirmed to suppress protein arginine methyltransferase 6 (PRMT6) expression through N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification. We further identified that miR-141-3p-modulated PRMT6 level through mediating ALKBH5. Furthermore, PRMT6 level was positively correlated with miR-141-3p level and negatively associated with ALKBH5 level. Finally, rescue assays also uncovered that miR-141-3p aggravated PCa development by regulating PRMT6. In conclusion, miR-141-3p accelerated the malignant progression of PCa through ALKBH5-mediated m6A modification of PRMT6, which might offer a novel insight into the role of miR-141-3p and ALKBH5 in the treatments of PCa patients.""","""['Xun Li', 'Bide Liu', 'Shuheng Wang', 'Jiuzhi Li', 'Xiaohu Ge']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Chin J Physiol""","""['The N6-methyladenosine demethylase ALKBH5 negatively regulates the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells through PRMT6.', 'A positive feedback loop between AlkB homolog 5 and miR-193a-3p promotes growth and metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.', 'ALKBH5 promotes the progression of infantile hemangioma through regulating the NEAT1/miR-378b/FOSL1 axis.', 'ALKBH5 promotes lung fibroblast activation and silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis through miR-320a-3p and FOXM1.', 'RNA demethylase ALKBH5 in cancer: from mechanisms to therapeutic potential.']"""

However, focusing on specific glycans or glycoproteins may lose much data relevant to glycosylation alterations. The present study aimed to first comprehensively investigate the expression and mutation profiles of glycosylation-related genes (GRgenes) in prostate cancer (PCa) and then develop a glycosylation signature and explore its role in predicting the progression and immunotherapeutic response of PCa.  Methods:   Based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we comprehensively screened potential prognostic GRgenes and analyzed their expression and mutation profiles in PCa. Through consensus clustering analysis, the study cohort was classified to investigate the effect of glycosylation patterns on the prognosis of PCa. Next, we developed a glycosylation signature (i.e., the glycosylation score [Gly_score]) using the differentially expressed genes between glycosylation pattern groups and evaluated its role in predicting the progression and immunotherapeutic response of PCa.  Results:   We identified two distinct glycosylation patterns in PCa and found that GRgene expression patterns rather than mutations are associated with the prognosis of PCa. The high Gly_score group had significantly shorter progression-free survival, lower PD-L1 levels, less infiltration of immune cells and lower immunophenoscores than the low Gly_score group. When the patients were grouped according to both the Gly_score and PD-L1 level, patients with a combination of low Gly_score and low PD-L1 expression had the best survival outcomes.

Materials and methods:   The study population consisted of 68 patients (34 with SVI, 34 without SVI, matching groups by age and prostate volume) who underwent PIRADS V2.1-compliant multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; 34 at 1.5 T, 34 at 3 T). Before the examination, the time of last ejaculation (38/68 ≤ 5 days, 30/68 > 5 days) was collected via a questionnaire. The five PIRADS V2.1 criteria for SVI with subsequent overall assessment were evaluated retrospectively by two independent examiners (examiner 1 with >10 years of experience, examiner 2 with 6 months of experience) in a single-blinded fashion for all patients using a questionnaire and a six-point scale (0 = no, 1 = very likely not, 2 = probably not, 3 = possible, 4 = probable, 5 = certain).  Results:   E1 achieved high specificity (100%) and positive predictive value (PPV; 100%) in the overall assessment, independent of the time of last ejaculation (sensitivity = 76.5%, negative predictive value [NPV] = 81%). The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.882; for E2, it was 0.765. At ≤5 days, the AUC values of E1 and E2 differed significantly (0.867 versus 0.681, p=0.016), as did the diffusion restriction criterion (0.833 versus 0.681, p=0.028). E1 showed high AUC values independent of time. E2 had better values for all criteria at >5 days than at ≤5 days. There were no significant differences between the examiners in all observations at >5 days.  Conclusion:   The PIRADS V2.1 criteria are well suited for an experienced examiner to detect SVI independent of time point. An inexperienced examiner will benefit from patients being abstinent >5 days prior to MRI.""","""['F Blasi', 'A Malouhi', 'C-H Cho', 'D Nißler', 'F P Berger', 'M-O Grimm', 'M Abubrig', 'U Teichgräber', 'T Franiel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Radiol""","""['Seminal vesicle invasion on multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging: Correlation with histopathology.', 'Diagnostic Accuracy of Multiparametric MRI versus 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI for Extracapsular Extension and Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Patients with Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparison of biparametric versus multiparametric prostate MRI for the detection of extracapsular extension and seminal vesicle invasion in biopsy naïve patients.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Seminal vesicle biopsies: an useful staging procedure-exposure of seminal vesicle biopsies protocol and review of the literature.']"""

The dimers were synthesized using a short five-step reaction sequence with 28% and 38% overall yield for the testosterone and dihydrotestosterone dimer, respectively. The dimerization reaction was achieved by an olefin metathesis reaction with 2nd generation Hoveyda-Grubbs catalyst. The dimers and their corresponding 17α-allyl precursors were tested for the antiproliferative activity on androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and androgen-independent (PC3) prostate cancer cell lines. The effects on cells were compared with that of the antiandrogen cyproterone acetate (CPA). The results showed that the dimers were active on both cell lines, with an increased activity towards androgen-dependent LNCaP cells. However, the testosterone dimer (11) was fivefold more active than the dihydrotestosterone dimer (15), with an IC50 of 11.7 μM vs. 60.9 μM against LNCaP cells, respectively, and more than threefold more active than the reference drug CPA (IC50 of 40.7 μM). Likewise, studies on the interaction of new compounds with drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) showed that 11 was a fourfold stronger inhibitor than 15 (IC50 of 3 μM and 12 μM, respectively).

Investigating PIM-1 kinase inhibitory activity of compound 10f revealed an IC50 of 17 nM paralleled to that of Staurosporine (IC50 = 16.7 nM). Furthermore, compound 10f displayed an antioxidant activity eliciting a DPPH inhibition ratio of 94% as compared to Trolox (96%). Further investigation demonstrated that 10f induced apoptosis in treated PC-3 cells by 43.2-fold (19.44%) compared to 0.45% in control. 10f also disrupted the PC-3 cell cycle by increasing the cell population at the PreG1-phase by 19.29-fold while decreasing the G2/M-phase by 0.56-fold compared to control. Moreover, 10f affected a downregulation of JAK2, STAT3 and Bcl-2 and upregulation of caspases 3, 8 and 9 levels that activated the caspase-dependent apoptosis. Finally, in vivo 10f-treatment caused a significant increase in tumor inhibition by 64.2% compared to 44.5% in Staurosporine treatment of the PC-3 xenograft mouse model. Additionally, it improved the hematological, biochemical parameters, and histopathological examinations compared to control untreated animals. Finally, docking of 10f with the ATP-binding site of PIM-1 kinase demonstrated good recognition of and effective binding to the active site.

Materials and methods:   We reviewed records from 1970-2018 to identify patients with genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder, prostate, pelvis, vagina, and uterus. We assessed modes of therapy, and if surgical, the type of resection, reconstruction, and reoperation. Primary outcomes included urinary continence, urinary tract infection occurrence, and stone formation. We also surveyed patients older than 18 years for urinary and sexual function.  Results:   Fifty-one patients were identified for the post-treatment outcomes cohort. All received chemotherapy, 46 (90.2%) underwent surgery, and 34 (67%) received radiation. Twenty-nine patients (56.9%) received trimodal therapy, 17 (33.3%) received chemotherapy/surgery, and 5 (9.8%) received chemotherapy/radiation. Twenty-six had up-front radical surgery (with staged continence mechanism creation); these patients had higher rates of continence, similar rates of urinary tract infection, and higher rates of stone formation compared to those who were organ-spared. A third (4/12) of organ-spared patients underwent additional corrective surgery. Thirty patients with genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma were surveyed and 14 responded to questionnaires. Overall, urinary complaints were mild, but both male and female respondents reported significant sexual dysfunction.

These missed detections result in a higher positive surgical margin rate (P < 0.05). In patients with TZ lesions, detected MP-MRI ECE may have grey areas: the longest diameters of the MRI lesions were 16.5-23.5 mm; MRI lesion volumes were 0.63-2.51 ml; MRI lesion volume ratios were 2.75-8.86%; PSA were 13.85-23.05 ng/ml. LASSO regression was used to construct a clinical prediction model for predicting the risk of ECE in TZ lesions from the perspective of MRI and clinical features, including four variables: the longest diameter of MRI lesions, TZ pseudocapsule invasion, ISUP grading of biopsy pathology, and number of positive biopsy needles.  Conclusions:   Patients with MRI lesions in the TZ have the same incidence of ECE as those with lesions in the PZ, but a higher missed detection rate.""","""['Xin Chen#', 'Wei Li#', 'Jiajian Yang', 'Chen Huang', 'Chenchao Zhou', 'Yongchang Chen', 'Yuxin Lin', 'Jianquan Hou#', 'Yuhua Huang#', 'Xuedong Wei#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness and Accuracy of MRI-Ultrasound Fusion Targeted Biopsy Based on PI-RADS v2.1 Category in Transition/Peripheral Zone of the Prostate.', 'The Key Combined Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging-targeted and Concomitant Systematic Biopsies for the Prediction of Adverse Pathological Features in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Prevalence of Prostate Cancer in PI-RADS Version 2.1 Transition Zone Atypical Nodules Upgraded by Abnormal DWI: Correlation With MRI-Directed TRUS-Guided Targeted Biopsy.', 'Comparison of Real-Time Virtual Sonography Navigation Versus BioJet Navigation on Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Prostate Needle Biopsy: A Single Institutional Analysis.']"""

Subjects and methods:   This population-based analysis compared a cohort of all men with initial non-malignant TRUS biopsy in Denmark between 1995 and 2016 (N = 37 231) with the Danish population matched by age and calendar year, obtained from the NORDCAN 9.1 database. Age- and calendar year-corrected standardized prostate cancer incidence (SIR) and prostate cancer-specific mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated and heterogeneity among age groups was assessed with the Cochran's Q test.  Results:   The median time to censoring was 11 years, and 4434 men were followed for more than 15 years. The corrected SIR was 5.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.1-5.4) and the corrected SMR was 0.74 (95% CI 0.67-0.81). Estimates differed among age groups (P < 0.001 for both), with a higher SIR and SMR among younger men.  Conclusion:   Men with non-malignant TRUS biopsy have a much higher incidence of prostate cancer but a risk of prostate cancer death below the population average. This underlines that the oncological risk of cancers missed in the initial TRUS biopsy is low. Accordingly, attempts to increase the sensitivity of initial biopsy are unjustified. Moreover, current follow-up after non-malignant biopsy is likely to be overaggressive, particularly in men over the age of 60 years.""","""['Hein V Stroomberg', 'Marc C M Andersen', 'John Thomas Helgstrand', 'Signe Benzon Larsen', 'Andrew J Vickers', 'Klaus Brasso', 'Andreas Røder']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BJU Int""","""['Risk of prostate cancer diagnosis and mortality in men with a benign initial transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy set: a population-based study.', 'Italian cancer figures, report 2013: Multiple tumours.', 'Detection of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer by Systematic TRUS-Biopsies in a Population-Based Setting Over a 20 Year Period.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

Transrectal ultrasound (US) imaging is typically used for guiding needle insertion, including localization of the needle tip which is critical for treatment planning. However, image artifacts can limit needle tip visibility in standard brightness (B)-mode US, potentially leading to dose delivery that deviates from the planned dose. To improve intraoperative tip visualization in visually obstructed needles, we propose a power Doppler (PD) US method which utilizes a novel wireless mechanical oscillator, validated in phantom experiments and clinical HDR-BT cases as part of a feasibility clinical trial.  Methods:   Our wireless oscillator contains a DC motor housed in a 3D printed case and is powered by rechargeable battery allowing the device to be operated by one person with no additional equipment required in the operating room. The oscillator end-piece features a cylindrical shape designed for BT applications to fit on top of the commonly used cylindrical needle mandrins. Phantom validation was completed using tissue-equivalent agar phantoms with the clinical US system and both plastic and metal needles. Our PD method was tested using a needle implant pattern matching a standard HDR-BT procedure as well as an implant pattern designed to maximize needle shadowing artifacts. Needle tip localization accuracy was assessed using the clinical method based on ideal reference needles as well as a comparison to computed tomography (CT) as a gold standard. Clinical validation was completed in five patients who underwent standard HDR-BT as part of a feasibility clinical trial. Needle tips positions were identified using B-mode US and PD US with perturbation from our wireless oscillator.  Results:   Absolute mean ± standard deviation tip error for B-mode alone, PD alone, and B-mode combined with PD was respectively: 0.3 ± 0.3 mm, 0.6 ± 0.5 mm, and 0.4 ± 0.2 mm for the mock HDR-BT needle implant; 0.8 ± 1.7 mm, 0.4 ± 0.6 mm, and 0.3 ± 0.5 mm for the explicit shadowing implant with plastic needles; and 0.5 ± 0.2 mm, 0.5 ± 0.3 mm, and 0.6 ± 0.2 mm for the explicit shadowing implant with metal needles. The total mean absolute tip error for all five patients in the feasibility clinical trial was 0.9 ± 0.7 mm using B-mode US alone and 0.8 ± 0.5 mm when including PD US, with increased benefit observed for needles classified as visually obstructed.  Conclusions:   Our proposed PD needle tip localization method is easy to implement and requires no modifications or additions to the standard clinical equipment or workflow. We have demonstrated decreased tip localization error and variation for visually obstructed needles in both phantom and clinical cases, including providing the ability to visualize needles previously not visible using B-mode US alone. This method has the potential to improve needle visualization in challenging cases without burdening the clinical workflow, potentially improving treatment accuracy in HDR-BT and more broadly in any minimally invasive needle-based procedure.""","""['Nathan Orlando', 'Jonatan Snir', 'Kevin Barker', ""David D'Souza"", 'Vikram Velker', 'Lucas C Mendez', 'Aaron Fenster', 'Douglas A Hoover']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Simultaneous automatic segmentation of multiple needles using 3D ultrasound for high-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Toward a 3D transrectal ultrasound system for verification of needle placement during high-dose-rate interstitial gynecologic brachytherapy.', 'Multi-needle Localization with Attention U-Net in US-guided HDR Prostate Brachytherapy.', 'Use of three-dimensional radiation therapy planning tools and intraoperative ultrasound to evaluate high dose rate prostate brachytherapy implants.', 'High dose rate brachytherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer.']"""

AKR1C3 is a target for treatment of breast and prostate cancer and AKR1C3 inhibition could be an effective adjuvant therapy in the context of leukemia and other cancers. In the present study, steroidal bile acid fused tetrazoles were screened for their ability to inhibit AKR1C3. Four C24 bile acids with C-ring fused tetrazoles were moderate to strong AKR1C3 inhibitors (37-88% inhibition), while B-ring fused tetrazoles had no effect on AKR1C3 activity. Based on a fluorescence assay in yeast cells, these four compounds displayed no affinity for estrogen receptor-α, or the androgen receptor, suggesting a lack of estrogenic or androgenic effects. A top inhibitor showed specificity for AKR1C3 over AKR1C2, and inhibited AKR1C3 with an IC50 of ∼7 μM. The structure of AKR1C3·NADP+ in complex with this C-ring fused bile acid tetrazole was determined by X-ray crystallography at 1.4 Å resolution, revealing that the C24 carboxylate is anchored to the catalytic oxyanion site (H117, Y55); meanwhile the tetrazole interacts with a tryptophan (W227) important for steroid recognition.

Recently, the introduction of genomic profiling and the use of new techniques like next-generation sequencing (NGS) in many cancers provide novel tools for the discovery of new molecular targets that might improve our understanding of the genomic aberrations in PCa and the discovery of novel prognostic and therapeutic targets. In this study, we investigated the possible mechanisms through which Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) produces its possible protective role in PCa using NGS in both the DKK3 overexpression PCa cell line (PC3) model and our patient cohort consisting of nine PCa and five benign prostatic hyperplasia. Interestingly, our results have shown that DKK3 transfection-modulated genes are involved in the regulation of cell motility, senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and cytokine signaling in the immune system, as well as in the regulation of adaptive immune response. Further analysis of our NGS using our in vitro model revealed the presence of 36 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DKK3 transfected cells and PC3 empty vector. In addition, both CP and ACE2 genes were differentially expressed not only between the transfected and empty groups but also between the transfected and Mock cells. The top common DEGs between the DKK3 overexpression cell line and our patient cohort are the following: IL32, IRAK1, RIOK1, HIST1H2BB, SNORA31, AKR1B1, ACE2, and CP. The upregulated genes including IL32, HIST1H2BB, and SNORA31 showed tumor suppressor functions in various cancers including PCa. On the other hand, both IRAK1 and RIOK1 were downregulated and involved in tumor initiation, tumor progression, poor outcome, and radiotherapy resistance.

There have been numerous studies to develop antagonists against androgen receptor (AR), a crucial therapeutic target for PCa. This study is a systematic cheminformatic analysis and machine learning modeling to study the chemical space, scaffolds, structure-activity relationship, and landscape of human AR antagonists. There are 1678 molecules as final data sets. Chemical space visualization by physicochemical property visualization has demonstrated that molecules from the potent/active class generally have a mildly smaller molecular weight (MW), octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), number of hydrogen-bond acceptors (nHA), number of rotatable bonds (nRot), and topological polar surface area (TPSA) than molecules from intermediate/inactive class. The chemical space visualization in the principal component analysis (PCA) plot shows significant overlapping distributions between potent/active class molecules and intermediate/inactive class molecules; potent/active class molecules are intensively distributed, while intermediate/inactive class molecules are widely and sparsely distributed. Murcko scaffold analysis has shown low scaffold diversity in general, and scaffold diversity of potent/active class molecules is even lower than intermediate/inactive class molecules, indicating the necessity for developing molecules with novel scaffolds. Furthermore, scaffold visualization has identified 16 representative Murcko scaffolds. Among them, scaffolds 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, and 16 are highly favorable scaffolds due to their high scaffold enrichment factor values. Based on scaffold analysis, their local structure-activity relationships (SARs) were investigated and summarized. In addition, the global SAR landscape was explored by quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modelings and structure-activity landscape visualization. A QSAR classification model incorporating all of the 1678 molecules stands out as the best model from a total of 12 candidate models for AR antagonists (built on PubChem fingerprint, extra trees algorithm, accuracy for training set: 0.935, 10-fold cross-validation set: 0.735 and test set: 0.756). Deeper insights into the structure-activity landscape highlighted a total of seven significant activity cliff (AC) generators (ChEMBL molecule IDs: 160257, 418198, 4082265, 348918, 390728, 4080698, and 6530), which provide valuable SAR information for medicinal chemistry.

The development of one-step dipstick-type detection assays of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) offers an approach to prostate cancer detection, treatment and monitoring that circumvents issues related to laboratory quality control and is also low-cost. Curative-intent treatments of early-stage prostate cancer are often unavailable in low-resource contexts, and most prostate cancers are not detected in Africa until they are at an advanced stage. Hence, androgen deprivation treatments, including orchiectomy and older low-cost drugs, offer feasible and affordable approaches to prolong survival and sustain a reasonable quality of life.

No statistical difference was noted in tPSA decline rates (declined tPSA value per day) in RARP+ADT and ADT group (8.1 ± 4.7 verse 7.5 ± 8.0 ng/ml/d, p = 0.853). However, tPSA percentage decline rate (declined tPSA percentage per day) was significantly higher in RARP+ADT group (11.6 ± 1.5%/d verses 2.9 ± 2.2%/d, p< 0.001). Immediate urinary continence was achieved in 9 patients (90%) upon removal of urethral catheter on post-operative day 7 in RARP+ADT group.  Conclusion:   ADT alone and in combination with RARP both provide effective tumor control in patients suffering from prostate cancer with oligometastasis.

This study evaluated the association of PSADT with clinical and economic outcomes in a real-world setting among patients with nmCRPC not receiving novel hormonal therapy (NHT), using 2-month PSADT thresholds.  Patients and methods:   We retrospectively identified Veterans Health Administration patients with nonmetastatic prostate cancer and ≥2 PSA increases after medical/surgical castration (2012-2016). The third measurement was the index (CRPC) date. Patients with ≥3 postindex PSA measurements, including index, were followed until death or ≥12 months until disenrollment, study end, or death, and grouped into 2-month cohorts based on postindex PSADT. Cox regression models assessed association between PSADT, time to metastasis, and death. Healthcare resource utilization and costs were evaluated.  Results:   Among 2800 evaluable patients, median follow-up was 30 months and median PSADT was 17 months. Relative to the reference cohort (PSADT >12 months), all cohorts had significantly higher metastasis risk. PSADT ≤10-month cohorts had significantly greater mortality risk than the reference; hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) ranged from 12.3 (9.2, 16.4) in the PSADT ≤2-month cohort to 1.3 (0.9, 2.0) in the >10 to ≤12-month cohort. Total costs were significantly higher for cohorts up to and including the PSADT >8 to ≤10-month cohort, than for the reference cohort. Mean per patient per month all-cause medical plus pharmacy costs were $6623, $4768, and $4049 in the PSADT ≤2-month, >2 to ≤4-month cohort, and >4 to ≤6-month cohorts, respectively, versus $1911 in the PSADT >12-month cohort (P <0.05).  Conclusion:   Most patients with nmCRPC have PSADT >12 months and a long natural history. For those with shorter PSADT, the risk of metastasis, death, and costs increased.

We hypothesize that a higher pretreatment Halabi score is associated with worse QOL outcomes over time in mCRPC patients.  Methods:   Patient-level data from the docetaxel plus prednisone control arm of Mainsail, a Phase 3 clinical trial in mCRPC were accessed via ProjectDataSphere. Pretreatment Halabi score included disease-related factors: metastatic site, opioid use, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG-PS), alkaline phosphatase, albumin, hemoglobin, lactic acid dehydrogenase, and PSA, with higher score indicating worse survival. Three QOL scales were created: Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P, higher score = better QOL), Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form Severity score (BPI-SFSS, higher score = higher pain severity), and BPI-SF Interference score (BPI-SFIS, higher score = greater pain interference). Mixed linear model was used to estimate the associations between Halabi score and QOL scores assessed at different time points (baseline, 2 months, and 6 months).  Results:   This analysis included 412 mCRPC patients (median age = 68 years, 82% white, 5% Black, median log PSA = 4.4 ng/mL). After multivariable adjustment, Halabi score was significantly associated with QOL scores at all time points. At 6 months, multivariable adjusted FACT-P decreased by 10.0 points (worsening), BPI-SFSS increased by 0.8 points (worsening), and BPI-SFIS increased by 0.9 points (worsening) for each unit increase in Halabi risk score. In multivariable analysis of individual components, ECOG-PS, site of metastasis, and opioid use were significantly associated with worse QOL scores at baseline.

To determine the prevalence of these genes in a noninfection (i.e., colonized) state, we screened urine specimens in men before undergoing a biopsy for prostate cancer detection.  Methods:   We developed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction using three of the most described bacterial genotoxin gene primers: Colibactin (polyketone synthase [pks] gene island: clbN and clbB), cytotoxic necrotizing factor (cnf1) toxin, and cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) represented gene islands. After calibration on Escherichia coli samples of known genotypes, we used a training and validation cohort. We performed multiplex testing on a training cohort of previously collected urine from 45 men undergoing prostate biopsy. For the validation cohort, we utilized baseline urine samples from a previous randomized clinical trial (n = 263) with known prostate cancer outcomes.  Results:   The prevalence of four common bacterial genotoxin genes detected in the urine before prostate biopsy for prostate cancer is 8% (25/311). The prevalence of pks island (clbN and clbB), cnf1, and cdt toxin genes are 6.1%, 2.4%, and 1.7%, respectively. We found no association between urinary genotoxins and prostate cancer (p = 0.83).

However, these drugs have not always presented a safe profile and were reported to induce local adverse events. Protein-based anticancer drugs, such as immune checkpoint and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors, do not induce tissue injury, nor do they exhibit vesicant properties upon direct contact with tissues. Protein drugs are susceptible to the heat and stress encountered during droplet generation for delivery by nebulization. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of atezolizumab, an antibody to programmed death ligand 1, to bind target cells after nebulization with a vibrating mesh (VM) nebulizer.  Materials and methods:   We compared Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectra of native atezolizumab (60 mg/ml) and its nebulized form following 10-min nebulization in a piezoceramic VM nebulizer. The binding of atezolizumab to DU-145 prostate cancer cells was evaluated using competitive blocking of anti-CD274 staining.  Results:   Nebulization did not induce Raman or FTIR spectral modification nor did it affect the binding capacity of atezolizumab. Conversely, heat-inactivated atezolizumab lost its cell-binding capacity and did not reduce anti-CD274 immunostaining. Native and nebulized atezolizumab displayed identical spectra, whereas the FTIR spectra of the heat-inactivated drug was significantly altered.

Although prostate cancer cells grow slowly in the local original site, once the cancer cells spread to distant organs they grow rapidly and show very aggressive features. Cortactin is a protein that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and plays crucial roles in cancer metastasis. Up-regulated cortactin is correlated with the metastatic capacity of prostate cancer cells. AHCC®, a standardized extract of cultured Lentinula edodes mycelia, has been previously reported to have cortactin-down-regulating effects on human pancreatic cancer cells. In the present study, the effects of AHCC® treatment on cortactin levels in prostate cancer cells was evaluated.  Materials and methods:   LNCaP.FGC, DU145, and PC-3 are human prostate cancer cell lines. LNCaP.FGC is well differentiated, androgen-dependent, and poorly metastatic. DU145 is less differentiated, androgen-independent, and moderate metastatic. PC-3 is less differentiated, androgen-independent, and highly metastatic. The effects of AHCC® treatment on cortactin levels in prostate cancer cells was evaluated by western blot.  Results:   In vitro AHCC® treatment decreased cortactin levels in LNCaP.FGC and DU145 cells but did not change those in PC-3 cells.

We examined the outcomes of Japanese patients with mCSPC who received ARAT as second-line therapy or afterwards.  Patients and methods:   Among the PC patients receiving treatment at Kanazawa University Hospital from 2000 to 2019, 190 patients with mCSPC were enrolled in the study. Their characteristics and prognosis were retrospectively investigated.  Results:   All patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as initial treatment. A total of 142 (74.3%) of 190 patients had progression to castration-resistant PC (CRPC), of whom 77 (54.2%) received ARAT as second-line therapy or afterwards. The median overall survival (OS) of CRPC patients was 70.57 months and the median OS from CRPC was 44.88 months.

His meticulous modeling and collaborations across the field have offered a prime example of how research can be taken from the bench to the bedside and back, with the ultimate goal of providing benefit to patients. Much of the focus of John's work was on mitigating damage to the kidney, whether as the result of accidental or deliberate clinical exposures. Following in his footsteps, we offer here a brief overview of work conducted in the field of radiation-induced bladder injury. We then describe our own preclinical experimental studies which originated as a response to reports from a clinical genome-wide association study (GWAS) investigating genomic biomarkers of normal tissue toxicity in prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. In particular, we discuss the use of Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) inhibitors as modulators of injury, agents championed by the Moulder group, and how RAS inhibitors are associated with a reduction in some measures of toxicity. Using a murine model, along with precise CT-image guided irradiation of the bladder using single and fractionated dosing regimens, we have been able to demonstrate radiation-induced functional injury to the bladder and mitigation of this functional damage by an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme targeting the RAS, an experimental approach akin to that used by the Moulder group. We consider our scientific trajectory as a bedside-to-bench approach because the observation was made clinically and investigated in a preclinical model; this experimental approach aligns with the exemplary career of Dr. John Moulder.  Conclusions:   Despite the differences in functional endpoints, recent findings indicate a commonality between bladder late effects and the work in kidney pioneered by Dr. John Moulder.

Methods: A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, through October 20, 2022 according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We used odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess the strength of the association between the PSCA rs2294008 (C/T) polymorphism and cancer risk. In addition, we explored PSCA mRNA expression in cancers through online databases. Results: In total, 45 articles met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed, including 37,586 cancer cases and 51,197 non-cancer controls. Except in the recessive model, the pooled effect indicated the PSCA rs2294008 T allele was associated with an increased overall cancer risk (T vs. C: OR = 1.120, 95% CI = 1.056-1.188, p < 0.01; TT vs. CC: OR = 1.206, 95% CI = 1.066-1.364, p = 0.03; CT vs. CC: OR = 1.249, 95% CI = 1.151-1.356, p < 0.01; [CT+TT] vs. CC: OR = 1.248, 95% CI = 1.147-1.359, p < 0.01; TT vs. [CT+CC]: OR = 1.051, 95% CI = 0.954-1.156, p = 0.314). In the subgroup analysis, there were significant associations between the rs2294008 T allele and increased risk of bladder and gastric cancer. Two different online tools were used to explore the PSCA mRNA levels in cancer and the corresponding normal adjacent tissues.

Recent studies estimate that over 1.4 million males are diagnosed with prostate cancer on an annual basis, with approximately 375,000 succumbing to the disease annually. With current treatments continuing to show severe side effects, there is a need for new treatments. In this study we looked at the effect of cannabis sativa extract, cannabidiol and cisplatin on prostate cancer cells, PC3.  Methods:   In addressing the above questions, we employed the MTT assay to measure the antiproliferative effect on PC3 cells following treatment with varying concentrations of Cannabis sativa extract, cisplatin and cannabidiol. xCELLigence was also used to confirm the IC50 activity in which cells were grown in a 16 well plate coated with gold and monitor cell attachment. Caspase 3/7 activity was also measured using 96 well-plate following treatment. Western-blot and qRT-PCR was also used to measure the gene expression of tumour suppressor genes, p53, Bax and Bcl2. Animal studies were employed to measure the growth of PC3-mouse derived cancer to evaluate the effect of compounds in vivo.  Results:   From the treatment with varying concentrations of Cannabis sativa extract, cannabidiol and cisplatin, we have observed that the three compounds induced antiproliferation of PC3 cancer cell lines through the activation of caspase 3/7 activity. We also observed induction of apoptosis in these cells following silencing of retinoblastoma binding protein 6 (RBBP6), with upregulation of p53 and bax mRNA expression, and a reduction in Bcl2 gene expression. The growth of tumours in the mouse models were reduced following treatment with cisplatin and cannabidiol.

This present study is a retrospective study evaluating the correlations between the biochemical efficacy, and treatment toxicity in SBRT for localized prostate cancer.  Methods:   All organ-confined prostate cancer patients treated with SBRT from 2010 to 2018, at Beacon Hospital, Malaysia were included in this study. Patient demographics, dosimetric parameters, and disease information were retrospectively collected. The primary endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival assessed using the Phoenix definition (Nadir + 2 ng/mL). Toxicity outcomes were scored using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale.  Results:   Fourty-nine patients who met the inclusion criteria (5 low-, 13 intermediate- and 31 high-risk according to the D'amico Risk Classification) received SBRT. The most common dose regime was 34-35Gy in 5 fractions (n=18). Other dose regimes were 24Gy in 3 fractions and 25-33Gy in 5 fractions. Median follow-up was 45.4 months. The median pre-treatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 11.22 ng/mL, which decreased to a median PSA of 0.1 ng/mL by 2 years post-treatment. Out of the 49 cases, only 1 case of biochemical recurrence occurred, yielding a 3- and 5-year overall survival of 100%, and a 3- and 5- year biochemical recurrence-free rate of 100% and 95.2%.

Studies suggest that patients with testosterone levels below 0.7 nM have a longer time to castration resistance. Using the most accurate testosterone measurement method, namely mass spectrometry (MS), we sought to determine if a lower testosterone level under ADT could be associated with longer time to castration resistance.  Methods:   This retrospective study included 138 prostate cancer patients undergoing noncurative continuous ADT for which we had access to testosterone measurements assessed by MS. For 108 samples, paired immunoassays (IA) testosterone measurement was available. Primary outcome was time to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). The Contal and O'Quigley method was used to determine the optimal testosterone castration cut-off point considering the outcome and time-to-event variables. Relationship between testosterone levels assessed either by IA or MS and time to CRPC was evaluated using Cox regression.  Results:   Mean testosterone level was 0.370 nM by IA and 0.275 nM as assessed by MS. The optimal testosterone cut-off point identified to predict time to CRPC was of 0.705 nM for IA and of 0.270 nM for MS. While no significant difference for time to CRPC was found between patients showing IA testosterone level ≥0.705 nM versus <0.705 nM (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.579; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.908-2.745), patients with MS testosterone ≥0.270 nM had an increased risk of progression to CRPC compared to MS testosterone <0.270 nM in univariate (HR: 1.717; 95% CI: 1.160-2.541) and multivariate analysis (HR: 1.662; 95% CI: 1.043-2.648).  Conclusions:   The higher sensitivity of MS testosterone measurement methods allows the identification of a lower castration threshold and leads to early identification of patients more likely to progress to CRPC. These patients would likely benefit from treatment intensification by androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies to delay disease progression.""","""['Jérémie Beck', 'Mélanie Rouleau', 'Francis Lemire', 'Bertrand Neveu', 'Michel Déry', 'Benoît Thériault', 'Gabriel Dubois', 'Dominique Guérette', 'Frédéric Pouliot']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

We aimed to define sex-specific risk of preceding cancer in patients with a first-time VTE by conducting a nationwide Swedish registry-based study including 298 172 patients with VTE and 1 185 079 matched controls. This included 44 685 patients with a diagnosis of cancer at/or within 1 year before a VTE diagnosis. Female patients with VTE had a higher multivariable adjusted odds ratios of preceding cancer than male patients with VTE (5.5 [99% confidence interval 5.4-5.7] vs 3.9 [3.8-4.0]). The highest risk of cancer in patients with VTE were found for pancreatic cancer (women: 19.6 [15.8-24.4]; men: 17.2 [13.7-21.6]) and brain cancer (women: 17.4 [12.9-23.4]; men: 17.5 [13.8-22.2]). Weak associations were seen between VTE and bladder/urothelial cancer (women: 1.31 [1.12-1.53]; men: 1.34 [1.23-1.47]), prostate cancer (men: 2.17 [2.07-2.27]), malignant melanoma (women: 2.51 [2.07-3.05]; men: 2.67 [2.23-3.18]), and kidney cancer (women: 3.20 [2.49-4.11]; men: 3.33 [2.79-4.07]).

VC2 replicates efficiently in epithelial cell culture but produces lower viral titers and smaller viral plaques than its parental HSV-1 (F) wild-type virus. VC2 is an effective live-attenuated vaccine against HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in mice and guinea pigs and an anti-tumor immunotherapeutic and oncolytic virus against melanoma and breast cancer in mouse models. Previously, we reported that the gK/UL20 complex interacts with the UL37 tegument protein, and this interaction is essential for virion intracellular envelopment and egress. To investigate the potential role of the UL37 deamidase functions, the recombinant virus FC819S and VC2C819S were constructed with a C819S substitution to inactivate the UL37 predicted deamidase active site on an HSV-1(F) and HSV-1(VC2) genetic background, respectively. FC819S replicated to similar levels with HSV-1(F) and produced similar size viral plaques. In contrast, VC2C819S replication was enhanced, and viral plaques increased in size, approaching those of the wild-type HSV-1(F) virus. FC819S infection of cell cultures caused enhanced GM-CSF secretion in comparison to HSV-1(F) across several cell lines, including HEp2 cells and cancer cell lines, DU145 (prostate) and Panc 04.03 (pancreas), and primary mouse peritoneal cells. VC2 infection of these cell lines caused GM-CSF secretion at similar levels to FC819S infection. However, the VC2C819S virus did not exhibit any further enhancement of GM-CSF secretion compared to the VC2 virus. These results suggest that the UL37 deamidation functions in conjunction with the gK/UL20 complex to facilitate virus replication and GM-CSF secretion.""","""['Carolyn M Clark', 'Nithya Jambunathan', 'Therese M A Collantes', 'Konstantin G Kousoulas']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Viruses""","""['Herpes simplex virus 1 protein UL37 interacts with viral glycoprotein gK and membrane protein UL20 and functions in cytoplasmic virion envelopment.', 'A single intramuscular vaccination of mice with the HSV-1 VC2 virus with mutations in the glycoprotein K and the membrane protein UL20 confers full protection against lethal intravaginal challenge with virulent HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains.', 'Functional hierarchy of herpes simplex virus 1 viral glycoproteins in cytoplasmic virion envelopment and egress.', 'The HSV-1 live attenuated VC2 vaccine provides protection against HSV-2 genital infection in the guinea pig model of genital herpes.', 'Role of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 (HSV-1) Glycoprotein K (gK) Pathogenic CD8+ T Cells in Exacerbation of Eye Disease.']"""
