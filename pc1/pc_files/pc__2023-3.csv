Although the long-term clinical significance of acting on these findings is unknown, it has been shown that the risk of upstaging is prognostic for long-term outcomes in men with high-risk (HR) or very high-risk (VHR) PCa. We evaluated the association between the risk of upstaging on PSMA PET and the Decipher genomic classifier score, a known prognostic biomarker in localized PCa that is being evaluated for its predictive ability to direct systemic therapy intensification. In a cohort of 4625 patients with HR or VHR PCa, the risk of upstaging on PSMA PET was significantly correlated with the Decipher score (p < 0.001). These results should be seen as hypothesis-generating and warrant further studies on the causal pathways linking PSMA findings, Decipher scores, extraprostatic disease, and long-term clinical outcomes. PATIENT SUMMARY: We found significant correlation between the risk of having prostate cancer outside the prostate gland on a sensitive scan (based on prostate-specific membrane antigen [PSMA]) at initial staging and the Decipher genetic score. The results warrant further studies on the causal pathways between PSMA scan findings, Decipher scores, disease outside the prostate, and long-term outcomes.""","""['Clayton P Smith', 'James A Proudfoot', 'Paul C Boutros', 'Robert E Reiter', 'Luca Valle', 'Matthew B Rettig', 'Nicholas G Nickols', 'Felix Y Feng', 'Paul L Nguyen', 'Himanshu Nagar', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Gert Attard', 'Adam Weiner', 'Joanne B Weidhaas', 'Jeremie Calais', 'T Martin Ma', 'Elai Davicioni', 'Michael Xiang', 'Amar U Kishan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Compared with Conventional Imaging for Initial Staging of Treatment-naïve Intermediate- and High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Single-center Study.', 'Identifying the Best Candidates for Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography as the Primary Staging Approach Among Men with High-risk Prostate Cancer and Negative Conventional Imaging.', ""Metastatic Sites' Location and Impact on Patient Management After the Introduction of Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography in Newly Diagnosed and Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer: A Critical Review."", 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

This subdivision may be less applicable in the modern era in which imaging-targeted prostate biopsies are common practice. In our large institutional active surveillance cohort of patients diagnosed from 2000 to 2020 (n = 1276), the number of patients meeting NCCN VLR criteria decreased significantly in recent years, with no patient meeting VLR criteria after 2018. By contrast, the multivariable Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score effectively substratified patients over the same period and was predictive of upgrading on repeat biopsy to Gleason grade group ≥2 on multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression modeling (hazard ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.39; p < 0.01), independent of age, genomic test results, and magnetic resonance imaging findings. These findings suggest that the NCCN VLR criteria are less applicable in the targeted biopsy era, and that the CAPRA score or similar instruments are better contemporary risk stratification tools for men on active surveillance. PATIENT SUMMARY: We investigated whether the National Comprehensive Cancer Network classification of very low risk (VLR) for prostate cancer is relevant in the modern era. We found that in a large group of patients on active surveillance, no man diagnosed after 2018 satisfied the VLR criteria. However, the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score discriminated patients by cancer risk at diagnosis and was predictive of outcomes on active surveillance, and thus may be a more relevant classification scheme in the modern era.""","""['Kevin Shee', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Ashwin Balakrishnan', 'Domenique Escobar', 'Kevin Chang', 'Samuel L Washington rd', 'Hao G Nguyen', 'Katsuto Shinohara', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Peter R Carroll']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['A Biopsy-based 17-gene Genomic Prostate Score as a Predictor of Metastases and Prostate Cancer Death in Surgically Treated Men with Clinically Localized Disease.', 'Role of Metabolic Syndrome on Perioperative and Oncological Outcomes at Radical Prostatectomy in a Low-risk Prostate Cancer Cohort Potentially Eligible for Active Surveillance.', 'Adverse Pathologic Findings for Men Electing Immediate Radical Prostatectomy: Defining a Favorable Intermediate-Risk Group.', 'Identifying intermediate-risk candidates for active surveillance of prostate cancer.', 'Risk of adverse pathology at prostatectomy in the era of MRI and targeted biopsies; rethinking active surveillance for intermediate risk prostate cancer patients.']"""

The HA-rich microenvironment and receptors of HA have been suggested to play roles in cancer progression. The biological and clinical significance of receptor for HA-mediated motility (RHAMM), known as CD168 in prostate cancer (PC) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the expression of RHAMM, as well as its functional and clinical relevance in PC.  Materials and methods:   HA concentration and RHAMM mRNA expression were examined in 3 PC cell lines (LNCaP, PC3 and DU145). We investigated the effect of HA and RHAMM on the migratory ability of PC cells using a transwell migration assay. Immunohistochemistry was also used to evaluate the RHAMM expression pattern in pre-treatment tissue samples from 99 patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC (HSPC) who received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).  Results:   HA was secreted in all cultured PC cell lines. Among the total HA, low-molecular-weight HA (LMW-HA) (<100 kDa) was detected all examined cell lines. The number of migration cells was significantly increased by adding LMW-HA. RHAMM mRNA expression was increased in DU145 cells. Knockdown of RHAMM using small-interfering RNA resulted in decreased cell migration. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed strong RHAMM expression in 31 (31.3%) patients with metastatic HSPC. A strong RHAMM expression was significantly associated with short ADT duration and poor survival in univariate and multivariate analyses.  Conclusion:   The size of HA is important in terms of PC progression. LMW-HA and RHAMM enhanced PC cell migration. RHAMM could be used as a novel prognostic marker in patients with metastatic HSPC.""","""['Akinori Minato', 'Yuzan Kudo', 'Hirotsugu Noguchi', 'Shiro Kohi', 'Yoshitaka Hasegawa', 'Norihiro Sato', 'Keiji Hirata', 'Naohiro Fujimoto']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Genomics Proteomics""","""['Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (RHAMM) immunohistochemical expression and androgen deprivation in normal peritumoral, hyperplasic and neoplastic prostate tissue.', 'Redox Responsive Hyaluronic Acid Nanogels for Treating RHAMM (CD168) Over-expressive Cancer, both Primary and Metastatic Tumors.', 'Negative regulation between the expression levels of receptor for hyaluronic acid-mediated motility and hyaluronan leads to cell migration in pancreatic cancer.', 'RHAMM, a receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility, on normal human lymphocytes, thymocytes and malignant B cells: a mediator in B cell malignancy?', 'Interactions between Hyaluronan and Its Receptors (CD44, RHAMM) Regulate the Activities of Inflammation and Cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   183 patients recruited to the VoxTox study (UK-CRN-ID-13716) were included. Toxicity scores were prospectively collected after 2 years with grade ≥ 1 proctitis, haemorrhage (CTCAEv4.03); and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (RTOG) recorded as the endpoints of interest. The rectal wall on each slice was divided into 4 regions according to the centroid, and all slices were divided into 4 sections to calculate region-level radiomic and dosimetric features. The patients were split into a training set (75%, N = 137) and a test set (25%, N = 46). Highly correlated features were removed using four feature selection methods. Individual radiomic or dosimetric or combined (radiomic + dosimetric) features were subsequently classified using three machine learning classifiers to explore their association with these radiation-induced rectal toxicities.  Results:   The test set area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.549, 0.741 and 0.669 for proctitis, haemorrhage and GI toxicity prediction using radiomic combined with dosimetric features. The AUC value reached 0.747 for the ensembled radiomic-dosimetric model for haemorrhage.

Problems arise when the target volume can only be matched partially due to inter-fractional organ motion and deformation, resulting in deteriorated target coverage and critical structure sparing. A new target localization method is investigated in which the treatment target volume is aligned with the prescription isodose surface. Our study included 15 prostate patients previously treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Patient setup and target localization were performed using a CT-on-rails system before and after the IMRT treatment. IMRT plans were generated on the original simulation CTs (15) and the same MUs and leaf sequences were used to compute the dose distributions on post-treatment CTs (98) with the isocenter adjustments based on either anatomical structure matching or prescription isodose surface alignment. When patients were aligned with the traditional anatomy matching method, the dose to 95% of the CTV, D95, received 74.0 - 77.6 Gy and the minimum CTV dose, Dmin, was 61.9 - 71.6 Gy, respectively, in the cumulative dose distributions. The rectal dose-volume constraints were violated in 35.7% of the treatment fractions. When patients were aligned using the new localization method, the dose to 95% of the CTV, D95, received 74.0 - 78.2 Gy and the minimum CTV dose, Dmin, was 68.4 - 71.6 Gy, respectively, in the cumulative dose distributions. The rectal dose-volume constraints were violated in 17.3% of the treatment fractions. Traditional IGRT target localization based on anatomy matching is effective for population-based PTV margins but not ideal for those patients with large inter-fractional prostate rotation/deformation due to large rectal and bladder volume variation. The new method using the prescription isodose surface to align the target volume could improve the target coverage and rectal sparing for these patients, which can be implemented clinically to improve target dose delivery accuracy.""","""['C M Charlie Ma', 'Guoping Shan', 'Wei Hu', 'Robert A Price', 'Lili Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Phys Med""","""['Dosimetric evaluation of image-guided radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Assessment and management of interfractional variations in daily diagnostic-quality-CT guided prostate-bed irradiation after prostatectomy.', 'Target miss using PTV-based IMRT compared to robust optimization via coverage probability concept in prostate cancer.', 'SU-E-J-07: Image Guided Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer: To Shift Or to Re-Plan?', 'Dosimetric and radiobiological consequences of computed tomography-guided adaptive strategies for intensity modulated radiation therapy of the prostate.']"""

Clathrin and caveolin-1 proteins play a major role in receptor-mediated endocytosis. We have used a quantitative, unbiased and semi-automated method to measure in situ protein expression of clathrin and caveolin-1 in cancerous and paired normal (cancer adjacent, non-cancerous) human prostate tissue. There was a significant (p < 0.0001) increase in the expression of clathrin in prostate cancer samples (N = 29, n = 91) compared to normal tissue (N = 29, n = 67) (N = number of patients, n = number of cores in tissue arrays). Conversely, there was a significant (p < 0.0001) decrease in expression of caveolin-1 in prostate cancer tissue compared to normal prostate tissue. The opposite change in expression of the two proteins was highly correlated to increasing cancer aggressiveness. There was also a concurrent increase in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a key receptor in carcinogenesis, with clathrin in prostate cancer tissue, indicating recycling of EGFR through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). These results indicate that in prostate cancer, caveolin-1-mediated endocytosis (CavME) may be acting as a brake and increase in CME may facilitate tumorigenicity and aggressiveness of prostate cancer through recycling of EGFR.

Treatment burden is associated with poorer patient outcomes in several chronic diseases. Illness burden has been extensively studied in cancer, but little is known about treatment burden, particularly in those who have completed primary treatment for cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate treatment burden in survivors of prostate and colorectal cancers and their caregivers.  Design:   Semistructured interview study. Interviews were analysed using Framework and thematic analysis.  Setting:   Participants were recruited via general practices in Northeast Scotland.  Participants:   Eligible participants were individuals who had been diagnosed with colorectal or prostate cancer without distant metastases within the previous 5 years and their caregivers. Thirty-five patients and six caregivers participated: 22 patients had prostate and 13 had colorectal cancers (six male, seven female).  Results:   The term 'burden' did not resonate with most survivors, who expressed gratitude that time invested in cancer care could translate into improved survival. Cancer management was time consuming, but workload reduced over time. Cancer was usually considered as a discrete episode. Individual, disease and health system factors protected against or increased treatment burden. Some factors, such as health service configuration, were potentially modifiable. Multimorbidity contributed most to treatment burden and influenced treatment decisions and engagement with follow-up. The presence of a caregiver protected against treatment burden, but caregivers also experienced burden.  Conclusions:   Intensive cancer treatment and follow-up regimens do not necessarily lead to perceived burden. A cancer diagnosis serves as a strong motivator to engage in health management, but a careful balance exists between positive perceptions and burden. Treatment burden could lead to poorer cancer outcomes by influencing engagement with and decisions about care. Clinicians should ask about treatment burden and its impact, particularly in those with multimorbidity.

High-risk/very high-risk patients had significantly higher rates of stress urinary incontinence at postoperative week 1 (75.8% vs. 28.9%) and month 1 (63.6% vs. 26.3%) than the below high-risk group (both p < 0.01). Rates of stress urinary incontinence after RaRP did not differ between two groups from postoperative 3 months to 12 months. The factor of high-risk / very high-risk group was a predictor of immediate but not for long-term postoperative stress urinary incontinence.  Conclusions:   High-risk and very high-risk prostate cancer patients receiving a combination of RaRP and adjuvant treatment had comparable biochemical recurrence-free survival to below high-risk prostate cancer patients. The high-risk/very high-risk factor impeded early but not long-term postoperative recovery of continence.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common burden associated with increasing age as well as prostate cancer treatment. Although many studies have investigated the factors affecting erectile dysfunction (ED) after prostate cancer treatment, only limited studies have investigated whether ED can be predicted before the start of treatment. The advent of machine learning (ML) based prediction tools in oncology offers a promising approach to improve the accuracy of prediction and quality of care. Predicting ED may help aid shared decision-making by making the advantages and disadvantages of certain treatments clear, so that a tailored treatment for an individual patient can be chosen. This study aimed to predict ED at 1-year and 2-year post-diagnosis based on patient demographics, clinical data and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) measured at diagnosis. We used a subset of the ProZIB dataset collected by the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization (Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland; IKNL) that contained information on 964 localized prostate cancer cases from 69 Dutch hospitals for model training and external validation. Two models were generated using a logistic regression algorithm coupled with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). The first predicted ED 1 year post-diagnosis and required 10 pre-treatment variables; the second predicted ED 2 years post-diagnosis with 9 pre-treatment variables. The validation AUCs were 0.84 and 0.81 for 1 year and 2 years post-diagnosis respectively. To immediately allow patients and clinicians to use these models in the clinical decision-making process, nomograms were generated. In conclusion, we successfully developed and validated two models that predicted ED in patients with localized prostate cancer. These models will allow physicians and patients alike to make informed evidence-based decisions about the most suitable treatment with quality of life in mind.""","""['Hajar Hasannejadasl', 'Cheryl Roumen', 'Henk van der Poel', 'Ben Vanneste', 'Joep van Roermund', 'Katja Aben', 'Petros Kalendralis', 'Biche Osong', 'Lambertus Kiemeney', 'Inge Van Oort', 'Renee Verwey', 'Laura Hochstenbach', 'Esther J Bloemen-van Gurp', 'Andre Dekker', 'Rianne R R Fijten']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['A comparison of machine learning models for predicting urinary incontinence in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Prediction of erectile function following treatment for prostate cancer.', 'Prevalence of Baseline Erectile Dysfunction (ED) in an Australian Cohort of Men with Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'The Natural History of Erectile Dysfunction After Prostatic Radiotherapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'A comparison of machine learning models for predicting urinary incontinence in men with localized prostate cancer.']"""

Recent research reported the role of DOK3 in tumor progression, with opposite effects in lung cancer and gliomas; however, its role in prostate cancer (PCa) remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the role of DOK3 in PCa and to determine the mechanisms involved.  Methods:   To investigate the functions and mechanisms of DOK3 in PCa, we performed bioinformatic and biofunctional analyses. Samples from patients with PCa were collected from West China Hospital, and 46 were selected for the final correlation analysis. A lentivirus-based short hairpin ribonucleic acid (shRNA) carrier was established for silencing DOK3. A series of experiments involving the cell counting kit-8, bromodeoxyuridine, and flow cytometry assays were performed to identify cell proliferation and apoptosis. Changes in biomarkers from the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway were detected to verify the relationship between DOK3 and the NF-κB pathway. A subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was performed to examine phenotypes after knocking down DOK3 in vivo . Rescue experiments with DOK3 knockdown and NF-κB pathway activation were designed to verify regulating effects.  Results:   DOK3 was up-regulated in PCa cell lines and tissues. In addition, a high level of DOK3 was predictive of higher pathological stages and worse prognoses. Similar results were observed with PCa patient samples. After silencing DOK3 in PCa cell lines 22RV1 and PC3, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited while apoptosis was promoted. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that DOK3 function was enriched in the NF-κB pathway. Mechanism experiments determined that knockdown of DOK3 suppressed activation of the NF-κB pathway, increased the expressions of B-cell lymphoma-2 like 11 (BIM) and B-cell lymphoma-2 associated X (BAX), and decreased the expression of phosphorylated-P65 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). In the rescue experiments, pharmacological activation of NF-κB by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) partially recovered cell proliferation after the knockdown of DOK3.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest that overexpression of DOK3 promotes PCa progression by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway.""","""['Kun Jin', 'Shi Qiu', 'Bo Chen', 'Zilong Zhang', 'Chichen Zhang', 'Xianghong Zhou', 'Lu Yang', 'Jianzhong Ai', 'Qiang Wei']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Chin Med J (Engl)""","""['P76RBE silencing inhibits ovarian cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion via suppressing the integrin β1/NF-κB pathway.', 'TRIM29 Overexpression Promotes Proliferation and Survival of Bladder Cancer Cells through NF-κB Signaling.', 'Alpha-tomatine attenuation of in vivo growth of subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft tumors of human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells is accompanied by inactivation of nuclear factor-kappa B signaling.', 'Suppression of constitutive and tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation and induction of apoptosis by apigenin in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells: correlation with down-regulation of NF-kappaB-responsive genes.', 'Suppression of LASP-1 attenuates the carcinogenesis of prostatic cancer cell lines: Key role of the NF-κB pathway.', 'Expression and clinical significance of DOK3 in renal clear cell carcinoma.']"""

Proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation techniques suggested that CPS-B modulated autophagy in prostate cancer (PC). Moreover, Western blotting showed that both autophagy and epithelial-mesenchymal transition occurred place after CPS-B treatment in vivo, which was also proven in PC-3 cancer cells. We deduced that CPS-B inhibited migration by inducing autophagy. We examined the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells, and in downstream pathways, LKB1 and AMPK were activated while mTOR was inhibited. Transwell experiment results showed that CPS-B inhibited the metastasis of PC-3 cells and that this effect was significantly attenuated after pretreatment with chloroquine, indicating that CPS-B inhibited metastasis via autophagy induction.

We evaluated the PDT effect, using methylene blue as a photosensitizer, in human prostate tumor cells (PC3). PC3 were subjected to four different conditions: DMEM (control); laser treatment (L-660 nm, 100 mW, 100 J.cm-2); methylene blue treatment (MB-25 μM, 30 min), and MB treatment followed by low-level red laser irradiation (MB-PDT). Groups were evaluated after 24 h. MB-PDT treatment reduced cell viability and migration. However, because MB-PDT did not significantly increase the levels of active caspase-3 and BCL-2, apoptosis was not the primary mode of cell death. MB-PDT, on the other hand, increased the acid compartment by 100% and the LC3 immunofluorescence (an autophagy marker) by 254%. Active MLKL level, a necroptosis marker, was higher in PC3 cells after MB-PDT treatment. Furthermore, MB-PDT resulted in oxidative stress due to a decrease in total antioxidant potential, catalase levels, and increased lipid peroxidation.

Cases were performed by two surgeons. An enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) programme was used. The feasibility of same-day discharge was analysed, along with the complication rate, oncological outcomes, and postoperative patient experience.  Results:   Of 180 patients, 169 (93.8%) were successfully discharged on the same day as surgery. The median (range) age was 63 ( 44-74) years. The median (range) console time was 97 (61-256) min and blood loss was 200 (20-800) mL. The resection specimen pathology results were: pT2 69.4%, pT3a 24.4% and pT3b 6.5%.

Method:   A retrospective assessment of 139 patients who had radical cystectomy for urothelial cancer between March 2015 and July 2021 from Fiona Stanley Hospital (Perth, Australia) by a single surgeon was assessed. A change in pathological assessment process from assessment of only palpable lymph nodes to microscopic assessment of the entire submitted specimens occurred in August 2018. Patients were divided into two groups accordingly and other relevant demographic and pathological data was recorded. The impact of pathological processing technique on lymph node yield was assessed using the Student T test and logistical regression was used to assess the impact of other demographic variables.  Results:   The mean lymph node yield was 16.2 nodes (IQR 12-23) in 54 patients in the pre-process change group compared to 22.4 nodes (IQR 15-28.4) in 85 patients in the post-process change group (P < 0.0001). 53.7% had 16 or more nodes in the pre-process change group compared to 71.3% in the post-process change group (P = 0.04).

The four enriched pathways of the high-risk group were obtained by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and found to be associated with the tumorigenesis and development of PCa, including focal adhesion, TGF-β signaling pathway, adherens junction, and ECM receptor interaction. The high-risk groups had considerably higher levels of immune status and tumor immune cell infiltration, suggesting a more favorable response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. IHC found that the expression of the two FGF-related genes in the predictive signature was extremely different in PCa tissues.  Conclusion:   To summarize, our FGF-related risk signature may effectively predict and diagnose PCa, indicating that in PCa patients, they are potential therapeutic targets and promising prognostic biomarkers.""","""['Yongkang Ye', 'Rujun Mo', 'Ruinian Zheng', 'Jun Zou', 'Shaoqian Liu', 'Qiwu Mi', 'Weide Zhong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Dis Markers""","""['Development and Validation of an Inflammatory Response-Related Gene Signature for Predicting the Prognosis of Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.', 'A Novel Set of Immune-associated Gene Signature predicts Biochemical Recurrence in Localized Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Biochemical recurrence related metabolic novel signature associates with immunity and ADT treatment responses in prostate cancer.', 'A more novel and powerful prognostic gene signature of lung adenocarcinoma determined from the immune cell infiltration landscape.', 'Identification of a novel six autophagy-related genes signature for the prognostic and a miRNA-related autophagy predictor for anti-PD-1 therapy responses in prostate cancer.']"""

It is used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating inflammatory and infectious diseases. It has also shown good anti-cancer properties and has been tested against liver, colon, prostate, breast, and cervical cancers. However, no study has yet evaluated the role of goji berries against oral cancer. Hence, the present paper aims to evaluate the anticancer properties of L. barbarum against oral squamous cell carcinoma. Method: Ethanolic extract of L. barbarum (EELB) was tested for its anticancer properties by performing the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, colony formation, cell proliferation, and scratch wound test. The impact of EELB on the signaling transduction pathways of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), protein kinase (AKT1), cyclin D1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was also assessed by western blot. Results: The results showed that EELB can impede CAL-27 cell growth, proliferation and migration in-vitro. It even reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and AKT1 with concomitant downregulation of cyclin D1 (CCND1), cadherin 2 (CDH2), and vimentin (VIM) and upregulation of cadherin 1 (CDH1) expression suggesting its anti-proliferative and anti-EMT effects in oral cancer. Conclusion: Goji berry has good antiproliferative and anti-invasive properties. It affects potential EMT markers and signaling transduction pathways involved in oral cancers. Hence goji berry can be tried as a potential anticancer agent to manage oral squamous cell carcinoma.""","""['Amee Sanghavi', 'Ananth Srivatsa', 'Divya Adiga', 'Aditi Chopra', 'Richard Lobo', 'Shama Prasada Kabekkodu', 'Shivaprasada Gadag', 'Usha Nayak', 'Karthik Sivaraman', 'Ashmeet Shah']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""F1000Res""","""['Antimicrobial, anti-adhesion, anti-biofilm properties of goji berry (Lycium barbarum) against periodontal bacteria: potential benefits for periodontal diseases.', 'Anticancer effect of ethanol Lycium barbarum (Goji berry) extract on human breast cancer T47D cell line.', 'Phytochemical analysis and antioxidant activity of Lycium barbarum (Goji) cultivated in Greece.', 'Yeast Synthetic Biology for the Production of Lycium barbarum Polysaccharides.', 'Goji (Lycium barbarum and L. chinense): Phytochemistry, pharmacology and safety in the perspective of traditional uses and recent popularity.']"""

No study has previously assessed treatment outcome and survival following 225Ac-PSMA-617 treatment of de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate carcinoma (mHSPC) patients. Based on the potential side effects that are known and explained to the patients by the oncologist, some of the patients refused the standard treatment and are seeking alternative therapies. Thus, we report our preliminary findings in a retrospective series of 21 mHSPC patients that refused standard treatment options and were treated with 225Ac-PSMA-617.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed patients with histologically confirmed de novo treatment-naïve bone ± visceral mHSPC that were treated with 225Ac-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT). Inclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, treatment-naive bone ± visceral mHSPC, and patients refusal for ADT ± docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, or enzalutamide. We evaluated the response to treatment using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as the toxicities.  Results:   Twenty-one mHSPC patients were included in this preliminary work. Following treatment, twenty patients (95%) had any decline in PSA and eighteen patients (86%) presented with a PSA decline of ≥ 50% including 4 patients in whom PSA became undetectable. A lower percentage decrease in PSA following treatment was associated with increased mortality and shorter progression-free survival. Overall, administration of 225Ac-PSMA-617 was well tolerated. The commonest toxicity seen was grade I/II dry mouth observed in 94% of patients.  Conclusions:   Given these favorable results, randomized prospective multicenter trials assessing the clinical value of 225Ac-PSMA-617 as a therapeutic agent for mHSPC administered either as monotherapy or administered concomitant with ADT are of interest.""","""['Mike Sathekge', 'Frank Bruchertseifer', 'Mariza Vorster', 'Ismaheel O Lawal', 'Kgomotso Mokoala', 'Janet Reed', 'Letjie Maseremule', 'Honest Ndlovu', 'Khanyi Hlongwa', 'Alex Maes', 'Alfred Morgenstern', 'Christophe Van de Wiele']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['mCRPC Patients Receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 Therapy in the Post-Androgen Deprivation Therapy Setting: Response to Treatment and Survival Analysis.', 'Predictors of Overall and Disease-Free Survival in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving 225Ac-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy.', 'Activity and Adverse Events of Actinium-225-PSMA-617 in Advanced Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer After Failure of Lutetium-177-PSMA.', 'New treatment approaches for and ongoing trials in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Hematologic toxicity profile and efficacy of 225AcAc-PSMA-617 α-radioligand therapy of patients with extensive skeletal metastases of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PSMA-based alpha therapy in prostate cancer.', 'New tracers and combinations in radioligand therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Evaluation of Astatine-211-Labeled Fibroblast Activation Protein Inhibitor (FAPI): Comparison of Different Linkers with Polyethylene Glycol and Piperazine.']"""

Broader profiling revealed that covalent NONO ligands suppress an array of cancer-relevant genes and impair cancer cell proliferation. Surprisingly, these effects were not observed in cells genetically disrupted for NONO, which were instead resistant to NONO ligands. Reintroduction of wild-type NONO, but not a C145S mutant, restored ligand sensitivity in NONO-disrupted cells. The ligands promoted NONO accumulation in nuclear foci and stabilized NONO-RNA interactions, supporting a trapping mechanism that may prevent compensatory action of paralog proteins PSPC1 and SFPQ.

However, previous studies on plant-based diets and the risk of pancreatic cancer are scarce and fail to consider plant food quality.  Objectives:   We sought to examine the potential associations of 3 plant-based diet indices (PDIs) with the risk of pancreatic cancer in a US population.  Methods:   A population-based cohort of 101,748 US adults was identified from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. The overall PDI, healthful PDI (hPDI), and unhealthful PDI (uPDI) were constructed to qualify adherence to overall, healthy, and less healthy plant-based diets, respectively, with higher scores indicating better adherence. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for pancreatic cancer incidence. Subgroup analysis was conducted to identify the potential effect modifiers.  Results:   Over a mean follow-up of 8.86 years, 421 pancreatic cancer cases occurred. Participants in the highest compared with the lowest quartiles of overall PDI had a lower risk of pancreatic cancer [HRquartile 4 versus 1: 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.57, 0.96; Ptrend = 0.023]. A stronger inverse association was observed for hPDI (HRquartile 4 versus 1: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.75; Ptrend < 0.001). Conversely, uPDI was positively associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer (HRquartile 4 versus 1: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.85; Ptrend = 0.012). Subgroup analyses revealed a stronger positive association for uPDI in participants with BMI <25 (HRquartile 4 versus 1: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.56, 6.65) than in those with BMI ≥25 (HRquartile 4 versus 1: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.51) (Pinteraction = 0.001).

Early diagnosis and efficacious treatment options are highly warranted as far as the incidence of PCa is concerned. Androgen-dependent transcriptional activation of androgen receptor (AR) is central to the prostate tumorigenesis and therefore hormonal ablation therapy remains the first line of treatment for PCa in the clinics. However, the molecular signaling engaged in AR-dependent PCa initiation and progression is infrequent and diverse. Moreover, apart from the genomic changes, non-genomic changes such as epigenetic modifications have also been suggested as critical regulator of PCa development. Among the non-genomic mechanisms, various epigenetic changes such as histones modifications, chromatin methylation and noncoding RNAs regulations etc. play decisive role in the prostate tumorigenesis. Given that epigenetic modifications are reversible using pharmacological modifiers, various promising therapeutic approaches have been designed for the better management of PCa. In this chapter, we discuss the epigenetic control of tumor promoting AR signaling that underlies the mechanism of prostate tumorigenesis and progression.

The treatment of advanced-stage prostate cancer is always challenging due to limited drug treatment options, resulting in low survival rates. There is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the mechanisms associated with the effects of biomechanical cues by the interstitial fluid flow on prostate cancer cell growth and migration. We have designed a novel bioreactor system to demonstrate the impact of interstitial fluid flow on the migration of prostate cancer cells to the bone during extravasation. First, we demonstrated that a high flow rate induces apoptosis in PC3 cells via TGF-β1 mediated signaling; thus, physiological flow rate conditions are optimum for cell growth. Next, to understand the role of interstitial fluid flow in prostate cancer migration, we evaluated the migration rate of cells under static and dynamic conditions in the presence or absence of bone. We report that CXCR4 levels were not significantly changed under static and dynamic conditions, indicating that CXCR4 activation in PC3 cells is not influenced by flow conditions but by the bone, where CXCR4 levels were upregulated. The bone-upregulated CXCR4 levels led to increased MMP-9 levels resulting in a high migration rate in the presence of bone. In addition, upregulated levels ofαvβ3integrins under fluid flow conditions contributed to an overall increase in the migration rate of PC3 cells. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential role of interstitial fluid flow in prostate cancer invasion. Understanding the critical role of interstitial fluid flow in promoting prostate cancer cell progression will enhance current therapies for advanced-stage prostate cancer and provide improved treatment options for patients.""","""['Haneesh Jasuja', 'Sharad V Jaswandkar', 'Dinesh R Katti', 'Kalpana S Katti']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biofabrication""","""['CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions modulate prostate cancer cell migration, metalloproteinase expression and invasion.', 'Interstitial Fluid Flow Increases Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Invasion through CXCR4/CXCL12 and MEK/ERK Signaling.', 'Perfusion bioreactor enabled fluid-derived shear stress conditions for novel bone metastatic prostate cancer testbed.', 'TGF-β Effects on Prostate Cancer Cell Migration and Invasion Require FosB.', 'The importance of the CXCL12-CXCR4 chemokine ligand-receptor interaction in prostate cancer metastasis.']"""

META-PRISM tumors, particularly prostate, bladder, and pancreatic types, displayed the most transformed genomes compared with primary untreated tumors. Standard-of-care resistance biomarkers were identified only in lung and colon cancers-9.6% of META-PRISM tumors, indicating that too few resistance mechanisms have received clinical validation. In contrast, we verified the enrichment of multiple investigational and hypothetical resistance mechanisms in treated compared with nontreated patients, thereby confirming their putative role in treatment resistance. Additionally, we demonstrated that molecular markers improve 6-month survival prediction, particularly in patients with advanced breast cancer. Our analysis establishes the utility of the META-PRISM cohort for investigating resistance mechanisms and performing predictive analyses in cancer.  Significance:   This study highlights the paucity of standard-of-care markers that explain treatment resistance and the promise of investigational and hypothetical markers awaiting further validation.

Objective:   To characterize trends over time and practice- and practitioner-level variation in the use of AS in a large, national disease registry.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study included men with low-risk prostate cancer, defined as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) less than 10 ng/mL, Gleason grade group 1, and clinical stage T1c or T2a, newly diagnosed between January 1, 2014, and June 1, 2021. Patients were identified in the American Urological Association (AUA) Quality (AQUA) Registry, a large quality reporting registry including data from 1945 urology practitioners at 349 practices across 48 US states and territories, comprising more than 8.5 million unique patients. Data are collected automatically from electronic health record systems at participating practices.  Exposures:   Exposures of interest included patient age, race, and PSA level, as well as urology practice and individual urology practitioners.  Main outcomes and measures:   The outcome of interest was the use of AS as primary treatment. Treatment was determined through analysis of electronic health record structured and unstructured clinical data and determination of surveillance based on follow-up testing with at least 1 PSA level remaining greater than 1.0 ng/mL.  Results:   A total of 20 809 patients in AQUA were diagnosed with low-risk prostate cancer and had known primary treatment. The median age was 65 (IQR, 59-70) years; 31 (0.1%) were American Indian or Alaska Native; 148 (0.7%) were Asian or Pacific Islander; 1855 (8.9%) were Black; 8351 (40.1%) were White; 169 (0.8%) were of other race or ethnicity; and 10 255 (49.3%) were missing information on race or ethnicity. Rates of AS increased sharply and consistently from 26.5% in 2014 to 59.6% in 2021. However, use of AS varied from 4.0% to 78.0% at the urology practice level and from 0% to 100% at the practitioner level. On multivariable analysis, year of diagnosis was the variable most strongly associated with AS; age, race, and PSA value at diagnosis were all also associated with odds of surveillance.  Conclusions and relevance:   This cohort study of AS rates in the AQUA Registry found that national, community-based rates of AS have increased but remain suboptimal, and wide variation persists across practices and practitioners. Continued progress on this critical quality indicator is essential to minimize overtreatment of low-risk prostate cancer and by extension to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio of national prostate cancer early detection efforts.""","""['Matthew R Cooperberg', 'William Meeks', 'Raymond Fang', 'Franklin D Gaylis', 'William J Catalona', 'Danil V Makarov']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Regional Variation in Active Surveillance for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer in the US.', 'Contemporary use of initial active surveillance among men in Michigan with low-risk prostate cancer.', 'Association of Prostate-Specific Antigen Velocity With Clinical Progression Among African American and Non-Hispanic White Men Treated for Low-Risk Prostate Cancer With Active Surveillance.', 'An evidence review of active surveillance in men with localized prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Active Surveillance for Prostate Cancer: Past, Current, and Future Trends.', 'A vision for closing the evidence-practice gap in the management of low-grade prostate cancer.']"""

While PTEN loss of function hyperactivates PI3K signaling, combinatorial PI3K/AKT pathway and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has demonstrated limited anticancer efficacy in clinical trials. Here, we aimed to elucidate mechanism(s) of resistance to ADT/PI3K-AKT axis blockade, and to develop rational combinatorial strategies to effectively treat this molecular subset of mCRPC.  Experimental design:   Prostate-specific PTEN/p53-deficient genetically engineered mice (GEM) with established 150-200 mm3 tumors, as assessed by ultrasound, were treated with either ADT (degarelix), PI3K inhibitor (copanlisib), or anti-PD-1 antibody (aPD-1), as single agents or their combinations, and tumors were monitored by MRI and harvested for immune, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling, or ex vivo co-culture studies. Single-cell RNA sequencing on human mCRPC samples was performed using 10X Genomics platform.  Results:   Coclinical trials in PTEN/p53-deficient GEM revealed that recruitment of PD-1-expressing tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) thwarts ADT/PI3Ki combination-induced tumor control. The addition of aPD-1 to ADT/PI3Ki combination led to TAM-dependent approximately 3-fold increase in anticancer responses. Mechanistically, decreased lactate production from PI3Ki-treated tumor cells suppressed histone lactylation within TAM, resulting in their anticancer phagocytic activation, which was augmented by ADT/aPD-1 treatment and abrogated by feedback activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis in mCRPC patient biopsy samples revealed a direct correlation between high glycolytic activity and TAM phagocytosis suppression.  Conclusions:   Immunometabolic strategies that reverse lactate and PD-1-mediated TAM immunosuppression, in combination with ADT, warrant further investigation in patients with PTEN-deficient mCRPC.""","""['Kiranj Chaudagar', 'Hanna M Hieromnimon#', 'Rimpi Khurana#', 'Brian Labadie', 'Taghreed Hirz', 'Shenglin Mei', 'Raisa Hasan', 'Jordan Shafran', 'Anne Kelley', 'Eva Apostolov', 'Ghamdan Al-Eryani', 'Kate Harvey', 'Srikrishnan Rameshbabu', 'Mayme Loyd', 'Kaela Bynoe', 'Catherine Drovetsky', 'Ani Solanki', 'Erica Markiewicz', 'Marta Zamora', 'Xiaobing Fan', 'Stephan Schürer', 'Alex Swarbrick', 'David B Sykes', 'Akash Patnaik']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Suppression of tumor cell lactate-generating signaling pathways eradicates murine PTEN/p53-deficient aggressive-variant prostate cancer via macrophage phagocytosis.', 'Plasma Cell-Free DNA Profiling of PTEN-PI3K-AKT Pathway Aberrations in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'New treatment approaches for and ongoing trials in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'HDAC inhibition impedes epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and suppresses metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Lactate as Key Metabolite in Prostate Cancer Progression: What Are the Clinical Implications?', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).']"""

Prostate cancer screening is beneficial only to certain categories of men, making a rational screening approach necessary.  Aim:   This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) regarding prostate cancer screening among primary health care (PHC) providers in the Free State, South Africa.  Setting:   Selected district hospitals, local clinics and general practice rooms.  Methods:   This was a cross-sectional analytical survey. Participating nurses and community health workers (CHWs) were selected through stratified random sampling. All available medical doctors and clinical associates were approached to participate, totalling 548 participants. Relevant information was obtained from these PHC providers using self-administered questionnaires. Both descriptive and analytical statistics were computed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) Version 9. A p-value 0.05 was considered significant.  Results:   Most participants had poor knowledge (64.8%), neutral attitudes (58.6%) and poor practice (40.0%). Female PHC providers, lower cadre nurses and CHWs had lower mean knowledge scores. Not participating in prostate cancer-related continuing medical education was associated with poor knowledge (p 0.001), negative attitudes (p = 0.047) and poor practice (p 0.001).  Conclusion:   This study established appreciable KAP gaps relating to prostate cancer screening among PHC providers. Identified gaps should be addressed through the preferred teaching and learning strategies suggested by the participants.Contribution: This study establishes the need to address KAP gaps regarding prostate cancer screening among PHC providers; therefore necessitating the capacity-building roles of district family physicians.""","""['Matthew O A Benedict', 'Wilhelm J Steinberg', 'Frederik M Claassen', 'Nathaniel Mofolo', 'Cornel Van Rooyen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med""","""['Prostate cancer screening using prostate-specific antigen: The views of general and laboratory physicians.', 'Cancer related knowledge, attitude, and practice among community health care providers and health assistants in rural Bangladesh.', 'Knowledge, attitude and practice towards cervical cancer prevention among mothers of girls aged between 9 and 14\xa0years: a cross sectional survey in Zimbabwe.', 'Barriers to Prostate Cancer Screening by Men in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Integrated Review.', 'Enhancing public awareness and practice of prostate cancer screening among African men: A scoping review.']"""

Although enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect of magnetic nanomaterials could benefit from external magnetic field, it falls off rapidly with increased distance from magnet surface. Considering the deep location of prostate in pelvis, the improvement of EPR effect by external magnetic field is limited. In addition, apoptosis resistance and cGAS-STING pathway inhibition-related immunotherapy resistance are major obstacles to conventional therapy. Herein, the magnetic PEGylated manganese-zinc ferrite nanocrystals (PMZFNs) are designed. Instead of providing external magnet, micromagnets into tumor tissues are intratumorally implanted to actively attract and retain intravenously-injected PMZFNs. As a result, PMZFNs accumulate in prostate cancer with high efficacy, depending on the established internal magnetic field, which subsequently elicit potent ferroptosis and the activation of cGAS-STING pathway. Ferroptosis not only directly suppresses prostate cancer but also triggers burst release of cancer-associated antigens and consequently initiates ICD against prostate cancer, where activated cGAS-STING pathway further amplifies the efficacy of ICD by generating interferon-β. Collectively, the intratumorally implanted micromagnets confer a durable EPR effect of PMZFNs, which eventually achieve the synergetic tumoricidal efficacy with negligible systemic toxicity.""","""['Hui Wang', 'Yu Guan', 'Chun Li', 'Jia Chen', 'Shaoyu Yue', 'Jieying Qian', 'Bangshun Dai', 'Changqin Jiang', 'Chenghao Wen', 'Longping Wen', 'Chaozhao Liang', 'Yunjiao Zhang', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Small""","""['Immunogenic Cell Death Augmented by Manganese Zinc Sulfide Nanoparticles for Metastatic Melanoma Immunotherapy.', 'Potent STING activation stimulates immunogenic cell death to enhance antitumor immunity in neuroblastoma.', 'Multi-modal Mn-Zn ferrite nanocrystals for magnetically-induced cancer targeted hyperthermia: a comparison of passive and active targeting effects.', 'Immunogenic Cell Death and Role of Nanomaterials Serving as Therapeutic Vaccine for Personalized Cancer Immunotherapy.', 'Combination Cancer Immunotherapy of Nanoparticle-Based Immunogenic Cell Death Inducers and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors.', 'Recent advances of nanocrystals in cancer theranostics.']"""

The results were validated with respect to the prognostication of overall survival in patients with advanced-stage prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   A total of 78 patients who underwent [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy from January 2018 to December 2020 were retrospectively included in this study. [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET images, acquired prior to radionuclide therapy, were used for the analysis of thresholding algorithms. All PET images were first analyzed semi-automatically using a pre-evaluated, proprietary software solution as the baseline method. Subsequently, five histogram-based thresholding methods and two local adaptive thresholding methods that are well established in computer vision were applied to quantify molecular tumor volume. The resulting whole-body molecular tumor volumes were validated with respect to the prognostication of overall patient survival as well as their statistical correlation to the baseline methods and their performance on standardized phantom scans.  Results:   The whole-body PSMA-TVs, quantified using different thresholding methods, demonstrate a high positive correlation with the baseline methods. We observed the highest correlation with generalized histogram thresholding (GHT) (Pearson r (r), p value (p): r = 0.977, p < 0.001) and Sauvola thresholding (r = 0.974, p < 0.001) and the lowest correlation with Multiotsu (r = 0.877, p < 0.001) and Yen thresholding methods (r = 0.878, p < 0.001). The median survival time of all patients was 9.87 months (95% CI [9.3 to 10.13]). Stratification by median whole-body PSMA-TV resulted in a median survival time from 11.8 to 13.5 months for the patient group with lower tumor burden and 6.5 to 6.6 months for the patient group with higher tumor burden. The patient group with lower tumor burden had significantly higher probability of survival (p < 0.00625) in eight out of nine thresholding methods (Fig. 2); those methods were SUVmax50 (p = 0.0038), SUV ≥3 (p = 0.0034), Multiotsu (p = 0.0015), Yen (p = 0.0015), Niblack (p = 0.001), Sauvola (p = 0.0001), Otsu (p = 0.0053), and Li thresholding (p = 0.0053).  Conclusion:   Thresholding methods commonly used in computer vision are promising tools for the semiautomatic quantification of whole-body PSMA-TV in [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11-PET. The proposed algorithm-driven thresholding strategy is less arbitrary and less prone to biases than thresholding with predefined values, potentially improving the application of whole-body PSMA-TV as an imaging biomarker.""","""['Moon Kim', 'Robert Seifert', 'Jana Fragemann', 'David Kersting', 'Jacob Murray', 'Frederic Jonske', 'Kelsey L Pomykala', 'Jan Egger', 'Wolfgang P Fendler', 'Ken Herrmann', 'Jens Kleesiek']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['Early molecular imaging response assessment based on determination of total viable tumor burden in 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT independently predicts overall survival in 177LuLu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'qPSMA: Semiautomatic Software for Whole-Body Tumor Burden Assessment in Prostate Cancer Using 68Ga-PSMA11 PET/CT.', 'Determination of whole-body tumour burden on 68GaPSMA-11 PET/CT for response assessment of 177LuPSMA-617 radioligand therapy: a\xa0retrospective analysis of serum PSA level and imaging derived parameters before and after two cycles of therapy.', 'Semiautomatically Quantified Tumor Volume Using 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET as a Biomarker for Survival in Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'The Impact of PSMA PET/CT on Modern Prostate Cancer Management and Decision Making-The Urological Perspective.']"""

Materials and methods:   Men with mPCa undergoing local treatment by radical prostatectomy (RP), radiotherapy (RT) including beam radiation and brachytherapy or no local treatment identified from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2015). To evaluate local therapy impact on OS and CSS in relation to baseline characteristics, univariate and multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to predict the prognostic value of local therapy in OS and CSS.  Results:   A total of 902 (25.8%) patients received local treatment and 2598 (74.2%) patients did not receive local treatment in this study. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that there was significant difference in OS between patients underwent local treatment and patients without local treatment (P = .013) but not in CSS (P = .068). While multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that local treatment may not significantly improve OS(P = .724). In subgroup analysis, Among patients with prostate-specific antigent (PSA)<10ng/ml, local treatment could significantly improve OS and CSS (all P < .05). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that local treatment could be used as an independent prognostic factor to improve OS in mPCa patients with PSA<10ng/ml (P = .031). Another multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that patients with mPCa undergoing RP had better OS and CSS (all P < .05).  Conclusions:   Our results showed that local salvage therapy did not seem to be an independent prognostic factor in all mPCa patients, but we found that local therapy can show a better prognosis in patients with lower PSA levels. Compared with RT, patients who had experienced RP may have better prognosis.

The day 1 (30) seed arrangement was registered onto the day 0 (1) arrangement using a seed-only approach. Based on a 1:1 assignment of seeds via the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, seed-displacements were analyzed. Displacements were evaluated depending on strand-length and anatomical implant location. Resulting dosimetric effects were calculated.  Results:   Seed-displacements in the immediate post-implant phase (median displacements: 3.8 ± 3.6 mm) were stronger than in the time to post-plan CT (2.1 ± 2.6 mm) and enhanced along the superior-inferior direction. From day 0 to 1, strands containing one (7.3 ± 5.4 mm) or two (8.1 ± 5.8 mm) seeds showed larger displacements than strands of higher lengths (up to 4.2 ± 7.0 mm), whereas no length-dependency was found to day 30. Seeds implanted in base and apex tended to move towards the prostate midzone during both time periods. D90 (dose that 90% of prostate receives) was with variations of 2 ± 15 Gy more stable from day 1 to 30 than in the immediate post-implant phase (-18 ± 11 Gy).  Conclusion:   Seed-displacements in the immediate post-implant phase was enhanced compared to day 1-30. This may result from uncertainties in the gold-standard ultrasound-based treatment planning and implantation. Adaptive implantation workflows appear useful for ensuring high implant stability from the beginning.""","""['Andre Karius', 'Claudia Schweizer', 'Vratislav Strnad', 'Michael Lotter', 'Stephan Kreppner', 'Allison Lamrani', 'Rainer Fietkau', 'Christoph Bert']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiother Oncol""","""['Permanent LDR prostate brachytherapy: Comprehensive characterization of seed-dynamics within the prostate on a seed-only level.', 'Seed displacements after permanent brachytherapy for prostate cancer in dependence on the prostate level.', 'A comparative study of seed localization and dose calculation on pre- and post-implantation ultrasound and CT images for low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy.', 'Which patients benefit from post-implant CT dosimetry after real-time intraoperative planning for low dose rate prostate brachytherapy?

The final analysis confirmed improvement in OS and other long-term outcomes. We evaluated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) kinetics and the association between PSA decline and outcomes in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer from TITAN.  Patients and methods:   Patients received apalutamide (240 mg/day) or placebo plus ADT (1 : 1). This post hoc exploratory analysis evaluated PSA kinetics and decline in relation to rPFS (22.7 months' follow-up) and OS, time to PSA progression, and time to castration resistance (44.0 months' follow-up) in patients with or without confirmed PSA decline using a landmark analysis, the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   One thousand and fifty-two patients (apalutamide, 525; placebo, 527) were enrolled. Best confirmed PSA declines (≥50% or ≥90% from baseline or to ≤0.2 ng/ml) were achieved at any time during the study in 90%, 73%, and 68% of apalutamide-treated versus 55%, 29%, and 32% of placebo-treated patients, respectively.

Yet, it is unknown for men with at most one high-risk factor (ie, pT3/4 or prostatectomy [p] Gleason score 8-10) whether a PSA level exists above which initiating sRT is associated with increased all-cause mortality (ACM)-risk and was investigated.  Methods:   Using a multinational database of 25,551 patients with pT2-4N0 or NXM0 prostate cancer, multivariable Cox regression analysis evaluated whether an association with a significant increase in ACM-risk existed when sRT was delivered above a prespecified PSA level beginning at 0.10 ng/mL and in 0.05 increments up to 0.50 ng/mL versus at or below that level. The model was adjusted for age at and year of radical prostatectomy, established prostate cancer prognostic factors, institution, and the time-dependent use of androgen deprivation therapy.

In this research, sodium butyrate (Sb) is one of the effective anti-cancer therapeutics (also a potent survival factor for normal cells) that was used for prostate cancer suppression in the platform of modified chitosan (CS) nano-complex (polyethylene glycol (PEG)-folic acid (FA)-Sb-CS). Methods: Different analytical devices including Fourier transform infrared, dynamic light scattering, high-performance liquid chromatography, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy were applied for the characterization of synthetics. On the other hand, biomedical tests including cell viability assay, molecular and functional assay of apoptosis/autophagy pathways, and cell cycle arrest analysis were potentially implemented on human PC3 (folate receptor-negative prostate cancer) and DU145 (folate receptor-positive prostate cancer) and HFF-1 normal cell lines. Results: The quality of the syntheses was effectively verified, and the size range from 140 to 170 nm was determined for the PEG-CS-FA-Sb sample. Also, 75 ± 5% of drug entrapment efficiency with controlled drug release manner (Sb release of 54.21% and 74.04% for pHs 7.4 and 5.0) were determined for nano-complex. Based on MTT results, PEG-CS-FA-Sb has indicated 72.07% and 33.53% cell viability after 24 h of treatment with 9 mM on PC3 and DU145 cell lines, respectively, which is desirable anti-cancer performance. The apoptotic and autophagy genes overexpression was 15-fold (caspase9), 2.5-fold (BAX), 11-fold (ATG5), 2-fold (BECLIN1), and 3-fold (mTORC1) genes in DU145 cancer cells. More than 50% of cell cycle arrest and 45.05% of apoptosis were obtained for DU145 cancer cells after treatment with nano-complex. Conclusion: Hence, the synthesized Sb-loaded nano-complex could specifically suppress prostate cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis and autophagy in the molecular and cellular phases.""","""['Ali Zamanvaziri', 'Mahboobeh Meshkat', 'Soroush Alazmani', 'Sepideh Khaleghi', 'Mehrdad Hashemi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['Chitosan-coated Zn-metal-organic framework nanocomposites for effective targeted delivery of LNA-antisense miR-224 to colon tumor: in vitro studies.', 'Folate and Pegylated Aliphatic Polyester Nanoparticles for Targeted Anticancer Drug Delivery.', 'Nanoparticles of deoxycholic acid, polyethylene glycol and folic acid-modified chitosan for targeted delivery of doxorubicin.', 'Growth of human prostate cancer cells is significantly suppressed in vitro with sodium butyrate through apoptosis.', 'Design and Characterization of a Cancer-Targeted Drug Co-Delivery System Composed of Liposomes and Selenium Nanoparticles.']"""

The discriminatory ability of the nomogram was assessed according to the concordance index (C-index). A 5-fold cross-validation was repeated 2000 times to estimate the C-index, and the means of the estimated C-index for the training and validation sets were determined. A calculator based on this nomogram was then developed.  Results:   The median overall survival (OS) was 24.7 months.

However, some nonprostatic malignancies can also demonstrate 18 F-PSMA uptake, including primary lung cancer. 18 F-FDG PET/CT is widely employed in initial staging, response to therapy and follow-up assessment for lung cancer. Here we present an interesting case report on the different patterns of PSMA and FDG uptake between primary lung cancer and metastatic intrathoracic lymph node metastases in a patient with concurrent metastatic prostate cancer.  Case presentation:   A 70-year-old male underwent 18 F-FDG PET/CT and 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging due to suspicion primary lung cancer and prostate cancer. The patient eventually was diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with mediastinal lymph node metastases and prostate cancer with left iliac lymph node and multiple bone metastases. Interestingly, our imaging revealed different patterns of tumor uptake detected on 18 F-FDG and 18 F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in primary lung cancer and lymph node metastases. The primary lung lesion showed intense FDG uptake, and mild uptake with 18 F-PSMA-1007. Whereas the mediastinal lymph node metastases showed both intense FDG and PSMA uptake. The prostate lesion, left iliac lymph node, and multiple bone lesions showed significant PSMA uptake and negative FDG uptake.  Conclusion:   In this case, there was a homogeneity of 18 F-FDG intense uptake between LC and metastatic lymph nodes, but a heterogeneity in 18 F-PSMA-1007 uptake. It illustrated that these molecular probes reflect the diversity of tumor microenvironments, which may help us understand the differences of the tumor response to treatment.""","""['Yuan Hu', 'Peng Wang', 'Wenli Dai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Pulm Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Diagnostic accuracy of virtual 18F-FDG PET/CT bronchoscopy for the detection of lymph node metastases in non-small cell lung cancer patients.', 'Significance of dual-time-point 18F-FDG PET imaging in evaluation of hilar and mediastinal lymph node metastasis in non-small-cell lung cancer.', 'Fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT) for the detection of bone, lung, and lymph node metastases in rhabdomyosarcoma.', 'PSMA PET Scan Era: A Changing Paradigm PSMA PET and Lymph Node Dissection for Prostate Cancer Management.']"""

Trim28 inactivated NPp53T mice developed an inflammatory response and necrosis in prostate lumens. By conducting single-cell RNA sequencing, we found that NPp53T prostates had fewer luminal cells resembling proximal luminal lineage cells, which are cells with progenitor activity enriched in proximal prostates and prostate invagination tips in wild-type mice with analogous populations in human prostates. However, despite increased apoptosis and reduction of cells expressing proximal luminal cell markers, we found that NPp53T mouse prostates evolved and progressed to invasive prostate carcinoma with a shortened overall survival.

Moreover, to directly compare the survival advantage of RC between ACB vs. urothelial bladder cancer (UBC).  Materials and methods:   Non-metastatic muscle-invasive ACB and UBC patients were identified within Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER 2000-2018). All analyses were stratified between RC vs. no-RC, in either organ-confined (OC: T2N0M0) or non-organ-confined (NOC: T3-4N0M0 or TanyN1-3M0) stages. Propensity score matching (PSM), cumulative incidence plots, competing risks regression (CRR) analyses, and 3 months' landmark analyses were performed.  Results:   Overall, 1,005 ACB and 47,741 UBC patients were identified, of whom 475 (47%) and 19,499 (41%) were treated with RC, respectively. After PSM, comparison between RC vs. no-RC applied to 127 vs. 127 OC-ACB, 7,611 vs. 7,611 OC-UBC, 143 vs. 143 NOC-ACB, and 4,664 vs. 4,664 NOC-UBC patients. 36-month CSM rates in RC vs. no-RC patients were 14 vs. 44% in OC-ACB, 18 vs. 39% in OC-UBC, 49 vs. 66% in NOC-ACB, and 44 vs. 56% in NOC-UBC patients. In CRR analyses, the effect of RC on CSM yielded a hazard ratio of 0.37 in OC-ACB, of 0.45 in OC-UBC, of 0.65 in NOC-ACB and of 0.68 in NOC-UBC patients (all P values<0.001).

However, 50-65% of patients undergoing RC experience perioperative complications. The risk, severity and impact of these complications is associated with a patient's preoperative cardiorespiratory fitness, nutritional and smoking status and presence of anxiety and depression. There is emerging evidence supporting multimodal prehabilitation as a strategy to reduce the risk of complications and improve functional recovery after major cancer surgery. However, for bladder cancer the evidence is still limited. The aim of this study is to investigate the superiority of a multimodal prehabilitation programme versus standard-of-care in terms of reducing perioperative complications in patients with bladder cancer undergoing RC.  Methods and analysis:   This multicentre, open label, prospective, randomised controlled trial, will include 154 patients with bladder cancer undergoing RC. Patients are recruited from eight hospitals in The Netherlands and will be randomly (1:1) allocated to the intervention group receiving a structured multimodal prehabilitation programme of approximately 3-6 weeks, or to the control group receiving standard-of-care. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients who develop one or more grade ≥2 complications (according to the Clavien-Dindo classification) within 90 days of surgery. Secondary outcomes include cardiorespiratory fitness, length of hospital stay, health-related quality of life, tumour tissue biomarkers of hypoxia, immune cell infiltration and cost-effectiveness. Data collection will take place at baseline, before surgery and 4 and 12 weeks after surgery.

Materials and methods:   Using cancer death certification and population data from the World Health Organization and Eurostat databases for 1970-2018, we predicted numbers of deaths and age-standardized rates (ASRs) for 2023 for all cancers combined and the 10 most common cancer sites. We investigated the changes in trends over the observed period. The number of avoided deaths over the period 1989-2023 were estimated for all cancers as well as lung cancer.  Results:   We predicted 1 261 990 cancer deaths for 2023 in the EU-27, corresponding to ASRs of 123.8/100 000 men (-6.5% versus 2018) and 79.3 for women (-3.7%). Over 1989-2023, ∼5 862 600 cancer deaths were avoided in the EU-27 compared with peak rates in 1988. Most cancers displayed favorable predicted rates, with the exceptions of pancreatic cancer, which was stable in EU men (8.2/100 000) and rose by 3.4% in EU women (5.9/100 000), and female lung cancer, which, however, tends to level off (13.6/100 000). Steady declines are predicted for colorectal, breast, prostate, leukemia, stomach in both sexes, and male bladder cancers. The focus on lung cancer showed falls in mortality for all age groups in men. Female lung cancer mortality declined in the young (-35.8%, ASR: 0.8/100 000) and middle-aged (-7%, ASR: 31.2/100 000) but still increased by 10% in the elderly (age 65+ years).  Conclusions:   The advancements in tobacco control are reflected in favorable lung cancer trends, and should be pushed further.

Actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5 (ARPC5) has been validated as a critical regulator in several kinds of human tumors. However, whether ARPC5 is implicated in PCa progression remains largely unknown.  Methods:   PCa specimens and PCa cell lines were obtained for detecting gene expressions using western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). PCa cells transfected with ARPC5 shRNA or a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) overexpressed plasmids were harvested for assessing cell proliferation, migration and invasion by using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation and transwell assays, respectively. The interaction relationship between molecules was testified with chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase reporter assay. Xenograft mice model was conducted for confirming the role of ARPC5/ADAM17 axis in vivo.  Results:   Upregulated ARPC5 was observed in PCa tissues and cells, as well as forecasted poor prognosis of PCa patients. Depletion of ARPC5 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) was identified to be a transcriptional activator of ARPC5 via binding with its promoter region. Furthermore, ADAM17 served as a downstream effector of ARPC5. ADAM17 overexpression overturned ARPC5 knockdown-induced repressive impacts on PCa progression in vitro and in vivo.

All patients were stratified according to the D'Amico risk classification: low-risk 21%, favorable intermediate-risk 16%, unfavorable intermediate-risk 30.4%, and high-risk 32.6%. The dose prescription for high-risk patients was 72.8 Gy to the prostate (planning tumor volume-PTV1), 61.6 Gy to the seminal vesicles (PTV2), and 50.4 Gy to the pelvic lymph nodes (PTV3) in 28 fractions; for low- and intermediate-risk patients 70 Gy for PTV1, 56 Gy for PTV2, and 50.4 Gy for PTV3 in 28 fractions. Image-guided radiation therapy was performed daily in all patients by mega-voltage computed tomography. Forty-one percent of patients received androgen deprivation therapy (ADT).

This study aimed to evaluate the long-term outcomes of low-dose-rate brachytherapy (LDR-BT) for localized prostate cancer in Japanese patients and identify factors associated with late recurrence after treatment.  Patients and methods:   This single-center, cohort study included patients who underwent LDR-BT at the Tokushima University Hospital in Japan between July 2004 and January 2015; 418 patients, who were followed-up at least 7 years after LDR-BT, were included in the study. Biochemical progression free survival (bPFS) was defined according to the Phoenix definition (nadir PSA+2 ng/ml) and bPFS and cancer specific survival (CSS) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard regression models.  Results:   Approximately half of the patients with PSA >0.5 ng/ml at 5 years after LDR-BT had a recurrence within the next 2 years.

Patients and methods:   Retrospectively, the enrolled patients underwent prostate MRI and had PSA levels between 4 and 10 ng/ml. The PV was measured with both the ellipsoid volume formula (PVe) and the segmentation method (PVs). The transitional zone volume (TZV) was measured with the segmentation method. The PSADe, PSADs, and PSAD_TZV were calculated. Bland-Altman plots were used to compare the agreements. ROC curve analysis was used to compare the diagnostic accuracies to predict PCa. The results were also compared between the PCa and the no-PCa groups, and among tumors with different locations and different Gleason scores (GS).  Results:   Seventy-six of the 117 enrolled patients were classified into the PCa group. There were high agreements between PVs and PVe as well as between PSADs and PSADe, while several outliers were mainly due to post-transurethral resection of the prostate changes and irregular hyperplastic nodules. The diagnostic accuracy of PSADe (AUC: 0.732) was slightly higher than that of PSADs (AUC: 0.729) and PSAD_TZV (AUC: 0.715). The PSADe and PSADs were not different among different tumor locations but were higher in GS ≥7 lesions (both p=0.006).

However, monoolein and phytantriol, as two widely used LLC-forming materials, may give rise to tissue cytotoxicity and undesired immunological responses, which may hinder the wide application of this technology. In this study, we opted for two ingredients, phosphatidylcholine and α-tocopherol, as carriers on account of their nature-obtainable and biocompatible qualities. By changing the ratios between them, we conducted research on crystalline types, nanosized structures, viscoelastic differences, characteristics of releasing behaviors, and in vivo safety. To fully exploit this in situ LLC platform with both injectability and sprayability, we focused on the treatment of both hormone-sensitive (HSPC) and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). For HSPC, we found that spraying leuprolide and a cabazitaxel-loaded LLC platform on the tumor bed after resection greatly reduced tumor metastatic rate and prolonged the survival time. Besides, for CRPC, our results demonstrated that although leuprolide (a kind of drug for castration) alone could hardly limit the progression of CRPC with low MHC-I expression, its combination with cabazitaxel in our LLC platform achieved a significantly better tumor-inhibiting and anti-recurrent efficacy than single cabazitaxel-loaded LLC platform, owing to enhanced CD4+ T cell infiltration in tumors and immune-potentiating cytokines.

There is a critical need to find new multiple myeloma vulnerabilities and therapeutic avenues. Herein, we identified and explored a novel multiple myeloma target: the fatty acid binding protein (FABP) family. In our work, myeloma cells were treated with FABP inhibitors (BMS3094013 and SBFI-26) and examined in vivo and in vitro for cell cycle state, proliferation, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, cellular metabolism (oxygen consumption rates and fatty acid oxidation), and DNA methylation properties. Myeloma cell responses to BMS309403, SBFI-26, or both, were also assessed with RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and proteomic analysis, and confirmed with western blotting and qRT-PCR. Myeloma cell dependency on FABPs was assessed using the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap). Finally, MM patient datasets (CoMMpass and GEO) were mined for FABP expression correlations with clinical outcomes. We found that myeloma cells treated with FABPi or with FABP5 knockout (generated via CRISPR/Cas9 editing) exhibited diminished proliferation, increased apoptosis, and metabolic changes in vitro. FABPi had mixed results in vivo, in two pre-clinical MM mouse models, suggesting optimization of in vivo delivery, dosing, or type of FABP inhibitors will be needed before clinical applicability. FABPi negatively impacted mitochondrial respiration and reduced expression of MYC and other key signaling pathways in MM cells in vitro. Clinical data demonstrated worse overall and progression-free survival in patients with high FABP5 expression in tumor cells. Overall, this study establishes the FABP family as a potentially new target in multiple myeloma. In MM cells, FABPs have a multitude of actions and cellular roles that result in the support of myeloma progression.

This revealed that ARF3 GTPase regulates the modality of invasion, acting as a switch between leader cell-led chains of invasion or collective sheet movement. Functionally, the ability of ARF3 to control invasion modality is dependent on association and subsequent control of turnover of N-cadherin. In vivo, ARF3 levels acted as a rheostat for metastasis from intraprostatic tumor transplants and ARF3/N-cadherin expression can be used to identify prostate cancer patients with metastatic, poor-outcome disease.

Methods:   We performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to assess the causal effect of gut microbiota on cancer risk. Five common cancers, including breast, endometrial, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer as well as their subtypes (sample sizes ranging from 27,209 to 228,951) were included as the outcomes. Genetic information for gut microbiota was obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) comprising 18,340 participants. In univariable MR (UVMR) analysis, the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method was conducted as the primary method, with the robust adjusted profile scores, weighted median, and MR Egger used as supplementary methods for causal inference. Sensitivity analyses including the Cochran Q test, Egger intercept test, and leave-one-out analysis were performed to verify the robustness of the MR results. Multivariable MR (MVMR) was performed to evaluate the direct causal effects of gut microbiota on the risk of cancers.  Results:   UVMR detected a higher abundance of genus Sellimonas predicted a higher risk of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (OR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.05-1.14, p = 2.01 × 10-5 ), and a higher abundance of class Alphaproteobacteria was associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer (OR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.93, p = 1.11 × 10-3 ). Sensitivity analysis found little evidence of bias in the current study. MVMR further confirmed that genus Sellimonas exerted a direct effect on breast cancer, while the effect of class Alphaproteobacteria on prostate cancer was driven by the common risk factors of prostate cancer.

Their baseline average eGFR was 73.8 ± 19.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 , and 18.3% had rapid renal function decline (≥5 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year). Rapid renal function decline was positively related to age, baseline eGFR, proteinuria, hypertension, waist circumferences, high log triglyceride levels, and diabetes mellitus (DM) history. In Cox proportional hazard models, participants with rapid eGFR decline had an increased risk of cancer mortality [hazard ratio (95% CI): 1.97 (1.73, 2.24); p < 0.001] compared to those without rapid eGFR decline. In the analysis of site-specific cancer mortality risk, rapid eGFR decline was associated with six site-specific cancer mortality, namely gastrointestinal tract, hepatobiliary, lung, prostate, urinary tract, and hematological malignancies.  Conclusions:   Elderly individuals with rapid kidney function decline had higher cancer mortality risks.

The purpose of our study was to use a multiplexed immunohistochemical (mIHC) approach to investigate the infiltration of immune cells in PCa tissue after eight weeks of ADT and/or RT with 10 Gy.  Methods:   From a cohort of 48 patients divided into two treatment arms, we obtained biopsies before and after treatment and used a mIHC method with multispectral imaging to analyze the infiltration of immune cells in tumor stroma and tumor epithelium, focusing on areas with high infiltration.  Results:   Tumor stroma showed a significantly higher infiltration of immune cells compared to tumor epithelium. The most prominent immune cells were CD20+ B-lymphocytes, followed by CD68+ macrophages, CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, FOXP3+ regulatory T-cells (Tregs), and T-bet+ Th1-cells. Neoadjuvant ADT followed by RT significantly increased the infiltration of all five immune cells. Numbers of Th1-cells and Tregs significantly increased after single treatment with ADT or RT. In addition, ADT alone increased the number of cytotoxic T-cells and RT increased the number of B-cells.  Conclusions:   Neoadjuvant ADT in combination with RT results in a higher inflammatory response compared to RT or ADT alone. The mIHC method may be a useful tool for investigating infiltrating immune cells in PCa biopsies to understand how immunotherapeutic approaches can be combined with current PCa therapies.""","""['Ann Erlandsson', 'Marie Lundholm', 'Johan Watz', 'Anders Bergh', 'Elitsa Petrova', 'Farhood Alamdari', 'Thomas Helleday', 'Sabina Davidsson', 'Ove Andren', 'Firas Tarish']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol""","""['Androgen deprivation therapy in combination with radiotherapy for high-risk clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Large institutional variations in use of androgen deprivation therapy with definitive radiotherapy in a population-based cohort of men with intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer.', 'Androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer: A randomised phase III trial.', 'The impact of dose-escalated radiotherapy plus androgen deprivation for prostate cancer using 2 linked nomograms.', 'Androgen-deprivation therapy alone versus combined with radiation therapy or chemotherapy for nonlocalized prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The effects of increasing concentrations of aqueous and methanolic extracts on human colorectal cancer HT-29 and HCT116 cell lines and human prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines were examined on cell proliferation using MTT assay and cell cycle analysis. The induction of apoptosis was also assessed by determining protein expression of caspase-3 and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage by western blot. The methanolic extract of C. europaea exerted significant antiproliferative effects on HT-29 (IC50 values 73 µg/ml), HCT116 (IC50 values 67 µg/ml), PC3 (IC50 values 63 µg/ml) and DU145 cells (IC50 values 65 µg/ml) after 48 hr treatment.

Additionally, cardiovascular risk has been shown to increase following exposure to certain treatments for advanced prostate cancer. There is conflicting evidence on risk of overall and specific cardiovascular outcomes among men treated for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We, therefore, sought to compare incidence of serious cardiovascular events among CRPC patients treated with abiraterone acetate plus predniso(lo)ne (AAP) and enzalutamide (ENZ), the two most widely used CRPC therapies.  Methods:   Using US administrative claims data, we selected CRPC patients newly exposed to either treatment after August 31, 2012, with prior androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We assessed incidence of hospitalization for heart failure (HHF), ischemic stroke, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during the period 30-days after AAP or ENZ initiation to discontinuation, outcome occurrence, death, or disenrollment. We matched treatment groups on propensity-scores (PSs) to control for observed confounding to estimate the average treatment effect among the treated (AAP) using conditional Cox proportional hazards models. To account for residual bias, we calibrated our estimates against a distribution of effect estimates from 124 negative-control outcomes.  Results:   The HHF analysis included 2322 (45.1%) AAP initiators and 2827 (54.9%) ENZ initiators. In this analysis, the median follow-up times among AAP and ENZ initiators (after PS matching) were 144 and 122 days, respectively. The empirically calibrated hazard ratio (HR) estimate for HHF was 2.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32, 4.94). Corresponding HRs for AMI and ischemic stroke were 1.94 (95% CI: 0.90, 4.18) and 1.25 (95% CI: 0.54, 2.85), respectively.  Conclusions:   Our study sought to quantify risk of HHF, AMI and ischemic stroke among CRPC patients initiating AAP relative to ENZ within a national administrative claims database. Increased risk for HHF among AAP compared to ENZ users was observed. The difference in myocardial infarction did not attain statistical significance after controlling for residual bias, and no differences were noted in ischemic stroke between the two treatments. These findings confirm labeled warnings and precautions for AAP for HHF and contribute to the comparative real-world evidence on AAP relative to ENZ.""","""['Mitchell M Conover', 'James Weaver', 'Bo Fan', 'Gerhard Leitz', 'Ute Richarz', 'Qing Li', 'Dina Gifkins']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Comparative Cardiovascular Safety of Novel Hormonal Agents in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Using Real-World Data.', 'Optimal treatment sequencing of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone and enzalutamide in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Pretreatment Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) Predicts Prognosis for Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Underwent Enzalutamide.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

The major secondary objectives are to determine the additive value of the combined approach of SB + MR-TB + PET-TB (PET/MR-TB) for detecting clinically significant PCA (csPCA) compared to SOC; to determine sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy of imaging techniques, respective imaging classification systems, and each biopsy method; and to compare preoperatively defined tumor burden and biomarker expression and pathological tumor extent in prostate specimens.  Methods:   The DEPROMP study is a prospective, open-label, interventional investigator-initiated trial. Risk stratification and management plans after PET/MR-TB are conducted randomized and blinded by different evaluation teams of experienced urologists based on histopathological analysis and imaging information: one including all results of the PET/MR-TB and one excluding the additional information gained by PSMA-PET/CT guided biopsy. The power calculation was centered on pilot data, and we will recruit up to 230 biopsy-naïve men who will undergo PET/MR-TB for suspected PCA. Conduct and reporting of MRI and PSMA-PET/CT will be performed in a blinded fashion.  Discussion:   The DEPROMP Trial will be the first to evaluate the clinically relevant effects of the use of PSMA-PET/CT in patients with suspected PCA compared to current SOC. The study will provide prospective data to determine the diagnostic yields of additional PET-TB in men with suspected PCA and the impact on treatment plans in terms of intra- and intermodal changes. The results will allow a comparative analysis of risk stratification by each biopsy method, including a performance analysis of the corresponding rating systems.

When oligometastatic CRPC with only bone metastases progresses after targeted therapy, it tends to progress as multiple bone metastases. The progression of oligometastatic CRPC after targeted therapy may be due in part to the presence of micrometastatic lesions that, though undetected on imaging, were present prior to targeted therapy. Thus the systemic treatment of micrometastases in combination with targeted therapy for progressive sites is expected to enhance the therapeutic effect. Radium-223 dichloride (radium-223) is a radiopharmaceutical that selectively binds to sites of increased bone turnover and inhibits the growth of adjacent tumor cells by emitting alpha rays. Therefore, for oligometastatic CRPC with only bone metastases, radium-223 may enhance the therapeutic effect of radiotherapy for active metastases.  Methods:   This phase II, randomized trial of Metastasis-Directed therapy with ALpha emitter radium-223 in men with oligometastatic CRPC (MEDAL) is designed to assess the utility of radium-223 in combination with metastasis-directed radiotherapy in patients with oligometastatic CRPC confined to bone. In this trial, patients with oligometastatic CRPC with three or fewer bone metastases on whole-body MRI with diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive radiotherapy for active metastases plus radium-223 or radiotherapy for active metastases alone. The prior use of androgen receptor axis-targeted therapy and prostate-specific antigen doubling time will be used as allocation factors. The primary endpoint will be radiological progression-free survival against progression of bone metastases on WB-DWI.  Discussion:   This will be the first randomized trial to evaluate the effect of radium-223 in combination with targeted therapy in oligometastatic CRPC patients. The combination of targeted therapy for macroscopic metastases with radiopharmaceuticals targeting micrometastasis is expected to be a promising new therapeutic strategy for patients with oligometastatic CRPC confined to bone.

The present study was designed to establish a murine model of ADT with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist leuprolide and to investigate its effects on metabolism and cardiac function. We also examined the potential cardioprotective role of sildenafil (inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5) under chronic ADT. Middle-aged male C57BL/6J mice received a 12-wk subcutaneous infusion via osmotic minipumps containing either saline or 18 mg/4 wk leuprolide with or without 1.3 mg/4 wk sildenafil cotreatment. Compared with saline controls, leuprolide treatment significantly reduced prostate weight and serum testosterone levels, confirming chemical castration in these mice. The ADT-induced chemical castration was not affected by sildenafil. Leuprolide significantly increased the weight of abdominal fat after 12-wk treatment without a change in total body weight, and sildenafil did not block the proadipogenic effect of leuprolide. No signs of left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction were observed throughout the leuprolide treatment period. Interestingly, leuprolide treatment significantly elevated serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTn-I), a biomarker of cardiac injury, and sildenafil did not abolish this effect. We conclude that long-term ADT with leuprolide increases abdominal adiposity and cardiac injury biomarker without cardiac contractile dysfunction. Sildenafil did not prevent ADT-associated adverse changes.""","""['Lei Xi', 'Donatas Kraskauskas', 'Sakthivel Muniyan', 'Surinder K Batra', 'Rakesh C Kukreja']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol""","""['Advances with androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'GnRH antagonist associates with less adiposity and reduced characteristics of metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis compared with orchiectomy and GnRH agonist in a preclinical mouse model.', 'A comparative study on the efficacies of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and GnRH antagonist in neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy combined with transperineal prostate brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer.', 'Cardiovascular risks and toxicity - The Achilles heel of androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer patients.', 'Differences in Hypercholesterolemia and Atherogenesis Induced by Common Androgen Deprivation Therapies in Male Mice.', 'Review of Cardiovascular Risk of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and the Influence of Race in Men with Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 were prepared, and labelling efficiency and radiochemical purity were determined. A HepG2 human HCC subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was established. After intravenous injection of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 or [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 (37 MBq) into the mouse model, single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was performed. Biodistribution studies were conducted to verify targeting specificity and pharmacokinetics. In the radioligand therapy study, mice were randomized into 4 groups: 37 MBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, 18.5 MBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, 7.4 MBq [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617, and saline (control). A single-dose administration was applied at the beginning of therapy studies. Tumor volume, body weight, and survival were monitored every 2 days. After the end of therapy, mice were euthanized. Tumors were then weighed, and systemic toxicity was evaluated via blood testing and histological examination of healthy organs.  Results:   [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 were successfully prepared with high purity and stability. SPECT/CT and biodistribution showed that tumor uptake was higher and persisted longer for [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 compared with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was rapidly cleared from the blood, while [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 persisted for significantly longer. In radioligand therapy studies, tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the 37 MBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, 18.5 MBq [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, and 7.4 MBq [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 groups compared to the saline group.

Conclusions:   Radioligand therapy using [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 and [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time in PSMA-positive HCC xenograft mice without obvious toxicity.

Following international developments, the domain ""sexuality"" of the EPIC-26 (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite 26) is increasingly used in Germany.  Objective:   The aim of this work is to create a practicable comparison of the domain ""sexuality"" of the EPIC-26 with the IIEF‑5 for treatment in Germany. This is particularly necessary for the evaluation of historical patient collectives.  Materials and methods:   For the evaluation, 2123 patients with prostate cancer confirmed by biopsy from 2014-2017 who completed both the IIEF‑5 and the EPIC-26 were considered. Linear regression analyses are calculated to convert IIEF‑5 sum scores to EPIC-26 sexuality domain scores.  Results:   The correlation between IIEF‑5 and the EPIC-26 domain score ""sexuality"" was 0.74, suggesting a high degree of content convergence between the constructs measured. While the standard error of the predicted values is relatively small, the prediction intervals are very wide. For example, for the critical IIEF‑5 value of 22, the predicted value is 78.88 with a 95% prediction interval of 55.09 to 102.66.  Conclusion:   IIEF‑5 and the Sexuality scale of the EPIC-26 measure a similar construct. The analysis shows that conversion of individual values is associated with great uncertainty. However, at the group level, the observed EPIC-26 ""sexuality"" score could be predicted quite accurately.

LSD1 targets histone and nonhistone proteins and can function as a transcriptional corepressor or coactivator. LSD1 has been reported to act as a coactivator of androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer and to regulate the AR cistrome via demethylation of its pioneer factor FOXA1. A deeper understanding of the key oncogenic programs targeted by LSD1 could help stratify prostate cancer patients for treatment with LSD1 inhibitors, which are currently under clinical investigation. In this study, we performed transcriptomic profiling in an array of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) xenograft models that are sensitive to LSD1 inhibitor treatment. Impaired tumor growth by LSD1 inhibition was attributed to significantly decreased MYC signaling, and MYC was found to be a consistent target of LSD1. Moreover, LSD1 formed a network with BRD4 and FOXA1 and was enriched at super-enhancer regions exhibiting liquid-liquid phase separation. Combining LSD1 inhibitors with BET inhibitors exhibited strong synergy in disrupting the activities of multiple drivers in CRPC, thereby inducing significant growth repression of tumors. Importantly, the combination treatment showed superior effects than either inhibitor alone in disrupting a subset of newly identified CRPC-specific super-enhancers. These results provide mechanistic and therapeutic insights for cotargeting two key epigenetic factors and could be rapidly translated in the clinic for CRPC patients.  Significance:   LSD1 drives prostate cancer progression by activating super-enhancer-mediated oncogenic programs, which can be targeted with the combination of LSD1 and BRD4 inhibitors to suppress the growth of CRPC.""","""['Muqing Li#', 'Mingyu Liu#', 'Wanting Han', 'Zifeng Wang', 'Dong Han', 'Susan Patalano', 'Jill A Macoska', 'Steven P Balk', 'Housheng Hansen He', 'Eva Corey', 'Shuai Gao', 'Changmeng Cai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res""","""['Inhibition of LSD1 by Pargyline inhibited process of EMT and delayed progression of prostate cancer in\xa0vivo.', 'The combined effect of epigenetic inhibitors for LSD1 and BRD4 alters prostate cancer growth and invasion.', 'Reversible lysine-specific demethylase 1 antagonist HCI-2509 inhibits growth and decreases c-MYC in castration- and docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'The heterogeneity of prostate cancers lacking AR activity will require diverse treatment approaches.', 'Exploring anti-androgen therapies in hormone dependent prostate cancer and new therapeutic routes for castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Editorial: Interplay between epigenetic modifiers and transcription factors in driving cancer progression.']"""

Phosphorylation studies excluded HSP70-1 as a substrate or activity modulator of CK2, suggesting a CK2 activity independent interaction of HSP70-1 with CK2β. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in three different cancer cell lines confirmed the interaction of HSP70-1 with CK2β in vivo.

The prostate epithelium was recently shown to express megalin, an endocytic receptor that internalizes circulating globulin-bound hormones, which suggests regulation of intracellular prostate hormone levels. This contrasts with passive diffusion of hormones that is posited by the free hormone hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that megalin imports testosterone bound to sex hormone-binding globulin into prostate cells. Prostatic loss of Lrp2 (megalin) in a mouse model resulted in reduced prostate testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels. Megalin expression was regulated and suppressed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) in cell lines, patient-derived prostate epithelial cells, and prostate tissue explants. In patients, the relationships between hormones support this regulatory mechanism, as prostatic DHT levels are higher in African American men and are inversely correlated with serum 25D status. Megalin levels are reduced in localized prostate cancer by Gleason grade. Our findings suggest that the free hormone hypothesis should be revisited for testosterone and highlight the impact of vitamin D deficiency on prostate androgen levels, which is a known driver of prostate cancer. Thus, we revealed a mechanistic link between vitamin D and prostate cancer disparities observed in African Americans.

Objective:   To determine the consensus of a Dutch multidisciplinary expert panel on the indication and application of germline and tumour genetic testing in PCa.  Design setting and participants:   The panel consisted of 39 specialists involved in PCa management. We used a modified Delphi method consisting of two voting rounds and a virtual consensus meeting.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Consensus was reached if ≥75% of the panellists chose the same option. Appropriateness was assessed by the RAND/UCLA appropriateness method.  Results and limitations:   Of the multiple-choice questions, 44% reached consensus. For men without PCa having a relevant family history (familial PCa/BRCA-related hereditary cancer), follow-up by prostate-specific antigen was considered appropriate. For patients with low-risk localised PCa and a family history of PCa, active surveillance was considered appropriate, except in case of the patient being a BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant carrier. Germline and tumour genetic testing should not be done for nonmetastatic hormone-sensitive PCa in the absence of a relevant family history of cancer. Tumour genetic testing was deemed most appropriate for the identification of actionable variants, with uncertainty for germline testing. For tumour genetic testing in metastatic castration-resistant PCa, consensus was not reached for the timing and panel composition. The principal limitations are as follows: (1) a number of topics discussed lack scientific evidence, and therefore the recommendations are partly opinion based, and (2) there was a small number of experts per discipline.  Conclusions:   The outcomes of this Dutch consensus meeting may provide further guidance on genetic counselling and molecular testing related to PCa.

We asked whether the tumor stroma in surgically treated localized prostate cancer lesions positive or negative with MRI are different in their cellular and molecular properties, and whether the differences are reflected to the clinical course of the disease. We profiled the stromal and immune cell composition of MRI-classified tumor lesions by applying multiplexed fluorescence IHC (mfIHC) and automated image analysis in a clinical cohort of 343 patients (cohort I). We compared stromal variables between MRI-visible lesions, invisible lesions, and benign tissue and assessed the predictive significance for biochemical recurrence (BCR) and disease-specific survival (DSS) using Cox regression and log-rank analysis. Subsequently, we carried out a prognostic validation of the identified biomarkers in a population-based cohort of 319 patients (cohort II). MRI true-positive lesions are different from benign tissue and MRI false-negative lesions in their stromal composition. CD163+ cells (macrophages) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP)+ cells were more abundant in MRI true-positive than in MRI false-negative lesions or benign areas. In MRI true-visible lesions, a high proportion of stromal FAP+ cells was associated with PTEN status and increased immune infiltration (CD8+, CD163+), and predicted elevated risk for BCR.

Previous research has revealed H. spicatum essential oil (HSEO) to exhibit anti-tumor activity, although the mechanism of action is still unknown. Therefore, the current study was designed to carry out a comprehensive characterization of HSEO and evaluate the chemotherapeutic potential of HSEO against cancerous cells. The volatile constituents of HSEO was determined by one-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GCxGC-TOFMS). In total, 193 phytocompounds could be detected, out of which 140 were identified for the first time. The major phytoconstituents detected by GCxGC-TOFMS were β-pinene (10.94%), eucalyptol (6.45%), sabinene (5.48%) and trans-isolimonene (5.00%). GCxGC-TOFMS analysis showed two and half fold increase in the constituents over GC-TOFMS due to better chromatographic separation of constituents in the 2nd dimensional column. HSEO was tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against cancerous (PC-3, HCT-116 and A-549) and normal (3T3-L1) cell, with HSEO being most selective for prostate cancer cell (PC-3) over non-tumorigenic fibroblast (3T3-L1) cell. HSEO treatment inhibited the colony formation ability of PC-3 cells. HSEO treatment caused apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest at G2/M and S phase in PC-3 cells. HSEO induced apoptosis via intracellular ROS accumulation, mitochondria depolarization and increased caspase-3, 8, and 9 levels in PC-3 cells. Additionally, HSEO treatment led to a decrease of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL and increase of Bax and Bak protein levels. Overall, results from this study highlighted the anticancer potential of H. spicatum essential oil, which could be considered as a new agent for treating prostate cancer.""","""['Asit Ray', 'Ayushman Gadnayak', 'Sudipta Jena', 'Ambika Sahoo', 'Jeetendranath Patnaik', 'Pratap Chandra Panda', 'Sanghamitra Nayak']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Heliyon""","""['Combinational Inhibitory Action of Hedychium spicatum L.

Methods BMSCs from BALB/c nude mice were isolated and cultured. BMSCs were infected with lentiviral plasmids loaded with ANXA2. Exosomes were isolated and then added to treat THP-1 macrophages. ELISA was used to detect the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and IL-10 in the cell supernatant culture fluid; After co-culturing the exosomes-treated macrophages and prostate cancer cells, CCK-8 assay was used to detect the cell proliferation activity. Also, TranswellTM chamber were used to detect the cell invasion and migration. A nude mouse xenograft model of prostate cancer was constructed by injecting PC-3 human prostate cancer cells, the modeled nude mice were randomly divided into a control group and an experimental group, with 8 mice in each group. The nude mice in experimental group were injected with 1 mL of Exo-ANXA2 through the tail vein, while the control group was injected with the same amount of PBS, on days 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 after injection. Then the tumor volume was measured and calculated with vernier calipers. The nude mice were sacrificed at 21 days with their the tumor mass measured. The immunohistochemical staining method was used to detect the expression of antigen KI-67 (ki67) and CD163 expression in tumor tissue. Results The cells isolated from bone marrow showed high expression of CD90 and CD44 on the surface, and low expression of CD34 and CD45, and had strong osteogenic adipogenic differentiation ability, indicating that BMSCs were successfully obtained. After infection with the lentiviral plasmid carrying ANXA2, a strong green fluorescent protein expression in BMSCs, and Exo-ANXA2 was isolated. After Exo-ANXA2 treatment, the levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in THP-1 cells increased significantly, while the levels of IL-10 and IL-13 decreased significantly. Exo-ANXA2 treatment of macrophages significantly inhibited Exo-ANXA2 and promoted the proliferation, invasion and migration of PC-3 cells. After injecting Exo-ANXA2 into nude mice with prostate cancer cells transplantation, the tumor tissue volume of nude mice was significantly reduced on the 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, 18th, and 21st days, and the tumor mass of nude mice was also significantly reduced on the 21st day. In addition, the positive expression rates of ki67 and CD163 in tumor tissues were significantly reduced.

The aim of this work is to compare between PI-RADS 3-5 and PI-RADS 4-5 as a threshold for targeted prostatic biopsy.  Methods:   This is a prospective clinical study that included 40 biopsy-naïve patients referred for prostate biopsy. Patients underwent prebiopsy multi-parametric (mp-MRI), followed by 12-core transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic biopsy and cognitive MRI/TRUS fusion targeted biopsy from each detected lesion. The primary endpoint was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the PI-RAD 3-4 versus PI-RADS 4-5 lesion by mpMRI for prostate cancer detection in biopsy-naive men.  Results:   The overall prostate cancer detection rate and the clinically significant cancer detection rate were 42.5% and 35%, respectively.

Exploiting in vitro and in vivo human and murine PCa models and the multistage transgenic TRAMP model of PCa we show that RSL3 induces ferroptosis in PCa cells and demonstrate for the first time that iron supplementation significantly increases the effect of RSL3 triggering lipid peroxidation, enhanced intracellular stress and leading to cancer cell death. Moreover, the combination with the second generation anti-androgen drug enzalutamide potentiates the effect of the RSL3 + iron combination leading to superior inhibition of PCa and preventing the onset of CRPC in the TRAMP mouse model.

Objective:   To discover common genetic variants contributing to the risk of PCa in men of African ancestry.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a meta-analysis of ten genome-wide association studies consisting of 19378 cases and 61620 controls of African ancestry.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Common genotyped and imputed variants were tested for their association with PCa risk. Novel susceptibility loci were identified and incorporated into a multiancestry polygenic risk score (PRS). The PRS was evaluated for associations with PCa risk and disease aggressiveness.  Results and limitations:   Nine novel susceptibility loci for PCa were identified, of which seven were only found or substantially more common in men of African ancestry, including an African-specific stop-gain variant in the prostate-specific gene anoctamin 7 (ANO7). A multiancestry PRS of 278 risk variants conferred strong associations with PCa risk in African ancestry studies (odds ratios [ORs] >3 and >5 for men in the top PRS decile and percentile, respectively). More importantly, compared with men in the 40-60% PRS category, men in the top PRS decile had a significantly higher risk of aggressive PCa (OR = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.10-1.38, p = 4.4 × 10-4).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates the importance of large-scale genetic studies in men of African ancestry for a better understanding of PCa susceptibility in this high-risk population and suggests a potential clinical utility of PRS in differentiating between the risks of developing aggressive and nonaggressive disease in men of African ancestry.  Patient summary:   In this large genetic study in men of African ancestry, we discovered nine novel prostate cancer (PCa) risk variants. We also showed that a multiancestry polygenic risk score was effective in stratifying PCa risk, and was able to differentiate risk of aggressive and nonaggressive disease.""","""['Fei Chen', 'Ravi K Madduri', 'Alex A Rodriguez', 'Burcu F Darst', 'Alisha Chou', 'Xin Sheng', 'Anqi Wang', 'Jiayi Shen', 'Edward J Saunders', 'Suhn K Rhie', 'Jeannette T Bensen', 'Sue A Ingles', 'Rick A Kittles', 'Sara S Strom', 'Benjamin A Rybicki', 'Barbara Nemesure', 'William B Isaacs', 'Janet L Stanford', 'Wei Zheng', 'Maureen Sanderson', 'Esther M John', 'Jong Y Park', 'Jianfeng Xu', 'Ying Wang', 'Sonja I Berndt', 'Chad D Huff', 'Edward D Yeboah', 'Yao Tettey', 'Joseph Lachance', 'Wei Tang', 'Christopher T Rentsch', 'Kelly Cho', 'Benjamin H Mcmahon', 'Richard B Biritwum', 'Andrew A Adjei', 'Evelyn Tay', 'Ann Truelove', 'Shelley Niwa', 'Thomas A Sellers', 'Kosj Yamoah', 'Adam B Murphy', 'Dana C Crawford', 'Alpa V Patel', 'William S Bush', 'Melinda C Aldrich', 'Olivier Cussenot', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Jennifer Cullen', 'Christine M Neslund-Dudas', 'Mariana C Stern', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Koveela Govindasami', 'Michael B Cook', 'Anand P Chokkalingam', 'Ann W Hsing', 'Phyllis J Goodman', 'Thomas J Hoffmann', 'Bettina F Drake', 'Jennifer J Hu', 'Jacob M Keaton', 'Jacklyn N Hellwege', 'Peter E Clark', 'Mohamed Jalloh', 'Serigne M Gueye', 'Lamine Niang', 'Olufemi Ogunbiyi', 'Michael O Idowu', 'Olufemi Popoola', 'Akindele O Adebiyi', 'Oseremen I Aisuodionoe-Shadrach', 'Hafees O Ajibola', 'Mustapha A Jamda', 'Olabode P Oluwole', 'Maxwell Nwegbu', 'Ben Adusei', 'Sunny Mante', 'Afua Darkwa-Abrahams', 'James E Mensah', 'Halimatou Diop', 'Stephen K Van Den Eeden', 'Pascal Blanchet', 'Jay H Fowke', 'Graham Casey', 'Anselm J Hennis', 'Alexander Lubwama', 'Ian M Thompson Jr', 'Robin Leach', 'Douglas F Easton', 'Michael H Preuss', 'Ruth J Loos', 'Susan M Gundell', 'Peggy Wan', 'James L Mohler', 'Elizabeth T Fontham', 'Gary J Smith', 'Jack A Taylor', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Rosaline A Eeles', 'John D Carpten', 'Adam S Kibel', 'Luc Multigner', 'Marie-Élise Parent', 'Florence Menegaux', 'Geraldine Cancel-Tassin', 'Eric A Klein', 'Caroline Andrews', 'Timothy R Rebbeck', 'Laurent Brureau', 'Stefan Ambs', 'Todd L Edwards', 'Stephen Watya', 'Stephen J Chanock', 'John S Witte', 'William J Blot', 'J Michael Gaziano', 'Amy C Justice', 'David V Conti', 'Christopher A Haiman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Common Genetic Variants Associated with Prostate Cancer Risk: The Need for African Inclusion.', 'Validation of a multi-ancestry polygenic risk score and age-specific risks of prostate cancer: A meta-analysis within diverse populations.', 'Genetic risk of prostate cancer in Ugandan men.', 'Application of European-specific polygenic risk scores for predicting prostate cancer risk in different ancestry populations.', 'How Well do Polygenic Risk Scores Identify Men at High Risk for Prostate Cancer?

Men should be aware of the potential risk of significant prostate cancer despite the lack of symptoms. Screening for prostate cancer using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been controversial. General practice guidelines can be confusing leading to men not being tested for prostate cancer. Reasons cited include overdiagnosis and overtreatment with associated morbidity.  Objective:   This article aims to highlight the current evidence for PSA testing and advocate for updating outdated guidelines and resources.  Discussion:   Current evidence shows that a risk-stratified approach to PSA screening helps to assess that risk. Recent studies show improved survival rates with early intervention compared with observation/delayed treatment. Imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging and prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography, have made a significant difference in the management pathway. Biopsy techniques have progressed to minimise sepsis risk. Quality and patient-reported outcomes registry data highlight the increased use of active surveillance in patients with low to intermediate risk of prostate cancer, reducing treatment-associated harms in men with low risk of progression.

This study revealed that MTE induced significant decreases in cell viability and clonal growth in PCa cells. In addition, MTE induced the apoptosis of DU145 cells by reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential and increasing the expression of Cleaved Caspase 3/7, Cyt c, and Bax. In vivo, DU145 xenografted NOD-SCID mice treated with MTE showed significantly decreased tumor size. TUNEL staining and Western blot confirmed the pro-apoptotic effects of MTE. Network pharmacology analysis collected 196 ingredients of MTE linked to 655 potential targets, and 709 PCa-associated targets were retrieved, from which 149 overlapped targets were screened out. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the HIF-1, PI3K-AKT, and ErbB signaling pathways were closely related to tumor apoptosis. Western blot results confirmed that MTE increased the expression of p-AKTSer473 and p-GSK3βSer9, and decreased the expression of p-STAT3Tyr705in vitro and in vivo. A total of 13 compounds in MTE were identified by HPLC-CAD-QTOF-MS/MS and UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS. Molecular docking analysis indicated that six compounds may interact with AKT, GSK3β, and STAT3.

Controlling the progression of CRPC by inhibiting AR gene expression is one of the core directions for prostate cancer (Pca) drug development. A 23-amino acids retention, named exon 3a, into the DNA binding domain of the splice variant AR23 has been shown to prevent AR from entering the nucleus and restore the sensitivity of cancer cells to related therapies. In this study, we conducted a preliminary investigation of the splicing modulation of the AR gene in order to develop a splice-switching therapy for Pca by promoting exon 3a inclusion. Using mutagenesis-coupled RT-PCR with AR minigene and over-expression of certain splicing factors, we found that serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins are key factors facilitating the recognition of the 3' splice site of exon 3a (L-3' SS), while the deletion or blocking of the polypyrimidine tract (PPT) region of the original 3' splice site of exon 3 (S-3' SS) could strongly enhance exon 3a splicing without affecting the function of any SR protein. Furthermore, we designed a series of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to screen drug candidates, and ASOs targeting S-3' SS and its PPT region or the exonic region of exon 3 turned out to be most effective in rescuing exon 3a splicing. A dose-response test indicated ASO12 as the lead candidate drug significantly promoting the inclusion of exon 3a to more than 85%.

Besides its critical role in cell cycle regulation, proto-oncogenic functions of SKP2 have also been shown in a cell cycle regulation-independent manner. Therefore, uncovering novel physiological upstream regulators of SKP2 signaling pathways would be essential to retard aggressive malignancies. Here, we report that elevation of SKP2 and EP300 transcriptomic expression is a hallmark of castration-resistant prostate cancer. We also found that SKP2 acetylation is likely a critical driven event in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells. Mechanistically, SKP2-acetylation is mediated by the p300 acetyltransferase enzyme for post-translational modification (PTM) event that is induced upon stimulation with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, ectopic expression of acetylation-mimetic K68/71Q mutant of SKP2 in LNCaP cells could confer resistance to androgen withdrawal-induced growth arrest and promotes prostate cancer stem cell (CSC)-like traits including survival, proliferation, stemness formation, lactate production, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, inhibition of p300-mediated SKP2 acetylation or SKP2-mediated p27-degradation by pharmacological inhibition of p300 or SKP2 could attenuate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the proto-oncogenic activities of the SKP2/p300 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathways. Therefore, our study identifies the SKP2/p300 axis as a possible molecular mechanism driving castration-resistant prostate cancers, which provides pharmaceutical insight into inactivation of the SKP2/p300 axis for restriction of CSC-like properties, thereby benefiting clinical diagnosis and cancer therapy.""","""['Abdol-Hossein Rezaeian', 'Liem Minh Phan', 'Xiaobo Zhou', 'Wenyi Wei', 'Hiroyuki Inuzuka']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Neoplasia""","""['Regulatory effect of Skp2 on the expression and transactivation of the androgen receptor in the progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Skp2 deficiency restricts the progression and stem cell features of castration-resistant prostate cancer by destabilizing Twist.', 'Androgen suppresses the proliferation of androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer cells via inhibition of Cdk2, CyclinA, and Skp2.', 'Androgen Receptor Coactivators in Regulation of Growth and Differentiation in Prostate Cancer.', 'Androgens as therapy for androgen receptor-positive castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'PRMT1 methylates METTL14 to modulate its oncogenic function.']"""

CDKL3 is a molecule with a recently discovered regulatory role in human tumors, and its relationship with prostate cancer is unknown. The outcomes of this work showed that CDKL3 was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and was significantly positively correlated with tumor malignancy. Knockdown of CDKL3 levels in prostate cancer cells significantly inhibited cell growth and migration and enhanced apoptosis and G2 arrest of the cell cycle. Cells with lower CDKL3 expression also had relatively weaker in vivo tumorigenic capacity as well as growth capacity. Exploration of downstream mechanisms of CDKL3 may regulate STAT1, which has co-expression characteristics with CDKL3, by inhibiting CBL-mediated ubiquitination of STAT1. Functionally, STAT1 is aberrantly overexpressed in prostate cancer and has a tumor-promoting effect similar to that of CDKL3. More importantly, the phenotypic changes of prostate cancer cells induced by CDKL3 were dependent on ERK pathway and STAT1. In summary, this work identifies CDKL3 as a new prostate cancer-promoting factor, which also has the potential to be a therapeutic target for prostate cancer.""","""['Qi Jiang#', 'Juan Li#', 'Jingyue Wang#', 'Weibing Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Identification of CDKL3 as a critical regulator in development of glioma through regulating RRM2 and the JNK signaling pathway.', 'Cyclin-dependent kinase like 3 promotes triple-negative breast cancer progression via inhibiting the p53 signaling pathway.', 'CDKL3 promotes osteosarcoma progression by activating Akt/PKB.', 'Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-secreted exosomal microRNA-205-5p exerts inhibitory effect on the progression of liver cancer through regulating CDKL3.', 'FOXO3a signaling pathway in prostate cancer: Progress in studies.']"""

Regardless of family history, NCCN recommends germline testing for patients with metastatic, regional, very-high-risk localized, and high-risk localized prostate cancer. Although African ancestry is a significant risk factor for aggressive prostate cancer, due to a lack of available data no testing criteria have been established for ethnic minorities.  Patients and methods:   Through deep sequencing, we interrogated the 20 most common germline testing panel genes in 113 Black South African males presenting with largely advanced prostate cancer. Bioinformatic tools were then used to identify the pathogenicity of the variants.  Results:   After we identified 39 predicted deleterious variants (16 genes), further computational annotation classified 17 variants as potentially oncogenic (12 genes; 17.7% of patients). Rare pathogenic variants included CHEK2 Arg95Ter, BRCA2 Trp31Arg, ATM Arg3047Ter (2 patients), and TP53 Arg282Trp. Notable oncogenic variants of unknown pathogenicity included novel BRCA2 Leu3038Ile in a patient with early-onset disease, whereas patients with FANCA Arg504Cys and RAD51C Arg260Gln reported a family history of prostate cancer. Overall, rare pathogenic and early-onset or familial-associated oncogenic variants were identified in 6.9% (5/72) and 9.2% (8/87) of patients presenting with a Gleason score ≥8 or ≥4 + 3 prostate cancer, respectively.  Conclusions:   In this first-of-its-kind study of southern African males, we provide support of African inclusion for advanced, early-onset, and familial prostate cancer genetic testing, indicating clinical value for 30% of current gene panels. Recognizing current panel limitations highlights an urgent need to establish testing guidelines for men of African ancestry. We provide a rationale for considering lowering the pathologic diagnostic inclusion criteria and call for further genome-wide interrogation to ensure the best possible African-relevant prostate cancer gene panel.""","""['Kazzem Gheybi', 'Jue Jiang', 'Shingai B A Mutambirwa', 'Pamela X Y Soh', 'Zsofia Kote-Jarai', 'Weerachai Jaratlerdsiri', 'Rosalind A Eeles', 'M S Riana Bornman', 'Vanessa M Hayes']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Natl Compr Canc Netw""","""['Gene-based Confirmatory Germline Testing Following Tumor-only Sequencing of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prevalence of Germline Variants in Prostate Cancer and Implications for Current Genetic Testing Guidelines.', 'Germline pathogenic variants in unselected Korean men with prostate cancer.', 'Germline genetics of prostate cancer.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Alterations in the Epigenetic Machinery Associated with Prostate Cancer Health Disparities.']"""

This study aims to describe the small-area variation in PSA testing across Australia.  Study design:   This was a retrospective population-based cohort study.  Methods:   We received data for PSA testing from the Australian Medicare Benefits Schedule. The cohort included men (n = 925,079) aged 50-79 years who had at least one PSA test during 2017-2018. A probability-based concordance was applied across multiple iterations (n = 50) to map each postcode to small areas (Statistical Areas 2; n = 2,129). For each iteration, a Bayesian spatial Leroux model was used to generate smoothed indirectly standardized incidence ratios across each small area, with estimates combined using model averaging.  Results:   About a quarter (26%) of the male population aged 50-79 years had a PSA test during 2017-2018. Testing rates among small areas varied 20-fold. Rates were higher (exceedance probability>0.8) compared with the Australian average in the majority of small areas in southern Victoria and South Australia, south-west Queensland, and some coastal regions of Western Australia but lower (exceedance probability<0.2) in Tasmania and Northern Territory.  Conclusions:   The substantial geographical variation in PSA testing rates across small areas of Australia may be influenced by differences in access to and guidance provided by clinicians and attitudes and preferences of men.

Correlation with prostate signal-intensity homogeneity score (PSHS) and lesion size was tested with Spearman's rank correlation.  Results:   Ninety-three patients (mean age 64.9 ± 7.1y, median serum PSA 6.5 [4.33-10.00]) were included. Mean similarity scores were statistically significantly lower between urologists and radiologists compared to radiologists only (DSC 0.41 ± 0.24 vs. 0.59 ± 0.23, p < 0.01; 95 %HD 6.38 ± 5.45 mm vs. 4.47 ± 4.12 mm, p < 0.01).

Similarity scores were worse in lesions ≤ 10 mm while other lesion features did not significantly influence similarity scores.  Conclusion:   There is significant mismatch of prostate index lesion segmentations between urologists and radiologists. Segmentation agreement positively correlates with lesion size.

Here, using transgenic mouse models of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, we found that Pygo2 deletion decelerated tumor progression, diminished metastases, and extended survival. Pygo2 loss augmented the activation and infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and sensitized tumor cells to T cell killing. Mechanistically, Pygo2 orchestrated a p53/Sp1/Kit/Ido1 signaling network to foster a microenvironment hostile to CTLs. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pygo2 enhanced the antitumor efficacy of immunotherapies using immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), adoptive cell transfer, or agents inhibiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells. In human prostate cancer samples, Pygo2 expression was inversely correlated with the infiltration of CD8+ T cells.

The model sparsity is maintained by restricting the number of nonzero coefficients in the model with a cardinality constraint, which makes the optimization problem NP-hard. In addition, we generalize the cardinality constraint for grouped feature selection, which makes it possible to identify key sets of predictors that may be measured together in a kit in clinical practice. We demonstrate the operation of our cardinality constraint-based feature subset selection method, named OSCAR, in the context of prognostic prediction of prostate cancer patients, where it enables one to determine the key explanatory predictors at different levels of model sparsity.

We utilized proportional hazards modeling of the association between PSMA-positive (PSMA+) CTC enumeration with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Overall, 97 men with mCRPC had evaluable blood samples for baseline CTC PSMA detection; 78 men (80%) had detectable CTCs. Of these, 55% (43/78) of men had any PSMA CTC detection, 21% (16/78) had ≥2 PSMA+ CTCs/mL, and 19% (8/43) were 100% PSMA+.

Among paired cases (n = 57), PSMA+ CTC detection increased slightly after abi/enza progression. Using an optimal cutoff of ≥2 PSMA+ CTCs/mL, median OS was 26, 21, and 11 months for men without CTCs, PSMA- CTCs, and PSMA+ CTCs. Adjusting for prior abi/enza therapy, Halabi clinical risk score, and CTC enumeration, the HRs for OS and PFS for PSMA+ CTC+ were 3.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-7.8] and 2.3 (95% CI = 0.9-5.8).

Results:   No statistically significant difference in adverse pathology at RP was observed between the active surveillance-eligible control (GP4 0%) and the GP4 ≤5% subgroup. In total, 68.9% of the GP4 ≤5% cohort showed favorable pathologic outcomes. A separate analysis of the GP4 ≤5% subgroup revealed that neither prebiopsy serum PSA levels nor GP4 length showed statistical correlation with adverse pathology at RP.  Conclusions:   Active surveillance may be a reasonable option for management of patients in the GP4 ≤5% group until long-term follow-up data become available.""","""['Jeffrey Ordner', 'Abdallah Flaifel', 'Antonio Serrano', 'Rebecca Graziano', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Fang-Ming Deng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Clin Pathol""","""['Gleason score 3\u2009+\u20094=7 prostate cancer with minimal quantity of gleason pattern 4 on needle biopsy is associated with low-risk tumor in radical prostatectomy specimen.', 'Cribriform architecture outperforms Gleason pattern 4 percentage and tertiary Gleason pattern 5 in predicting the outcome of Grade Group 2 prostate cancer patients.', 'Combination of total length of Gleason pattern 4 and number of Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7 cores detects similar outcome group to Gleason score 6 cancers among cases with ≥5% of Gleason pattern 4.', 'The 2019 Genitourinary Pathology Society (GUPS) White Paper on Contemporary Grading of Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

Methods:   The primary outcome was the detection of a ≥5 point deterioration in any of the four main expanded prostate index composite (EPIC) functional domains. Pretreatment multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and transperineal targeted and systematic saturation biopsy were used to select patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)≤20 ng/mL, Gleason grade group (GG) ≤4, mpMRI lesion volume ≤ 3 mL (for a single lesion) or ≤1.5 mL (where two lesions were present). Focal cryotherapy was performed with a minimum 5 mm margin around each target lesion. EPIC scores were obtained at baseline and posttreatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Mandatory repeat mpMRI and prostate biopsy were performed at 12 months to determine the infield and outfield recurrence.  Results:   Twenty-eight patients were recruited. The mean age was 68 years, with PSA of 7.3 ng/mL and PSA density of 0.19 ng/mL2 . No Clavien-Dindo ≥3 complications occurred. Transient worsening of EPIC urinary (mean diff 16.0, p < 0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.8-23.6) and sexual function scores (mean diff 11.0, p:0.005, 95% CI: 4.0-17.7) were observed at 1-month posttreatment, with recovery by Month 3. A subgroup who had ablation extending to the neurovascular bundle had a trend to delayed recovery of sexual function to Month 6. At 12-month repeat mpMRI and biopsy, 22 patients (78.6%) had no detectable csPCa. Of the six patients (21.4%) who had csPCa recurrences, four were GG2, one GG3, and one GG4. Four patients underwent repeat FT, one underwent radical prostatectomy, while the remaining one patient with low-volume GG2 cancer opted for active surveillance.

At present, however, the role of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in AS protocols has not yet been clearly established.  Outcomes:   To determine the role of mpMRI and its ability to detect significant prostate cancer (SigPCa) in PCa patients enrolled in AS protocols.  Materials and methods:   There were 229 patients enrolled in an AS protocol between 2011 and 2020 at Reina Sofía University Hospital. MRI interpretation was based on PIRADS v.1 or v.2/2.1 classification. Demographics, clinical, and analytical data were collected and analyzed. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated for mpMRI in different scenarios. We defined SigPCa and reclassification/progression as a Gleason score (GS) ≥ 3 + 4, a clinical stage ≥T2b, or an increase in PCa volume. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used to estimate progression-free survival time.  Results:   Median age was 69.02 (±7.73) at diagnosis, with a 0.15 (±0.08) PSA density (PSAD). Eighty-six patients were reclassified after confirmatory biopsy, with a suspicious mpMRI an indication for a clear reclassification and risk-predictor factor in disease progression (p < 0.05). During follow-up, 46 patients were changed from AS to active treatment mainly due to disease progression. Ninety patients underwent ≥2mpMRI during follow-up, with a median follow-up of 29 (15-49) months. Thirty-four patients had a baseline suspicious mpMRI (at diagnostic or confirmatory biopsy): 14 patients with a PIRADS 3 and 20 patients with ≥PIRADS 4. From 14 patients with a PIRADS 3 baseline mpMRI, 29% progressed radiologically, with a 50% progression rate versus 10% (1/10 patients) for those with similar or decreased mpMRI risk. Of the 56 patients with a non-suspicious baseline mpMRI (PIRADS < 2), 14 patients (25%) had an increased degree of radiological suspicion, with a detection rate of SigPCa of 29%. The mpMRI NPV during follow-up was 0.91.  Conclusion:   A suspicious mpMRI increases the reclassification and disease progression risk during follow-up and plays an important role in monitoring biopsies. In addition, a high NPV at mpMRI follow-up can help to decrease the need to monitor biopsies during AS.""","""['L Chamorro Castillo', 'L García Morales', 'D Ruiz López', 'J Salguero Segura', 'J Valero Rosa', 'F J Anglada Curado', 'J Mesa Quesada', 'A Blanca Pedregosa', 'J Carrasco Valiente', 'Enrique Gómez Gómez']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The Use of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Follow-up of Patients Included in Active Surveillance Protocol.

However, a proportion of these patients will eventually develop recurrence and progression requiring systemic therapy. Whether primary LT affects the response to this subsequent systemic treatment is unclear.  Objective:   We investigated whether the receipt of prior prostate-directed LT influenced the response to first-line systemic therapy and survival in docetaxel-naïve metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This is an exploratory analysis of the COU-AA-302 trial, a multicentric double-blinded phase 3 randomized controlled trial in which mCRPC patients with no to mild symptoms were randomized to receive abiraterone plus prednisone or placebo plus prednisone.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We compared the time-varying effects of first-line abiraterone in patients with and without prior LT using a Cox proportional hazard model. The cut points were chosen using grid search, and were 6 and 36 mo for radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. We also investigated whether there was any difference in treatment effect on score change (relative to baseline) in various patient-reported outcomes (measured by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate [FACT-P]) over time depending on the receipt of prior LT. The adjusted association of prior LT with survival was determined using weighted Cox regression models.  Results and limitations:   Among 1053 eligible patients, 64% (n = 669) received prior LT. We did not find any statistically significant heterogeneity of time-dependent treatment effect from abiraterone on rPFS in patients with (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36 [95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.49] at ≤6 mo; 0.64 [0.49-0.83] at >6 mo) or without (HR: 0.37 [0.26-0.55] at ≤6 mo; 0.72 [0.50-1.03] at >6 mo) prior LT. Similarly, there was no significant heterogeneity in time-dependent treatment effect on OS with (HR: 0.88 [0.71-1.10] at ≤36 mo; 0.76 [0.52-1.11] at >36 mo) or without (0.78 [0.60-1.01] at ≤36 mo; 0.55 [0.30-0.99] at >36 mo) prior LT. We did not find sufficient evidence of a difference in treatment effect from abiraterone on score change over time in prostate cancer subscale (interaction p = 0.4), trial outcome index (interaction p = 0.8), and FACT-P total score (interaction p = 0.6) depending on the receipt of prior LT. Receipt of prior LT was associated with a significant improvement in OS (average HR: 0.72 [0.59-0.89]).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrates that the efficacy of first-line abiraterone and prednisone in docetaxel-naïve mCRPC do not vary significantly based on the receipt of prior prostate-directed LT. Further studies are needed to explore the plausible mechanisms of the association of prior LT with superior OS.  Patient summary:   This secondary analysis of the COU-AA-302 trial suggests that survival benefits and temporal changes in quality of life with first-line abiraterone in docetaxel-naïve mCRPC do not differ significantly among patients who received versus those who did not receive prior prostate-directed local therapy.""","""['Soumyajit Roy', 'Yilun Sun', 'Scott C Morgan', 'Christopher J D Wallis', 'Kevin King', 'Yu M Zhou', ""Leah A D'souza"", 'Omar Azem', 'Adrianna E Cueto-Marquez', 'Nathaniel B Camden', 'Daniel E Spratt', 'Amar U Kishan', 'Fred Saad', 'Shawn Malone']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Updated interim efficacy analysis and long-term safety of abiraterone acetate in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients without prior chemotherapy (COU-AA-302).', 'Prior Endocrine Therapy Impact on Abiraterone Acetate Clinical Efficacy in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Post-hoc Analysis of Randomised Phase 3 Studies.', 'Impact of bone-targeted therapies in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients treated with abiraterone acetate: post hoc analysis of study COU-AA-302.', 'Abiraterone for treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Docetaxel Activity in the Era of Life-prolonging Hormonal Therapies for Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

The majority of evidence refers to its use in the PSA gray zone (4-10 ng/mL) and negative digital rectal exam (DRE). We aim to evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of PHI and PHI density (PHId) with PSA, percentage of free PSA and PSA density, in a wider range of patients for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa).  Methods:   Multicenter prospective study that included patients suspicious of harboring prostate cancer. Non-probabilistic convenience sampling, where men who attended the urology consultation were tested for PHI before prostate biopsy. To evaluate and compare diagnostic accuracy AUC and decision curve analysis (DCA) were calculated. All these procedures were performed for the overall sample and the following subsamples: PSA < 4 ng/ml; PSA 4-10 ng/ml; PSA 4-10 ng/ml plus negative DRE and PSA > 10 ng/ml.  Results:   Among the 559 men included, 194 (34.7%) were diagnosed of csPCa. PHI and PHId outperfomed PSA in all subgroups. PHI best diagnostic performance was found in PSA 4-10 ng/ml with negative DRE (sensitivity 93.33, NPV 96.04). Regarding AUC, significant differences were found between PHId and PSA in the subgroup of PSA 4-10 ng/ml, whatever DRE status. In DCA, PHI density shows the highest net benefit.

We aimed to develop a lymph node metastases diagnostic model (LNMDM) on whole slide images and to assess the clinical effect of an artificial intelligence-assisted (AI) workflow.  Methods:   In this retrospective, multicentre, diagnostic study in China, we included consecutive patients with bladder cancer who had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection, and from whom whole slide images of lymph node sections were available, for model development. We excluded patients with non-bladder cancer and concurrent surgery, or low-quality images. Patients from two hospitals (Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were assigned before a cutoff date to a training set and after the date to internal validation sets for each hospital. Patients from three other hospitals (the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) were included as external validation sets. A validation subset of challenging cases from the five validation sets was used to compare performance between the LNMDM and pathologists, and two other datasets (breast cancer from the CAMELYON16 dataset and prostate cancer from the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University) were collected for a multi-cancer test. The primary endpoint was diagnostic sensitivity in the four prespecified groups (ie, the five validation sets, a single-lymph-node test set, the multi-cancer test set, and the subset for a performance comparison between the LNMDM and pathologists).  Findings:   Between Jan 1, 2013 and Dec 31, 2021, 1012 patients with bladder cancer had radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection and were included (8177 images and 20 954 lymph nodes). We excluded 14 patients (165 images) with concurrent non-bladder cancer and also excluded 21 low-quality images. We included 998 patients and 7991 images (881 [88%] men; 117 [12%] women; median age 64 years [IQR 56-72]; ethnicity data not available; 268 [27%] with lymph node metastases) to develop the LNMDM. The area under the curve (AUC) for accurate diagnosis of the LNMDM ranged from 0·978 (95% CI 0·960-0·996) to 0·998 (0·996-1·000) in the five validation sets. Performance comparisons between the LNMDM and pathologists showed that the diagnostic sensitivity of the model (0·983 [95% CI 0·941-0·998]) substantially exceeded that of both junior pathologists (0·906 [0·871-0·934]) and senior pathologists (0·947 [0·919-0·968]), and that AI assistance improved sensitivity for both junior (from 0·906 without AI to 0·953 with AI) and senior (from 0·947 to 0·986) pathologists. In the multi-cancer test, the LNMDM maintained an AUC of 0·943 (95% CI 0·918-0·969) in breast cancer images and 0·922 (0·884-0·960) in prostate cancer images. In 13 patients, the LNMDM detected tumour micrometastases that had been missed by pathologists who had previously classified these patients' results as negative. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that the LNMDM would enable pathologists to exclude 80-92% of negative slides while maintaining 100% sensitivity in clinical application.  Interpretation:   We developed an AI-based diagnostic model that did well in detecting lymph node metastases, particularly micrometastases. The LNMDM showed substantial potential for clinical applications in improving the accuracy and efficiency of pathologists' work.

By constitutively sustaining androgen receptor (AR) signaling, expression of ligand-binding domain truncated AR variants (AR-V(ΔLBD)) accounts for the major mechanism underlying the resistance to anti-androgen drugs. Strategies to target AR and its LBD truncated variants are needed to prevent the emergence or overcome drug resistance.  Methods:   We utilize Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTAC) technology to achieve induced degradation of both full-length AR (AR-FL) and AR-V(ΔLBD) proteins. In the ITRI-PROTAC design, an AR N-terminal domain (NTD) binding moiety is appended to von-Hippel-Lindau (VHL) or Cereblon (CRBN) E3 ligase binding ligand with linker.  Findings:   In vitro studies demonstrate that ITRI-PROTAC compounds mechanistically degrade AR-FL and AR-V(ΔLBD) proteins via ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to impaired AR transactivation on target gene expression, and inhibited cell proliferation accompanied by apoptosis activation. The compounds also significantly inhibit enzalutamide-resistant growth of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells. In castration-, enzalutamide-resistant CWR22Rv1 xenograft model without hormone ablation, ITRI-90 displays a pharmacokinetic profile with decent oral bioavailability and strong antitumor efficacy.  Interpretation:   AR NTD that governs the transcriptional activities of all active variants has been considered attractive therapeutic target to block AR signaling in prostate cancer cells. We demonstrated that utilizing PROTAC for induced AR protein degradation via NTD represents an efficient alternative therapeutic strategy for CRPC to overcome anti-androgen resistance.

On the other hand, compounds 10c and 11e showed lower inhibition on the same cell lines with IC50 = 3.58, 4.58, 4.28 μM respectively for 10c, IC50 = 3.43, 4.73, 4.43 μM respectively for 11e. Furthermore, DNA-flow cytometric analysis showed that compound 11a induces cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase leading to cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis. Additionally, these derivatives examined against F180 fibroblasts to investigate their selectivity indexes. The pyrazole derivative with internal oxime 11a was the most potent compound against most used cell lines especially MCF-7, IGROV1 and SK-MEL-5 (IC50 = 3.12, 4.28, 4.13 μM respectively) with 4.82-fold selectivity towards MCF-7 than F180 fibroblasts. Moreover, oxime derivative 11a showed potent aromatase inhibitory activity (IC50 16.50 μM) when compared with reference compound letrozole (IC50 15.60 μM). All compounds 10a-f and 11a-f released NO in a slow rate (0.73-3.88 %) and the six derivatives 10c, 10e, 11a, 11b, 11c and 11e were the highest NO releasers (3.88, 2.15, 3.27, 2.27, 2.55 and 3.74 % respectively). Herein structure based and ligand based studies were implemented to under stand and evaluate the compounds activity for further in vivo and preclinical studies. Docking mode of final designed compounds with celecoxib (ID: 3LN1) represented that their triazole ring adopted as the core aryl in Y shaped structure. Regarding aromatase enzyme inhibition, docking was carried out with ID: 1 M17. The internal oxime series was more active as anticancer because of their ability to form extra HBs with receptor cleft.""","""['Wael A A Fadaly', 'Yaseen A M M Elshaier', 'Mohamed T M Nemr', 'Khaled R A Abdellatif']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['New 1,2,4-triazole/pyrazole hybrids linked to oxime moiety as nitric oxide donor celecoxib analogs: Synthesis, cyclooxygenase inhibition anti-inflammatory, ulcerogenicity, anti-proliferative activities, apoptosis, molecular modeling and nitric oxide release studies.', 'Novel 1,3-diaryl pyrazole derivatives bearing methylsulfonyl moiety: Design, synthesis, molecular docking and dynamics, with dual activities as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents through selectively targeting COX-2.', 'Design, synthesis, and molecular docking of novel pyrazole-chalcone analogs of lonazolac as 5-LOX, iNOS and tubulin polymerization inhibitors with potential anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities.', '2-Anilinopyrimidine derivatives: Design, synthesis, in vitro anti-proliferative activity, EGFR and ARO inhibitory activity, cell cycle analysis and molecular docking study.', 'A review of synthetic strategy, SAR, docking, simulation studies, and mechanism of action of isoxazole derivatives as anticancer agents.']"""

However, the combination of these procedures in the clinical setting is still not standardized.  Methods:   One hundred prospectively recruited biochemical recurrent PCa patients were restaged with dual-phase [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT from September 2020 to October 2021. All patients received a standard scan (60 min), followed by diuretics (140 min) and a late-phase abdominopelvic scan (180 min). PET readers with low (n = 2), intermediate (n = 2), or high (n = 2) experience rated (i) standard and (ii) standard + forced diuresis late-phase images in a stepwise fashion according to E-PSMA guidelines, scoring their level of confidence. Study endpoints were (i) accuracy against a composite reference standard, (ii) reader's confidence level, and (iii) interobserver agreement.  Results:   Forced diuresis late-phase imaging increased the reader's confidence category for local and nodal restaging (both p < 0.0001), and the interobserver agreement in identifying nodal recurrences (from moderate to substantial, p < 0.01). However, it significantly increased diagnostic accuracy exclusively for local uptakes rated by low-experienced readers (from 76.5 to 84%, p = 0.05) and for nodal uptakes rated as uncertain at standard imaging (from 68.1 to 78.5%, p < 0.05). In this framework, SUVmax kinetics resulted in an independent predictor of PCa recurrence compared to standard metrics, potentially guiding the dual-phase PET/CT interpretation.  Conclusions:   The present results do not support the systematic combination of forced diuresis and late-phase imaging in the clinical setting, but allow the identification of patients-, lesions-, and reader-based scenarios that might benefit from it.  Key points:   • Increased detection of prostate cancer recurrences has been reported by adding diuretics administration or an additional late abdominopelvic scan to the standard [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT procedure. • We verified the added value of combined forced diuresis and delayed imaging, showing that this protocol only slightly increases the diagnostic accuracy of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, thus not justifying its systematic use in clinics. • However, it can be helpful in specific clinical scenarios, e.g., when PET/CT is reported by low-experienced readers.

Results:   A total of 502 patients were included. The incidence of PTIs was 22% in the SV analysis, 7% in the SQ analysis, and 2% in the RV analysis. PTI incidences differed significantly from 29 to 64% (SQ, resp. SV analysis) for [18F]PSMA-1007, 7 to 23% for [68Ga]PSMA﻿-11, 2 to 8% for [18F]DCFPyL, and to 0% for [18F]PSMA-JK-7. The majority of PTI in the SV and SQ analyses consisted of diffuse (72-83%) and/or only slightly elevated thyroidal uptake (70%). Inter-observer agreement in the SV analysis was substantial (kappa = 0.76-0.78). During follow-up (median 16.8 months), there were no thyroid-related adverse events except in three patients.  Conclusions:   The incidence of PTI varies greatly among different PSMA PET tracers and is strongly dependent on the analysis method applied. PTI may safely be restricted to focal thyroidal uptake with a SUVmax t/b ratio ≥ 2.0. The clinical pursuit of a PTI must be weighed up to the expected outcome of the underlying disease.

Also, IR increases cancer cell adhesion with no significant effects on normal cells. In this study, synchrotron-based microbeam radiation therapy, as a novel pre-clinical radiotherapy protocol, is employed to investigate the effects of AuNPs on cell migration. Experiments were conducted utilizing synchrotron X-rays to investigate cancer and normal cell morphology and migration behaviour when they are exposed to synchrotron broad beams (SBB) and synchrotron microbeams (SMB). This in vitro study was conducted in two phases. In phase I two cancer cell lines - human prostate (DU145) and human lung (A549) - were exposed to various doses of SBB and SMB. Based on the phase I results, in phase II two normal cell lines were studied: human epidermal melanocytes (HEM) and human primary colon epithelial (CCD841), along with their respective cancerous counterparts, human primary melanoma (MM418-C1) and human colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW48). The results show that radiation-induced damage in cells' morphology becomes visible with SBB at doses greater than 50 Gy, and incorporating AuNPs increases this effect. Interestly, under the same conditions, no visible morphological changes were observed in the normal cell lines post-irradiation (HEM and CCD841). This can be attributed to the differences in cell metabolic and reactive oxygen species levels between normal and cancer cells.

Cellular senescence, a specialized cell cycle arrest form, results in the secretion of various inflammatory mediators. In recent studies, senescence has shown an essential role in tumorigenesis and tumor development, yet the extensive effects of senescence in PCa have not been systematically investigated. Here, we aimed to develop a feasible senescence-associated prognosis model for early identification and appropriate management in patients with PCa.  Method:   The RNA sequence results and clinical information available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and a list of experimentally validated senescence-related genes (SRGs) from the CellAge database were first obtained. Then, a senescence-risk signature related with prognosis was constructed using univariate Cox and LASSO regression analysis. We calculated the risk score of each patient and divided them into high-risk and low-risk groups in terms of the median value. Furthermore, two datasets (GSE70770 and GSE46602) were used to assess the effects of the risk model. A nomogram was built by integrating the risk score and clinical characteristics, which was further verified using ROC curves and calibrations. Finally, we compared the differences in the tumor microenvironment (TME) landscape, drug susceptibility, and the functional enrichment among the different risk groups.  Results:   We established a unique prognostic signature in PCa patients based on eight SRGs, including CENPA, ADCK5, FOXM1, TFAP4, MAPK, LGALS3, BAG3, and NOX4, and validated well prognosis-predictive power in independent datasets. The risk model was associated with age and TNM staging, and the calibration chart presented a high consistency in nomogram prediction. Additionally, the prognostic signature could serve as an independent prediction factor due to its high accuracy. Notably, we found that the risk score was positively associated with tumor mutation burden (TMB) and immune checkpoint, whereas negatively correlated with tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE), suggesting that these patients with risk scores were more sensitive to immunotherapy. Drug susceptibility analysis revealed differences in the responses to general drugs (docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, 5-Fluorouracil, cisplatin, paclitaxel, and vincristine) were yielded between the two risk groups.  Conclusion:   Identifying the SRG-score signature may become a promising method for predicting the prognosis of patients with PCa and tailoring appropriate treatment strategies.""","""['Chenglin Han', 'Yuxuan Deng', 'Bin Yang', 'Peng Hu', 'Bintao Hu', 'Tao Wang', 'Jihong Liu', 'Qidong Xia', 'Xiaming Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'A cuproptosis-related LncRNA signature: Integrated analysis associated with biochemical recurrence and immune landscape in prostate cancer.', 'A Four-Cell-Senescence-Regulator-Gene Prognostic Index Verified by Genome-Wide CRISPR Can Depict the Tumor Microenvironment and Guide Clinical Treatment of Bladder Cancer.', 'A novel senescence-related lncRNA signature that predicts prognosis and the tumor microenvironment in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification and validation of a novel cellular senescence-related lncRNA prognostic signature for predicting immunotherapy response in stomach adenocarcinoma.']"""

We studied the effect of hydroalcoholic extract from dried leaves of Buxus sempervirens (BSHE) on four human cell lines (BMel melanoma cells, HCT116 colorectal carcinoma cells, PC3 prostate cancer cells, and HS27 skin fibroblasts) to ascertain its possible antineoplastic activity. This extract inhibited proliferation of all cell lines in different degree as shown, after 48 h-exposure and MTS assay, by the values of GR50 (normalized growth rate inhibition50) that were 72, 48, 38, and 32 μg/mL for HS27, HCT116, PC3 and BMel cells, respectively. At the above GR50 concentrations, 99% of all studied cells remained vital showing accumulation of acidic vesicles in the cytoplasm, mainly around nuclei, whereas a higher extract concentration (125 μg/mL) was cytotoxic causing, after 48 h-exposure, death of all BMel and HCT116 cells. Immunofluorescence showed microtubule-associated light chain three protein (LC3, a marker for autophagy) to be localized on the above acidic vesicles when cells were treated for 48 h with BSHE (GR50 concentrations). Western blot analysis revealed, in all treated cells, a significant increase (2.2-3.3 times at 24 h) of LC3II, i.e., the phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate of the cytoplasmic form LC3I that is recruited in autophagosome membranes during autophagy. Such increase was accompanied, in all cell lines treated for 24 h or 48 h with BSHE, by a significant increment (2.5-3.4 times at 24 h) of p62, an autophagic cargo protein undergoing degradation during the autophagic process. Therefore, BSHE appeared to promote autophagic flow with its following blockade and consequent accumulation of autophagosome or autolysosomes. The antiproliferative effects of BSHE also involved cell cycle regulators such as p21 (HS27, BMel and HCT116 cells) and cyclin B1 (HCT116, BMel and PC3 cells) whereas, among apoptosis markers, BSHE only decreased (30%-40% at 48 h) the expression of the antiapoptotic protein survivin. It was concluded that BSHE impairs autophagic flow with arrest of proliferation and death in both fibroblasts and cancer cells, being the latter much more sensitive to these effects.""","""['Anna Rita Volpe', 'Marco Carmignani', 'Patrizia Cesare']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Pharmacol""","""['Acetonic extract of Buxus sempervirens induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy in breast cancer cells.', 'Autophagic flux determines cell death and survival in response to Apo2L/TRAIL (dulanermin).', 'Buxus sempervirens L.

Methods:   We retrospectively examined data of 70 healthy males (aged 18-65-years-old) from four different altitudes cities in Peru: Lima (<150 m), Huancayo (2380 m), Puno (3800 m), and Cerro de Pasco (4320 m). Serum hepcidin, testosterone, and PSA were analyzed by chemiluminescence immunoassay. HA parameters (hemoglobin [Hb], pulse oxygen saturation [SpO2], and chronic mountain sickness [CMS] score) were also included in the study. Bivariate analyses and a multivariate linear mixed model were used to evaluate the association between hepcidin and PSA, adjusted by HA parameters, age, and body mass index (BMI).  Results:   Cases of excessive erythrocytosis (EE) (Hb >21 g/dL) were observed in the three highest cities. Hepcidin was positively correlated with Hb, CMS score, and BMI (P ≤ 0.05). Hepcidin was higher in Huancayo with respect to Puno, while PSA was lower in Cerro de Pasco in regard to Puno and Lima (P ≤ 0.05). Neither hepcidin nor PSA was increased by altitude in each city (P > 0.05). We did not find an association between hepcidin and PSA, even adjusted by age, BMI, Hb, and SpO2 (P ≤ 0.05).  Conclusion:   These findings showed no association between hepcidin and PSA levels in healthy residents at HA.""","""['Diana E Alcantara-Zapata', 'Markus Thiersch', 'Gustavo F Gonzales']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Health Sci (Qassim)""","""['Excessive Erythrocytosis and Cardiovascular Risk in Andean Highlanders.', 'Serum immunoreactive erythropoietin in high altitude natives with and without excessive erythrocytosis.', 'Plasma soluble erythropoietin receptor is decreased during sleep in Andean highlanders with Chronic Mountain Sickness.', 'Higher androgen bioactivity is associated with excessive erythrocytosis and chronic mountain sickness in Andean Highlanders: a review.', 'Serum testosterone levels and excessive erythrocytosis during the process of adaptation to high altitudes.']"""

This study aimed to compare outcomes of estimated blood loss and postoperative pain, determined by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), between RARP and standard laparoscopic radical -prostatectomy (LRP). MATERIAL AND METHODS We enrolled 57 patients who had localized prostate cancer (28 patients in RARP, 29 patients in LRP). Primary outcomes were estimated blood loss (EBL) measured by gravimetric method for gauze and visual estimation for suction bottle, and PCA bolus count that the bolus doses were injected at the 1st, the 6th, the 24th, and the 48th hour after the operation. We recorded anesthesia and operation time, pneumoperitoneum duration, vital signs, fluid volume, and remifentanil use. Using the numeric rating scale (NRS), adverse effects were checked at the 1st, the 6th, the 24th, and the 48th hour and patient satisfaction was assessed at the 48th hour after the operation. RESULTS Anesthesia time, operation time, and gas insufflation time were longer (P=0.001, P=0.003, P=0.021), and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) bolus counts at the 1st hour after the operation and volumes of administered crystalloid and remifentanil were higher in the RARP group than in the LRP group (P=0.013, P=0.011, P=0.031). There were no significant differences in EBL. CONCLUSIONS The RARP group required longer anesthetic time and more analgesics during the acute postoperative period compared to the LRP group. Regarding anesthesia, LRP is as good a surgical procedure as RARP until the operation time and the number of ports are reduced.""","""['Dowon Lee', 'Boo-Young Hwang', 'Jae-Young Kwon', 'Ohyun Kim', 'Jeong-Min Hong', 'Hyae Jin Kim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Sci Monit""","""['Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robot-assisted vs open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer: a Cochrane systematic review.', 'Comparison of Acute and Chronic Surgical Complications Following Robot-Assisted, Laparoscopic, and Traditional Open Radical Prostatectomy Among Men in Taiwan.', 'Five-year Outcomes for a Prospective Randomised Controlled Trial Comparing Laparoscopic and Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Comparison of perioperative, functional, and oncologic outcomes between standard laparoscopic and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy: a systemic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Data of patients with prostate cancer (106 who underwent C-LESS-RP, 124 underwent R-LESS-RP) were retrospectively collected and analyzed. All operations were performed by the same surgeon from January 8, 2018, to January 6, 2021, in the same institution. Information on clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes was obtained from records at the medical institution. Postoperative outcomes were acquired from follow-up. Intergroup differences were retrospectively analyzed and compared. All patients had similar clinical characteristics in meaningful aspects. The perioperative outcomes were better with R-LESS-RP than with C-LESS-RP in terms of operation time (120 min vs. 150 min, p < 0.05), estimated blood loss (17.68 ml vs. 33.68 ml, p < 0.05), and analgesic duration (0 days vs. 1 days, p < 0.05). The drainage tube duration and postoperative stay did not differ significantly between groups. However, R-LESS-RP was more expensive than C-LESS-RP (56559.510 CNY vs. 44818.27 CNY, p < 0.05). The patients who underwent R-LESS-RP had better urinary incontinence recovery and higher European quality of life visual analog scale scores than those who underwent C-LESS-RP. However, no significant intergroup difference was noted in biochemical recurrence. In conclusion, R-LESS-RP could achieve better perioperative outcomes, especially for those skilled surgeons who have mastered C-LESS-RP. Additionally, R-LESS-RP accelerated the recovery from urinary incontinence effectively and presented some benefits in health-related quality of life with additional costs.""","""['Yong Wei#', 'Qianying Ji#', 'Xin Zhou#', 'Luming Shen', 'Xiaping Wang', 'Chen Zhu', 'Jian Su', 'Qingyi Zhu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Community-based Outcomes of Open versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Laparoendoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP): stepwise transition from multi-site to single-site with the aid of the transurethral port.', 'A Systematic Review of the Impact of Surgeon and Hospital Caseload Volume on Oncological and Nononcological Outcomes After Radical Prostatectomy for Nonmetastatic Prostate Cancer.', 'A critical analysis of the long-term impact of radical prostatectomy on cancer control and function outcomes.']"""

Objective:   To investigate oncological and functional outcomes for men treated with salvage whole-gland cryoablation (SWGC) of the prostate for RRPC.  Design, setting, and participants:   We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively collected cryosurgery database between January 2002 and September 2019 for men who were treated with SWGC of the prostate at a tertiary referral center.  Intervention:   SWGC of the prostate.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary outcome was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) according to the Phoenix criterion. Secondary outcomes included metastasis-free survival, cancer-specific survival, and adverse events.  Results and limitations:   A total of 110 men with biopsy-proven RRPC were included in the study. Median follow-up for patients without biochemical recurrence (BCR) after SWGC was 71 mo (interquartile range [IQR] 42.3-116). BRFS was 81% at 2 yr and 71% at 5 yr. A higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) nadir after SWGC was associated with worse BRFS. The median International Index of Erectile Function-5 score was 5 (IQR 1-15.5) before SWGC and 1 (IQR 1-4) after SWGC. Stress urinary incontinence, strictly defined as the use of any pads after treatment, was 5% at 3 mo and 9% at 12 mo. Clavien-Dindo grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in three patients (2.7%).  Conclusions:   In patients with localized RPPC, SWGC achieved excellent oncological outcomes with a low rate of urinary incontinence, and represents an alternative to salvage radical prostatectomy. Patients with fewer positive cores and lower PSA tended to have better oncological outcomes following SWGC.  Patient summary:   For men with prostate cancer that persists after radiotherapy, a freezing treatment applied to the whole prostate gland can achieve excellent cancer control. Patients who did not have elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) at 6 years after this treatment appeared to be cured.""","""['Wei Phin Tan', 'Srinath Kotamarti', 'Alexandria Ayala', 'Rachael Mahle', 'Emily Chen', 'Rohith Arcot', 'Andrew Chang', 'Zoe Michael', 'Denis Seguier', 'Thomas J Polascik']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Oncological and functional outcomes of men undergoing primary whole gland cryoablation of the prostate: A 20-year experience.', 'Salvage Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Transurethral Ultrasound Ablation for Localized Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer: 12-Month Functional and Oncological Results.', 'Functional and oncological outcomes of salvage cryosurgery for radiorecurrent prostate cancer.', 'Salvage partial gland ablation for recurrent prostate cancer following primary partial gland ablation: Functional and oncological outcomes.', 'Systematic Review of Focal and Salvage Cryotherapy for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Comparisons of outcomes by isotope type are limited, but Pd-103 has distinct radiobiologic advantages over I-125 despite its lesser availability outside the United States. We evaluated oncologic outcomes after Pd-103 vs I-125 LDR monotherapy for prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively analyzed databases at 8 institutions for men who received definitive LDR monotherapy with Pd-103 (n = 1,597) or I-125 (n = 7,504) for prostate cancer. Freedom from clinical failure (FFCF) and freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) stratified by isotope were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier univariate and Cox multivariate analyses. Biochemical cure rates (prostate-specific antigen level ≤ 0.2 ng/mL between 3.5 and 4.5 years of follow-up) by isotype were calculated for men with at least 3.5 years of follow-up and compared by univariate and multivariate logistic regression.  Results:   Compared with I-125, Pd-103 led to higher 7-year rates of FFBF (96.2% vs 87.6%, P < 0.001) and FFCF (96.5% vs 94.3%, P < 0.001). This difference held after multivariate adjustment for baseline factors (FFBF hazard ratio [HR] = 0.31, FFCF HR = 0.49, both P < 0.001). Pd-103 was also associated with higher cure rates on univariate (odds ratio [OR] = 5.9, P < 0.001) and multivariate (OR = 6.0, P < 0.001) analyses. Results retained significance in sensitivity analyses of data from the 4 institutions that used both isotopes (n = 2,971).

Genitourinary (GU) symptoms after prostate radiation therapy affect patient health-related quality of life (QoL). We compared patient-reported GU QoL outcomes following 2 alternative urethral sparing stereotactic body radiation therapy regimens.  Methods and materials:   Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC)-26 GU scores were compared between 2 urethral sparing stereotactic body radiation therapy trials. The SPARK trial prescribed a ""Monotherapy"" dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions to the prostate. The PROMETHEUS trial prescribed 2 phases: a 19- to 21-Gy in 2 fractions ""Boost"" to the prostate, followed by 46 Gy in 23 fractions or 36 Gy in 12 fractions. The biological effective dose (BED) for urethral toxicity was 123.9 Gy for Monotherapy and 155.8 to 171.2 Gy for Boost. Mixed effects logistic regression models were utilized to estimate the difference in the odds of a minimal clinically important change from baseline EPIC-26 GU score between regimens at each follow-up.  Results:   46 Monotherapy and 149 Boost patients completed baseline EPIC-26 scoring. Mean EPIC-26 GU scores revealed statistically superior urinary incontinence outcomes for Monotherapy at 12 months (mean difference, 6.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-12.1; P = .01) and 36 months (mean difference, 9.6; 95% CI, 4.1-15.1; P < .01). Monotherapy also revealed superior mean urinary irritative/obstructive outcomes at 12 months (mean difference, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.0-12.9; P < .01) and 36 months (mean difference, 6.3; 95% CI, 1.9-10.8; P < .01). For both domains and at all time points, the absolute differences were <10%. There were no significant differences in the odds of reporting a minimal clinically important change between regimens at any time point.  Conclusions:   Even in the presence of urethral sparing, the higher BED delivered in the Boost schedule may have a small adverse effect on GU QoL compared with Monotherapy. However, this did not translate to statistically significant differences in minimal clinically important changes.

MAGI2-AS3 was found to be aberrantly decreased in CRPC and was negatively correlated with Gleason score and lymph node status. Notably, low MAGI2-AS3 expression positively correlated with poorer survival in patients with PCa. The overexpression of MAGI2-AS3 significantly inhibited the proliferation and migration of PCa in vitro and in vivo.

The aim of the study is to investigate the presentation and outcomes of hospital admission with acute HF in a national cohort of patients with prior cancer.  Methods and results:   This retrospective, population-based cohort study identified 221 953 patients admitted to a hospital in England for HF during 2012-2018 (12 867 with a breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer diagnosis in the previous 10 years). We examined the impact of cancer on (i) HF presentation and in-hospital mortality, (ii) place of care, (iii) HF medication prescribing, and (iv) post-discharge survival, using propensity score weighting and model-based adjustment. Heart failure presentation was similar between cancer and non-cancer patients. A lower percentage of patients with prior cancer were cared for in a cardiology ward [-2.4% age point difference (ppd) (95% CI -3.3, -1.6)] or were prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists (ACEi/ARB) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [-2.1 ppd (-3.3, -0.9)] than non-cancer patients. Survival after HF discharge was poor with median survival of 1.6 years in prior cancer and 2.6 years in non-cancer patients. Mortality in prior cancer patients was driven primarily by non-cancer causes (68% of post-discharge deaths).  Conclusion:   Survival in prior cancer patients presenting with acute HF was poor, with a significant proportion due to non-cancer causes of death. Despite this, cardiologists were less likely to manage cancer patients with HF. Cancer patients who develop HF were less likely to be prescribed guideline-based HF medications compared with non-cancer patients.

PCa cell lines DU145 and PC3 were transfected with miR-124-3p inhibitors or analogs. EZH2 and miR-124-3p linkage was validated by conducting the luciferase enzyme reporter test.

Methods:   During the period 2008-2013, 697 hospital-based incident prostate cancer cases (97 aggressive tumors) and 927 population-based controls were recruited in Spain, providing information on residential histories and type of water consumed. Average nitrate and THMs levels in drinking water were linked with lifetime water consumption to calculate waterborne ingestion. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using mixed models with recruitment area as random effect. Effect modification by tumor grade (Gleason score), age, education, lifestyle, and dietary factors was explored.  Results:   Mean (±standard deviation) adult lifetime waterborne ingested nitrate (milligrams per day), brominated (Br)-THMs (micrograms per day), and chloroform (micrograms per day) were 11.5 (±9.0), 20.7 (±32.4), and 15.1 (±14.7) in controls. Waterborne ingested nitrate >13.8 vs. <5.5mg/d was associated with an OR of 1.74 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.54) overall, and 2.78 (95% CI: 1.23, 6.27) for tumors with Gleason scores ≥8. Associations were higher in the youngest and those with lower intakes of fiber, fruit/vegetables, and vitamin C. Waterborne ingested THMs were not associated with prostate cancer. Residential tap water levels of Br-THMs and chloroform showed, respectively, inverse and positive associations with prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Findings suggest long-term waterborne ingested nitrate could be a risk factor of prostate cancer, particularly for aggressive tumors. High intakes of fiber, fruit/vegetables and vitamin C may lower this risk. Association with residential levels but not ingested chloroform/Br-THM may suggest inhalation and dermal routes could be relevant for prostate cancer. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11391.""","""['Carolina Donat-Vargas', 'Manolis Kogevinas', 'Gemma Castaño-Vinyals', 'Beatriz Pérez-Gómez', 'Javier Llorca', 'Mercedes Vanaclocha-Espí', 'Guillermo Fernandez-Tardon', 'Laura Costas', 'Nuria Aragonés', 'Inés Gómez-Acebo', 'Victor Moreno', 'Marina Pollan', 'Cristina M Villanueva']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Environ Health Perspect""","""['Colorectal Cancer and Long-Term Exposure to Trihalomethanes in Drinking Water: A Multicenter Case-Control Study in Spain and Italy.', 'Exposure to widespread drinking water chemicals, blood inflammation markers, and colorectal cancer.', 'Long-term exposure to trihalomethanes in drinking water and breast cancer in the Spanish multicase-control study on cancer (MCC-SPAIN).', 'Ingested Nitrate and Breast Cancer in the Spanish Multicase-Control Study on Cancer (MCC-Spain).', 'A review on the 40th anniversary of the first regulation of drinking water disinfection by-products.', 'Nitrates and Prostate Cancer: Long-Term Drinking Water Exposures Associated with Risk of Tumors.']"""

To enable this for prototype-stage algorithms, where the majority of existing research remains, we introduce a flexible federated learning framework for cross-site training, validation, and evaluation of custom deep learning prostate cancer detection algorithms.  Materials and methods:   We introduce an abstraction of prostate cancer groundtruth that represents diverse annotation and histopathology data. We maximize use of this groundtruth if and when they are available using UCNet, a custom 3D UNet that enables simultaneous supervision of pixel-wise, region-wise, and gland-wise classification. We leverage these modules to perform cross-site federated training using 1400+ heterogeneous multi-parameteric prostate MRI exams from two University hospitals.  Results:   We observe a positive result, with significant improvements in cross-site generalization performance with negligible intra-site performance degradation for both lesion segmentation and per-lesion binary classification of clinically-significant prostate cancer. Cross-site lesion segmentation performance intersection-over-union (IoU) improved by 100%, while cross-site lesion classification performance overall accuracy improved by 9.5-14.8%, depending on the optimal checkpoint selected by each site.  Conclusion:   Federated learning can improve the generalization performance of prostate cancer detection models across institutions while protecting patient health information and institution-specific code and data. However, even more data and participating institutions are likely required to improve the absolute performance of prostate cancer classification models.

Early intracavernous (IC) injection of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) after nerve crushing improves erectile function (EF) in rats by promoting cavernous nerve (CN) regeneration and preventing structural changes in the corpus cavernosum. However, the neuroprotective effects of the in situ application of PRP glue in rats after CN-sparing prostatectomy (CNSP) remain unclear.  Aim:   This study aimed to investigate the effects of PRP glue treatment on EF and CN preservation in rats after CNSP.  Methods:   After prostatectomy, male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with PRP glue, IC PRP injection, or their combination. The intracavernous pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and CN preservation status in the rats were evaluated after 4 weeks. Results were corroborated using histology, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy.  Results:   The PRP glue-treated rats showed 100% CN preservation and significantly higher ICP responses (the ratio of maximum ICP to MAP (0.79 ± 0.09)) than the CNSP rats (the ratio of maximum ICP to MAP (0.33 ± 0.04)). PRP glue also significantly increased neurofilament-1 expression, indicating its positive effect on the CNs. Furthermore, this treatment significantly increased the expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Electron micrographs revealed that PRP glue preserved the myelinated axons and prevented atrophy of the corporal smooth muscle by maintaining the adherens junctions.  Conclusions:   These results indicate that PRP glue is a potential solution for EF preservation by neuroprotection in patients with prostate cancer who are likely to undergo nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy.""","""['Chun-Hou Liao', 'Chi-Jen Chang', 'Kuo-Chiang Chen', 'Chellappan Praveen Rajneesh', 'Xiao-Wen Tseng', 'Jai-Hong Cheng', 'Han-Sun Chiang', 'Yi-No Wu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""[""CXCL5 Cytokine Is a Major Factor in Platelet-Rich Plasma's Preservation of Erectile Function in Rats After Bilateral Cavernous Nerve Injury."", 'The neuroprotective effect of platelet-rich plasma on erectile function in bilateral cavernous nerve injury rat model.', 'Intracavernous injection of platelet-rich plasma reverses erectile dysfunction of chronic cavernous nerve degeneration through reduction of prostate hyperplasia evidence from an aging-induced erectile dysfunction rat model.', 'Bilateral Cavernous Nerve Crush Injury in the Rat Model: A Comparative Review of Pharmacologic Interventions.', 'Application of Rat Model of Neurotic Erectile Dysfunction in Experiment.']"""

Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) is an established treatment for testicular germ cell tumors with minimal late morbidity although little data exist on its efficacy in early metastatic seminoma. Surgery in early metastatic seminoma is a prospective phase II single-arm, multi-institutional trial of RPLND as first-line treatment for testicular seminoma with clinically low-volume retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Patients and methods:   Twelve sites in the United States and Canada prospectively enrolled adult patients with testicular seminoma and isolated retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy (1-3 cm). Open RPLND was performed by certified surgeons with a primary end point of 2-year recurrence-free survival (RFS). Complication rates, pathologic up/downstaging, recurrence patterns, adjuvant therapies, and treatment-free survival were assessed.  Results:   A total of 55 patients were enrolled, with a median (IQR) largest clinical lymph node size of 1.6 cm (1.3-1.9). RPLND pathology demonstrated a median (IQR) largest lymph node size of 2.3 cm (0.9-3.5); nine patients (16%) were pN0, 12 (22%) pN1, 31 (56%) pN2, and 3 (5%) pN3. One patient received adjuvant chemotherapy. With a median (IQR) follow-up of 33 months (12.0-61.6), 12 patients experienced recurrence, with a 2-year RFS of 81% and a recurrence rate of 22%. Of the patients who experienced recurrence, 10 were treated with chemotherapy and two underwent additional surgery. At last follow-up, all patients who experienced a recurrence were disease-free and the 2-year overall survival was 100%. Four patients (7%) experienced short-term complications, and four patients experienced long-term complications including incisional hernia (1) and anejaculation (3).

Our previous research demonstrated that focally amplified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) on chromosome 1 (FALEC) is an oncogenic lncRNA in prostate cancer (PCa). However, the role of FALEC in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is poorly understood. In this study, we showed FALEC was upregulated in post-castration tissues and CRPC cells, and increased FALEC expression was associated with poor survival in post-castration PCa patients. RNA FISH demonstrated FALEC was translocated into nucleus in CRPC cells. RNA pulldown and followed Mass Spectrometry (MS) assay demonstrated FALEC directly interacted with PARP1 and loss of function assay showed FALEC depletion sensitized CRPC cells to castration treatment and restored NAD+. Specific PARP1 inhibitor AG14361 and NAD+ endogenous competitor NADP+ sensitized FALEC-deleted CRPC cells to castration treatment. FALEC increasing PARP1 meditated self PARylation through recruiting ART5 and down regulation of ART5 decreased CRPC cell viability and restored NAD+ through inhibiting PARP1meditated self PARylation in vitro. Furthermore, ART5 was indispensable for FALEC directly interaction and regulation of PARP1, loss of ART5 impaired FALEC and PARP1 associated self PARylation. In vivo, FALEC depleted combined with PARP1 inhibitor decreased CRPC cell derived tumor growth and metastasis in a model of castration treatment NOD/SCID mice. Together, these results established that FALEC may be a novel diagnostic marker for PCa progression and provides a potential new therapeutic strategy to target the FALEC/ART5/PARP1 complex in CRPC patients.""","""['Fei Shi', 'Lei Wu', 'Di Cui', 'Menghao Sun', 'Yuanhao Shen', 'Zheng Zhou', 'Zheng Deng', 'Bangmin Han', 'Shujie Xia', 'Zheng Zhu', 'Feng Sun']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Oncol (Dordr)""","""['The long noncoding RNA HORAS5 mediates castration-resistant prostate cancer survival by activating the androgen receptor transcriptional program.', 'PLCε knockdown enhances the radiosensitivity of castration‑resistant prostate cancer via the AR/PARP1/DNA‑PKcs axis.', 'lncRNA HOXD-AS1 Regulates Proliferation and Chemo-Resistance of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer via Recruiting WDR5.', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Noncoding RNA in the Occurrence of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'The Crosstalk of Long Non-Coding RNA and MicroRNA in Castration-Resistant and Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer: Their Interaction and Clinical Importance.']"""

Although exceptionally described, long-term survivors may develop second primary cancers outside the central nervous system (CNS). Here, a consecutive series explored the association between non-CNS cancers (nCNSc) and GIIG in patients who underwent glioma resection.  Methods:   Inclusion criteria were adult patients operated for a GIIG who experienced nCNSc following cerebral surgery.  Results:   Nineteen patients developed nCNSc after GIIG removal (median time 7.3 years, range 0.6-17.3 years), including breast cancers (n = 6), hematological cancers (n = 2), liposarcomas (n = 2), lung cancers (n = 2), kidney cancers (n = 2), cardia cancers (n = 2), bladder cancer (n = 1), prostate cancer (n = 1) and melanoma (n = 1). The mean extent of GIIG resection was 91.68 ± 6.39%, with no permanent neurological deficit. Fifteen oligodendrogliomas and 4 IDH-mutated astrocytomas were diagnosed. Adjuvant treatment was administrated in 12 patients before nCNSc onset. Moreover, 5 patients underwent reoperation. The median follow-up from initial GIIG surgery was 9.4 years (range 2.3-19.9 years). Nine patients (47%) died in this period. The 7 patients who deceased from the second tumor were significantly older at nCNSc diagnosis than the 2 patients who died from the glioma (p = 0.022), with a longer time between GIIG surgery and the occurrence of nCNSc (p = 0.046).  Conclusion:   This is the first study investigating the combination between GIIG and nCNSc. Because GIIG patients are living longer, the risk to experience second neoplasm and to die from it is increasing, especially in older patients.

Localized prostate cancer was diagnosed in 2664 men. Of these men, 1643 were enrolled in a trial to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments, with 545 randomly assigned to receive active monitoring, 553 to undergo prostatectomy, and 545 to undergo radiotherapy.  Methods:   At a median follow-up of 15 years (range, 11 to 21), we compared the results in this population with respect to death from prostate cancer (the primary outcome) and death from any cause, metastases, disease progression, and initiation of long-term androgen-deprivation therapy (secondary outcomes).  Results:   Follow-up was complete for 1610 patients (98%). A risk-stratification analysis showed that more than one third of the men had intermediate or high-risk disease at diagnosis. Death from prostate cancer occurred in 45 men (2.7%): 17 (3.1%) in the active-monitoring group, 12 (2.2%) in the prostatectomy group, and 16 (2.9%) in the radiotherapy group (P = 0.53 for the overall comparison). Death from any cause occurred in 356 men (21.7%), with similar numbers in all three groups. Metastases developed in 51 men (9.4%) in the active-monitoring group, in 26 (4.7%) in the prostatectomy group, and in 27 (5.0%) in the radiotherapy group. Long-term androgen-deprivation therapy was initiated in 69 men (12.7%), 40 (7.2%), and 42 (7.7%), respectively; clinical progression occurred in 141 men (25.9%), 58 (10.5%), and 60 (11.0%), respectively. In the active-monitoring group, 133 men (24.4%) were alive without any prostate cancer treatment at the end of follow-up. No differential effects on cancer-specific mortality were noted in relation to the baseline PSA level, tumor stage or grade, or risk-stratification score. No treatment complications were reported after the 10-year analysis.  Conclusions:   After 15 years of follow-up, prostate cancer-specific mortality was low regardless of the treatment assigned.

Thirty to forty-seven percent of patients treated with exclusive radiotherapy for prostate cancer will experience intraprostate recurrence. The use of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions allows millimetric accuracy in irradiation to the target zone that minimizes the dose to organs at risk. In this study, we evaluated the clinical outcome of prostatic reirradiation with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) in patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated by radiotherapy.  Method:   This single-center retrospective study included 41 patients diagnosed with exclusive local recurrence of prostate cancer after radiotherapy and treatedby stereotactic Cyberknife irradiation. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy and the safety of stereotactic reirradiation for patients with intraprostatic recurrence initially treated with radiotherapy.  Results:   Median follow-up was 35 months. The 2-year biochemical relapse-free survival was 72.89%, the 2-year local recurrence free survival was 93.59%, the 2-year local regional recurrence-free survival was 85.24%, and the 2-year metastasis-free survival was to 91.49%. The analysis of toxicities showed a good tolerance of stereotactic irradiation. Urinary and gastro-intestinal adverse events was mostly of grades 1-2 (CTCAEv4). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in one to two patients.  Conclusion:   Stereotactic reirradiation appears effective and well-tolerated for local recurrence of prostate cancer and might allow to delay the introduction of hormonal therapy and its side effects.""","""['Sofiane Allali', 'Pierre Loap', 'Jean-Emmanuel Bibault', 'Sarah Krepps', 'Aurelien Deforge', 'Damien Moreau', 'Catherine Durdux', 'Philippe Giraud']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Linac-based stereotactic salvage reirradiation for intraprostatic prostate cancer recurrence: toxicity and outcomes.', 'Salvage prostate re-irradiation using high-dose-rate brachytherapy or focal stereotactic body radiotherapy for local recurrence after definitive radiation therapy.', 'Reirradiation for isolated local recurrence of prostate cancer: Mono-institutional series of 64 patients treated with salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).', 'Salvage reirradiation for local prostate cancer recurrence after radiation therapy.

ITGA8 was positively related to immune checkpoints and immunomodulators, whereas B cell, CD4+ T cell, CD8+ T cell, neutrophil, macrophage, and dendritic cell infiltration had the same correlation. Moreover, ITGA8 was negatively related to cancer stemness. We used an online database to predict the miRNAs and lncRNAs that regulate ITGA8 and obtained the regulatory network of ITGA8 through correlation analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses showed that LINC01798 regulates ITGA8 expression through miR-17-5p. Therefore, the regulatory network of ITGA8 may serve as a new therapeutic target to improve the prognosis of patients with lung cancer.""","""['Xuanguang Li', 'Guangsheng Zhu', 'Yongwen Li', 'Hua Huang', 'Chen Chen', 'Di Wu', 'Peijun Cao', 'Ruifeng Shi', 'Lianchun Su', 'Ruihao Zhang', 'Hongyu Liu', 'Jun Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""['ITGA2B and ITGA8 are predictive of prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients.', 'A novel lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA regulatory network in lung adenocarcinoma and kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma.', 'Construction and investigation of a combined hypoxia and stemness index lncRNA-associated ceRNA regulatory network in lung adenocarcinoma.', 'Six MicroRNA Prognostic Models for Overall Survival of Lung Adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of a Novel Cancer Stemness-Associated ceRNA Axis in Lung Adenocarcinoma via Stemness Indices Analysis.', 'Function and prognostic value of basement membrane -related genes in lung adenocarcinoma.']"""

Advancements in understanding the heterogeneity of prostate cancer will help navigate through these challenges and ultimately benefit patients. In this study, we integrated single-cell sequencing for transposase-accessible chromatin and whole transcriptome in prostate cancer cell lines, aiming to decode the epigenetic plasticity upon enzalutamide (ENZ) treatment. By comparing the cell populations representing early-treatment response or resistance to the initial tumor cells, we identified seven signature gene sets; they present consistent trends of chromatin closing co-occurred with down-regulated genes during early response and chromatin opening with up-regulated genes upon maintaining drug resistance. In the molecular signatures, we found genes ZNF337, MAPK15, and ESRRG are favorable in progression-free prognosis during early response, while genes CCDC150, CCDC18, and POC1A marked poor prognosis underpinning the pre-existing drug resistance in The Cancer Genome Atlas prostate adenocarcinoma cohort. Ultimately, drug-target analyses nominated combinatory drug candidates to either enhance early-treatment response or potentially overcome ENZ resistance. Together, our integrative, single-cell multi-omics approach in pre-clinical models is effective in identifying informative signatures from complex molecular events, illustrating diverse drug responses in prostate cancer, and invoking novel combinatory drug strategies to inform clinical decision making.""","""['Huihui Fan', 'Jinze Li', 'Astrid M Manuel', 'Zhongming Zhao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Ther Nucleic Acids""","""['Single-cell ATAC and RNA sequencing reveal pre-existing and persistent cells associated with prostate cancer relapse.', 'Combination AZD5363 with Enzalutamide Significantly Delays Enzalutamide-resistant Prostate Cancer in Preclinical Models.', 'Identification of Potential Key Genes and Pathways in Enzalutamide-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cell Lines: A Bioinformatics Analysis with Data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database.', 'Systematic Review of Efficacy and Health Economic Implications of Real-world Treatment Sequencing in Prostate Cancer: Where Do the Newer Agents Enzalutamide and Abiraterone Fit in?', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.']"""

Objective:   To study and present estimates of the incidence, mortality, and disability of kidney, bladder, prostate, and testicular cancer by location and age from 1990 to 2019 and reveal the mortality risk factors of them.  Materials:   The Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019 was used to obtain data for this research. The prediction of cancer mortality and incidence was based on mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). The MIR data was processed by logistic regression and adjusted by Gaussian process regression. The association between the socio-demographic index and the incidence or disease burden was determined by Spearman's rank order correlation.  Results:   Globally in 2019, there were 371,700 kidney cancer cases with an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 4.6 per 100,000, 524,300 bladder cancer cases, with an ASIR of 6.5 per 100,000, 1,410,500 prostate cancer cases with an ASIR of 4.6 per 100,000 and 109,300 testicular cancer incident cases with an ASIR of 1.4 per 100,000, the ASIR of these four cancers increased by 29.1, 4, 22, and 45.5% respectively. The incidence rate of the four cancers and the burden of kidney cancer were positively correlated with the socio-demographic index (SDI), regions with a higher SDI faced more of a burden attributable to these four cancers. High body-mass index has surpassed smoking to be the leading risk factor in the past thirty years for kidney cancer mortality. Smoking remained the leading risk factor for cancer-related mortality for bladder cancer and prostate cancer and the only risk factor for prostate cancer. However, the contribution of high fasting plasma glucose to bladder cancer mortality has been increasing.  Conclusion:   The incidence of bladder, kidney, prostate, and testicular cancer is ever-increasing. High-income regions face a greater burden attributable to the four cancers.

NED was evaluated using prostate biopsy samples at the time of mCRPC by immunohistochemical staining. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to assess the association between NED and treatment outcomes including PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and overall survival (OS).  Results:   NED was confirmed in 100/262 (38.2%) mCRPC patients, with 76/100 (76.0%) and 24/100 (24.0%) men harboring NED < 10% and NED ≥ 10%, respectively. 203/262 (77.5%) and 59/262 (22.5%) patients received abiraterone and docetaxel, respectively.

But in prostate cancer (PCa), it appears as a tumor suppressor gene. Recent studies have shown that this may be related to subcellular localization and posttranslational modification. We found that TEAD3 was down-expressed in PCa. Immunohistochemistry of clinical PCa specimens confirmed that TEAD3 expression was the highest in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, followed by primary PCa tissues, and the lowest in metastatic PCa tissues, and its expression level was positively correlated with overall survival. MTT assay, clone formation assay, and scratch assay confirmed that overexpression of TEAD3 could significantly inhibit the proliferation and migration of PCa cells. Next-generation sequencing results indicated that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway was significantly inhibited after overexpression of TEAD3. Rescue assays suggested that ADRBK2 could reverse the proliferation and migration ability caused by overexpression of TEAD3. TEAD3 is downregulated in PCa and associated with poor patient prognosis. Overexpression of TEAD3 inhibits the proliferation and migration ability of PCa cells via restraining the mRNA level of ADRBK2.

The sensing electrode was prepared by sputtering a gold film on shrink polymer, followed by heating to shrink the electrode to a small size with wrinkles from nano-scale to micro-scale. These wrinkles can be directly regulated by the thickness of the gold film with high specific areas for enhancement of antigen-antibody binding (3.9 times).

LMD-LC-MS/MS revealed enrichment for the C-terminal portion of growth and differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) in prostatic crystalloids. Although urinary GDF15 levels were higher in patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma compared to those without (median: 1561.2 versus 1101.3, arbitrary units), this did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.07).

The purpose of this study is to use in silico computation, i.e., molecular docking to facilitate the identification of environmental androgens. Computational docking was used to study the binding interactions of environmental/industrial compounds with the three dimensional structure of human androgen receptor (AR). Then reporter assay and cell proliferation assay using AR-expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells were used to determine their in vitro androgenic activity. Animal studies using immature male rats were also carried out to test their in vivo androgenic activity. Two novel environmental androgens were identified. As a photoinitiator, 2-benzyl-2-(dimethylamino)-4'-morpholinobutyrophenone (Irgacure 369, abbreviated as IC-369) is widely used in the packaging and electronics industries. Galaxolide (HHCB) is widely used in the production of perfume, fabric softeners and detergents. We found that both IC-369 and HHCB could activate AR transcriptional activity and promote cell proliferation in AR-sensitive LNCaP cells. Furthermore, IC-369 and HHCB could induce cell proliferation and histological changes of seminal vesicles in immature rats. RNA sequencing and qPCR analysis showed that androgen-related genes in seminal vesicle tissue were up-regulated by IC-369 and HHCB. In conclusion, IC-369 and HHCB are new environmental androgens that bind AR and induce AR transcriptional activity, thereby exerting toxicological effects on the development of male reproductive organs.""","""['Mingzhao Li', 'Ren Wang', 'Pan Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Chemosphere""","""['Environmental (anti-)androgenic chemicals affect germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) of Xenopus laevis oocytes in vitro.', 'Structure-based discovery of the endocrine disrupting effects of hydraulic fracturing chemicals as novel androgen receptor antagonists.', 'Exposure of androgen mimicking environmental chemicals enhances proliferation of prostate cancer (LNCaP) cells by inducing AR expression and epigenetic modifications.', 'Disruption of androgen receptor signaling in males by environmental chemicals.', 'Androgen action in the prostate gland.']"""

Methods:   Forty suspected prostatic cancer patients underwent DWI with or without RDC (i.e. RDC DWI or DWI) using a 3 T MR system as well as pathological examinations. The pathological examination results indicated 86 areas were malignant while 86 out of 394 areas were computationally selected as benign. SNR for benign areas and muscle and ADCs for malignant and benign areas were determined by ROI measurements on each DWI. Moreover, overall image quality was assessed with a 5-point visual scoring system on each DWI. Paired t-test or Wilcoxon's signed rank test was performed to compare SNR and overall image quality for DWIs. ROC analysis was then used to compare the diagnostic performance, and sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP) and accuracy (AC) of ADC were compared between two DWI by means of McNemar's test.

Materials and methods:   We prospectively included 163 eligible patients with late-stage cancer of any diagnosis from June 2020 to May 2022 in the Proseq Cancer trial. Molecular profiling of new or fresh frozen tumor biopsies was done by WES and RNAseq with parallel sequencing of non-tumoral DNA as individual reference. Cases were presented at a National Molecular Tumor Board (NMTB) for discussion of targeted treatment. Subsequently, patients were followed for at least 7 months.  Results:   80% (N = 131) of patients had a successful analysis done, disclosing at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 96%. A strongly or potentially druggable variant was found in 19% and 73% of patients, respectively. A germline variant was identified in 2.5%. Median time from trial inclusion to NMTB decision was one month. One third (N = 44) of patients who underwent molecularly profiling were matched with a targeted treatment, however, only 16% were either treated (N = 16) or are waiting for treatment (N = 5), deteriorating performance status being the primary cause of failure. A history of cancer among 1st degree relatives, and a diagnosis of lung or prostate cancer correlated with greater chance of targeted treatment being available. The response rate of targeted treatments was 40%, the clinical benefit rate 53%, and the median time on treatment was 3.8 months. 23% of patients presented at NMTB were recommended clinical trial participation, not dependent on biomarkers.

Although shown to be life-prolonging in patients with mCRPC, the treatment procedures associated with these radiopharmaceuticals can be challenging for both patients and hospitals. This study investigates the costs of mCRPC treatment in Dutch hospitals for currently reimbursed radiopharmaceuticals with a demonstrated overall survival benefit.  Methods:   A cost model that calculated the direct medical per-patient costs of radium-223 and 177Lu-PSMA-I&T was developed, following clinical trial regimens. The model considered six 4-weekly administrations (i.e. ALSYMPCA regimen) of radium-223. Regarding 177Lu-PSMA-I&T, the model used both the VISION regimen (i.e. five 6-weekly administrations) and the SPLASH regimen (i.e. four 8-weekly administrations). Based on health insurance claims, we also estimated the coverage a hospital would receive for providing treatment. No fitting health insurance claim for 177Lu-PSMA-I&T is currently available; therefore, we calculated a break-even value for a potential health insurance claim that would exactly counterbalance the per-patient costs and coverage.  Results:   Radium-223 administration is associated with per-patient costs of €30,905, and these costs are fully covered by the coverage a hospital receives. The per-patient costs of 177Lu-PSMA-I&T range between €35,866 and €47,546 per administration period, depending on the regimen. Current healthcare insurance claims do not fully cover the costs of providing 177Lu-PSMA-I&T: hospitals must pay €4,414-€4,922 for each patient out of their own budget. The break-even value for the potential insurance claim covering 177Lu-PSMA-I&T administration with a VISION (SPLASH) regimen is €1,073 (€1,215).  Conclusion:   This study shows that, without consideration of the treatment effect, radium-223 treatment for mCRPC leads to lower per-patient costs than treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-I&T.

Methods:   The study included patients from a pooled cohort (n = 1223) of 11 centers from 6 countries. Patients with PSA levels > 0.2 ng/ml prior to sRT or without sRT to the prostatic fossa were excluded. The primary study endpoint was biochemical recurrence-free survival (BRFS) and BR was defined as PSA nadir after sRT + 0.2 ng/ml. Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of clinical parameters on BRFS. Recurrence patterns after sRT were analyzed.  Results:   The final cohort consisted of 273 patients; 78/273 (28.6%) and 48/273 (17.6%) patients had local or nodal recurrence on PET/CT. The most frequently applied sRT dose to the prostatic fossa was 66-70 Gy (n = 143/273, 52.4%).

Methods:   WDR3 gene expression levels were obtained by analyzing databases and our clinical specimens. The expression levels of genes and proteins were determined by a real-time polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Cell-counting kit-8 assays were used to measure the proliferation of PCa cells. Cell transfection was used to investigate the role of WDR3 and USF2 in PCa. Fluorescence reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were used to detect USF2 binding to the promoter region of RASSF1A. Mouse experiments were used to confirm the mechanism in vivo.  Results:   By analyzing the database and our clinical specimens, we found that WDR3 expression was significantly increased in PCa tissues. Overexpression of WDR3 enhanced PCa cell proliferation, decreased cell apoptosis rate, increased spherical cell number and increased indicators of stem cell-like properties. However, these effects were reversed by WDR3 knockdown. WDR3 was negatively correlated with USF2, which was degraded by promoting ubiquitination of USF2, and USF2 interacted with promoter region-binding elements of RASSF1A to depress PCa stemness and growth. In vivo studies showed that WDR3 knockdown reduced tumor size and weight, reduced cell proliferation and enhanced cell apoptosis.

Purpose:   To develop and evaluate a mutually communicated deep learning segmentation and classification network (MC-DSCN) based on mp-MRI for prostate segmentation and PCa diagnosis.  Methods:   The proposed MC-DSCN can transfer mutual information between segmentation and classification components and facilitate each other in a bootstrapping way. For classification task, the MC-DSCN can transfer the masks produced by the coarse segmentation component to the classification component to exclude irrelevant regions and facilitate classification. For segmentation task, this model can transfer the high-quality localization information learned by the classification component to the fine segmentation component to mitigate the impact of inaccurate localization on segmentation results. Consecutive MRI exams of patients were retrospectively collected from two medical centers (referred to as center A and B). Two experienced radiologists segmented the prostate regions, and the ground truth of the classification refers to the prostate biopsy results. MC-DSCN was designed, trained, and validated using different combinations of distinct MRI sequences as input (e.g., T2-weighted and apparent diffusion coefficient) and the effect of different architectures on the network's performance was tested and discussed. Data from center A were used for training, validation, and internal testing, while another center's data were used for external testing. The statistical analysis is performed to evaluate the performance of the MC-DSCN. The DeLong test and paired t-test were used to assess the performance of classification and segmentation, respectively.  Results:   In total, 134 patients were included. The proposed MC-DSCN outperforms the networks that were designed solely for segmentation or classification. Regarding the segmentation task, the classification localization information helped to improve the IOU in center A: from 84.5% to 87.8% (p < 0.01) and in center B: from 83.8% to 87.1% (p < 0.01), while the area under curve (AUC) of PCa classification was improved in center A: from 0.946 to 0.991 (p < 0.02) and in center B: from 0.926 to 0.955 (p < 0.01) as a result of the additional information provided by the prostate segmentation.

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a propensity score-matched population-based cohort study to compare the overall survival of cancer patients with and without sarcopenia.  Patients and methods:   In our study, we included patients with cancer and divided them into two groups based on the presence or absence of sarcopenia. To ensure comparability between the groups, we matched patients in both groups at a ratio of 1:1.  Results:   After the matching process, our final cohort included 20,416 patients with cancer (10,208 in each group) who were eligible for further analysis. There were no significant differences between the sarcopenia and nonsarcopenia groups in terms of confounding factors such as age (mean 61.05 years versus 62.17 years), gender (52.56% versus 52.16% male, 47.44% versus 47.84% female), comorbidities, and cancer stages. In our multivariate Cox regression analysis, we found that the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) of all-cause death for the sarcopenia group compared to the nonsarcopenia group was 1.49 (1.43-1.55; p < 0.001). Additionally, the aHRs (95% CIs) of all-cause death for those aged 66-75, 76-85, and >85 years (compared to those aged ≤65 years) were 1.29 (1.23-1.36), 2.00 (1.89-2.12), and 3.26 (2.97-3.59), respectively.

GLC-MS analysis of the seeds' oil showed a high concentration of omega-3 fatty acid, with a percentage of 35.64% of the total fatty acid content in the seed oil. The biological results revealed that the dichloromethane fraction showed promising DPPH radical-scavenging activity (IC50 = 14.73 µg/mL), antidiabetic activity with significant inhibition of the α-amylase enzyme (IC50 673.25 μg/mL), and anti-inflammatory activity using in vitro histamine release assay (IC50 61.8 μg/mL). Furthermore, the dichloromethane fraction revealed moderate cytotoxic activity against human lung cancer cell line (A-549), human prostate carcinoma (PC-3), and colon carcinoma (HCT-116) with IC50s 35.9 ± 2.1 μg/mL, 42.4 ± 2.3 μg/mL, and 47.5 ± 1.3 μg/mL, respectively, and antiobesity activity with IC50 59.3 μg/mL, using pancreatic lipase inhibitory assay. In conclusion, this study's findings not only shed light on the phytochemical constituents and biological activities of the non-polar fractions of chia but also should be taken as a basis for the future in vivo and clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of chia and its extracts. Further study should be focused towards the isolation of the active principles of the dichloromethane fraction and studying their efficacy, exact mechanism(s), and safety, which could benefit the pharmaceutical industry and folk medicine practitioners who use this plant to cure diseases.""","""['Afaf E Abdel Ghani', 'Muneera S M Al-Saleem', 'Wael M Abdel-Mageed', 'Ehsan M AbouZeid', 'Marwa Y Mahmoud', 'Rehab H Abdallah']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Plants (Basel)""","""['Chia Seeds (Salvia hispanica L.): An Overview-Phytochemical Profile, Isolation Methods, and Application.', 'Omega-3 fatty acids and oxidative stability of ice cream supplemented with olein fraction of chia (Salvia hispanica L.) oil.', 'Fatty acids characterization, oxidative perspectives and consumer acceptability of oil extracted from pre-treated chia (Salvia hispanica L.) seeds.', 'Volatile and phenolic profiling of a traditional medicinal plant, Hypericum empetrifolium with in vitro biological activities.', 'The Current State of Knowledge on Salvia hispanica and Salviae hispanicae semen (Chia Seeds).', 'Nutritional and Functional New Perspectives and Potential Health Benefits of Quinoa and Chia Seeds.']"""

On the other hand, the therapeutic potential of estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) has been implicated in many diseases including prostate cancer, and this target has attracted intensive attention recently. In this work, we report the development of the first H2O2-triggered ERβ-targeted near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) probe and its application in imaging of prostate cancer both in vitro and in vivo. The probe showed good ERβ selective binding affinity, excellent H2O2 responsiveness and near infrared imaging potential. Moreover, in vivo and ex vivo imaging studies indicated that the probe could selectively bind to DU-145 prostate cancer cells and rapidly visualizes H2O2 in DU-145 xenograft tumors. Mechanistic studies such as high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that the borate ester group is vital for the H2O2 response turn-on fluorescence of the probe.

Recent antitumor therapies include compounds with the ability to influence immune cells on the tumor microenvironment, with immunotherapy being one actual goal in cancer treatment. Therefore, the effect of chalcone 16 on the expression of mTOR, HIF-1α, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β, after THP-1 macrophage stimulation (none, LPS or IL-4), was evaluated. Chalcone 16 significantly increased the expression of mTORC1, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10 of IL-4 stimulated macrophages (that induces an M2 phenotype). HIF-1α and TGF-β were not significantly affected. Chalcone 16 also decreased nitric oxide production by the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line, this effect probably being due to an inhibition of iNOS expression.

Currently, chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of cancers, including PCa, mainly inhibit tumor growth by apoptosis induction. However, defects in apoptotic cellular responses frequently lead to drug resistance, which is the main cause of chemotherapy failure. For this reason, trigger non-apoptotic cell death might represent an alternative approach to prevent drug resistance in cancer. Several agents, including natural compounds, have been shown to induce necroptosis in human cancer cells. In this study we evaluated the involvement of necroptosis in anticancer activity of delta-tocotrienol (δ-TT) in PCa cells (DU145 and PC3). Combination therapy is one tool used to overcome therapeutic resistance and drug toxicity. Evaluating the combined effect of δ-TT and docetaxel (DTX), we found that δ-TT potentiates DTX cytotoxicity in DU145 cells. Moreover, δ-TT induces cell death in DU145 cells that have developed DTX resistance (DU-DXR) activating necroptosis. Taken together, obtained data indicate the ability of δ-TT to induce necroptosis in both DU145, PC3 and DU-DXR cell lines.

It is necessary to establish a genetic signature associated with AKR1C3 that can be used to predict the prognosis of PCa patients and provide important information for clinical treatment decisions. AKR1C3-related genes were identified via label-free quantitative proteomics of the AKR1C3-overexpressing LNCaP cell line. A risk model was constructed through the analysis of clinical data, PPI, and Cox-selected risk genes. Cox regression analysis, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to verify the accuracy of the model, and two external datasets were used to verify the reliability of the results. Subsequently, the tumor microenvironment and drug sensitivity were explored. Moreover, the roles of AKR1C3 in the progression of PCa were verified in LNCaP cells. MTT, colony formation, and EdU assays were conducted to explore cell proliferation and drug sensitivity to enzalutamide. Migration and invasion abilities were measured using wound-healing and transwell assays, and qPCR was used to assess the expression levels of AR target genes and EMT genes. CDC20, SRSF3, UQCRH, INCENP, TIMM10, TIMM13, POLR2L, and NDUFAB1 were identified as AKR1C3-associated risk genes. These risk genes, established using the prognostic model, can effectively predict the recurrence status, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity of PCa. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and several immune checkpoints that promote cancer progression were higher in high-risk groups. Furthermore, there was a close correlation between the sensitivity of PCa patients to bicalutamide and docetaxel and the expression levels of the eight risk genes. Moreover, through in vitro experiments, Western blotting confirmed that AKR1C3 enhanced SRSF3, CDC20, and INCENP expression. We found that PCa cells with a high expression of AKR1C3 have high proliferation ability and high migration ability and were insensitive to enzalutamide. AKR1C3-associated genes had a significant role in the process of PCa, immune responses, and drug sensitivity and offer the potential for a novel model for prognostic prediction in PCa.""","""['Xiaoli Cui', 'Changcheng Li', 'Jipeng Ding', 'Zhou Yao', 'Tianyu Zhao', 'Jiahui Guo', 'Yaru Wang', 'Jing Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Overexpression of aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) in LNCaP cells diverts androgen metabolism towards testosterone resulting in resistance to the 5α-reductase inhibitor finasteride.', 'AKR1C3, a crucial androgenic enzyme in prostate cancer, promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis through activating ERK signaling.', 'Cancer-associated fibroblasts promote prostate tumor growth and progression through upregulation of cholesterol and steroid biosynthesis.', 'A Mansonone Derivative Coupled with Monoclonal Antibody 4D5-Modified Chitosan Inhibit AKR1C3 to Treat Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'AKR1C3 as a target in castrate resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Data were extracted from the medical records of 214 men with prostate cancer who underwent RARP from 2019 to 2021. We then calculated the number of days elapsed from the surgery to the initial outpatient visit confirming PUI recovery among the patients. We estimated the PUI recovery rate using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and evaluated associated factors using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   The PUI recovery rates were 5.7%, 23.4%, 64.6%, and 93.3% at 30, 90, 180, and 365 days following RARP, respectively. After an adjustment, those with preoperative urinary incontinence experienced significantly slower PUI recovery than their counterparts, while those with bilateral nerve sparing experienced recovery significantly sooner than those with no nerve sparing.

Because a genomic analysis of pancreas tissue revealed that it may take years, if not decades, for pancreatic cancer to develop, we performed radiomics and fat fraction analysis on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans of patients with historical scans showing no evidence of cancer but who subsequently went on to develop pancreas cancer years later, in an attempt to identify specific imaging features of the normal pancreas that may portend the subsequent development of the cancer. In this IRB-exempt, retrospective, single institution study, CECT chest, abdomen, and pelvis (CAP) scans of 22 patients who had evaluable historical imaging data were analyzed. The images from the ""healthy"" pancreas were obtained between 3.8 and 13.9 years before the diagnosis of pancreas cancer was established. Afterwards, the images were used to divide and draw seven regions of interest (ROIs) around the pancreas (uncinate, head, neck-genu, body (proximal, middle, and distal) and tail). Radiomic analysis on these pancreatic ROIs consisted of first order quantitative texture analysis features such as kurtosis, skewness, and fat quantification. Of all the variables tested, fat fraction in the pancreas tail (p = 0.029) and asymmetry of the histogram frequency curve (skewness) of pancreas tissue (p = 0.038) were identified as the most important imaging signatures for subsequent cancer development. Changes in the texture of the pancreas as measured on the CECT of patients who developed pancreas cancer years later could be identified, confirming the utility of radiomics-based imaging as a potential predictor of oncologic outcomes. Such findings may be potentially useful in the future to screen patients for pancreatic cancer, thereby helping detect pancreas cancer at an early stage and improving survival.""","""['Ronald Lee Korn', 'Andre Burkett', 'Jeff Geschwind', 'Dominic Zygadlo', 'Taylor Brodie', 'Derek Cridebring', 'Daniel D Von Hoff', 'Michael J Demeure']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Diagnostics (Basel)""","""['Radiomic feature reproducibility in contrast-enhanced CT of the pancreas is affected by variabilities in scan parameters and manual segmentation.', 'Compute Tomography Radiomics Analysis on Whole Pancreas Between Healthy Individual and Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Patients: Uncertainty Analysis and Predictive Modeling.', 'Radiomics-Based Texture Analysis of 68Ga-DOTATATE Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography Images as a Prognostic Biomarker in Adults With Neuroendocrine Cancers Treated With 177Lu-DOTATATE.', 'Pancreas image mining: a systematic review of radiomics.', 'CT and MRI of pancreatic tumors: an update in the era of radiomics.']"""

The analytical strengths and limitations were explored, finally focusing on the unbiased detection of proteoforms, exemplified by discovering a prostate cancer-related cleavage product of pyruvate kinase M2. Label-free shotgun proteomics quickly yields an annotated proteome but with reduced robustness, as determined by three times higher technical variation compared to 2D-DIGE. At a glance, only 2D-DIGE top-down analysis provided valuable, direct stoichiometric qualitative and quantitative information from proteins to their proteoforms, even with unexpected post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic cleavage and phosphorylation.

Conclusion:   Men with prostate cancer have positive experiences toward the use of a holistic multidisciplinary approach (ie, clinical pathway) to combat androgen deprivation therapy-induced side effects in practice. Patients identified several key ingredients of the pathway, such as peer support, physiotherapist involvement, and availability of a multidisciplinary team. Patients were, however, reluctant to continue the exercise component at home because of negative attitudes toward a public gym, practical issues, absence of known facilitators, and other priorities.  Implications for nursing practice:   Referral by a health care provider remains an important motivator for pathway participation. Peer support, physiotherapist involvement, and availability of a multidisciplinary team are crucial components of the clinical pathway and should be taken into account when developing and implementing similar pathways to increase program uptake in daily practice.""","""['Renée Bultijnck', 'Elke Rammant', 'Anneleen Raes', 'Nathalie Vandecasteele', 'Karel Decaestecker', 'Valérie Fonteyne', 'Nicolaas Lumen', 'Piet Ost', 'Benedicte Deforche']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Semin Oncol Nurs""","""['Exercise as a supportive care strategy in men with prostate cancer receiving androgen deprivation therapy at a regional cancer centre: a survey of patients and clinicians.', '""Kicked out into the real world"": prostate cancer patients\' experiences with transitioning from hospital-based supervised exercise to unsupervised exercise in the community.', 'Improving Physical and Mental Health in Patients with Prostate Cancer Undergoing Androgen Deprivation Therapy: Strategies to Promote and Improve Physical Activity Quality and Quantity.', 'Clinical pathway improves implementation of evidence-based strategies for the management of androgen deprivation therapy-induced side effects in men with prostate cancer.', 'Nursing Considerations for Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Bone Health in Men Affected by Prostate Cancer.']"""

Artificial intelligence assessment of %GP4 may improve its accuracy and reproducibility and provide information for prognosis prediction. To investigate this potential, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained to objectively identify and quantify Gleason pattern (GP) 3 and 4 areas, estimate %GP4, and assess whether CNN-predicted %GP4 is associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) risk in intermediate-risk GG 2 and 3 tumors. The study was conducted in a radical prostatectomy cohort (1999-2012) of African American men from the Henry Ford Health System (Detroit, Michigan). A CNN model that could discriminate 4 tissue types (stroma, benign glands, GP3 glands, and GP4 glands) was developed using histopathologic images containing GG 1 (n = 45) and 4 (n = 20) tumor foci. The CNN model was applied to GG 2 (n = 153) and 3 (n = 62) tumors for %GP4 estimation, and Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to assess the association of %GP4 and BCR, accounting for other clinicopathologic features including GG. The CNN model achieved an overall accuracy of 86% in distinguishing the 4 tissue types. Furthermore, CNN-predicted %GP4 was significantly higher in GG 3 than in GG 2 tumors (P = 7.2 × 10-11). %GP4 was associated with an increased risk of BCR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.09 per 10% increase in %GP4; P = .010) in GG 2 and 3 tumors. Within GG 2 tumors specifically, %GP4 was more strongly associated with BCR (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.12; P = .006). Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of CNN-predicted %GP4 estimation, which is associated with BCR risk.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of hypocretin-1 on glioblastoma proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion and its mechanism. We found that the hypocretin-1 receptor was expressed in both glioma cell lines and glioma tissues. Hypocretin-1 treatment can inhibit glioblastoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and induce cell apoptosis. Meanwhile, hypocretin-1 treatment significantly reduces tumor growth rate and tumor weight. In addition, mechanistic studies have found that hypocretin-1 exerts antitumor effects by inhibiting NOTCH signaling pathway.

PCa cell proliferative potential, migratory potential, and apoptosis in vitro were determined using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU incorporation, wound healing, and apoptosis assays. Proliferation and migratory potential were impaired and apoptosis was induced in PCa cells cultured with the conditioned medium from KMT2D-depleted cells. Cytokine array analysis showed that IL-6 was the most affected cytokine in the conditioned media. KMT2D knockdown significantly downregulated the expression of IL-6 in PCa cells. What's more, proliferation and migration were also impaired and apoptosis was also induced by silencing IL-6R expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) were performed to validate the positive correlation between KMT2D and IL-6 in PCa tissue samples. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR demonstrated that KMT2D and H3K4me1 occupied IL-6 enhancer regions and therefore, directly regulated IL-6 expression.

There is still no available strong data regarding the impact of early decline of prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) in the overall survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efﬁcacy of an early prostate-speciﬁc antigen response as a predictor of overall survival (OS) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer when treated with Abiraterone Acetate.  Materials and methods:   A dual center, retrospective, cohort study on patients diagnosed with mCRPC treated with abiraterone between 2013 and 2020 was performed. Primary end-point was to demonstrate the efﬁcacy of AA, with the analysis of PSA decline, and the correlation with overall survival.  Results:   The cohort analysis consisted of 84 patients with a median age of 71 ± 9 years. A PSA response of > 30% and > 50% at 60 and 90 days was associated with improved OS. Multivariate analysis revealed that a 60 day PSA decline of > 30% was predictive of overall survival. Median OS of diag-nosed mCRPC patients was 28 months. Docetaxel pre-treatment was not associated with longer OS. The median duration of drug exposure for patients submitted to AA was found to be 14 months.  Conclusions:   Early PSA response rate can offer clinically meaningful information and can be considered a surrogate of longer OS.

We analyzed the impact of (i) rising serum CGA and (ii) baseline CGA/PSA ratio during treatment to identify associations with abiraterone acetate (AA) therapy.  Methods:   Between June 2013 and August 2015, 92 men with mCRPC were enrolled in a prospective trial with uniform serum CGA processing performed before initiating abiraterone acetate/prednisone (AA/P) and serially after 12 weeks of AA/P treatments. Serum CGA was measured using a homogenous automated immunofluorescent assay. Patients receiving proton pump inhibitors or with abnormal renal function were excluded due to possible false elevations of serum CGA (n = 21 excluded), therefore 71 patients were analyzed. All patients underwent a composite response assessment at 12-weeks. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox Regression models were used to calculate the association with time-to-treatment failure analyses and overall survival.  Results:   An increase in chromogranin was associated with a lower risk of treatment failure (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.52, p = 0.0181). The median CGA/PSA ratio was 7.8 (2.6-16.0) and an elevated pretreatment CGA/PSA ratio above the median was associated with a lower risk of treatment failure (HR: 0.54 p value = 0.0185). An increase in CGA was not found to be associated with OS (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.42-1.21, p = 0.207). An elevated baseline CGA/PSA ratio was not associated with OS (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.37-1.03, p = 0.062).

Immune subversion by metastatic tumours can be achieved through several mechanisms; one of the most frequently observed involves the loss of expression or mutation of genes composing the MHC-I antigen presentation machinery (APM) that yields tumours invisible to Cytotoxic T lymphocytes, the key component of the adaptive cellular immune response. Fascinating ethnographic and experimental findings indicate that cannabinoids inhibit the growth and progression of several categories of cancer; however, the mechanisms underlying these observations remain clouded in uncertainty. Here, we screened a library of cannabinoid compounds and found molecular selectivity amongst specific cannabinoids, where related molecules such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabigerol can reverse the metastatic immune escape phenotype in vitro by inducing MHC-I cell surface expression in a wide variety of metastatic tumours that subsequently sensitizing tumours to T lymphocyte recognition. Remarkably, H3K27Ac ChIPseq analysis established that cannabigerol and gamma interferon induce overlapping epigenetic signatures and key gene pathways in metastatic tumours related to cellular senescence, as well as APM genes involved in revealing metastatic tumours to the adaptive immune response. Overall, the data suggest that specific cannabinoids may have utility in cancer immunotherapy regimens by overcoming immune escape and augmenting cancer immune surveillance in metastatic disease.

The inherent biological heterogeneity of neuroendocrine and prostate cancers may make the prospect of establishing cohort-based dose-response relationships unobtainable. Instead, an individual-based approach, monitoring the dose-response within each tumor could provide the necessary metric to monitor treatment efficacy. Methods: We developed a dual isotope SPECT imaging strategy to monitor the change over time in the relationship between 177Lu-DOTATATE and 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT, a modified radiolabelled antibody that allows imaging of DNA double strand breaks, in mice bearing rat pancreatic cancer xenografts. The dynamics of γH2AX foci, apoptosis and senescence following exposure to 177Lu-DOTATATE was further investigated in vitro and in ex vivo tumor sections. Results: The change in slope of the 111In-anti-γH2AX-TAT to 177Lu signal between days 5 and 7 was found to be highly predictive of survival (r = 0.955, P < 0.0001). This pivotal timeframe was investigated further in vitro: clonogenic survival correlated with the number of γH2AX foci at day 6 (r = -0.995, P < 0.0005). While there was evidence of continuously low levels of apoptosis, delayed induction of senescence in vitro appeared to better account for the γH2AX response to 177Lu. The induction of senescence was further investigated by ex vivo analysis and corresponded with sustained retention of 177Lu within tumor regions. Conclusions: Dual isotope SPECT imaging can provide individualized tumor dose-responses that can be used to predict lutetium-177 treatment efficacy. This bio-dosimeter metric appears to be dependent upon the extent of senescence induction and suggests an integral role that senescence plays in lutetium-177 treatment efficacy.""","""[""Edward O'Neill"", 'Michael Mosley', 'Bart Cornelissen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Imaging DNA Damage Repair In Vivo After 177Lu-DOTATATE Therapy.', 'Preclinical efficacy of hK2 targeted 177Luhu11B6 for prostate cancer theranostics.', '89Zr-PET imaging of DNA double-strand breaks for the early monitoring of response following α- and β-particle radioimmunotherapy in a mouse model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.', 'Lutetium-labelled peptides for therapy of neuroendocrine tumours.', 'Lutetium-177-labelled anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody and ligands for the treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Here, we identified that RNase H2 subunit A (RNASEH2A), a component of RNase H2, is highly expressed in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) tissues compared with localized prostate cancer. Interestingly, we showed that RNASEH2A suppressed R-loop levels to prevent cell apoptosis induced by DNA damage in prostate cancer cells. Both in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that RNASEH2A promotes cell growth and migration via the negative regulation of p53 and positive regulation of AR and AR-V7. Mechanistically, epigenetic regulation followed by R-loop accumulation in these promoters was observed for these gene regulations. Importantly, IHC analysis demonstrated that R-loop formation increased in CRPC tissues and correlated with RNASEH2A expression levels. Notably, two small molecules targeting RNase H2 activity were found to suppress CRPC tumor growth with no significant toxic effects. Collectively, we propose that RNASEH2A overexpression is a hallmark of prostate cancer progression by maintaining genomic stability to prevent R-loop-mediated apoptosis induction. Targeting RNase H2 activity could be a potential strategy for treating CRPC tumors.

Paradoxically, activation of AR can also inhibit the growth of prostate cancer in some patients and experimental systems, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly understood. This study exploited a potent synthetic androgen, methyltestosterone (MeT), to investigate AR agonist-induced growth inhibition. MeT strongly inhibited growth of prostate cancer cells expressing AR, but not AR-negative models. Genes and pathways regulated by MeT were highly analogous to those regulated by DHT, although MeT induced a quantitatively greater androgenic response in prostate cancer cells. MeT potently downregulated DNA methyltransferases, leading to global DNA hypomethylation. These epigenomic changes were associated with dysregulation of transposable element expression, including upregulation of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts after sustained MeT treatment. Increased ERV expression led to accumulation of double-stranded RNA and a ""viral mimicry"" response characterized by activation of IFN signaling, upregulation of MHC class I molecules, and enhanced recognition of murine prostate cancer cells by CD8+ T cells. Positive associations between AR activity and ERVs/antiviral pathways were evident in patient transcriptomic data, supporting the clinical relevance of our findings.

NG samples were collected from six sites in central and southwest Nigeria. After whole-exome sequencing, samples were processed using GATK best practices. BRCA1 (100%), BARD1 (45%), BRCA2 (27%), and PMS2(18%) had germline alterations in at least two NG nontumor samples. Across 111 germline variants, the AA cohort reflected a pattern [BRCA1 (68%), BARD1 (34%), BRCA2 (28%), and PMS2 (16%)] similar to NG samples. Of the most frequently mutated genes, BRCA1 showed a statistically (P ≤ 0.05) higher germline mutation frequency in men of African ancestry (MAA) and increasing variant frequency with increased African ancestry. Disaggregating gene-level mutation frequencies by variants revealed both ancestry-linked and NG-specific germline variant patterns. Driven by rs799917 (T>C), BRCA1 showed an increasing mutation frequency as African ancestry increased. BRCA2_rs11571831 was present only in MAA, and BRCA2_rs766173 was elevated in NG men. A total of 133 somatic variants were present in 26 prostate cancer-associated genes within the NG tumor cohort. BRCA2 (27%), APC (20%), ATM (20%), BRCA1 (13%), DNAJC6 (13%), EGFR (13%), MAD1L1 (13%), MLH1 (11%), and PMS2 (11%) showed mutation frequencies >10%. Compared with TCGA cohorts, NG tumors showed statistically significant elevated frequencies of BRCA2, APC, and BRCA1. The NG cohort variant pattern shared similarities (cosign similarities ≥0.734) with Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer signatures 5 and 6, and mutated genes showed significant (q < 0.001) gene ontology (GO) and functional enrichment in mismatch repair and non-homologous repair deficiency pathways. Here, we showed that mutations in DNA damage response genes were higher in NG prostate cancer samples and that a portion of those mutations correlate with African ancestry. Moreover, we identified variants of unknown significance that may contribute to population-specific routes of tumorigenesis and treatment. These results present the most comprehensive characterization of the NG prostate cancer exome to date and highlight the need to increase diversity of study populations.

Despite the prevalence of other cancers in males and females, genital cancers are especially important because of their psychological effects on individuals. Currently, cervical cancer, corpus uteri neoplasm, and ovarian cancer are the most common gynecological cancers in Iran. Prostate cancer has increased in Iranian men in the last decade. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the 15-year national trend in the incidence of genital cancers in the Iranian population.  Methods:   In this study, we used Iranian cancer registration data collected by the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, demographic information from the reports of the Statistics Center of Iran, STEPs (STEPwise approach to non-communicable diseases risk factor surveillance), and Caspian (childhood and adolescence surveillance and prevention of adult non-communicable disease). A list of potential auxiliary variables and secondary variables at all levels of the province-age-sex were evaluated during the years. We used mixed-effects Poisson regression to model the data and calculate the incidence of each cancer.  Results:   Our results show an enhancement in the outbreak of all types of male cancers, but the most important are prostate (11.46 in 2005 to 25.67 in 2020 per 100,000 males) and testicular cancers (2.39 in 2005 to 5.05 per 100,000 males). As for female cancers, there has been an increase in ovarian and corpus uteri neoplasm incidence with 6.69 and 4.14 incidences per 100,000 females in 2020, making them the most occurring female genital neoplasms. While the occurrence of cervical cancer has decreased over the years (4.65 in 2005 to 3.24 in 2020). In general, the incidence of genital cancers in men and women has amplified in the last 15 years.  Conclusions:   Our study examined the trend of change for each malignant genital neoplasm for 15 years in Iranian men and women in each province. Considering the growing trend of the elderly population in Iran, patient awareness and early screening are essential in reducing mortality and costs imposed on patients and the health care system.""","""['Gita Shafiee', 'Amir-Hossein Mousavian', 'Ali Sheidaei', 'Mehdi Ebrahimi', 'Fatemeh Khatami', 'Kimiya Gohari', 'Mohammad Jabbari', 'Ali Ghanbari-Motlagh', 'Afshin Ostovar', 'Seyed Mohammad Kazem Aghamir', 'Ramin Heshmat']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Public Health""","""['The 15-year national trends of endocrine cancers incidence among Iranian men and women; 2005-2020.', 'National and Subnational Trends of Incidence and Mortality of Female Genital Cancers in Iran; 1990-2016.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Epidemiology of cervical cancer and human papilloma virus infection among Iranian women - analyses of national data and systematic review of the literature.', 'Five common cancers in Iran.']"""

We previously demonstrated the ability of the CTRP8-RXFP1 interaction to promote motility, matrix invasion, and drug resistance. The lack of specific tools to detect CTRP8 protein severely limits our knowledge on CTRP8 biological functions in normal and tumor tissues. Here, we have generated and characterized the first specific antiserum to human CTRP8 which identified CTRP8 as a novel marker of tryptase+ mast cells (MCT) in normal human tissues and in the prostate cancer (PC) microenvironment. Using human PC tissue microarrays composed of neoplastic and corresponding tumor-adjacent prostate tissues, we have identified a significantly higher number of CTRP8+ MCT in the peritumor versus intratumor compartment of PC tissues of Gleason scores 6 and 7. Higher numbers of CTRP8+ MCT correlated with the clinical parameter of biochemical recurrence. We showed that the human MC line ROSAKIT WT expressed RXFP1 transcripts and responded to CTRP8 treatment with a small but significant increase in cell proliferation. Like the cognate RXFP1 ligand RLN-2 and the small molecule RXFP1 agonist ML-290, CTRP8 reduced degranulation of ROSAKIT WT MC stimulated by the Ca2+-ionophore A14187.

Neurodegeneration results in excessive neuronal cell death, and cancer emerges from increased proliferation and resistance to cell death. Although most epidemiological studies support an inverse association between the risk for the development of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, increasing evidence points to a positive correlation between specific types of cancer, like prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), and neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson's disease (PD).  Methods:   PD and PRAD differential genes were screened through the GEO database, and the differential genes were analyzed using David, String, GEPIA, Kaplan-Meier plotter, TIMER2.0, proteinatlas, cBioPortal, and CTD databases to elucidate the biological function and molecular mechanism of PD and PRAD-related genes.  Results:   Studies have shown that the hub gene and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PD were differentially expressed in PRAD, including CDC20, HSPA4L, ROBO1, DMKN, IFI27L2, LUZP2, PTN, PTGDS. In PRAD, the high expression of HSPA4L, ROBO1, DMKN, IFI27L2, PTN, and PTGDS genes was associated with longer survival, while the patients with low expression of CDC20 and LUZP2 genes had longer survival. The mRNA of CDC20 and LUZP2 were highly expressed, while the mRNAs of HSPA4L, ROBO1, DMKN, IFI27L2, and PTGDS were low expressed. Gene methylation did not affect the survival of patients. The high expression of miR-142, miR-186, miR-30a, miR-497, miR-590, miR-28, and miR-576 in microRNA (miRNA) might potentially be used as biomarkers for the progression of PD and PRAD and for the early diagnosis of PD and PRAD in the populations. The genes in this study were highly associated with B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. Somatic mutation mainly focused on missense mutation. Therapeutic drugs included acetaminophen and valproic acid (VPA).

We designed a recognition strategy for this region, to drive selective cancer vulnerability in patients. Most undiscriminating anti-Trop-2 mAbs recognize a single immunodominant epitope. Hence, we removed it by deletion mutagenesis. Cancer-specific, glycosylation-prone mAbs were selected by ELISA, bio-layer interferometry, flow cytometry, confocal microscopy for differential binding to cleaved/activated, wild-type and glycosylation site-mutagenized Trop-2. The resulting 2G10 mAb family binds Trop-2-expressing cancer cells, but not Trop-2 on normal cells. We humanized 2G10 by state-of-the-art complementarity determining region grafting/re-modeling, yielding Hu2G10.

We aimed to investigate oncological follow-up and safety data of focal high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) treatment.  Methods:   We conducted a single-center prospective study of 29 patients with PCa treated with (focal) HIFU between 2016 and 2021. Inclusion criteria were unilateral PCa detected by mpMRI-US-fusion prostate biopsy and maximum prostate specific antigen (PSA) of 15 ng/ml. Follow-up included mpMRI-US fusion-re-biopsies 12 and 24 months after HIFU. No re-treatment of HIFU was allowed. The primary endpoint was failure-free survival (FFS), defined as freedom from intervention due to cancer progression.  Results:   Median follow-up of all patients was 23 months, median age was 67 years and median preoperative PSA was 6.8 ng/ml. One year after HIFU treatment PCa was still detected in 13/ 29 patients histologically (44.8%). Two years after HIFU another 7/29 patients (24.1%) were diagnosed with PCa. Until now, PCa recurrence was detected in 11/29 patients (37.93%) which represents an FFS rate of 62%.One patient developed local metastatic disease 2 years after focal HIFU. Adverse events (AE) were low with 70% of patients remaining with sufficient erectile function for intercourse and 97% reporting full maintenance of urinary continence.

Methods:   Retrospective study including patients from 14 referral centers who underwent pre-biopsy mpMRI, image-guided biopsies and radical prostatectomy. The cohort included biopsy-naive IR PCa patients who met the following inclusion criteria: Gleason Grade Group (GGG) 1-2, PSA < 20 ng/mL, and cT1-cT2 tumors. We relied on a recursive machine learning partitioning algorithm developed to predict adverse pathological features (i.e., ≥ pT3a and/or pN + and/or GGG ≥ 3).  Results:   A total of 594 patients with IR PCa were included, of whom 220 (37%) had adverse features. PI-RADS score (weight:0.726), PSA density (weight:0.158), and clinical T stage (weight:0.116) were selected as the most informative risk factors to classify patients according to their risk of adverse features, leading to the creation of five risk clusters. The adverse feature rates for cluster #1 (PI-RADS ≤ 3 and PSA density < 0.15), cluster #2 (PI-RADS 4 and PSA density < 0.15), cluster #3 (PI-RADS 1-4 and PSA density ≥ 0.15), cluster #4 (normal DRE and PI-RADS 5), and cluster #5 (abnormal DRE and PI-RADS 5) were 11.8, 27.9, 37.3, 42.7, and 65.1%, respectively. Compared with the current inclusion criteria, extending the AS criteria to clusters #1 + #2 or #1 + #2 + #3 would increase the number of eligible patients (+ 60 and + 253%, respectively) without increasing the risk of adverse pathological features.  Conclusions:   The newly developed model has the potential to expand the number of patients eligible for AS without compromising oncologic outcomes.

A single-center prospective observational study""","""Background:   Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is characterized by heterogeneity among patients as well as therapy responses due to diverse genetic, epigenetic differences, and resistance mechanisms. At this stage of the disease, therapy modalities should be individualized in light of the patients' clinical state, symptoms, and genetic characteristics. In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the outcome of patients with mCRPC treated with 177 Lutetium labeled PSMA-617 therapy (PSMA-RLT), as well as baseline and therapy-related parameters associated with survival.  Methods:   This prospective study included 52 patients who received two to six cycles of PSMA-RLT. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-progression-free survival (PFS). 18 F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 68 Ga-PSMA (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography (PET/CT) scans were performed for a comprehensive assessment of tumor burden and heterogeneity. Biochemical, imaging, clinical, and therapy-related parameters were analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier, log-rank, and Cox regression analyses to predict OS and PFS.  Results:   Median OS and PSA-PFS were 17.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 15.2-20.2) and 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.5-8.8), respectively. Primary resistance to PSMA-RLT (hazard ratio [HR]: 12.57, 95% CI: 2.4-65.2, p: 0.003), <30% PSA response rate after first cycle of PSMA-RLT (HR: 1.016, 95% CI: 1.006-1.03, p: 0.003), FDG > PSMA disease (HR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.19-20.62, p: 0.03), PSA doubling time (PSA DT) of ≤2.4 months (HR: 15.7, 95% CI: 3.7-66.4, p: <0.0001), and low hemoglobin levels (HR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.41-0.83, p: 0.003) were correlated with poor OS in the multivariate analysis. Bone scintigraphy > PSMA disease (HR: 5.6; 95% CI: 1.8-17, p: 0.002) and high C-reactive protein (HR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7, p: 0.001) were significant predictive biomarkers for PFS in the multivariate analysis.

Methods:   In the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2004-2016), we identified 34,908 RT patients with at least one DHRCs, namely prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >20 ng/dL (hrPSA), biopsy Grade Group (hrGG) 4-5, clinical T stage (hrcT) ≥T2c. Multivariable Cox regression models (CRM), as well as competing risks regression (CRR) model, which further adjust for other cause mortality, tested the association between DHRCs and 5-year CSM.  Results:   Of 34,908 patients, 14,777 (42%) exclusively harbored hrGG, 5641 (16%) hrPSA, 4390 (13%) had hrcT. Only 8238 (23.7%) harbored any combination of two DHRCs and 1862 (5.3%) had all three DHRCs. Five-year CSM rates ranged from 2.4% to 5.0% when any individual DHRC was present (hrcT, hrPSA, hrGG, in that order), versus 5.2% to 10.5% when two DHRCs were present (hrPSA+hrcT, hrcT+hrGG, hrPSA+hrGG, in that order) versus 14.4% when all three DHRCs were identified. In multivariable CRM hazard ratios relative to hrcT ranged from 1.07 to 1.76 for one DHRC, 2.20 to 3.83 for combinations of two DHRCs, and 5.11 for all three DHRCs. Multivariable CRR yielded to virtually the same results.  Conclusions:   Our study indicates a stimulus-response effect according to the type and number of DHRCs.

This may be due to the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that survived said therapies. In this study, we aimed to uncover the relationship between cell density and CSCs, and the role of the Warburg effect in regulating CSC-like characteristics. A prostate cancer cell line, PC3, was used in this study. To investigate the Warburg effect effect and CSC-like characteristics in prostate cancer, we measured the expression levels of glycolysis and OXPHOS-related genes, and performed spheroid forming, cell viability and various glycolysis and OXPHOS-assays. We observed that increased cell density caused a metabolic shift from glycolysis to OXPHOS and higher CSC-like characteristics. However, the use of dichloroacetate (DCA), an inhibitor of the Warburg effect, significantly inhibited the cell-density-induced metabolic shift and CSC-like characteristics. Changes in cell density strongly influenced the preferred metabolic pathway of prostate cancer cells, regulating their CSC-like characteristics. It is possible that DCA, an inhibitor of the Warburg effect, could be a novel drug used to treat CSCs by distinguishing Warburg effect, preventing future cancer relapses.""","""['Hung Wei Lai', 'Moe Kasai', 'Shinkuro Yamamoto', 'Hideo Fukuhara', 'Takashi Karashima', 'Atsuhi Kurabayashi', 'Mutsuo Furihata', 'Kazuhiro Hanazaki', 'Keiji Inoue', 'Shun-Ichiro Ogura']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biol Open""","""['Application of mitochondrial pyruvate carrier blocker UK5099 creates metabolic reprogram and greater stem-like properties in LnCap prostate cancer cells in vitro.', 'Metabolic shift toward oxidative phosphorylation in docetaxel resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Cancer stem cell molecular reprogramming of the Warburg effect in glioblastomas: a new target gleaned from an old concept.', 'Hallmarks of cancer stem cell metabolism.', 'EGF induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer stem-like cell properties in human oral cancer cells via promoting Warburg effect.']"""

The contribution of MS to discriminate cases from controls was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). After confounder adjustment, we observed: large associations (RR = 1.5-1.7) with lung cancer risk for smoking MS; moderate associations (RR = 1.2-1.3) with urothelial cancer risk for smoking MS and with mature B-cell neoplasm risk for BMI and alcohol MS; moderate to small associations (RR = 1.1-1.2) for BMI and alcohol MS with several cancer types and cancer overall.

Mutations and accumulation of chromosomal deviations are correlated with the development and aggressiveness of PCa. Cell cycle checkpoint pathways and DNA repair mechanisms are reported to deviate in cancers. Mammalian checkpoint kinase 1/2 (CHEK1/CHEK2) genes act as key signal transducers inside the genomic integrity checkpoints. CHEK1 and CHEK2 gene mutations were reported in a few different types of cancers. In PCa, CHEK2 mutations were studied, but CHEK1 gene variations were not well investigated.  Objective:   This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of variations in the CHEK1 and CHEK2 genes in PCa in the Jordanian population.  Methods:   Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded PCa specimens of radical prostatectomy surgical procedures from 74 Jordanian patients were subjected to DNA extraction, polymerase chain reactions and Sanger sequencing to screen the mutations in selected exons of CHEK1 and CHEK2 tumor suppressor genes.  Results:   The presence of F281L (T/C) (1.4%) homologous missense point mutation in the kinase domain of the CHEK2 gene and P188P (1.4%) silent point mutation in the kinase domain of the CHEK1 gene. In addition, the 1100delC mutation was not detected in the studied PCa specimens.  Conclusion:   In line with previous reports, the presence of CHEK2 mutation with a frequency of 1.4% supported the possible role of genetic variants of this gene in the development of PCa. No 1100delC mutation was detected in this study. No association was found in this study between CHEK1 mutations and the development of PCa.

Implications of the immune microenvironment in predicting the biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS) after radical prostatectomy and the efficacy of systemic therapies in prostate cancer remain ambiguous.  Methods:   The tumor immune contexture score (TICS) involving eight immune contexture-related signatures was developed using seven cohorts of 1120 patients treated with radical prostatectomy (training: GSE46602, GSE54460, GSE70769, and GSE94767; validation: GSE70768, DKFZ2018, and TCGA). The association between the TICS and treatment efficacy was investigated in GSE111177 (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]) and EGAS00001004050 (ipilimumab).  Results:   A high TICS was associated with prolonged BCRFS after radical prostatectomy in the training (HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.24-0.45, P < 0.001) and the validation cohorts (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.32-0.62, P < 0.001). The TICS showed stable prognostic power independent of tumor stage, surgical margin, pre-treatment prostatic specific antigen (PSA), and Gleason score (multivariable HR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.39-0.63, P < 0.001). Adding the TICS into the prognostic model constructed using clinicopathological features significantly improved its 1/2/3/4/5-year area under curve (P < 0.05). A low TICS was associated with high homologous recombination deficiency scores, abnormally activated pathways concerning DNA replication, cell cycle, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and drug metabolism, and fewer tumor-infiltrating immune cells (P < 0.05). The patients with a high TICS had favorable BCRFS with ADT (HR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.06-0.99, P = 0.034) or ipilimumab monotherapy (HR = 0.23, 95% CI 0.06-0.81, P = 0.012).

Although an LCS program has not yet started in Australia, two trials have provided local data on the feasibility, selection criteria and outcomes. A government-commissioned report has detailed a potential national program, and Federal Budget funding has been committed to early feasibility projects that include population-specific consultations with, for example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who are at higher risk of lung cancer due to high smoking rates.

The objective of this study was to evaluate treatment trends and outcomes in HR patients defined by PSA alone and otherwise low-risk features.  Methods:   Using the National Cancer Database, we identified patients diagnosed with HR PCa between 2010 and 2016. A study group of patients defined by PSA >20 ng/ml alone and otherwise low-risk features, was compared to a group of HR patients defined by Gleason score or stage. We compared treatment rates over time, the use of concomitant androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and overall survival (OS). Examination of treatment trends was done using a Z-test analysis. A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to determine 5-year OS with the Log-rank test for comparison. Statistical analyses were completed using R Version 3.5.2.  Results:   We identified 5,652 patients in the study group and 71,922 in the comparison group. Only 6.8% of the study group had disease ≥cT2, compared to 43.7% in the comparison group. In the study group, 12.5% (709), underwent active surveillance (AS), 36.4% (2,055) radiation therapy (EBRT) and 51.1% (2,888) radical prostatectomy (RP), while the rate of AS, EBRT, and RP in the comparison group were 0.3% (191), 43.0% (30,928), and 56.7% (40,803), respectively. Over the study period, adoption of AS increased from 6.2% in 2010 to 25.0% in 2016 in the study group (P< 0.001), but not in the comparison group. In patients undergoing EBRT, ADT treatment increased from 2010 to 2016 in both groups, though by 2016 only 45.3% of patients in the study group and 86.3% in the comparison group received ADT. The 5-year OS was 93.7% (95% CI 92.8-94.6) in the study group and 89.7% (95% CI 89.2-90.1) in the comparison group (P< 0.001).  Conclusions:   Men with HR PCa defined by PSA with otherwise low risk features present at an earlier stage and receive less aggressive therapy than other HR patients. Despite increased rates of AS and decreased use of ADT, these patients appear to have improved survival when compared to other HR patients. These findings suggest that not all HR patients will benefit from aggressive definitive treatment.""","""['Eyal Kord', 'Basil Ferenczi', 'Renzo G DiNatale', 'Adam Daily', 'Hannah Koenig', 'Jason Frankel', 'Nathan Jung', 'John Paul Flores', 'Christopher Porter']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Use of Concomitant Androgen Deprivation Therapy in Patients Treated with Early Salvage Radiotherapy for Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: Long-term Results from a Large, Multi-institutional Series.', 'Survival Outcomes of Men with Lymph Node-positive Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: A Comparative Analysis of Different Postoperative Management Strategies.', 'Posttreatment Prostate-Specific Antigen 6\xa0Months After Radiation With Androgen Deprivation Therapy Predicts for Distant Metastasis-Free Survival and Prostate Cancer-Specific Mortality.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, these studies have not focused on older adults and do not include treatments beyond chemotherapy. Although chemotherapy, androgen receptor axis-targeted therapies (ARATs), and radium-223 prolong survival, toxicities are substantial and increased in older adults with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC). We aimed to assess RSM feasibility among older adults receiving life-prolonging mPC treatments.  Materials and methods:   Older adults aged 65+ starting chemotherapy, an ARAT, or radium-223 for mPC were enrolled in a multicentre prospective cohort study. As part of the RSM package, participants completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) daily and detailed questionnaires assessing mood, anxiety, fatigue, insomnia, and pain weekly online or by phone throughout one treatment cycle (3-4 weeks). Alerts were sent to the clinical oncology team for severe symptoms (ESAS ≥7). Participants also completed an end of study questionnaire that assessed study burden and satisfaction. Descriptive statistics were used to determine recruitment and retention rates, participant response rates to daily and weekly questionnaires, clinician responses to alerts, and participant satisfaction rates. An inductive descriptive approach was used to categorize open-ended responses about study benefits, challenges, and recommendations into relevant themes.  Results:   Ninety males were included (mean age 77 years, 48% ARAT, 38% chemotherapy, and 14% radium-223). Approximately 38% of patients preferred phone-based RSM. Patients provided RSM responses in 1216 out of 1311 daily questionnaires (93%). Over 93% of participants were satisfied (36%), very satisfied (43%), or extremely satisfied (16%) with RSM, although daily reporting was reported by several (8%) as burdensome. Nearly 45% of patients reported severe symptoms during RSM. Most symptom alerts sent to the oncology care team were acknowledged (97%) and 53% led to follow-ups with a nurse or physician for additional care.  Discussion:   RSM is feasible and acceptable to older adults with mPC, but accommodation needs to be made for phone-based RSM. The optimal frequency and duration of RSM also needs to be established.""","""['Gregory Feng', 'Milothy Parthipan', 'Henriette Breunis', 'Martine Puts', 'Urban Emmenegger', 'Narhari Timilshina', 'Aaron R Hansen', 'Antonio Finelli', 'Monika K Krzyzanowska', 'Andrew Matthew', 'Hance Clarke', 'Daniel Santa Mina', 'Enrique Soto-Perez-de-Celis', 'George Tomlinson', 'Shabbir M H Alibhai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Symptom experiences of older adults during treatment for metastatic prostate cancer: A qualitative investigation.', 'Diagnostic Concordance of Telemedicine as Compared With Face-to-Face Care in Primary Health Care Clinics in Rural India: Randomized Crossover Trial.', 'Electronic self-reporting of adverse events for patients undergoing cancer treatment: the eRAPID research programme including two RCTs.', 'Acceptance and commitment therapy for older people with treatment-resistant generalised anxiety disorder: the FACTOID feasibility study.', 'Cognition and depression effects of androgen receptor axis-targeted drugs in men with prostate cancer: A systematic review.']"""

It has been shown that ADAM10 overexpression correlates with aberrant signaling from Notch, erbBs, and other receptors, as well as a more aggressive metastatic phenotype, in a range of cancers including colon, gastric, prostate, breast, ovarian, uterine, and leukemia. ADAM10 inhibition, therefore, stands out as an important and new approach to deter the progression of advanced CRC. For targeting the ADAM10 substrate-binding region, which is located outside of the catalytic domain of the protease, we generated a human anti-ADAM10 monoclonal antibody named 1H5. Structural and functional characterization of 1H5 reveals that it binds to the substrate-binding cysteine-rich domain and recognizes an activated ADAM10 conformation present on tumor cells. The mAb inhibits Notch cleavage and proliferation of colon cancer cell lines in vitro and in mouse models. Consistent with its binding to activated ADAM10, the mAb augments the catalytic activity of ADAM10 towards small peptide substrates in vitro. Most importantly, in a mouse model of colon cancer, when administered in combination with the therapeutic agent Irinotecan, 1H5 causes highly effective tumor growth inhibition without any discernible toxicity effects. Our singular approach to target the ADAM10 substrate-binding region with therapeutic antibodies could overcome the shortcomings of previous intervention strategies of targeting the protease active site with small molecule inhibitors that exhibit musculoskeletal toxicity.""","""['Nayanendu Saha', 'Du-San Baek', 'Rachelle P Mendoza', 'Dorothea Robev', 'Yan Xu', 'Yehuda Goldgur', 'M Jason De La Cruz', 'Elisa de Stanchina', 'Peter W Janes', 'Kai Xu', 'Dimiter S Dimitrov', 'Dimitar B Nikolov']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Trop-2 induces ADAM10-mediated cleavage of E-cadherin and drives EMT-less metastasis in colon cancer.', 'Tetraspanin-29 activates Notch signaling by interacting with ADAM10 to enhance its activity in colorectal cancer.', 'Proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by ADAM10 mediates proliferation and migration in breast cancer.', 'Regulation of the trafficking and the function of the metalloprotease ADAM10 by tetraspanins.', 'ADAM10 as a target for anti-cancer therapy.']"""

We previously reported high CD46 expression in prostate cancer and developed an antibody-drug conjugate and immunoPET agent based on the YS5 antibody, which targets a tumor-selective CD46 epitope. Here, we present the preparation, preclinical efficacy, and toxicity evaluation of [225Ac]DOTA-YS5, a radioimmunotherapy agent based on the YS5 antibody.  Experimental design:   [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 was developed, and its therapeutic efficiency was tested on cell-derived (22Rv1, DU145), and patient-derived (LTL-545, LTL484) prostate cancer xenograft models. Biodistribution studies were carried out on 22Rv1 tumor xenograft models to confirm the targeting efficacy. Toxicity analysis of the [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 was carried out on nu/nu mice to study short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) toxicity.  Results:   Biodistribution study shows that [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 agent delivers high levels of radiation to the tumor tissue (11.64% ± 1.37%ID/g, 28.58% ± 10.88%ID/g, 29.35% ± 7.76%ID/g, and 31.78% ± 5.89%ID/g at 24, 96, 168, and 408 hours, respectively), compared with the healthy organs. [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 suppressed tumor size and prolonged survival in cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Toxicity analysis revealed that the 0.5 μCi activity levels showed toxicity to the kidneys, likely due to redistribution of daughter isotope 213Bi.  Conclusions:   [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 suppressed the growth of cell-derived and patient-derived xenografts, including prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive and prostate-specific membrane antigen-deficient models.

Methods:   PRAD samples were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), Oncomine, and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) to analyze the differences in TREM2 expression between normal and tumor tissues. The influence of TREM2 on the clinicopathological characteristics and its prognostic value were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier curve, Cox regression analysis, ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plot, and nomogram. Gene Ontology (GO), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) were conducted to screen biological functions and pathways. The relationship between TREM2 and tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristics was explored. The TREM2 expression in PRAD specimens and cell lines was assessed by immunohistochemistry staining and western blot. TREM2-specific siRNAs were used to evaluate the effects of TREM2 on cell function.  Results:   TREM2 was upregulated and positively associated with poor clinicopathologic characteristics. Overexpression of TREM2 is an independent biomarker for the prognosis of PFI (progression-free interval). Moreover, TREM2 expression was positively correlated with various TME characteristics. Knockdown of TREM2 inhibited the migration of PRAD cell lines via the PI3K/AKT axis.

The effects of lipid metabolism on tumor growth have been explored, but the mechanistic details of the association of lipid metabolism disorders with PCa remain largely elusive.  Methods:   The RNA sequencing data of the GSE45604 and The Cancer Genome Atlas-Prostate Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-PRAD) datasets were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and UCSC Xena databases, respectively. The Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) was utilized to identify lipid metabolism-related genes. The limma R package was used to identify differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related genes (DE-LMRGs) and differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs). Moreover, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) were applied to select signature miRNAs and construct a lipid metabolism-related diagnostic model. The expression levels of selected differentially expressed lipid metabolism-related miRNAs (DE-LMRMs) in PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) specimens were verified using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT‒PCR). Furthermore, a transcription factor (TF)-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed. Eventually, Kaplan‒Meier (KM) curves were plotted to illustrate the associations between signature miRNA-related mRNAs and TFs and overall survival (OS) along with biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCR).  Results:   Forty-seven LMRMs were screened based on the correlation analysis of 29 DE-LMRGs and 56 DEMs, in which 27 LMRMs were stably expressed in the GSE45604 dataset. Subsequently, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and machine learning methods were employed to develop a lipid metabolism-related diagnostic signature, which may be of diagnostic value for PCa patients. qRT‒PCR results showed that all seven key DE-LMRMs were differentially expressed between PCa and BPH tissues. Eventually, a TF-miRNA‒mRNA network was constructed.  Conclusions:   These results suggested that 7 key diagnostic miRNAs were closely related to PCa pathological processes and provided new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of PCa. Moreover, CLIC6 and SCNN1A linked to miR-200c-3p had good prognostic potential and provided valuable insights into the pathogenesis of PCa.""","""['Tianyuan Zhai', 'Meng Dou', 'Yubo Ma', 'Hong Wang', 'Fang Liu', 'Liandong Zhang', 'Tie Chong', 'Ziming Wang', 'Li Xue']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Lipids Health Dis""","""['Construction and analysis of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and TF regulatory networks reveal the key genes associated with prostate cancer.', 'Potential plasma microRNAs signature miR-190b-5p, miR-215-5p and miR-527 as non-invasive biomarkers for prostate cancer.', 'Identification of Potential miRNAs Biomarkers for High-Grade Prostate Cancer by Integrated Bioinformatics Analysis.', 'Detection of miRNAs in urine of prostate cancer patients.', 'New insights into lipid metabolism and prostate cancer (Review).']"""

This study aimed to compare activity of taxanes (TAX) versus that of androgen-receptor therapy (ART) in men with mCRPC treated with first-line ART.  Patients and methods:   This retrospective study included all consecutive chemo-naive mCRPC patients who have received first-line ART treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared between patients treated with second-line ART or TAX.  Results:   Overall, 175 patients treated with first-line enzalutamide (ENZA, n = 75) or abiraterone (ABI, n = 100) were evaluated. Among them, 69 (39%) and 30 (17%) patients received second-line TAX and ART, respectively, while 76 (43%) patients did not receive further treatment. From the start of first-line therapy, the median PFS and OS were 13 months (95% CI: 11-15) and 34 months (95% CI: 29-39), respectively, without any significant difference between ENZA and ABI. From the start of second-line therapy, the median PFS and OS were 6 months (95% CI: 5-7) and 18 months (95% CI: 14-21), respectively. Compared with ART, docetaxel was associated with significantly higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA, ≥ 50%) (29% vs. 0%, P < .001) and radiological responses (21% vs. 0%, P < .001). PFS was longer in TAX than in ART (6.7 months vs. 4 months, HR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.96, P = .034), but there was no significant difference in OS (19 months vs. 12 months, P = .1). After propensity score adjustment, PFS (P = .2) and OS (P = .1) were similar between second-line TAX and ART.  Conclusion:   In the second-line setting, TAX provides higher PSA and radiological responses than does ART for mCRPC patients who received first-line ART, but the PFS and OS are similar.

Previous androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), which is known to cause bone loss, as well as anti-resorptive agents such as zoledronic acid (ZA), used to prevent skeletal complications, may influence these interactions and thereby the growth of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in the bone marrow (BM). Here, a spontaneously metastatic xenograft tumor model of human PCa was further optimized to mimic the common clinical situation of ADT (castration) combined with primary tumor resection in vivo. The effects of these interventions, alone or in combination with ZA treatment, on tumor cell dissemination to the BM and other distant sites were analyzed. Metastatic burden was quantified by human-specific Alu-qPCR, bioluminescence imaging (BLI), and immunohistochemistry. Further, bone remodeling was assessed by static histomorphometry and serum parameters. Initial comparative analysis between NSG and SCID mice showed that spontaneous systemic dissemination of subcutaneous PC-3 xenograft tumors was considerably enhanced in NSG mice. Primary tumor resection and thereby prolonged observational periods resulted in a higher overall metastatic cell load at necropsy and tumor growth alone caused significant bone loss, which was further augmented by surgical castration. In addition, castrated mice showed a strong trend towards higher bone metastasis loads. Weekly treatment of mice with ZA completely prevented castration- and tumor-induced bone loss but had no effect on bone metastasis burden. Conversely, the total lung metastasis load as determined by BLI was significantly decreased upon ZA treatment. These findings provide a basis for future research on the role of ZA not only in preventing skeletal complications but also in reducing metastasis to other organs.""","""['Lukas Clemens Böckelmann', 'Vera Freytag', 'Ann-Kristin Ahlers', 'Hanna Maar', 'Tobias Gosau', 'Anke Baranowsky', 'Rüdiger Schmitz', 'Klaus Pantel', 'Udo Schumacher', 'Marie-Therese Haider', 'Tobias Lange']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Bone""","""['Prevention of bone metastases in patients with high-risk nonmetastatic prostate cancer treated with zoledronic acid: efficacy and safety results of the Zometa European Study (ZEUS).', 'Castration-induced bone loss triggers growth of disseminated prostate cancer cells in bone.', 'Efficacy of combined androgen blockade with zoledronic acid treatment in prostate cancer with bone metastasis: the ZABTON-PC (zoledronic acid/androgen blockade trial on prostate cancer) study.', 'Zoledronic acid for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer and the Bone: Significance and Therapeutic Options.']"""

The treatment uses cytotoxic drugs to target cells that grow and divide quickly. On the other hand, the growth of such cancerous tumors depends on angiogenesis. In this paper, we numerically study a diffuse-interface model in a two-dimensional space related to the therapies of prostate cancer. The proposed model describes the tumor growth driven by a generic nutrient and producing the prostate-specific antigen. More precisely, the effect of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the model is evaluated by considering a time-dependent function in the tumor dynamics. Also, another function related to the antiangiogenic therapy is considered to show the reducing intratumoral nutrient supply in the nutrient dynamics. Here, a meshless approximation, i.e., a generalized form of the direct radial basis function partition of unity (D-RBF-PU) method is presented for finding the numerical simulations of this model utilizing in medical oncology. The method uses the lower number of trial points in each patch than the original D-RBF-PU scheme for approximating the trial function per test point. Hence, the time complexity of the method is less than the D-RBF-PU technique. Besides, a semi-implicit time discretization of order 1 has been used to deal with the time variable. Consequently, a linear system of algebraic equations could be solved iteratively per time step by the use of the biconjugate gradient stabilized method with zero-fill incomplete lower-upper preconditioner.

Methods:   The population included 1,034 African American (AA) survivors who received chemotherapy for breast, colorectal, lung or prostate cancer. CIPN prevalence was based on initial occurrence of worsening of self-reported pain, numbness or tingling after chemotherapy. Current CIPN included symptoms still present at the time of the survey, and persistent CIPN symptoms were present 12 or more months post-chemotherapy. CIPN severity was ranked as mild, moderate or severe. Logistic regression was utilized to evaluate sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with the various categories of CIPN.  Results:   CIPN prevalence was 68%, with 53% current and 52% persistent. The symptom severity distribution based on prevalent CIPN included 32.2% mild, 30.8% moderate, and 36.9% severe.

This study compared quantitative parameters or radiomic features from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) or positron emission tomography (PET), as inputs into machine learning (ML) to predict the Gleason scores (GS) of detected lesions for improved PCa lesion classification.  Methods:   20 biopsy-confirmed PCa subjects underwent imaging before radical prostatectomy. A pathologist assigned GS from tumour tissue. Two radiologists and one nuclear medicine physician delineated the lesions on the mpMR and PET images, yielding 45 lesion inputs. Seven quantitative parameters were extracted from the lesions, namely T2-weighted (T2w) image intensity, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), transfer constant (KTRANS), efflux rate constant (Kep), and extracellular volume ratio (Ve) from mpMR images, and SUVmean and SUVmax from PET images. Eight radiomic features were selected out of 109 radiomic features from T2w, ADC and PET images. Quantitative parameters or radiomic features, with risk factors of age, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), PSA density and volume, of 45 different lesion inputs were input in different combinations into four ML models - Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest-Neighbour (kNN), Ensembles model (EM).  Results:   SUVmax yielded the highest accuracy in discriminating detected lesions.

The GRPR antagonist peptide RM2 has been successfully conjugated with several chelators and radiolabeled with gallium-68. The goal of this study was to synthesize a 99mTc-labeled probe and investigate its potential for SPECT imaging of prostate cancer. Towards this HYNIC-RM2 peptide conjugate was synthesized, radiolabeled with 99mTc and evaluated in GRPR-positive PC3 tumor xenografts.  Methods:   HYNIC-RM2 was manually synthesized by standard Fmoc solid phase strategy and radiolabeled with 99mTc. In vitro cell studies were performed in GRPR-positive human prostate carcinoma (PC3) cells. Metabolic stability studies of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-RM2 were performed in normal mice in the presence as well as absence of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor, phosphoramidon (PA). Biodistribution and imaging studies of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-RM2 were performed in SCID mice bearing PC3-xenograft.  Results:   [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-RM2 exhibited high binding affinity in low nanomolar range (Kd = 1.83 ± 0.31 nM). Metabolic stability studies in mice indicated that in the absence of PA, radiolabeled peptide was about 65 % intact in the blood at 15 min p.i., whereas proportion of intact radiolabeled peptide was enhanced to 90 % on co-administration of PA. Biodistribution studies in PC3 tumor bearing mice demonstrated high tumor uptake (8.02 ± 0.9%ID/g and 6.13 ± 0.44%ID/g at 1 h and 3 h p.i.). Co-administration of PA with the radiolabeled peptide resulted in further enhancement of tumor uptake (14.24 ± 0.76 % ID/g and 11.71 ± 0.59%ID/g at 1 h and 3 h p.i.). SPECT/CT images of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-RM2 could clearly visualize the tumor. Significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the tumor uptake with a co-injected blocking dose of unlabeled peptide ascertained the GRPR specificity of [99mTc]Tc-HYNIC-RM2.

In this context, IDC is thought to represent the retrograde spread of invasive prostatic adenocarcinoma into the acini and ducts. Prior studies have demonstrated a concordance of PTEN loss and genomic instability between the IDC and high-grade invasive components of PCa, but larger genomic association studies to solidify our understanding of the relationship between these 2 lesions are lacking. Here, we evaluate the genomic relationship between duct-confined (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and IDC) and invasive components of high-grade PCa using genetic variants generated by whole exome sequencing. High-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and IDC were laser-microdissected, and PCa and nonneoplastic tissue was manually dissected from 12 radical prostatectomies. A targeted next-generation sequencing panel was used to identify disease-relevant variants. Additionally, the degree of overlap between adjacent lesions was determined by comparing exome-wide variants detected using whole exome sequencing data. Our results demonstrate that IDC and invasive high-grade PCa components show common genetic variants and copy number alterations. Hierarchical clustering of genome-wide variants suggests that in these tumors, IDC is more closely related to the high-grade invasive components of the tumor compared with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. In conclusion, this study reinforces the concept that, in the context of high-grade PCa, IDC likely represents a late event associated with tumor progression.""","""['Erica Vormittag-Nocito', 'Andres M Acosta', 'Shivangi Agarwal', 'Kunwar D Narayan', 'Ravindra Kumar', 'Mohamed Rizwan H Al Rasheed', 'Andre Kajdacsy-Balla', 'Frederick G Behm', 'Gayatry Mohapatra']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mod Pathol""","""['Intraductal carcinoma of the prostate in the absence of high-grade invasive carcinoma represents a molecularly distinct type of in situ carcinoma enriched with oncogenic driver mutations.', 'ETS gene aberrations in atypical cribriform lesions of the prostate: Implications for the distinction between intraductal carcinoma of the prostate and cribriform high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia.', 'Atypical intraductal proliferation and intraductal carcinoma of the prostate on core needle biopsy: a comparative clinicopathological and molecular study with a proposal to expand the morphological spectrum of intraductal carcinoma.', 'Intraductal carcinoma of prostate: a comprehensive and concise review.', 'Prostatic Adenocarcinoma, Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia, and Intraductal Carcinoma.']"""

The whole prostate was manually contoured on PET images and 103 image biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI)-compliant radiomic features (RFs) were extracted. Features were then selected using the minimum redundancy maximum relevance algorithm and a combination of the 4 most relevant RFs was used to train 12 radiomics machine learning models for the prediction of PSISUP grade: ISUP ≥ 4 vs ISUP < 4. Machine learning models were validated by means of fivefold repeated cross-validation, and two control models were generated to assess that our findings were not surrogates of spurious associations. Balanced accuracy (bACC) was collected for all generated models and compared with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were also reported to provide a complete overview of models' performance. The predictions of the best performing model were compared against ISUP grade at biopsy.  Results:   ISUP grade at biopsy was upgraded in 9/47 patients after prostatectomy, resulting in a bACC = 85.9%, SN = 71.9%, SP = 100%, PPV = 100%, and NPV = 62.5%, while the best-performing radiomic model yielded a bACC = 87.6%, SN = 88.6%, SP = 86.7%, PPV = 94%, and NPV = 82.5%.

This study examines the value of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-informed surgery and RT in patients with BCR treated without systemic therapy.  Methods:   This is a post-hoc subgroup analysis of a prospective clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were: histologically proven prostate cancer at initial curative-intent treatment, BCR after primary treatment with curative intent, having five or fewer lesions identified on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT, and treatment with either PET/CT-directed RT or surgery without systemic therapy. The biochemical progression-free survival after PSMA ligand PET/CT-directed RT and surgery was determined. Uni- and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed for the association of patients' characteristics, tumor-specific variables, and PSMA PET/CT imaging results with biochemical progression at the last follow-up.  Results:   Fifty-eight patients (30 in surgery and 28 in radiotherapy groups) met the inclusion criteria. A total of 87 PSMA-positive lesions were detected: 16 local recurrences (18.4%), 54 regional lymph nodes (62.1%), 6 distant lymph nodes (6,8%), and 11 osseous lesions (12.7%). A total of 85.7% (24 of 28) and 70.0% (21 of 30) of patients showed a ≥ 50% decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels after RT and surgery, respectively. At a median follow-up time of 21 months (range, 6-32 months), the median biochemical progression-free survival was 19 months (range, 4 to 23 months) in the radiotherapy group, as compared with 16.5 months (range, 4 to 28 months) in the surgery group. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, the number of PSMA positive lesions (2-5 lesions compared to one lesion), and the anatomic location of the detected lesions (distant metastasis vs. local relapse and pelvic nodal relapse) significantly correlated with biochemical progression at the last follow-up, whereas other clinical, tumor-specific, and imaging parameters did not.  Conclusions:   This study suggests that RT or surgery based on [18F]DCFPyL PET/CT are associated with high PSA response rates. The number and site of lesions detected on the PSMA PET/CT were predictive of biochemical progression on follow-up. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of targeting these sites on patient relevant outcomes.

Our aim was to compare the diagnostic performance of 18F-1007-PEMA-PET/CT, mpMRI, and mpMRI + PEMA-PET/CT in local progression and lymph node invasion of prostate cancer using histopathology as the gold standard.  Materials and methods:   In this retrospective study, all patients with prostate cancer who underwent mpMRI and 18F-PSMA-1007-PET/CT before operation were included. The role of preoperative imaging was evaluated by predicting the sensitivity and specificity of EPE (extraprostatic extension), SVI (seminal vesicle invasion), and lymph node invasion results.  Results:   Ultimately, 130 patients were included in this study. In the preoperative judgment of EPE and SVI, mpMRI + PSMA-PET/CT had higher sensitivity and specificity. When predicting lymph node metastasis, PSMA-PET/CT was the best choice. The accuracy of mpMRI + PSMA-PET/CT and PSMA-PET/CT in the T and N stages, respectively, was affected by the least factors.  Conclusions:   Based on the combined results of mpMRI and 18F-1007-PSMA-PET/CT, the accuracy of the preoperative judgment of prostatic capsule invasion can be improved, which may be conducive to developing intra-fascial technology while ensuring no tumor-touch isolation. PSMA-PET/CT has the advantages over mpMRI alone in terms of lymph node positivity. Compared with PSMA-PET/CT alone, the combined results can improve the sensitivity, but reduce specificity.

Mechanisms driving this metabolic rewiring remain largely unknown.  Methods:   NKX2-1 overexpressing and NKX2-1 knockdown/knockout T-cell leukaemia and lung cancer cell line models were established to study metabolic rewiring using ChIP-qPCR, immunoblotting, mass spectrometry, and proliferation and invasion assays. Findings and therapeutic relevance were validated in mouse models and confirmed in patient datasets.  Results:   Exploring T-cell leukaemia, lung cancer and neuroendocrine prostate cancer patient datasets highlighted the transcription factor NKX2-1 as putative driver of serine/glycine metabolism. We demonstrate that transcription factor NKX2-1 binds and transcriptionally upregulates serine/glycine synthesis enzyme genes, enabling NKX2-1 expressing cells to proliferate and invade in serine/glycine-depleted conditions. NKX2-1 driven serine/glycine synthesis generates nucleotides and redox molecules, and is associated with an altered cellular lipidome and methylome. Accordingly, NKX2-1 tumour-bearing mice display enhanced tumour aggressiveness associated with systemic metabolic rewiring.

The relationship between circulating EVs in the peripheral blood and natural killer (NK) cells in prostate cancer (PCa) is unclear. This study aimed at investigating the key regulators in the interaction between circulating EVs and NK cells in PCa patients before and after tumor removal. NK-cell characteristics were prospectively assessed in 79 patients treated with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy preoperatively and postoperatively. Compared with healthy donors, the existence of prostate tumors increased the number of circulating EVs and altered ligand expression of EVs. Circulating EVs extracted from cancer patients significantly decreased NKA of NK cells compared with those extracted from healthy donors. Upon treatment with an inhibiting antibody or small interfering RNA, natural killer cell protein group 2A (NKG2A) was identified as the main NKA regulator in cancer patients for accepting the signal from circulating EVs. After surgery, NKA was increased and NKG2A expression on NK cells was significantly reduced. The expression of ligands for natural killer cell protein group 2D (NKG2D) on EVs and the level of circulation EVs both significantly increased.

The goal of personalised oncology is to selectively kill cancer cells while minimising side effects on normal tissue. This can be achieved by identifying and targeting cancer vulnerabilities that distinguish it from normal cells. Many cancers are deficient in high-fidelity DNA repair pathways that maintain genomic stability, such as homologous recombination (HR). Such cancers are highly sensitive to targeted therapies that induce DNA damage or inhibit DNA repair pathways. A notable example and a poster child of personalised oncology are PARP1/2 inhibitors (PARPi) that selectively kill HR-deficient (HRD) cancer cells by preventing repair of DNA gaps or single-strand breaks (SSBs) (Slade, 2020). Inhibitors of cell cycle checkpoints such as CHK1 and WEE1 can also eliminate HRD cancers by pushing cancer cells through the cell cycle despite unrepaired DNA damage and causing death by mitotic catastrophe (Groelly et al, 2022). PARPi have been approved for the treatment of ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancer but other cancer types with an HRD signature (HRDness) may also respond to PARPi treatment. Planas-Paz et al (2023) now show that many sarcomas show HRDness and respond to PARP1/2 and WEE1 inhibitors, thus offering a new personalised oncology approach for this treatment-refractory cancer.""","""['Dea Slade', 'Joanna I Loizou']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""EMBO Mol Med""","""['Unravelling homologous recombination repair deficiency and therapeutic opportunities in soft tissue and bone sarcoma.', 'Unravelling homologous recombination repair deficiency and therapeutic opportunities in soft tissue and bone sarcoma.', 'Testing for homologous recombination repair or homologous recombination deficiency for poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors: A current perspective.', 'Cracking the homologous recombination deficiency code: how to identify responders to PARP inhibitors.', 'Homologous Recombination Repair Deficiency: An Overview for Pathologists.', 'Therapeutic targeting of DNA damage repair pathways guided by homologous recombination deficiency scoring in ovarian cancers.']"""

However, its optimal timing is highly controversial.  Methods:   The study sample consisted of 77 men who underwent RP, received salvage RT against BCR, and underwent salvage ADT for PSA progression. The endpoint of this study was development to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), from the start of salvage RT.  Results:   The median follow-up time was 9.5 years, and 20 patients experienced CRPC. The multivariable analysis identified PSA-doubling time (PSA-DT) ≤ 12 months (hazard ratio, 3.5) and seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) (hazard ratio, 4.4) as independent risk factors. We defined the high-risk and low-risk groups as those with one or two risk factors and no risk factors, respectively.

Study participants were recruited from four major hospitals in Taoyuan City, Taiwan, period 2018-2020, looking into HPV infection and other PCa risk factors, including dietary habits, family history, personal lifestyle, and sexual behavior. Multiple logistic regression analysis and forward stepwise selection analysis were conducted to identify potential risk factors for PCa.

Effective therapeutic strategies against RB1-deficient cancers remain elusive. Here, we showed that RB1 loss/E2F activation sensitized cancer cells to ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation, by upregulating expression of ACSL4 and enriching ACSL4-dependent arachidonic acid-containing phospholipids, which are key components of ferroptosis execution. ACSL4 appeared to be a direct E2F target gene and was critical to RB1 loss-induced sensitization to ferroptosis. Importantly, using cell line-derived xenografts and genetically engineered tumor models, we demonstrated that induction of ferroptosis in vivo by JKE-1674, a highly selective and stable GPX4 inhibitor, blocked RB1-deficient prostate tumor growth and metastasis and led to improved survival of the mice.

Whole-slide images were annotated by a GU fellowship-trained pathologist for each Gleason pattern. High-resolution tiles were extracted from annotated and unlabeled tissue. Patients were separated into a training set of 31 patients (Cohort A, n = 9345 tiles) and a testing cohort of 16 patients (Cohort B, n = 4375 tiles). Tiles from Cohort A were used to train a ResNet model, and glands from these tiles were segmented to calculate pathomic features to train a bagged ensemble model to discriminate tumors as (1) cancer and noncancer, (2) high- and low-grade cancer from noncancer, and (3) all Gleason patterns. The outputs of these models were compared to ground-truth pathologist annotations. The ensemble and ResNet models had overall accuracies of 89% and 88%, respectively, at predicting cancer from noncancer.

Participants were divided into seven age groups. Simple descriptive statistical analyses were carried out and quartiles and 95th percentiles were calculated for each group as reference ranges for serum PSA in screening for prostate cancer in Taiwanese men. Serum PSA concentration correlated with age (r = 0.274, p<0.001). The median serum PSA concentration (5th to 95th percentile) ranged from 0.7 ng/ml (0.3 to 1.8) for men 20-29 years old (n = 6,382) to 1.6 ng/ml (0.4 to 8.4) for men over 79 years old (n = 504). The age-specific PSA reference ranges are as follows: 20-29 years, 1.80 ng/ml; 30-39 years, 1.80 ng/ml; 40-49 years, 2.0 ng/ml; 50-59 years, 3.20 ng/ml; 60-69 years, 5.60 ng/ml; 70-79 years, 7.40 ng/ml; over 80 years, 8.40 ng/ml. Almost no change occurred in the median serum PSA value in men 50 years old or younger, while a gradual increase was observed in men over 50. Taiwanese men aged 60 years above showed higher 95th percentile serum PSA values compared to Caucasian men and men in other Asian countries but were closer to those of Asian American and African American men.

Consequently, using pan-cancer research to explore the significance of PTOV1 is valuable, and may reveal novel targets for cancer treatment.  Methods:   A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of PTOV1 was performed. The qRT-PCR was utilized to confirm the aberrant PTOV1 expression in several cancer cell lines.  Results:   We observed that PTOV1 mRNA expression was high in 18 cancer tissues and was thereafter associated with poor survival prognosis in a range of malignancies. The immune subtypes of 14 malignancies and the molecular subtypes of six malignancies were related to PTOV1. A substantial association between PTOV1 and immune checkpoint (ICP) genes was also observed. Tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and DNA methylation analyses indicated that PTOV1 acts as a cancer-promoting agent in a series of tumors. In addition, an enrichment study of PTOV1 and related genes revealed that RNA splicing may be responsible for the involvement of PTOV1 in cancers. Lastly, we also verified that PTOV1 expression was elevated in bladder cancer, breast cancer, CESC, LIHC cell lines via qRT-PCR.  Conclusion:   Our bioinformatics research indicated that PTOV1 may be involved in tumor immunity. Furthermore, differentially expressed PTOV1 was found to be related to poor prognosis in cancers, and RNA splicing may be the specific mechanism for this effect. Therefore, PTOV1 mRNA and the corresponding protein may function as potential prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets in various cancers.""","""['Fashun Liu', 'Zhen Li', 'Songlin Wan', 'Yue Li', 'Zhenxiong Ye', 'Daojiang Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Curr Cancer Drug Targets""","""['A pan-cancer analysis to determine the prognostic analysis and immune infiltration of HSPA5.', 'Overexpression of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 correlates with tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'Prostate Tumor Overexpressed 1 (PTOV1) Is a Novel Prognostic Marker for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Progression and Poor Survival Outcomes.', 'The role of prostate tumor overexpressed 1 in cancer progression.']"""

Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression is prevalent in prostate cancer, preserved during malignant transformation, and increases in response to anti-androgen therapies, making it a commonly targeted tumor associated antigen for prostate cancer. JNJ-63898081 (JNJ-081) is a bispecific antibody targeting PSMA-expressing tumor cells and CD3-expressing T cells, aiming to overcome immunosuppression and promoting antitumor activity.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a phase 1 dose escalation study of JNJ-081 in patients with metastatic castration-resistance prostate cancer (mCRPC). Eligible patients included those receiving ≥1 prior line treatment with either novel androgen receptor targeted therapy or taxane for mCRPC. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of JNJ-081, and preliminary antitumor response to treatment were evaluated. JNJ-081 was administered initially by intravenous (IV) then by subcutaneous (SC) route.  Results:   Thirty-nine patients in 10 dosing cohorts received JNJ-081 ranging from 0.3 µg/kg to 3.0 µg/kg IV and 3.0 µg/kg to 60 µg/kg SC (with step-up priming used at higher SC doses). All 39 patients experienced ≥1 treatment-emergent AE, and no treatment-related deaths were reported. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 4 patients. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed at higher doses with JNJ-081 IV or SC; however, CRS and infusion-related reaction (IRR) were reduced with SC dosing and step-up priming at higher doses. Treatment doses >30 µg/kg SC led to transient PSA decreases. No radiographic responses were observed. Anti-drug antibody responses were observed in 19 patients receiving JNJ-081 IV or SC.  Conclusion:   JNJ-081 dosing led to transient declines in PSA in patients with mCRPC. CRS and IRR could be partially mitigated by SC dosing, step-up priming, and a combination of both strategies.

When a cancer patient develops a contagious disease, treatment with an anticancer drug is suspended or postponed to treat the infectious disease. If there was a drug that suppresses the growth of cancer cells among antibacterial agents, it would be possible to treat both infectious diseases and cancer. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of antibacterial agents on cancer cell development. Vancomycin (VAN) had little effect on cell proliferation against the breast cancer cell, MCF-7, prostate cancer cell, PC-3, and gallbladder cancer cell, NOZ C-1. Alternatively, Teicoplanin (TEIC) and Daptomycin (DAP) promoted the growth of some cancer cells. In contrast, Linezolid (LZD) suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7, PC-3, and NOZ C-1 cells. Therefore, we found a drug that affects the growth of cancer cells among antibacterial agents. Next, when we examined the effects of the combined use of existing anticancer and antibacterial agents, we found VAN did not affect the growth suppression by anticancer agents. However, TEIC and DAP attenuated the growth suppression of anticancer agents. In contrast, LZD additively enhanced the growth suppression by Docetaxel in PC-3 cells. Furthermore, we showed that LZD inhibits cancer cell growth by mechanisms that involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway suppression.

The immune composition of the prostate TME differs across soft tissue and bone, the most common site of treatment-refractory metastasis. Understanding immunosuppressive mechanisms specific to prostate TMEs will enable rational immunotherapy strategies to generate effective antitumor immune responses. Daratumumab (anti-CD38 antibody) and edicotinib (colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R) inhibitor) may alter the balance within the prostate TME to promote antitumor immune responses.  Hypothesis:   Daratumumab or edicotinib will be safe and will alter the immune TME, leading to antitumor responses in localized prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   In this presurgical study, patients with localized prostate cancer received 4 weekly doses of daratumumab or 4 weeks of daily edicotinib prior to radical prostatectomy (RP). Treated and untreated control (Gleason score ≥8 in prostate biopsy) prostatectomy specimens and patient-matched pre- and post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow samples were evaluated. The primary endpoint was incidence of adverse events (AEs). The secondary endpoint was pathologic complete remission (pCR) rate.  Results:   Twenty-five patients were treated (daratumumab, n=15; edicotinib, n=10). All patients underwent RP without delays. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs with daratumumab occurred in 3 patients (12%), and no ≥grade 3 treatment-related AEs occurred with edicotinib. No changes in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels or pCRs were observed. Daratumumab led to a decreased frequency of CD38+ T cells, natural killer cells, and myeloid cells in prostate tumors, bone marrow, and PBMCs. There were no consistent changes in CSF-1R+ immune cells in prostate, bone marrow, or PBMCs with edicotinib. Neither treatment induced T cell infiltration into the prostate TME.  Conclusions:   Daratumumab and edicotinib treatment was safe and well-tolerated in patients with localized prostate cancer but did not induce pCRs. Decreases in CD38+ immune cells were observed in prostate tumors, bone marrow, and PBMCs with daratumumab, but changes in CSF-1R+ immune cells were not consistently observed with edicotinib.

Due to the complicated nature of the tumour microenvironment (TME), conventional treatments face challenges including poor prognosis and tumour resistance, therefore new therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), a double-stranded non-coding RNA, regulates specific gene expression through RNA interference. Tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a potential therapeutic target in cancer immunotherapy. Colony stimulating factor-1/colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1/CSF-1R) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the polarization of the immunosuppressive TAMs, M2 macrophages. Downregulation of CSF-1R is known to reprogram the immunosuppressive TAMs, M2 macrophages, to the immunostimulatory phenotype, M1 macrophages. Sialic acid is a ligand for Siglec-1 (CD169) which is overexpressed on M2 macrophages with little expression in other phenotypes. Therefore, a sialic acid-targeted cyclodextrin-based nanoparticle was developed to specifically deliver CSF-1R siRNA to M2 macrophages. The nanoparticles were studied in vitro using both human and mouse prostate cancer cell lines. Results show that the targeted nanoparticles achieved cell specific delivery to M2 macrophages via the sialic acid-CD169 axis. The expression of CSF-1R was significantly downregulated in M2 macrophages (29.64% for targeted vs 19.31% for non-targeted nanoparticles in THP-1-derived M2 macrophages and 38.94% for targeted vs 18.51% for non-targeted nanoparticles in RAW 264.7-derived M2 macrophages, n = 4, p < 0.01). The resulting reprograming of M2 macrophages to M1 enhanced the level of apoptosis in the prostate cancer cells in a Transwell model (49.17% for targeted vs 37.68% for non-targeted nanoparticles in PC-3 cells and 69.15% for targeted vs 44.73% for non-targeted nanoparticles in TRAMP C1 cells, n = 3, p < 0.01).

Previous studies have demonstrated that cancer cells have a high rate of aerobic glycolysis that is present in nearly all invasive human cancers and persists even under normoxic conditions. Aerobic glycolysis has been correlated with chemotherapeutic resistance and tumor aggressiveness. These data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may confer a significant proliferative advantage during the somatic evolution of cancer. In this study we investigated the effect of direct mitochondria transplantation on cancer cell proliferation and chemotherapeutic sensitivity in prostate and ovarian cancer models, both in vitro and in vivo. Our results show that the transplantation of viable, respiration competent mitochondria has no effect on cancer cell proliferation but significantly decreases migration and alters cell cycle checkpoints. Our results further demonstrate that mitochondrial transplantation significantly increases chemotherapeutic sensitivity, providing similar apoptotic levels with low-dose chemotherapy as that achieved with high-dose chemotherapy. These results suggest that mitochondria transplantation provides a novel approach for early prostate and ovarian cancer therapy, significantly increasing chemotherapeutic sensitivity in in vitro and in vivo murine models.""","""['Aybuke Celik', 'Arzoo Orfany', 'Jason Dearling', 'Pedro J Del Nido', 'James D McCully', 'Filiz Bakar-Ates']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Pharmacother""","""['Noscapine Increases the Sensitivity of Drug-Resistant Ovarian Cancer Cell Line SKOV3/DDP to Cisplatin by Regulating Cell Cycle and Activating Apoptotic Pathways.', 'Overcoming cisplatin resistance of ovarian cancer cells by targeting HIF-1-regulated cancer metabolism.', 'HDAC1 Silencing in Ovarian Cancer Enhances the Chemotherapy Response.', 'PGC1α regulates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation involved in cisplatin resistance in ovarian cancer cells via nucleo-mitochondrial transcriptional feedback.', 'Direct impact of cisplatin on mitochondria induces ROS production that dictates cell fate of ovarian cancer cells.']"""

Materials:   We relied on the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database (2016-2019) and stratified RC patients according to census region (Midwest, Northeast, South, West). Primary statistical analyses consisted of THC-trend analyses and multivariable log-link linear regression models, after adjustment for hospital clustering (Generalized Estimating Equation function) and discharge disposition weighting. Finally, sensitivity analysis, relying on most favorable patient cohort, was performed.  Results:   Of 5280 eligible patients, 1441 (27%), 1031 (20%), 1854 (35%) and 954 (18%) underwent RC in the Midwest, Northeast, South and West, respectively. Median THC was 28,915$ and differed significantly between regions (Midwest: 28,105$; Northeast: 28,886$; South: 26,096$; West: 38,809$; p < 0.001). After stratification between ORC and RARC, highest THC was invariably recorded in the West: ORC 36,137$ vs 23,941-28,850$ and RARC 43,119$ vs 28,425-29,952$ (both p < 0.05). In multivariable log-link linear regression models, surgery in the West was independently associated with higher THC: ORC (Exponent beta [Exp[β]]: 1.39; 95%-CI: 1.32-1.47; p < 0.001) and RARC (Exp[β]: 1.46; 95%-CI: 1.38-1.55; p < 0.001). Results remained unchanged when analyses were refitted in most favorable patient subgroup.  Conclusions:   Important regional differences in ORC and RARC THC distinguish the West from other United States regions. The THC discrepancy clearly requires closer examination to identify underlying processes that contribute to inflated costs in the West.""","""['Benedikt Hoeh', 'Rocco Simone Flammia', 'Lukas Hohenhorst', 'Gabriele Sorce', 'Francesco Chierigo', 'Andrea Panunzio', 'Zhe Tian', 'Fred Saad', 'Michele Gallucci', 'Alberto Briganti', 'Carlo Terrone', 'Shahrokh F Shariat', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Alessandro Antonelli', 'Luis A Kluth', 'Andreas Becker', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Surg Oncol""","""['Outcomes of robotic-assisted versus open radical cystectomy in a large-scale, contemporary cohort of bladder cancer patients.', 'Propensity-matched comparison of morbidity and costs of open and robot-assisted radical cystectomies: a contemporary population-based analysis in the United States.', 'Comparative effectiveness of robot-assisted vs. open radical cystectomy.', 'Systematic review and cumulative analysis of perioperative outcomes and complications after robot-assisted radical cystectomy.', 'Systematic review and cumulative analysis of oncologic and functional outcomes after robot-assisted radical cystectomy.']"""

Methods:   A total of 103 patients who underwent 99mTc-MDP bone SPECT/CT imaging from the neck to the proximal femur were included. First, in 65 patients without bone metastases, the normal range of standardized uptake value (SUV) of non-pathological bone was evaluated to determine an SUV threshold to reliably exclude most normal osseous activity. Then, in 38 CRPC patients with bone metastases, lesion uptake volume (LUV), which is the extracted volume of bone metastases exhibiting high accumulation above the SUV threshold, was calculated. The relation between LUV and prostate-related mortality was statistically evaluated.  Results:   Based on the SUV measurements of non-pathological bones, the optimal SUV threshold, which defines abnormal bone SPECT uptake, was determined to be 8. Median LUV was 39 mL (interquartile range 4.0-104.3 mL) in the CRPC subjects with bone metastases. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a significant relation between prostate cancer-specific survival and LUV (cut-off value, 19.95 mL; P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed LUV as an independent prognostic factor for the survival (P = 0.008, hazard ratio 23.424). Global chi-square test showed that LUV had significant incremental prognostic value in addition to prostate-specific antigen and the interval from progression to CRPC until bone SPECT/CT (P = 0.022).

However, performing RARP along with a concomitant hernia repair with mesh is debatable because of the lack of well-designed studies on this subject. Some argue that this procedure may result in mesh infections and increased complications due to possible contact of mesh and urine. This study reports our experience with simultaneous hernia repair with mesh placement in patients who underwent radical prostatectomy. We compared 244 patients (from August 2008 to August 2021) who underwent RARP with concomitant hernia repair (inguinal, umbilical, and ventral) and mesh placement with 244 patients from 6275 RARPs operated on the same period without hernia repair. We performed a propensity score matching analysis using preoperative covariates and compared the perioperative outcomes, and complications in 90 days after surgery. Median follow-up was 36.6 months for the control and hernia groups respectively (p = 0.81). Eighty-three patients had unilateral inguinal hernia repair, 22 had a bilateral inguinal hernia repair, 95 had a ventral hernia repair, and 44 had an umbilical hernia repair. The median operative time was 112 min for the control group and 160 min for hernia groups (p < 0.001). We did not find statistically significant differences in minor complications (Clavien ≤ 2). Although the postoperative readmissions in 90-days were higher in the hernia group (18 vs. 7, p = 0.038), none was associated with mesh complications. Limitation includes the retrospective design of the study. Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with simultaneous hernia repair and mesh placement is safe and does not increase complications related to the mesh. In our experience, hernia repair increases the operative time, usually due to initial peritoneal flap dissection and final suturing. Therefore, we believe that hernia repair with mesh during RARP is safe and spares patients the additional impacts of an additional surgical procedure.""","""['Abdel Rahman Jaber#', 'Marcio Covas Moschovas#', 'Travis Rogers', 'Shady Saikali', 'Roshane Perera', 'D Grant Loy', 'Marco Sandri', 'Shannon Roof', 'Keila Diaz', 'Carlos Ortiz', 'Vipul Patel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Robot Surg""","""['Robotic radical prostatectomy with concomitant repair of inguinal hernia: is it safe?', 'Concurrent Repair of Inguinal Hernias with Mesh Application During Transperitoneal Robotic-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Is it Safe.', 'Simultaneous Inguinal Hernia Repair with Monofilament Polypropylene Mesh during Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Results from a Single Institute Series.', 'Minimally Invasive Hernia Repair in Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'The impact of previous laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair on radical prostatectomy.']"""

Methods:   A web-based peer navigation program was conducted for prostate cancer patients and caregivers over a 6-month time period. In a one-arm observational study, peer and caregiver navigators were asked to complete standardized mental health (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Cancer Worry Scale), quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), and social support (ENRICHD Social Support Instrument) scales pre- and post-intervention and questionnaires addressing motivations, benefits, and program satisfaction post-intervention.  Results:   Both peer and caregiver navigators reported very low anxiety and depressive symptoms across time. Cancer worry increased over time with 25% of participants exceeding the symptom threshold at baseline and 33% at follow-up. Quality of life was very high but slightly decreased over time (90.0% vs. 84.4%; p = .005), indicative of a greater number of navigators reporting pain/discomfort at follow-up. Social support was high (86.9% vs. 85.9%) and remained so. Top five role endorsements were (1) a feeling of belonging, (2) being involved in something good, (3) giving back, (4) feeling better as a person, and (5) improved communication skills. Program satisfaction was very high with support from program staff rated highest.  Conclusions:   The study indicates that peer and caregiver navigators exhibited favorable physical and mental health across time.

Painful gynecomastia (PG) is a common side effect of BMT. Few therapeutic options are available for preventing BMT-induced PG.  Objectives:   To assess the efficacy and side effects of single fraction (SF) prophylactic breast irradiation (PBI) to prevent painful gynecomastia (PG) in patients LIR-PC treated with BMT.  Methods:   We reviewed the results of bilateral PBI in a prospective cohort of LIR-PC patients who received 150 mg bicalutamide daily as a first-line treatment for at least 12 months. A single fraction of 8 Gy was administered to both breasts by a stationary field of 10 × 10 cm, using 10-15 MeV electron beam. PBI was commenced on the same day as BMT, but prior to the first dose of bicalutamide. A radiotherapy treatment plan was designed to cover breast tissue by the 90% isodose line. Subsequent monthly physical examinations were scheduled for all patients during the first year of BMT to evaluate any PG symptoms.  Results:   Seventy-six patients received BMT and PBI, 80% (61/76) showed no signs of PG; 20% (15/76) experienced mild gynecomastia. The main adverse effect of PBI was grade 1 radiation dermatitis.

Highly unfavorable findings at RP were those that if they could have been predicted preoperatively, might have factored into the decision of whether to proceed with surgery. For these purposes, highly unfavorable pathology at RP was defined as either the presence of seminal vesicle invasion or lymph node metastases or GG5 (Gleason score 9-10).  Results:   Among 37 patients with clinical follow-up data, 18 (49%) received radiation and/or hormonal therapy (RT/HT), 13 patients (35%) either underwent (n = 11) or are planning (n = 2) RP, and 6 patients (16%) received either ablation therapy or active surveillance. Based on the 11 RP pathology reports, 8 were GG2, one GG3 with tertiary pattern 5, and two GG3. Ten cases were reported to have EPE and six cases had positive margins. Only one had highly unfavorable pathology with pT3bN1 disease. The only difference between the RP and the RT/HT groups in their pretreatment parameters was the mean age of the RP patients was 61 compared with 69 for the RT/HT men (p = 0.02); the lack of many cases with highly unfavorable pathology at RP cannot be attributable to a selection bias of men with lower volume cancer on biopsy or lower serum prostate-specific antigen levels choosing RP over RT/HT.

Objectives:   To determine the 26-year risk of ADRD in association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, hypertension, and diabetes in a nationwide cohort of men with prostate cancer.  Design:   Retrospective cohort study.  Setting:   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) areas of the United States.  Participants:   351,571 men diagnosed with prostate cancer at age ≥65 years.  Measurements:   Main exposures were CVD, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes. Main outcome was the incidence of ADRD.  Results:   The crude 26-year cumulative incidence of any ADRD was higher in those with versus without CVD (33.80% vs 29.11%), stroke (40.70% vs 28.03%), hypertension (30.88% vs 27.31%), and diabetes (32.23% vs 28.68%).

Methods The expressions of interleukin-8 (IL-8), lymphocyte antigen 6G (LY6G) and citrullinated histone H3 (H3CIT) in 28 cases of tumor tissues and adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemical staining. Neutrophils were extracted from the patients and stimulated with PMA to form NETs in vitro. The up-regulated genes of DU145 cells stimulated by NETs were detected by RNA-seq, and verified by real time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis. KEGG and GO analyses of upregulated genes were performed using the DAVID database. The proliferation, invasion and migration ability of DU145 cells was assessed by CCK-8 assay, TranswellTM and scratch assay. After knockdown of IL-8 expression in DU145 cells, the changes of proliferation, invasion and migration ability of DU145 cells were tested over again. Results The expression levels of IL-8, LY6G, and H3CIT in tumor sites were significantly higher than those in adjacent tissues. After co-incubated with NETs, the expression of 638 genes including IL-8 were up-regulated in DU145 cells, which related to phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) signaling pathway, cell proliferation and invasion. NETs can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of DU145. After silencing IL-8, the ability of NETs to promote the proliferation, invasion and migration of DU145 was decreased.

Methods:   We conducted a qualitative study of multi-disciplinary health care providers treating patients with prostate cancer at a safety-net hospital. Participants completed an interview that addressed knowledge, practices, and contextual factors related to providing genetic services to patients with prostate cancer. A thematic analysis using both inductive and deductive coding was undertaken.  Results:   Seventeen providers completed interviews. Challenges in identifying eligible patients for genetic testing stemmed from a lack of a) systems that facilitate routine patient identification, and b) readily available family history data for eligibility determination. Providers identified non-medical patient characteristics that influenced their referral process, including health literacy, language, cultural beliefs, patient distress, and cost. Providers who see patients at different times along the cancer care continuum viewed benefits of testing differently.  Conclusion:   The use of digital technologies that systematically identify those eligible for genetic testing referrals may mitigate some but not all challenges identified in this study.

It involves recourse to the court system to access health services. The study aimed to evaluate whether cancer patients in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, increased their overall survival by increasing access to certain drugs or treatments through litigation, controlling for the effect of demographic and disease-related variables.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patients with breast, prostate, brain, lung, or colon cancers from 2014 to 2019 were included. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model.  Results:   In the multivariate analysis, litigation was significantly associated with increased survival in cancers of breast (HR = 0.51, 95%CI 0.33-0.80), prostate (HR = 0.50, 95%CI 0.30-0.85), colon (HR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.38-0.93), and lung (HR = 0.36, 95%CI 0.22-0.60). Five-year survival rates of patients who sued for treatment were 97.8%, 88.7%, 59.3%, and 26.0%, compared to median survival of 95.7%, 78.7%, 41.2%, and 2.4%, respectively, among patient that did not resort to court action. The study suggests that litigation for access to cancer treatment may represent a step forward in obtaining more effective treatment. This study´s main limitations are the lack of patients´ clinical information for use as control variables and the lack of variables to assess patients´ quality of life. The study also found that many cases involved claims that could have been solved by administrative rather than legal action. Some claims thus reflect the lack of adequate administrative procedures.  Conclusion:   When based on scientific evidence, access to new therapies, combined with other technologies already available, can favor patient survival. Access to new therapies through litigation may increase health inequalities since low-income patients have limited access to legal recourse against the State to meet their needs.

Methods:   In our study, we evaluated the anticancer activities of three aminothiophene derivatives: SB-44, SB-83, and SB-200, in prostate and cervical adenocarcinoma cells. Several in vitro methods were performed, including cytotoxicity, clonogenic migration, mutagenic, and cleaved Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) assays and annexin V staining.  Results:   Significant cytotoxicity was observed in cell lines with IC50 values less than 35 μM (15.38-34.04 μM). All aminothiophene derivatives significantly reduced clone formation but had no effect on cell motility. SB-83 and SB-44 induced a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G1 phase, while SB-200 derivatives significantly decreased the percentage of S/G2/M as well as induced apoptosis, with an increase of cleaved PARP. SBs compounds also showed significant mutagenic potential.

Simplified calculation approaches and geometries are usually adopted for salivary glands (SGs) dosimetry. Our aims were (i) to compare different dosimetry methods to calculate SGs absorbed doses (ADs) following [18F]-PSMA-1007 injection, and (ii) to assess the AD variation across patients and single SG components. Approach. Five patients with prostate cancer underwent sequential positron-emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) acquisitions of the head and neck, 0.5, 2 and 4 h after [18F]-PSMA-1007 injection. Parotid and submandibular glands were segmented on CT to derive SGs volumes and masses, while PET images were used to derive Time-Integrated Activity Coefficients. Average ADs to single SG components or total SG (tSG) were calculated with the following methods: (i) direct Monte Carlo simulation with GATE/GEANT4 considering radioactivity in the entire PET/CT field-of-view (MC) or in the SGs only (MCsgo); (ii) spherical model (SM) of OLINDA/EXM 2.1, adopting either patient-specific or standard ICRP89 organ masses (SMstd); (iii) ellipsoidal model (EM); (iv) MIRD approach with organS-factors from OLINDA/EXM 2.1 and OpenDose collaboration, with or without contribution from cross irradiation originating outside the SGs. The maximum percent AD difference across SG components (δmax) and across patients (Δmax) were calculated.Main results. Compared to MC, ADs to single SG components were significantly underestimated by all methods (average relative differences ranging between -11.9% and -30.5%).δmaxvalues were never below 25%.

Even though the exact cause of OSCC was not known, consumption of tobacco in any form has been reported in most of OSCC patients. OSCC is a massive invasive type of cancer which easily spreads to the distant organs. Hence treating it at appropriate time is necessary and the rate of OSCC incidence is also constantly increasing. At present, chemoradiation is the only therapy prescribed for OSCC patients which renders various side effects. Hence, the treatment with lesser side effect was of current research interest. Doxazosin (α1 adrenorecptor antagonist) had been proven to render anticancer effect in prostate, renal, hepatic, and ovarian cancers but its role in oral cancer cells was not been elucidated. Therefore, we have assessed the anticancer effect of doxazosin on oral squamous cancer cells via through the induction of apoptosis, and antioxidant property. The cytoprotective effect of doxazosin on normal Vero cells and anticancer effect on oral cancer KB cells were analyzed with MTT assay. Doxazosin antioxidant activity were analyzed by their reactivity with free radicals and metal ions by the method of FRAP, DPPH, chemilumiscence, and ORAC assay. The antioxidant levels were also assessed by TBARS, SOD, and glutathione levels, and later on apoptosis staining techniques like DCFH-DA, Rhodamine 123, and AO/EtBr stain were conducted. Apoptosis was confirmed by estimating the levels of apoptotic proteins in doxazosin-treated KB human oral cancer cells by ELISA method. The results from our study show that doxazosin is a potent antioxidant and it significantly induces apoptosis in human oral cancer by altering various cellular molecules at downstream signaling which has been depict in the results. Our study proves doxazosin as a potent anticancer drug which may be used in the treatment of oral carcinoma, if it is subjected to further research using human clinical trials.""","""['Dayuan Xing#', 'Li Li#', 'Di Meng', 'Yanhui Zhang', 'Feng Ma']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Appl Biochem Biotechnol""","""['Maspin sensitizes prostate cancer cells to doxazosin-induced apoptosis.', 'Suppression of human prostate cancer cell growth by alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonists doxazosin and terazosin via induction of apoptosis.', 'Mitochondrial impairment and downregulation of Drp1 phosphorylation underlie the antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of alantolactone on oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.', 'Kochia scoparia induces apoptosis of oral cancer cells in vitro and in heterotopic tumors.', 'Doxazosin and terazosin suppress prostate growth by inducing apoptosis: clinical significance.']"""

Methods:   Between November 2014 and December 2019, 580 consecutive patients were evaluated. Preoperative ETT levels were classified as ≤ 350 ng/dL vs. > 350 ng/dL. The associations between ETT levels and the risk of PCa progression, defined as any event of biochemical recurrence and/or local recurrence and/or distant metastases, or other clinical and pathological factors were evaluated by regression analyses.  Results:   Preoperative ETT levels resulted ≤ 350 ng/dL in 173 (29.8%) patients. Disease progression occurred in 101 (17.1%) cases. Progressing patients were more likely to present with PSA levels > 10 ng/mL, as well as with unfavorable tumor grade (ISUP 4-5) and stage (pT3b) at final pathology, but less likely to have ETT levels ≤ 350 ng/mL. On clinical multivariable Cox regression models, ETT ≤ 350 ng/mL exhibited a statistically significant protective effect on tumor progression (hazard ratio: 0.57, p = 0.013). Subjects presenting with ETT levels ≤ 350 ng/mL were less likely to harbor ISUP 4-5 tumor grade either at biopsy (odds ratio [OR]: 0.46, p = 0.028) or final pathology (OR: 0.45, p = 0.032).  Conclusions:   At PCa diagnosis, ETT, which associates with ISUP tumor grade, is an independent predictor of disease progression. Accordingly, as ETT decreases to levels ≤ 350 ng/dL, the risk of unfavorable tumor grade decreases, and a more favorable prognosis is expected. Preoperative ETT levels may allow further patient stratification along prognostic risk groups.""","""['Antonio Benito Porcaro#', 'Andrea Panunzio#', 'Emanuele Serafin', 'Alberto Bianchi', 'Sebastian Gallina', 'Giovanni Mazzucato', 'Stefano Vidiri', ""Damiano D'Aietti"", 'Rossella Orlando', 'Francesco Ditonno', 'Francesca Montanaro', 'Giulia Marafioti Patuzzo', 'Alberto Bailelli', 'Francesco Artoni', 'Stefano Zecchini Antoniolli', 'Riccardo Rizzetto', 'Matteo Brunelli', 'Salvatore Siracusano', 'Maria Angela Cerruto', 'Alessandro Tafuri', 'Alessandro Antonelli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Preoperative endogenous testosterone density predicts disease progression from localized impalpable prostate cancer presenting with PSA levels elevated up to 10\xa0ng/mL.', 'Circulating preoperative testosterone level predicts unfavourable disease at radical prostatectomy in men with International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group 1 prostate cancer diagnosed with systematic biopsies.', 'Clinical implications of endogenous testosterone density on prostate cancer progression in patients with very favorable low and intermediate risk treated with radical prostatectomy.', 'Low pretreatment serum total testosterone is associated with a high incidence of Gleason score 8-10 disease in prostatectomy specimens: data from ethnic Chinese patients with localized prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Aim:   Our objective was to perform a qualitative study to comprehensively characterize female partners' perceptions of the implications of PCa on their sex lives, as well as partners' sexual health concerns and unmet needs.  Methods:   We conducted semi-structured telephone interviews about sexual health and unmet needs with female partners of PCa survivors recruited from multiple clinical locations and support groups for PCa caregivers from September 2021 to March 2022. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and independently coded. Participants were recruited until thematic saturation was achieved.  Outcomes:   Outcomes of this study were female partner sexual health concerns and unmet needs.  Results:   Among 12 participants, the median age was 65 (range 53 to 81) years, 9 were White, the median time since their partner's PCa diagnosis was 2.25 years (range 11 months to 20 years), and a majority reported that their partner had undergone radical prostatectomy, radiation, and/or hormonal therapy. Major emergent themes pertained to the significant impact of age- and PCa-related sexual dysfunction on female sexual quality of life, the dyadic nature of sexual dysfunction and recovery, the role of the partner in coping with and adjusting to sexual dysfunction, difficulties communicating about sexual dysfunction in an intimate relationship, a lack of physician-led sexual health counseling and support, and the benefit of peer interactions and proactive information seeking in addressing unmet sexual health needs.  Clinical implications:   Future efforts should continue to explore the impact of PCa on partner sexual health and address unmet needs through sexual health education and support.  Strengths and limitations:   In this study, we identified female partners' sexual health concerns both related to and independent of PCa survivor sexual health. Limitations include exclusion of male partners of survivors and potential responder bias, as partners who agreed to participate may have experienced more sexual health concerns.  Conclusion:   We found that female partners experience PCa-related sexual dysfunction as a couple's disease, grief due to age- and PCa-related sexual losses, and a lack of physician-led sexual health counseling and information.

Identifying subgroups of patients with PCa for ICT remains a challenge. Herein, we report that basic helix-loop-helix family member e22 (BHLHE22) is upregulated in bone metastatic PCa and drives an immunosuppressive bone TME.  Methods:   In this study, the function of BHLHE22 in PCa bone metastases was clarified. We performed immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of primary and bone metastatic PCa samples, and assessed the ability to promote bone metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Then, the role of BHLHE22 in bone TME was determined by immunofluorescence (IF), flow cytometry, and bioinformatic analyses. RNA sequencing, cytokine array, western blotting, IF, IHC, and flow cytometry were used to identify the key mediators. Subsequently, the role of BHLHE22 in gene regulation was confirmed using luciferase reporter, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, DNA pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation, and animal experiments. Xenograft bone metastasis mouse models were used to assess whether the strategy of immunosuppressive neutrophils and monocytes neutralization by targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5)/colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) could improve the efficacy of ICT. Animals were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups. Moreover, we performed IHC and correlation analyses to identify whether BHLHE22 could act as a potential biomarker for ICT combination therapies in bone metastatic PCa.  Results:   Tumorous BHLHE22 mediates the high expression of CSF2, resulting in the infiltration of immunosuppressive neutrophils and monocytes and a prolonged immunocompromised T-cell status. Mechanistically, BHLHE22 binds to the CSF2 promoter and recruits PRMT5, forming a transcriptional complex. PRMT5 epigenetically activates CSF2 expression. In a tumor-bearing mouse model, ICT resistance of Bhlhe22+ tumors could be overcome by inhibition of Csf2 and Prmt5.

However, it is still challenging to develop a facile method for accurate, sensitive, and broad-spectrum isolation of living CTCs. Herein, inspired by the filopodia-extending behavior and clustered surface-biomarker of living CTCs, we present a unique bait-trap chip to achieve accurate and ultrasensitive capture of living CTCs from peripheral blood. The bait-trap chip is designed with the integration of nanocage (NCage) structure and branched aptamers. The NCage structure could ""trap"" the extended filopodia of living CTCs and resist the adhesion of filopodia-inhibited apoptotic cells, thus realizing the accurate capture (∼95% accuracy) of living CTCs independent of complex instruments. Using an in-situ rolling circle amplification (RCA) method, branched aptamers were easily modified onto the NCage structure, and served as ""baits"" to enhance the multi-interactions between CTC biomarker and chips, leading to ultrasensitive (99%) and reversible cell capture performance. The bait-trap chip successfully detects living CTCs in broad-spectrum cancer patients and achieves high diagnostic sensitivity (100%) and specificity (86%) of early prostate cancer. Therefore, our bait-trap chip provides a facile, accurate, and ultrasensitive strategy for living CTC isolation in clinical. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A unique bait-trap chip integrated with precise nanocage structure and branched aptamers was developed for the accurate and ultrasensitive capture of living CTCs. Compared with the current CTC isolation methods that are unable to distinguish CTC viability, the nanocage structure could not only ""trap"" the extended-filopodia of living CTCs, but also resist the adhesion of filopodia-inhibited apoptotic cells, thus realizing the accurate capture of living CTCs. Additionally, benefiting from the ""bait-trap"" synergistic effects generated by aptamer modification and nanocage structure, our chip achieved ultrasensitive, reversible capture of living CTCs.

This study aimed to identify the frequency at which these second malignancies occurred in England.  Methods:   Data were extracted from the National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS) on all patients diagnosed with a NEN at one of eight NEN site groups between 2012 and 2018: appendix, caecum, colon, lung, pancreas, rectum, small intestine, and stomach. WHO International Classification of Disease Edition-10 (ICD-10) codes were used to identify patients who had been diagnosed with an additional non-NEN cancer. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for tumours diagnosed after the index NEN were produced for each non-NEN cancer type by sex and site.  Results:   A total of 20,579 patients were included in the study. The most commonly occurring non-NEN cancers after NEN diagnosis were the prostate (20%), lung (20%), and breast (15%). Statistically significant SIRs were observed for non-NEN cancer of the lung (SIR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.55-2.22), colon (SIR = 1.78, 95% CI: 1.40-2.27), prostate (SIR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.31-1.86), kidney (SIR = 3.53, 95% CI: 2.72-4.59), and thyroid (SIR = 6.31, 95% CI: 4.26-9.33).

Additionally, females had a statistically significant SIR for stomach cancer (2.65, 95% CI: 1.26-5.57) and bladder cancer (SIR = 2.61, 95% CI: 1.36-5.02).  Conclusion:   This study found that patients with a NEN experienced a metachronous tumour of the lung, prostate, kidney, colon, and thyroid at a higher rate than the general population of England.

The spacer alters patient anatomy and thus requires new auto-contouring models.  Purpose:   To report the development and comprehensive evaluation of two deep-learning models for patients injected with a radio-transparent (model I) versus radiopaque (model II) spacer.  Methods and materials:   Model I was trained and cross-validated by 135 cases with transparent spacer and tested on 24 cases. Using refined training methods, model II was trained and cross-validated by the same dataset, but with the Hounsfield Unit distribution in the spacer overridden by that obtained from ten cases with opaque spacer. Model II was tested on 64 cases. The models auto-contour eight regions of interest (ROIs): spacer, prostate, proximal seminal vesicles (SVs), left and right femurs, bladder, rectum, and penile bulb. Qualitatively, each auto contour (AC), as well as the composite set, was assessed against manual contour (MC), by a radiation oncologist using a 1 (accepted directly or after minor editing), 2 (accepted after moderate editing), 3 (accepted after major editing), and 4 (rejected) scoring scale. The efficiency gain was characterized by the mean score as nearly complete [1-1.75], substantial (1.75-2.5], meaningful (2.5-3.25], and no (3.25-4.00]. Quantitatively, the geometric similarity between AC and MC was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean distance to agreement (MDA), using tolerance recommended by AAPM TG-132 Report. The results by the two models were compared to examine the outcome of the refined training methods. The large number of testing cases for model II allowed further investigation of inter-observer variability in clinical dataset. The correlation between score and DSC/MDA was studied on the ROIs with 10 or more counts of each acceptable score (1, 2, 3).  Results:   For model I/model II: the mean score was 3.63/1.30 for transparent/opaque spacer, 2.71/2.16 for prostate, 3.25/2.44 for proximal SVs, 1.13/1.02 for both femurs, 2.25/1.25 for bladder, 3.00/2.06 for rectum, 3.38/2.42 for penile bulb, and 2.79/2.20 for the composite set; the mean DSC was 0.52/0.84 for spacer, 0.84/0.85 for prostate, 0.60/0.62 for proximal SVs, 0.94/0.96 for left femur, 0.95/0.96 for right femur, 0.91/0.95 for bladder, 0.81/0.84 for rectum, and 0.65/0.65 for penile bulb; and the mean MDA was 2.9/0.9 mm for spacer, 1.9/1.7 mm for prostate, 2.4/2.3 mm for proximal SVs, 0.8/0.5 mm for left femur, 0.7/0.5 mm for right femur, 1.5/0.9 mm for bladder, 2.3/1.9 mm for rectum, and 2.2/2.2 mm for penile bulb. Model II showed significantly improved scores for all ROIs, and metrics for spacer, femurs, bladder, and rectum. Significant inter-observer variability was only found for prostate. Highly linear correlation between the score and DSC was found for the two qualified ROIs (prostate and rectum).  Conclusions:   The overall efficiency gain was meaningful for model I and substantial for model II. The ROIs meeting the clinical deployment criteria (mean score below 3.25, DSC above 0.8, and MDA below 2.5 mm) included prostate, both femurs, bladder and rectum for both models, and spacer for model II.""","""['Yi Wang', 'Graham Boyd', 'Stephen Zieminski', 'Sophia C Kamran', 'Anthony L Zietman', 'David T Miyamoto', 'Maxwell C Kirk', 'Jason A Efstathiou']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Technology assessment of automated atlas based segmentation in prostate bed contouring.', 'Evaluating the clinical acceptability of deep learning contours of prostate and organs-at-risk in an automated prostate treatment planning process.', 'Clinical Evaluation of Deep Learning and Atlas-Based Auto-Contouring of Bladder and Rectum for Prostate Radiation Therapy.', 'Absorbable Hydrogel Spacer Use in Prostate Radiotherapy: A Comprehensive Review of Phase 3 Clinical Trial Published Data.', 'Application of Hydrogel Spacer SpaceOAR Vue for Prostate Radiotherapy.']"""

The panel reviewed the available literature, identified accumulated knowledge and limitations, and released recommendations on how-to perform Doppler US in patients with acute scrotal pain.  Evidence synthesis:   Diagnosis of testicular torsion is based on clinical evaluation and investigation of the cord, the testis, and the paratesticular structures. A preliminary clinical evaluation, including history and palpation, is necessary. Grey scale US, color Doppler US and spectral analysis must be performed by a sonologist with at least level 2 competence.

Spermine has been considered as an endogenous inhibitor for prostate-confined cancer growth and its expression has shown correlation with prostate cancer growth rates. If established clinically, measurements of spermine bio-synthesis rates in prostates may predict prostate cancer growth and patient outcomes. Using rat models, we tested the feasibility of quantifying spermine bio-synthesis rates with 13 C NMR. Male Copenhagen rats (10 weeks, n = 6) were injected with uniformly 13 C-labeled L-ornithine HCl, and were sacrificed in pairs at 10, 30, and 60 min after injection. Another two rats were injected with saline and sacrificed at 30 min as controls. Prostates were harvested and extracted with perchloric acid and the neutralized solutions were examined by 13 C NMR at 600 MHz. 13 C NMR revealed measurable ornithine, as well as putrescine-spermidine-spermine syntheses in rat prostates, allowing polyamine bio-synthetic and ornithine bio-catabolic rates to be calculated. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of 13 C NMR for measuring bio-synthesis rates of ornithine to spermine enzymatic reactions in rat prostates.

Cryoablation destroys cancer tissue, releases tumor-associated antigens and creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, while dendritic cells (DCs) activate immune responses through processing of antigens. Immunotherapy combinations could enhance the anti-tumor efficacy. This open-label, single-arm, single-center phase I trial determined the safety and tolerability of combining cryoablation and autologous immature DC, without and with checkpoint inhibitors. Immune responses and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Patients with mCRPC, confirmed metastases and intact prostate gland were included. The first participants underwent prostate cryoablation with intratumoral injection of autologous DCs in a 3 + 3 design. In the second part, patients received cryoablation, the highest acceptable DC dose, and checkpoint inhibition with either ipilimumab or pembrolizumab. Sequentially collected information on adverse events, quality of life, blood values and images were analyzed by standard descriptive statistics. Neither dose-limiting toxicities nor adverse events > grade 3 were observed in the 18 participants. Results indicate antitumor activity through altered T cell receptor repertoires, and 33% durable (> 46 weeks) clinical benefit with median 40.7 months overall survival. Post-treatment pain and fatigue were associated with circulating tumor cell (CTC) presence at inclusion, while CTC responses correlated with clinical outcomes. This trial demonstrates that cryoimmunotherapy in mCRPC is safe and well tolerated, also for the highest DC dose (2.0 × 108) combined with checkpoint inhibitors.

Trophoblastic cell-surface antigen (TROP-2) is a transmembrane protein identified in prostate cancer and overexpressed in multiple malignancies. TROP-2 is a therapeutic target for antibody-drug conjugates (ADC).  Experimental design:   TROP-2 gene (TACSTD2) expression and markers of treatment resistance from prostate biopsies were analyzed using data from four previously curated cohorts of mCRPC (n = 634) and the PROMOTE study (dbGaP accession phs001141.v1.p1, n = 88). EPCAM or TROP-2-positive circulating tumor cells (CTC) were captured from peripheral blood for comparison of protein (n = 15) and gene expression signatures of treatment resistance (n = 40). We assessed the efficacy of TROP-2-targeting agents in a mouse xenograft model generated from prostate cancer cell lines.  Results:   We demonstrated that TACSTD2 is expressed in mCRPC from luminal and basal tumors but at lower levels in patients with neuroendocrine prostate cancer. Patients previously treated with ARSI showed no significant difference in TACSTD2 expression, whereas patients with detectable AR-V7 expression showed increased expression. We observed that TROP-2 can serve as a cell surface target for isolating CTCs, which may serve as a predictive biomarker for ADCs. We also demonstrated that prostate cancer cell line xenografts can be targeted specifically by labeled anti-TROP-2 agents in vivo.

However, this is a heterogeneous category that includes neoplasms with different combinations of Gleason pattern (GP) 4 and 5. Within GP4, large cribriform growth has been associated with adverse disease-specific outcomes in GG2-4 PCa. Less is known about the significance of cribriform morphology and the different histologic patterns of GP5 in GG5 PCa.  Methods and results:   In this study we evaluated the prognostic implications of cribriform morphology (either invasive or intraductal, henceforth ""cribriform"") and large solid growth or comedonecrosis (comedo/solid) in patients with GG5 PCa. One-hundred and thirty prostatectomies from a single institution were analysed. The presence of comedo/solid components was associated with a higher frequency of concurrent cribriform PCa (85.7% versus 45.9%, P < 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (44.6% versus 27%, P = 0.04), and biochemical recurrence (48.2% versus 28.4%, P = 0.03). The presence of large cribriform growth was associated with a higher frequency of extraprostatic involvement (i.e. pT3a-b; 85.3% versus 68.7%, P = 0.02), positive surgical margins (47.6% versus 29.2%, P = 0.04) and biochemical recurrence (47.6% versus. 18.7%, P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that GG5 PCa with cribriform or comedo/solid components had a higher probability of biochemical recurrence. Multivariable analysis showed that only cribriform components were an independent predictor of a higher risk of biochemical recurrence in this series.

The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with testosterone (T) combined with a nonestrogenic estrogen metabolite and a nongenotoxic estrogenic compound would all be necessary and sufficient for the induction of a high incidence of prostate cancer in the susceptible NBL rat strain.  Methods:   NBL rats were treated with low-dose testosterone via slow-release Silastic implants and with the marginally estrogenic genotoxic catechol estrogen 4-hydroxyestradiol (4OH-E2) and the nongenotoxic estrogen 2-fluoroestradiol (2F-E2) and in one experiment the aromatase inhibitor letrozole via custom-made slow-release pellets. Animals were euthanized 52 weeks after implantation and their pituitaries and prostate complexes weighed and fixed in formalin. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained step sections were prepared and examined microscopically for proliferative lesions.  Results:   Animals treated with 2F-E2, with or without the other compounds, had enlarged pituitaries demonstrating its estrogenicity. Animals treated with T, with or without the other compounds, had enlarged prostates consistent with its androgenicity. Rats treated with T plus 2F-E2 and 4OH-E2 developed a high incidence of prostatic cancer (89%), while, surprisingly, rats treated with T plus only 2F-E2 also had a high incidence of prostate cancer (95%) contradicting our initial hypothesis. To test whether the formation of E2 from T by aromatase could lead to estrogen genotoxicity and prostate carcinogenesis we then rats treated with T and 2F-E2 also with letrozole and found that it reduced prostate cancer incidence by about 50%.  Conclusions:   These findings indicate that long-term treatment with a nongenotoxic estrogen (2F-E2) and T as well as uninhibited prostatic aromatase activity generating genotoxic E2 are all required for induction of a high incidence of prostatic adenocarcinomas in NBL rats.

The Prostatype® score (P-score) is intended to guide treatment decisions for newly diagnosed PCa patients based on a three-gene signature (IGFBP3, F3, and VGLL3) and clinicopathological information obtained at diagnosis. This study evaluated association of the P-score measured in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging/transrectal ultrasound fusion-guided core needle biopsies (CNBs) and the P-score measured in radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens of PCa patients. We also evaluated the P-score association with the pathology of RP specimens. Furthermore, concordance of the P-score in paired CNB and RP specimens, as well as in index versus concomitant nonindex tumor foci from the same RP was investigated.  Methods:   The study included 100 patients with localized PCa. All patients were diagnosed by CNB and underwent RP between 2015 and 2018. Gene expression was assessed with the Prostatype® real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction kit and the P-score was calculated. Patients were categorized into three P-score risk groups according to previously defined cutoffs.  Results:   For 71 patients, sufficient CNB tumor material was available for comparison with the RP specimens. The CNB-based P-score was associated with the pathological T-stage in RP specimens (p = 0.02). Moreover, the CNB-based P-score groups were in substantial agreement with the RP-based P-score groups (weighted κ score: 0.76 [95% confidence interval, 95% CI: 0.60-0.92]; Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.83 [95% CI: 0.74-0.89]; p < 0.0001).

Materials and methods:   We identified the patients from our database who underwent a radical prostatectomy at our institution from January 1st, 2021, to June 30th, 2021.There were 112 patients identified. Patients were stratified into two groups based on the type of biopsy that confirmed prostate cancer. The mpMRI (N=50) group had a mpMRI cognitive guided transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsy performed, and the non-mpMRI group (N=62) received a classic, systemic TRUS biopsy. We compared the biopsy results with the final pathological results, and searched for undergrading or overgrading in the biopsies compared to the final histological report.  Results:   The undergrading was found in 17,7% (N=11) cases in the non-mpMRI group and in 12,0% (N=6) of cases in the mpMRI group (p=0,02, Mann-Whitney U test). No overgrading was found in our cohort. All cases of undergrading had Grade Group 1 in the biopsy report and Grade Group 2 in the final specimen report. The charasteristics of patients are listed in Table 1.  Discussion and conclusion:   In our cohort, the patients who underwent a mpMRI targeted biopsy had a lower undergrading incidence. During a systemic TRUS biopsy, the urologist targets the areas of the prostate where cancer is most commonly located, which is usually the peripheral zone of the prostate. Since different areas of the tumor have different areas of differentiation, only a low-grade part of the tumor is sometimes biopsied, which results in a sampling error. Once the prostate is removed, the whole tumor is analyzed, so the obtained pathological results related to the removed prostate are far more accurate than the analysis of prostate cores obtained by biopsy.""","""['Ivan Pezelj', 'Matea Pirša', 'Ivan Svaguša', 'Sven Nikles', 'Miroslav Tomić', 'Matej Knežević', 'Igor Tomašković', 'Božo Krušlin']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Acta Clin Croat""","""['New prostate cancer prognostic grade group (PGG): Can multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) accurately separate patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-grade cancer?', 'Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and MRI-Transrectal Ultrasound Fusion Biopsy for Index Tumor Detection: Correlation with Radical Prostatectomy Specimen.', 'Multiparametric MRI to improve detection of prostate cancer compared with transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy alone: the PROMIS study.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-transrectal ultrasound image fusion guidance of prostate biopsies: current status, challenges and future perspectives.']"""

Plexins are transmembrane receptors for semaphorins with divergent roles in many forms of cancer. We show here that prostate epithelial cell-specific expression of a mutant form of Plexin-B1 (P1597L) which was identified in metastatic deposits in patients with prostate cancer, significantly increases metastasis, in particular metastasis to distant sites, in two transgenic mouse models of prostate cancer (PbCre+Ptenfl /flKrasG12V and PbCre+Ptenfl /flp53fl/ fl ). In contrast, prostate epithelial cell-specific expression of wild-type (WT) Plexin-B1 in PbCre+Ptenfl /flKrasG12V mice significantly decreases metastasis, showing that a single clinically relevant Pro1597Leu amino-acid change converts Plexin-B1 from a metastasis-suppressor to a metastasis-promoter. Furthermore, PLXNB1P1597L significantly increased invasion of tumor cells into the prostate stroma, while PLXNB1WT reduced invasion, suggesting that Plexin-B1 has a role in the initial stages of metastasis. Deletion of RhoA/C or PDZRhoGEF in Ptenfl /flKrasG12VPLXNB1P1597L mice suppressed metastasis, implicating the Rho/ROCK pathway in this phenotypic switch. Germline deletion of Plexin-B1, to model anti-Plexin-B1 therapy, significantly decreased invasion and metastasis in both models. Our results demonstrate that Plexin-B1 plays a complex yet significant role in metastasis in mouse models of prostate cancer and is a potential therapeutic target to block the lethal spread of the disease.  Significance:   Few therapeutic targets have been identified specifically for preventing locally invasive/oligometastatic prostate cancer from becoming more widely disseminated. Our findings suggest Plexin-B1 signaling, particularly from the clinically relevant P1597L mutant, is such a target.""","""['Boris Shorning', 'Neil Trent', 'David F Griffiths', 'Thomas Worzfeld', 'Stefan Offermanns', 'Matthew J Smalley#', 'Magali Williamson#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""['Direct interaction of Rnd1 with Plexin-B1 regulates PDZ-RhoGEF-mediated Rho activation by Plexin-B1 and induces cell contraction in COS-7 cells.', 'Plexin B1 suppresses c-Met in melanoma: a role for plexin B1 as a tumor-suppressor protein through regulation of c-Met.', 'A functional role for semaphorin 4D/plexin B1 interactions in epithelial branching morphogenesis during organogenesis.', 'The Plexin-B family and its role in cancer progression.', 'Plexin structures are coming: opportunities for multilevel investigations of semaphorin guidance receptors, their cell signaling mechanisms, and functions.']"""

This study examines associations of discrimination and aging among self-identified African American survivors.  Methods:   A population-based sample of 2232 survivors 20-79 years old at diagnosis were enrolled within 5 years of breast (n = 787), colorectal (n = 227), lung (n = 223), or prostate (n = 995) cancer between 2017 and 2022. Surveys were completed post-active therapy. A deficit accumulation index measured aging-related disease and function (score range, 0-1, where <0.20 is robust, 0.20 to <0.35 is pre-frail, and 0.35+ is frail; 0.06 is a large clinically meaningful difference). The discrimination scale assessed ever experiencing major discrimination and seven types of events (score, 0-7). Linear regression tested the association of discrimination and deficit accumulation, controlling for age, time from diagnosis, cancer type, stage and therapy, and sociodemographic variables.  Results:   Survivors were an average of 62 years old (SD, 9.6), 63.2% reported ever experiencing major discrimination, with an average of 2.4 (SD, 1.7) types of discrimination events. Only 24.4% had deficit accumulation scores considered robust (mean score, 0.30 [SD, 0.13]). Among those who reported ever experiencing major discrimination, survivors with four to seven types of discrimination events (vs. 0-1) had a large, clinically meaningful increase in adjusted deficits (0.062, p < .001) and this pattern was consistent across cancer types.  Conclusion:   African American cancer survivors have high deficit accumulated index scores, and experiences of major discrimination were positively associated with these deficits.

This has been reported in multiple studies comparing it with the open approach where no statistically significant differences in complication rates have been found.2 The intrafascial approach is intended to add multiple benefits, such as not requiring continuous bladder irrigation and resection of a larger percentage of the adenoma, potentially leading to a lower reoperation rate and diagnosis of prostate cancer in patients in which this was missed preoperatively.3 OBJECTIVE: To present the resection of a very large prostate can lead to significant intraoperative challenges. Therefore, we demosntrate our intrafascial robotic management of a 470g prostate.  Materials and methods:   A 56-year-old with LUTS (IPSS: 34) for over 6 years, complicated with multiple episodes of urinary retention. PSA: 20.6 ng/mL. MRI reported a 463 cc prostate volume without focal lesions. First, the retropubic space was developed. Cystotomy was performed at the anterior bladder neck. A plane between the prostatic capsule and the surrounding fascia was dissected while carefully preserving the neurovascular bundles. Due to its large size, the prostate was divided into segments to facilitate its extraction. Hemostatic control and vesicourethral anastomosis were performed.  Results:   Discharged on postoperative day 1 with a Jackson-Pratt drain and Foley catheter removed on days 6 and 9, respectively. Pathology was negative for malignancy. Patient-reported improvement of LUTS (IPSS: 3) and preservation of erectile function (SHIM: 23) at the 3-month follow-up.

ADT-induced PCa recurrence may progress to an AR-negative phenotype with neuroendocrine (NE) histologic features, which are associated with metabolic disturbances and poor prognoses. However, the metabolic pathways that regulate NE differentiation (NED) in PCa remain unclear. Herein, we show a regulatory mechanism in NED-associated metabolism dysfunction induced by ADT, whereby overexpression of pyruvate kinase L/R (PKLR) mediates oxidative stress through upregulation of reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (ROMO1), thereby promoting NED and aggressiveness. ADT mediates the nuclear translocation of PKLR, which binds to the MYCN/MAX complex to upregulate ROMO1 and NE-related genes, leading to altered mitochondrial function and NED of PCa. Targeting nuclear PKLR/MYCN using bromodomain and extra-terminal motif (BET) inhibitors has the potential to reduce PKLR/MYCN-driven NED. Abundant ROMO1 in serum samples may provide prognostic information in patients with ADT.

Using MV images for real-time image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is ideal as it does not require additional imaging equipment, adds no additional imaging dose and provides motion data in the treatment beam frame of reference. However, accurate tracking using MV images is challenging due to low contrast and modulated fields. Here, a novel real-time marker tracking system based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was developed and evaluated on retrospectively acquired patient data for MV-based IGRT for prostate cancer patients.Approach. MV images, acquired from 29 volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) prostate cancer patients treated in a multi-institutional clinical trial, were used to train and evaluate a CNN-based marker tracking system. The CNN was trained using labelled MV images from 9 prostate cancer patients (35 fractions) with implanted markers. CNN performance was evaluated on an independent cohort of unseen MV images from 20 patients (78 fractions), using a Precision-Recall curve (PRC), area under the PRC plot (AUC) and sensitivity and specificity. The accuracy of the tracking system was evaluated on the same unseen dataset and quantified by calculating mean absolute (±1 SD) and [1st, 99th] percentiles of the geometric tracking error in treatment beam co-ordinates using manual identification as the ground truth.Main results.

The mean absolute geometric tracking error was 0.30 ± 0.27 and 0.35 ± 0.31 mm in the lateral and superior-inferior directions of the MV images, respectively. The [1st, 99th] percentiles of the error were [-1.03, 0.90] and [-1.12, 1.12] mm in the lateral and SI directions, respectively.Significance. The high classification performance on unseen MV images demonstrates the CNN can successfully identify implanted prostate markers.

In this sense, normal mitochondria were first isolated from human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human embryonic kidney cells and were later transferred into PC-3 cells and rhodamine 6G-treated PC-3 cells exhibiting mitochondrial dysfunction. Next, cell proliferation and sensitivity to cisplatin were measured using Cell Counting Kit-8 and the Malondialdehyde Assay Lipid Peroxidation Kit, respectively, along with ferroptotic damage. Transferring the healthy mitochondria into PC-3 cells was observed to increase cell proliferation and rescue the cisplatin-induced cell death, but not the erastin-induced ferroptosis, as in mitochondrial transfer effectively enhanced erastin-mediated ferroptosis in PC-3 cells.

Methods:   We included 102 patients who underwent transperineal cognitive fusion targeted biopsy for Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System 4/5 lesions in the transition zone between 2016 and 2020. The association between apparent diffusion coefficients and prostate cancers in the transition zone was analyzed.  Results:   The detection rate of prostate cancer was 49% (50/102), including clinically significant prostate cancer in 37.3% (38/102) of patients. The minimum apparent diffusion coefficients in patients with clinically significant prostate cancer were 494.5 ± 133.6 µm2/s, which was significantly lower than 653.8 ± 172.5 µm2/s in patients with benign histology or clinically insignificant prostate cancer. Age, prostate volume, transition zone volume, and mean and minimum apparent diffusion coefficients were associated with clinically significant prostate cancer. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient value (odds ratio: 0.994; p < 0.001) was an independent predictor of clinically significant prostate cancer. When the cutoff value of the minimum apparent diffusion coefficient was less than 595 µm2/s, indicating the presence of prostate cancer in the transition zone, the detection rate increased to 59.2% (29/49) in this cohort.

To inform policies regarding genomic testing strategies, we propose a simple metric, cost per correctly identified patient (CCIP), that compares sequential single-gene testing (SGT) vs. multiplex NGS in different tumor types.  Materials and methods:   A genomic testing cost calculator was developed based on clinically actionable genomic alterations identified in the European Society for Medical Oncology Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets. Using sensitivity/specificity data for SGTs (immunohistochemistry, polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization) and NGS and marker prevalence, the number needed to predict metric was monetarized to estimate CCIP.  Results:   At base case, CCIP was lower with NGS than sequential SGT for advanced/metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), breast, colorectal, gastric cancers, and cholangiocarcinoma. CCIP with NGS was also favorable for squamous NSCLC, pancreatic, and hepatic cancers, but with overlapping confidence intervals. CCIP favored SGT for prostate cancer. Alternate scenarios using different price estimates for each test showed similar trends, but with incremental changes in the magnitude of difference between NGS and SGT, depending on price estimates for each test.  Conclusions:   The cost to correctly identify clinically actionable genomic alterations was lower for NGS than sequential SGT in most cancer types evaluated. Decreasing price estimates for NGS and the rapid expansion of targeted therapies and accompanying biomarkers are anticipated to further support NGS as a preferred diagnostic standard for precision oncology.""","""['Albrecht Stenzinger', 'Brian Cuffel', 'Noman Paracha', 'Eric Vail', 'Jesus Garcia-Foncillas', 'Clifford Goodman', 'Ulrik Lassen', 'Gilles Vassal', 'Sean D Sullivan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Oncologist""","""['Diagnostic Value and Cost-Effectiveness of Next-Generation Sequencing-Based Testing for Treatment of Patients with Advanced/Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer in the United\xa0States.', 'Utility of incorporating next-generation sequencing (NGS) in an Asian non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) population: Incremental yield of actionable alterations and cost-effectiveness analysis.', 'High concordance of actionable genomic alterations identified between circulating tumor DNA-based and tissue-based next-generation sequencing testing in advanced non-small cell lung cancer: The Korean Lung Liquid Versus Invasive Biopsy Program.', 'Recommendations for the use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for patients with metastatic cancers: a report from the ESMO Precision Medicine Working Group.', 'Diagnostic and economic value of biomarker testing for targetable mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer: a literature review.']"""

Wound healing and cell invasion assays were performed using the control (basal level of cellular function) and treated DU‑145 cells. At 24 h of treatment, 17β‑estradiol (E2), the ERα‑selective agonist, 4,4',4""‑(4‑propyl‑(1H)‑pyrazole‑1,3,5‑triyl)trisphenol (PPT), or the ERβ‑selective agonist, 2,3‑bis(4‑hydroxyphenyl)‑propionitrile (diarylprepionitrile; DPN), increased the migration and invasion of the DU‑145 cells. Pre‑treatment with the ERα‑ and ERβ‑selective antagonists blocked these effects, indicating that ERα and ERβ are upstream receptors regulating these processes. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining for the detection of the GAL‑3 were performed using the control and treated DU‑145 cells. Treatment of the DU‑145 cells with E2, PPT or DPN for 24 h increased the expression of the GAL‑3 compared to the control. Furthermore, a specific inhibitor of GAL‑3 (VA03) inhibited the migration and invasion of DU‑145 cells, indicating the involvement of the complex ERα/GAL‑3 and ERβ/GAL‑3 in the regulation of these processes. On the whole, the present study demonstrates that the activation of both ERs increases the expression and signaling of GAL‑3, and promotes the migration and invasion of DU‑145 cells.

However, the identification and monitoring of AS candidates remains challenging. Microultrasound (microUS) is a novel high-resolution imaging modality for transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS). We explored the impact of microUS TRUS and targeted biopsies in mpMRI-guided confirmatory biopsies.  Methods:   Between October 2017 and September 2021, we prospectively enrolled 100 patients scheduled for MRI-guided confirmatory biopsy at 1 year from diagnosis of ISUP 1 PCa. TRUS was performed using the ExactVu microUS system; PRI-MUS protocol was applied to identify suspicious lesions (i.e., PRIMUS score ≥ 3). All patients received targeted biopsies of any identified microUS and mpMRI lesions and complementary systematic biopsies. The proportion of patients upgraded to clinically significant PCa (defined as ISUP ≥ 2 cancer; csPCa) at confirmatory biopsies was determined, and the diagnostic performance of microUS and mpMRI were compared.  Results:   Ninety-two patients had a suspicious MRI lesion classified PI-RADS 3, 4, and 5 in respectively 28, 16, and 18 patients. MicroUS identified 82 patients with suspicious lesions, classified as PRI-MUS 3, 4, and 5 in respectively 20, 50, and 12 patients, while 18 individuals had no lesions. Thirty-four patients were upgraded to ISUP ≥ 2 cancer and excluded from AS. MicroUS and mpMRI showed a sensitivity of 94.1% and 100%, and an NPV of 88.9% and 100%, respectively, in detecting ISUP ≥ 2 patients. A microUS-mandated protocol would have avoided confirmatory biopsies in 18 patients with no PRI-MUS ≥ 3 lesions at the cost of missing four upgraded patients.  Conclusions:   MicroUS and mpMRI represent valuable imaging modalities showing high sensitivity and NPV in detecting csPCa, thus allowing their use for event-triggered confirmatory biopsies in AS patients.

The effect of tumour genotype on synergy is largely unexplored.  Methods:   The effect of seven dietary phytochemicals, quercetin (0-100 μM), curcumin (0-80 μM), genistein, indole-3-carbinol (I3C), equol, resveratrol and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) (each 0-200 μM), alone and in all paired combinations om cell viability of the androgen-responsive, pTEN-null (LNCaP), androgen-independent, pTEN-null (PC-3) or androgen-independent, pTEN-positive (DU145) prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines was determined using a high throughput alamarBlue® assay. Synergy, additivity and antagonism were modelled using Bliss additivism and highest single agent equations. Patterns of maximum synergy were identified by polygonogram analysis. Network pharmacology approaches were used to identify interactions with known PCa protein targets.  Results:   Synergy was observed with all combinations. In LNCaP and PC-3 cells, I3C mediated maximum synergy with five phytochemicals, while genistein was maximally synergistic with EGCG. In contrast, DU145 cells showed resveratrol-mediated maximum synergy with equol, EGCG and genistein, with I3C mediating maximum synergy with only quercetin and curcumin. Knockdown of pTEN expression in DU145 cells abrogated the synergistic effect of resveratrol without affecting the synergy profile of I3C and quercetin.  Discussion:   Our study identifies patterns of synergy that are dependent on tumour cell genotype and are independent of androgen signaling but are dependent on pTEN. Despite evident cell-type specificity in both maximally-synergistic combinations and the pathways that phytochemicals modulate, these combinations interact with similar prostate cancer protein targets. Here, we identify an approach that, when coupled with advanced data analysis methods, may suggest optimal dietary phytochemical combinations for individual consumption based on tumour molecular profile.Graphical abstract.""","""['Carol A Gano', 'Shadma Fatima', 'Timothy W Failes', 'Gregory M Arndt', 'Mila Sajinovic', 'David Mahns', 'Ahmad Saedisomeolia', 'Jens R Coorssen', 'Joseph Bucci', 'Paul de Souza', 'Fatemeh Vafaee', 'Kieran F Scott']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Nutr""","""['Synergistic and Selective Cancer Cell Killing Mediated by the Oncolytic Adenoviral Mutant AdΔΔ and Dietary Phytochemicals in Prostate Cancer Models.', 'Detrimental effect of cancer preventive phytochemicals silymarin, genistein and epigallocatechin 3-gallate on epigenetic events in human prostate carcinoma DU145 cells.', 'Targeting CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cell proliferation and gene expression by combinations of the phytochemicals EGCG, genistein and quercetin.', 'Cell signaling and regulators of cell cycle as molecular targets for prostate cancer prevention by dietary agents.', 'Co-administration of curcumin with other phytochemicals improves anticancer activity by regulating multiple molecular targets.']"""

A better understanding of responders and nonresponders to BAT would be useful to clinicians considering BAT therapy for patients. Herein we analyze clinical and genetic factors in responders/nonresponders to better refine our understanding regarding which patients benefit from this innovative therapy.  Methods:   mCRPC patients were assessed for response or no response to BAT. Patients with PSA declines of greater than 50% from baseline after 2 or more doses of testosterone were considered to be responders. Whereas, nonresponders had no PSA decline after 2 doses of testosterone and subsequently manifest a PSA increase of >50%. Differences between these two groups of patients were analyzed using clinical and laboratory parameters. All patients underwent genomic testing using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and germline testing pre-BAT.  Results:   Twenty five patients were nonresponders and 16 were responders. Baseline characteristics between nonresponders and responders varied. Responders were more likely to have had a radical prostatectomy as definitive therapy and were more likely to have been treated with an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist (enzalutamide or apalutamide) immediately before BAT (compared to abiraterone). Duration of prior enzalutamide therapy was longer in responders. Nonresponders were more likely to have bone-only metastases and responders were more likely to have nodal metastases. Assays detected ctDNA AR amplifications more often in responding patients. Responders trended toward having the presence of more TP53 mutations at baseline.  Conclusions:   BAT responders are distinct from nonresponders in several ways however each of these distinctions are imperfect. Patterns of metastatic disease, prior therapies, duration of prior therapies, and genomics each contribute to an understanding of patients that will or will not respond.

Methods:   A structured report for follow-up pelvic mpMRI for advanced prostate cancer (APC) patients was formulated based on MET-RADS-P guidelines. In total, 163 paired pelvic mpMRI examinations were performed from December 2017 to February 2021 on 105 patients with APC. These were retrospectively reviewed by two senior and two junior radiologists for metastatic lesion detection and were categorized by these readers using primary/secondary response assessment categories (RACs), with and without the structured report. Interreader agreement regarding metastasis detection and RAC scores was evaluated with Cohen's kappa and weighted Cohen's kappa statistics (K), respectively.  Results:   The two senior radiologists showed higher agreement with the reference standard for metastasis detection using the structured report (S1: K = 0.83; S2: K = 0.73) compared with the conventional report (S1: K = 0.72; S2: K = 0.61). Junior radiologists showed similar results (J1: 0.66 vs. 0.59; J2: 0.65 vs. 0.57).

Although some patients can be cured and the majority of patients have a long survival, the 5-year biochemical failure rate is currently 29-47%. [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 has shown impressive clinical and biochemical responses with low toxicity in salvage setting in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. This study aims to explore the combination of standard EBRT and ADT complemented with a single administration of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in curative intent treatment for N1M0 prostate cancer. Hypothetically, this combined approach will enhance EBRT to better control macroscopic tumour localizations, and treat undetected microscopic disease locations inside and outside EBRT fields.  Methods:   The PROQURE-I study is a multicenter prospective phase I study investigating standard of care treatment (7 weeks EBRT and 3 years ADT) complemented with one concurrent cycle (three, six, or nine GBq) of systemic [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 administered in week two of EBRT. A maximum of 18 patients with PSMA-positive N1M0 prostate cancer will be included. The tolerability of adding [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 will be evaluated using a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) dose-escalation design. The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a single cycle [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 when given concurrent with EBRT + ADT, defined as the occurrence of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 5.0 grade three or higher acute toxicity. Secondary objectives include: late toxicity at 6 months, dosimetric assessment, preliminary biochemical efficacy at 6 months, quality of life questionnaires, and pharmacokinetic modelling of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617.  Discussion:   This is the first prospective study to combine EBRT and ADT with [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in treatment naïve men with N1M0 prostate cancer, and thereby explores the novel application of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in curative intent treatment. It is considered likely that this study will confirm tolerability as the combined toxicity of these treatments is expected to be limited. Increased efficacy is considered likely since both individual treatments have proven high anti-tumour effect as mono-treatments.  Trial registration:   ClinicalTrials, NCT05162573 .

To identify biological bases for this health disparity, we sought to create a state-wide biobank of African American prostate cancer survivors in Florida.  Methods:   African American men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2013 and 2017 and living in Florida at diagnosis were identified through the State of Florida's cancer registry. Individuals were approached via mail and telephone, assessed for eligibility, and asked for informed consent. χ2 and t tests were conducted to identify differences between eligible and reachable individuals (i.e., had valid contact information) versus consented participants.  Results:   Of the 5,960 eligible and reachable individuals, 3,904 were eligible and contacted at least once, and 578 consented [overall consent rate = 10% (578/5,960); adjusted consent rate = 15% (578/3,904)]. Statistically significant (Ps < 0.05) but small differences in demographic and clinical variables were observed. Consented participants were less likely to be older than 64 (35% vs. 41%) and less likely to have received radiotherapy (36% vs. 41%) and hormone therapy (16% vs. 21%), but more likely to have regional prostate cancer (13% vs. 11%) and have undergone surgery (44% vs. 39%). Consented participants did not differ from reachable individuals on other demographic and clinical factors (Ps > 0.05).

In radiotherapy, the internal movement of organs between treatment sessions causes errors in the final radiation dose delivery. To assess the need for adaptation, motion models can be used to simulate dominant motion patterns and assess anatomical robustness before delivery. Traditionally, such models are based on principal component analysis (PCA) and are either patient-specific (requiring several scans per patient) or population-based, applying the same set of deformations to all patients. We present a hybrid approach which, based on population data, allows to predict patient-specific inter-fraction variations for an individual patient.Approach. We propose a deep learning probabilistic framework that generates deformation vector fields warping a patient's planning computed tomography (CT) into possible patient-specific anatomies. This daily anatomy model (DAM) uses few random variables capturing groups of correlated movements. Given a new planning CT, DAM estimates the joint distribution over the variables, with each sample from the distribution corresponding to a different deformation. We train our model using dataset of 312 CT pairs with prostate, bladder, and rectum delineations from 38 prostate cancer patients. For 2 additional patients (22 CTs), we compute the contour overlap between real and generated images, and compare the sampled and 'ground truth' distributions of volume and center of mass changes.Results. With a DICE score of 0.86 ± 0.05 and a distance between prostate contours of 1.09 ± 0.93 mm, DAM matches and improves upon previously published PCA-based models, using as few as 8 latent variables. The overlap between distributions further indicates that DAM's sampled movements match the range and frequency of clinically observed daily changes on repeat CTs.Significance. Conditioned only on planning CT values and organ contours of a new patient without any pre-processing, DAM can accurately deformations seen during following treatment sessions, enabling anatomically robust treatment planning and robustness evaluation against inter-fraction anatomical changes.""","""['Oscar Pastor-Serrano', 'Steven Habraken', 'Mischa Hoogeman', 'Danny Lathouwers', 'Dennis Schaart', 'Yusuke Nomura', 'Lei Xing', 'Zoltán Perkó']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Evaluation of a commercial DIR platform for contour propagation in prostate cancer patients treated with IMRT/VMAT.', 'Evaluations of an adaptive planning technique incorporating dose feedback in image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer.', 'A novel approach for establishing benchmark CBCT/CT deformable image registrations in prostate cancer radiotherapy.', 'Use of deformed intensity distributions for on-line modification of image-guided IMRT to account for interfractional anatomic changes.', 'Dosimetric treatment course simulation based on a statistical model of deformable organ motion.']"""

The delivery of intensity-modulated radiation fields has improved the conformity of dose to tumour targets during radiotherapy (RT). Previously, it has been shown that intercellular communication between cells positioned in- and outside of the radiation field impacts cellular radiosensitivity under hypoxic and normoxic conditions. However, the mechanism of intercellular communication in hypoxia remains to be fully understood. In this study, the cell-killing effects of intercellular communication in hypoxia were modelled in an effort to better understand the underlying mechanisms of response.Approach. By irradiating a 50% area of the culture dish (half-field exposure), experimental dose-response curves for cell survival and residual DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were generated in prostate (DU145) and non-small cell lung cancer (H1299) cells. The oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) was determined from early DSB yields (corresponding to relative direct damage) and used to model the in- and out-of-field radiosensitivity.Main results. The developed integrated microdosimetric-kinetic (IMK) model successfully predicted the experimental dose responses for survival and lethal lesions, and provides a mechanistic interpretation that the probability of hits for releasing cell-killing signals is dependent on oxygen. This experimental and modelling study also suggests that residual DSBs correspond to logarithmic survival fraction (meaning lethal lesions) for in- and out-of-field cells. Our data suggest that the OER value determined using uniform-field exposure can be applied to predict the in- and out-of-field radiosensitivity of cells following exposure to intensity modulated beams.Significance. The developed IMK model facilitates a more precise understanding of intercellular signalling following exposure to intensity-modulated radiation fields.""","""['Yusuke Matsuya', 'Stephen J McMahon', 'Karl T Butterworth', 'Yoshie Yachi', 'Ryo Saga', 'Tatsuhiko Sato', 'Kevin M Prise']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Oxygen enhancement ratios of cancer cells after exposure to intensity modulated x-ray fields: DNA damage and cell survival.', 'The Impact of Hypoxia on Out-of-Field Cell Survival after Exposure to Modulated Radiation Fields.', 'DNA damage responses following exposure to modulated radiation fields.', 'RBE-LET relationships for different types of lethal radiation damage in mammalian cells: comparison with DNA dsb and an interpretation of differences in radiosensitivity.', 'A comparison of mechanism-inspired models for particle relative biological effectiveness (RBE).']"""

Here, we evaluate the impact of an expanded definition of family history on active surveillance outcomes.  Materials and methods:   Patients undergoing active surveillance for prostate cancer at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1997-2019 with detailed data available on family cancer history were identified. Primary outcome was biopsy progression-free survival, and secondary outcomes were treatment-free survival, adverse pathological features at prostatectomy, and biochemical recurrence after treatment. Statistical analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.  Results:   Among 855 evaluable patients, 300 (35.1%) patients had any family history of prostate cancer, and 95 (11.1%) had a family history of related malignancies suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome. Family history of prostate cancer alone was not associated with biopsy progression, whereas family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with a significantly increased risk of biopsy progression (HR 1.43, 95%CI 1.01-2.02), independent of other known clinicopathological risk factors in multivariable analysis. Similarly, family history suggestive of a hereditary cancer syndrome was associated with significantly lower treatment-free survival (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.14-2.18) in multivariable analysis.

However, the association between continuity of care and outcomes across different racial groups remains unclear.  Objective:   To assess the association of provider continuity of care with outcomes among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with advanced prostate cancer and its variation by race.  Design:   Retrospective cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data.  Subjects:   African American and white Medicare beneficiaries aged 66 or older, and diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer between 2000 and 2011. At least 5 years of follow-up data for the cohort was used.  Measures:   Short-term outcomes were emergency room (ER) visits, hospitalizations, and cost during acute survivorship phase (2-year post-diagnosis), and mortality (all-cause and prostate cancer-specific) during the follow-up period. We calculated continuity of care using Continuity of Care Index (COCI) and Usual Provider Care Index (UPCI), for all visits, oncology visits, and primary care visits in acute survivorship phase. We used Poisson models for ER visits and hospitalizations, and log-link GLM for cost. Cox model and Fine-Gray competing risk models were used for survival analysis, weighted by propensity score. We performed similar analysis for continuity of care in the 2-year period following acute survivorship phase.  Results:   One unit increase in COCI was associated with reduction in short-term ER visits (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.67), hospitalizations (IRR = 0.65, 95% CI 0.64, 0.67), and cost (0.64, 95% CI 0.61, 0.66) and lower hazard of long-term mortality. Magnitude of these associations differed between African American and white patients. We observed comparable results for continuity of care in the follow-up period.  Conclusions:   Continuity of care was associated with improved outcomes. The benefits of higher continuity of care were greater for African Americans, compared to white patients. Advanced prostate cancer survivorship care must integrate appropriate strategies to promote continuity of care.""","""['Ravishankar Jayadevappa', 'Thomas Guzzo', 'Neha Vapiwala', 'Stanley Bruce Malkowicz', 'Joseph J Gallo', 'Sumedha Chhatre']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Continuity of care in acute survivorship phase, and short and long-term outcomes in prostate cancer patients.', 'Understanding the Racial and Ethnic Differences in Cost and Mortality Among Advanced Stage Prostate Cancer Patients (STROBE).', 'Racial Differences in the Surgical Care of Medicare Beneficiaries With Localized Prostate Cancer.', 'Variation in quality of care among older men with localized prostate cancer.', 'The burden of depression in prostate cancer.']"""

However, spontaneous, non-periodic displacement or drift of the target may completely change the treatment geometry. Simple motion compensation is not sufficient to guarantee the best possible treatment, since relative motion between the target and organs at risk (OARs) can cause substantial deviations of dose in the OARs. This is especially evident when considering the temporally heterogeneous dose delivery by many focused beams which is typical for robotic SBRT. Instead, a reoptimization of the remaining treatment plan after a large target motion during the treatment could potentially reduce the actually delivered dose to OARs and improve target coverage. This reoptimization task, however, is challenging due to time constraints and limited human supervision.  Purpose:   To study the detrimental effect of spontaneous target motion relative to surrounding OARs on the delivered dose distribution and to analyze how intra-fractional constrained replanning could improve motion compensated robotic SBRT of the prostate.  Methods:   We solve the inverse planning problem by optimizing a linear program. When considering intra-fractional target motion resulting in a change of geometry, we adapt the linear program to account for the changed dose coefficients and delivered dose. We reduce the problem size by only reweighting beams from the reference treatment plan without motion. For evaluation we simulate target motion and compare our approach for intra-fractional replanning to the conventional compensation by synchronous beam motion. Results are generated retrospectively on data of 50 patients.  Results:   Our results show that reoptimization can on average retain or improve coverage in case of target motion compared to the reference plan without motion. Compared to the conventional compensation, coverage is improved from 87.83 % to 94.81 % for large target motion. Our approach for reoptimization ensures fixed upper constraints on the dose even after motion, enabling safer intra-fraction adaption, compared to conventional motion compensation where overdosage in OARs can lead to 21.79 % higher maximum dose than planned. With an average reoptimization time of 6 s for 200 reoptimized beams our approach shows promising performance for intra-fractional application.  Conclusions:   We show that intra-fractional constrained reoptimization for adaption to target motion can improve coverage compared to the conventional approach of beam translation while ensuring that upper dose constraints on VOIs are not violated.""","""['Stefan Gerlach', 'Theresa Hofmann', 'Christoph Fürweger', 'Alexander Schlaefer']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Med Phys""","""['Comparison of online IGRT techniques for prostate IMRT treatment: adaptive vs repositioning correction.', 'Sequential monoscopic image-guided motion compensation in tomotherapy stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer.', 'Real-time adaptive planning method for radiotherapy treatment delivery for prostate cancer patients, based on a library of plans accounting for possible anatomy configuration changes.', 'Adaptive liver stereotactic body radiation therapy: automated daily plan reoptimization prevents dose delivery degradation caused by anatomy deformations.', 'Intraoperative dynamic dose optimization in permanent prostate implants.']"""

Our laboratory recently identified a novel mechanism of AR regulation via the transmembrane protein transmembrane 4 superfamily 3 (TM4SF3), which exhibits a physical interaction, nuclear colocalization, and mutual stabilization with AR. Here, we have mapped the interaction domains within AR and TM4SF3 and discovered that TM4SF3 also physically interacts with AR-V7, regulating its protein stability and the viability of CRPC cells expressing AR-V7. Ubiquitination of TM4SF3 and AR-V7 was detected for the first time and TM4SF3 interaction with either AR or AR-V7 resulted in mutual deubiquitination of both proteins, showing that mutual stabilization results from deubiquitination. Interestingly, nuclear TM4SF3 was co-recruited to the promoters of AR- and AR-V7-regulated genes and required for their expression, showing that TM4SF3 interaction is critical for their transcriptional functions.

Blood samples were obtained from 49 male patients with primary prostate adenocarcinoma. Thirty blood donors were included as a control group. The obtained next-generation sequencing data were analyzed using a bioinformatic pipeline for virus metagenomics. Viral reads with higher abundance were assembled in contigs and analyzed taxonomically. Viral agents of interest were also confirmed by qPCR. Anelloviruses and the Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) were the most abundant component of plasma metavirome. Clinically important viruses like hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus and human adenovirus type C were also identified. In comparison, the blood donor virome was exclusively composed of torque teno virus types (TTV) types. The performed HPgV-1 and HCV phylogeny revealed that these viruses belong to commonly detected in Brazil genotypes. Our study sheds light on the plasma viral abundance in patients with prostatic cancer.

Methods:   The work used data on all deaths of Polish residents aged over 65 years (N = 5,496,970). The analysis included the five most common major groups of causes of death: diseases of the circulatory system, malignant neoplasms, diseases of the respiratory system, diseases of the digestive system and external causes of mortality. The analysis of time trends has been carried out with the use of joinpoint models. The Annual Percentage Change (APC) for each segments of broken lines, the Average Annual Percentage Change (AAPC) for the whole study period (95% CI), and standardized death rates (SDRs) were calculated.  Results:   The percentage of deaths due to diseases of the circulatory system decreased in all the studied subgroups. Among malignant neoplasms, lung and bronchus cancers accounted for the largest percentage of deaths, for which the SDRs among men decreased, while those among women increased. In the early old age, the SDR value increased from 67.8 to 76.3 (AAPC = 0.6%, p > 0.05), while in the late old age group it increased from 112.1 to 155.2 (AAPC = 1.8%, p < 0.05). Among men, there was an upward trend for prostate cancer (AAPC = 0.4% in the early old age group and AAPC = 0.6% in the late old age group, p > 0.05) and a downward trend for stomach cancer (AAPC -3.2 and -2.7%, respectively, p < 0.05). Stomach cancer also showed a decreasing trend among women (AAPC -3.2 and -3.6%, p < 0.05). SDRs due to influenza and pneumonia were increasing. Increasing trends in mortality due to diseases of the digestive system in women and men in the early old age group have been observed in recent years, due to alcoholic liver disease.

It is necessary to analyze the expressions and regulatory roles of DLAT in tumors systematically.  Methods:   Online public-platform literature on the relationships between DLAT expression levels and tumor prognosis, methylation status, genetic alteration, drug sensitivity, and immune infiltration has been reviewed. The literature includes such documents as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Human Protein Atlas (HPA), Tumor Immune Estimation Resource 2.0 (TIMER2.0), Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2 (GEPIA2) and Receiver Operating Characteristic plotter (ROC plotter). The molecular mechanisms of DLAT were explored with the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). The relationship between down-regulated DLAT and autophagy in two liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) cell lines was confirmed with the western blot method, colony formation assay, and transmission electron microscopy. Tissue microarrays were validated through the immunohistochemical staining of DLAT.  Results:   DLAT is upregulated in the LIHC, lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) tumors but is down-regulated in the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC) tumors in comparison with normal tissues. For LIHC patients treated with 5-Fluorouracil and Lenvatinib, the DLAT levels of those in the drug-resistant group are significantly high. In LIHC cells, autophagy will be inhibited, and cell death will be induced when DLAT breaks down. Moreover, there exist positive correlations between DLAT expression levels and infiltration of B cells, DC cells, Tregs, and CD8+ T cells in kidney chromophobe (KICH), breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA), prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD), LIHC and HPV+ HNSC. In LIHC, markers of Tregs are positively correlated with DLAT. Compared with those of normal tissues, the staining intensity of DLAT and the amount of Tregs marker CD49d in LIHC increase.  Conclusions:   Through this study, the expressions of DLAT in various cancer types can be understood comprehensively. It suggests that DLAT may be a prognostic marker for LIHC, LUAD, LUSC, STAD and KIRC. A high DLAT expression in LIHC may promote tumorigenesis by stimulating autophagy and inhibiting anti-tumor immunity.""","""['Qinjing Yang#', 'Shuangshuang Zeng#', 'Wei Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Pan-Cancer Analysis of PARP1 Alterations as Biomarkers in the Prediction of Immunotherapeutic Effects and the Association of Its Expression Levels and Immunotherapy Signatures.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'Distinct Roles of Adenosine Deaminase Isoenzymes ADA1 and ADA2: A Pan-Cancer Analysis.', 'The cancer driver genes IDH1/2, JARID1C/ KDM5C, and UTX/ KDM6A: crosstalk between histone demethylation and hypoxic reprogramming in cancer metabolism.', 'Good or not good: Role of miR-18a in cancer biology.']"""

CACNA1D, encoding CaV1.3 ion channels is upregulated in prostate cancer. Here we show how hormone therapy affects CACNA1D expression and CaV1.3 function. Human prostate cells (LNCaP, VCaP, C4-2B, normal RWPE-1) and a tissue microarray were used. Cells were treated with anti-androgen drug, Enzalutamide (ENZ) or androgen-removal from media, mimicking androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Proliferation assays, qPCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, Ca2+-imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology were performed. Nifedipine, Bay K 8644 (CaV1.3 inhibitor, activator), mibefradil, Ni2+ (CaV3.2 inhibitors) and high K+ depolarising solution were employed. CACNA1D and CaV1.3 protein are overexpressed in prostate tumours and CACNA1D was overexpressed in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. In LNCaP, ADT or ENZ increased CACNA1D time-dependently whereas total protein showed little change. Untreated LNCaP were unresponsive to depolarising high K+/Bay K (to activate CaV1.3); moreover, currents were rarely detected. ADT or ENZ-treated LNCaP exhibited nifedipine-sensitive Ca2+-transients; ADT-treated LNCaP exhibited mibefradil-sensitive or, occasionally, nifedipine-sensitive inward currents. CACNA1D knockdown reduced the subpopulation of treated-LNCaP with CaV1.3 activity. VCaP displayed nifedipine-sensitive high K+/Bay K transients (responding subpopulation was increased by ENZ), and Ni2+-sensitive currents. Hormone therapy enables depolarization/Bay K-evoked Ca2+-transients and detection of CaV1.3 and CaV3.2 currents.

To uncover the mechanism of HOXB3 driving tumor progression, we performed RNA-sequencing in HOXB3 negative (HOXB3-) and HOXB3 high (HOXB3 + ) staining CRPC tumors and determined that HOXB3 activation was associated with the expression of WNT3A and enriched WNT pathway genes. Furthermore, extra WNT3A and APC deficiency led HOXB3 to be isolated from destruction-complex, translocated to nuclei, and then transcriptionally regulated multiple WNT pathway genes. What's more, we also observed that the suppression of HOXB3 could reduce cell proliferation in APC-downregulated CRPC cells and sensitize APC-deficient CRPC xenografts to abiraterone again.

In the correlation analysis, the correlation between the scores of radical specimens and the global scores was highest (R=0.730, P<0.01), while the correlations of the scores based on radical specimens with highest scores and scores of the largest volume based on biopsy were insignificant (R=0.719, P<0.01; R=0.631, P<0.01, respectively). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed tPSA group and the three integrated scores of prostate biopsy were statistically correlated with extraglandular invasion, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion and biochemical recurrence. Elevated global score was an independent prognostic risk factor for extraglandular invasion and biochemical recurrence in patients; increased serum tPSA was an independent prognostic risk factor for extraglandular invasion; increased hjighest score was an independent risk factor for perineural invasion. Conclusions: In this study, among the three different integrated scores, the overall score is most likely corresponded to the radical specimen grade group, but there is difference in various subgroup analyses. Integrated score of prostate biopsy can reflect grade group of radical prostatectomy specimens, thereby providing more clinical information for assisting in optimal patient management and consultation.""","""['Y Fu', 'J Cai', 'Y Chen', 'Q Zhou', 'Y M Xu', 'J Shi', 'X S Fan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Zhonghua Bing Li Xue Za Zhi""","""['Microfocal prostate cancer: a clinicopathological analysis of 206 cases.', 'Risk model based on MRI fusion biopsy characteristics predicts biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Clinical significance and risk factors of International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade upgrading in prostate cancer patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.', 'Perineural invasion status, Gleason score and number of positive cores in biopsy pathology are predictors of positive surgical margin following laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate cancer reporting: needle biopsy and radical prostatectomy specimen.']"""

A transgender individual is someone whose gender identity differs from their birth sex or the societal norms of that assigned sex. There are no formal guidelines regarding PSA screening in transgender women, even though they retain prostatic tissue throughout the gender-affirming process, and there is a lack of existing data to adequately inform clinical practice.  Methods:   We identified a cohort of transgender women in the IBM MarketScan dataset using ICD codes. The patient...s eligibility for inclusion was determined on an annual basis for the years 2013-2019. For each year, we required continuous enrollment, 3 months of post-transgender diagnosis follow-up, and aged 40-80 without a prior diagnosis of prostate malignancy. This cohort was compared to cisgender men with similar eligibility criteria. The proportions of individuals undergoing PSA screening were compared using log-binomial regression.  Results:   A group of 2957 transgender women met the inclusion criteria. We saw significantly lower PSA screening rates among transgender individuals for ages 40-54 and 55-69, but higher rates within the age group 70-80 (P.ß<.ß.001 for all).  Conclusion:   This is the first study evaluating PSA screening rates for insured transgender women. While the rates for screening in transgender women over the age of 70 are higher, the overall rate of screening for all other age groups lags below the general population in this dataset. Further investigation is necessary to provide equitable care for the transgender community.""","""['Hayley Premo', 'Alexander Gordee', 'Hui-Jie Lee', 'Charles D Scales', 'Judd W Moul', 'Andrew Peterson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urology""","""['Investigating sex differences in T regulatory cells from cisgender and transgender healthy individuals and patients with autoimmune inflammatory disease: a cross-sectional study.', 'Prostate cancer in transgender women: what does a urologist need to know?', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Transgender Patients.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Primary Care Initiated Gender-Affirming Therapy for Gender Dysphoria: A Review of Evidence Based Guidelines Internet.']"""

Patients and methods:   To ascertain the role of frequent somatic genomic alterations and histology subtypes in the outcomes of gBRCA2 mutation carriers and non-carriers, we correlated the tumour characteristics and clinical outcomes of 73 gBRCA2 and 127 non-carriers. Fluorescent in-situ hybridisation and next-generation sequencing were used to detect copy number variations in BRCA2, RB1, MYC and PTEN. Presence of intraductal and cribriform subtypes was also assessed. The independent impact of these events on cause-specific survival (CSS), metastasis-free survival and time to castration-resistant disease was assessed using cox-regression models.  Results:   Somatic BRCA2-RB1 co-deletion (41% versus 12%, p < 0.001) and MYC amplification (53.4% versus 18.8%, p < 0.001) were enriched in gBRCA2 compared to sporadic tumours. Median CSS from diagnosis of PCa was 9.1 versus 17.6 years in gBRCA2 carriers and non-carriers, respectively (HR 2.12; p = 0.002), Median CSS in gBRCA2 carriers increased to 11.3 and 13.4 years in the absence of BRCA2-RB1 deletion or MYC amplification, respectively. Median CSS of non-carriers decreased to 8 and 2.6 years if BRCA2-RB1 deletion or MYC amplification were detected.

In the present research, sarcosine oxidase (SOX) specifically catalyzes the oxidation of Sar to yield H2O2 which can rapidly oxidize Ce(III)-CPNs to generate Ce(IV)-CPNs in appropriate alkaline solution. The generated Ce(IV)-CPNs create a markedly weakened fluorescent signal at 350 nm, while they can induce oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) to generate blue TMBox through emerging good oxidase-like activity. The sensing platform can realize accurate, stable, and high-throughput detection of Sar because of the tandem dual signal output mechanism.

Contextually, obesity, and its comorbidities, is the largest, most lethal pandemics in the history of mankind; hence, identification of underlying mechanisms is needed to adequately address this global health threat. Herein, we present the metabolic and hormonal mechanisms linked to obesity that might etiologically contribute to neoplasia, including hyperinsulinemia and putative places in the insulin-signaling pathway. Excess insulin, acting as a growth factor, might contribute to tumorigenesis, while abundant ATP and GDP supply the additional energy needed for proliferation of rapidly dividing cells. Our observations in the Ecuadorian cohort of subjects with Laron syndrome (ELS) prove that obesity does not always associate with increased cancer risk. Indeed, despite excess body fat from birth to death, these individuals display a diminished incidence of cancer when compared to their age- and sex-matched relatives. Furthermore, in cell cultures exposed to potent oxidizing agents, addition of ELS serum induces less DNA damage as well as increased apoptosis. ELS individuals have absent growth hormone (GH) counter-regulatory effects in carbohydrate metabolism due to a defective GH receptor. The corresponding biochemical phenotype includes extremely low basal serum concentrations of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I, lower basal glucose and triglyceride (TG) levels, and diminished glucose, TG, and insulin responses to orally administered glucose or to a mixed meal.""","""['Jaime Guevara-Aguirre', 'Gabriela Peña', 'Gabriel Pazmiño', 'William Acosta', 'Jannette Saavedra', 'Daniela Lescano', 'Alexandra Guevara', 'Antonio W D Gavilanes']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Endocr Relat Cancer""","""['Despite higher body fat content, Ecuadorian subjects with Laron syndrome have less insulin resistance and lower incidence of diabetes than their relatives.', 'Insights from the clinical phenotype of subjects with Laron syndrome in Ecuador.', 'Obesity, diabetes and cancer: insight into the relationship from a cohort with growth hormone receptor deficiency.', 'GH Receptor Deficiency in Ecuadorian Adults Is Associated With Obesity and Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity.', 'Growth hormone receptor deficiency in humans associates to obesity, increased body fat percentage, a healthy brain and a coordinated insulin sensitivity.']"""

Conclusions:   Site-specific PRSs can stratify the risk of developing breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers in this East Asian population.

African American (AA) men are at greater risk for developing prostate cancer, and experience higher mortality rates, as compared with Caucasian American men. However, mechanistic studies to understand this health disparity have been limited by the lack of relevant in vitro and in vivo models. There is an urgent need for preclinical cellular models to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying prostate cancer in AA men. We collected clinical specimens from radical prostatectomies of AA patients and established 10 paired tumor-derived and normal epithelial cell cultures from the same donors, which were further cultivated to extend the growth under ""conditional reprogramming."" Clinical and cellular annotations characterized these model cells as intermediate risk and predominantly diploid. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated variable expression levels of luminal (CK8) and basal (CK5, p63) markers in both normal and tumor cells. However, expression levels of TOPK, c-MYC, and N-MYC were markedly increased only in tumor cells. To determine cell utility for drug testing, we examined viability of cells following exposure to the antiandrogen (bicalutamide) and two PARP inhibitors (olaparib and niraparib) and observed decreased viability of tumor-derived cells as compared with viability of normal prostate-derived cells.  Significance:   Cells derived from prostatectomies of AA patients conferred a bimodal cellular phenotype, recapitulating clinical prostate cellular complexity in this model cell system. Comparisons of viability responses of tumor derived to normal epithelial cells offer the potential for screening therapeutic drugs. Therefore, these paired prostate epithelial cell cultures provide an in vitro model system suitable for studies of molecular mechanisms in health disparities.""","""['Mira Jung', 'Keith Kowalczyk', 'Ryan Hankins', 'Gaurav Bandi', 'Bhaskar Kallakury', 'Michael A Carrasquilla', 'Partha P Banerjee', 'Scott Grindrod', 'Anatoly Dritschilo']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""['African-American Prostate Normal and Cancer Cells for Health Disparities Research.', 'Cytochrome c Deficiency Confers Apoptosome and Mitochondrial Dysfunction in African-American Men with Prostate Cancer.', 'Conditionally reprogrammed normal and primary tumor prostate epithelial cells: a novel patient-derived cell model for studies of human prostate cancer.', 'Genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic signatures of prostate cancer between African American and European American patients.', 'Racial disparity in prostate cancer in the African American population with actionable ideas and novel immunotherapies.']"""

In the case of ovarian and prostate cancers, their classification as homologous recombination repair (HRR) deficient (HRD) or mutated also makes PARPi an available treatment option beyond BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutational status. However, identification of the most relevant genetic alterations driving the HRD phenotype has proven difficult and recent data have shown that other genetic alterations not affecting HRR are also capable of driving PARPi responses. To gain insight into the genetics driving PARPi sensitivity, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 loss-of-function screens in six PARPi-insensitive cell lines and combined the output with published PARPi datasets from eight additional cell lines. Ensuing exploration of the data identified 110 genes whose inactivation is strongly linked to sensitivity to PARPi. Parallel cell line generation of isogenic gene knockouts in ovarian and prostate cancer cell lines identified that inactivation of core HRR factors is required for driving in vitro PARPi responses comparable with the ones observed for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Moreover, pan-cancer genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic data analyses of these 110 genes highlight the ones most frequently inactivated in tumors, making this study a valuable resource for prospective identification of potential PARPi-responsive patient populations. Importantly, our investigations uncover XRCC3 gene silencing as a potential new prognostic biomarker of PARPi sensitivity in prostate cancer.  Significance:   This study identifies tumor genetic backgrounds where to expand the use of PARPis beyond mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. This is achieved by combining the output of unbiased genome-wide loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 genetic screens with bioinformatics analysis of biallelic losses of the identified genes in public tumor datasets, unveiling loss of the DNA repair gene XRCC3 as a potential biomarker of PARPi sensitivity in prostate cancer.""","""['Kunzah Jamal#', 'Alessandro Galbiati#', 'Joshua Armenia#', 'Giuditta Illuzzi', 'James Hall', 'Sabrina Bentouati', 'Daniel Barrell', ""Miika Ahdesmäki;Functional Genomics Centre Group;Mark J O'Connor"", 'Elisabetta Leo', 'Josep V Forment']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""['RAD51 foci as a functional biomarker of homologous recombination repair and PARP inhibitor resistance in germline BRCA-mutated breast cancer.', 'Preclinical In Vivo Validation of the RAD51 Test for Identification of Homologous Recombination-Deficient Tumors and Patient Stratification.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Olaparib Use in Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Harboring Somatic BRCA1/2 Mutations or Mutations in Non-BRCA1/2, DNA Damage Repair Genes.', 'Homologous Recombination Defects and Mutations in DNA Damage Response (DDR) Genes Besides BRCA1 and BRCA2 as Breast Cancer Biomarkers for PARP Inhibitors and Other DDR Targeting Therapies.', 'RAD51C-XRCC3 structure and cancer patient mutations define DNA replication roles.', 'Impact of DNA damage repair alterations on prostate cancer progression and metastasis.', 'Homologous recombination deficiency derived from whole-genome sequencing predicts platinum response in triple-negative breast cancers.']"""

C-to-U RNA editing sites (RES) are relatively rare and understudied in humans, compared to A-to-I editing. However, the functional impact of C-to-U editing in human cancers also remains elusive. Here, we conducted the first comprehensive survey of pan-cancer C-to-U RESs. Surprisingly, we found that the same subset of RESs were associated with multiple features, including patient survival, cancer stemness, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and tumor-infiltrated immune cell compositions (ICC), suggesting an RES-mediated close relationship between these features. For example, editing sites for GALM or IFI6 that led to higher expression were linked to lower survival and more cancer stemness. Also, TMB was found to be lower in prostate cancer cases with ICC-associated RESs in CAVIN1 or VWA8 or higher in prostate cancer cases with thymoma. With experimental support, we also found RESs in CST3, TPI1, or TNC that are linked to immune checkpoint blockade by anti-PD1. We also confirmed through experiments that two C-to-U RESs in CSNK2B or RPS14 had different effects on colon cancer cells. Patients with CSNK2B editing, which increased the expression of the oncogene CLDN18, had a lower response to drugs. On the other hand, drugs worked better on people who had RPS14 editing, which greatly increased ribosome production. In summary, our study demonstrated the important roles of C-to-U RESs across cancers and shed light on personalized cancer therapy.""","""['Mengbiao Guo', 'Feng Li', 'Linghao Zhao', 'Zhengwen Fang', 'Huichuan Yu', 'Zhou Songyang', 'Yuanyan Xiong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Genome-wide investigation and functional analysis of RNA editing sites in wheat.', 'Decoding RNA Editing Sites Through Transcriptome Analysis in Rice Under Alkaline Stress.', 'Identifies microtubule-binding protein CSPP1 as a novel cancer biomarker associated with ferroptosis and tumor microenvironment.', 'Systemic treatments for metastatic cutaneous melanoma.', 'RNA Editing in Pathogenesis of Cancer.']"""

However, the effect of ERS on the biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer patients remains elusive. Here, we generated an ERS-related genes risk signature to evaluate the physiological function of ERS in PCa with BCR.  Methods:   We collected the ERS-related genes from the GeneCards. The edgeR package was used to screen the differential ERS-related genes in PCa from TCGA datasets. ERS-related gene risk signature was then established using LASSO and multivariate Cox regression models and validated by GEO data sets. Nomogram was developed to assess BCR-free survival possibility. Meanwhile, the correlations between ERS-related signature, gene mutations, drug sensitivity and tumor microenvironment were also investigated.  Results:   We obtained an ERS risk signature consisting of five genes (AFP, COL10A1, DNAJB1, EGF and PTGS2). Kaplan Meier survival analysis and ROC Curve analysis indicated that the high risk score of ERS-related gene signature was associated with poor BCR-free prognosis in PCa patients. Besides, immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint expression levels differed between high- and low-risk scoring subgroups. Moreover, drug sensitivity analyzed indicated that high-risk score group may be involved in apoptosis pathway.  Discussion:   This study comprehensively analyzed the characteristics of ERS related genes in PCa, and created a five-gene signature, which could effectively predict the BCR time of PCa patients. Targeting ERS related genes and pathways may provide potential guidance for the treatment of PCa.""","""['Shengren Cen', 'Dongmei Jiang', 'Daojun Lv', 'Ran Xu', 'Jiamao Hou', 'Zixiang Yang', 'Peng Wu', 'Xinhao Xiong', 'Xingcheng Gao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)""","""['Identification of an endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signature associated with clinical prognosis and immune therapy in glioma.', 'Construction of an endoplasmic reticulum stress-related signature in lung adenocarcinoma by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis.', 'Roles of m5C RNA Modification Patterns in Biochemical Recurrence and Tumor Microenvironment Characterization of Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive characterization of endoplasmic reticulum stress in bladder cancer revealing the association with tumor immune microenvironment and prognosis.', 'Development and validation of novel inflammatory response-related gene signature to predict prostate cancer recurrence and response to immune checkpoint therapy.']"""

In view of their proinflammatory potential and their interactions with the gut microbiota, their contribution to the etiology of other chronic diseases such as cancer has been postulated. However, to our knowledge, no epidemiologic study has investigated this hypothesis so far.  Objectives:   Our objective was to investigate the associations between FODMAP intake (total and by type) and cancer risk (overall, breast, prostate, and colorectal) in a large prospective cohort.  Methods:   The study was based on the NutriNet-Santé cohort (2009-2020); 104,909 adult participants without cancer at baseline were included in our analyses (median follow-up time = 7.7 y, 78.7% women, mean ± SD age at baseline 42.1 ± 14.5 y). Baseline dietary intakes were obtained from repeated 24-h dietary records linked to a detailed food composition table. Associations between FODMAP intake (expressed in quintiles, Q) and cancer risks were assessed by Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for a large range of lifestyle, sociodemographic, and anthropometric variables.  Results:   Total FODMAP intake was associated with increased overall cancer risk (n = 3374 incident cases, HR for sex-specific Q5 compared with Q1: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.44; P-trend = 0.04). In particular, oligosaccharides were associated with cancer risk: a trend was observed for overall cancer (HR Q5 compared with Q1: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.97, 1.25; P-trend = 0.04) and colorectal cancer (n = 272, HR Q5 compared with Q1: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.13-2.79; P-trend = 0.02).

T1 mapping was performed before and after administration of gadolinium-based contrast-agent (GBCA) using (i) a modified Look-Locker inversion (MOLLI) technique and (ii) a novel single-shot T1FLASH inversion recovery technique. T2wi, DWI, T1FLASH and MOLLI sequences were systematically examined regarding prevalence of artifacts and image quality using a 5-point Likert-Scale.  Results:   A total of n = 100 patients were included (median age: 68 years). T1FLASH maps (pre-and post-GBCA) showed metal artifacts in 7% of cases and susceptibility artifacts in 1%. For MOLLI maps, pre-GBCA metal and susceptibility artifacts were documented in 6.5% of cases each. MOLLI maps post-GBCA showed artifacts in 59% of cases resulting primarily from urinary GBCA excretion and GBCA accumulation at the bladder base (p < 0.01 versus T1FLASH post-GBCA). Image quality for T1FLASH pre-GBCA was rated at a mean 4.9+/-0.4 and for MOLLI at 4.8+/-0.6 (p = 0.14). Post-GBCA image quality was rated at a mean 4.9+/-0.4 for T1FLASH and at 3.7+/-1.1 for MOLLI (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   T1FLASH maps provide a fast and robust method for quantification of T1 relaxation times of the prostate.

Their expression has been validated using several unbiased techniques, including Nanopore sequencing. Most of these transcripts originate from an in-frame exon skipping and, thus, are expected to be translated into ETV4 protein isoforms. Functional analysis of the most abundant among these isoforms shows that they still bear an activity, namely a reduced ability to promote proliferation and a residual ability to regulate the transcription of ETV4 target genes. Alternatively spliced genes are common in cancer cells: an analysis of the TCGA dataset confirms the abundance of these novel ETV4 transcripts in prostate tumors, in contrast to peritumoral tissues. Since none of their translated isoforms have acquired a higher oncogenic potential, such abundance is likely to reflect the tumor deranged splicing machinery. However, it is also possible that their interaction with the canonical variants may contribute to the biology and the clinics of prostate cancer.

RAW264.7 cells were cocultured with PC-3 or DU-145 cells in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This coculturing blocked the proliferation and accelerated the death of cancer cells. Interestingly, cancer cell proliferation was repressed and death was promoted by the addition of the conditioned medium obtained from RAW264.7 cells treated with LPS. Culturing with LPS mostly augmented the production of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the culture medium of RAW264.7 cells. The effects of the conditioned medium on the proliferation and death of PC-3 or DU-145 cells were blocked by NF-κB or STAT3 signaling inhibitors.

We intended to investigate the function of CAFs autophagy in prostate cancer (PCa). Firstly, CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated from cancerous and adjacent normal tissues of PCa patients, for the following experimental preparation. In comparison with NFs, CAFs expressed higher levels of the myofibroblast marker ?-smooth muscle actin (?-SMA) and the mesenchymal marker Vimentin. Besides, CAFs possessed a higher autophagic level than NFs. As for malignant phenotypes, PCa cells co-cultured with CAFs-CM showed greater proliferation, migration and invasion capabilities, while these outcomes were obviously abolished by autophagy inhibition with 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). Moreover, silencing of ATG5 in CAFs inhibited fibroblasts autophagic level and suppressed malignant phenotypes of PCa cells, while ATG5 overexpression in NFs exerted opposite effects. Depletion of ATG5 in CAFs inhibited the xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis of PCa cells. Taken together, our data demonstrated the promotive effect of CAFs on PCa malignant phenotypes through ATG5-dependent autophagy, suggesting a novel mechanism for PCa progression.""","""['XuKai Liu', 'JiZu Tang', 'LiQiang Peng', 'HaiBo Nie', 'YuanGuang Zhang', 'Pan Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Apoptosis""","""['Autophagic secretion of HMGB1 from cancer-associated fibroblasts promotes metastatic potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells via NFκB signaling.', 'Immortalized Cancer-associated Fibroblasts Promote Prostate Cancer Carcinogenesis, Proliferation and Invasion.', 'Loss of exosomal miR-146a-5p from cancer-associated fibroblasts after androgen deprivation therapy contributes to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts Autophagy Enhances Progression of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells.', 'TGF-β1-activated cancer-associated fibroblasts promote breast cancer invasion, metastasis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition by autophagy or overexpression of FAP-α.']"""

Besides its ability to generate insoluble toxic oligomers, Tau homeostasis has attracted attention for its involvement in the formation of the mitotic spindle. This evidence, in association with the description of Tau expression in extra-neuronal tissues, and mainly in cancer tissues, constitutes the rationale for a more in-depth investigation of Tau role also in neoplastic diseases.  Methods:   In our study, we investigated the expression of phosphorylated Tau in prostate cancer cell lines with particular focus on the residue Thr231 present in microtubule binding domain.  Results:   The analysis of prostate cancer cells synchronized with nocodazole demonstrated that the expression of Tau protein phosphorylated at residue Thr231 is restricted to G2/M cell cycle phase. The phosphorylated form was unable to bind tubulin and it does not localize on mitotic spindle. As demonstrated by the use of specific inhibitors, the phosphorylation status of Tau is under the direct control of cdk5 and PP2A, while cdk1 activation was able to exert an indirect control. These mechanisms were also active in cells treated with docetaxel, where counteracting the expression of the dephosphorylated form, by kinase inhibition or protein silencing, determined resistance to drug toxicity.

However, the role of XPO7 in PCa remains elusive.  Methods:   Here, in this study, immunohistochemistry and bioinformatics were used to determine the expression pattern and prognostic significance of XPO7. To investigate the functions of XPO7 in vitro and in vivo, we knocked down XPO7 in PCa cell lines and established xenograft mice models. Then, we used multiple experiments to determine the cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle and EMT in PCa cells after XPO7 modulation. Mechanistically, we conducted RNA-seq and identified the regulating effect of XPO7 on cell cycle-related and PI3K-AKT pathways. Furthermore, we assessed the regulating correlation between XPO7 and TCF3 and verified by a series of rescue experiments.  Results:   We found a higher XPO7 expression in prostate cancer tissues and predicted a poorer prognosis of prostate cancer. Then, we further revealed that the ectopic expression of XPO7 in PCa cells facilitated cells proliferation, migration, cell cycle progression and EMT in vitro and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we conducted RNA-seq and identified the regulating effect of XPO7 on cell cycle-related and PI3K-AKT pathways. Furthermore, a significantly positive correlation was discovered between the expression of XPO7 and TCF3. In addition, XPO7 may regulate PCa through mediating TCF3 expression.

A DNA sequence modified with methylene blue (MB) was covalently bound to the electrochemical strip and used to detect the selected target miRNA-21. After optimization of selected parameters in standard solutions, including the study of the effect of pH, the presence of interferent species, and NaCl salt concentration in the background, the application of square-wave voltammetry (SWV) technique allowed the detection of miRNA-21 down to a limit in the order of 2 nM.

We examined the association between cancer history and neurocognitive test performance among middle-aged and older Hispanic/Latinos.  Methods:   Participants included 9639 Hispanic/Latino adults from the community-based and prospective Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. At baseline (2008-2011; V1), participants self-reported their cancer history. At V1 and again at a 7-year follow-up (2015-2018; V2), trained technicians administered neurocognitive tests including the Brief-Spanish English Verbal Learning Test (B-SEVLT), Word Fluency Test (WF), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSS). We used survey linear regression to estimate the overall, sex-specific, and cancer site-specific [i.e., cervix, breast, uterus, and prostate] adjusted associations between cancer history and neurocognitive test performance at V1 and changes from V1 to V2.  Results:   At V1, a history of cancer (6.4%) versus no history of cancer (93.6%) was associated with higher WF scores (β = 0.14, SE = 0.06; p = 0.03) and global cognition (β = 0.09, SE = 0.04; p = 0.04).

The radiosensitive of cell lines was determined by cell clonogenic assay and cell cycle analysis. The cytotoxic effect was evaluated with MTT and CVS (Crystal violet staining) assay, apoptosis detection and cell cycle analysis. The phenotype of the cells was determined by glucose uptake and lactate release, ATP level measurement as well as basal reactive oxygen species level and mRNA expression of genes related to oxidative stress defence.  Results:   The synergistic effect of 2,4-dinitrophenol and X-ray was observed only in the case of the LNCaP cell line.

Methods and results:   The number of metastases in the major body systems and the proportion of participants with metastases were documented in 50 participants (19 germline mutation carriers). Analysis was conducted on the participants' pattern of disease for the different cancers and mutation subgroups. The four commonly affected organ systems were the digestive (liver only) (82%), respiratory (76%), gastrointestinal (65%) and reticuloendothelial (42%). There were significant differences in the pattern of metastatic breast cancer in BRCA1/2 germline carriers compared with non-carriers. Breast cancer carriers had significantly fewer organ systems involved (median n = 3, range = 1-3) compared with non-carriers (median n = 9, range = 1-7) (P = 0.03). BRCA1/2 carriers with ovarian carcinomas had significantly more organ systems with metastatic carcinoma (median n = 10, range = 3-8) than non-carriers (median n = 5, range = 3-5) (P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the number of involved systems in BRCA2 carriers compared with non-carriers with prostate cancer (P = 1.0). There was an absence of locoregional disease (6.5%) compared with distant disease (93.5%) among the three cancer subtypes (P < 0.001). The majority of metastatic deposits (97%) collected during the autopsy were identified by recent diagnostic imaging.  Conclusion:   Even though a major limitation of this study is that our numbers are small, especially in the breast cancer carrier group, the metastatic patterns of breast and ovarian cancers may be impacted by BRCA1/2 carrier status, suggesting that tumours derived from patients with these mutations use different mechanisms of dissemination.

Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is considered to play a crucial role in the development of the metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, which causes the majority of the death cases in PC. Golgi membrane protein 1 (GOLM1) is highly expressed in PC and has been identified as a driver factor for EMT in various cancers. However, its biological functions and underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous in PC. Method: GOLM1 expression level of PC was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. To investigate GOLM1 functions in cancer cells, we overexpressed and knocked down GOLM1 in different prostate cancer cell lines. Transwell assay and wound healing assay were used to determine the role of GOLM1 in cell EMT, such as migration and invasion abilities. TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling pathway downstream of GOLM1 was detected by Western blot and Transwell assay. Result: GOLM1 expression is up-regulated in PC and correlated with a worse prognosis. GOLM1 promotes the abilities of migration and invasion in PC cell lines (DU145 and LNCaP). Furthermore, TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling is positively regulated by GOLM1 to facilitate EMT in PC, whereas this role can be restored by TGF-β1 after GOLM1 knockdown or be abrogated by p-Smad inhibitor SB431542. Conclusion: GOLM1 is significantly upregulated in PC and acts as a critical oncogene by promoting PC cell EMT process by activating TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling pathway. Therefore, GOLM1 has the potential to be a biomarker for PC diagnosis and to predict the prognosis of PC patients. It is of great significance to seek effective and specific inhibitor of GOLM1 for PC treatment as well.""","""['Xuke Qin', 'Lin Liu', 'Yanze Li', 'Hongbo Luo', 'Hui Chen', 'Xiaodong Weng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Technol Cancer Res Treat""","""['GP73 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion partly by activating TGF-β1/Smad2 signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'GP73 promotes invasion and metastasis of bladder cancer by regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through the TGF-β1/Smad2 signalling pathway.', 'Transcription factor specificity protein 1-mediated Serine/threonine kinase 39 upregulation promotes the proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by activating the transforming growth factor-β1 /Smad2/3 pathway.', 'Upregulation of long non-coding RNA PlncRNA-1 promotes proliferation and induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'GOLM1 promotes prostate cancer progression through activating PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling.']"""

Pre-clinical studies have shown that vaccination with Bcl-XL-derived peptides can induce tumor-specific T cell responses that may lead to the elimination of cancer cells. Furthermore, pre-clinical studies of the novel adjuvant CAF®09b have shown that intraperitoneal (IP) injections of this adjuvant can improve the activation of the immune system. In this study, patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (PC) received a vaccine consisting of Bcl-XL-peptide with CAF®09b as an adjuvant. The primary aim was to evaluate the tolerability and safety of IP and intramuscular (IM) administration, determine the optimal route of administration, and characterize vaccine immunogenicity.  Patients and methods:   Twenty patients were included. A total of six vaccinations were scheduled: in Group A (IM to IP injections), ten patients received three vaccines IM biweekly; after a three-week pause, patients then received three vaccines IP biweekly. In Group B (IP to IM injections), ten patients received IP vaccines first, followed by IM under a similar vaccination schedule. Safety was assessed by logging and evaluating adverse events (AE) according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.0). Vaccines-induced immune responses were analyzed by Enzyme-Linked Immunospot and flow cytometry.  Results:   No serious AEs were reported. Although an increase in T cell response against the Bcl-XL-peptide was found in all patients, a larger proportion of patients in group B demonstrated earlier and stronger immune responses to the vaccine compared to patients in group A. Further, we demonstrated vaccine-induced immunity towards patient-specific CD4, and CD8 T cell epitopes embedded in Bcl-XL-peptide and an increase in CD4 and CD8 T cell activation markers CD107a and CD137 following vaccination. At a median follow-up of 21 months, no patients had experienced clinically significant disease progression.

From October to December 2020, male residents ≥50 years of age were screened for serum total prostate-specific antigen (total-PSA). If t-PSA re-test levels persisted above 4 μg/L, subjects underwent further noninvasive examinations, including digital rectal examination or multiparameter magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate. Subjects underwent prostate biopsy of pathological tissue based on t-PSA and mpMRI results. A total of 3524 (49.1%) residents participated in this PCa screening study. In total, 285 (8.1%) subjects exhibited t-PSA levels ≥4.0 μg/L and 112 (3.2%) underwent noninvasive examinations. Forty-two (1.2%) residents underwent prostate biopsy, of which 16 (0.45%) were diagnosed with PCa. Of those diagnosed with PCa, three (19%) had localized PCa (cT1-cT2N0M0), six (37%) had locally advanced PCa (cT3a- cT4N0-1M0), and seven (44%) had advanced metastatic PCa (M1). Unfortunately, 3477 (48.5%) residents did not participate in the study, mainly due to lack of awareness of PCa based on feedback from local health centers. Age and t-PSA were used as primary screening indicators and, when further combined with mpMRI and prostate biopsy, confirmed the diagnosis of PCa among participating residents.

During a median follow-up of 10.9 and 10.7 years, 53,049 (11.7%) and 4,362 (11.8%) incident cancers were documented in UKB and SALT, respectively. Using multivariable-adjusted Cox models, we found a higher risk of any cancer in frail vs. non-frail UKB participants, when defined by both FI (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.17-1.28) and FP (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.11-1.21). The FI in SALT similarly predicted risk of any cancer (HR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.15-1.49). Moreover, frailty was predictive of lung cancer in UKB, although this association was not observed in SALT. Adding frailty scores to models including age, sex, and traditional cancer risk factors resulted in little improvement in C-statistics for most cancers. In a within-twin-pair analysis in SALT, the association between FI and any cancer was attenuated within monozygotic but not dizygotic twins, indicating that it may partly be explained by genetic factors. Our findings suggest that frailty scores are associated with the incidence of any cancer and lung cancer, although their clinical utility for predicting cancers may be limited.""","""['Jonathan K L Mak', 'Ralf Kuja-Halkola', 'Yunzhang Wang', 'Sara Hägg', 'Juulia Jylhävä']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Geroscience""","""['Association of frailty with the incidence risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus in long-term cancer survivors: a prospective cohort study.', 'Frailty and the risk of dementia: is the association explained by shared environmental and genetic factors?', 'Neuroticism as a Predictor of Frailty in Old Age: A Genetically Informative Approach.', 'The ability of three different models of frailty to predict all-cause mortality: results from the European Male Aging Study (EMAS).', 'A simple test-based frailty index to predict survival among cancer patients with an unplanned hospitalization: An observational cohort study.']"""

Through combining the H3K27ac, AR and CTCF HiChIP profiles with CRISPR deletion of a CTCF site upstream of MYC gene, we show that MYC activation leads to profound changes of CTCF-mediated chromatin looping. Mechanistically, MYC colocalizes with CTCF at a subset of genomic sites, and enhances CTCF occupancy at these loci. Consequently, the CTCF-mediated chromatin looping is potentiated by MYC activation, resulting in the disruption of enhancer-promoter looping at neuroendocrine lineage plasticity genes.

We hypothesized that using the salivary glands as a reference organ can enable selective patient stratification. We aimed to establish a PSMA PET tumor-to-salivary gland ratio (PSG score) to predict outcomes after [177Lu]PSMA. Methods: In total, 237 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with [177Lu]PSMA were included. A quantitative PSG (qPSG) score (SUVmean ratio of whole-body tumor to parotid glands) was semiautomatically calculated on baseline [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET images. Patients were divided into 3 groups: high (qPSG > 1.5), intermediate (qPSG = 0.5-1.5), and low (qPSG < 0.5) scores. Ten readers interpreted the 3-dimensional maximum-intensity-projection baseline [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET images and classified patients into 3 groups based on visual PSG (vPSG) score: high (most of the lesions showed higher uptake than the parotid glands) intermediate (neither low nor high), and low (most of the lesions showed lower uptake than the parotid glands). Outcome data included a more than 50% prostate-specific antigen decline, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Results: Of the 237 patients, the numbers in the high, intermediate, and low groups were 56 (23.6%), 163 (68.8%), and 18 (7.6%), respectively, for qPSG score and 106 (44.7%), 96 (40.5%), and 35 (14.8%), respectively, for vPSG score. The interreader reproducibility of the vPSG score was substantial (Fleiss weighted κ, 0.68). The more than 50% prostate-specific antigen decline was better in patients with a higher PSG score (high vs. intermediate vs. low, 69.6% vs. 38.7% vs. 16.7%, respectively, for qPSG [P < 0.001] and 63.2% vs 33.3% vs 16.1%, respectively, for vPSG [P < 0.001]). The median PSA progression-free survival of the high, intermediate, and low groups by qPSG score was 7.2, 4.0, and 1.9 mo (P < 0.001), respectively, by qPSG score and 6.7, 3.8, and 1.9 mo (P < 0.001), respectively, by vPSG score. The median OS of the high, intermediate, and low groups was 15.0, 11.2, and 13.9 mo (P = 0.017), respectively, by qPSG score and 14.3, 9.6, and 12.9 mo (P = 0.018), respectively, by vPSG score.

The mechanism of action of one drug may counteract the resistance pathways of the other. We sought to determine whether the addition of abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AAP) to enzalutamide prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the first-line setting.  Patients and methods:   Men with untreated mCRPC were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive first-line enzalutamide with or without AAP. The primary end point was OS. Toxicity, prostate-specific antigen declines, pharmacokinetics, and radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) were also examined. Data were analyzed using an intent-to-treat approach. The Kaplan-Meier estimate and the stratified log-rank statistic were used to compare OS between treatments.  Results:   In total, 1,311 patients were randomly assigned: 657 to enzalutamide and 654 to enzalutamide plus AAP. OS was not statistically different between the two arms (median, 32.7 [95% CI, 30.5 to 35.4] months for enzalutamide v 34.2 [95% CI, 31.4 to 37.3] months for enzalutamide and AAP; hazard ratio [HR], 0.89; one-sided P = .03; boundary nominal significance level = .02). rPFS was longer in the combination arm (median rPFS, 21.3 [95% CI, 19.4 to 22.9] months for enzalutamide v 24.3 [95% CI, 22.3 to 26.7] months for enzalutamide and AAP; HR, 0.86; two-sided P = .02). However, pharmacokinetic clearance of abiraterone was 2.2- to 2.9-fold higher when administered with enzalutamide, compared with clearance values for abiraterone alone.  Conclusion:   The addition of AAP to enzalutamide for first-line treatment of mCRPC was not associated with a statistically significant benefit in OS.

Early identification of resistance will improve management strategies. We investigated whether changes in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) fraction during ARPI treatment are linked with mCRPC clinical outcomes.  Experimental design:   Plasma cell-free DNA was collected from 81 patients with mCRPC at baseline and after 4 weeks of first-line ARPI treatment during two prospective multicenter observational studies (NCT02426333; NCT02471469). ctDNA fraction was calculated from somatic mutations in targeted sequencing and genome copy-number profiles. Samples were classified into detected versus undetected ctDNA. Outcome measurements were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Nondurable treatment response was defined as PFS ≤6 months.  Results:   ctDNA was detected in 48/81 (59%) baseline and 29/81 (36%) 4-week samples. ctDNA fraction for samples with detected ctDNA was lower at 4 weeks versus baseline (median 5.0% versus 14.5%, P = 0.017). PFS and OS were shortest for patients with persistent ctDNA at 4 weeks (univariate HR, 4.79; 95% CI, 2.62-8.77 and univariate HR, 5.49; 95% CI, 2.76-10.91, respectively), independent of clinical prognostic factors. For patients exhibiting change from detected to undetected ctDNA by 4 weeks, there was no significant PFS difference versus patients with baseline undetected ctDNA. ctDNA change had a positive predictive value of 88% and negative predictive value of 92% for identifying nondurable responses.  Conclusions:   Early changes in ctDNA fraction are strongly linked to duration of first-line ARPI treatment benefit and survival in mCRPC and may inform early therapy switches or treatment intensification.

The present study investigated the genes responsible for ARPC progression and ADT resistance, and their regulatory mechanisms.  Methods:   Transcriptome analysis, co-immunoprecipitation, confocal microscopy, and FACS analysis were performed to determine differentially-expressed genes, integrin α3β4 heterodimer, and cancer stem cell (CSC) population. miRNA array, 3'-UTR reporter assay, ChIP assay, qPCR, and immunoblotting were used to determine differentially-expressed microRNAs, their binding to integrin transcripts, and gene expressions. A xenograft tumor model was used to assess tumor growth and metastasis.  Results:   Metastatic ARPC cell lines (PC-3 and DU145) exhibiting significant downregulation of ZBTB16 and AR showed significantly upregulated ITGA3 and ITGB4. Silencing either one of the integrin α3β4 heterodimer significantly suppressed ARPC survival and CSC population. miRNA array and 3'-UTR reporter assay revealed that miR-200c-3p, the most strongly downregulated miRNA in ARPCs, directly bound to 3'-UTR of ITGA3 and ITGB4 to inhibit the gene expression. Concurrently, miR-200c-3p also increased PLZF expression, which, in turn, inhibited integrin α3β4 expression. Combination treatment with miR-200c-3p mimic and AR inhibitor enzalutamide showed synergistic inhibitory effects on ARPC cell survival in vitro and tumour growth and metastasis of ARPC xenografts in vivo, and the combination effect was greater than the mimic alone.  Conclusion:   This study demonstrated that miR-200c-3p treatment of ARPC is a promising therapeutic approach to restore the sensitivity to anti-androgen therapy and inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.""","""['Sadan Dahal#', 'Prakash Chaudhary#', 'Jung-Ae Kim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Oncol (Dordr)""","""['Magnolol regulates miR-200c-3p to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition and retinoblastoma progression by modulating the ZEB1/E-cadherin axis in vitro and in vivo.', 'MicroRNA-200c-3p/ZEB2 loop plays a crucial role in the tumor progression of prostate carcinoma.', 'A novel feedback loop between high MALAT-1 and low miR-200c-3p promotes cell migration and invasion in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and is predictive of poor prognosis.', 'miR-103a-2-5p/miR-30c-1-3p inhibits the progression of prostate cancer resistance to androgen ablation therapy via targeting androgen receptor variant 7.', 'Regulation of the MIR155 host gene in physiological and pathological processes.']"""

One novel entrant into this field is micro-ultrasound (microUS), which uses a high-frequency imaging probe to achieve very high spatial resolution, and achieves prostate cancer detection rates equivalent to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). However, the ExactVu transrectal microUS probe has a unique geometry that makes it challenging to acquire controlled, repeatable three-dimensional (3D) transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) volumes. We describe the design, fabrication, and validation of a 3D acquisition system that allows for the accurate use of the ExactVu microUS device for volumetric prostate imaging.  Methods:   The design uses a motorized, computer-controlled brachytherapy stepper to rotate the ExactVu transducer about its axis. We perform geometric validation using a phantom with known dimensions and compare performance with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a commercial quality assurance anthropomorphic prostate phantom.  Results:   Our geometric validation shows accuracy of 1 mm or less in all three directions, and images of an anthropomorphic phantom qualitatively match those acquired using MRI and show good agreement quantitatively.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) presents superior performance and strongly affects therapeutic choice.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of PSMA PET, compared with conventional imaging methods, on the therapeutic approach in primary staging scenarios in patients with PCa treated at the Brazilian National Public Health System.  Methods:   Overall, 35 patients diagnosed with PCa were evaluated using PSMA after conventional staging imaging with multiparametric magnetic resonance (MMR) and/or total abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan and bone scintigraphy (BS). The PCa extension identified by PET was compared with conventional imaging; staging changes and the management impact were then determined. PET comparison with conventional imaging, staging, and decision-making changes was analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Results:   PET revealed local disease (LD) in 15 (42.9%) patients, seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) in 5 (14.3%) patients, pelvic nodal impairment (PNI) in 7 (20%) patients, pelvic and distant nodes in 3 (8.6%) patients, pelvic nodes and bone metastasis in 4 (11.4%) patients, and pelvic and distant nodes and bone metastasis in 1 (2.8%) patient. Staging changes were observed in 60% of patients, with downstaging predominance (76.2%). Volume increase was identified in 11 (31.4%) patients (only 4 related to upstaging, 36.4%). The board changed management decisions for 60% of the patients. The main limitations of this study were the sample size and its retrospective nature.

Commonly found mutations include L702H, W742C, H875Y, F877L and T878A, while the F877L mutation can convert second-generation antagonists such as enzalutamide and apalutamide into agonists. However, pruxelutamide, another second-generation AR antagonist, has no agonist activity with the F877L and F877L/T878A mutants and instead maintains its inhibitory activity against them. Here, it is shown that the quadruple mutation L702H/H875Y/F877L/T878A increases the soluble expression of AR LBD in complex with pruxelutamide in Escherichia coli. The crystal structure of the quadruple mutant in complex with the agonist dihydrotestosterone (DHT) reveals a partially open conformation of the AR LBD due to conformational changes in the loop connecting helices H11 and H12 (the H11-H12 loop) and Leu881. This partially open conformation creates a larger ligand-binding site for AR. Additional structural studies suggest that both the L702H and F877L mutations are important for conformational changes.

It is vital to explore sensitive biological markers to diagnose and treat BC patients. Recent studies have proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were involved in breast tumor progression. Nonetheless, whether lncRNA prostate cancer-associated transcript 19 (PCAT19) impacts BC development remains unknown.  Methods:   We performed various bioinformatic analyses, including machine learning models to identify critical regulatory lncRNAs affecting prognosis in BC. The in situ hybridization (ISH) assay was carried out to confirm the expression levels of lncRNA PCAT19 in tissue specimens. MTT assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay were performed to investigate PCAT19's impact on proliferation, migration, and invasion of BC cells. Mouse xenografts were used to examine the proliferation-inhibiting function of PCAT19 in vivo.  Results:   Among the prognosis-associated lncRNAs, PCAT19 predicted a favorable prognosis in BC. Patients with high expression levels of PCAT19 had a lower clinical stage and less lymph node metastasis. The PCAT19-related genes were enriched in signaling pathways involved in tumor development, indicating PCAT19 was an essential regulator of BC. Using the ISH assay, we confirmed the expression level of lncRNA PCAT19 in human BC tissues was lower than normal breast tissues. Moreover, the knockdown of PCAT19 further confirmed its inhibiting ability in BC cell proliferation. Correspondingly, overexpressing PCAT19 reduced tumor size in mouse xenografts.  Conclusions:   Our study demonstrated that lncRNA PCAT19 suppressed the development of BC.

This study aimed to assess a convolutional neural network for automatic and accurate CTV and OARs in prostate cancer, while comparing possible treatment plans based on autocontouring CTV to clinical treatment plans.  Methods:   Computer tomography (CT) scans of 217 patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated at our hospital were retrospectively collected and analyzed from January 2013 to January 2019. A deep learning-based method, CUNet, was used to delineate CTV and OARs. A training set of 195 CT scans and a test set of 28 CT scans were randomly chosen from the dataset. The mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (95HD), and subjective evaluation were used to evaluate the performance of this strategy. Predetermined evaluation criteria were used to grade treatment plans, and percentage errors for clinical doses to the planned target volume (PTV) and OARs were calculated.  Results:   The mean DSC and 95HD values of the defined CTVs were (0.84 ± 0.05) and (5.04 ± 2.15) mm, respectively. The average delineation time was < 15 s for each patient's CT scan. The overall positive rates for clinicians A and B were 53.15% versus 46.85%, and 54.05% versus 45.95%, respectively (P > .05) when CTV outlines from CUNet were blindly chosen and compared with the ground truth (GT). Furthermore, 8 test patients were randomly chosen to design the predicted plan based on the autocontouring CTVs and OARs, demonstrating acceptable agreement with the clinical plan: average absolute dose differences in mean value of D2, D50, D98, Dmax, and Dmean for PTV were within 0.74%, and average absolute volume differences in mean value of V45 and V50 for OARs were within 3.4%.

Cancer and its treatment can leave survivors with a myriad of challenges including physical changes which impact independence and quality of life. This project explored the relationship of income level with concerns and help-seeking for physical changes following treatment in older Canadian survivors of cancer.  Methods:   A Canada-wide survey of community-dwelling survivors of cancer explored their experiences with survivorship care one to three years following completion of treatment. A secondary trend analysis examined the relationship of income with older adults' level of concern and help-seeking experiences regarding physical consequences they attributed to their cancer treatment.  Results:   In total, 7,975 people aged 65 years and older who survived cancer responded to the survey, of whom 5,891 (73.9%) indicated annual household income. Prostate (31.3%), colorectal (22.7%) and breast (21.8%) cancer accounted for the majority of respondents. Of those who reported household income data, over 90% wrote about the impact of physical changes following treatment, their concerns about the changes, and whether they sought help for their concerns. The most frequently identified physical challenge was fatigue (63.7%). Older survivors with low annual household incomes of less than $CA25,000 reported the highest levels of concern about multiple physical symptoms. 25% or more of the survey respondents across all income levels reported difficulty finding assistance for their concerns about the physical challenges, especially in their local communities.  Conclusion:   Older survivors of cancer can experience a range of physical changes, amenable to intervention by physical therapy, yet experience challenges obtaining relevant help.

Here, we report the planned primary overall survival analysis, with the aim of defining the benefit of enzalutamide treatment in different prognostic subgroups (synchronous and metachronous high-volume or low-volume disease) and in those who received concurrent docetaxel.  Methods:   ENZAMET is an international, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial conducted at 83 sites (including clinics, hospitals, and university centres) in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, and the USA. Eligible participants were males aged 18 years or older with metastatic, hormone-sensitive prostate adenocarcinoma evident on CT or bone scanning with 99mTc and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using a centralised web-based system and stratified by volume of disease, planned use of concurrent docetaxel and bone antiresorptive therapy, comorbidities, and study site, to receive testosterone suppression plus oral enzalutamide (160 mg once per day) or a weaker standard oral non-steroidal antiandrogen (bicalutamide, nilutamide, or flutamide; control group) until clinical disease progression or prohibitive toxicity. Testosterone suppression was allowed up to 12 weeks before randomisation and for up to 24 months as adjuvant therapy. Concurrent docetaxel (75 mg/m2 intravenously) was allowed for up to six cycles once every 3 weeks, at the discretion of participants and physicians. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This planned analysis was triggered by reaching 470 deaths. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02446405, ANZCTR, ACTRN12614000110684, and EudraCT, 2014-003190-42.  Findings:   Between March 31, 2014, and March 24, 2017, 1125 participants were randomly assigned to receive non-steroidal antiandrogen (n=562; control group) or enzalutamide (n=563). The median age was 69 years (IQR 63-74). This analysis was triggered on Jan 19, 2022, and an updated survival status identified a total of 476 (42%) deaths. After a median follow-up of 68 months (IQR 67-69), the median overall survival was not reached (hazard ratio 0·70 [95% CI 0·58-0·84]; p<0·0001), with 5-year overall survival of 57% (0·53-0·61) in the control group and 67% (0·63-0·70) in the enzalutamide group. Overall survival benefits with enzalutamide were consistent across predefined prognostic subgroups and planned use of concurrent docetaxel. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were febrile neutropenia associated with docetaxel use (33 [6%] of 558 in the control group vs 37 [6%] of 563 in the enzalutamide group), fatigue (four [1%] vs 33 [6%]), and hypertension (31 [6%] vs 59 [10%]). The incidence of grade 1-3 memory impairment was 25 (4%) versus 75 (13%). No deaths were attributed to study treatment.  Interpretation:   The addition of enzalutamide to standard of care showed sustained improvement in overall survival for patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and should be considered as a treatment option for eligible patients.

Methods:   By downloading the GEO database in NCBI, the expression of β2-AR in different prostate tissues was analyzed. We constructed docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer cell lines by the method of dose-escalation. LC3B-labeled stable cells and shAtg5 knockdown stable cells were constructed by lentivirus infection. The molecular mechanism of β2-AR affecting docetaxel sensitivity through apoptosis and autophage were investigated by flow cytometry, mitochondrial membrane potential and western blot. Then we detected the interaction between autophagy and apoptotic by performing immunoprecipitation assay.  Results:   We show that restraining the activity of β2-AR sensitized the cell response and reduced the resistance to docetaxel. The mechanism involves the regulation of β2-AR in the cellular response to docetaxel through apoptosis and autophagy via caspase signaling and Atg5/AMPK/mTOR pathway as well as the effect of β2-AR on the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy via p38 MAPK and JNK/c-Jun/FOXO3a signaling pathways.  Conclusion:   Our data demonstrate that β2-AR inhibitor-induced autophagy and apoptosis contribute to the effectiveness responses to docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer, and in combination with pharmacological agents of β2-AR and autophagy inhibitors may provide a potential therapeutic strategy to enhance the limited capacity of docetaxel to control castration-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Mi Zhang', 'Fangfang Chen', 'Xueqing Sun', 'Yanping Huang', 'Yan Zeng', 'Jinying Chen', 'Shiqi Wu', 'Chen Xu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biochem Biophys Res Commun""","""['Androgen receptor negatively regulates mitotic checkpoint signaling to induce docetaxel resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Resistance to docetaxel in prostate cancer is associated with androgen receptor activation and loss of KDM5D expression.', 'Combined N-terminal androgen receptor and autophagy inhibition increases the antitumor effect in enzalutamide sensitive and enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Exploitation of the Androgen Receptor to Overcome Taxane Resistance in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'PIM1 kinase as a target in prostate cancer: roles in tumorigenesis, castration resistance, and docetaxel resistance.']"""

Culturally and medically constructed as a 'lifestyle-related disease', prostate cancer incidence is directly proportional to the 'Westernisation of eating habits', and societal ageing. Nevertheless, campaigns to advocate routine testing for prostate cancer remain non-existent. Based on an adaptation of the 'sexual scripts' theorising (Gagnon and Simon, 2005), 21 Japanese urologists from Osaka, Kobe and Tokyo, recruited through snowball sampling, were interviewed from 2021 to 2022, to explore how banal nationalisms in medicine-daily medical practice grounded in cultural scripts concerning the Japanese ethnic-self, rather than in medical 'biological causation to explain illness' (Barry and Yuill, 2008, 20), influence their onco-practice. 'Systemic networks' (Bliss et al., 1983) underpinned the analysis of interviews, which indicates that the physicians tend to (re)produce banal nationalisms in medicine through an understanding of an onco-self, who embodies an 'essentialised' version of the Japanese-self concerning rational-thinking, medical-compliancy, and a dependency on familialism and the feminisation of care to cope with cancer. In grappling with prostate cancer, onco-biopedagogy built on the consumption of traditional Japanese food comprehends banal nationalisms in medicine entrenched in prostate onco-practice. Lastly, endorsing and subsidising Traditional Japanese Medicine encompass an element of onco-economics that involves banal nationalisms in medicine. Nonetheless, emotionality underneath decision-making processes, and an onco-self demanding a robotic surgery challenge the validity of banal nationalisms in medicine when grasping onco-practice.""","""['Genaro Castro-Vázquez']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Soc Sci Med""","""['Ethno-essentialisms of the self: A critique of the cultural scripting of obesity in Japan.', 'Cultural Scripts Underpinning Prostate Cancer-Literacy in Japan.', 'Green tea consumption and prostate cancer risk in Japanese men: a prospective study.', 'Prostate tumor and its diagnosis.', 'The geography of prostate cancer and its treatment in Japan.']"""

Nevertheless, prospective data on both parameters are scarce.  Objective:   To prospectively evaluate quality of life and functional outcome, including bowel, urinary, and sexual function, of patients following a watch-and-wait approach.  Design, setting, and participants:   A total of 278 patients with rectal cancer and a clinical complete response or near-complete response after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy were included in 2 prospective cohort studies: a single-center study (March 2014 to October 2017) and an ongoing multicenter study (from September 2017). Patients were observed by a watch-and-wait approach. Additional local excision or total mesorectal excision was performed for residual disease or regrowth. Data were analyzed between April 1, 2021, and August 27, 2021, for patients with a minimum follow-up of 24 months.  Main outcomes and measures:   Quality of life was evaluated with the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer-Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30), EORTC-QLQ-CR38, or EORTC-QLQ-CR29 and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. The score for the questionnaires and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey ranges from 0 to 100. For some scales, a high score indicates a high level of functioning, and for others it indicates a high level of complaints and symptomatology. Functional outcome was assessed by the Low Anterior Resection Syndrome score, Vaizey incontinence score, International Prostate Symptom Score, International Index of Erectile Function, and Female Sexual Function Index.  Results:   Of 278 patients included, 187 were male (67%), and the median age was 66 years (range, 34-85 years). In the first 24 months, 221 patients (80%) were observed by a watch-and-wait approach without requiring surgery, 18 patients (6%) underwent additional local excision, and 39 patients (14%) underwent total mesorectal excision. In general, patients observed by a watch-and-wait approach reported good quality of life, with limited variation over time. At 3 months, 56 of 221 patients (25.3%) reported major bowel dysfunction; at 12 months, 53 patients (24.0%) reported it; and at 24 months, 55 patients (24.9%) reported it. At 24 months, 48 of 151 male patients (31.8%) reported severe erectile dysfunction. For female patients, sexual satisfaction and overall sexual function decreased during follow-up. Patients who underwent local excision reported more major bowel dysfunction (10 of 18 patients [55.6%]) compared with those without additional surgery. Quality-of-life scores, however, were comparable. After total mesorectal excision, patients scored significantly worse on several quality-of-life subscales.  Conclusions and relevance:   Results of this study suggest that patients with rectal cancer who were observed by a watch-and-wait approach had good quality of life, with some patients reporting bowel and sexual dysfunction. Quality of life and functional outcome deteriorated when patients required surgery. These data will be useful in daily care to counsel patients on what to expect from a watch-and-wait approach.""","""['Petra A Custers', 'Marit E van der Sande', 'Brechtje A Grotenhuis', 'Femke P Peters', 'Sander M J van Kuijk', 'Geerard L Beets', 'Stéphanie O Breukink;Dutch Watch-and-Wait Consortium']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Surg""","""['Guiding Patients Through a ""Watch-and-Wait"" Approach for Rectal Cancer-Understanding the Functional Outcomes.', 'Quality of Life in Rectal Cancer Patients After Chemoradiation: Watch-and-Wait Policy Versus Standard Resection - A Matched-Controlled Study.', 'Effect of Neoadjuvant Therapy and Rectal Surgery on Health-related Quality of Life in Patients With Rectal Cancer During the First 2 Years After Diagnosis.', 'Functional Outcomes and Quality of Life after Redo Anastomosis in Patients With Rectal Cancer: An International Multicenter Comparative Cohort Study.', 'A watch-and-wait approach for locally advanced rectal cancer after a clinical complete response following neoadjuvant chemoradiation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'Outcome and Salvage Surgery Following ""Watch and Wait"" for Rectal Cancer after Neoadjuvant Therapy: A Systematic Review.']"""

Methods:   Through single-cell RNA sequencing and multicolor flow cytometry of freshly isolated prostatectomy specimens and matched peripheral blood, we aimed to characterize the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of localized prostate cancer (PCa), including HGPCa and low-grade prostate cancer (LGPCa).  Results:   HGPCa are highly infiltrated by exhausted CD8+ T cells, myeloid cells, and regulatory T cells (TRegs). These HGPCa-infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of exhaustion markers including TIM3, TOX, TCF7, PD-1, CTLA4, TIGIT, and CXCL13. By contrast, a high ratio of activated CD8+ effector T cells relative to TRegs and myeloid cells infiltrate the TME of LGPCa. HGPCa CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) expressed more androgen receptor and prostate-specific membran antigen yet less prostate-specific antigen than the LGPCa CD8+ TILs. The PCa TME was infiltrated by macrophages but these did not clearly cluster by M1 and M2 markers.  Conclusions:   Our study reveals a suppressive TME with high levels of CD8+ T cell exhaustion in localized PCa, a finding enriched in HGPCa relative to LGPCa.

Methods:   All 716 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2008 to 2010 at Skåne University Hospital, Sweden, were included. After excluding patients based on pathological and clinical eligibility criteria, RNA quality, and presence of metastases at diagnosis, a final cohort comprising 316 patients was further analyzed. Expression levels of three genes (IGFBP3, F3, and VGLL3) were measured in archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded core needle biopsies. The gene expression data were combined with clinical parameters (Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen, and clinical tumor stage) to calculate the P-score for each patient. Predictive performance of the P-score in terms of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), distant metastasis and adverse pathological outcomes were investigated.  Results:   The P-score predicted both PCSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.6) and metastasis (HR = 1.46). The P-score had an area under curve (AUC) of 0.93 when predicting the PCSM risk at 10 years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.98), which was significantly better than both D'Amico (AUC: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.90, p < 0.001) and UCSF-CAPRA (AUC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.80-0.96, p < 0.05). Decision curve analysis showed a higher net benefit of the P-score compared to both D'Amico and CAPRA. All three risk scores performed similarly in the prediction of distant metastases. For patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), a higher P-score correlated with adverse pathological features such as pathologic tumor stage T3-4 (p < 0.0001) and ≥International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 3 (p < 0.0001).  Conclusions:   Our findings provide evidence for the prognostic value of the P-score. The P-score predicted the risk for PCSM more accurately than the D'Amico and CAPRA scores. Performance was similar when predicting the risk for development of distant metastases within 10 years. Moreover, the P-score correlated with adverse pathological outcomes in RP specimens.

The aetiology of the disease is not well established, but it has been related to one of the main pathways of regulation of prostate proliferation, mediated by androgens. The androgen receptor (AR) gene encodes the androgen-receptor protein, which functions as a transactivation factor for steroid hormones. It has been proposed that the AR gene transcription levels are mediated by short tandem repeats corresponding to the CAG sequence. However, there are conflicting results in this relationship. We evaluated the expression levels of the AR gene and identified the number of CAG repeats (CAGn) in the Mexican population, establishing the relationship between expression levels and increase in the number of CAG repeats. We evaluated the expression levels of AR in tissue samples of PCa and benign prostate disease, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or prostatitis, to determine the difference in their expression levels. Our results showed a statistically insignificant underexpression of 0.64-fold decrease in AR levels of PCa patients compared to benign prostate disease patients (P = 0.623) and suggest that the number of CAGn was correlated with the relative expression of the AR gene (P = 0.009) and this correlation was positive, moderate, and proportional (ρ = 0.467) and no correlation was found between CAGn with other clinical features.""","""['MartíN Irigoyen Arredondo', 'José Romero Quintana', 'Eliakym Arámbula Meraz', 'Fernando Bergez HernáNdez', 'Fred Luque Ortega', 'Alejandra MartíNez Camberos', 'Marco ÁLvarez Arrazola', 'Enrique Romo MartíNez', 'Dora Cedano Prieto', 'José Contreras Gutiérrez', 'Noemi Garciá Magallanes']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Genet""","""['Polymorphisms in the androgen receptor CAG repeat sequence are related to tumour stage but not to ERG or androgen receptor expression in Malaysian men with prostate cancer.', 'Correlation of androgen receptor CAG repeats with the risks of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.', 'Effect of the androgen receptor CAG repeat polymorphism on transcriptional activity: specificity in prostate and non-prostate cell lines.', 'Androgen receptor CAG repeats and prostate cancer.', 'The androgen receptor CAG repeat: a modifier of carcinogenesis?']"""

However, data are limited for older men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We evaluated the effects of treatment on PF and QoL in older men with mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   Men aged 65+ with mCRPC were enrolled in this multicenter prospective observational study. PF measures included instrumental activities of daily living, grip strength, chair stands, and gait speed. QoL measures included fatigue, pain, mood, and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-General total and sub-scale scores. Outcomes were collected at baseline, three, and six months. Linear mixed effects regression models were used to examine PF and QoL differences over time across various treatment cohorts.  Results:   We enrolled 198 men starting chemotherapy (n = 71), abiraterone (n = 37), enzalutamide (n = 67), or radium-223 (n = 23). At baseline, men starting chemotherapy had worse measures of PF, QoL, pain, and mood than the other groups. Over time, all PF measures remained stable, pain improved, but functional wellbeing (FWB) and mood worsened significantly for all cohorts. However, change over time in all outcomes was not appreciably different between treatment cohorts. Worst-case sensitivity analyses identified attrition (ranging from 22 to 42% by six months) as a major limitation of our study, particularly for the radium-223 cohort.  Discussion:   FWB and mood were most prone to deterioration over time, whereas pain improved with treatment. Although patients initiating chemotherapy had worse baseline PF and QoL, chemotherapy was not associated with significantly greater worsening over time compared to other common therapies for mCRPC. These findings may assist in treatment discussions with patients. However, given the modest sample size, attrition, and timeframe of follow-up, the impact of treatment on PF and QoL outcomes in this setting requires further study, particularly for radium-223.""","""['Helen Yang', 'Valerie S Kim', 'Narhari Timilshina', 'Henriette Breunis', 'Urban Emmenegger', 'Richard Gregg', 'Aaron Hansen', 'George Tomlinson', 'Shabbir M H Alibhai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['The role of frailty in modifying physical function and quality of life over time in older men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A prospective study examining elder-relevant outcomes in older adults with prostate cancer undergoing treatment with chemotherapy or abiraterone.', 'Impact of Abiraterone Acetate plus Prednisone or Enzalutamide on Patient-reported Outcomes in Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: Final 12-mo Analysis from the Observational AQUARiUS Study.', 'Systemic therapy in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a systematic review.', 'Patient experience in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: state of the science.']"""

Material and Methods: Within our institutional database, 265 PCa patients who underwent prostate biopsies and consecutive RARP at our center were enrolled (2018-2022). In the overall population, two independent multivariable logistic regression models (LRMs) predicting the presence of PNI or cribriform variant status at RARP were performed. In low- and intermediate-risk PCa patients according to D'Amico risk classification, three independent multivariable LRMs were fitted to predict upgrading. Results: Of all, 30.9% were low-risk, 18.9% were intermediate-risk and 50.2% were high-risk PCa patients. In the overall population, the rates of the cribriform variant and PNI at RARP were 55.8% and 71.1%, respectively. After multivariable LRMs predicting PNI, total tumor length in biopsy cores (>24 mm [OR: 2.37, p-value = 0.03], relative to <24 mm) was an independent predictor. After multivariable LRMs predicting cribriform variant status, PIRADS (3 [OR:15.37], 4 [OR: 13.57] or 5 [OR: 16.51] relative to PIRADS 2, all p = 0.01) and total tumor length in biopsy cores (>24 mm [OR: 2.47, p = 0.01], relative to <24 mm) were independent predicting factors.

However, the ability to use medical data for machine learning approaches is limited by the specificity of data for a particular medical condition. In this context, the most recent technologies, like generative adversarial networks (GANs), are being looked upon as a potential way to generate high-quality synthetic data that preserve the clinical variability of a condition. However, despite some success, GAN model usage remains largely minimal when depicting the heterogeneity of a disease such as prostate cancer. Previous studies from our group members have focused on automating the quantitative multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) using habitat risk scoring (HRS) maps on the prostate cancer patients in the BLaStM trial. In the current study, we aimed to use the images from the BLaStM trial and other sources to train the GAN models, generate synthetic images, and validate their quality. In this context, we used T2-weighted prostate MRI images as training data for Single Natural Image GANs (SinGANs) to make a generative model. A deep learning semantic segmentation pipeline trained the model to segment the prostate boundary on 2D MRI slices. Synthetic images with a high-level segmentation boundary of the prostate were filtered and used in the quality control assessment by participating scientists with varying degrees of experience (more than ten years, one year, or no experience) to work with MRI images. Results showed that the most experienced participating group correctly identified conventional vs. synthetic images with 67% accuracy, the group with one year of experience correctly identified the images with 58% accuracy, and the group with no prior experience reached 50% accuracy. Nearly half (47%) of the synthetic images were mistakenly evaluated as conventional. Interestingly, in a blinded quality assessment, a board-certified radiologist did not significantly differentiate between conventional and synthetic images in the context of the mean quality of synthetic and conventional images. Furthermore, to validate the usability of the generated synthetic images from prostate cancer MRIs, we subjected these to anomaly detection along with the original images. Importantly, the success rate of anomaly detection for quality control-approved synthetic data in phase one corresponded to that of the conventional images. In sum, this study shows promise that high-quality synthetic images from MRIs can be generated using GANs. Such an AI model may contribute significantly to various clinical applications which involve supervised machine-learning approaches.""","""['Isaac R L Xu', 'Derek J Van Booven', 'Sankalp Goberdhan', 'Adrian Breto', 'Joao Porto', 'Mohammad Alhusseini', 'Ahmad Algohary', 'Radka Stoyanova', 'Sanoj Punnen', 'Anton Mahne', 'Himanshu Arora']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Pers Med""","""['Utility of deep learning networks for the generation of artificial cardiac magnetic resonance images in congenital heart disease.', 'Deepfakes in Ophthalmology: Applications and Realism of Synthetic Retinal Images from Generative Adversarial Networks.', 'Combating COVID-19 Using Generative Adversarial Networks and Artificial Intelligence for Medical Images: Scoping Review.', 'Generative Adversarial Networks for the Creation of Realistic Artificial Brain Magnetic Resonance Images.', 'The role of generative adversarial networks in brain MRI: a scoping review.']"""

Consensus clustering analysis was used to develop LLPS-related molecular subtypes for PCa. The LASSO cox regression analysis was performed to establish a novel LLPS-related index for predicting biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free survival (BCRFS). Preliminary experimental verification was performed. We initially identified a total of 102 differentially expressed LRGs for PCa. Three LLPS related molecular subtypes were identified. Moreover, we established a novel LLPS related signature for predicting BCRFS of PCa patients. Compared to low-risk patients in the training cohort, testing cohort and validating cohort, high-risk populations meant a higher risk of BCR and significantly poorer BCRFS. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.728, 0.762, and 0.741 at 1 year in the training cohort, testing cohort and validating cohort. Additionally, the subgroup analysis indicated that this index was especially suitable for PCa patients with age ≤ 65, T stage III-IV, N0 stage or in cluster 1.

A major program for stress response is the heat shock factor (HSF)-heat shock protein (HSP) system that maintains proteostasis in cells and promotes cancer progression. However, less is known about how the cell stress response is regulated by alternative transcription factors. Here, we show that the SCAN domain (SCAND)-containing transcription factors (SCAN-TFs) are involved in repressing the stress response in cancer. SCAND1 and SCAND2 are SCAND-only proteins that can hetero-oligomerize with SCAN-zinc finger transcription factors, such as MZF1(ZSCAN6), for accessing DNA and transcriptionally co-repressing target genes. We found that heat stress induced the expression of SCAND1, SCAND2, and MZF1 bound to HSP90 gene promoter regions in prostate cancer cells. Moreover, heat stress switched the transcript variants' expression from long noncoding RNA (lncRNA-SCAND2P) to protein-coding mRNA of SCAND2, potentially by regulating alternative splicing. High expression of HSP90AA1 correlated with poorer prognoses in several cancer types, although SCAND1 and MZF1 blocked the heat shock responsiveness of HSP90AA1 in prostate cancer cells. Consistent with this, gene expression of SCAND2, SCAND1, and MZF1 was negatively correlated with HSP90 gene expression in prostate adenocarcinoma. By searching databases of patient-derived tumor samples, we found that MZF1 and SCAND2 RNA were more highly expressed in normal tissues than in tumor tissues in several cancer types. Of note, high RNA expression of SCAND2, SCAND1, and MZF1 correlated with enhanced prognoses of pancreatic cancer and head and neck cancers. Additionally, high expression of SCAND2 RNA was correlated with better prognoses of lung adenocarcinoma and sarcoma. These data suggest that the stress-inducible SCAN-TFs can function as a feedback system, suppressing excessive stress response and inhibiting cancers.""","""['Mona Sheta', 'Kunihiro Yoshida', 'Hideka Kanemoto', 'Stuart K Calderwood', 'Takanori Eguchi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['SCAND1 Reverses Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and Suppresses Prostate Cancer Growth and Migration.', 'MZF1 and SCAND1 Reciprocally Regulate CDC37 Gene Expression in Prostate Cancer.', 'Suppression of heat shock protein 27 using OGX-427 induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and potentiates heat shock protein 90 inhibitors to delay castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Heat shock proteins and heat shock factor 1 in carcinogenesis and tumor development: an update.', 'HSF transcription factor family, heat shock response, and protein intrinsic disorder.']"""

LOX-1 and oxLDL are fundamental in atherosclerosis, where oxLDL/LOX1 promotes ROS generation and NF-κB activation inducing the expression of IL-6, a STAT3 activator. Furthermore, LOX-1/oxLDL function has been associated with other diseases, such as obesity, hypertension, and cancer. In prostate cancer (CaP), LOX-1 overexpression is associated with advanced stages, and its activation by oxLDL induces an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, increasing angiogenesis and proliferation. Interestingly, enzalutamide-resistant CaP cells increase the uptake of acLDL. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor (AR) antagonist for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) treatment, and a high percentage of patients develop a resistance to this drug. The decreased cytotoxicity is promoted in part by STAT3 and NF-κB activation that induces the secretion of the pro-inflammatory program and the expression of AR and its splicing variant AR-V7. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that oxLDL/LOX-1 increases ROS levels and activates NF-κB, inducing IL-6 secretion and the activation of STAT3 in CRPC cells. Furthermore, oxLDL/LOX1 increases AR and AR-V7 expression and decreases enzalutamide cytotoxicity in CRPC.

Despite this, excess mortalities of prostate, breast, and uterus cancer are not available by age group and region from January to December 2020. Therefore, we estimated the excess deaths and excess death rates (per 100,000 habitants) due to prostate, breast, and uterus cancer in 25 Peruvian regions. We did a time series analysis. Prostate, breast, and uterus cancer death data for 25 Peruvian regions were retrieved during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as data for up to 3 years prior (2017-2019) from the Sistema Informatico Nacional de Defunciones at the Ministry of Health of Peru. Deaths in 2020 were defined as observed deaths. The expected deaths (in 2020) were estimated using the average deaths over 3 preceding years (2017, 2018 and 2019). Excess mortality was calculated as the difference between observed mortality and expected mortality in 2020. We estimated that the number of excess deaths and the excess death rates due to prostate, breast, and uterus cancer were 610 deaths (55%; 12.8 deaths per 100,000 men), 443 deaths (43%; 6 deaths per 100,000 women), and 154 deaths (25%; 2 deaths per 100,000 women), respectively. Excess numbers of deaths and excess death rates due to prostate and breast cancer increased with age. These excess deaths were higher in men aged ≥ 80 years (596 deaths (64%) and 150 deaths per 100,000 men) and women aged 70-79 years (229 deaths (58%) and 15 deaths per 100,000 women), respectively. In summary, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there were excess prostate and breast cancer mortalities in 2020 in Peru, while excess uterus cancer mortalities were low.

During treatment, MNPs absorb a part of electromagnetic field (EMF) energy and generate localized heat when subjected to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). The MNP-absorbed EMF energy, which is characterized by a specific absorption rate (SAR), is directly proportional to AMF frequency and the magnitude of transmitting currents in the coil. Furthermore, the AMF penetrates inside tissue and induces eddy currents in electrically conducting tissues, which are proportional to the electric field (J = σE). The eddy currents produce Joule heating (<J·E> = 0.5·σ·E2) in the normal tissue, the rate of energy transfer to the charge carriers from the applied electric fields. This Joule heating contains only the electric field because the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the velocity of the conduction charges, i.e., it does not produce work on moving charge. Like the SAR due to MNP, the electric field produced by the AMF coil is directly proportional to AMF frequency and the magnitude of transmitting currents in the coil. As a result, the Joule heating is directly proportional to the square of the frequency and transmitter current magnitude. Due to the fast decay of magnetic fields from an AMF coil over distance, MNP hyperthermia treatment of deep-seated tumors requires high-magnitude transmitting currents in the coil for clinically achievable MNP distributions in the tumor. This inevitably produces significant Joule heating in the normal tissue and becomes more complicated for a standard MNP hyperthermia approach for deep-seated tumors, such as pancreatic, prostate, liver, lung, ovarian, kidney, and colorectal cancers. This paper presents a novel human-sized AMF coil and MNP hyperthermia system design for safely and effectively treating deep-seated cancers. The proposed design utilizes the spatial distribution of electric and magnetic fields of circular coils. Namely, it first minimizes the SAR due to eddy currents in the normal tissue by moving the conductors away from the tissue (i.e., increasing coils' radii), and second, it increases the magnetic field at the targeted area (z = 0) due to elevated coils (|z| > 0) by increasing the radius of the elevated coils (|z| > 0). This approach is a promising alternative aimed at overcoming the limitation of standard MNP hyperthermia for deep-seated cancers by taking advantage of the transmitter coil's electric and magnetic field distributions in the human body for maximizing AMF in tumor regions and avoiding damage to normal tissue. The human-sized coil's AMF, MNP activation, and eddy current distribution characteristics are investigated for safe and effective treatment of deep-seated tumors using numerical models. Namely, computational results such as AMF, Joule heating SAR, and temperature distributions are presented for a full-body, 3D human model. The SAR and temperature distributions clearly show that the proposed human-sized AMF coil can provide clinically relevant AMF to the region occupied by deep-seated cancers for the application of MNP hyperthermia therapy while causing less Joule heating in the normal tissues than commonly used AMF techniques.""","""['Levan Shoshiashvili', 'Irma Shamatava', 'David Kakulia', 'Fridon Shubitidze']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['Mitigation of eddy current heating during magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia therapy.', 'Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia: Predictive model for temperature distribution.', 'Magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia for treating locally advanced unresectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancers: the role of tumor size and eddy-current heating.', 'Comprehensive understanding of magnetic hyperthermia for improving antitumor therapeutic efficacy.', 'Progress in neuromodulation of the brain: A role for magnetic nanoparticles?']"""

Additionally, 5α,6α-epoxycholesterol is an oxysterol with several biological activities, including regulation of cell proliferation and cholesterol homeostasis. Interestingly, pregnenolone derivatives combining these two modifications were described as potential neuroprotective agents. In this research, novel 16E-arylidene-5α,6α-epoxyepiandrosterone derivatives were synthesized from dehydroepiandrosterone by aldol condensation with different aldehydes followed by a diastereoselective 5α,6α-epoxidation. Their cytotoxicity was evaluated on tumoral and non-tumoral cell lines by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Furthermore, the assessment of the neuroprotective activity of these derivatives was performed in a dopaminergic neuronal cell line (N27), at basal conditions, and in the presence of the neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). Interestingly, some of these steroids had selective cytotoxic effects in tumoral cell lines, with an IC50 of 3.47 µM for the 2,3-dichlorophenyl derivative in the breast cancer cell line (MCF-7).

MB PAA NPs can specifically target proliferating cancer cells as a contrast agent, allowing photoacoustic (PA) imaging to better detect PCa tumors, and also assessing prostate glandular architecture. With the PA signals from the prostates measured simultaneously by a needle hydrophone and a PA and ultrasound (US) dual-imaging system, we conducted PASA and correlated the quantified spectral parameter slopes with the cancer grading from histopathology. The PASA results from 18 mice showed significant differences between normal and cancer, and also between low-score cancer and high-score cancer. This study in the clinically relevant TRAMP model of PCa demonstrated that PA imaging and PASA, powered by MB PAA NPs that can label the PCa microarchitectures in vivo after systemic administration, can detect PCa and, more importantly, evaluate cancer aggressiveness.""","""['Janggun Jo', 'Eamon Salfi', 'Jeff Folz', 'Aaron M Udager', 'Evan Keller', 'Raoul Kopelman', 'Sri-Rajasekhar Kothapalli', 'Guan Xu', 'Xueding Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biosensors (Basel)""","""['Photoacoustic spectral analysis at ultraviolet wavelengths for characterizing the Gleason grades of prostate cancer.', 'Photoacoustic imaging of clofazimine hydrochloride nanoparticle accumulation in cancerous vs normal prostates.', 'Prostate cancer characterization by optical contrast enhanced photoacoustics.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', '3,7-bis(dimethylamino)-phenothiazin-5-ium chloride.']"""

CNF/GNP structures exhibit attractive properties, such as a large surface to volume ratio, which increases the antibody's immobilization capacity and the electroactive area. CNFs/GNP structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, and cyclic voltammetry. Anti-PSA antibodies and HRP were employed for the immune-electrochemical reaction. The detection limit for the device was 5 pg mL-1, with a linear range from 0.01 to 50 ng mL-1. The coefficients of variation within and between assays were lower than 4.40%, and 6.15%, respectively. Additionally, its clinical performance was tested in serum from 30 prostate cancer patients.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find strategies to improve the diagnosis of PCa. Microtechnologies have been gaining ground in biomedical devices, with microfluidics and lab-on-chip systems potentially revolutionizing medical diagnostics. In this paper, it is shown that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) can be detected through an immunoassay performed in a microbead-based microfluidic device after being extracted and purified from a serum sample through an aqueous biphasic system (ABS). Given their well-established status as ABS components for successful bioseparations, ionic liquids (ILs) and polymers were used in combination with buffered salts. Using both IL-based and polymer-based ABS, it was demonstrated that it is possible to detect PSA in non-physiological environments. It was concluded that the ABS that performed better in extracting the PSA from serum were those composed of tetrabutylammonium chloride ([N4444]Cl) and tetrabutylphosphonium bromide ([P4444]Br), both combined with phosphate buffer, and constituted by polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 1000 g/mol (PEG1000) with citrate buffer. In comparison with the assay with PSA prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or human serum in which no ABS-mediated extraction was applied, assays attained lower limits of detection after IL-based ABS-mediated extraction.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the change in survival of patients with de novo metastatic solid cancers during the last 30 years.  Methods:   For this retrospective study, data from almost 2 million patients diagnosed with a solid cancer between January 1, 1989, and December 31, 2018, were obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, with follow-up until January 31, 2021. We classified patients as with or without de novo metastatic disease (M1 or M0, respectively) at diagnosis and determined the proportion with M1 disease over time. Changes in age-standardized net survival were calculated as the difference in the 1- and 5-year survival rates of patients diagnosed in 1989-1993 and 2014-2018.  Results:   Different cancers showed divergent trends in the proportion of M1 disease and increases in net survival for M1 disease (approximately 0-50 percentage points at both 1 and 5 years). Patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors saw the largest increases in 5-year survival, but we also observed substantial 5-year survival increases for patients with neuroendocrine tumors, melanoma, prostate cancer, and breast cancer.  Conclusion:   Over 30 years, the survival of patients with de novo M1 disease modestly and unevenly increased among cancers. Metastatic cancer still remains a very lethal disease.

Specifically in prostate cancers, ORC participates the androgen receptor (AR) regulated genomic amplification and tumor proliferation throughout the entire cell cycle. Of note, ORC6, the smallest subunit of ORC, has been reported to be dysregulated in some types of cancers (including prostate cancer), however, its prognostic and immunological significances remain yet to be elucidated.  Methods:   In the current study, we comprehensively investigated the potential prognostic and immunological role of ORC6 in 33 human tumors using multiple databases, such as TCGA, Genotype-Tissue Expression, CCLE, UCSC Xena, cBioPortal, Human Protein Atlas, GeneCards, STRING, MSigDB, TISIDB, and TIMER2 databases.  Results:   ORC6 expression was significantly upregulated in 29 types of cancers compared to the corresponding normal adjacent tissues. ORC6 overexpression correlated with higher stage and worse prognostic outcomes in most cancer types analyzed. Additionally, ORC6 was involved in the cell cycle pathway, DNA replication, and mismatch repair pathways in most tumor types. A negative correlation was observed between the tumor endothelial cell infiltration and ORC6 expression in almost all tumors, whereas the immune infiltration of T regulatory cell was noted to be statistically positively correlated with the expression of ORC6 in prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, in most tumor types, immunosuppression-related genes, especially TGFBR1 and PD-L1 (CD274), exhibited a specific correlation with the expression of ORC6.  Conclusions:   This comprehensive pan-cancer analysis revealed that ORC6 expression serves as a prognostic biomarker and that ORC6 is involved in the regulation of various biological pathways, the tumor microenvironment, and the immunosuppression status in several human cancers, suggesting its potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value in pan-cancer, especially in prostate adenocarcinoma.""","""['Yuan Lin#', 'Ying Zhang#', 'Zhouting Tuo', 'Liang Gao', 'Demao Ding', 'Liangkuan Bi', 'Dexin Yu', 'Zhengmei Lv', 'Jiani Wang', 'Xin Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Pan-Cancer Analysis of PDIA3: Identifying It as a Potential Biomarker for Tumor Prognosis and Immunotherapy.', 'A comprehensively prognostic and immunological analysis of actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5 in pan-cancer and identification in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Pan-Cancer Analysis of PARP1 Alterations as Biomarkers in the Prediction of Immunotherapeutic Effects and the Association of Its Expression Levels and Immunotherapy Signatures.', 'Identification of SHCBP1 as a potential biomarker involving diagnosis, prognosis, and tumor immune microenvironment across\xa0multiple\xa0cancers.', 'A Pan-Cancer Analysis Reveals the Prognostic and Immunotherapeutic Value of Stanniocalcin-2 (STC2).']"""

The circadian rhythm plays a critical role in disease. Circadian disturbances are often found in patients with tumors and enable to promote tumor development and accelerate its progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that the core clock gene NPAS2 (neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 2) has been implicated in tumors initiation and progression. However, there are few studies on the association between NPAS2 and prostate cancer. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of NPAS2 on cell growth and glucose metabolism in prostate cancer.  Methods:   Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, western blot, GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) databases were used to analyze the expression of NPAS2 in human PCa tissues and various PCa cell lines. Cell proliferation was assessed using MTS, clonogenic assays, apoptotic analyses, and subcutaneous tumor formation experiments in nude mice. Glucose uptake, lactate production, cellular oxygen consumption rate and medium pH were measured to examine the effect of NPAS2 on glucose metabolism. The relation of NPAS2 and glycolytic genes was analyzed based on TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database.  Results:   Our data showed that NPAS2 expression in prostate cancer patient tissue was elevated compared with that in normal prostate tissue. NPAS2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in vitro and suppressed tumor growth in a nude mouse model in vivo. NPAS2 knockdown led to glucose uptake and lactate production diminished, oxygen consumption rate and pH elevated. NPAS2 increased HIF-1A (hypoxia-inducible factor-1A) expression, leading to enhanced glycolytic metabolism. There was a positive correlation with the expression of NPAS2 and glycolytic genes, these genes were upregulated with overexpression of NPAS2 while knockdown of NPAS2 led to a lower level.

Lactoferrin (Lf) is known to regulate immunological activity in tumor cells and inhibit processes associated with tumor metastasis. A delivery of lactoferrin with docetaxel (DTX) in prostate cancer cells in the form of DTX-loaded lactoferrin nanoparticles (DTX-LfNPs) would provide a dual activity wherein the lactoferrin affects metastasis and DTX chemotherapeutically inhibits mitosis and cell division.  Methods:   DTX-LfNPs were prepared using sol-oil chemistry, and particles were characterized using transmission electron microscopy. Antiproliferation activity was analyzed in prostate cancer Mat Ly Lu cells. The target localization and efficacy of DTX-LfNPs were studied in an orthotopic prostate cancer induced by Mat Ly Lu cells in a rat model. Biomarkers were estimated using ELISA and biochemical reactions.  Results:   DTX was loaded in pure Lf nanoparticles without involving any chemical modification and conjugation, thus when these nanoparticles are delivered in cancer cells both DTX and Lf will be present in biologically active forms. DTX-LfNps exhibit a spherical morphology of dimension of 60 ± 10 nm with DTX Encapsulation Efficiency of 62.06 ± 4.07%. Competition experiments using soluble Lf confirm that DTX-LfNPs enter prostate cancer cells through the Lf receptor. DTX-LfNPs exhibit an improved anti-proliferative activity by 2.5 times compared to DTX. Further, analysis of the bioavailability of the drug in the prostate showed that DTX-LfNPs increased drug bioavailability in the prostate by two times more than the DTX. The analysis of efficacy in the Mat Ly Lu cells-induced orthotopic prostate cancer model showed that DTX-LfNPs significantly enhanced the anti-cancer activity compared to DTX in terms of regression of weight and volume of prostate tissue, the efficacy was confirmed by histochemical analysis. Lf provides synergistic activity along with DTX in inhibiting metastasis as assessed by the reduction of lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, TNF alpha, and IFNγ. LfNPs facilitate higher DTX localization along with Lf-mediated protection from DTX-associated toxicity to neutrophils and kidneys as assessed by C-reactive protein, creatinine, and uric acid. Thus, DTX LfNPs show a dual action by enhancing DTX bioavailability in prostate along with Lf-mediated suppression of metastasis as well as DTX-associated toxicity.  Conclusion:   In conclusion, DTX-LfNPs enhance the bioavailability of DTX in the prostate along with Lf-assisted improvement in inhibition of tumor metastasis and drug-associated toxicity.""","""['Chukhu Muj', 'Satyajit Mukhopadhyay', 'Pritikana Jana', 'Anand K Kondapi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Chemother Pharmacol""","""['Lactoferrin nanoparticle mediated targeted delivery of 5-fluorouracil for enhanced therapeutic efficacy.', 'Lactoferrin bioconjugated solid lipid nanoparticles: a new drug delivery system for potential brain targeting.', 'Prostate Cancer Therapy Using Docetaxel and Formononetin Combination: Hyaluronic Acid and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Targeted Peptide Dual Ligands Modified Binary Nanoparticles to Facilitate the in vivo Anti-Tumor Activity.', 'Lactoferrin as a Component of Pharmaceutical Preparations: An Experimental Focus.', 'Lactoferrin and Nanotechnology: The Potential for Cancer Treatment.']"""

PTEN loss of function may occur by inactivating mutation, by deletion, either affecting one copy (hemizygous loss) leading to reduced gene expression or loss of both copies (homozygous) with expression absent. Various murine models have shown that minor reductions in PTEN protein levels strongly influence tumorigenesis. Most PTEN biomarker assays dichotomize PTEN (i.e. presence vs. absence) ignoring the role of one copy loss. We performed a PTEN copy number analysis of 9793 TCGA cases from 30 different tumor types. There were 419 (4.28%) homozygous and 2484 (25.37%) hemizygous PTEN losses. Hemizygous deletions led to reduced PTEN gene expression, accompanied by increased levels of instability and aneuploidy across tumor genomes. Outcome analysis of the pan-cancer cohort showed that losing one copy of PTEN reduced survival to comparable levels as complete loss, and was associated with transcriptomic changes controlling immune response and the tumor microenvironment. Immune cell abundances were significantly altered for PTEN loss, with changes in head and neck, cervix, stomach, prostate, brain, and colon more evident in hemizygous loss tumors. These data suggest that reduced expression of PTEN in tumors with hemizygous loss leads to tumor progression and influences anticancer immune response pathways.""","""['T Vidotto#', 'C M Melo#', 'W Lautert-Dutra', 'L P Chaves', 'R B Reis', 'J A Squire']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Analytic validation of a clinical-grade PTEN immunohistochemistry assay in prostate cancer by comparison with PTEN FISH.', 'Distinct subtypes of genomic PTEN deletion size influence the landscape of aneuploidy and outcome in prostate cancer.', 'PTEN genomic deletion is an early event associated with ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancer.', 'Clinical implications of PTEN loss in prostate cancer.', 'Methodological aspects of the molecular and histological study of prostate cancer: focus on PTEN.']"""

At all time points, significantly higher proportions of RS-RARP patients were continent (p < 0.001). No significant differences in postoperative potency were observed (52% vs. 59%, respectively, p = 0.608). PSMs were more frequent in the RS-RARP group (43% vs. 29%, p = 0.034), especially in locally advanced tumors (pT3: 64.6% vs. 43.8%, p = 0.041-pT2: 23.5% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.329). The one-year BCR-free survival was 82.6% vs. 81.6% in the SA-RARP and RS-RARP groups, respectively (p = 0.567). The median follow-up was 22 [18-27] vs. 24.5 [17-35] months in the RS-RARP and SA-RARP groups, respectively (p = 0.008).  Conclusions:   The transition from SA-RARP to RS-RARP can be safely performed by surgeons proficient in SA-RARP. Continence results after RS-RARP were significantly better at any time point. A higher proportion of PSMs was observed, although it did not result in a worse BCR-free survival.""","""['Edward Lambert', 'Charlotte Allaeys', 'Camille Berquin', 'Pieter De Visschere', 'Sofie Verbeke', 'Ben Vanneste', 'Valerie Fonteyne', 'Charles Van Praet', 'Nicolaas Lumen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""['Retzius-sparing Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Leads to Durable Improvement in Urinary Function and Quality of Life Versus Standard Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy Without Compromise on Oncologic Efficacy: Single-surgeon Series and Step-by-step Guide.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Given the promising diagnostic role of Gal-3 in the urine of PCa patients found in our previous study, its concordant gene and protein expression levels, and its involvement in PCa-related biological processes (e.g., morphogenesis of the prostate gland epithelium), we aimed to investigate this protein immunohistochemically in tumour and normal prostate tissues. Gal-3 protein expression was evaluated in 48 tumour prostate tissues, eight normal prostate tissues and 14 adjacent-normal prostate tissues. Decreased Gal-3 staining was detected in tumour tissues compared with normal tissues. Although Gal-3 staining was decreased in tumour tissues with GS 5-8 and pT2 and pT3 stages compared with normal prostate tissue, no correlation was found between Gal-3 expression and PCa progression. In the present study, the pattern of cellular localization differed between groups, as Gal-3 was predominantly excluded from the nucleus in tumour tissues.

These differences, common for magnetic resonance imaging, pose problems in image quantification, assessment of changes between a baseline and follow-up scan, and hinder performance of image processing and machine learning algorithms.Approach.In this work, we present a comparison on the accuracy of intensity standardization approaches with increasing complexity, for intra- and inter-patient multi-parametric whole-body MRI. Several approaches were used: z-scoring of the intensities, piecewise linear mapping and deformable mapping of intensity distributions into established reference intensity space. For each method, the impact on standardization algorithm on the use of single image or average population distribution reference; as well as, whole image and region of interest were additionally investigated. All methods were validated on a data set of 18 whole-body anatomical and diffusion-weighted MR scans consisting of baseline and follow-up examinations acquired from advanced prostate cancer patients and healthy volunteers.Main results.The piecewise linear intensity standardisation approach provided the best compromise between standardization accuracy and method stability, with average deviations in intensity profile of 0.011-0.027 and mean absolute difference of 0.29-0.37 standard score (intra-patient) and 0.014-0.056 (inter-patient), depending on the type of used MR modality.Significance.Linear piecewise approaches showed the overall best performance across multiple validation metrics, mostly because of its robustness. The inter-patient standardization proved to perform better when using population average reference image; in contrary to intra-patient approach, where the best results were achieved by standardizing towards a reference image taken as the baseline scan.""","""['Jakub Ceranka', 'Frédéric Lecouvet', 'Nicolas Michoux', 'Johan de Mey', 'Hubert Raeymaekers', 'Thierry Metens', 'Jef Vandemeulebroucke']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""['Robust Intensity Standardization in Brain Magnetic Resonance Images.', 'Nonrigid registration of joint histograms for intensity standardization in magnetic resonance imaging.', 'Inter-station intensity standardization for whole-body MR data.', 'Registration strategies for multi-modal whole-body MRI mosaicing.', 'MRI-based attenuation correction for whole-body PET/MRI: quantitative evaluation of segmentation- and atlas-based methods.']"""

Beside adenocarcinoma, BPH is one of the most common diseases in the prostate. Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) is surgical treatment of choice for BPH. Resected tissue fragments are examined in the pathology and belong to the most commonly submitted urologic specimens. Up to date, pathophysiology of BPH is not yet completely understood. Different hormones such as androgens, dihydrotestosterone, estrogens as well as growth factors, inflammation, and environmental influences are important in the process. The diagnosis of BPH is usually straightforward. In this context, it is important to mention incidental findings, which may come along as ""bad surprises"" while examining TURP tissue fragments. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) or incidental acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate as well as the potential preneoplastic atypical adenomatoid hyperplasia (AAH) represent a few examples. According to literature, the histologic examination of TURP tissue reveals a high-grade PIN in up to 5%. Incidental adenocarcinoma is encountered in 5-13%.

When CaP progressed to castration-resistant CaP (CRPC), the prognosis is poor. Although CaP/CRPC and BPH frequently coexist in prostate, the inter-relational mechanism between them is largely unknown.  Methods:   Single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk-RNA sequencing, and microarray data of BPH, CaP in the Gene Expression Omnibus database were obtained and comprehensively analyzed. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) and lasso regression analysis were performed to explore the potential biomarkers.  Results:   With WGCNA, five modules in BPH, two in CaP, and three in CRPC were identified as significant modules. Pathway enrichment analysis found that the epigenetics and chromosomal-related signaling were dominantly clustered in the CaP group but not in BPH and CRPC. Lasso regression analysis was used to analyze further the mutual genes between the BPH module and the CRPC module. As a result, DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L were significantly correlated with the transcriptomic features in both BPH and CRPC. More importantly, the role of the four gene signatures was validated in two independent anti-PD-1 immunotherapy cohort.  Conclusion:   This study revealed the shared gene signatures and immune microenvironment between BPH and CRPC. The identified hub genes, including DDA1, ERG28, OGFOD1, and OXA1L, might be potential therapeutic targets for facilitating immunotherapy in prostate cancer.""","""['Fei Wu', 'Hao Ning', 'Yang Sun', 'Haihu Wu', 'Jiaju Lyu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Aging Male""","""['Identification of Novel Diagnosis Biomarkers for Therapy-Related Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer.', 'Expression of MUS81 Mediates the Sensitivity of Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer to Olaparib.', 'Identification of castration-resistant prostate cancer-related hub genes using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.', 'De novo steroid biosynthesis in human prostate cell lines and biopsies.', 'Progesterone receptor in the prostate: A potential suppressor for benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer.']"""

Here, we analyzed the anticancer effects of metformin, which has a good toxicity profile and is inexpensive.  Method:   From January 2010 to December 2019, analysis was conducted retrospectively in a cohort from the National Health Insurance Service database. The wash-out period was set for cancer diagnosis in 2010 and 2011, and subjects (105,279) diagnosed with prostate cancer (ICD C61) from 2012 to 2014 were excluded The final subjects (105,216) were defined as the metformin administration group when they took metformin for 180 days or more from January 2012 to December 2019. The non-metformin group was defined as those who took less than 180 days from January 2012 to December 2019. The prevalence of prostate cancer according to metformin administration and the risk according to the cumulative duration of metformin were analyzed.  Results:   A total of 105,216 people were included in this study, with 59,844 in the metformin group and 45,372 in the metformin non-administration group. When calculating HRs (Hazard Rate) according to the cumulative period of metformin administration, metformin administration period length was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q2 HR = 0.791 95% CI: 0.773-0.81, Q3 HR = 0.634 95% CI: 0.62-0.649, Q4 HR = 0.571 95% CI: 0.558-0.585).

We assessed differences in ISR intensity and patient quality of life (QOL) between degarelix 80 mg and 480 mg, a three-month formulation launched in 2020 in Japan.  Patients and methods:   We prospectively analyzed 25 patients with advanced prostate cancer. ISR intensity and patient QOL were evaluated before and after switching from degarelix 80 mg to 480 mg. A visual analogue scale (VAS) and faces rating scale (FRS) were applied to assess the ISRs. We applied a rating format from the M. D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) to assess patient QOL.  Results:   For degarelix 80 mg and a first dose of 480 mg, the incidence rate of ISRs was 84% and 92%, respectively (p=0.083). ISR pain on the third day after injection scored by VAS was 2.7±2.8 and 5.2±2.7, respectively (p<0.001). Other ISR findings such as redness, induration, swelling, warmth, and itching were significantly worse for degarelix 480 mg than for 80 mg. In the category of patient QOL, interference with activities of daily living such as general activity was significantly worse after degarelix 480 mg (p=0.003). However, 80% of patients were able to continue degarelix 480 mg during the nine months of follow-up.

The aim of the study was to investigate the postoperative ambulatory status of neurologically impaired metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) patients who underwent laminectomy and evaluate predictors of postoperative ambulation recovery after laminectomy for MSCC.  Patients and methods:   We included 175 patients who underwent decompressive surgery for MSCC. Changes in the Frankel grade (FG) were evaluated perioperatively. Among all patients, 113 were unable to walk preoperatively and were divided into two groups: 70 and 43 patients in the ambulation-regained and ambulation-not regained postoperatively groups, respectively. The percentage of patients eligible for postoperative chemotherapy and overall survival rate in each group were investigated. Furthermore, predictors of postoperative ambulation recovery after laminectomy for MSCC were examined.  Results:   The most common primary tumor sites were the lung, prostate, and breast. FG improved with surgery in 80 cases, remained unchanged in 94 cases, and worsened in one case. In the ambulation-regained group, 70% were eligible for postoperative chemotherapy, while only 26% of the not-regained group were eligible for postoperative chemotherapy. The postoperative survival rate of the ambulation-regained group was significantly better than that of the not-regained group. Univariate predictors for not regaining the ability to walk were Karnofsky Performance Status ≤40 prior to surgery, FG B prior to surgery, and time to surgery since the inability to walk >48 h.

Raster scanning intensity modulated radiotherapy (RS-IMRT) has a potential of improving treatment efficacy, introducing shorter treatment time, better target dose uniformity, and lower organ at risk (OAR) dose. The purpose of the study was to develop a fluence optimization system for RS-IMRT.  Patients and methods:   RS-IMRT plans were created for five prostate cancer patients treated with the Novalis system and parameters were compared to the Novalis treatment plans. From 80 nodes available for the CyberKnife, twelve nodes were arbitrarily selected. On the beam's eye view of each beam, a 100×100 matrix of optimization points was created at the target center plane. The beam fluence map was optimized using the attraction-repulsion model (ARM). The beam fluence maps were converted to the scanning sequence using the ARM and a final dose calculation was performed.  Results:   For planning target volume (PTV), RS-IMRT plans showed higher dose covering 2% of the volume (D2%) and lower D98% compared to the Novalis plans. However, the homogeneity was within our Institutional clinical protocol. The RS-IMRT plans showed significantly lower OAR dose parameters including bladder volume receiving 100% of prescribed dose (V100%) and dose delivered to 5 cm3 of rectum (D5 cc).  Conclusion:   We developed a fluence optimization system for RS-IMRT that performs the entire RS-IMRT treatment planning process, including scanning sequence optimization and final dose calculation. The RS-IMRT was capable of generating clinically acceptable plans.""","""['Yuichi Akino', 'Hiroya Shiomi', 'Nobuhisa Mabuchi', 'Norihisa Masai', 'Ryoong-Jin Oh', 'Kazuhiko Ogawa']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anticancer Res""","""['Development of raster scanning IMRT using a robotic radiosurgery system.', 'A quantitative study of IMRT delivery effects in commercial planning systems for the case of oesophagus and prostate tumours.', 'Dose gradient near target-normal structure interface for nonisocentric CyberKnife and isocentric intensity-modulated body radiotherapy for prostate cancer.', 'Radiotherapy of prostate cancer with or without intensity modulated beams: a planning comparison.', 'Towards automated on-line adaptation of 2-Step IMRT plans: QUASIMODO phantom and prostate cancer cases.']"""

Traditional counseling models are unlikely to enable time-sensitive therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and clinical impact of an alternative hereditary genetic testing model.  Materials and methods:   As part of a multicenter, single-arm prospective trial, individuals with advanced prostate cancer were referred by their oncologist for testing of 14 genes associated with hereditary prostate cancer. Pretest education (brochure and video) was provided in the oncology clinic. Questionnaires assessing participant satisfaction with both pretest education and decision to undergo genetic testing were collected. A genetic counselor contacted participants by phone to obtain family history and discuss results. Medical records were queried to determine whether a change in clinical management was discussed.  Results:   Of 501 participants consented to germline analysis, 51 (10.2%) had at least 1 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant. Change in treatment was discussed with 22/48 (45.8%) of eligible participants who tested positive. Feasibility of this model was assessed by participant satisfaction and turnaround time. Average±SD satisfaction with the pretest education (15.5±2.2, 4-20 scale) and with the decision to undergo genetic testing (17.1±2.9, 4-20 scale) were both high. Results were returned 20 days (median) after sample collection.  Conclusions:   Oncologist-initiated germline genetic testing in collaboration with a genetic counselor is a feasible approach to testing advanced prostate cancer patients with impactful clinical actionability. The testing model and educational material serve as resources to clinicians treating prostate cancer patients.""","""['Kelsey E Breen', 'Heather Symecko', 'Kelsey Spielman', 'Rebecca Gebert', 'Ibrahim H Shah', 'Stacy Pundock', 'Melissa Batson', 'Vivek K Narayan', 'Zsofia K Stadler', 'Karen A Autio', 'Wassim Abida', 'Daniel C Danila', 'Howard I Scher', 'Michael J Morris', 'Jada G Hamilton', 'Mark E Robson', 'Susan M Domchek', 'Maria I Carlo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Technology-enhanced AcceleRation of Germline Evaluation for Therapy (TARGET): A randomized controlled trial of a pretest patient-driven webtool vs. genetic counseling for prostate cancer germline testing.', 'Satisfaction With Clinician-Led Germline Genetic Counseling in Patients With Prostate Cancer.', 'Mainstream germline genetic testing in men with metastatic prostate cancer: design and protocol for a multicenter observational study.', 'Bringing Prostate Cancer Germline Genetics into Clinical Practice.', 'Genetic Counseling for Men with Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   Urine samples were collected from each PCa and BPH patient. miRNA-21 relative expression against the reference gene was analyzed and compared between the two. miRNA expression was then analyzed using the comparative quantification method to find the fold change. miR-21 validity in identifying PCa patients was performed by quantifying the sensitivity and specificity using samples in this study.  Result:   The results of this study indicated that miRNA-21 relative expression against miRNA-16 in PCa and BPH showed 12.95 differences in fold change. Moreover, using prostate biopsy as the gold standard to differentiate PCa and BPH, miRNA-21 Cq expression has 100% sensitivity and 75% specificity in differentiating the two.  Conclusion:   miRNA-21 relative expression can be used to discriminate PCa from BPH by using a urine sample. Furthermore, the expression of miR-21 has higher sensitivity than PSA; therefore, miR-21 has a high potential to be analyzed and developed further for clinical diagnosis of prostate cancer.""","""['Regina R Gunawan', 'Indwiani Astuti', 'H Raden Danarto']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Detection of miRNAs in urine of prostate cancer patients.', 'Urinary microRNA-based signature improves accuracy of detection of clinically relevant prostate cancer within the prostate-specific antigen grey zone.', 'Diagnostic Value of Prostate-Specific Antigen Combined with Plasma miRNA-149 Expression in Patients with Prostate Cancer Based on Experimental Data and Bioinformatics.', 'Proteomics in diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Molecular forms of serum prostate-specific antigen: the clinical usefulness of percent free PSA to discriminate prostate cancer from BPH.']"""
