The present study investigates the efficacy and safety of an oral metronomic chemo-hormonal regimen including cyclophosphamide, etoposide, estramustine, ketoconazole and prednisolone (KEES) administered in a consecutive biweekly schedule.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study in two Swedish regions was conducted. Overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), biochemical response rate (bRR) and toxicities were analyzed.  Results:   One hundred and twenty-three patients treated with KEES after initial treatment with at least a taxane or an androgen-receptor targeting agents (ARTA) were identified. Of those, 95 (77%) had received both agents and were the primary analysis population. Median (95% CI) OS and PFS in the pre-treated population were 12.3 (10.1-15.0) and 4.4 (3.8-5.5) months, respectively. Biochemical response, defined as ≥ 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reduction, occurred in 26 patients (29%), and any PSA reduction in 59 (65%). PFS was independent of prior treatments used, and KEES seemed to be effective in late treatment lines. The bRR was higher compared to historical data of metronomic treatments in docetaxel and ARTA pre-treated populations. In multivariable analyses, performance status (PS) ≥ 2 and increasing alkaline phosphatase (ALP) predicted for worse OS. Nausea, fatigue, thromboembolic events and bone marrow suppression were the predominant toxicities.  Conclusions:   KEES demonstrated meaningful efficacy in heavily pre-treated CRPC patients, especially those with PS 0-1 and lower baseline ALP, and had an acceptable toxicity profile.""","""['Mustafa Asowed', 'Nils O Elander', 'Linn Pettersson', 'Maria Ekholm', 'Dimitrios Papantoniou']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['The role of carboplatin in combination with paclitaxel in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Metronomic oral cyclophosphamide chemotherapy possibly contributes to stabilization of disease in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a prospective analysis of consecutive cases.', 'Anticancer Activity and Tolerance of Treatments Received Beyond Progression in Men Treated Upfront with Androgen Deprivation Therapy With or Without Docetaxel for Metastatic Castration-naïve Prostate Cancer in the GETUG-AFU 15 Phase 3 Trial.', 'Chemotherapy with or without estramustine for treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

However, most prostate MRF studies were performed with spiral acquisitions that are sensitive to B0 inhomogeneities and consequent blurring. In this work, a radial MRF acquisition with a novel subspace reconstruction technique was developed to enable fast T1/T2 mapping in the prostate in under 4 min. The subspace reconstruction exploits the extensive temporal correlations in the MRF dictionary to pre-compute a low dimensional space for the solution and thus reduce the number of radial spokes to accelerate the acquisition. Iterative reconstruction with the subspace model and additional regularization of the signal representation in the subspace is performed to minimize the number of spokes and maintain matching quality and SNR. Reconstruction accuracy was assessed using the ISMRM NIST phantom. In-vivo validation was performed on two healthy subjects and two prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The longitudinal repeatability was quantified using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) in one of the healthy subjects by repeated scans over 1 year. One prostate cancer patient was scanned at three time points, before initiating therapy and following brachytherapy and external beam radiation. Changes in the T1/T2 maps obtained with the proposed method were quantified. The prostate, peripheral and transitional zones, and visible dominant lesion were delineated for each study, and the statistics and distribution of the quantitative mapping values were analyzed. Significant image quality improvements compared with standard reconstruction methods were obtained with the proposed subspace reconstruction method. A notable decrease in the spread of the T1/T2 values without biasing the estimated mean values was observed with the subspace reconstruction and agreed with reported literature values. The subspace reconstruction enabled visualization of small differences in T1/T2 values in the tumor region within the peripheral zone. Longitudinal imaging of a volunteer subject yielded CCC of 0.89 for MRF T1, and 0.81 for MRF T2 in the prostate gland. Longitudinal imaging of the prostate patient confirmed the feasibility of capturing radiation treatment related changes. This work is a proof-of-concept for a high resolution and fast quantitative mapping using golden-angle radial MRF combined with a subspace reconstruction technique for longitudinal treatment response assessment in subjects undergoing radiation treatment.""","""['Victoria Y Yu', 'Ricardo Otazo', 'Can Wu', 'Ergys Subashi', 'Manuel Baumann', 'Peter Koken', 'Mariya Doneva', 'Peter Mazurkewitz', 'Daniel Shasha', 'Michael Zelefsky', 'Laura Cervino', 'Ouri Cohen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Magn Reson Imaging""","""['Optimized multi-axis spiral projection MR fingerprinting with subspace reconstruction for rapid whole-brain high-isotropic-resolution quantitative imaging.', 'Toward magnetic resonance fingerprinting for low-field MR-guided radiation therapy.', 'Initial assessment of 3D magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) towards quantitative brain imaging for radiation therapy.', 'MR fingerprinting of the prostate.', 'Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting: Technical Developments and Initial Clinical Validation.']"""

The preservation of more native structures compared to conventional robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) may lead to faster recovery of urinary function, fewer penile changes, and decreased inguinal hernia sequelae, but may have a higher risk for positive surgical margins and poorer cancer control. However, high-level evidence is absent. The PARTIAL trial is a surgical randomized controlled trial (RCT) aiming to bridge this evidence gap (NCT05155501).  Methods:   We describe a prospective RCT with a projected enrollment of 600 men randomized to PFS-RARP vs. RARP. The primary outcome is cancer control (positive surgical margins and prostate-specific antigen failure) and secondary outcomes include health-related quality of life pertaining to urinary and sexual function, decision regret, and adverse events (30-day complications, inguinal hernias, penile shortening, and Peyronie's disease). The anticipated duration of trial participation is 24 months. Study participation is incentivized with the use of innovative methodologies such as a novel, two-stage informed consent and a validated web-based interface to monitor patient-reported symptoms and empower individuals to improve their recovery.  Conclusion:   If PFS-RARP is non-inferior to RARP in terms of cancer control and has better functional outcomes, it should be the surgical standard of care for men with localized prostate cancer. Using the innovative two-stage consent process, completion of the trial will not only provide much needed evidence on one of the most common cancer surgeries but also insight on improving surgical RCT methodology.

These systems are impractical in pre-hospital and resource-limited settings, where refrigeration and electricity are not reliable or even available. Here, we develop an innovative technology using metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a novel class of organic-inorganic hybrids with high thermal stability, as encapsulates for preserving the integrity of protein biomarkers in biofluids under ambient or non-refrigerated storage conditions. We encapsulate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in whole patient plasma using hydrophilic zeolitic imidazolate framework-90 (ZIF-90) for preservation at 40 °C for 4 weeks and eventual on-demand reconstitution for antibody-based assays with recovery above 95% compared to storage at -20 °C. Without ZIF-90 encapsulation, only 10-30% of the PSA immunoactivity remained. Furthermore, we demonstrate encapsulation of multiple cancer biomarker proteins in whole patient plasma using ZIF-8 or ZIF-90 encapsulants for eventual on-demand reconstitution and analysis after 1 week at 40 °C. Overall, MOF encapsulation of patient biofluids is important as climate change may be affecting the stability and increase costs of maintaining biospecimen cold chain custody for the collection, transportation, and storage of biospecimens prior to analysis or for biobanking regardless of any countries' affluence.""","""['Yixuan Wang', 'Jeremiah J Morrissey', 'Prashant Gupta', 'Pradeep Chauhan', 'Russell K Pachynski', 'Peter K Harris', 'Aadel Chaudhuri', 'Srikanth Singamaneni']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""ACS Appl Mater Interfaces""","""['Enhancing the Stability of COVID-19 Serological Assay through Metal-Organic Framework Encapsulation.', 'Metal-Organic Framework Encapsulation Preserves the Bioactivity of Protein Therapeutics.', 'The effects of NaCl on enzyme encapsulation by zeolitic imidazolate frameworks-8.', 'MOF-derived nanoporous carbons with diverse tunable nanoarchitectures.', 'Applications of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) in bone tissue engineering: A review.']"""

The presence of HP1α, also known as the heterochromatin protein 1α, is required for the creation of higher-order chromatin structures. However, little is known about HP1α that serves roles in the pathogenesis of PCa. The primary purpose of our research was to investigate alterations in the levels of HP1α expression and to plan a series of tests to validate the function of HP1α in PCa.  Method:   Information on HP1α expression in PCa and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues were gathered using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) databases. RT-qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess HP1α mRNA and protein expression in several human PCa tissues and cell lines. The CCK8 assay, clone formation assay, and transwell assay were used to examine biological activities including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. The expression of proteins connected to apoptosis and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was examined using Western blot. The tumorigenic effect of HP1α was also verified by in vivo experiments.  Result:   HP1α expression was much higher in PCa than in BPH tissues and cells, and was positively correlated with the Gleason score of PCa. In vitro experiments showed that HP1α knockdown could inhibit the ability of proliferation, invasion, and migration of PC3 and LNCaP cells, and promote cell apoptosis and EMT. In vivo experiments showed that HP1α knockdown inhibited tumorigenesis in mice.  Conclusion:   Our findings indicate that HP1α expression promotes PCa development and might be a novel therapeutic target for the diagnosis or treatment of PCa.""","""['Siyang Zhang', 'Hengran Li', 'Chong Shen', 'Fenghong Cao', 'Shaosan Kang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Biol Rep""","""['MicroRNA-132/212 Upregulation Inhibits TGF-β-Mediated Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition of Prostate Cancer Cells by Targeting SOX4.', 'The involvement of FBP1 in prostate cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transition, invasion and metastasis by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'TERF1 downregulation promotes the migration and invasion of the PC3 prostate cancer cell line as a target of miR‑155.', 'hnRNPM, a potential mediator of YY1 in promoting\xa0the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of prostate cancer cells.', 'βKlotho inhibits androgen/androgen receptor‑associated epithelial‑mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer through inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling.']"""

Here, we evaluated how retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor-suppressor loss-of-function (LOF), one of the most frequent alterations in human cancer and associated with lineage plasticity, poor prognosis, and therapeutic outcomes, alters the TME, and whether therapeutic strategies targeting the molecular consequences of Rb loss enhance ICB efficacy. We performed bioinformatics analysis to elucidate the impact of endogenous Rb LOF on the immune TME in human primary and metastatic tumors. Next, we used isogenic murine models of Rb-deficient prostate cancer for in vitro and in vivo mechanistic studies to examine how Rb loss and bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) domain inhibition (BETi) reprograms the immune landscape, and evaluated in vivo therapeutic efficacy of BETi, singly and in combination with ICB and androgen deprivation therapy. Rb loss was enriched in non-T-cell-inflamed tumors, and Rb-deficient murine tumors demonstrated decreased immune infiltration in vivo. The BETi JQ1 increased immune infiltration into the TME through enhanced tumor cell STING/NF-κB activation and type I IFN signaling within tumor cells, resulting in differential macrophage and T-cell-mediated tumor growth inhibition and sensitization of Rb-deficient prostate cancer to ICB. BETi can reprogram the immunologically cold Rb-deficient TME via STING/NF-κB/IFN signaling to sensitize Rb-deficient prostate cancer to ICB.

We evaluated the role of focal therapy in patients 70 years and older as an alternative management modality.  Materials and methods:   A total of 649 patients across 11 UK sites receiving focal high-intensity focused ultrasound or cryotherapy between June 2006 and July 2020 reported within the UK-based HEAT (HIFU Evaluation and Assessment of Treatment) and ICE (International Cryotherapy Evaluation) registries were evaluated. Primary outcome was failure-free survival, defined by need for more than 1 focal reablation, progression to radical treatment, development of metastases, need for systemic treatment, or prostate cancer-specific death. This was compared to the failure-free survival in patients undergoing radical treatment via a propensity score weighted analysis.  Results:   Median age was 74 years (IQR: 72, 77) and median follow-up 24 months (IQR: 12, 41). Sixty percent had intermediate-risk disease and 35% high-risk disease. A total of 113 patients (17%) required further treatment. Sixteen had radical treatment and 44 required systemic treatment. Failure-free survival was 82% (95% CI: 76%-87%) at 5 years. Comparing patients who had radical therapy to those who had focal therapy, 5-year failure-free survival was 96% (95% CI: 93%-100%) and 82% (95% CI: 75%-91%) respectively (P < .001). Ninety-three percent of those in the radical treatment arm had received radiotherapy as their primary treatment with its associated use of androgen deprivation therapy, thereby leading to potential overestimation of treatment success in the radical treatment arm, especially given the similar metastases-free and overall survival rates seen.

Digital images are hematoxylin-eosin-like and can be shared and interpreted remotely. In urology, FCM has been successfully applied for prostate tissue interpretation, either during biopsy and radical prostatectomy. Possible applications of FCM may reflect those of frozen section analysis and can be extended to all fields in which the intra-operative microscopical control is advisable.  Materials and methods:   This is an investigative prospective case series that aims to explore FCM feasibility in novel surgical settings and provide a depiction of FCM digital images in those fields. The definite purpose is to check the accuracy of surgical specimen during the following interventions: (a) trans-urethral resection of bladder tumors, to confirm the presence of muscular layer; (b) biopsy of a retroperitoneal mass, to check for the location and quality of cores; (c) training in robotic radical prostatectomy, to control surgical margins after a nerve sparing performed by a trainee. To this aim, we collected FCM images during seven surgical procedures. FCM findings were compared to those from the final histopathological analysis and the agreement was assessed.  Results:   In all cases, FCM digital images were obtained in the OR.

RFA has demonstrated effective palliation of osseous metastases in small clinical studies with short-term follow-up; however, a long-term assessment with robust subject numbers is lacking.  Materials and methods:   Prospective assessments were conducted at Baseline, 3 days, 1 week, and 1, 3, 6, and 12-months. Pain and quality of life were measured prior to RFA and postoperatively using the Brief Pain Inventory, European Quality of Life-5 Dimension, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Care Quality of Life Questionnaire for palliative care. Radiation, chemotherapy and opioid usage, and related adverse events were collected.  Results:   206 subjects were treated with RFA at 15 institutions in OPuS One. Worst pain, average pain, pain interference and quality of life significantly improved at all visits starting 3 days post-RFA and sustained to 12 months (P < 0.0001). Post hoc analysis found neither systemic chemotherapy nor local radiation therapy at the index site of RFA influenced worst pain, average pain, or pain interference.

Methods:   all patients treated with RS-RARP for prostate cancer at a single high-volume European institution, between 2010 and 2021, were identified and stratified according to p-TURP status. Logistic, Poisson and Cox regression models were performed.  Results:   Of 1386 RS-RARP patients, 99 (7%) had history of p-TURP. Between p-TURP and no-TURP patients no differences were detected regarding both intra- and post-operative complications (p values = 0.9). The rates of immediate UCR were 40 vs 67% in p-TURP vs no-TURP patients (p < 0.001). At 12 months from RS-RARP, the rates of UCR were 68 vs 94% in p-TURP vs no-TURP patients (p < 0.001). At multivariable logistic and Cox regression models, p-TURP was independently associated, respectively, with lower immediate (odds ratio [OR]: 0.32, p < 0.001) and 12-months UCR (hazard ratio: 0.54, p < 0.001).

Objective:   To assess the efficacy and safety of salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) reirradiation in this setting and evaluate prognostic factors.  Design, setting, and participants:   We conducted a large multicenter retrospective series that included 117 patients who were treated with salvage SBRT for local recurrence in the prostatic bed after RP and radiotherapy in 11 centers across three countries.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Progression-free survival (PFS; biochemical, clinical, or both) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Biochemical recurrence was defined as prostate-specific antigen nadir +0.2 ng/ml, confirmed by a second increasing measure. The cumulative incidence of late toxicities was estimated using the Kalbfleisch-Prentice method by considering recurrence or death as a competing event.  Results and limitations:   The median follow-up was 19.5 mo. The median SBRT dose was 35 Gy. The median PFS was 23.5 mo (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 17.6-33.2). In the multivariable models, the volume of the recurrence and its contact with the urethrovesical anastomosis were significantly associated with PFS (hazard ratio [HR]/10 cm3 = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.08-1.96; p = 0.01 and HR = 3.35; 95% CI, 1.38-8.16; p = 0.008, respectively). The 3-yr cumulative incidence of grade ≥2 late GU or GI toxicity was 18% (95% CI, 10-26). In the multivariable analysis, a recurrence in contact with the urethrovesical anastomosis and D2% of the bladder were significantly associated with late toxicities of any grade (HR = 3.65; 95% CI, 1.61-8.24; p = 0.002 and HR/10 Gy = 1.88; 95% CI, 1.12-3.16; p = 0.02, respectively).  Conclusions:   Salvage SBRT for local recurrence in the prostate bed may offer encouraging control and acceptable toxicity. Therefore, further prospective studies are warranted.

Cuproptosis, a copper-dependent programmed cell death mechanism, plays a vital role in tumor development, therapy resistance, and immune microenvironment regulation in PCA. However, research on cuproptosis in prostate cancer is still in its early stages.  Methods:   Using the publicly available datasets TCGA and GEO, we first acquired the transcriptome and clinical information of PCA patients. The expression of cuprotosis-related genes (CRG) was identified and a prediction model was established based on LASSO-COX method. The predictive performance of this model was evaluated based on Kaplan-Meier method. Using GEO datasets, we further confirmed the critical genes level in the model. Tumor responses to immune checkpoint (ICP) inhibitors were predicted based on Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) score. The Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) was utilized to forecast drug sensitivity in cancer cells, whereas the GSVA was employed to analyze enriched pathways related to the cuproptosis signature. Subsequently, the function of PDHA1 gene in PCA was verified.  Results:   A predictive risk model on basis of five cuproptosis-related genes (ATP7B, DBT, LIPT1, GCSH, PDHA1) were established. The progression free survival of low-risk group was obviously longer than the high-risk group, and exhibit better response to ICB therapy.Furthermore,PDHA1 is very important in the pathological process of PCA according to regressions analysis result, and the validation of external data sets were conducted. High PDHA1 expression patients with PCA not only had a shorter PFS and were less likely to benefit from ICB treatment, but they were also less responsive to multiple targeted therapeutic drugs. In preliminary research, PDHA1 knockdown significantly decreased the proliferation and invasion of PCA cells.  Conclusion:   This study established a novel cuproptosis-related gene-based prostate cancer prediction model that accurately predicts the prognosis of PCA patients. The model benefits individualized therapy and can assist clinicians in making clinical decisions for PCA patients. Furthermore, our data show that PDHA1 promotes PCA cell proliferation and invasion while modulating the susceptibility to immunotherapy and other targeted therapies. PDHA1 can be regarded as an important target for PCA therapy.""","""['Bisheng Cheng', 'Chen Tang', 'Junjia Xie', 'Qianghua Zhou', 'Tianlong Luo', 'Qiong Wang', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Life Sci""","""['System analysis based on the cuproptosis-related genes identifies LIPT1 as a novel therapy target for liver hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Cuproptosis Regulates Microenvironment and Affects Prognosis in Prostate Cancer.', 'A novel cuproptosis-related subtypes and gene signature associates with immunophenotype and predicts prognosis accurately in neuroblastoma.', 'Identification of cuproptosis-related subtypes, construction of a prognosis model, and tumor microenvironment landscape in gastric cancer.', 'Identification of a novel cuproptosis-related gene signature and integrative analyses in patients with lower-grade gliomas.']"""

The development of novel and highly efficient therapeutic strategies is strongly recommended to treat prostate cancer. Cyperaceae are an ecologically and economically important family of plants with several pharmacological effects. However, the biological efficacy of Cyperus exaltatus var. iwasakii (CE) is unknown.  Purpose:   This study aimed to investigate the antitumor effect of the ethanol extract of CE against prostate cancer.  Methods:   In vitro antitumor efficacy of CE was explored by the MTT assay, cell counting assay, FACS analysis, immunoblot, wound-healing migration, invasion assay, zymographic assay, and EMSA in prostate cancer cells, DU145 and LNCaP. For in vivo experiments, xenograft mice were injected with LNCaP cells. Histology (H&E and Ki-67) and biochemical enzyme assay were then performed. The toxicity test was evaluated by an acute toxicity assay. The phytochemical constituents of CE were identified by spectrometric and chromatographic analyses.  Results:   CE exerted a significant antiproliferative effect against prostate cancer cells. CE-induced antiproliferative cells were associated with cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 (cyclin D1/CDK4, cyclin E/CDK2, p21Waf1) in DU145 cells, but G2/M (ATR, CHK1, Cdc2, Cdc25c, p21Waf1, and p53) in LNCaP cells. CE stimulated the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and AKT in DU145 cells, but only p38 MAPK phosphorylation was increased in LNCaP cells. CE treatment suppressed migration and invasion in the two types of prostate cancer cells by inhibiting MMP-9 activity through the regulation of transcription factors, such as AP-1 and NF-κB. In vivo experiments showed a reduction in tumor weight and size following oral CE administration. Histochemistry confirmed that CE inhibited tumor growth in the mouse LNCaP xenograft model. The administration of CE had no adverse effects on body weight, behavioral patterns, blood biochemistry, and histopathology findings of vital organs in mice. Finally, a total of 13 phytochemical constituents were identified and quantified in CE. The most abundant secondary metabolites in CE were astragalin, tricin, and p-coumaric acid.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrated the antitumor efficacy of CE against prostate cancer.

Distant metastasis often occurs in advanced PRAD and most patients are dying from it. However, the mechanism of PRAD progression and metastasis is still unclear. It's widely reported that more than 94% of genes are selectively splicing in humans and many isoforms are particularly related with cancer progression and metastasis. Spliceosome mutations occur in a mutually exclusive manner in breast cancer, and different components of spliceosomes are targets of somatic mutations in different types of breast cancer. Existing evidence strongly supports the key role of alternative splicing in breast cancer biology, and innovative tools are being developed to use splicing events for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. In order to identify if the PRAD metastasis is associated with alternative splicing events (ASEs), the RNA sequencing data and ASEs data of 500 PRAD patients were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and TCGASpliceSeq databases. By Lasso regression, five genes were screened to construct the prediction model, with a good reliability by ROC curve. Additionally, results in both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed the well prognosis efficacy of the prediction model (both P < 0.001). Moreover, a potential splicing regulatory network was established and after multiple-database validation, we supposed that the signaling axis of HSPB1 up-regulating the PIP5K1C - 46,721 - AT (P < 0.001) might mediate the tumorigenesis, progression and metastasis of PRAD via the key members of Alzheimer's disease pathway (SRC, EGFR, MAPT, APP and PRKCA) (P < 0.001).""","""['Jiwen Zhu', 'Jiayao Zhang#', 'Peng Hu#', 'Mingxiang Fan', 'Dianwen Song', 'Huabin Yin', 'Penghui Yan', 'Shuyuan Xian', 'Zhenyu Li', 'Juanru Guo', 'Chunling Long', 'Runping Xu', 'Runzhi Huang#', 'Tong Meng', 'Jie Zhang', 'Zongqiang Huang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biochem Genet""","""['Prognostic value and potential function of splicing events in prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of Prognostic and Metastatic Alternative Splicing Signatures in Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma.', 'Identification of Prognostic Biomarkers Associated with Cancer Stem Cell Features in Prostate Adenocarcinoma.', 'Identification of prognostic and metastasis-related alternative splicing signatures in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Exploration of predictive and prognostic alternative splicing signatures in lung adenocarcinoma using machine learning methods.']"""

Nonetheless, the clinical significance of TAM-related biomarkers in prostate cancer (PCa) is largely unexplored. The present study aimed to construct a macrophage-related signature (MRS) for predicting PCa patient prognosis based on macrophage marker genes. Six cohorts comprising 1056 PCa patients with RNA-Seq and follow-up data were enrolled. Based on macrophage marker genes identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis, univariate analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso)-Cox regression, and machine learning procedures were performed to derive a consensus MRS. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), concordance index, and decision curve analyses were used to confirm the predictive capacity of the MRS. The predictive performance of the MRS for recurrence-free survival (RFS) was stable and robust, and the MRS outperformed traditional clinical variables. Furthermore, high-MRS-score patients presented abundant macrophage infiltration and high-expression levels of immune checkpoints (CTLA4, HAVCR2, and CD86). The frequency of mutations was relatively high in the high-MRS-score subgroup. However, the low-MRS-score patients had a better response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and leuprolide-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Notably, abnormal ATF3 expression may be associated with docetaxel and cabazitaxel resistance in PCa cells, T stage, and the Gleason score. In this study, a novel MRS was first developed and validated to accurately predict patient survival outcomes, evaluate immune characteristics, infer therapeutic benefits, and provide an auxiliary tool for personalized therapy.""","""['Xiugai Li', 'Chang Zheng', 'Xiaoxia Xue', 'Junying Wu', 'Fei Li', 'Dan Song', 'Xuelian Li']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Funct Integr Genomics""","""['The novel transcriptomic signature of angiogenesis predicts clinical outcome, tumor microenvironment and treatment response for prostate adenocarcinoma.', 'Comprehensive analysis of scRNA-Seq and bulk RNA-Seq reveals dynamic changes in the tumor immune microenvironment of bladder cancer and establishes a prognostic model.', 'M2-like tumor-associated macrophage-related biomarkers to construct a novel prognostic signature, reveal the immune landscape, and screen drugs in hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Classification of pyroptosis patterns and construction of a novel prognostic model for prostate cancer based on bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing.', 'Multi-omics analysis reveals a macrophage-related marker gene signature for prognostic prediction, immune landscape, genomic heterogeneity, and drug choices in prostate cancer.', 'Comprehensive analysis of single-cell RNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq revealed the heterogeneity and convergence of the immune microenvironment in renal cell carcinoma.']"""

The co-primary outcomes were the first core to detect clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and the first highest ISUP grade group.

Results:   Overall, csPCa was detected in 37% of patients. To reach a csPCa detection rate of 95%, a 3-core strategy was required, except for patients with PI-RADS 5 lesions and those with PSA density ≥ 0.2 ng/ml/cc who benefited from a fourth TB core. At multivariable analysis, only a PSA density ≥ 0.2 ng/ml/cc was an independent predictive factor of having the highest ISUP grade group on the fourth TB cores (p = 0.03). No significant difference in the cancer detection rate was found between cTB and pTB (p = 0.9). Omitting pTB would miss 18% of all csPCa.

Methods:   Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System recommendations underlying clinical prostate scans were used to develop a SPEN-based DWI protocol, which included a novel, local, low-rank regularization algorithm. These DWI acquisitions were run at 3 T under similar nominal spatial resolutions and diffusion-weighting b-values as used in EPI-based clinical studies. Prostates of 11 patients suspected of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions were therefore scanned using the two methods, with the same number of slices, same slice thickness, and same interslice gaps.  Results:   Of the 11 patients scanned, SPEN and EPI provided comparable information in 7 of the cases, whereas EPI was deemed superior in a case for which SPEN images had to be acquired with a shorter effective TR owing to scan-time constraints. SPEN provided reduced susceptibility to field-derived distortions in 3 of the cases.  Conclusions:   SPEN's ability to provide prostate lesion contrast was most clearly evidenced for DW images acquired with b ≥ 900 s/mm2 . SPEN also succeeded in decreasing occasional image distortions in regions close to the rectum, affected by field inhomogeneities.

This phase III trial study aimed to evaluated the efficacy and safety of LY01005 in Chinese patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   We conducted a randomized controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial across 49 sites in China. This study included 290 patients with prostate cancer who received either LY01005 or goserelin implants every 28 days for three injections. The primary efficacy endpoints were the percentage of patients with testosterone suppression ≤50 ng/dL at day 29 and the cumulative probability of testosterone ≤50 ng/dL from day 29 to 85. Non-inferiority was prespecified at a margin of -10%. Secondary endpoints included significant castration (≤20 ng/dL), testosterone surge within 72 h following repeated dosing, and changes in luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and prostate specific antigen levels.  Results:   On day 29, in the LY01005 and goserelin implant groups, testosterone concentrations fell below medical-castration levels in 99.3% (142/143) and 100% (140/140) of patients, respectively, with a difference of -0.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], -3.9% to 2.0%) between the two groups.

Methods:   Enzalutamide-induced candidate markers were derived from single-cell RNA sequencing analysis integrating three enzalutamide-stimulated models (0-, 48-, and 168-h enzalutamide stimulation). ENZ-sig was constructed on the basis of candidate genes that were associated with RFS in The Cancer Genome Atlas leveraging least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. The ENZ-sig was further validated in GSE70768, GSE94767, E-MTAB-6128, DFKZ, GSE21034, and GSE70769 datasets. Biological enrichment analysis was used to discover the underlying mechanism between high ENZ-sig and low ENZ-sig in single-cell RNA sequencing and bulk RNA sequencing.  Results:   We identified a heterogenous subgroup that induced by enzalutamide stimulation and found 53 enzalutamide-induced candidate markers that are related to trajectory progression and enzalutamide-stimulated.

Patients were immobilized in supine position with either ankle or knee rest. Partial bladder filling and rectum emptying protocol was followed. Clinical target volume (CTV) segmentation was done according to EORTC recommendation. Population based PTV expansion from CTV of 10 mm (cranio-caudal), 10 mm (medio-lateral), 10 mm (anterior) and 5 mm (posterior) was given. In patients with radiologically enlarged pelvic lymph node, whole pelvis intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to a dose of 50.4 Gy/28# followed by prostatic boost 26Gy/13# by IMRT using image guidance.

Methods:   Retrospective prostate cancer registry data were used. The SF-6D, AQoL-6D, and EPIC-26 were collected at baseline and one year post treatment. Analyses were based on Spearman's correlation coefficient, Bland-Altman plots and intra-class correlation coefficient, Kruskal Wallis, and Effect Size and the Standardised Response Mean for responsiveness.  Results:   The study sample was comprised of 1915 patients. Complete case analysis of 3,697 observations showed moderate evidence of convergent validity between EPIC-26 vitality/hormonal domain and AQoL-6D (r = 0.45 and 0.54) and SF-6D (r = 0.52 and 0.56) at both timepoints. Vitality/hormonal domain also showed moderate convergent validity with coping domain of AQoL-6D (r = 0.45 and 0.54) and with role (r = 0.41 and 0.49) and social function (r = 0.47 and 0.50) domains of SF-6D at both timepoints, and with independent living (r = 0.40) and mental health (r = 0.43) of AQoL-6D at one year. EPIC-26 sexual domain had moderate convergent validity with relationship domain (r = 0.42 and 0.41) of AQoL-6D at both timepoints. Both AQoL-6D and SF-6D did not discriminate between age groups and tumour stage at both timepoints but AQoL-6D discriminated between outcomes for different treatments at one year. All EPIC-26 domains discriminated between age groups and treatment at both timepoints. The EPIC-26 was more responsive than AQoL-6D and SF-6D between baseline and one year following treatment.  Conclusions:   AQoL-6D can be used in combination with EPIC-26 in place of SF-12. Although EPIC-26 is not utility based, its popularity amongst clinicians and ability to discriminate between disease-specific characteristics and post-treatment outcomes in clinical trials makes it a candidate for use within cost-effectiveness analyses.

Sinularin is a soft coralsderived natural compound that has anticancer activity in many cancer cells. However, the pharmacological action of sinularin in prostate cancer is unclear.  Aim:   The aim of the study is to examine the anticancer effects of sinularin in prostate cancer cells.  Methods:   We explored the anticancer effects of sinularin on the prostate cancer cell lines, PC3, DU145, and LNCaP, by MTT, Transwell assay, wound healing, flow cytometry, and western blotting.  Results:   Sinularin inhibited the cell viability and colony formation of these cancer cells. Furthermore, sinularin inhibited testosterone-induced cell growth in LNCaP cells by downregulating the protein expression levels of androgen receptor (AR), type Ⅱ 5α-reductase, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Sinularin significantly attenuated the invasion and migration ability of PC3 and DU145 cells, with or without TGF-β1 treatment. Sinularin inhibited epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) in DU145 cells after 48 h of treatment by regulating the protein expression levels of Ecadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin. Sinularin induced apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis by regulating the protein expression levels of Beclin-1, LC3B, NRF2, GPX4, PARP, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9, cleaved-PARP, Bcl-2, and Bax. Moreover, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased but glutathione was decreased after sinularin treatment in PC3, DU145 and LNCaP cells.  Conclusion:   Sinularin regulated the androgen receptor signaling pathway and triggered apoptosis, autophagy, and ferroptosis in prostate cancer cells.

However, the efficacy of MPD in treating prostate cancer remains unexplored. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticancer activity and action mechanism of MPD in prostate cancer. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), wound healing, transwell, and flow cytometer assays revealed that MPD suppressed proliferation, migration, cell cycle, and invasion and induced apoptosis of DU145 cells. Mechanistically, MPD decreased cholesterol concentration in the cholesterol oxidase, peroxidase and 4-aminoantipyrine phenol (COD-PAP) assay, disrupting the lipid rafts as detected using immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses after sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Further, it reduced the associated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway protein P-extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK), detected using immunoblot analysis. Forkhead box O (FOXO)1, a tumor suppressor and critical factor controlling cholesterol metabolism, was predicted to be a direct target of MPD and induced by MPD. Notably, in vivo studies demonstrated that MPD significantly reduced tumor size, suppressed cholesterol concentration and the MAPK signaling pathway, and induced FOXO1 expression and apoptosis in tumor tissue in a subcutaneous mouse model. These results suggest that MPD displays anti-prostate cancer activity by inducing FOXO1 protein, reducing cholesterol concentration, and disrupting lipid rafts. Consequently, the reduced MAPK signaling pathway suppresses proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle and induces apoptosis of prostate cancer cells.""","""['Jie Chen', 'Puyan Qin', 'Zhanxia Tao', 'Weijian Ding', 'Yunlong Yao', 'Weifang Xu', 'Dengke Yin', 'Song Tan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biol Pharm Bull""","""['Methyl Protodioscin Induces Apoptosis in Human Osteosarcoma Cells by Caspase-Dependent and MAPK Signaling Pathways.', 'Chinese medicinal compound CFF-1 induces the apoptosis and cycle-arrest of prostate cancer cells via the PI3K/AKT/FOXO1 signaling pathway.', 'Sea cucumber extract TBL-12 inhibits the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human prostate cancer cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and intrinsic caspase apoptosis pathway.', 'Interplay Among PI3K/AKT, PTEN/FOXO and AR Signaling in Prostate Cancer.', 'Signaling pathway of MAPK/ERK in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, senescence and apoptosis.']"""

Times from diagnosis to treatment were compared according to the most frequent tumor sites between 2020 and the other study years. Between 2018 and 2021, a total of 29,796 new cases were treated at the center including 24,891 with a single tumor and 4,905 with multiple tumors, including nonmelanoma skin cancer. The number of new cases decreased by 25% between 2018 and 2020 and 22% between 2019 and 2020, followed by an increase of about 22% in 2021. Clinical stages differed across years, with the number of new advanced cases decreasing from 17.8% in 2018 to 15.2% in 2020.

Materials and methods:   Forty-one men (median age: 67.7 years) from a prior prospective VERDICT study (April 2016-October 2017) were analysed retrospectively. Men who were suspected of prostate cancer and scanned twice using VERDICT were included.

Three anatomical locations were analysed per subject: normal TZ (transition zone), normal PZ (peripheral zone), and index lesions. Repeated measures ANOVAs showed which b-value range had the lowest wSD, Spearman correlation and generalized linear model regression analysis determined whether wSD was related to ADC magnitude and ROI size.  Results:   The mean lesion ADC for b0b1500 had the lowest wSD in most zones (0.18-0.58x10-4 mm2/s). The wSD was unaffected by ADC magnitude (Lesion: p = 0.064, TZ: p = 0.368, PZ: p = 0.072) and lesion Likert score (p = 0.95). wSD showed a decrease with ROI size pooled over zones (p = 0.019, adjusted regression coefficient = -1.6x10-3, larger ROIs for TZ versus PZ versus lesions).

A greater understanding of the genomic features that determine extent and location of metastatic spread may inform risk stratification and monitoring. Here, we identify genomic alterations from primary prostate carcinomas that are predictive of wide-spread metastatic potential.  Methods:   Genomic and clinical data from 1,312 patients with primary prostate carcinoma were extracted from the MSK-MET cohort through cBioPortal. Metastatic site counts and overall survival (OS) data were publicly available and used as the primary outcomes. Primary tumor samples were profiled using the MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing platform. We focused on 58 genes frequently altered in prostate cancer. Cox proportional hazard analyses defined hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall mortality in patients with different metastatic outcomes.  Results:   Out of the 1,312 patients in our cohort, 939 (71%) developed metastases, of whom 113 (8.6%) had metastases to 5 or more distinct anatomical sites (defining wide-spread metastases, WSM). Bone was the most common site of metastasis (36%), and 80% of patients with liver metastases had 4 or more additional sites of metastasis. Among patients with metastasis, increasing number of metastatic sites was associated with increased risk of death (HR: 1.8, 95%CI: 1.63-1.99, P < 0.001).

In the current study we investigated the association between SPC risks and characteristics of applied external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) protocols for localized prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   We collected EBRT protocol characteristics (2000-2016) from five Dutch RT institutes for the 3D-CRT and advanced EBRT era (N = 7908). From the Netherlands Cancer Registry we obtained patient/tumour characteristics, SPC data, and survival information. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for pelvis and non-pelvis SPC. Nationwide SIRs were calculated as a reference, using calendar period as a proxy to label 3D-CRT/advanced EBRT.  Results:   From 2000-2006, 3D-CRT with 68-78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, delivered with 10-23 MV and weekly portal imaging was the most dominant protocol. By the year 2010 all institutes routinely used advanced EBRT (IMRT, VMAT, tomotherapy), mainly delivering 78 Gy in 2 Gy fractions, using various kV/MV imaging protocols. Sixteen percent (N = 1268) developed ≥ 1 SPC. SIRs for pelvis and non-pelvis SPC (all institutes, advanced EBRT vs 3D-CRT) were 1.17 (1.00-1.36) vs 1.39 (1.21-1.59), and 1.01 (0.89-1.07) vs 1.03 (0.94-1.13), respectively.

For this purpose, first we designed a suitable nanocarrier using a novel Zn:MnO2 nanocomposite (NCs) and gallic acid (GA)-polylactic acid (PLA)-Alginate polymeric shell with nanoscale particle size and good stability. Chemical statements, morphology, and physicochemical properties of the nanocarrier have been illuminated with advanced characterization techniques. According to the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, Zn:MnO2 NCs had a spherical and monodispersed morphology with a 2.03 ± 0.67 nm diameter. Moreover, vibrating-sample magnetometer (VSM) results showed that Zn:MnO2 had paramagnetic properties with a saturation magnetization (Ms) value of 1.136 emu/g. Additionally, the in-vitro cytotoxic effects of the single and binary drugs loaded Zn:MnO2-doped polymeric nanocarriers against PC-3 prostate cancer cells were investigated. According to the results, there was no significant cytotoxic effect of free BA and Cer against PC-3 prostate cancer cells.

Consequently, BA-Cer/Zn:MnO2@GA-PLA-Alginate is a nanocarrier with good stability, enhanced drug loading and release capacity for hydrophobic drugs, as well as being used as both imaging and treatment agent due to its magnetic properties.

The role of NAPE-PLD in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions is currently under investigation. For example, the enzyme might be involved in the control of neuronal activity, embryonic development and pregnancy, and prostate cancer. We synthesized a novel NAPE-PLD substrate with a fluorogenic pyrene substituent at the N-acyl residue as tool compound for studying this enzyme. As shown by HPLC with fluorescence detection, in rat brain microsomes the substrate was transformed into the expected pyrene-labeled N-acylethanolamine (NAE), but minor amounts of three by-products could also be detected.

However, due to the large variability of medical images, accurate segmentation is a highly challenging task. In this paper, we present a novel medical image segmentation network named the Multiple Feature Association Network (MFA-Net), which is based on deep learning techniques. The MFA-Net utilizes an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections as its backbone network, and a parallelly dilated convolutions arrangement (PDCA) module is integrated between the encoder and the decoder to capture more representative deep features. Furthermore, a multi-scale feature restructuring module (MFRM) is introduced to restructure and fuse the deep features of the encoder. To enhance global attention perception, the proposed global attention stacking (GAS) modules are cascaded on the decoder. The proposed MFA-Net leverages novel global attention mechanisms to improve the segmentation performance at different feature scales. We evaluated our MFA-Net on four segmentation tasks, including lesions in intestinal polyp, liver tumor, prostate cancer, and skin lesion. Our experimental results and ablation study demonstrate that the proposed MFA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of global positioning and local edge recognition.""","""['Zhixun Li', 'Nan Zhang', 'Huiling Gong', 'Ruiyun Qiu', 'Wei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['HMA-Net: A deep U-shaped network combined with HarDNet and multi-attention mechanism for medical image segmentation.', 'PolypSegNet: A modified encoder-decoder architecture for automated polyp segmentation from colonoscopy images.', 'Feature-guided attention network for medical image segmentation.', 'ACCPG-Net: A skin lesion segmentation network with Adaptive Channel-Context-Aware Pyramid Attention and Global Feature Fusion.', 'EIU-Net: Enhanced feature extraction and improved skip connections in U-Net for skin lesion segmentation.']"""

A biopsy may be done when a blood test shows a high level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) or after a digital rectal examination finds an abnormal prostate or a lump. Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guided biopsy is a commonly performed procedure for the detection of prostate cancer. It is associated with serious complication like urosepsis. Although the incidence of post-TRUS urosepsis is low, when it occurs it is typically serious and leads to hospitalization. Antibiotics are used prior, during and after the procedure to prevent infections as a result of TRUS biopsy. Ciprofloxacin is being used as antibiotic of choice for a long time. Antibiotic prophylaxis may prevent such complications. This cross-sectional descriptive type of observational study was taken place in Dhaka Medical College Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2010 to December 2011 among purposively selected 70 patients with an aim to determine the urosepsis and bacteriuria after TRUS guided prostate biopsy. Patients attending the Urology OPD in DMCH having of LUTS and other non-specific symptoms were evaluated by history, physical examination including digital rectal examination (DRE) and necessary investigations like serum PSA to identify the potential candidates. Patients with abnormal DRE findings and increased PSA level were included in this study and those who had any painful anal and rectal condition, bleeding diathesis, anticoagulant therapy and any known allergy to lidocaine, previously undergone prostrate biopsy and those who refused to give the informed consent were excluded from this study. Data were collected on variables of interest using a structured case record form. Data were processed and analyzed using Statistical package for social science (SPSS), version 17.0. Frequency of bacteriuria and urosepsis was measured according to urine and blood culture report. Sensitivity pattern was also seen. According to this study, the frequency of bacteriuria and urosepsis was 17.1% and 5.7% respectively. Most common uropathogen was E coli both in urine and blood culture. Organisms (100.0%) were found resistant to ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin. Most of the pathogens were sensitive to tobramycin, gentamycin and cefipime. A potentially dangerous ciprofloxacin resistant organism (ESBL producing E. coli) was found positive in 25.0% of culture positive patients.""","""['M A Islam', 'S M Alam', 'A M Reza']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mymensingh Med J""","""['Extended-spectrum β-lactamase in the rectal flora of patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy: a study of the prevalence in a major metropolitan hospital.', 'The prevalence of urinary tract infection, or urosepsis following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in a subset of the Saudi population and patterns of susceptibility to flouroquinolones.', 'Transrectal povidone-iodine efficiency in reducing infections occurring after transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate.', 'Prevalence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in the intestinal flora of patients undergoing transrectal prostate biopsy in Norwich, UK.', 'Evaluation of prostate specific antigen density and transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies in 100 consecutive patients with a negative digital rectal examination and intermediate serum prostate specific antigen levels.']"""

Repetitive exposures with even low doses have been shown to impact adult neurogenesis and induce neuroinflammation. We address the question whether the out-of-field doses during radiotherapy of common tumour entities may pose a risk for the neuronal stem cell compartment in the hippocampus.  Methods:   The dose to the hippocampus was determined for a single fraction according to different treatment plans for the selected tumor entities: Point dose measurements were performed in an anthropomorphic Alderson phantom and the out-of-field dose to the hippocampus was measured using thermoluminescence dosimeters.  Results:   For carcinomas in the head and neck region the dose exposure to the hippocampal region for a single fraction ranged from to 37.4 to 154.8 mGy. The hippocampal dose was clearly different for naso-, oro- and hypopharynx, with maximal values for nasopharynx carcinoma. In contrast, hippocampal dose levels for breast and prostate cancer ranged between 2.7 and 4.1 mGy, and therefore significantly exceeded the background irradiation level.  Conclusion:   The mean dose to hippocampus for treatment of carcinomas in the head and neck region is high enough to reduce neurocognitive functions. In addition, care must be taken regarding the out of field doses. The mean dose is mainly related to scattering effects, as is confirmed by the data from breast or prostate treatments, with a very different geometrical set-up but similar dosimetric results.""","""['Hendrik Auerbach', 'Yvonne Dzierma', 'Michaela Schürmann', 'Christian Rübe', 'Claudia E Rübe']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Characterization of MOSFET dosimeters for low-dose measurements in maxillofacial anthropomorphic phantoms.', 'Out-of-field contributions for IMRT and volumetric modulated arc therapy measured using gafchromic films and compared to calculations using a superposition/convolution based treatment planning system.', 'Dosimetric verification of surface and superficial doses for head and neck IMRT with different PTV shrinkage margins.', 'Evaluation of surface and superficial dose for head and neck treatments using conventional or intensity-modulated techniques.', 'Out-of-field doses in pediatric craniospinal irradiations with 3D-CRT, VMAT, and scanning proton radiotherapy: A phantom study.']"""

Methods:   Fifty patients with prostate cancer (stages IIb-IVb) under ADT were randomized to a 16-week WF program plus usual care (n=25) or usual care control group (n=25). The WF program consisted of three 90-minute sessions per week. Recruitment, withdrawal, adherence, enjoyment rate, and safety of the intervention were recorded throughout the study. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed before and after the interventions, while handgrip strength, lower limb muscle strength, static balance, and QoL were assessed before, during (week 8), and after (week 16) the interventions. Adverse events during sessions were also recorded.  Results:   The WF group showed high levels of adherence (81.6 ± 15.9%) and enjoyment rate (4.5 ± 0.5 out of 5 points). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the WF group showed an improvement in chair sit-to-stand (p=0.035) compared to the control group. Within-group comparisons showed that handgrip strength in the dominant upper limb (p=0.024), maximal isometric muscle strength in the non-dominant lower limb (p=0.006), and balance in the dominant limb (p=0.009) improved over time in the WF group but not in the usual care group. The results obtained from the per-protocol analysis indicate that CRF improved significantly in the WF group as compared to the control group (p=0.035). Within-group analysis revealed that CRF (p=0.036), muscle strength in dominant (p=0.006) and non-dominant (p=0.001) lower limbs, and balance in the non-dominant lower limb (p=0.023) improved after 16 weeks of WF, but not in the control group. One major traumatic injury (muscle tear) was reported with a complete recovery before the end of the intervention.  Conclusion:   This study suggests that WF is feasible, safe, and enjoyable in patients with prostate cancer under hormonal therapy.

The SWE value of 504 cores measured before biopsy and the pathology result of each core were used in the statistical analysis. The SWE values of benign and malignant cores were compared according to pathology results. ROC analysis was used to calculate the best cut-off SWE value for differentiating malignancy from benign tissues. Specificity, sensitivity, negative, and positive predictive values (NPV, PPV) were also calculated for cut-off value.  Results:   Prostate cancer was detected in 74 (14.7%) of 504 core biopsies. The mean SWE values were found significantly higher in malignant cores (71.1 kPa) than benign cores (42.3 kPa) (p < 0.001). Cores with gleason score 7 had a significantly higher SWE value than Gleason score 6 (p = 0.009). The cut-off value to differentiate malignancy and area-under-curve were calculated 35.85 kPa, 0.733, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were 83%, 49%, 78%, and 95%, respectively for 35.85 kPa value.  Conclusions:   The malignant tissues have significantly higher SWE values.

In RCC, although cytoreductive nephrectomy is common, approximately 20-30% of patients will develop recurrent cancer after surgery, which highlights the need for an effective therapy. Rho-GTPases viz, Rac-1 and Cdc42 are the central regulators of cancer cell migration and invasion and thus metastasis in multiple cancer types. Hence, we elucidated the role of Ketorolac, a modulator Rho-GTPases against RCC through potentiation of tumor suppressor Par-4. The effect of Ketorolac alone and in combination on proliferation, apoptosis, cell-cycle progression, migration, tumor inhibition and their related markers were studied. Moreover, Ketorolac's impact on metastasis by influencing Rac-1/HIF-1α/DDX3/β-catenin signalling was studied with respect to its ability to modulate the expression of tumor suppressor Par-4, and this mechanism was confirmed by siRNA knockdown studies. Ketorolac induced cytotoxicity in a panel of renal cells including patient derived tumor cells with IC50 2.8 to 9.02 mM and 0.28 to 3.8 mM in monolayer and anchorage independent clonogenic assays respectively. Ketorolac caused significant down regulation of proliferation (Ki-67, Cyclin D1, pRB and DDX3), migration/invasion (Rac-1, Cdc42, and Tiam1), and angiogenesis (HIF-1α and VEGF) markers as studied by gene and protein expression. Moreover, it caused a significant upregulation of tumor suppressor Par-4 known to be downregulated in RCC. This mechanism was further confirmed by using siRNA knockdown studies where we could demonstrate a negative relation between the expression of Par-4 and Rac-1/Cdc42. Importantly, Ketorolac alone and in combination with Sunitinib showed tumor growth inhibition (TGI) of 73% and 86% respectively in xenograft model. This anti-tumor activity was further corroborated by down regulation of Rac-1/Cdc42/HIF-1α/DDX3/β-catenin signalling. This is the first report which implicates the role of Ketorolac against RCC by acting as a small molecule secretagogue causing upregulation of Par-4 in autocrine and paracrine manner. Consequently, these findings suggest that Par-4 can serve as a valuable therapeutic target and a prognostic marker for the treatment of RCC.""","""['Vinay Sonawane#', 'Jeevan Ghosalkar#', 'Swati Achrekar', 'Kalpana Joshi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Renal cancer cells lacking hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha expression maintain vascular endothelial growth factor expression through HIF-2alpha.', 'LncRNA HOTAIR regulates HIF-1α/AXL signaling through inhibition of miR-217 in renal cell carcinoma.', 'Prolyl hydroxylase 2 dependent and Von-Hippel-Lindau independent degradation of Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and 2 alpha by selenium in clear cell renal cell carcinoma leads to tumor growth inhibition.', 'TGFBI-promoted adhesion, migration and invasion of human renal cell carcinoma depends on inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor.', 'Hypoxia, Hypoxia-inducible Transcription Factors, and Renal Cancer.']"""

We analyzed the disease-free survival (DFS) of BCa in patients with PCa who underwent brachytherapy with or without EBRT. We performed multivariate Cox regression analyses of DFS using age, EBRT, and Brinkman index (BI) score (number of cigarettes smoked per day × number of years smoking) ≥ 200 as variables for BCa after brachytherapy.  Results:   Fourteen patients (2.4%) developed BCa after brachytherapy with or without EBRT. The percentage of high-grade urothelial carcinoma (UC) was 63.6%. A total of 85.7% of patients had non-muscle invasive BCa, and 14.3% of patients had muscle invasive BCa.

Evaluation of quantitative variability and establishment of reference standards are important for optimal clinical and research utility. This work evaluates the variability of PSMA-based [18F]DCFPyL (PyL) PET quantitative reference standards. Consecutive eligible patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer were recruited for study participation from August 2016-October 2017. After PyL tracer injection, whole body PET/CT (wbPET/CT) was obtained with subsequent whole body PET/MR (wbPET/MR). Two readers independently created regions of interest (ROIs) including a 40% standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold ROI of the whole right parotid gland and separate spherical ROIs in the superior, mid, and inferior gland. Additional liver (right lobe) and blood pool spherical ROIs were defined. Bland-Altman analysis, including limits of agreement (LOA), as well as interquartile range (IQR) and coefficient of variance (CoV) was used. Twelve patients with prostate cancer were recruited (mean age, 61.8 yrs; range 54-72 years). One patient did not have wbPET/MR and was excluded. There was minimal inter-reader SUVmean variability (bias±LOA) for blood pool (-0.13±0.42; 0.01±0.41), liver (-0.55±0.82; -0.22±1.3), or whole parotid gland (-0.05±0.31; 0.08±0.24) for wbPET/CT and wbPET/MR, respectively. Greater inter-reader variability for the 1-cm parotid gland ROIs was present, for both wbPET/CT and wbPET/MR. Comparing wbPET/CT to the subsequently acquired wbPET/MR, blood pool had a slight decrease in SUVmean.

Pre- and postprocedural MRI is not routinely performed for LUTS due to BPH treatments. However, because of the combination of rapidly evolving treatments available for LUTS due to BPH and increasing demand for prebiopsy prostate MRI for detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (PCa), an understanding of procedural techniques and expected changes are important for accurate interpretation of prostate MRI performed after treatment of BPH. The authors discuss the imaging evaluation of LUTS due to BPH and emerging predictors of treatment success. The posttreatment appearance and underlying anatomic changes in the prostate after medical, surgical, and minimally invasive treatments including TURP, simple prostatectomy, laser enucleations and ablations, prostatic urethral lift, water vapor thermal therapy, and prostate artery embolization are detailed. Most procedures reduce prostate volume, notably in the periurethral prostatic tissue. Ablations create areas of necrosis and can distort the normal zonal anatomy between the transition zone and the peripheral zone, and prostate artery embolization creates infarcts in the transition zone. Mechanical prostatic urethral lift devices open the anterior channel at the bladder base but create susceptibility artifacts that can obscure and prevent detection of a lesion in the transition zone. Also discussed are the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in the postprocedural prostate and imaging of BPH procedure complications such as urethral strictures, abscesses, and hematuria. ©RSNA, 2023 Quiz questions for this article are available in the supplemental material.

However, navigation to biopsy targets remains challenging due to the limitations of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance added to prostate motion issues. This article describes a rigid 2D/3D deep registration method, which provides a continuous tracking of the biopsy location w.r.t the prostate for enhanced navigation.  Methods:   A spatiotemporal registration network (SpT-Net) is proposed to localize the live 2D US image relatively to a previously aquired US reference volume. The temporal context relies on prior trajectory information based on previous registration results and probe tracking. Different forms of spatial context were compared through inputs (local, partial or global) or using an additional spatial penalty term. The proposed 3D CNN architecture with all combinations of spatial and temporal context was evaluated in an ablation study. For providing a realistic clinical validation, a cumulative error was computed through series of registrations along trajectories, simulating a complete clinical navigation procedure. We also proposed two dataset generation processes with increasing levels of registration complexity and clinical realism.  Results:   The experiments show that a model using local spatial information combined with temporal information performs better than more complex spatiotemporal combination.  Conclusion:   The best proposed model demonstrates robust real-time 2D/3D US cumulated registration performance on trajectories. Those results respect clinical requirements, application feasibility, and they outperform similar state-of-the-art methods.

Objective:   To determine in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer whether the addition of MDT to intermittent hormone therapy improves oncologic outcomes and preserves time with eugonadal testosterone compared with intermittent hormone therapy alone.  Design, setting, participants:   The External Beam Radiation to Eliminate Nominal Metastatic Disease (EXTEND) trial is a phase 2, basket randomized clinical trial for multiple solid tumors testing the addition of MDT to standard-of-care systemic therapy. Men aged 18 years or older with oligometastatic prostate cancer who had 5 or fewer metastases and were treated with hormone therapy for 2 or more months were enrolled to the prostate intermittent hormone therapy basket at multicenter tertiary cancer centers from September 2018 to November 2020. The cutoff date for the primary analysis was January 7, 2022.  Interventions:   Patients were randomized 1:1 to MDT, consisting of definitive radiation therapy to all sites of disease and intermittent hormone therapy (combined therapy arm; n = 43) or to hormone therapy only (n = 44). A planned break in hormone therapy occurred 6 months after enrollment, after which hormone therapy was withheld until progression.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was disease progression, defined as death or radiographic, clinical, or biochemical progression. A key predefined secondary end point was eugonadal progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from achieving a eugonadal testosterone level (≥150 ng/dL; to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.0347) until progression. Exploratory measures included quality of life and systemic immune evaluation using flow cytometry and T-cell receptor sequencing.  Results:   The study included 87 men (median age, 67 years [IQR, 63-72 years]). Median follow-up was 22.0 months (range, 11.6-39.2 months). Progression-free survival was improved in the combined therapy arm (median not reached) compared with the hormone therapy only arm (median, 15.8 months; 95% CI, 13.6-21.2 months) (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.55; P < .001). Eugonadal PFS was also improved with MDT (median not reached) compared with the hormone therapy only (6.1 months; 95% CI, 3.7 months to not estimable) (hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.11-0.91; P = .03). Flow cytometry and T-cell receptor sequencing demonstrated increased markers of T-cell activation, proliferation, and clonal expansion limited to the combined therapy arm.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial, PFS and eugonadal PFS were significantly improved with combination treatment compared with hormone treatment only in men with oligometastatic prostate cancer. Combination of MDT with intermittent hormone therapy may allow for excellent disease control while facilitating prolonged eugonadal testosterone intervals.

The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) provides health behaviour recommendations for people LWBC, and there is some evidence linking adherence to these with improved QoL.  Methods:   Adults LWBC (specifically breast, colorectal or prostate cancer) completed a survey covering health behaviours (diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking), fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue Scale, version 4) and a broad measure of QoL (EQ-5D-5L descriptive scale). Participants were categorised as meeting/not meeting WCRF recommendations, using the following cut-offs classified as meeting the guidelines: ≥150 min physical activity/week, fruit and vegetables (≥5 portions/day), fibre (≥30 g fibre per day), free sugar (<5% of total calories from free sugar), fat (<33% total energy), red meat (<500 g/week), processed meat (none), alcohol consumption (<14 units/week) and not a current smoker. Logistic regression analyses explored associations between WCRF adherence and fatigue and QoL issues, controlling for demographic and clinical variables.  Results:   Among 5835 individuals LWBC (mean age: 67 years, 56% female, 90% white, breast 48%, prostate 32% and colorectal 21%), 22% had severe fatigue and 72% had 1+ issue/s on the EQ-5D-5L.

Adhering to physical activity guidelines (OR = 0.71, CI = 0.62-0.82) was also associated with decreased odds of having 1+ QoL issue/s.  Conclusions:   Adherence to various WCRF recommendations, particularly the recommendation for physical activity, was associated with less fatigue and better QoL in a large UK cohort of people living with and beyond breast, colorectal or prostate cancer.

Recently, it has been identified as a putative biomarker of prostate, gastric, and lung cancer stem cell phenotype. Although ALDH3A1 has multifaceted functions in both normal and cancer homeostasis, its modes of action are currently unknown. To this end, we utilized a random 12-mer peptide phage display library to identify efficiently human ALDH3A1-interacting peptides. One prevailing peptide (P1) was systematically demonstrated to interact with the protein of interest, which was further validated in vitro by peptide ELISA. Bioinformatic analysis indicated two putative P1 binding sites on the protein surface implying biomedical potential and potent inhibitory activity of the P1 peptide on hALDH3A1 activity was demonstrated by enzymatic studies. Furthermore, in search of potential hALDH3A1 interacting players, a BLASTp search demonstrated that no protein in the database includes the full-length amino acid sequence of P1, but identified a list of proteins containing parts of the P1 sequence, which may prove potential hALDH3A1 interacting partners. Among them, Protein Kinase C Binding Protein 1 and General Transcription Factor II-I are candidates of high interest due to their cellular localization and function.

Current recommendations advocate the use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), which is composed of three sequences: T2-weighted sequence (T2W), diffusion-weighted sequence (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequence (DCE). Prior studies suggest that a biparametric MRI (bpMRI) approach, omitting the DCE sequences, may not compromise clinically significant cancer detection, though there are limitations to these studies, and it is not known how this may affect treatment eligibility. A bpMRI approach will reduce scanning time, may be more cost-effective and, at a population level, will allow more men to gain access to an MRI than an mpMRI approach.  Methods:   Prostate Imaging Using MRI±Contrast Enhancement (PRIME) is a prospective, international, multicentre, within-patient diagnostic yield trial assessing whether bpMRI is non-inferior to mpMRI in the diagnosis of clinically significant PCa. Patients will undergo the full mpMRI scan. Radiologists will be blinded to the DCE and will initially report the MRI using only the bpMRI (T2W and DWI) sequences. They will then be unblinded to the DCE sequence and will then re-report the MRI using the mpMRI sequences (T2W, DWI and DCE). Men with suspicious lesions on either bpMRI or mpMRI will undergo prostate biopsy. The main inclusion criteria are men with suspected PCa, with a serum PSA of ≤20 ng/mL and without prior prostate biopsy. The primary outcome is the proportion of men with clinically significant PCa detected (Gleason score ≥3+4 or Gleason grade group ≥2). A sample size of at least 500 patients is required. Key secondary outcomes include the proportion of clinically insignificant PCa detected and treatment decision.

Mechanistically, we demonstrated that isobavachin can disrupt the nuclear translocation of AR and promote its proteasomal degradation. The results of computer simulations showed that isobavachin can stably bind to AR, and the amino acid residue Gln711 may play a critical role in AR binding of both AR agonists and antagonists.

To obtain the high sensitivity and reproducibility of the ECL MMbiosensors, a series of strategies have been developed including replacing a conventional photomultiplier tube (PMT) with a diamagnetic PMT, replacing the stacked ring-disc magnets with circular-disc magnets lain-in glassy carbon electrode, adding a pre-concentration process of MBs using external magnet actuation. For fundamental research, the ECL MBs taken as the substitute of ECL MMbiosensors were prepared by binding biotinylated DNA tagged with Ru(bpy)32+ derivative (Ru1) to streptavidin-coated MB(MB@SA) were which showed that the developed strategies can enhance 45-fold sensitivity. Importantly, the developed MBs-based ECL platform was estimated by determination of prostate specific antigen (PSA) and exosomes. For PSA, MB@SA•biotin-Ab1(PSA) was taken as the capture probe and Ru1-labeled Ab2 (PSA) was done as ECL probe, while for exosomes, MB@SA•biotin-aptamer (CD63) was taken as the capture probe and Ru1-labeled Ab (CD9) was done as the ECL probe. The experiment results showed that the developed strategies can enhance 33-fold sensitivity of ECL MMbiosensors for PSA and exosomes. The detection limit is 0.28 ng mL-1 for PSA and 4.9 × 102 particle mL-1 for exosomes.

This approach, could be led to the loss of considerable information and some challenges of direct targeting. To avoid these problems, we analyzed the rewiring network and constructed two miRNA-mRNA expression bipartite networks for both normal and primary prostate cancer tissue obtained from PRAD-TCGA. We then calculated beta-coefficient of the regression-model when miR was dependent and mRNA independent for each miR and mRNA and separately in both networks. We defined the rewired edges as a significant change in the regression coefficient between normal and cancer states. The rewired nodes through multinomial distribution were defined and network from rewired edges and nodes was analyzed and enriched. Of the 306 rewired edges, 112(37%) were new, 123(40%) were lost, 44(14%) were strengthened, and 27(9%) weakened connections were discovered.

However, spatial cumulant models (SCMs), which have arisen from theoretical ecology, describe population dynamics generated by a specific family of IBMs, namely spatio-temporal point processes (STPPs). SCMs are spatially resolved population models formulated by a system of differential equations that approximate the dynamics of two STPP-generated summary statistics: first-order spatial cumulants (densities), and second-order spatial cumulants (spatial covariances). We exemplify how SCMs can be used in mathematical oncology by modelling theoretical cancer cell populations comprising interacting growth factor-producing and non-producing cells. To formulate model equations, we use computational tools that enable the generation of STPPs, SCMs and mean-field population models (MFPMs) from user-defined model descriptions (Cornell et al. Nat Commun 10:4716, 2019). To calculate and compare STPP, SCM and MFPM-generated summary statistics, we develop an application-agnostic computational pipeline. Our results demonstrate that SCMs can capture STPP-generated population density dynamics, even when MFPMs fail to do so. From both MFPM and SCM equations, we derive treatment-induced death rates required to achieve non-growing cell populations. When testing these treatment strategies in STPP-generated cell populations, our results demonstrate that SCM-informed strategies outperform MFPM-informed strategies in terms of inhibiting population growths. We thus demonstrate that SCMs provide a new framework in which to study cell-cell interactions, and can be used to describe and perturb STPP-generated cell population dynamics. We, therefore, argue that SCMs can be used to increase IBMs' applicability in cancer research.""","""['Sara Hamis', 'Panu Somervuo', 'J Arvid Ågren', 'Dagim Shiferaw Tadele', 'Juha Kesseli', 'Jacob G Scott', 'Matti Nykter', 'Philip Gerlee', 'Dmitri Finkelshtein', 'Otso Ovaskainen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Math Biol""","""['A unified framework for analysis of individual-based models in ecology and beyond.', 'Spatial point processes and moment dynamics in the life sciences: a parsimonious derivation and some extensions.', 'Macromolecular crowding: chemistry and physics meet biology (Ascona, Switzerland, 10-14 June 2012).', 'Population and evolutionary dynamics in spatially structured seasonally varying environments.', 'Methods of aggregation of variables in population dynamics.']"""

Based on one to 7 years of follow-up (prostate specific antigen [PSA] level≥0.2 ng/mL, indicative of prostate carcinoma-biochemical recurrence), the patients were divided into biochemical recurrence group (n = 77) and normal group (n = 129). The training and testing sets were formed by dividing the patients at a 7:3 ratio. In training set, The magnetic resonance perfusion-weighted imaging-based radiomics radscore was generated using lasso regression. Several predictive models were built based on the patients' clinical imaging data. The predictive efficacy (area under the curve) of these models was compared using the MedCalc software. The decision curve analysis was conducted using the R to compare the net benefit. Finally, an external validation was carried out on the testing set, and the nomogram tool was developed for predicting prostate carcinoma-biochemical recurrence.  Result:   The univariate analysis confirmed that Tumor diameter, tumor node metastasis classification stage of tumor, lymph node metastasis or distance metastasis, Gleason grade, preoperative PSA, ultrasound (peak intensity, arrival time, and elastography grade), and magnetic resonance imaging-radscore1/2 were predictors of prostate carcinoma-biochemical recurrence. On the training set, the combined model based on the above factors had the highest predictive efficacy for prostate carcinoma-biochemical recurrence (area under the curve: 0.91; odds ratio 0.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.85-0.95).

The aim of this study is to develop a convolutional neural networks-based framework for fully-automated detection and segmentation of metastatic prostate cancer lesions in whole-body PET/CT images.  Methods:   525 whole-body PET/CT images of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were available for the study, acquired with the [18F]DCFPyL radiotracer that targets prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). U-Net (1)-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to identify lesions on paired axial PET/CT slices. Baseline models were trained using batch-wise dice loss, as well as the proposed weighted batch-wise dice loss (wDice), and the lesion detection performance was quantified, with a particular emphasis on lesion size, intensity, and location. We used 418 images for model training, 30 for model validation, and 77 for model testing. In addition, we allowed our model to take n = 0,2, …, 12 neighboring axial slices to examine how incorporating greater amounts of 3D context influences model performance. We selected the optimal number of neighboring axial slices that maximized the detection rate on the 30 validation images, and trained five neural networks with different architectures.  Results:   Model performance was evaluated using the detection rate, Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and sensitivity. We found that the proposed wDice loss significantly improved the lesion detection rate, lesion-wise DSC and lesion-wise sensitivity compared to the baseline, with corresponding average increases of 0.07 (p-value = 0.01), 0.03 (p-value = 0.01) and 0.04 (p-value = 0.01), respectively. The inclusion of the first two neighboring axial slices in the input likewise increased the detection rate by 0.17, lesion-wise DSC by 0.05, and lesion-wise mean sensitivity by 0.16. However, there was a minimal effect from including more distant neighboring slices. We ultimately chose to use a number of neighboring slices equal to 2 and the wDice loss function to train our final model. To evaluate the model's performance, we trained three models using identical hyperparameters on three different data splits. The results showed that, on average, the model was able to detect 80% of all testing lesions, with a detection rate of 93% for lesions with maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) greater than 5.0. In addition, the average median lesion-wise DSC was 0.51 and 0.60 for all the lesions and lesions with SUVmax>5.0, respectively, on the testing set. Four additional neural networks with different architectures were trained, and they both yielded stronger performance of segmenting lesions whose SUVmax>5.0 compared to the rest of lesions.  Conclusion:   Our results demonstrate that prostate cancer metastases in PSMA PET/CT images can be detected and segmented using CNNs. The segmentation performance strongly depends on the intensity, size, and the location of lesions, and can be improved by using specialized loss functions. Specifically, the models performed best in detection of lesions with SUVmax>5.0. Another challenge was to accurately segment lesions close to the bladder. Future work will focus on improving the detection of lesions with lower SUV values by designing custom loss functions that take into account the lesion intensity, using additional data augmentation techniques, and reducing the number of false lesions by developing methods to better separate signal from noise.""","""['Yixi Xu', 'Ivan Klyuzhin', 'Sara Harsini', 'Anthony Ortiz', 'Shun Zhang', 'François Bénard', 'Rahul Dodhia', 'Carlos F Uribe', 'Arman Rahmim', 'Juan Lavista Ferres']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Comput Biol Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Fully automatic prognostic biomarker extraction from metastatic prostate lesion segmentations in whole-body 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT images.', 'Efficacy of early imaging with 68Ga-PSMA-I&T in the discrimination of pelvic lesions in prostate cancer patients.', 'Investigation and benchmarking of U-Nets on prostate segmentation tasks.', 'Tooth automatic segmentation from CBCT images: a systematic review.']"""

While androgen deprivation therapy is efficacious in castration-sensitive prostate cancer, it remains less effective in castration-resistant cases. Transcriptional dysregulation is a well-established hallmark of cancer, and targeting proteins involved in transcriptional regulation, such as cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), has become an attractive therapeutic strategy. CDK8, a nuclear serine-threonine kinase, is a key component of the mediator complex and plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have highlighted the promising role of CDK8 as a target in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Our study assessed the efficacy of a novel CDK8 inhibitor, E966-0530-45418, which exhibited potent CDK8 inhibition (IC50 of 129 nM) and high CDK8 selectivity. Treatment with E966-0530-45418 significantly inhibited prostate cancer cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at both the RNA and protein levels. Further mechanistic analysis indicated that E966-0530-45418 suppresses prostate cancer metastasis by decreasing CDK8 activity and inhibiting TGF-β1-mediated Smad3/RNA polymerase II linker phosphorylation and Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling. The results in animal model also showed that E966-0530-45418 exhibited anti-metastatic properties in vivo.

Results:   BMI > 30 kg/m2 was associated with increased risk of lithiasis, kidney cancer, overactive bladder, male hypogonadism, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and erectile dysfunction (p < .05).

Introduction:   Image-guided surgery strategies can help visualize individual lymphatic drainage patterns and sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in PCa patients. For lymphatic mapping radioactive, fluorescent and hybrid tracers are being clinically exploited. In this prospective randomized phase II trial, we made a head-to-head comparison between ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid (hybrid group) and 99mTc-nanocolloid and subsequent free-ICG injection (sequential group).  Methods:   PCa patients with a >5% risk of lymphatic involvement according to the 2012 Briganti nomogram and planned for prostatectomy were included and randomized (1:1) between ultrasound-guided intraprostatic tracer administration of ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid (n = 69) or 99mTc-nanocolloid (n = 69) 5 h before surgery. Preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT were performed to define the locations of the SLNs. Additionally, all participants in the sequential group received an injection of free-ICG at time of surgery. Subsequently, all (S)LNs were dissected using fluorescence guidance followed by an extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). The primary outcome was the total number of surgically removed (S)LNs and tumor-positive (S)LNs.  Results:   The total number of surgically removed (S)LN packages was 701 and 733 in the hybrid and sequential groups, respectively (p = 0.727). The total number of fluorescent LNs retrieved was 310 and 665 nodes in the hybrid and sequential groups, respectively (p < 0.001). However, no statistically significant difference was observed in the corresponding number of tumor-positive nodes among the groups (44 vs. 33; p = 0.470). Consequently, the rate of tumor-positive fluorescent LNs was higher in the hybrid group (7.4%) compared to the sequential group (2.6%; p = 0.002), indicating an enhanced positive predictive value for the hybrid approach. There was no difference in complications within 90 days after surgery (p = 0.78).  Conclusions:   The hybrid tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid improved the positive predictive value for tumor-bearing LNs while minimizing the number of fluorescent nodes compared to the sequential tracer approach. Consequently, the hybrid tracer ICG-99mTc-nanocolloid enables the most reliable and minimal invasive method for LN staging in PCa patients.""","""['Esther M K Wit', 'Gijs H KleinJan', 'Anne-Claire Berrens', 'Roos van Vliet', 'Pim J van Leeuwen', 'Tessa Buckle', 'Maarten L Donswijk', 'Elise M Bekers', 'Fijs W B van Leeuwen', 'Henk G van der Poel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['A randomised trial probes the higher efficacy of a hybrid radioactive and fluorescent tracer approach in high-complexity sentinel node biopsy during robotic surgery of prostate cancer.', 'Can Intraoperative Fluorescence Imaging Identify All Lesions While the Road Map Created by Preoperative Nuclear Imaging Is Masked?', 'Comparing the hybrid fluorescent-radioactive tracer indocyanine green-99mTc-nanocolloid with 99mTc-nanocolloid for sentinel node identification: a validation study using lymphoscintigraphy and SPECT/CT.', 'The impact of drainage pathways on the detection of nodal metastases in prostate cancer: a phase II randomized comparison of intratumoral vs intraprostatic tracer injection for sentinel node detection.', 'Head-to-head comparison of the hybrid tracer indocyanine green-99mTc-nanocolloid with 99mTc-Senti-Scint using sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy and single-photon emission computed tomography combined with computer tomography in melanoma.', 'Multispectral Fluorescence Imaging During Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Sentinel Node Biopsy: A First Step Towards a Fluorescence-based Anatomic Roadmap.', 'Exploring the Applications of Indocyanine Green in Robot-Assisted Urological Surgery: A Comprehensive Review of Fluorescence-Guided Techniques.', 'Detection of Tumour-Targeted IRDye800CW Tracer with Commercially Available Laparoscopic Surgical Systems.', 'Sentinel Lymph Node Techniques in Urologic Oncology: Current Knowledge and Application.', 'A randomised trial probes the higher efficacy of a hybrid radioactive and fluorescent tracer approach in high-complexity sentinel node biopsy during robotic surgery of prostate cancer.']"""

The additional value of PSA density, Prostate Health Index, and Prostate Health Index density to MRI PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting & Data System) score was evaluated with multivariable analyses, area under the curve, and decision curve analyses. The proportion of unnecessary biopsies that can be avoided are estimated for clinically significant prostate cancer (International Society of Urological Pathology group ≥2 prostate cancer).  Results:   A total of 1,215 men were analyzed. Prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer were diagnosed in 51% (617/1,215) and 35% (422/1,215) of men, respectively.

The roles of SMYD2 in PCa and the regulators of c-Myc activity in PCa are still under-researched. SMYD2 expression and survival outcomes in PCa cohorts were analyzed by bioinformatics analysis. SMYD2 protein levels were detected in PCa tissues by immunohistochemistry. SMYD2 knockdown cells were established to identify the effects of SMYD2 on cell growth in vitro and in vivo. GSEA and RNA sequencing were adopted to reconnoiter the signaling regulated by SMYD2 in PCa. The relationship between SMYD2 and c-Myc was examined by western blot analysis, qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. SMYD2 specific inhibitor-AZ505 was used to pharmacologically inhibit SMYD2 function in vitro and in vivo. SMYD2 expression increased in PCa tissues compared with benign prostate tissues and higher SMYD2 expression was associated with a higher risk of biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy. SMYD2 knockdown inhibited the growth of PCa cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, high SMYD2 levels conduced to activated c-Myc signaling in PCa cells. Importantly, the pharmacological intervention of SMYD2 by AZ505 significantly repressed PCa cell growth both in vitro and in vivo.

While studies have previously evaluated perioperative outcomes of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), this study investigates disparities in access and clinical outcomes of RARP.  Study design:   The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients who received radical prostatectomy for cancer between 2010 and 2017 with outcomes through 2018. RARP was compared to open radical prostatectomy (ORP). Odds of receiving RARP were evaluated while adjusting for covariates. Overall survival was evaluated using a propensity-score matched cohort.  Results:   Overall, 354 752 patients were included with 297 676 (83.9%) receiving RARP. Patients who were non-Hispanic Black (82.8%) or Hispanic (81.3%) had lower rates of RARP than non-Hispanic White (84.0%) or Asian patients (87.7%, p < 0.001). Medicaid or uninsured patients were less likely to receive RARP (75.5%) compared to patients with Medicare or private insurance (84.4%, p < 0.001). Medicaid or uninsured status was associated with decreased odds of RARP in adjusted multivariable analysis (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.49-0.76).

While methods have been proposed to characterize pleiotropic components across groups of phenotypes, scaling these approaches to ultra large-scale biobanks has been challenging. Here, we propose FactorGo, a scalable variational factor analysis model to identify and characterize pleiotropic components using biobank GWAS summary data. In extensive simulations, we observe that FactorGo outperforms the state-of-the-art (model-free) approach tSVD in capturing latent pleiotropic factors across phenotypes, while maintaining a similar computational cost. We apply FactorGo to estimate 100 latent pleiotropic factors from GWAS summary data of 2,483 phenotypes measured in European-ancestry Pan-UK BioBank individuals (N=420,531). Next, we find that factors from FactorGo are more enriched with relevant tissue-specific annotations than those identified by tSVD (P=2.58E-10), and validate our approach by recapitulating brain-specific enrichment for BMI and the height-related connection between reproductive system and muscular-skeletal growth. Finally, our analyses suggest novel shared etiologies between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontal condition, in addition to alkaline phosphatase as a candidate prognostic biomarker for prostate cancer.

The present study aimed to investigate the potential relationship between N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA modification and PCa development and determine its clinical relevance.  Methods:   Through systematic analysis of the TCGA database and other datasets, we analyzed the gene expression correlation and mutation profiles of m6A-related genes between PCa and normal tissues. Patient samples were divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the results of Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox analysis. Subsequently, differences in biological processes and genomic characteristics of the two risk groups were determined, followed by functional enrichment analysis and gene set enrichment (GSEA) analysis. Next, we constructed the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of differentially expressed genes between patients in high- and low-risk groups, along with the mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network. The correlation analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells was further conducted to reveal the differences in immune characteristics between the two groups.  Results:   A variety of m6A-related genes were identified to be differentially expressed in PCa tissues as compared with normal tissues. In addition, the PPI network contained 278 interaction relationships and 34 m6A-related genes, and the mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA network contained 17 relationships, including 91 miRNAs. Finally, the immune characteristics analysis showed that compared with the low-risk group, the levels of M1 and M2 macrophages in the high-risk group significantly increased, while the levels of mast cells resting and T cells CD4 memory resting significantly decreased.

Recent studies have shown a potential relationship between metabolic syndrome and the progression and recurrence of prostate cancer (PCa). This study aimed to construct a metabolic syndrome-related prognostic index (MSRPI) to predict biochemical recurrence-free survival (BFS) in patients with PCa and to identify cold and hot tumors to improve individualized treatment for patients with PCa.  Methods:   The Cancer Genome Atlas database provided training and test data, and the Gene Expression Omnibus database provided validation data. We extracted prognostic differentially expressed metabolic syndrome-related genes (DEMSRGs) related to BFS using univariate Cox analysis and identified potential tumor subtypes by consensus clustering. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm and multivariate Cox regression were used to construct the MSRPI. We further validated the predictive power of the MSRPI using KaplanMeier survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, both internally and externally. Drug sensitivity was predicted using the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Finally, we explored the landscape of somatic mutations in the risk groups.  Results:   Forty-six prognostic DEMSRGs and two metabolic syndrome-associated molecular clusters were identified. Cluster 2 was more immunogenic. Seven metabolic syndrome-related genes (CSF3R, TMEM132A, STAB1, VIM, DUOXA1, PILRB, and SLC2A4) were used to construct risk equations. The high-risk index was significantly associated with a poor BFS, which was also validated in the validation cohort. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for BFS at 1-, 3-, and 5- year in the entire cohort was 0.819, 0.785, and 0.772, respectively, demonstrating the excellent predictive power of the MSRPI. Additionally, the MSRPI was found to be an independent prognostic factor for BFS in PCa. More importantly, MSRPI helped differentiate between cold and hot tumors. Hot tumors were associated with the high-risk group. Multiple drugs demonstrated significantly lower IC50 values in the high-risk group, offering the prospect of precision therapy for patients with PCa.

Methods:   The effects of zinc exposure on apoptosis levels were examined in both PC-3 and LNCaP cells. These cells were treated with exogenous ZnCl2 (100 µM) for 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h. Dansylaminoethyl-cyclen (DAEC) fluorescent probe was applied to visualize cellular zinc localization. Zinc-induced apoptosis was identified by Hoechst nuclear staining and flow cytometry analysis. TR3 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were detected by real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TR3 protein localization and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c were identified by immunofluorescence microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane potential collapse under fluorescence microscopy was examined with a MitoLight probe.  Results:   Zinc exposure led to gradually increasing apoptosis levels in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells over the 24-h treatment period. The apoptotic effects could be observed as early as after 4 h of zinc treatment in PC-3 cells, with this being seen at 8 h in LNCaP cells. The apoptosis levels of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells began to increase significantly from 8 to 24 h when necrotic cells were also found. TR3 protein translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria was noted and was accompanied by cytochrome c release into the cytosol from the mitochondria. Interestingly, no significant changes in TR3 mRNA expression levels were observed after zinc treatment. However, the mitochondrial membrane potential of both PC-3 and LNCaP cells gradually disappeared following extended zinc exposure.  Conclusions:   Zinc-induced apoptosis could be regulated through TR3 protein translocation from the nucleus to the mitochondria in prostate cancer cells without notable changes in TR3 mRNA levels. The direct effect of zinc on the mitochondria was associated with the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol through the mitochondrial targeting of TR3 protein.""","""['Ding Ma', 'Yuchen Guo', 'Yongqiang Fu', 'Jinfeng Wu', 'Ruimin Ren']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Transl Androl Urol""","""['Translocation of orphan receptor TR3 from nuclei to mitochondria induced by staurosporine.', 'TR3/Nur77 in colon cancer cell apoptosis.', 'Antisense TR3 orphan receptor can increase prostate cancer cell viability with etoposide treatment.', 'Vitamin A and apoptosis in prostate cancer.', 'p53 and Nur77/TR3 - transcription factors that directly target mitochondria for cell death induction.']"""

To estimate the theoretical excess risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM) with AS versus radical prostatectomy (RP), we determined the risk of PCSM in FIR men undergoing RP and modeled the PCSM risk for AS using a range of increased PSCM scenarios ranging from 1.25x to 2x higher relative to RP.  Materials and methods:   We retrospectively reviewed data from men undergoing RP from 1988 to 2017 at 8 Veterans Affairs hospitals within the SEARCH cohort. Men with FIR PC were identified using the NCCN risk criteria. Risk of PCSM at 5, 10, and 15 years after RP was estimated. Using these estimates, PCSM was then modeled for AS using a range of increased risk of PCSM relative to RP ranging from 1.25x to 2x higher.  Results:   For the 920 FIR men identified, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival estimates for PCSM after RP were 99.9%, 99.0%, and 97.8%, respectively. If the risk of PCSM on AS were 1.25-2x greater than RP, there would be 0.54%-2.17% excess risk of PCSM at 15 years.  Conclusions:   The risk of death for FIR after RP is very low. Assuming even modestly increased PCSM with AS versus RP, the excess risk of death for AS in FIR is low even up to 15 years. These data support the consideration of AS as a relatively safe alternative to RP in FIR men, though prospective randomized trials are needed to validate these findings.""","""['Paige K Kuhlmann', 'Taofik Oyekunle', 'Zachary Klaassen', 'Christopher L Amling', 'William J Aronson', 'Matthew R Cooperberg', 'Christopher J Kane', 'Martha K Terris', 'Stephen J Freedland']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""['Risk Group and Death From Prostate Cancer: Implications for Active Surveillance in Men With Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus deferred treatment for localised prostate cancer.', 'Impact of surgical margin status on prostate-cancer-specific mortality.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.', 'Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer.']"""

This prospective cohort study aimed to compare the long-term cardiovascular risks between GnRH agonists and antagonists.  Materials and methods:   Patients with PCa receiving GnRH agonists or antagonists during 2013-2021 in Hong Kong were identified. Patients with <6 months' prescriptions, who were switching between drugs, had missing baseline prostate-specific antigen level or had a prior stroke or myocardial infarction were excluded. Patients were followed up until September 2021. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as in the PRONOUNCE trial (MACEPRONOUNCE), i.e. a composite of all-cause mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction. The secondary outcome was MACECVM, i.e. a composite of cardiovascular mortality, stroke and myocardial infarction. Inverse probability treatment weighting was used to balance covariates between groups. The Log-rank test was used to compare the cumulative freedom from the primary outcome between groups.  Results:   In total, 2479 patients were analysed (162 GnRH antagonist users and 2317 agonist users; median age 75.0 years, interquartile range 68.0-81.6 years). Inverse probability treatment weighting achieved good covariate balance between groups. Over a median follow-up duration of 3.0 years (interquartile range 1.7-5.0 years), 1115 patients (45.0%) had MACEPRONOUNCE and 344 (13.9%) had MACECVM. GnRH agonist users had lower risks of MACEPRONOUNCE (Log-rank P < 0.001) and MACECVM (Log-rank P = 0.027). However, no differences were observed within 1 year of follow-up (MACEPRONOUNCE: Log-rank P = 0.308; MACECVM: Log-rank P = 0.357). Among patients without cardiovascular risk factors at baseline, GnRH agonist users had lower risks of MACEPRONOUNCE (Log-rank P < 0.001) and MACECVM (Log-rank P = 0.001), whereas no differences were observed in those with such risk factor(s) (MACEPRONOUNCE: Log-rank P = 0.569; MACECVM: Log-rank P = 0.615).

Methods and materials:   CTV and OARs of 109 prostate-bed patients were used to evaluate the performance of the vendor-trained model and custom retrained DLAS models using different training quantities. Two new models for OAR structures were retrained (n = 30, 60 data sets), while separate models were trained for a new CTV structure (n = 30, 60, 90 data sets), with the remaining data sets used for testing (n = 49, 19). The dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance, and mean surface distance were evaluated. Six radiation oncologists performed a qualitative evaluation scoring both preference and clinical utility for blinded structure sets. Physician consensus data sets identified from the qualitative evaluation were used toward a separate CTV model.  Results:   Both the 30- and 60-case retrained OAR models had median DSC values between 0.91 to 0.97, improving significantly over the vendor-trained model for all OARs except the penile bulb. The brand new 60-case CTV model had a median DSC of 0.70 improving significantly over the 30-case model. DLAS (60-case model) and manual contours were blinded and evaluated by physicians with contours deemed acceptable or precise for 87% and 94% of cases for DLAS and manual delineations, respectively. DLAS-generated CTVs were scored precise or acceptable in 54% of cases, compared with the manual delineation value of 73%. The 30-case physician consensus CTV model did not show a significant difference compared with the randomly selected models.  Conclusions:   Custom retraining using institutional data leads to performance improvement in the clinical utility and accuracy of DLAS for postprostatectomy patients. A small number of data sets are sufficient for building an institutional site-specific DLAS OAR model, as well as for training new structures.

Meanwhile, lung cancer screening with low-dose CT can reduce mortality. The UK National Screening Committee recommended targeted lung cancer screening on Sept 29, 2022, and asked for more modelling work to be done to help refine the recommendation. This study aims to develop and validate a risk prediction model-the CanPredict (lung) model-for lung cancer screening in the UK and compare the model performance against seven other risk prediction models.  Methods:   For this retrospective, population-based, cohort study, we used linked electronic health records from two English primary care databases: QResearch (Jan 1, 2005-March 31, 2020) and Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold (Jan 1, 2004-Jan 1, 2015). The primary study outcome was an incident diagnosis of lung cancer. We used a Cox proportional-hazards model in the derivation cohort (12·99 million individuals aged 25-84 years from the QResearch database) to develop the CanPredict (lung) model in men and women. We used discrimination measures (Harrell's C statistic, D statistic, and the explained variation in time to diagnosis of lung cancer [R2D]) and calibration plots to evaluate model performance by sex and ethnicity, using data from QResearch (4·14 million people for internal validation) and CPRD (2·54 million for external validation). Seven models for predicting lung cancer risk (Liverpool Lung Project [LLP]v2, LLPv3, Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool [LCRAT], Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian [PLCO]M2012, PLCOM2014, Pittsburgh, and Bach) were selected to compare their model performance with the CanPredict (lung) model using two approaches: (1) in ever-smokers aged 55-74 years (the population recommended for lung cancer screening in the UK), and (2) in the populations for each model determined by that model's eligibility criteria.  Findings:   There were 73 380 incident lung cancer cases in the QResearch derivation cohort, 22 838 cases in the QResearch internal validation cohort, and 16 145 cases in the CPRD external validation cohort during follow-up. The predictors in the final model included sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnicity, Townsend score), lifestyle factors (BMI, smoking and alcohol status), comorbidities, family history of lung cancer, and personal history of other cancers. Some predictors were different between the models for women and men, but model performance was similar between sexes. The CanPredict (lung) model showed excellent discrimination and calibration in both internal and external validation of the full model, by sex and ethnicity. The model explained 65% of the variation in time to diagnosis of lung cancer R2D in both sexes in the QResearch validation cohort and 59% of the R2D in both sexes in the CPRD validation cohort. Harrell's C statistics were 0·90 in the QResearch (validation) cohort and 0·87 in the CPRD cohort, and the D statistics were 2·8 in the QResearch (validation) cohort and 2·4 in the CPRD cohort. Compared with seven other lung cancer prediction models, the CanPredict (lung) model had the best performance in discrimination, calibration, and net benefit across three prediction horizons (5, 6, and 10 years) in the two approaches. The CanPredict (lung) model also had higher sensitivity than the current UK recommended models (LLPv2 and PLCOM2012), as it identified more lung cancer cases than those models by screening the same amount of individuals at high risk.  Interpretation:   The CanPredict (lung) model was developed, and internally and externally validated, using data from 19·67 million people from two English primary care databases. Our model has potential utility for risk stratification of the UK primary care population and selection of individuals at high risk of lung cancer for targeted screening. If our model is recommended to be implemented in primary care, each individual's risk can be calculated using information in the primary care electronic health records, and people at high risk can be identified for the lung cancer screening programme.

Though disseminated disease is initially sensitive to ADT, an important fraction of the patients progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). For this reason, the identification of novel effective therapies for treating CRPC is needed. Immunotherapeutic strategies focused on macrophages as antitumor effectors, directly enhancing their tumoricidal potential at the tumor microenvironment or their adoptive transfer after ex vivo activation, have arisen as promising therapies in several cancer types. Despite several approaches centered on the activation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in PCa are under investigation, to date there is no evidence of clinical benefit in patients. In addition, the evidence of the effectiveness of macrophage adoptive transfer on PCa is poor. Here we find that VSSP, an immunomodulator of the myeloid system, decreases TAMs and inhibits prostatic tumor growth when administered to castrated Pten-deficient prostate tumor-bearing mice. In mice bearing castration-resistant Ptenpc-/-; Trp53pc-/- tumors, VSSP administration showed no effect. Nevertheless, adoptive transfer of macrophages activated ex vivo with VSSP inhibited Ptenpc-/-; Trp53pc-/- tumor growth through reduction of angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation and induction of senescence. Taken together, our results highlight the rationale of exploiting macrophage functional programming as a promising strategy for CRPC therapy, with particular emphasis on ex vivo-activated proinflammatory macrophage adoptive transfer.

Methods:   Patients with low-to-favorable intermediate risk class PCa were treated with exclusive SBRT (35 Gy in five fractions). Patients treated with MRgRT were enrolled in an Ethical Committee (EC) approved trial (Prot. n° 23,748), while patients treated with conventional linac were enrolled in an EC approved phase II trial (n° SBRT PROG112CESC). The primary end-point was the acute toxicity. Patients were included in the analysis if they had at least 6 months of follow-up for the primary end-point evaluation. Toxicity assessment was performed according to CTCAE v5.0 scale. International Prostatic Symptoms Score (IPSS) was also performed.  Results:   A total of 135 patients were included in the analysis. Seventy-two (53.3%) were treated with MR-linac and 63 (46.7%) with conventional linac. The median initial PSA before RT was 6.1 ng/ml (range 0.49-19). Globally, acute G1, G2, and G3 toxicity occurred in 39 (28.8%), 20 (14.5%), and 5 (3.7%) patients. At the univariate analysis, acute G1 toxicity did not differ between MR-linac and conventional linac (26.4% versus 31.8%), as well as G2 toxicity (12.5% versus 17.5%; p = 0.52). Acute G2 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity occurred in 7% and 12.5% of cases in MR-linac and conventional linac group, respectively (p = 0.06), while acute G2 genitourinary toxicity occurred in 11% and 12.8% in MR-linac and conventional linac, respectively (p = 0.82). The median IPSS before and after SBRT was 3 (1-16) and 5 (1-18). Acute G3 toxicity occurred in two cases in the MR-linac and three cases in the conventional linac group (p = n.s.).  Conclusion:   Prostate SBRT with 1.5-T MR-linac is feasible and safe.

To date, there are no studies with explicit focus on stigma in relation to oncological therapy. We investigated the role of oncological therapy on perceived stigma in a large sample.  Methods:   Quantitative data from 770 patients (47,4% women; 88%≥50 years) with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer were analyzed as part of a registry-based bicentric study. Stigma was assessed with the German version of the SIS-D; the validated instrument includes four subscales in addition to a total score. Data were analyzed using the t-test and multiple regression with various sociodemographic and medical predictors.  Results:   Of the 770 cancer patients, 367 (47,7%) received chemotherapy, possibly in combination with other therapy (surgery, radiotherapy). All stigma scales showed significant mean differences (effect sizes up to d=0,49) with higher scores for patients receiving chemotherapy. The multiple regression analyses of the respective SIS-scales demonstrate a significant influence of the variables age (ß≤- 0,266) and depressivity (ß≤0,627) on perceived stigma in all five models, and (in four models) a significant influence of the variable chemotherapy (ß≤0,140). Radiotherapy shows only a weak influence in all models and surgery has no relevance. The explained variance ranges from R2=27 to 46,5%.  Discussion and conclusion:   The findings support the assumption of an association of oncological therapy, especially chemotherapy, on the perceived stigmatization of cancer patients. Relevant predictors are depression and younger (<50) age. These (vulnerable) groups should therefore receive special attention and psycho-oncological care in clinical practice. Further research on the course and mechanisms of therapy-related stigmatization is also necessary.""","""['Beate Hornemann', 'Charis Haering', 'Leopold Hentschel', 'Anke Rentsch', 'Sabine Taubenheim', 'Anja Mehnert-Theuerkauf', 'Peter Esser', 'Jochen Ernst']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol""","""['Perceived stigmatization and its impact on quality of life - results from a large register-based study including breast, colon, prostate and lung cancer patients.', 'Stigmatization in Employed Patients with Breast, Intestinal, Prostate and Lung Cancer.', 'Body image mediates the effect of cancer-related stigmatization on depression: A new target for intervention.', 'Improving outcomes for women aged 70 years or above with early breast cancer: research programme including a cluster RCT.', 'Specialist breast care nurses for support of women with breast cancer.']"""

This work investigates the feasibility of low dose CBCT imaging capable of enabling accurate prostate radiotherapy dose calculation with only 25% projections by overcoming under-sampling artifacts and correcting CT numbers by employing cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (cycleGAN). Uncorrected CBCTs of 41 prostate cancer patients, acquired with ∼350 projections (CBCTorg), were retrospectively under-sampled to 25% dose images (CBCTLD) with only ∼90 projections and reconstructed using Feldkamp-Davis-Kress. We adapted a cycleGAN including shape loss to translate CBCTLDinto planning CT (pCT) equivalent images (CBCTLD_GAN). An alternative cycleGAN with a generator residual connection was implemented to improve anatomical fidelity (CBCTLD_ResGAN). Unpaired 4-fold cross-validation (33 patients) was performed to allow using the median of 4 models as output. Deformable image registration was used to generate virtual CTs (vCT) for Hounsfield units (HU) accuracy evaluation on 8 additional test patients. Volumetric modulated arc therapy plans were optimized on vCT, and recalculated on CBCTLD_GANand CBCTLD_ResGANto determine dose calculation accuracy. CBCTLD_GAN, CBCTLD_ResGANand CBCTorgwere registered to pCT and residual shifts were analyzed. Bladder and rectum were manually contoured on CBCTLD_GAN, CBCTLD_ResGANand CBCTorgand compared in terms of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), average and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance (HDavg, HD95). The mean absolute error decreased from 126 HU for CBCTLDto 55 HU for CBCTLD_GANand 44 HU for CBCTLD_ResGAN. For PTV, the median differences ofD98%,D50%andD2%comparing both CBCTLD_GANto vCT were 0.3%, 0.3%, 0.3%, and comparing CBCTLD_ResGANto vCT were 0.4%, 0.3% and 0.4%. Dose accuracy was high with both 2% dose difference pass rates of 99% (10% dose threshold). Compared to the CBCTorg-to-pCT registration, the majority of mean absolute differences of rigid transformation parameters were less than 0.20 mm/0.20°. For bladder and rectum, the DSC were 0.88 and 0.77 for CBCTLD_GANand 0.92 and 0.87 for CBCTLD_ResGANcompared to CBCTorg, and HDavgwere 1.34 mm and 1.93 mm for CBCTLD_GAN, and 0.90 mm and 1.05 mm for CBCTLD_ResGAN. The computational time was ∼2 s per patient. This study investigated the feasibility of adapting two cycleGAN models to simultaneously remove under-sampling artifacts and correct image intensities of 25% dose CBCT images. High accuracy on dose calculation, HU and patient alignment were achieved.

With the more accurate staging achieved with magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsies for prostate cancer diagnosis, the indication for bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection may be revised. We aimed to assess the feasibility of unilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection in the era of modern prostate cancer imaging.  Materials and methods:   We analyzed a multi-institutional data set of men with cN0 disease diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy who underwent prostatectomy and bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection. The outcome of the study was lymph node invasion contralateral to the prostatic lobe with worse disease features, ie, dominant lobe. Logistic regression to predict lymph node invasion contralateral to the dominant lobe was generated and internally validated.  Results:   Overall, data from 2,253 patients were considered. Lymph node invasion was documented in 302 (13%) patients; 83 (4%) patients had lymph node invasion contralateral to the dominant prostatic lobe. A model including prostate-specific antigen, maximum diameter of the index lesion, seminal vesicle invasion on magnetic resonance imaging, International Society of Urological Pathology grade in the nondominant side, and percentage of positive cores in the nondominant side achieved an area under the curve of 84% after internal validation. With a cutoff of contralateral lymph node invasion of 1%, 602 (27%) contralateral pelvic lymph node dissections would be omitted with only 1 (1.2%) lymph node invasion missed.  Conclusions:   Pelvic lymph node dissection could be omitted contralateral to the prostate lobe with worse disease features in selected patients.

The potential benefit of a healthy lifestyle contrasts sharply with the observed poor adherence to current international lifestyle guidelines. Thus, well-designed sustainable interventions of aftercare that can be translated into routine practice are highly recommended. The present pilot study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a multimodal lifestyle intervention program in PCa patients after radical prostatectomy (RP).  Methods:   In a single-arm study, carried out at the Martini-Klinik of the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany, 59 eligible men with locally advanced PCa were recruited within 3-6 months after RP and assigned to a multimodal lifestyle program. The program consisted of 10 weekly 6-7 h course days, with a focus on dietary control, physical activity (per World Cancer Research Fund recommendations) and psychological support. Primary objectives were feasibility, acceptability, completion rate, and safety. In addition, changes in lifestyle, psychological well-being, clinical and laboratory values were assessed. The study was registered in the German Clinical Trials Register (No. DRK S00015288 [MARTINI-Lifestyle-cohort] [www.germanctr.de]).  Results:   A high program acceptance was observed. Only three participants (5%) dropped out of the program prematurely. Personal feedback reflected appreciation for participation, personal gain through new knowledge and through the group experience. Without exception, all participants have taken part in follow-up examinations and no adverse events or incidents occurred. In addition, changes in lifestyle habits, clinical parameters and improved quality of life were detected.

This study extracts data on all patients referred over a 3.5-year period with the primary aim of comparing the diagnostic accuracy of Tc-PSMA and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) in the primary diagnosis of PC. The secondary aim was to assess the sensitivity of Tc-PSMA in detecting disease with relapse after either radical prostatectomy or primary radiotherapy.  Methods:   A total of 425 men referred for primary staging (PS) of PC and 172 men referred with biochemical relapse (BCR) were evaluated. We evaluated diagnostic accuracy and correlations between Tc-PSMA SPECT/CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), prostate biopsy, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and age in the PS group and positivity rates at different PSA levels in the BCR group.  Results:   Taking the biopsy's grade according to the International Society of Urological Pathology protocol as a reference, the sensitivity (true positive rate), specificity (true negative rate), accuracy (positive and negative predictive value), and precision (positive predictive value) for Tc-PSMA in the PS group were 99.7%, 83.3%, 99.4%, and 99.7%, respectively. Comparison rates for MRI in this group were 96.4%, 71.4%, 95.7%, and 99.1%. We found moderate correlations between Tc-PSMA uptake in the prostate and biopsy grade, the presence of metastases, and PSA. In BCR, the Tc-PSMA positive rates were 38.9%, 53.2%, 62.5%, and 84.6% at PSA levels of <0.2, 0.2 to <0.5, 0.5 to <1.0, and > 1.0 ng/mL respectively.  Conclusions:   We have shown that Tc-PSMA SPECT/CT using an enhanced reconstruction algorithm has a diagnostic performance similar to Ga-PSMA PET/CT and mpMRI in an everyday clinical setting.

In vitro mechanistic studies on PC3 cells included: annexin V-FITC staining, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization measurements, the activity of caspases 3 and 7, nuclear DNA fragmentation, cell cycle analysis, modulation of Bax, Bcl-2, Smac/Diablo, Alox-5, VEGF-A, CXCR4, and CXCL12 mRNA gene expression via RT-PCR, 2D migration (scratch assay), and 3D invasion (Boyden chamber). MPc extract was the most active, inducing cell death (p < 0.05) via apoptosis, as evidenced by nuclear DNA fragmentation and an increase in MMP depolarization (p < 0.05) as well as the activation of caspases 3/7 (MPc p < 0.01) in both PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. In addition, MPc upregulated Bax and Smac/DIABLO, downregulated Bcl-2 (p < 0.05), and inhibited ALOX-5 mRNA gene expression (p < 0.001). MPc was not cytotoxic against normal human fibroblast cells (HDFa) at the tested concentrations. Moreover, MPc inhibited migration and invasion of PC3 cells (p < 0.01). These effects were accompanied by the downregulation of both VEGF-A and CXCL-12 gene expressions (p < 0.001). A monounsaturated 5-alkyl resorcinol was isolated as the active compound in the MPc extract and identified as 5-henicosene-1-yl-resorcinol.""","""['Mohd Mukrish Mohd Hanafi', 'Harisun Yaakob', 'Simon Gibbons', 'Jose M Prieto']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Plants (Basel)""","""['In Vitro Pro-apoptotic and Anti-migratory Effects of Ficus deltoidea L.

The plant contains glucomoringin isothiocyanate (GMG-ITC) with therapeutic potential against various cancer cells. Therefore, GMG-ITC was evaluated for its cytotoxicity against the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line and its potential to induce apoptosis. GMG-ITC inhibited cell proliferation in the PC-3 cell line with IC50 value 3.5 µg/mL. Morphological changes as a result of GMG-ITC-induced apoptosis showed chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and membrane blebbing. Additionally, Annexin V assay showed proportion of cells in early and late apoptosis upon exposure to GMG-ITC in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, GMG-ITC induced a time-dependent G2/M phase arrest, with reduction of 39.1% in the PC-3 cell line. GMG-ITC also activates apoptotic genes including caspase, tumor suppressor gene (p53), Akt/MAPK, and Bax of the proapoptotic Bcl family. Early apoptosis proteins (JNK, Bad, Bcl2, and p53) were significantly upregulated upon GMG-ITC treatment. It is concluded that apoptosis induction was observed in PC-3 cells treated with GMG-ITC.

In the present study, towards the targeting of these carbohydrate analogues to prostate cancer (PCa), we synthesized prodrugs in which a parent thiophene or butenolide congener was conjugated through a self-immolative linker to 2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)ureido] pentanedioic acid (DUPA), a highly specific ligand for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is overexpressed on prostate tumors. Both prodrugs were found to be more active against receptor positive LNCaP than receptor-negative PC-3 cells, with 2.5 and 12 times greater selectivity for the more potent thiophene analog and the less active butenolide congener, respectively. This selectivity for LNCaP over PC-3 contrasted with the behavior of the parent drugs, which showed similar or significantly higher activity for PC-3 compared to LNCaP. These data support the notion that higher activity of these DUPA-derived prodrugs against LNCaP cells is connected to their binding to PSMA and suggest that the conjugation of PSMA ligands to this family of cytotoxic agents may be effective for targeting them to PCa.""","""['Patricia Gonzalez Periche', 'Jacky Lin', 'Naga V S D K Bhupathiraju', 'Teja Kalidindi', 'Delissa S Johnson', 'Nagavarakishore Pillarsetty', 'David R Mootoo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Synthesis of carbohydrate analogues of the THF-acetogenin 4-deoxyannomontacin and their cytotoxicity against human prostate cancer cell lines.', 'Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2, a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer.', 'Synthesis and anti-tumor activity of carbohydrate analogues of the tetrahydrofuran containing acetogenins.', 'Acetogenins as Potential Anticancer Agents.', 'Comparison of prostate-specific membrane antigen ligands in clinical translation research for diagnosis of prostate cancer.']"""

Both groups received official dietary recommendations. Blood samples were collected at baseline and endpoint and blood concentrations of different hormones and phytoestrogens were analyzed. The phytoestrogen-rich diet did not affect serum concentrations of testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1, or sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). However, we found a trend of decreased risk of increased serum concentration of estradiol in the intervention group compared to the control group but only in a specific genotype of ERβ (p = 0.058).

Materials and methods:   Images from pre-biopsy 3T bpMRI scans in clinically localised PCa patients of various risk categories (n = 15) were used to extract textural features. The genomic landscape of hypoxia-related gene expression was obtained using post-radical prostatectomy tissue for targeted RNA expression profiling using the TempO-sequence method. The nonparametric Games Howell test was used to correlate the differential expression of the important hypoxia-related genes with 28 radiomic texture features. Then, cBioportal was accessed, and a gene-specific query was executed to extract the Oncoprint genomic output graph of the selected hypoxia-related genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Based on each selected gene profile, correlation analysis using Pearson's coefficients and survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier estimators were performed.  Results:   The quantitative bpMR imaging textural features, including the histogram and grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), correlated with three hypoxia-related genes (ANGPTL4, VEGFA, and P4HA1) based on RNA sequencing using the TempO-Seq method. Further radiogenomic analysis, including data accessed from the cBioportal genomic database, confirmed that overexpressed hypoxia-related genes significantly correlated with a poor survival outcomes, with a median survival ratio of 81.11:133.00 months in those with and without alterations in genes, respectively.  Conclusion:   This study found that there is a correlation between the radiomic texture features extracted from bpMRI in localised prostate cancer and the hypoxia-related genes that are differentially expressed.

This study aimed to evaluate the expression of STEAP1 in response to taxane-based drugs and assess whether the sensitivity of PCa cells to treatment with paclitaxel, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel may change when the STEAP1 gene is silenced. Thus, wild-type and STEAP1 knockdown LNCaP and C4-2B cells were exposed to paclitaxel, docetaxel or cabazitaxel, and STEAP1 expression, cell viability, and survival pathways were evaluated. The results obtained showed that STEAP1 knockdown or taxane-based drugs treatment significantly reduced the viability and survival of PCa cells. Relatively to the expression of proliferation markers and apoptosis regulators, LNCaP cells showed a reduced proliferation, whereas apoptosis was increased. However, the effect of paclitaxel, docetaxel, or cabazitaxel treatment was reversed when combined with STEAP1 knockdown. Besides, these chemotherapeutic drugs may stimulate the cell growth of PCa cells knocked down for STEAP1.

The high proliferation and metastasis rates have made CRPC one of the most challenging types of cancer for medical practitioners and researchers. In this study, the anti-cancer properties and inhibition of CRPC progression by S. neglecta extract and its active constituents were determined using two CRPC cell lines, DU145 and PC3. The ethyl acetate fraction of S. neglecta (SnEA) was obtained using a solvent-partitioned extraction technique. The active constituents of SnEA were then determined using the HPLC technique, which showed that SnEA mainly contained syringic acid, pyrogallol, and p-coumaric acid phenolic compounds. After the determination of cytotoxic properties using the SRB assay, it was found that pyrogallol, but not the other two major compounds of SnEA, displayed promising anti-cancer properties in both CRPC cell lines. SnEA and pyrogallol were then further investigated for their anti-proliferation and apoptotic induction properties using propidium iodide and Annexin V staining. The results showed that SnEA and pyrogallol inhibited both DU145 and PC3 cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and significantly decreased the expression of cell cycle regulator proteins (cyclin D1, cyclin E1, CDK-2, and CDK-4, p < 0.001). SnEA and pyrogallol treatments also promoted apoptosis in both types of CRPC cells through significantly downregulating anti-apoptotic proteins (survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xl, p < 0.001) and upregulating apoptotic proteins (cleaved-caspase-9, cleaved-caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP-1, p < 0.001). Mechanistic study demonstrated that SnEA and pyrogallol inactivated the Akt signaling pathway leading to enhancement of the active form of GSK-3β in CRPC cell lines. Therefore, the phosphorylation of β-catenin was increased, which caused degradation of the protein, resulting in a downregulation of β-catenin (unphosphorylated form) transcriptional factor activity.

To further understand the biological function of NUSAP1, we used affinity purification and mass spectrometry proteomic analysis to identify NUSAP1 interactors. We identified 85 unique proteins in the NUSAP1 interactome, including ILF2, DHX9, and other RNA-binding proteins. Using proteomic approaches, we uncovered a function for NUSAP1 in maintaining R-loops and in DNA damage response through its interaction with ILF2. Co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization using confocal microscopy verified the interactions of NUSAP1 with ILF2 and DHX9, and RNA/DNA hybrids. We showed that the microtubule and charged helical domains of NUSAP1 were necessary for the protein-protein interactions. Depletion of ILF2 alone further increased camptothecin-induced R-loop accumulation and DNA damage, and NUSAP1 depletion abolished this effect. In human prostate adenocarcinoma, NUSAP1 and ILF2 mRNA expression levels are positively correlated, elevated, and associated with poor clinical outcomes.

Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) acting as a paracaspase in the regulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signal transduction plays a central role in inflammation and oncogenesis in cancers. This study confirmed the potential linkages between androgen and NF-κB activation by inducing MALT1 in the androgen receptor-full length (ARFL)-positive LNCaP and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Although androgen did not stimulate MALT1 expression in AR-null or ectopic ARFL-overexpressed PC-3 cells, the ectopic overexpression of the AR splicing variant 7 (ARv7) upregulated MALT1 to activate NF-κB activities in 22Rv1 and PC-3 cells. Since the nuclear translocation of p50 and p65 was facilitated by ARv7 to motivate NF-κB activity, the expressions of MALT1, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and N-myc downstream regulated 1 (NDRG1) were therefore induced in ectopic ARv7-overexpressed prostate cancer cells.

Participation of autoimmune responses in the pathophysiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (PBH) and a corresponding immunosuppressive therapy by TNFalpha antagonists has been recently suggested. Thus, autoAb testing could aid in the diagnosis of BPH patients profiting from such therapy. We generated CRISPR/Cas9 modified HEp-2 LEDGF knock-out (KO) and HEp-2 LEDGF/p75 over-expressing (OE) cells and examined IgG autoantibody reactivity to LEDGF/p75 in patients with prostate cancer (PCa, n = 89), bladder cancer (BCa, n = 116), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH, n = 103), and blood donors (BD, n = 60) by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Surprisingly, we could not detect elevated binding of autoAbs against LEDGF/p75 in cancer patients, but autoAb reactivity to LEDGF/p75 OE cells in about 50% of patients with BPH was unexpectedly significantly increased. Furthermore, a line immunoassay enabling the detection of 18 different autoAbs revealed a significantly increased occurrence of anti-dsDNA autoAbs in 34% of BPH patients in contrast to tumor patients and BD. This finding was confirmed by anti-mitochondrial (mDNA) autoAb detection with the Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence test, which also showed a significantly higher prevalence (34%) of anti-mDNA autoAbs in BPH. In summary, our study provided further evidence for the occurrence of autoimmune responses in BPH. Furthermore, LEDGF/p75 over-expression renders HEp-2 cells more autoantigenic and an ideal target for autoAb analysis in BPH with a potential therapy consequence.""","""['Victoria Liedtke', 'Laura Rose', 'Rico Hiemann', 'Abdullah Nasser', 'Stefan Rödiger', 'Alena Bonaventura', 'Laura Winkler', 'Mandy Sowa', 'Michael Stöckle', 'Peter Schierack', 'Kerstin Junker', 'Dirk Roggenbuck']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Antinuclear autoantibodies in prostate cancer: immunity to LEDGF/p75, a survival protein highly expressed in prostate tumors and cleaved during apoptosis.', 'LEDGF/p75 Overexpression Attenuates Oxidative Stress-Induced Necrosis and Upregulates the Oxidoreductase ERP57/PDIA3/GRP58 in Prostate Cancer.', 'The stress oncoprotein LEDGF/p75 interacts with the methyl CpG binding protein MeCP2 and influences its transcriptional activity.', 'LEDGF/p75: a novel nuclear autoantigen at the crossroads of cell survival and apoptosis.', 'LEDGF/p75-mediated chemoresistance of mixed-lineage leukemia involves cell survival pathways and super enhancer activators.', 'Mechanism of Androgen-Independent Stromal Proliferation in Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia.']"""

BUD31, also known as Functional Spliceosome-Associated Protein 17, is a protein that works at the level of the spliceosome; it is functionally implicated in pre-mRNA splicing as well as processing, while also acting as a transcriptional regulator of androgen receptor (AR) target genes. Clinically, the expression of BUD31 and its functions in the development and progression of PCa is yet to be elucidated. The BUD31 expression was assessed using IHC in a tissue microarray (TMA) constructed from a cohort of 284 patient samples. In addition, we analyzed the prostate adenocarcinoma (TCGAPRAD-) database. Finally, we used PCa cell lines to knockdown BUD31 to study the underlying mechanisms in vitro.Assesment of BUD31 protein expression revealed lower expression in incidental and advanced PCa, and significantly lower expression was observed in patients diagnosed with castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis and GSEA revealed that BUD31 increased processes related to cancer cell migration and proliferation. In vitro results made evident that BUD31 knockdown in PC3 cells led to an increase in the G2 cell population, indicating a more active and proliferative state. Additionally, an investigation of metastatic processes revealed that knockdown of BUD31 significantly enhanced the ability of PC3 cells to migrate and invade. Our in vitro results showed BUD31 knockdown promotes cell proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells via activation of p-AKT and vimentin. These results support the clinical data, where low expression of BUD31 was correlated to more advanced stages of PCa.""","""['Muhammad Choudhry', 'Yaser Gamallat', 'Ealia Khosh Kish', 'Sima Seyedi', 'Geoffrey Gotto', 'Sunita Ghosh', 'Tarek A Bismar']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Sin1 promotes proliferation and invasion of prostate cancer cells by modulating mTORC2-AKT and AR signaling cascades.', 'Elevation of androgen receptor promotes prostate cancer metastasis by induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduction of KAT5.', 'Androgen receptor as a regulator of ZEB2 expression and its implications in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer.', 'MAPK4 promotes prostate cancer by concerted activation of androgen receptor and AKT.', 'The prognostic significance of combined ERG and androgen receptor expression in patients with prostate cancer managed by androgen deprivation therapy.']"""

Cell uptake studies with GRPR-positive PC-3 cells and GRPR-negative NCI-H69 cells confirmed receptor specificity. Imaging and biodistribution studies at 4 and 24 h with 20 MBq/1 nmol [111In]In-12-15 were performed in nude mice bearing a PC-3 and NCI-H69 xenograft, and showed that the probe with only a pADA linker in the backbone had the highest tumor-to-organ ratios (T/O) at 24 h after injection (T/O > 5 for, e.g., prostate, muscle and blood). For this probe, a dose optimization study with three doses (0.75, 1.25 and 1.75 nmol; 20 MBq) revealed that the maximum image contrast was achieved with the lowest dose. Subsequently, the probe was successfully used for tumor excision in a simulated image-guided surgery setting. Moreover, it demonstrated binding to tissue sections of human prostate, breast and gastro-intestinal stromal tumors.

A Case Report and Issues to Consider in Enzalutamide-Resistant Oligoprogressive Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer""","""Background:   Metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a challenging disease, especially in heavily pretreated patients. Androgen pathway inhibitors have contributed to a notable improvement in the overall survival and quality of life in patients with mCRPC during the last decade. Still, a considerable percentage of patients are unable to draw benefits from this drug category and are deprived of a treatment that offers limited toxicity and preserves a good quality of life. The mechanisms leading to this pre-existing or acquired resistance, as well as the possible strategies to overcome this resistance have been put at the center of scientists' attention.  Case presentation:   With the present report we present the case of a 70-year-old patient with mCRPC, who was apparently an enzalutamide non-responder, but a multimodal approach with enzalutamide continuation and irradiation to his symptomatic oligoprogressive disease converted him to a responder with clinical, biochemical and imaging response; furthermore, we discuss the existing data providing evidence for the use of metastasis-directed therapy in combination with androgen pathway inhibitors in order to overcome drug resistance in patients with oligoprogressive disease.  Conclusion:   A considerable proportion of patients with oligometastatic or oligoprogressive prostate cancer who seem not to respond to androgen pathway inhibitors, such as enzalutamide, due to preexisting or acquired resistance, could benefit from MDT with a multimodal treatment approach. This strategy allows androgen pathway inhibitor continuation beyond biochemical progression and delays the switch to next-line systemic treatment.""","""['Georgios Ioannis Papageorgiou', 'Nikolaos Skouteris', 'Aikaterini Kosma', 'Athina Markouizou', 'Nikolaos Charalampakis']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Rev Recent Clin Trials""","""['Stereotactic body radiotherapy for oligoprogressive lesions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients during abiraterone/enzalutamide treatment.', 'Cabazitaxel Remains Active in Patients Progressing After Docetaxel Followed by Novel Androgen Receptor Pathway Targeted Therapies.', 'Molecular characterization of enzalutamide-treated bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Treating Patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Comprehensive Review of Available Therapies.']"""

However, the specific effects of heavy metals on cancers remain to be proven. To confirm the association between heavy metals and pan-cancer sex hormone levels among adults, 94,337 individuals from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were assessed. We examined the associations between pan-cancers associated with sex hormones (ovarian, testicular, breast, and prostate cancers) and heavy metals in blood/urine. The methods (the WQS (weighted quantile sums) and SVYGLM (survey generalized linear model) regressions) were used to evaluate the association between sex hormone-related cancers and each metal category by incorporating covariates. To evaluate the overall effect of heavy metals and detect the dose-response relationship between the prevalence of pan-cancers associated with sex hormones and heavy metals, RCS (restricted cubic splines) were applied. Environmental exposure to heavy metals may be associated with pan-cancers associated with sex hormones in adults in the USA. Prostate cancer was inversely associated with blood cadmium while positively associated with blood lead, urinary tin, and thallium. Breast cancer was inversely associated with blood lead. Ovarian cancer was positively associated with blood cadmium. We also found a non-linear dose-response relationship between pan-cancers associated with sex hormones and heavy metals, which was non-parametric, using RCS models. The OR for breast cancer decreased along with the increase in lead concentration under approximately 20 µg/dl, while the OR for prostate cancer increased between urine thallium levels of approximately 0.17-1.1 ng/ml. Pan-cancers associated with sex hormones are associated with exposure to heavy metals.

This allows medical facilities to measure reference air kerma rate of 125I seeds with their own well-type of ionization chamber. However, it is difficult to maintain the traceability chain because the 125I reference air kerma rate standards have been hardly utilized by medical facilities so far. Meanwhile, some serious incidents of contamination of the different source strengths and dead seeds were reported in Japan.To address the specific issues in Japan, JASTRO Brachytherapy Subcommittee established a working group (WG) in 2021. The goal of this WG is to investigate the management methods of source strength measurement used in medical facilities, and to discuss the ideal and practicable methods of source management such as verifying the number of seeds and source strength. Initially, a questionnaire survey was conducted to facilities offering 125I seed brachytherapy in Japan. Sixty-seven out of 95 facilities responded (response rate 70.5%). This survey revealed that 41% of facilities did not perform either confirmation of the number of seeds or measurement of source strength. There are several reasons why the source strength was not measured in those facilities. For example, 125I seeds are provided under the sterilized conditions; quality assurance by source suppliers is reliable; and there is not sufficient staff.The single-seed assay is regarded as an internationally standardized and the most reliable measurement method. Therefore, it is an essential measurement technique to ensure traceability of source strength measurements. However, our survey found that most Japanese facilities do not perform single-seed assays. Meanwhile, some facilities have performed batch assay as an alternative method, in which all of the multiple sources in a batch are measured while loaded into sterilized cartridges. Although the measurement by the batch assay is less accurate than the one by the single-seeded assay, the batch assay does not require re-sterilization of the source and can be performed quickly. It might be useful to detect unexpected errors such as differences in the number of sources and abnormalities in source strength.In this report, we will introduce several methods of source strength measurement that have been implemented in medical facilities. The quality assurance of 125I seed sources in prostate interstitial brachytherapy should be provided not only by the source suppliers but also by the medical facilities that use sources to treat patients. We hope that medical facilities will refer to this technical report and use it as an aid to quality assurance in their own facilities.""","""['Toru Kojima', 'Shinji Kawamura', 'Yuki Otani', 'Takahiro Yamada', 'Hiroyuki Okamoto', 'Takeshi Kamomae', 'Osamu Yamashita', 'Takashi Ooshita', 'Tadahiro Kurosawa', 'Yuichiro Wakitani', 'Takashi Hanada', 'Atsunori Yorozu', 'Kenta Naniwa', 'Takahiro Moto', 'Gunji Hasegawa', 'Yu Furuhata', 'Katsuhisa Fujii']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Igaku Butsuri""","""['Verification of air-kerma strength of 125I seed for permanent prostate implants in Japan.', 'Source strength assay of iodine-125 seeds sealed within sterile packaging.', 'Well-ionization chamber response relative to NIST air-kerma strength standard for prostate brachytherapy seeds.', 'Radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources.

Methods:   This case-control study involved men with histologically confirmed PCa (n = 82), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH; n = 93) and controls (n = 98), aged between 40 and 80 years. Study participants were recruited from the main teaching hospital that draws clients from the entire Anambra State in South-Eastern Nigeria.

Statistical models were used to assess the exposure risk for cadmium exposure as well as the mediating effect of zinc status.  Results:   Among men with prostatic disorders (case-case analysis), every 10-fold increase in urinary cadmium was associated with increased risk of PCa (adjusted odds ratios: 2.526; 95% CI: 1.096-5.821). Men in the highest blood zinc quartile had lower odds of PCa compared to the lowest quartile (AOR: 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.54; p-for trend = 0.001). Zinc-specific effect was observed in this group: every 10-fold increase in urinary cadmium was associated with increased risk of PCa among men with creatinine-adjusted urinary zinc levels below the median value (AOR: 8.46; 95% CI: 1.97 -36.39) but not in those above the median value (AOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 0.45 - 5.39).

Phosphorylation of ABI2 at Ser183 by PIM1 increased ABI2 protein levels and enhanced WRC formation, resulting in increased protrusive activity and cell motility.

In vivo smooth muscle invasion assays showed that overexpression of PIM1 significantly increased the depth of tumor cell invasion, and treatment with PIM inhibitors significantly reduced intramuscular PCa invasion.

We aimed to identify subgroups of men who can safely remain on active surveillance despite preoperative reclassification to Grade Group 2.  Materials and methods:   We studied 249 active surveillance patients with surveillance biopsies classified as Grade Group 1 or Grade Group 2 who underwent radical prostatectomy. Perineural invasion, cancer volume, linear length and maximum percentage of Gleason pattern 4, and prostate-specific antigen density were evaluated. Radical prostatectomy adverse pathology was defined by any of: pN1; ≥pT3; ≥Grade Group 2 with ≥20% Gleason pattern 4; intraductal carcinoma; large cribriform glands.  Results:   A multivariable logistic regression model incorporating prostate-specific antigen density and perineural invasion stratified radical prostatectomy adverse pathology risk among Grade Group 1 and Grade Group 2 active surveillance patients. 57% (39/68) of Grade Group 1 men reclassified to Grade Group 2 while on active surveillance had favorable radical prostatectomy pathology. Those without biopsy perineural invasion and with low prostate-specific antigen density were more likely to have favorable radical prostatectomy pathology.  Conclusions:   Most Grade Group 1 men who enter active surveillance and subsequently reclassify to Grade Group 2 have favorable findings at radical prostatectomy and can remain on active surveillance. Among patients reclassified to Grade Group 2, those with low prostate-specific antigen density and without perineural invasion had the lowest risk of radical prostatectomy adverse pathology, comparable to (or below) that of Grade Group 1 patients who were not reclassified to Grade Group 2 preoperatively. Prostate-specific antigen density and perineural invasion stratify risk in active surveillance patients reclassified to Grade Group 2 and, if concordant with other clinicopathological and radiographic findings, can enable more patients to remain on active surveillance. Reclassification to Grade Group 2 alone should not disqualify men from remaining on active surveillance.""","""['Ezra Baraban', 'Eric Erak', 'Aisha Fatima', 'Amir Akbari', 'Jianping Zhao', 'Sean A Fletcher', 'Yasin Bhanji', 'Claire M de la Calle', 'Mufaddal Mamawala', 'Patricia Landis', 'Katarzyna J Macura', 'Christian P Pavlovich', 'Jonathan I Epstein']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Older Age Predicts Biopsy and Radical Prostatectomy Grade Reclassification to Aggressive Prostate Cancer in Men on Active Surveillance.', 'Selecting Patients with Favorable Risk, Grade Group 2 Prostate Cancer for Active Surveillance-Does Magnetic Resonance Imaging Have a Role?', 'Comparison of Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival after Radical Prostatectomy Triggered by Grade Reclassification during Active Surveillance and in Men Newly Diagnosed with Similar Grade Disease.', 'Prostatectomy pathology findings in an active surveillance population.', 'Risk Stratification of Low-risk Prostate Cancer: Individualizing Care in the Era of Active Surveillance.']"""

TDRD1, a germ cell-specific gene, is erroneously expressed in more than half of prostate tumors, but its role in prostate cancer development remains elusive. In this study, we identified a PRMT5-TDRD1 signaling axis that regulates the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PRMT5 is a protein arginine methyltransferase essential for small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) biogenesis. Methylation of Sm proteins by PRMT5 is a critical initiation step for assembling snRNPs in the cytoplasm, and the final snRNP assembly takes place in Cajal bodies in the nucleus. By mass spectrum analysis, we found that TDRD1 interacts with multiple subunits of the snRNP biogenesis machinery. In the cytoplasm, TDRD1 interacts with methylated Sm proteins in a PRMT5-dependent manner. In the nucleus, TDRD1 interacts with Coilin, the scaffold protein of Cajal bodies. Ablation of TDRD1 in prostate cancer cells disrupted the integrity of Cajal bodies, affected the snRNP biogenesis, and reduced cell proliferation. Taken together, this study represents the first characterization of TDRD1 functions in prostate cancer development and suggests TDRD1 as a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Hong Kim', 'Amrita Barua', 'Luping Huang', 'Tianyi Zhou', 'Modupeola Bolaji', 'Sharon Zachariah', 'Aroshi Mitra', 'Sung Yun Jung', 'Bin He', 'Qin Feng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Oncogene""","""['The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'The cancer testis antigen TDRD1 regulates prostate cancer proliferation by associating with snRNP biogenesis machinery.', 'snRNP protein expression enhances the formation of Cajal bodies containing p80-coilin and SMN.', 'A role for Cajal bodies in the final steps of U2 snRNP biogenesis.', 'Plant snRNP Biogenesis: A Perspective from the Nucleolus and Cajal Bodies.', 'PRMT5: a putative oncogene and therapeutic target in prostate cancer.']"""

Results:   Being a cancer survivor was associated with screening for gastric (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.04-2.95), colorectal (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.03-2.36), and lung cancer (OR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.10-2.66) but not breast, cervical cancer or PSA test. Having a family cancer diagnosis was associated with colorectal and lung cancer screening. Having friends with a cancer diagnosis was associated with PSA test. Cancer survivors and family members perceived themselves as being more susceptible and worried about getting cancer than individuals without any cancer history. Cancer survivors strongly believed screening can detect cancer and were more likely to undergo screening. Subgroup analysis indicated an interrelation between gastric and colorectal cancer screening among survivors.

Robustness evaluation is critical in particle radiotherapy due to its susceptibility to uncertainties. However, the customary method for robustness evaluation only considers a few uncertainty scenarios, which are insufficient to provide a consistent statistical interpretation. We propose an artificial intelligence-based approach that overcomes this limitation by predicting a set of percentile dose values at every voxel and allows for the evaluation of planning objectives at specific confidence levels.Approach. We built and trained a deep learning (DL) model to predict the 5th and 95th percentile dose distributions, which corresponds to the lower and upper bounds of a two-tailed 90% confidence interval (CI), respectively. Predictions were made directly from the nominal dose distribution and planning computed tomography scan. The data used to train and test the model consisted of proton plans from 543 prostate cancer patients. The ground truth percentile values were estimated for each patient using 600 dose recalculations representing randomly sampled uncertainty scenarios. For comparison, we also tested whether a common worst-case scenario (WCS) robustness evaluation (voxel-wise minimum and maximum) corresponding to a 90% CI could reproduce the ground truth 5th and 95th percentile doses.Main results. The percentile dose distributions predicted by DL yielded excellent agreements with the ground truth dose distributions, with mean dose errors below 0.15 Gy and average gamma passing rates (GPR) at 1 mm/1% above 93.9, which were substantially better than the WCS dose distributions (mean dose error above 2.2 Gy and GPR at 1 mm/1% below 54). We observed similar outcomes in a dose-volume histogram error analysis, where the DL predictions generally yielded smaller mean errors and standard deviations than the WCS evaluation doses.Significance. The proposed method produces accurate and fast predictions (∼2.5 s for one percentile dose distribution) for a given confidence level. Thus, the method has the potential to improve robustness evaluation.""","""['Ivan Vazquez', 'Mary P Gronberg', 'Xiaodong Zhang', 'Laurence E Court', 'X Ronald Zhu', 'Steven J Frank', 'Ming Yang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Phys Med Biol""","""['Practical robustness evaluation in radiotherapy - A photon and proton-proof alternative to PTV-based plan evaluation.', 'Superiority in Robustness of Multifield Optimization Over Single-Field Optimization for Pencil-Beam Proton Therapy for Oropharynx Carcinoma: An Enhanced Robustness Analysis.', ""Advantages and limitations of the 'worst case scenario' approach in IMPT treatment planning."", 'A novel and individualized robust optimization method using normalized dose interval volume constraints (NDIVC) for intensity-modulated proton radiotherapy.', 'Development of a Monte Carlo based robustness calculation and evaluation tool.']"""

Methods:   Expression level of LINC01002, miR-650, or filamin A (FLNA) in PCa tissues and cells was assessed using quantitative real-time PCR or Western blotting. Cell proliferative and migratory capacities were investigated by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and wound healing assays. Cell apoptosis was investigated by the levels of Bax and Bcl-2. Xenograft models were constructed to testify the role of LINC01002 in vivo. The anticipated binding of miR-650 to LINC01002 or FLNA was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter or RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation assays.  Results:   Relatively poor expression of LINC01002 and FLNA, and high expression of miR-650 were identified in PCa tumor specimens and cells. Ectopic LINC01002 expression restrained PCa cell proliferation/migration and provoked apoptosis in vitro, and blocked solid tumor growth in Xenograft models. MiR-650 was directly targeted by LINC01002, and it also directly bound to FLNA. MiR-650 reintroduction in PCa cells overexpressing LINC01002 or FLNA partly reversed the anticancer effects of LINC01002 or FLNA overexpression, thus recovering PCa cell proliferation/migration and repressing apoptosis.  Conclusion:   LINC01002 deregulation was linked to PCa development.

We sought to externally validate this model in a broader group of men with docetaxel-naïve mCRPC and in specific subgroups (White, Black, Asian patients, different age groups, and specific treatments) and to classify patients into validated two and three prognostic risk groupings on the basis of the model.  Methods:   Data from 8,083 docetaxel-naïve mCRPC men randomly assigned on seven phase III trials were used to validate the prognostic model of OS. We assessed the predictive performance of the model by computing the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (tAUC) and validated the two-risk (low and high) and three-risk prognostic groups (low, intermediate, and high).  Results:   The tAUC was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.75), and when adjusting for the first-line androgen receptor (AR) inhibitor trial status, the tAUC was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.74 to 0.76). Similar results were observed by the different racial, age, and treatment subgroups. In patients enrolled on first-line AR inhibitor trials, the median OS (months) in the low-, intermediate-, and high-prognostic risk groups were 43.3 (95% CI, 40.7 to 45.8), 27.7 (95% CI, 25.8 to 31.3), and 15.4 (95% CI, 14.0 to 17.9), respectively.

However, this low-value PSA screening in males aged 70 years or older remains common.  Objective:   To characterize the factors associated with low-value PSA screening in males 70 years or older.  Design, setting, and participants:   This survey study used data from the 2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a nationwide annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that collects information via telephone from more than 400 000 US adults on behavioral risk factors, chronic illnesses, and use of preventive services. The final cohort comprised male respondents to the 2020 BRFSS survey who were categorized into the following age groups: 70 to 74 years, 75 to 79 years, or 80 years or older. Males with a former or current prostate cancer diagnosis were excluded.  Main outcomes and measures:   The outcomes were recent PSA screening rates and factors associated with low-value PSA screening. Recent screening was defined as PSA testing within the past 2 years.

The recent PSA screening rates were 55.3% for males in the 70-to-74-year age group, 52.1% in the 75-to-79-year age group, and 39.4% in the 80-year-or-older group. Among all racial groups, non-Hispanic White males had the highest screening rate (50.7%), and non-Hispanic American Indian males had the lowest screening rate (32.0%). Screening increased with higher educational level and annual income. Married respondents were screened more than unmarried males. In a multivariable regression model, discussing PSA testing advantages with a clinician (odds ratio [OR], 9.09; 95% CI, 7.60-11.40; P < .001) was associated with increased recent screening, whereas discussing PSA testing disadvantages had no association with screening (OR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77-1.17; P = .60). Other factors associated with a higher screening rate included having a primary care physician, a post-high school educational level, and income of more than $25 000 per year.  Conclusions and relevance:   Results of this survey study suggest that older male respondents to the 2020 BRFSS survey were overscreened for prostate cancer despite the age cutoff for PSA screening recommended in national guidelines. Discussing the benefits of PSA testing with a clinician was associated with increased screening, underscoring the potential of clinician-level interventions to reduce overscreening in older males.""","""['Sandhya Kalavacherla', 'Paul Riviere', 'Juan Javier-DesLoges', 'Matthew P Banegas', 'Rana R McKay', 'James D Murphy', 'Brent S Rose']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['PSA-Screening älterer Männer scheint gang und gäbe zu sein.', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.', 'Clinician Factors Associated With Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening in Older Veterans With Limited Life Expectancy.', 'Association Between Prostate-Specific Antigen Screening and Prostate Cancer Mortality Among Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic White US Veterans.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.', 'Benefits and harms of prostate-specific antigen screening for prostate cancer: an evidence update for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.']"""

Although artificial intelligence may assist in this task, lack of transparency has limited clinical translation. Purpose To develop an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model for clinically significant PCa diagnosis at biparametric MRI using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) features for classification justification. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive patients with histopathologic analysis-proven prostatic lesions who underwent biparametric MRI and biopsy between January 2012 and December 2017. After image annotation by two radiologists, a deep learning model was trained to detect the index lesion; classify PCa, clinically significant PCa (Gleason score ≥ 7), and benign lesions (eg, prostatitis); and justify classifications using PI-RADS features. Lesion- and patient-based performance were assessed using fivefold cross validation and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Clinical feasibility was tested in a multireader study and by using the external PROSTATEx data set. Statistical evaluation of the multireader study included Mann-Whitney U and exact Fisher-Yates test. Results Overall, 1224 men (median age, 67 years; IQR, 62-73 years) had 3260 prostatic lesions (372 lesions with Gleason score of 6; 743 lesions with Gleason score of ≥ 7; 2145 benign lesions). XAI reliably detected clinically significant PCa in internal (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.89) and external test sets (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.87) with a sensitivity of 93% (95% CI: 87, 98) and an average of one false-positive finding per patient. Accuracy of the visual and textual explanations of XAI classifications was 80% (1080 of 1352), confirmed by experts. XAI-assisted readings improved the confidence (4.1 vs 3.4 on a five-point Likert scale; P = .007) of nonexperts in assessing PI-RADS 3 lesions, reducing reading time by 58 seconds (P = .009). Conclusion The explainable AI model reliably detected and classified clinically significant prostate cancer and improved the confidence and reading time of nonexperts while providing visual and textual explanations using well-established imaging features. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Methods:   Five cancer centres of the ROC, with their own cancer specific GOM, were selected. In our analysis, we have focused on four neoplasms: lung, colon, ovarian and prostate cancers. The median time for pre-GOM and GOM Times was calculated for each tumour site. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to individuate risk factors for pre-GOM and GOM Time.  Results:   Significant differences were observed for prostate cancer compared to other patients either for pre-GOM or GOM Times. Significant risks were found for ovarian and prostate cancers in pre-GOM time and for prostate cancer in GOM-Time.  Conclusions:   This experience will produce knowledge and data to guide decision-making and to manage more effectively the challenges of fighting cancer in Campania region. The Valutazione Percorso Rete Oncologica Campana (ValPeROC) study evaluates, for the first time, the ROC activity, through the analysis of key performance indices.

Patients and methods:   Overall, 934 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive relugolix 120 mg orally once daily or leuprolide injections every 12 weeks for 48 weeks. In the setting of rising PSA, patients could receive enzalutamide or docetaxel 2 months after study initiation. Assessments included sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (<50 ng/dL) through 48 weeks and safety parameters. Subgroups analyzed included patients with or without concomitant enzalutamide or docetaxel. A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was performed excluding patients who received concomitant therapies that may affect testosterone. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of 20 participants in the relugolix treatment group assessed the net effect of enzalutamide on exposure to relugolix.  Results:   Overall, 125 patients (13.4%) took concomitant therapies that could impact testosterone levels. Enzalutamide (n = 23) was the most frequently used therapy in the relugolix (2.7%) and leuprolide groups (1.9%). Docetaxel (n = 13) was used by 1.3% and 1.6% of patients in the relugolix and leuprolide groups, respectively. All other relevant concomitant therapy were used in <1% of population. Sensitivity analysis showed concomitant therapy did not impact the testosterone levels. Castration rates were similar with and without concomitant use of enzalutamide or docetaxel. No clinically relevant differences in adverse events were observed between subgroups in either treatment group. No differences in relugolix Ctrough or testosterone concentrations were observed, suggesting that any induction or inhibition properties of enzalutamide on relugolix metabolism result in a neutral net effect on relugolix exposure and testosterone suppression.

We assessed the safety and feasibility of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted fluorescent tracer OTL78 in patients with prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this single-arm, phase 2a, feasibility trial with an adaptive design was carried out in The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Netherlands. Male patients aged 18 years or older, with PSMA PET-avid prostate cancer with an International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade group of 2 or more, who were scheduled to undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with or without extended pelvic lymph node dissection were eligible. All patients had a robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using OTL78. Based on timing and dose, patients received a single intravenous infusion of OTL78 (0·06 mg/kg 1-2 h before surgery [dose cohort 1], 0·03 mg/kg 1-2 h before surgery [dose cohort 2], or 0·03 mg/kg 24 h before surgery [dose cohort 3]). The primary outcomes, assessed in all enrolled patients, were safety and pharmacokinetics of OTL78. This study is completed and is registered in the European Trial Database, 2019-002393-31, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, NL8552, and is completed.  Findings:   Between June 29, 2020, and April 1, 2021, 19 patients were screened for eligibility, 18 of whom were enrolled. The median age was 69 years (IQR 64-70) and median prostate-specific antigen concentration was 15 ng/mL (IQR 9·3-22·0). In 16 (89%) of 18 patients, robot-assisted radical prostatectomy was accompanied by an extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Three serious adverse events occurred in one (6%) patient: an infected lymphocele, a urosepsis, and an intraperitoneal haemorrhage. These adverse events were considered unrelated to the administration of OTL78 or intraoperative fluorescence imaging. No patient died, required a dose reduction, or required discontinuation due to drug-related toxicity. The dose-normalised maximum serum concentration (Cmax/dose) in patients was 84·1 ng/mL/mg for the 0·03 mg/kg dose and 79·6 ng/mL/mg for the 0·06 mg/kg dose, the half-life was 5·1 h for the 0·03 mg/kg dose and 4·7 h for the 0·06 mg/kg dose, the volume of distribution was 22·9 L for the 0·03 mg/kg dose and 19·5 L for the 0·06 mg/kg dose, and the clearance was 3·1 L/h for the 0·03 mg/kg dose and 3·0 L/h for the 0·06 mg/kg dose.  Interpretation:   This first-in-patient study showed that OTL78 was well tolerated and had the potential to improve prostate cancer detection. Optimal dosing was 0·03 mg/kg, 24 h preoperatively.

Patients classified as low risk by the Rotterdam Prostate Cancer Risk Calculator are advised to forego biopsy (PBx). There is concern about missing clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). A clear pathway for follow-up is needed.  Material and methods:   Data for 111 consecutive patients were collected. Patients were encouraged to adhere to a PSA-density-based safety net after PBx was omitted. Cut off values indicating a re-evaluation were PSA density &gt;0.15 ng/mL/ccm in PBx-naïve patients and &gt;0.2 ng/mL/ccm in men with past-PBx. Primary endpoint was whether men had their PSA taken regularly. Secondary endpoint was whether a new multiparametric MRI was performed when PSA-density increased. Tertiary endpoint was whether biopsy was performed when risk stratification revealed an increased risk.  Results:   Median follow-up was 12 months (IQR 9-15 months). The primary endpoint was reached by 97.2% (n = 106). The secondary endpoint was reached by 30% (n = 3). The tertiary endpoint was reached by 50% (n = 2). Histopathologic analyses revealed csPCa in none of these cases. Risk stratification did not change (p = 0.187) with the majority of patients (89.2%, n = 99).  Conclusion:   The concern of missing csPCa when omitting PBx in the risk-stratified pathway may be negated. Changes in risk stratification during follow-up should lead to subsequent PBx. We suggest implementing a safety net based on PSA density and digital rectal examination (DRE).""","""['Henning Bahlburg', 'Karl Tully', 'Vincent Hoffmann', 'Julian Hanske', 'Nicolas von Landenberg', 'Florian Roghmann', 'Rein-Jüri Palisaar', 'Joachim Noldus', 'Sebastian Berg', 'Marko Brock']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Prediction of Prostate Cancer: External Validation of the ERSPC Risk Calculator in a Contemporary Dutch Clinical Cohort.', 'Who Benefits from Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging After Suspicion of Prostate Cancer?', 'Prostate cancer detection rate in men undergoing transperineal template-guided saturation and targeted prostate biopsy.', 'Changing the Prostate Cancer Detection Paradigm: Clinical Application of European Association of Urology Guideline-recommended Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Risk Stratification in Men with Suspected Prostate Cancer.', 'Multi-institutional analysis of clinical and imaging risk factors for detecting clinically significant prostate cancer in men with PI-RADS 3 lesions.']"""

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of metabolism, although its role in PCa remains unclear. Here, we show that genetic and pharmacological activation of AMPK provides a protective effect on PCa progression in vivo. We show that AMPK activation induces PGC1α expression, leading to catabolic metabolic reprogramming of PCa cells. This catabolic state is characterized by increased mitochondrial gene expression, increased fatty acid oxidation, decreased lipogenic potential, decreased cell proliferation, and decreased cell invasiveness.

However, insufficient data exists on how 5-ARI use affects MRI findings and yield of biopsy. This study explores the differences in imaging and prostate cancer diagnoses between patients receiving and not receiving 5-ARI therapy.  Methods:   From 2015 to 2020, we collected retrospective data of consecutive patients undergoing prostate biopsy at one centre. We included patients who were biopsy-naïve, had prior negative biopsies, or on active surveillance for low-grade prostate cancer. Clinical and pathological data was collected, including 5-ARI use, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PIRADS) classification and biopsy results.  Results:   351 men underwent saturation biopsy with or without targeted biopsies. 54 (15.3%) had a history of 5-ARI use. On mpMRI, there was no significant difference between the 5ARI and non-5-ARI groups in PIRADS distribution, number of lesions, and lesion location. Significantly fewer cancers were detected in the 5-ARI group (46.3% vs. 68.0%; p < 0.01). There were no significant differences in PIRADS distribution in 5-ARI patients with positive and negative biopsy.  Conclusion:   Our study found significant differences in biochemical, imaging and biopsy characteristics between 5-ARI and non-5-ARI groups. While both groups had similar PIRADS distribution, 5-ARI patients had a lower rate of positive biopsies across all PIRADS categories, which may suggest that the use of 5ARI may confound MRI findings. Further studies on how 5-ARI therapy affects the imaging characteristics of prostate cancer should be performed.""","""['Ziting Wang', 'Kaiying Wang', 'Han Yang Ong', 'Woon Chau Tsang', 'Qing Hui Wu', 'Edmund Chiong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Effect of treatment with 5-α reductase inhibitors on progression in monitored men with favourable-risk prostate cancer.', 'Cancer detection rate of prebiopsy MRI with subsequent systematic and targeted biopsy are superior to non-targeting systematic biopsy without MRI in biopsy naïve patients: a retrospective cohort study.', 'The FUTURE Trial: A Multicenter Randomised Controlled Trial on Target Biopsy Techniques Based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in Patients with Prior Negative Biopsies.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer detection and management: a systematic review.']"""

Materials and methods:   Patients treated across 19 institutions were studied. The key endpoints that were evaluated were 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival (bRFS), metastases-free survival (MFS), overall survival, together with EBRT-related acute and late toxicities. The impact of various prognostic factors on the studied endpoints was analysed using univariate and multivariate analyses.  Results:   Among the 462 patients, 88% (405) had Gleason 9 disease and 31% (142) had primary Gleason pattern 5. A prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan was used for staging in 33% (153), 80% (371) were staged as T3/T4 and 30% (142) with pelvic nodal disease. The median ADT duration was 24 months; 66% received hypofractionated EBRT and 71.4% (330) received pelvic nodal irradiation. With a median follow-up of 56 months, the 5-year bRFS, MFS and overall survival were 73.1%, 77.4% and 90.5%, respectively. Primary Gleason pattern 5 was associated with worse bRFS, MFS and overall survival with hazard ratios of 0.51 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.73, P < 0.001), 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 0.96, P = 0.031) and 0.52 (95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.97, P = 0.040), respectively, whereas pelvic nodal disease was associated with worse bRFS (hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 0.98, P = 0.039) and MFS (hazard ratio 0.56, 95% confidence interval 0.37 to 0.85, P = 0.006). The acute and late radiation-related toxicities were low overall and pelvic nodal irradiation was associated with higher toxicities.

The objective of this study was to compare deep PSA response among patients with mCSPC newly initiated on apalutamide or enzalutamide.  Methods:   Clinical data from 69 community urology practices in the United States were evaluated. Patients with mCSPC were classified into cohorts based on their first dispensation (index date) for apalutamide or enzalutamide and were followed until the earliest of treatment discontinuation, initiation of a new next-generation androgen receptor signaling inhibitor, end of clinical activity (including death), or end of data availability (03/05/2021). Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) were used to reduce baseline confounding. PSA90 was defined as the earliest ≥90% PSA decline relative to baseline PSA. The proportion of patients achieving PSA90 and time to PSA90 were reported using weighted Kaplan-Meier analysis and weighted Cox proportional hazards models, respectively.  Results:   The apalutamide and enzalutamide cohorts comprised 186 and 165 patients, respectively. Patient characteristics were generally well balanced after IPTW. By 6 months, patients initiated on apalutamide had a 56% greater likelihood of attaining PSA90 than those initiated on enzalutamide (P = 0.014). This result remained significant through the end of the observation period. The median time to achieving PSA90 was 3.1 months with apalutamide and 5.2 months with enzalutamide.  Conclusions:   This real-world study demonstrated that apalutamide initiation is associated with a significantly higher likelihood of achieving ≥90% reduction in PSA as compared to initiation of enzalutamide. Moreover, this deep PSA response was observed to occur earlier with apalutamide treatment than with enzalutamide.""","""['Benjamin Lowentritt', 'Dominic Pilon', 'Ibrahim Khilfeh', 'Carmine Rossi', 'Erik Muser', 'Frederic Kinkead', 'Dexter Waters', 'Lorie Ellis', 'Patrick Lefebvre', 'Gordon Brown']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Comparison of prostate-specific antigen response in patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer initiated on apalutamide or abiraterone acetate: A retrospective cohort study.', 'Deep, rapid, and durable prostate-specific antigen decline with apalutamide\xa0plus androgen deprivation therapy is associated with longer survival and improved clinical outcomes in TITAN patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Early prostate-specific antigen response among Black and non-Black patients with advanced prostate cancer treated with apalutamide.', 'Comparative efficacy of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors for treating prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Enzalutamide for the treatment of nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.']"""

Objective:   To better understand the safety and tolerability profile of relugolix, an oral non-peptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist, in combination with abiraterone acetate (abiraterone) and apalutamide, a phase I study was undertaken.  Patients and methods:   This is an ongoing, 52-week, open-label, parallel cohort study of relugolix in combination with abiraterone in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) or metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) [Part 1] and apalutamide in men with mCSPC or non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) [Part 2]. Eligible patients treated with leuprolide acetate or degarelix with abiraterone or apalutamide prior to baseline, at which time they were transitioned to relugolix. Assessments included reporting of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and testosterone serum concentrations. In this interim report, patients completing ≥12 weeks were included.  Results:   Overall, 15 men were enrolled in Part 1 and 10 in Part 2. Adverse events were mostly mild-to-moderate in intensity and were consistent with the known safety profiles of the individual medications. No transition (from prior ADT treatment)- or time-related trends in clinical laboratory tests, vital sign measurements, or ECG parameters were observed.

We developed a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligand consisting of a DOTA chelator for 111In labeling and a fluorophore/photosensitizer IRDye700DX (PSMA-N064). We evaluated the efficacy of PSMA-tPDT using PSMA-N064 in cell viability assays, a mouse xenograft model and in an ex vivo incubation study on fresh human PCa tissue.  Methods:   In vitro, therapeutic efficacy of PSMA-N064 was evaluated using PSMA-positive LS174T cells and LS174T wild-type cells. In vivo, PSMA-N064-mediated tPDT was tested in immunodeficient BALB/c mice-bearing PSMA-positive LS174T xenografts. Tumor growth and survival were compared to control mice that received either NIR light or ligand injection only. Ex vivo tPDT efficacy was evaluated in excised fresh human PCa tissue incubated with PSMA-N064.  Results:   In vitro, tPDT led to a PSMA-specific light- and ligand dose-dependent loss in cell viability. In vivo, tPDT-induced tumor cell apoptosis, delayed tumor growth, and significantly improved survival (p = 0.004) of the treated PSMA-positive tumor-bearing mice compared with the controls. In fresh ex vivo human PCa tissue, apoptosis was significantly increased in PSMA-tPDT-treated samples compared to non-treated control samples (p = 0.037).  Conclusion:   This study showed the feasibility of PSMA-N064-mediated tPDT in cell assays, a xenograft model and excised fresh human PCa tissue.

The creation of an expression-based subtyping model based on prostate-specific biological processes was sought.  Methods:   Unsupervised machine learning of gene expression profiles from prospectively collected primary prostate tumors (training, n = 32,000; evaluation, n = 68,547) was used to create a prostate subtyping classifier (PSC) based on basal versus luminal cell expression patterns and other gene signatures relevant to PCa biology. Subtype molecular pathways and clinical characteristics were explored in five other clinical cohorts.  Results:   Clustering derived four subtypes: luminal differentiated (LD), luminal proliferating (LP), basal immune (BI), and basal neuroendocrine (BN). LP and LD tumors both had higher androgen receptor activity. LP tumors also had a higher expression of cell proliferation genes, MYC activity, and characteristics of homologous recombination deficiency. BI tumors possessed significant interferon γactivity and immune infiltration on immunohistochemistry. BN tumors were characterized by lower androgen receptor activity expression, lower immune infiltration, and enrichment with neuroendocrine expression patterns. Patients with LD tumors had less aggressive tumor characteristics and the longest time to metastasis after surgery. Only patients with BI tumors derived benefit from radiotherapy after surgery in terms of time to metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.71; n = 855). In a phase 3 trial that randomized patients with metastatic PCa to androgen deprivation with or without docetaxel (n = 108), only patients with LP tumors derived survival benefit from docetaxel (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09-0.51).  Conclusions:   With the use of expression profiles from over 100,000 tumors, a PSC was developed that identified four subtypes with distinct biological and clinical features.  Plain language summary:   Prostate cancer can behave in an indolent or aggressive manner and vary in how it responds to certain treatments. To differentiate prostate cancer on the basis of biological features, we developed a novel RNA signature by using data from over 100,000 prostate tumors-the largest data set of its kind.

Objective:   The objective of our study was to assess the efficacy and safety of functional image-guided salvage radiotherapy (SRT) in patients with MLR in the prostate bed.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this international multicenter retrospective study across 16 European centers, eligible patients were initially treated by radical prostatectomy (RP) with or without pelvic lymph node dissection for localized or locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the prostate.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measured 4 wk after RP was <0.1 ng/ml. All patients presented a biochemical relapse after RP defined by an increase in PSA level of ≥0.2 ng/ml on two successive measures. Only patients with an MLR lesion in the prostatectomy bed visualized on functional imaging (multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography/computed tomography [PET/CT] choline, or PET/CT prostate-specific membrane antigen) were eligible. Patients with lymph node, bone, or visceral dissemination at restaging imaging (CT and/or bone scintigraphy and/or magnetic resonance imaging and/or PET) were excluded. Dose escalation was defined as a dose of >66 Gy prescribed to the prostate bed or to MLR. Toxicities were classified using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale, version 4.03. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes were metastasis-free survival (MPFS), biochemical progression-free survival, and overall survival. Genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities were analyzed.  Results and limitations:   Between January 2000 and December 2019, 310 patients received at least one dose escalation on MLR and 25 patients did not receive any dose escalation. The median PSA level before SRT was 0.63 ng/ml (interquartile range [IQR], 0.27-1.7). The median follow-up was 54 mo (IQR, 50-56). Five-year PFS and MPFS were 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: [64; 75]) and 84% (95% CI: [78; 88]), respectively. Grade ≥2 GU and GI late toxicities were observed in 43 (12%) and 11 (3%) patients, respectively. When the prescribed dose on the MLR lesion was ≥72 Gy, an improvement in 5-yr PFS was found for patients received at least one dose escalation (73% [95% CI: 65-79]) vs 60% [95% CI: 48; 70]; p = 0.03).  Conclusions:   In this contemporary study integrating functional imaging data, we found potential efficacy of SRT with dose escalation ≥72 Gy for patients with MLR in the prostate bed and with an acceptable toxicity profile. Prospective data exploring this MLR dose escalation strategy are awaited.  Patient summary:   In this report, we looked at the outcomes from salvage radiotherapy for prostate cancer and macroscopic relapse in a large European population. We found that outcomes varied with prostate-specific antigen at relapse, Gleason score, and dose escalation. We found potential efficacy of salvage radiotherapy with dose escalation for macroscopic relapse in the prostate bed, with an acceptable toxicity profile.""","""['Nicolas Benziane-Ouaritini', 'Thomas Zilli', 'Antoine Giraud', 'Gianluca Ingrosso', 'Mario Di Staso', 'Fabio Trippa', 'Pascal Pommier', 'Emmanuel Meyer', 'Giulio Francolini', 'Ulrike Schick', 'David Pasquier', 'Jean Marc Cosset', 'Nicolas Magne', 'Etienne Martin', 'Kémara Gnep', 'Raphaelle Renard-Penna', 'Ewen Anger', 'Vérane Achard', 'Nicolas Giraud', 'Cynthia Aristei', 'Victoria Ferrari', 'Corentin Pasquier', 'Hind Zaine', 'Osman Osman', 'Beatrice Detti', 'Tanguy Perennec', 'Inga Mihoci', 'Stéphane Supiot', 'Igor Latorzeff', 'Paul Sargos']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Oncol""","""['Assessing radiation dose for postoperative radiotherapy in prostate cancer: Real world data.', 'Outcome after PSMA PET/CT based salvage radiotherapy in patients with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy: a bi-institutional retrospective analysis.', 'Disease Control With Delayed Salvage Radiotherapy for Macroscopic Local Recurrence Following Radical Prostatectomy.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Salvage prostate brachytherapy (BT) is an effective and well tolerated treatment option. We sought to generate international consensus statements on the use and preferred technical considerations for salvage prostate BT.  Materials and methods:   International experts in salvage prostate BT were invited (n = 34) to participate. A three-round modified Delphi technique was utilized, with questions focused on patient- and cancer-specific criteria, type and technique of BT, and follow-up. An a priori threshold for consensus of ≥ 75% was set, with a majority opinion being ≥ 50%.  Results:   Thirty international experts agreed to participate. Consensus was achieved for 56% (18/32) of statements. Consensus was achieved in several areas of patient selection: 1) A minimum of 2-3 years from initial RT to salvage BT; 2) MRI and PSMA PET should be obtained; and 3) Both targeted and systematic biopsies should be performed. Several areas did not reach consensus: 1) Maximum T stage/PSA at time of salvage; 2) Utilization/duration of ADT; 3) Appropriateness of combining local salvage with SABR for oligometastatic disease and 4) Repeating a second course of salvage BT. A majority opinion preferred High Dose-Rate salvage BT, and indicated that both focal and whole gland techniques could be appropriate. There was no single preferred dose/fractionation.  Conclusion:   Areas of consensus within our Delphi study may serve as practical advice for salvage prostate BT.

However, long computation times limit the clinical implementation of MC-based treatment planning solutions. This work aims to apply deep learning (DL) methods, specifically a model trained with MC simulations, to predict accurate dose to medium in medium (DM,M) distributions in LDR prostate brachytherapy.Approach.To train the DL model, 2369 single-seed configurations, corresponding to 44 prostate patient plans, were used. These patients underwent LDR brachytherapy treatments in which125I SelectSeed sources were implanted. For each seed configuration, the patient geometry, the MC dose volume and the single-seed plan volume were used to train a 3D Unet convolutional neural network. Previous knowledge was included in the network as anr2kernel related to the first-order dose dependency in brachytherapy. MC and DL dose distributions were compared through the dose maps, isodose lines, and dose-volume histograms. Features enclosed in the model were visualized.Main results.Model features started from the symmetrical kernel and finalized with an anisotropic representation that considered the patient organs and their interfaces, the source position, and the low- and high-dose regions. For a full prostate patient, small differences were seen below the 20% isodose line. When comparing DL-based and MC-based calculations, the predicted CTVD90metric had an average difference of -0.1%. Average differences for OARs were -1.3%, 0.07%, and 4.9% for the rectumD2cc, the bladderD2cc, and the urethraD0.1cc. The model took 1.8 ms to predict a complete 3DDM,Mvolume (1.18 M voxels).Significance.The proposed DL model stands for a simple and fast engine which includes prior physics knowledge of the problem.

The present study seeks to explore the incidence, risk factors, and predictors of recovery associated with climacturia and penile length shortening following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Patients and Methods: From September 2018 to January 2020, 800 patients underwent RARP for primary treatment of localized prostate cancer. A survey was sent to patients following 1-year follow-up assessing outcomes of continence, erectile dysfunction, climacturia, and penile length shortening. Descriptive statistics were utilized to describe incidence and risk factors and logistic regression modeling was used to identify predictors associated with recovery. Results: Of the 800 patients surveyed, 339 (42%) and 369 (46%) patients responded, with 127/339 (37.5%) and 216/369 (58.5%) endorsing climacturia and penile length shortening. In univariate analysis, a lack of bilateral nerve sparing was associated with climacturia; high body mass index (BMI), high prostate weight, lack of nerve-sparing, and high pathologic stage was associated with penile length shortening. In logistic regression modeling, BMI, prostate weight, and p-stage were all significantly correlated with penile length shortening. Recovery from climacturia was associated with a preoperative International Index of Erectile Function-5 score >21. When patients were asked to rank the importance of these outcomes compared to erectile dysfunction and incontinence, <5% of patients ranked either climacturia or penile length shortening as a high priority following RP. Conclusion: While incidence of climacturia and penile length shortening following RP is significant, impact on patient- and partner-related quality of life are low in comparison to risks of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.""","""['Linda My Huynh', 'Benjamin Bonebrake', 'Farouk El-Khatib', 'Edward Choi', 'Faysal A Yafi', 'Thomas E Ahlering']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Endourol""","""['Andrianne Mini-Jupette Graft at the Time of Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Placement for the Management of Post-Prostatectomy Climacturia and Minimal Urinary Incontinence.', 'How to optimize patient selection for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: functional outcome analyses from a tertiary referral center.', 'The ""Mini-Jupette"" sling at the time of inflatable penile prosthesis implantation: Adequate treatment for erectile dysfunction with mild incontinence and/or climacturia after radical prostatectomy.', 'Neglected side effects after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review.', 'Management of Climacturia During Inflatable Penile Prosthesis Surgery.']"""

Patients and methods:   Sipuleucel-T was administered per current prescribing information. Results from STRIDE are presented together with updated STAMP results. Survival status of patients was updated using demographic information to query the National Death Index (NDI). Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to analyze survival.  Results:   Updated data reduced patient censoring in each study compared with the original analyses; the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OS are now estimable. Updated median OS (95% CI) is 33.3 (24.1-40.7) months for STAMP and 32.5 (26.0-45.1) months for STRIDE. There was no notable impact on median OS [HR, 0.727 (0.458-1.155); P = 0.177, reference = STRIDE].

More recently, detection of APC has been facilitated through multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and improved biopsy techniques, enabling earlier detection. The pathologic features and clinical significance of pure APC in a large contemporary series of well-characterized tumors have, to date, not been elucidated. Cases with APC defined as cancer present anterior to the urethra only were identified from 1761 consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens accessioned between January 2015 and August 2016. The clinicopathologic features of these cases were compared with those of pure posterior prostate cancer (PPC) and the features of anterior peripheral zone (APZ) cancers were compared with those of TZ cancers. In addition, the tumor series from 2015 to 2016 was compared with a cohort of 1054 patients accessioned before the utilization of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging in the routine workup of patients with prostate cancer. In the 2015-2016 series, there were 188 (10.7%) patients with APC compared with 5.4% in the series from the pre-multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging era. No difference was observed between APC and PPC with regards to patient age or mean serum prostate-specific antigen at presentation. Mean tumor volume and positive surgical margin (PSM) rates were significantly higher in APC. In contrast, PPC was more commonly high grade with more frequent extraprostatic extension (EPE). None of the cases of APC had infiltration of the seminal vesicle or lymph node involvement, in contrast to PPC, with almost 14% of cases in each category. The 3- and 5-year biochemical recurrence-free survival was significantly higher in APC when compared with PPC, although this was not retained on multivariable analysis which included tumor location. On division of APCs according to anatomic zone of origin, 45% were APZ cancer and 37% TZ cancer. On comparison of APZ and TZ cancers, there were no significant differences in mean age and serum prostate-specific antigen at presentation as well as tumor volume, Gleason score, and PSM rate. High-grade malignancy (Gleason score >3 + 4=7) was seen in 26% of TZ cancers which compared with 44% of APZ cancers and 56% of PPC cancers. The rate of EPE was significantly higher in APZ when compared with TZ cancer ( P< 0.0005); however, the biochemical recurrence rate was not significantly different between the groups. The prevalence of APC in radical prostatectomy specimens has increased in recent times, in association with earlier detection at a stage amenable to curative surgical treatment. APC, when compared with PPC, is less commonly high grade with less frequent EPE, despite the APC group having larger tumors and a higher PSM rate at presentation. However, not all anterior cancers are indolent. Anterior cancers are more commonly seen in the APZ than the TZ and APZ cancers appear more locally aggressive than TZ cancers.""","""['Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Lars Egevad', 'John W Yaxley', 'Shulammite Johannsen', 'Ian K Le Fevre', 'Joanna L Perry-Keene', 'Troy Gianduzzo', 'Charles Chabert', 'Gregory Coughlin', 'Robert Parkinson', 'Boon Kua', 'William Yaxley', 'Brett Delahunt']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Surg Pathol""","""['Anterior-predominant prostatic tumors: zone of origin and pathologic outcomes at radical prostatectomy.', 'Transitional zone and anterior peripheral zone of the prostate.

Elderly patients (Age > 70) and those who received hormonal therapy were excluded from analysis. Patients were treated to 35-36.25 Gy in 5 fractions delivered with the CyberKnife Radiosurgical System (Accuray).  Outcomes:   Ejaculatory function was assessed by ES-8 scores (range 4-40) with lower values representing increased interference or annoyance.  Results:   Median age at the time of treatment was 65 years. Median follow up was 24 months (IQR 19-24.5 months). 64.5% of patients had ED at baseline (SHIM < 22). The 2-year anejaculation rate was 15%. Mean composite ES-8 scores showed a decline in the first month following treatment then stabilized: 30.4 (start of treatment); 26.5 (1 month); 27.6 (3 month); 27.0 (6 month); 26.2 (9 month); 25.4 (12 month); 25.0 (18 month) and 25.4 (24 month). White race, higher pre-treatment SHIM (≥22), and higher ES-8 (≥31) at treatment start were significantly associated with a decreased probability of a clinically significant decline. Patient-reported ejaculate volume was significantly reduced at all time points post-SBRT. Ejaculatory discomfort peaked at 1 month and 9 months post-SBRT. Prior to treatment, 8.0% of men reported that they were very to extremely bothered by their ejaculatory dysfunction. The number of patients reporting this concern increased to 14.4% at one year and dropped to 11% at 24-months post-SBRT.  Clinical translation:   Patients undergoing prostate SBRT may experience meaningful changes in ejaculatory function and should be counseled on the trajectory of these side effects.  Strengths & limitations:   This was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. Subjective questionnaire responses captured limited aspects of ejaculatory function in this cohort.  Conclusion:   The high incidence of moderate to extreme bother in ejaculatory function before and after SBRT suggests a need for novel approaches to improving ejaculation.""","""['Tamir Sholklapper', 'Michael Creswell', 'Jonathan Cantalino', 'Michael Markel', 'Alan Zwart', 'Malika Danner', 'Marilyn Ayoob', 'Thomas Yung', 'Brian Collins', 'Deepak Kumar', 'Nima Aghdam', 'Rachel S Rubin', 'Ryan Hankins', 'Simeng Suy', 'Sean Collins']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""J Sex Med""","""['Ejaculatory Function Following Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy for Prostate Cancer.', 'Potency preservation following stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Patient-reported outcomes following stereotactic body radiation therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Proctitis following stereotactic body radiation therapy for prostate cancer.', 'Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for clinically localized prostate cancer: the Georgetown University experience.']"""

The aim of this treatment is preservation of erectile function by sparing the neurovascular bundles, the internal pudendal arteries, the corpora cavernosa, and the penile bulb. Internal pudendal arteries, corpora cavernosa, and penile bulb sparing can generally be achieved in all patients, but NVB sparing can be challenging due to its proximity to the prostate and is therefore dependent on tumor location. PCa patients that have sufficient erectile function at baseline and favorable tumor characteristics might benefit from this treatment. Currently, it is unclear what proportion of patients are eligible for neurovascular-sparing treatment and to what extent this is technically feasible.  Aim:   To define the eligibility and technical feasibility for neurovascular-sparing MRgRT in intermediate-risk localized PCa patients.  Methods:   A consecutive series of men that received 5 × 7.25 gray (Gy) MRgRT for localized PCa were included. Baseline erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 questionnaire. Additionally, the ability of sparing the neurovascular bundles was assessed in all patients. Per neurovascular-sparing protocol, the dominant intraprostatic lesion with a 4 mm isotropic margin should receive 34.44 Gy in ≥ 99% of the volume (i.e., high-dose area). When the high-dose area directly borders or overlaps the NVB because of a dorsolateral position of the dominant intraprostatic lesion, sparing of the NVB was considered not feasible on that side.  Outcomes:   Patient-reported IIEF-5 baseline questionnaires and the technical feasibility of NVB sparing were assessed.  Results:   Of the 102 men that completed the IIEF-5 questionnaire at baseline, 49.0% of patients reported to have an IIEF-5 score of ≥ 17. In those patients, the NVB could technically have been spared bilaterally in 20.0% and unilaterally in 68.0%.  Clinical implications:   Our findings define the potential population for neurovascular-sparing MRgRT for localized PCa and indicate the proportion in which the NVB can technically be spared.  Strength & limitations:   The major strength of this study is the prospective collection of data. The limitations include that the neurovascular-sparing feasibility definition is based on pre-clinical planning data.  Conclusion:   A substantial group of 49.0% of patients in our study had mild or no erectile dysfunction at baseline. Of these patients, the NVB could technically have been spared bilaterally in 20.0% and unilaterally in 68.0% during MRgRT.

Mounting evidence has shown that circRNAs may play critical roles in diverse malignancies. However, the biological relevance of m6A modification of circRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa) remains unclear and needs to be elucidated. Our data showed that circRBM33 was m6A-modified and was more highly expressed in PCa cells than in normal cells/tissues. The in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that downregulation/upregulation of circRBM33 inhibited/promoted tumour growth and invasion, respectively. Decreasing m6A levels rescued the tumour-promoting effect of circRBM33. Additionally, once modified by m6A, circRBM33 interacts with FMR1 by forming a binary complex that sustains the mRNA stability of PDHA1, a downstream target gene. Suppressed/overexpressed circRBM33 lowered/enhanced the ATP production, the acetyl-CoA levels and the NADH/NAD+ ratio. Moreover, depletion of circRBM33 significantly increased the response sensitivity to androgen receptor signalling inhibitor (ARSI) therapy, including enzalutamide and darolutamide, in prostate tumours. Our study suggested that the m6A-mediated circRBM33-FMR1 complex can activate mitochondrial metabolism by stabilizing PDHA1 mRNA, which promotes PCa progression, and can attenuate circRBM33 increased ARSI effectiveness in PCa treatment.

Reservoir placement in the SOR is a blind procedure despite the SOR being surrounded by many critical structures. To date only a handful of cadaveric studies have described the relevant anatomy.  Aim:   To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as an in-vivo model to study relevant retropubic anatomy critical for SOR reservoir placement.  Methods:   The study population included men with elevated prostate specific antigen or biopsy proven prostate cancer who (i) underwent pelvic MRI, (ii) without prior pelvic or inguinal surgery, and (iii) without pelvic radiation therapy. All MRIs were completed with a 3-Tesla scanner and endorectal coil. Both T1 and T2 weighted images were captured in both axial and sagittal planes. All images were reviewed by 2 independent reviewers under the supervision of a dedicated body MRI radiologist. Bladder volume was calculated using an ellipsoid formula.  Outcomes:   Relevant measurements included (i) the distance between the external inguinal ring (EIR) at the level of the pubic tubercle to the external iliac vein (EIV), (ii) the distance from the EIR at the pubic tubercle to the bladder (accounting for bladder volume) and (iii) the distance from the midline pubic symphysis to the bladder (accounting for bladder volume). Pearson correlation was used to determine correlated measurements.  Results:   A total of 24 patients were included. Median participant age was 63 years (interquartile range, 59-66). The mean EIR-EIV distance was 3.0 ± 0.4 cm, the mean EIR-bladder distance was 1.8 ± 1.0 cm and the mean distance from the superior pubic symphysis to bladder was 0.9 ± 0.3 cm. There was a weak correlation between bladder volume and distance between the EIR and bladder (r = -0.30, P = .16).  Clinical implications:   The use of MRI as an in-vivo model is a high-fidelity tool to study real time unaltered anatomy and allows for surgical preparation, diagnosis of anatomic variants and acts as a valuable teaching tool.

Methods:   The antitumour activity of CT7001, an orally bioavailable CDK7 inhibitor, was investigated across CRPC models in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Cell-based assays and transcriptomic analyses of treated xenografts were employed to investigate the mechanisms driving CT7001 activity, alone and in combination with the antiandrogen enzalutamide.  Results:   CT7001 selectively engages with CDK7 in prostate cancer cells, causing inhibition of proliferation and cell cycle arrest. Activation of p53, induction of apoptosis, and suppression of transcription mediated by full-length and constitutively active AR splice variants contribute to antitumour efficacy in vitro. Oral administration of CT7001 represses growth of CRPC xenografts and significantly augments growth inhibition achieved by enzalutamide. Transcriptome analyses of treated xenografts indicate cell cycle and AR inhibition as the mode of action of CT7001 in vivo.

With modern advances in medicine, its mortality has been considerably reduced. However, it is still a leading type of cancer in terms of deaths. The diagnosis of prostate cancer is mainly conducted by biopsy test. From this test, Whole Slide Images are obtained, from which pathologists diagnose the cancer according to the Gleason scale. Within this scale from 1 to 5, grade 3 and above is considered malignant tissue. Several studies have shown an inter-observer discrepancy between pathologists in assigning the value of the Gleason scale. Due to the recent advances in artificial intelligence, its application to the computational pathology field with the aim of supporting and providing a second opinion to the professional is of great interest.  Method:   In this work, the inter-observer variability of a local dataset of 80 whole-slide images annotated by a team of 5 pathologists from the same group was analyzed at both area and label level. Four approaches were followed to train six different Convolutional Neural Network architectures, which were evaluated on the same dataset on which the inter-observer variability was analyzed.  Results:   An inter-observer variability of 0.6946 κ was obtained, with 46% discrepancy in terms of area size of the annotations performed by the pathologists.

Nevertheless, how to achieve the targeted and effective release of Zn2+ and H2S, and reverse the concentration distribution within PCa tumor cells still highly challenging. Herein, combined with these pathological characteristics of prostate, we proposed a tumor microenvironment (TME) responsive Zn2+-interference and H2S-mediated gas synergistic therapy strategy based on a nanoplatform of tannic acid (TA) modified zinc sulfide nanoparticles (ZnS@TA) for the specific treatment of PCa. Once the constructed pH-responsive ZnS@TA internalized by cancer cells, it would instantaneously decomposed in acidic TME, and explosively release excess Zn2+ and H2S exceeding the cell self-regulation threshold. Meanwhile, the in situ produced Zn2+ and H2S synergistic enhancement of cell apoptosis, which is evidenced to increase levels of Bax and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, release of Cytochrome c in cancer cells, contributing to inhibit the growth of tumor.

Frequently, advanced CaP progresses to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), with 50#37;-70% of patients developing bone metastases. CaP with bone metastasis-associated clinical complications and treatment resistance presents major clinical challenges. Recent advances in the formulation of clinically applicable nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted attention in the fields of medicine and pharmacology with applications to cancer and infectious and neurological diseases. NPs have been rendered biocompatible, pose little to no toxicity to healthy cells and tissues, and are engineered to carry large therapeutic payloads, including chemo- and genetic therapies. Additionally, if required, targeting specificity can be achieved by chemically coupling aptamers, unique peptide ligands, or monoclonal antibodies to the surface of NPs. Encapsulating toxic drugs within NPs and delivering them specifically to their cellular targets overcomes the problem of systemic toxicity. Encapsulating highly labile genetic therapeutics such as RNA within NPs provides a protective environment for the payload during parenteral administration. The loading efficiencies of NPs have been maximized while the controlled their therapeutic cargos has been released. Theranostic (""treat and see"") NPs have developed combining therapy with imaging capabilities to provide real-time, image-guided monitoring of the delivery of their therapeutic payloads.

Exercise is cost-effective compared to usual care during oncological treatment; however, the significance of exercise intensity to the cost-effectiveness is unclear. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of the randomised controlled trial Phys-Can, a six-month exercise programme of high (HI) or low-to-moderate intensity (LMI) during (neo)adjuvant oncological treatment.  Methods:   A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed, based on 189 participants with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer (HI: n = 99 and LMI: n = 90) from the Phys-Can RCT in Sweden. Costs were estimated from a societal perspective, and included cost of the exercise intervention, health care utilisation and productivity loss. Health outcomes were assessed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), using EQ-5D-5L at baseline, post intervention and 12 months after the completion of the intervention.  Results:   At 12-month follow-up after the intervention, the total cost per participant did not differ significantly between HI (€27,314) and LMI exercise (€29,788). There was no significant difference in health outcome between the intensity groups. On average HI generated 1.190 QALYs and LMI 1.185 QALYs. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that HI was cost effective compared with LMI, but the uncertainty was large.  Conclusions:   We conclude that HI and LMI exercise have similar costs and effects during oncological treatment. Hence, based on cost-effectiveness, we suggest that decision makers and clinicians can consider implementing both HI and LMI exercise programmes and recommend either intensity to the patients with cancer during oncological treatment to facilitate improvement of health.""","""['Anna-Karin Ax', 'Magnus Husberg', 'Birgitta Johansson', 'Ingrid Demmelmaier', 'Sveinung Berntsen', 'Katarina Sjövall', 'Sussanne Börjeson', 'Karin Nordin', 'Thomas Davidson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""['Long-term resource utilisation and associated costs of exercise during (neo)adjuvant oncological treatment: the Phys-Can project.', 'Long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of high versus low-to-moderate intensity resistance and endurance exercise interventions among cancer survivors.', 'Short- and long-term effect of high versus low-to-moderate intensity exercise to optimise health-related quality of life after oncological treatment-results from the Phys-Can project.', 'A facilitated home-based cardiac rehabilitation intervention for people with heart failure and their caregivers: a research programme including the REACH-HF RCT.', 'A systematic review and economic evaluation of exercise referral schemes in primary care: a short report.']"""

Cabazitaxel, a next-generation taxane, shows favorable toxicity profile and is effective in docetaxel-resistant tumors. Despite initial responses, in most cases, prostate cancer patients acquire resistance to cabazitaxel. There is a need to identify molecular markers that can monitor and predict treatment response.  Methods:   We performed transcriptional exosome profiling (Human Transcriptome Array-HTA 2.0) from the plasma of 19 patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer at baseline and in patients after one cycle of cabazitaxel (C1). The patients were stratified in two groups (responders and nonresponders) according to their clinical response to cabazitaxel. Gene set enrichment analysis and ingenuity pathway analysis platforms were used for gene and pathway analysis.  Results:   We detected molecular differences in the exosomes from two groups of patients (nonresponders vs. responders) at baseline in pathways related to prostate cancer, oncogenic signaling, cytoskeleton, and immune system. In nonresponders, we found enrichment of cytoskeleton related gene (Stathmin-1 and ITSN1) that have been associated with resistance to cabazitaxel.

In the present study the objective was to investigate if chemotherapy added to endocrine therapy could improve progression-free survival (PFS).  Materials and methods:   Patients with hormone-naïve, non-metastatic prostate cancer and rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA), enrolled from Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Finland, were randomized to long-term bicalutamide (150 mg daily) or plus docetaxel (75 mg/m2, q3w, 8-10 cycles) without prednisone, after stratification for the site, prior local therapy or not, and PSA doubling time. The primary endpoint was 5-year PFS analyzed with a stratified Cox proportional hazards regression model on intention to treat basis.  Results:   Between 2009 and 2018, a total of 348 patients were randomized; 315 patients had PSA relapse after radical treatment, 33 patients had no prior local therapy. Median follow-up was 4.9 years (IQR 4.0-5.1). Adding docetaxel improved PFS (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50-0.93; p = 0.015). Docetaxel showed an advantage for patients with PSA relapse after prior local therapy (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.94; p = 0.019). One event of neutropenic infection/fever occurred in 27% of the patients receiving docetaxel. Limitations were slow recruitment, lack of enrolling patients without radical local treatment, and too short follow-up for evaluation of overall survival in patients with PSA relapse.  Conclusion:   Docetaxel improved PFS in patients starting bicalutamide due to PSA relapse after local therapy or localized disease without local therapy.

The gold standard therapy for advanced PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which targets androgen production and AR signaling. However, resistance to ADT develops via AR-dependent and AR-independent mechanisms. As reports on AR expression patterns in PCa have been conflicting, we performed cell-by-cell AR quantification by immunohistochemistry in the benign and malignant prostate to monitor changes with disease development, progression, and hormonal treatment. Prostates from radical prostatectomy (RP) cases, both hormone-naïve and hormone-treated, prostate tissues from patients on palliative ADT, and bone metastases were included. In the normal prostate, AR is expressed in >99% of luminal cells, 51% of basal cells, and 61% of fibroblasts. An increase in the percentage of AR negative (%AR-) cancer cells along with a gradual loss of fibroblastic AR were observed with increasing Gleason grade and hormonal treatment. This was accompanied by a parallel increase in staining intensity of AR positive (AR+) cells under ADT. Staining AR with N- and C-terminal antibodies yielded similar results. The combination of %AR- cancer cells, %AR- fibroblasts, and AR intensity score led to the definition of an AR index, which was predictive of biochemical recurrence in the RP cohort and further stratified patients of intermediate risk. Lastly, androgen receptor variant 7 (ARV7)+ cells and AR- cells expressing neuroendocrine and stem markers were interspersed among a majority of AR+ cells in ADT cases. Altogether, the comprehensive quantification of AR expression in the prostate reveals concomitant changes in tumor cell subtypes and fibroblasts, emphasizing the significance of AR- cells with disease progression and palliative ADT.""","""['Seta Derderian', 'Tarik Benidir', 'Eleonora Scarlata', 'Turki Altaylouni', 'Lucie Hamel', 'Fatima Zahra Zouanat', 'Fadi Brimo', 'Armen Aprikian', 'Simone Chevalier']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Pathol Clin Res""","""['Targeting the androgen receptor signaling pathway in advanced prostate cancer.', 'Expansion of mouse castration-resistant intermediate prostate stem cells in vitro.', 'Prostate fibroblasts enhance androgen receptor splice variant 7 expression in prostate cancer cells.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'A novel DNA methylation signature is associated with androgen receptor activity and patient prognosis in bone metastatic prostate cancer.']"""

Incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for migrant groups relative to Australian-born.  Results:   Compared with Australian-born residents, most migrant groups had significantly lower incidence rates for cancers of the colorectum, breast and prostate. The lowest rates of colorectal cancer were among males born in Central America (IRR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.29-0.74) and females born in Central Asia (IRR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.23-0.64). Males born in North-East Asia had the lowest rates of prostate cancer (IRR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.38-0.43) and females born in Central Asia had the lowest rates of breast cancer (IRR = 0.55, 95% CI 0.43-0.70). For lung cancer, several migrant groups had higher rates than Australian-born residents, with the highest rates among those from Melanesia (males IRR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.10-1.76; females IRR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.10-1.78).  Conclusions:   This study describes cancer patterns among Australian migrants, which are potentially helpful in understanding the etiology of these cancers and guiding the implementation of culturally sensitive and safe prevention measures. The lower incidence rates observed for most migrant groups may be maintained with continued emphasis on supporting communities to minimize modifiable risk factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption and participation in organized cancer screening programmes.

Results:   In PCa, a significant increase of ADC values after 6-12 months was measured after TULSA-PRO treatment by 29.1% (pre-TULSA: 0.79 ± 0.16 × 10-3 mm2/s, 6-12 months: 1.02 ± 0.35 × 10-3 mm2/s), while the corresponding value in the reference tissue decreased by 48.5% (pre-TULSA: 1.20 ± 0.15 × 10-3 mm2/s, 6-12 months: 0.91 ± 0.29 × 10-3 mm2/s). The mean ADC values in the early follow-up groups at 1 and 3 months did not change significantly.  Conclusion:   DWI with ADC as part of mpMRI can serve as a biomarker to dynamically monitor the follow-up after TULSA after 6-12 months. For early posttreatment progression, it is not suitable due to too many confounding variables.""","""['Lena Meyer', 'Andreas Bohlscheid', 'Oscar Lemmer', 'Jeroen van de Plas', 'Francois Leboutte', 'Boris A Hadaschik', 'Andreas Neisius', 'Winfried A Willinek']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['Differentiation of prostate cancer lesions in the Transition Zone by diffusion-weighted MRI.', 'Evaluation of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging Versus Standard Diffusion Imaging for Detection and Grading of Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.', 'Acute and subacute prostate MRI findings after MRI-guided transurethral ultrasound ablation of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: Physical Foundations, Limitations, and Prospective Advances of\xa0Diffusion-Weighted MRI.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.']"""

Methodology:   In this phase III randomized controlled trial, docetaxel naïve mCRPC patients were randomized to either apalutamide or placebo combined with abiraterone and prednisone. Multivariable Cox regression models were applied to determine the adjusted association of M-stage with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) and overall survival (OS). To determine the heterogeneity of treatment effect based on metastatic stage (M-stage) at presentation, Cox regression was applied with interaction terms between M-stage and treatment.  Results:   Among 972 patients, 432 had M0, 334 had M1, while M-stage at presentation was unknown in 206. There was no association of M-stage at presentation with rPFS in patients with prior local therapy (LT) (hazard ratio for M1-stage: 1.22 [95% confidence interval: 0.82-1.82]; unknown: 1.03 [0.77-1.38]) or without prior LT (M1-stage: 0.87 [0.64-1.19]; unknown: 1.15 [0.77-1.72]) with no significant heterogeneity. Similarly, there was no association of M-stage with OS in patients with prior LT (M1-stage: 1.04 [0.81-1.33]; unknown: 0.98 [0.79-1.21]) or without prior LT (M1-stage: 0.95 [0.70-1.29]; unknown: 1.17 [0.80-1.71]) with no significant heterogeneity. Based on M-stage at presentation, we did not find any significant heterogeneity in treatment effect on rPFS (interaction p = 0.13), and OS (interaction p = 0.87).

Methods:   The databases and files of 22 pathology departments from eight countries on three continents were queried to identify metastatic solid tumours of the penis and to characterize their clinical and pathologic features.  Results:   We compiled a series of 109 cases of metastatic solid tumours that secondarily involved the penis. The mean patient age at diagnosis was 71 years (range, 7-94 years). Clinical presentation commonly included a penile nodule/mass (48/95; 51%) and localised pain (14/95; 15%). A prior history of malignancy was known in 92/104 (89%) patients. Diagnosis was made mainly on biopsy (82/109; 75%), or penectomy (21/109; 19%) specimens. The most common penile locations were the glans (45/98; 46%) and corpus cavernosum (39/98; 39%). The most frequent histologic type was adenocarcinoma (56%). Most primary carcinomas originated in the genitourinary (76/108; 70%) and gastrointestinal (20/108; 18%) tracts, including prostate (38/108; 35%), urinary bladder (27/108; 25%), and colon/rectum (18/108; 17%). Concurrent or prior extrapenile metastases were identified in 50/78 (64%) patients. Clinical follow-up (mean 22 months, range 0-171 months) was available for 87/109 (80%) patients, of whom 46 (53%) died of disease.  Conclusion:   This is the largest study to date of metastatic solid tumours secondarily involving the penis. The most frequent primaries originated from the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts.

Purpose To develop a prognostic risk score using PSMA PET-derived organ-specific total tumor volumes for predicting overall survival in patients with prostate cancer. Materials and Methods Men with prostate cancer who underwent PSMA PET/CT from January 2014 to December 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. All patients from center A were split into training (80%) and internal validation (20%) cohorts. Randomly selected patients from center B were used for external validation. Organ-specific tumor volumes were automatically quantified from PSMA PET scans by a neural network. A prognostic score was selected using multivariable Cox regression guided by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The final prognostic risk score fitted on the training set was applied to both validation cohorts. Results A total of 1348 men (mean age, 70 years ± 8 [SD]) were included, with 918 patients in the training cohort, 230 in the internal validation cohort, and 200 in the external validation cohort. The median follow-up time was 55.7 months (IQR, 46.7-65.1 months; >4 years; 429 deaths occurred). A body weight-adjusted prognostic risk score integrating total, bone, and visceral tumor volumes obtained high C index values in the internal (0.82) and external (0.74) validation cohorts, as well as in patients with castration-resistant (0.75) and hormone-sensitive (0.68) disease. The fit of the statistical model for the prognostic score was improved compared with a model containing total tumor volume only (AIC, 3324 vs 3351; likelihood ratio test, P < .001). Calibration plots ascertained good model fit. Conclusion The newly developed risk score that included prostate-specific membrane antigen PET-derived organ-specific tumor volumes had good model fit for predicting overall survival in both internal and external validation cohorts.

Smoking has many well-established adverse effects, but its effects on benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) and associated LUTS are unclear. We sought to determine if smoking is a risk factor for the incidence of LUTS in asymptomatic men and for the progression of LUTS in symptomatic men.  Methods:   We performed a post-hoc analysis of Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events in 3060 ""asymptomatic"" men with baseline International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) < 8 and in 2198 symptomatic men with baseline IPSS ≥ 8 not taking 5α-reductase inhibitors or α-blockers. We used multivariable Cox regression models to assess associations between smoking status at baseline and LUTS incidence and progression. Among asymptomatic men, incident LUTS was defined as the first report of medical or surgical treatment for BPH, or sustained clinically significant LUTS (two reports of IPSS > 14). Among symptomatic men, LUTS progression was defined as IPSS increase of ≥4 points from baseline, surgical intervention for BPH, or starting a new BPH drug.  Results:   Of 3060 asymptomatic men, 15% (n = 467) were current, 40% (n = 1231) former, and 45% (n = 1362) never-smokers. Of 2198 symptomatic men, 14% (n = 320) were current, 39% (n = 850) former, and 47% (n = 1028) never-smokers. In asymptomatic men, compared with never-smokers, current and former smoking at baseline were not associated with LUTS incidence (adjusted hazard ratio [adj-HR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.78-1.48 and adj-HR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.80-1.30). In symptomatic men, compared with never-smokers, current and former smoking at baseline were not associated with the progression of LUTS (adj-HR = 1.11; 95% CI: 0.92-1.33 and adj-HR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.90-1.18).

In addition, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) signaling, which we have previously demonstrated to be induced in luminal cells of Pten(i)pe-/- mice and to promote malignant progression, is further activated. Importantly, we show that genetic and pharmacological inhibition of HIF1A sensitizes Pten-deficient prostatic tumors to castration and provides durable therapeutic responses. Furthermore, HIF1A inhibition induces apoptotic signaling in human CRPC cell lines. Therefore, our data demonstrate that HIF1A in prostatic tumor cells is a critical factor that enables their survival after ADT, and identify it as a target for CRPC management.""","""['Julie Terzic#', 'Mohamed A Abu El Maaty#', 'Régis Lutzing', 'Alexandre Vincent', 'Rana El Bizri', 'Matthieu Jung', 'Céline Keime', 'Daniel Metzger']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""EMBO Mol Med""","""['Anti-androgen therapy induces transcriptomic reprogramming in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in a murine model.', 'Pre-existing Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer-like Cells in Primary Prostate Cancer Promote Resistance to Hormonal Therapy.', 'RGS2 is prognostic for development of castration resistance and cancer-specific survival in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptors in hormone-dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA Regulation of Androgen Receptor in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Premises, Promises, and Potentials.']"""

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a cancer with high mortality that requires further exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms. In the present study, we aimed to discover novel potential biomarkers for diagnosing PCa and targeting treatment. Overexpression of the lncRNA, LINC00491, was verified in PCa tumor tissues and cell lines using the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cell proliferation and invasion were then analyzed via the Cell Counting Kit-8, colony formation, and transwell assays in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. The interaction of miR-384 with LINC00491, as well as TRIM44, was investigated via bioinformatics analyses, subcellular fractionation, luciferase reporter gene assays, radioimmunoprecipitation, pull-down, and western blot analyses. LINC00491 was overexpressed in PCa tissues and cell lines. LINC00491 knockdown resulted in impaired cell proliferation and invasion in vitro and decreased tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, LINC00491 acted as a sponge for miR-384 and its downstream target, TRIM44. Additionally, miR-384 expression was downregulated in PCa tissues and cell lines, and its expression was negatively correlated with LINC00491. A miR-384 inhibitor restored the inhibitory effects of LINC00491 silencing on PCa cell proliferation and invasion. LINC00491 is a tumor promoter in PCa via enhancing TRIM44 expression by sponging miR-384 to facilitate the development of PCa.

Previously, TRIM28 has been identified to suppress transposable elements, including L1 expression via its canonical role in chromatin remodeling. Here, we report that TRIM28 through its B box domain increases L1 retrotransposition and facilitates shorter cDNA and L1 insert generation in cultured cells. Consistent with the latter, we observe that tumor specific L1 inserts are shorter in endometrial, ovarian, and prostate tumors with higher TRIM28 mRNA expression than in those with lower TRIM28 expression. We determine that three amino acids in the B box domain that are involved in TRIM28 multimerization are critical for its effect on both L1 retrotransposition and cDNA synthesis. We provide evidence that B boxes from the other two members in the Class VI TRIM proteins, TRIM24 and TRIM33, also increase L1 retrotransposition.

These BM are intimately correlated with the stability of the tumour microenvironment.  Purpose:   This study aspires to uncover the metabolism-related genes and the underlying mechanisms responsible for bone metastatic prostate cancer (BMPCa).  Methods:   Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets of PCa and BM were analyzed through R Studio software to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The DEGs underwent functional enrichment via Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO), with key factors screened by a random forest utilized to establish a prognostic model for PCa. The study explored the relationship between DEGs and the stability of the immune microenvironment. The action and specificity of CRISP3 in PCa was validated through western blot analysis, CCK-8 assay, scratch assay, and cellular assay.  Results:   The screening of GEO and TCGA datasets resulted in the identification of 199 co-differential genes. Three DEGs, including DES, HBB, and SLPI, were selected by random forest classification model and cox regression model. Immuno-infiltration analysis disclosed that a higher infiltration of naïve B cells and resting CD4 memory T cells occurred in the high-expression group of DES, whereas infiltration of resting M1 macrophages and NK cells was greater in the low-expression group of DES. A significant infiltration of neutrophils was observed in the high-expression group of HBB, while greater infiltration of gamma delta T cells and M1 macrophages was noted in the low-expression group of HBB. Resting dendritic cells, CD8 T cells, and resting T regulatory cells (Tregs) infiltrated significantly in the high-expression group of SLPI, while only resting mast cells infiltrated significantly in the low-expression group of SLPI. CRISP3 was established as a critical gene in BMPCa linked to DES expression. Targeting CRISP3, d-glucopyranose may impact tumour prognosis. During the mechanistic experiments, it was established that CRISP3 can advance the proliferation and metastatic potential of PCa by advancing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).  Conclusion:   By modulating lipid metabolism and maintaining immunological and microenvironmental balance, DES, HBB, and SLPI suppress prostate cancer cell growth. The presence of DES-associated CRISP3 is a harbinger of unfavorable outcomes in prostate cancer and may escalate tumor proliferation and metastatic capabilities by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition.""","""['Qingfu Zhang#', 'Peng Zhang#', 'Zhongting Zhao', 'Jun Wang', 'Hepeng Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PeerJ""","""['Prognostic signatures associated with high infiltration of Tregs in bone metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Analysis of genomics and immune infiltration patterns of epithelial-mesenchymal transition related to metastatic breast cancer to bone.', 'Molecular mechanisms, immune cell infiltration, and potential drugs for prostate cancer.', 'MicroRNA-regulated transcriptome analysis identifies four major subtypes with prognostic and therapeutic implications in prostate cancer.', 'Identify potential prognostic indicators and tumor-infiltrating immune cells in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.']"""

Identifying the molecular mechanisms which navigate the neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) of PCa cells is clinically relevant. It has been suggested that the micro RNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of intrinsic mechanisms relevant to tumor progression, resistance as a result leads to poor prognosis. miR-147b has been transpiring as one of the deregulated miRNAs associated with the occurrence of multiple cancers. The present study has studied the role of miRNA-147b in inducing NEPC.  Methods:   To investigate the functional role of miR-147b in NEPC, we have expressed miRNA mimics or inhibitors in PCa cells and monitored the progression of NEPC along with PCa cell proliferation and survival. The molecular mechanism miRNA-147b follows was studied using western blot and reverse transcription polymerase chain analysis. miRNA target prediction using bioinformatics tools followed by target validation using luciferase reporter assays was performed.  Results:   In the present study, we found that miR-147b is highly expressed in AIPC cell lines in particular neuroendocrine cells NCI-H660 and NE-LNCaP derived from LNCaP. Mechanistic studies revealed that overexpression of miR-147b or miRNA mimics induced NED in LNCaP cells in in-vitro while its inhibitor reversed the NE features (increased NE markers and reduced prostate specific antigen) of PC3, NCI-H660 and NE-LNCaP cells. In addition, miR-147b reduced the proliferation rate of LNCaP cells via elevated p27kip1 and lowered cyclin D1 for promoting differentiation. In reporter assays, we have identified ribosomal protein S15A (RPS15A) is a direct target of miRNA-147b and RPS15A expression was negatively regulated by miR-147b in PCa cells.

In this study, we evaluate the accuracy and reliability of PV measured by TAUS and MRI.  Methods:   A total of 106 patients who underwent TAUS and MRI prior to radical prostatectomy were retrospectively analyzed. The TAUS-based and MRI-based PV were calculated using the ellipsoid formula. The specimen volume measured by the water-displacement method was used as a reference standard. Correlation analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were performed to compare different measurement methods and Bland Altman plots were drawn to assess the agreement.  Results:   There was a high degree of correlation and agreement between the specimen volume and PV measured with TAUS (r = 0.838, p < 0.01; ICC = 0.83) and MRI (r = 0.914, p < 0.01; ICC = 0.90). TAUS overestimated specimen volume by 2.4ml, but the difference was independent of specimen volume (p = 0.19). MRI underestimated specimen volume by 1.7ml, the direction and magnitude of the difference varied with specimen volume (p < 0.01). The percentage error of PV measured by TAUS and MRI was within ± 20% in 65/106(61%) and 87/106(82%), respectively. In patients with PV greater than 50 ml, MRI volume still correlated strongly with specimen volume (r = 0.837, p < 0.01), while TAUS volume showed only moderate correlation with specimen (r = 0.665, p < 0.01) or MRI volume (r = 0.678, p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   This study demonstrated that PV measured by MRI and TAUS is highly correlated and reliable with the specimen volume. MRI might be a more appropriate choice for measuring the large prostate.""","""['Shikuan Guo#', 'Jingliang Zhang#', 'Jianhua Jiao#', 'Zeyu Li', 'Peng Wu', 'Yuming Jing', 'Weijun Qin#', 'Fuli Wang#', 'Shuaijun Ma#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Accuracy of Clarius, Handheld Wireless Point-of-Care Ultrasound, in Evaluating Prostate Morphology and Volume Compared to Radical Prostatectomy Specimen Weight: Is There a Difference between Transabdominal vs Transrectal Approach?', 'The Comparison of Imaging and Clinical Methods to Estimate Prostate Volume: A Single-Centre Retrospective Study.', 'Determination of Prostate Volume: A Comparison of Contemporary Methods.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Value of Different Magnetic Resonance Imaging-based Measurements of Anatomical Structures on Preoperative Prostate Imaging in Predicting Urinary Continence After Radical Prostatectomy in Men with Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

With this goal in mind, several model training approaches were compared: removing unstable features according to the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); training independently with features extracted from each radiologist's mask; training with the feature average between both radiologists; extracting radiomic features from the intersection or union of masks; and creating a heterogeneous dataset by randomly selecting one of the radiologists' masks for each patient. The classifier trained with this last resampled dataset presented with the lowest generalization error, suggesting that training with heterogeneous data leads to the development of the most robust classifiers. On the contrary, removing features with low ICC resulted in the highest generalization error. The selected radiomics dataset, with the randomly chosen radiologists, was concatenated with deep features extracted from neural networks trained to segment the whole prostate.

For patients with advanced stage prostate cancer, immunotherapies are a promising approach when standard treatment options have been exhausted. With the rapid emergence of NK cell-based therapies, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which NK cells can be triggered to kill cancer cells that have developed immune-evasive strategies. Altering the cytokine profiles of advanced prostate cancer cells may be an area to explore when considering ways in which NK cell activation can be modulated. We have previously demonstrated that combining the cytokine, IL-27, with TLR3 agonist, poly(I:C), changes cytokine secretion in the advanced prostate cancer models, PC3 and DU145 cells. Herein, we extend our previous work to study the effect of primary human NK cells on prostate cancer cell death in an in vitro co-culture model. Stimulating PC3 and DU145 cells with IL-27 and poly(I:C) induced IFN-β secretion, which was required for activation of primary human NK cells to kill these stimulated prostate cancer cells. PC3 cells were more sensitized to NK cell-mediated killing when compared to DU145 cells, which was attributed to differential levels of IFN-β produced in response to stimulation with IL-27 and poly(I:C). IFN-β increased granzyme B secretion and membrane-bound TRAIL expression by co-cultured NK cells. We further demonstrated that these NK cells killed PC3 cells in a partially TRAIL-dependent manner.

Considering the advantage that the cathode and anode poles of the bipolar electrode (BPE) can be modified respectively, this work was carried out using anode equipped with ECL reagent bipyridine ruthenium (Ru(bpy)32+), and cathode equipped with the Fe-doped molybdenum oxide/Au nanoparticles (FeMoOv/AuNPs) with excellent peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT)-like activity. Because FeMoOv/AuNPs show efficient enzyme catalysis eﬀect and can greatly promote the decomposition of H2O2, thus the electron transfer rate in the NM-BPE system would be much accelerated to enhance the ECL signal of Ru(bpy)32+. Based on this principle, this work not only realized sensitive detection of H2O2, but also ingeniously designed an sandwich immunosensor using FeMoOv/AuNPs as recognition probe to mediate the ECL response on the anode, achieving highly sensitive detection of PSA. Furthermore, a unique mobile phone ECL imaging system was developed for assay of PSA at different concentrations, which opened a new portable imaging sensing device for bioassays. This work was the first time to combine nanozymes with bipolar electrodes for ECL analysis and imaging, which not only broadened the applications of nanozymes, but also pioneered the new joint ECL research technique of bipolar electrode and ECL imaging in bioassays, showing great application prospect for multiple detection of proteins, nucleic acids and cancer cells.""","""['Hongkun Li', 'Qianqian Cai', 'Jianru Wang', 'Guifen Jie']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biosens Bioelectron""","""['Insights into the Mechanism of Bipolar Electrodeposition of Au Films and Its Application in Visual Detection of Prostate Specific Antigens.', 'Visual electrochemiluminescence ratiometry on bipolar electrode for bioanalysis.', 'Bipolar electrode-electrochemiluminescence (ECL) biosensor based on a hybridization chain reaction.', 'Gold nanoparticle-based signal amplified electrochemiluminescence for biosensing applications.', 'Paper-based bipolar electrode electrochemiluminescence sensors for point-of-care testing.']"""

Many PC cases metastasize and develop resistance to systemic hormonal therapy, a stage known as castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective therapeutic strategies for CRPC. Traditional drug discovery pipelines require significant time and capital input, which highlights a need for novel methods to evaluate the repositioning potential of existing drugs. Here, we present a computational framework to predict drug sensitivities of clinical CRPC tumors to various existing compounds and identify treatment options with high potential for clinical impact. We applied this method to a CRPC patient cohort and nominated drugs to combat resistance to hormonal therapies including abiraterone and enzalutamide. The utility of this method was demonstrated by nomination of multiple drugs that are currently undergoing clinical trials for CRPC. Additionally, this method identified the tetracycline derivative COL-3, for which we validated higher efficacy in an isogenic cell line model of enzalutamide-resistant vs. enzalutamide-sensitive CRPC. In enzalutamide-resistant CRPC cells, COL-3 displayed higher activity for inhibiting cell growth and migration, and for inducing G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of a computational framework for independent validation of drugs being tested in CRPC clinical trials, and for nominating drugs with enhanced biological activity in models of enzalutamide-resistant CRPC. The efficiency of this method relative to traditional drug development approaches indicates a high potential for accelerating drug development for CRPC.""","""['Weijie Zhang', 'Adam M Lee', 'Sampreeti Jena', 'Yingbo Huang', 'Yeung Ho', 'Kiel T Tietz', 'Conor R Miller', 'Mei-Chi Su', 'Joshua Mentzer', 'Alexander L Ling', 'Yingming Li', 'Scott M Dehm', 'R Stephanie Huang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['Lycopene enhances the sensitivity of castration-resistant prostate cancer to enzalutamide through the AKT/EZH2/ androgen receptor signaling pathway.', 'Inhibition of noncanonical Wnt pathway overcomes enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Natural product myricetin is a pan-KDM4 inhibitor which with poly lactic-co-glycolic acid formulation effectively targets castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Enzalutamide: targeting the androgen signalling pathway in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'YOLOv5-FPN: A Robust Framework for Multi-Sized Cell Counting in Fluorescence Images.']"""

Its redox-dependent conformational isoform, termed oxidized MIF (oxMIF), is a promising tumor target due to its selective occurrence in tumor lesions and at inflammatory sites. A first-generation anti-oxMIF mAb, imalumab, was investigated in clinical trials in patients with advanced solid tumors, where it was well tolerated and showed signs of efficacy. However, imalumab has a short half-life in humans, increased aggregation propensity, and an unfavorable pharmacokinetic profile. Here, we aimed to optimize imalumab by improving its physicochemical characteristics and boosting its effector functions. Point mutations introduced into the variable regions reduced hydrophobicity and the antibodies' aggregation potential, and increased plasma half-life and tumor accumulation in vivo, while retaining affinity and specificity to oxMIF. The introduction of mutations into the Fc region known to increase antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity resulted in enhanced effector functions of the novel antibodies in vitro, whereas reduced cytokine release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in the absence of target antigen by the engineered anti-oxMIF mAb ON203 versus imalumab reveals a favorable in vitro safety profile.

Experiments with three PC cell lines, the 22Rv1, DU145, and PC3 were conducted focusing on the inducibility of PD-L1 by hypoxia, acidity, lymphocyte interactions, and radiation.

Weighted multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic and Cox proportional hazards (mortality) models were conducted.  Results:   We found an inverse association between use of weight loss medications and incident PCa (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.57-0.62), CRC (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.80-0.92), and HRCs (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.62-0.68).

Effects of weight loss medications on PCa and HRC remained significant irrespective of the use of TTh but were only suggestive with CRC with positive TTh use. No associations were observed with male breast cancer and HRCs mortality.  Conclusion:   Pre-diagnostic use of weight loss medications reduced the incidence of PCa, CRC, and HRCs.

Cancer death rates overall declined by 1.4% per year from 2000 to 2015, accelerating to 2.3% per year during 2016 to 2019, driven by strong declines in lung cancer mortality (-4.7%/year, 2014 to 2019). Recent declines in colorectal (-2.0%/year, 2010-2019) and breast cancer death rates (-1.2%/year, 2013-2019) also contributed. However, trends for other cancer types were less promising. To achieve the Moonshot goal, progress against lung, colorectal, and breast cancer deaths needs to be maintained and/or accelerated, and new strategies for prostate, liver, pancreatic, and other cancers are needed. We reviewed opportunities to prevent, detect, and treat these common cancers that could further reduce population-level cancer death rates and also reduce disparities.

However, due to increasing drug resistance, studies on the discovery of new sources are needed. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the inhibition effects of four native Acanthamoeba strains on different cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, PC3, MAT-LyLu). 3T3 cells were used as normal cell line. All strains were recultured by using non-nutrient agar spread by heat-inactivated Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. A.castellanii ATCC 50373 was used as the standard strain. Molecular identification of the native Acanthamoeba isolates was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis using specific primer pairs (P-FLA-F, P-FLA-R, JDP-F, JDP-R). Axenic cultures of all strains were obtained in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks and in peptone yeast extract glucose (PYG) medium. In order to investigate the effect of cell-free supernatants obtained from axenic cultures on cancer cell lines and 3T3 cell viability, MTT method was applied using different concentrations of cell-free supernatants (1%, 2%, 5%, 10%, 15%). It was determined that the viability of 3T3 cells was not affected by any Acanthamoeba cell-free supernatants (p≤ 0.05). All of the samples tested were found to have a significant inhibitory effect (p<0.05) on the viability of PC3 and MAT-LyLu cells (human and rat prostate cancer cell line). However, none of the samples had an inhibitory effect on the viability of MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cell-line). Two native Acanthamoeba cell-free supernatants showed higher inhibitory potency (28% and 21.9%) at 2% concentration against PC3 cells compared to the reference strain (16%). Similarly, the same Acanthamoeba samples were also shown to have a better inhibition potential on the viability of MAT-LyLu cells than the reference strain. It was found that the inhibitory potential of Acanthamoeba cell-free supernatants may not be related to proteins and proteases.

NEPC is characterized by the loss of androgen receptor (AR) signaling and transdifferentiation toward small-cell neuroendocrine (SCN) phenotypes, which results in resistance to AR-targeted therapy. NEPC resembles other SCN carcinomas clinically, histologically and in gene expression. Here, we leveraged SCN phenotype scores of various cancer cell lines and gene depletion screens from the Cancer Dependency Map (DepMap) to identify vulnerabilities in NEPC. We discovered ZBTB7A, a transcription factor, as a candidate promoting the progression of NEPC. Cancer cells with high SCN phenotype scores showed a strong dependency on RET kinase activity with a high correlation between RET and ZBTB7A dependencies in these cells. Utilizing informatic modeling of whole transcriptome sequencing data from patient samples, we identified distinct gene networking patterns of ZBTB7A in NEPC versus prostate adenocarcinoma. Specifically, we observed a robust association of ZBTB7A with genes promoting cell cycle progression, including apoptosis regulating genes. Silencing ZBTB7A in a NEPC cell line confirmed the dependency on ZBTB7A for cell growth via suppression of the G1/S transition in the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis.

Using the UK Biobank population-based cohort, we developed and validated a simple model comprising age, family history, and a polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict 5-year risk of prostate cancer.  Methods:   Eligible participants were unaffected Caucasian men aged 40-69 years at their baseline assessment who had genotyping data available and had completed 6 or more weeks of follow-up. Family history was the number of affected first-degree relatives: 0, 1, or 2+. We used 264 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of a previously developed 269-SNP PRS and population standardized the PRS to have a mean of 1. Age was categorized into 10-year groups: 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69. In a 70% training data set, we used Cox regression with age as the time axis to model family history, PRS, and age group. The model estimates were used with prostate cancer incidences to derive 5-year risks of prostate cancer. Using 5 years of follow-up in a 30% testing data set, the model was tested in terms of its association per quintile of risk, discrimination, and calibration.  Results:   Of the 198 334 eligible participants, 8996 (4.5%) were diagnosed with incident prostate cancer during follow-up and had a mean age of 67.9 (SD = 5.8) years at diagnosis. The best-fitting model included the PRS, family history, 10-year age group, interactions between age and PRS, and age and family history. In the 30% testing data set with follow-up limited to 5 years, the hazard ratio per SD of 5-year risk was 3.058 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.720-3.438) and the Harrell's C-index was 0.811 (95% CI, 0.800-0.821). Overall, there were 1088 observed and 1159.1 expected prostate cancers, a standardized incidence ratio of 0.939 (95% CI, 0.885-0.996).  Conclusions:   Men at increased risk of prostate cancer could benefit from informed discussions around the risks and benefits of available options for screening for prostate cancer.

The instrument measures the dynamic stiffness of the palpable surface of the prostate, and has been trialled on 12 patients in vivo. The patients had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and were scheduled for radical prostatectomy. As far as possible, patients with asymmetric disease were chosen so as to give a variation in gland condition over the palpable surface. The device works by applying an oscillating pressure (force) to a flexible probe whose displacement into the tissue is also measured in order to yield a dynamic stiffness, the static stiffness being incidentally measured at the mean oscillatory force. The device was deployed mounted on the index finger of a urologist and measurements taken at 12-16 positions on each patient using light and firm pressure and palpation frequencies of 1 or 5 Hz. In parallel, conventional DRE assessments were made by a consultant urologist for cancer. After in vivo measurement, the glands were removed and examined histologically with each palpation point being classified as cancerous (C) or not (NC). The work has established the first measurements of static modulus of living prostate tissue to be: 26.8 (13.3) kPa for tissue affected by prostate cancer (C classification), and 24.8 kPa (11.9) for tissue unaffected by cancer (NC classification), values quoted as median (interquartile range). The dynamic properties were characterised by: dynamic modulus, 5.15 kPa (4.86) for the C classification and 4.61 kPa (3.08) for the NC classification and the time lag between force and displacement at 5 Hz palpation frequency, 0.0175 s (0.0078) for the C classification and 0.0186 s (0.0397) for the NC classification, values again quoted as median (interquartile range). With the limited set of features that could be generated, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classification yielded a sensitivity of 97%, negative predictive value of 86%, positive predictive value of 67% and accuracy of 70% but with relatively poor specificity (30%). Besides extending the feature set, there are a number of changes in probe design, probing strategy and in mechanics analysis, which are expected to improve the diagnostic capabilities of the method.""","""['Robert L Reuben', 'Steven J Hammer', 'Olufemi Johnson', 'Daniel W Good', 'Javier Palacio-Torralba', 'Antonio Candito', 'Yuhang Chen', 'Simon Phipps', 'Will Shu', 'S Alan McNeill']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Proc Inst Mech Eng H""","""['Quantitative mechanical assessment of the whole prostate gland ex vivo using dynamic instrumented palpation.', 'Dynamic instrumented palpation - a new method for soft tissue quality assessment: application to prostate disease diagnosis.', 'Robotic palpation-based mechanical property mapping for diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Comparison of digital rectal examination and biopsy results with the radical prostatectomy specimen.']"""

Steroidal and non-steroidal AR antagonists can significantly improve the survival of PCa patients by blocking the action of the endogenous ligand through binding to the hormone receptor and preventing its activation. Herein, we report two synthetic strategies, each utilizing the advantages of microwave irradiation, to modify the A-ring of natural androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) with pyridine scaffolds. Treatment of DHT with appropriate Mannich salts led to 1,5-diketones, which were then converted with hydroxylamine to A-ring-fused 6'-substituted pyridines. To extend the compound library with 4',6'-disubstituted analogues, 2-arylidene derivatives of DHT were subjected to ring closure reactions according to the Kröhnke's pyridine synthesis. The crystal structure of a monosubstituted pyridine product was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction. AR transcriptional activity in a reporter cell line was investigated for all novel A-ring-fused pyridines and a number of previously synthesized DHT-based quinolines were included to the biological study to obtain information about the structure-activity relationship. It was shown that several A-ring-fused quinolines acted as AR antagonists, in comparison with the dual or agonist character of the majority of A-ring-fused pyridines. Derivative 1d (A-ring-fused 6'-methoxyquinoline) was studied in detail and showed to be a low-micromolar AR antagonist (IC50 = 10.5 µM), and it suppressed the viability and proliferation of AR-positive PCa cell lines. Moreover, the candidate compound blocked the AR downstream signalling, induced moderate cell-cycle arrest and showed to bind recombinant AR and to target AR in cells.

Methods:   ExPeCT (Exercise, Prostate Cancer and Circulating Tumour Cells), was a multi-centre randomised control trial with a 6-month aerobic exercise intervention arm or a standard care control arm. Exercise adherence data was collected via heart rate monitors. Quality of life (FACT-P) and physical activity (self-administered questionnaire) assessments were completed at baseline, at 3 months and at 6 months.  Results:   A total of 61 patients were included (69.4 ± 7.3 yr, body mass index 29.2 ± 5.8 kg/m2). The median time since diagnosis was 34 months (IQR 7-54). A total of 35 (55%) of participants had > 1 region affected by metastatic disease. No adverse events were reported by participants. There was no effect of exercise on quality of life (Cohen's d = - 0.082). Overall adherence to the supervised sessions was 83% (329 out of 396 possible sessions attended by participants). Overall adherence to the non-supervised home exercise sessions was 72% (months 1-3) and 67% (months 3-6).

Intriguingly, AR regulates cytoplasmic isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), but not its mitochondrial counterparts IDH2 and IDH3. Here, we aimed to understand the functional role of IDH1 in PCa. Mouse models, in vitro human PCa cell lines, and human patient-derived organoids (PDOs) were used to study the expression and activity of IDH enzymes in the normal prostate and PCa. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of IDH1 was then combined with extracellular flux analyses and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for metabolomic analyses and cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In PCa cells, more than 90% of the total IDH activity is mediated through IDH1 rather than its mitochondrial counterparts. This profile seems to originate from the specialized prostate metabolic program, as observed using mouse prostate and PDOs. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of IDH1 impaired mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that this cytoplasmic enzyme contributes to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) in PCa. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics confirmed this hypothesis, showing that inhibition of IDH1 impairs carbon flux into the TCA cycle. Consequently, inhibition of IDH1 decreased PCa cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrate that PCa cells have a hybrid cytoplasmic-mitochondrial TCA cycle that depends on IDH1.

Methods:   We retrospectively analysed male patients (≥50 years old) without prior prostate cancer history, who underwent unenhanced pelvic CT between April 2010 and March 2011, and followed-up until December 2021.

Results:   A total of 636 male patients (mean age, 68 years ± 9 [standard deviation]) were evaluated.

Methods:   Twenty prostate patients with repeated CT simulation imaging were included.

Then, delivered dose to bladder was estimated using ≥4 CBCTs to measure number of fractions with major bladderdose violation (>5% difference) for both plans. Bladder heights of fractions without major bladder dose violations were compared to those with a violation to determine a threshold height for bladder filling acceptability.  Results:   Using the ""Accepted"" bladder plans for treatment resulted in 30/175 fractions with major dose violations. These 30 bladders were significantly shorter than those without major violation (mean 28 vs 43mm, p < 0.05).

Percentiles for 262,639 PSA observations in healthy men aged 18-70 years were calculated and plotted to elucidate the normal fluctuation range for PSA values by age. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to develop a predictive model for prostate cancer incidence. PSA levels and PSA velocity increased with age in healthy men. However, there was no difference in PSA velocity with age in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Logistic regression analysis showed an increased risk of prostate cancer for PSA slopes ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 ng/mL/year. This study provides age-specific normal fluctuation ranges for PSA levels in men aged 18-75 years and presents a novel and personalized prediction model for prostate cancer incidence.

Objective:   Bone biomarkers in HSPC were prospectively evaluated as part of a phase 3 study of androgen deprivation therapy ± the CYP17 inhibitor orteronel.  Design, setting, and participants:   Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 316) and validation (n = 633) sets. Recursive partitioning and Cox proportional hazard models were employed.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Bone resorption (C-telopeptide and pyridinoline) and bone formation markers (C-terminal collagen propeptide and bone alkaline phosphatase) were assessed from patient sera.  Results and limitations:   Of 1279 men, 949 had evaluable baseline bone biomarkers. Optimal cutoffs were identified to define elevated levels of each of the four biomarkers (all p < 0.05) that were associated with worse OS. After adjusting for clinical risk factors in the validation set, elevated bone biomarkers were statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratios ranging from 1.37 to 1.92). Recursive partitioning algorithms applied to the training set identified three risk groups (low, intermediate, and poor) with differential OS outcomes (median OS: 8.2, 5.1, and 2.1 yr, respectively) based on combinations of bone biomarkers. These results were confirmed in the validation set.  Conclusions:   In men with HSPC initiating androgen deprivation therapy, bone biomarkers are strongly and independently prognostic for OS. Bone biomarker levels alone or in combination with clinical covariates identify unique subsets of men with differential OS outcomes. These results validate the clinical value of bone biomarker assessment in the HSPC state, extending bone biomarker utility beyond the castration-resistant state.  Patient summary:   In men with newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer, high levels of bone turnover biomarkers are associated with a shorter lifespan.""","""['Primo N Lara Jr', 'Edward Mayerson', 'Erik Gertz', 'Catherine Tangen', 'Amir Goldkorn', 'Marta van Loan', 'Maha Hussain', 'Shilpa Gupta', 'Jingsong Zhang', 'Mamta Parikh', 'Przemyslaw Twardowski', 'David I Quinn', 'Michael LeBlanc', 'Nicholas J Vogelzang', 'Ian Thompson', 'Neeraj Agarwal']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol""","""['Bone turnover biomarkers identify unique prognostic risk groups in men with castration resistant prostate cancer and skeletal metastases: Results from SWOG S0421.', 'Prognostic Factors for Survival in Noncastrate Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Validation of the Glass Model and Development of a Novel Simplified Prognostic Model.', 'Serum biomarkers of bone metabolism in castration-resistant prostate cancer patients with skeletal metastases: results from SWOG 0421.', 'The cytoreductive prostatectomy in metastatic prostate cancer: what the individual trials are hoping to answer.', 'Targeting Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer: Chemohormonal Therapy and New Combinatorial Approaches.']"""

Materials and methods:   The clinical data and ADC parameters of 229 PC patients were retrospectively evaluated. Pre-treatment and post-treatment serum PSA and primary tumor ADC values were calculated. Post-treatment DW-MRI was performed median 4.1 months after completion of definitive RT. The prognostic factors predicting freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using univariable and multivariable analyses.  Results:   With a median follow-up time of 80.8 months, the 5-year FFBF and PFS rates were 95.9% and 89.3%, respectively. Eleven patients (4.8%) had PSA relapse, with a median of 34.4 months after the completion of RT.

Resolution of this conflict through enhancing translation elongation speed enables the efficient and precise synthesis of a network of poised mRNAs resulting in uncontrolled proliferation, clonogenic growth, and bladder cancer progression. We observe a similar phenomenon in patients with ARID1A-low tumors, which also exhibit increased translation elongation activity through eEF2. These findings have important clinical implications because ARID1A-deficient, but not ARID1A-proficient, tumors are sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of protein synthesis.

Methods:   A conversation analysis of twenty-eight prostate cancer treatment and diagnostic consultations was carried out using data collected from four clinical sites across England.  Results:   The analysis demonstrated that this practice was prosocial and patient enabling. Partners oriented to the patient's primary rights to take their turn as the selected next speaker, only initiating after a substantial delay from the clinician's turn-at-talk. Consequently, the partner consistently opened an opportunity space that the patient took to elaborate upon, or collaborate with the partners' turn as they regularly took up a unified stance resisting the individualised configuration of the encounter.  Conclusion:   This research highlights the social and clinical utility of partners during these consultations, as they served as important, yet underutilised interactional and informational resources for clinicians and patients.

In cancer type, colorectal cancer risk was lower (aHR: 0.872, P < 0.0001), whereas leukemia risk was higher (aHR: 1.402, P < 0.0001) in patients with insomnia than in those without it, regardless of sex. In men, the risk of stomach cancer was lower (aHR: 0.882, P = 0.0003), and the risks of lung (aHR:1.114, P = 0.0005), kidney (aHR 1.226, P = 0.0107), and prostate (aHR:1.101, P = 0.0028) cancers were higher in insomnia patients than in control patients. In women, insomnia patients compared to control patients showed a lower risk of ovarian cancer (aHR:0.856, P = 0.0344, respectively), while they had a higher risk of oral (aHR:1.616, P = 0.002), thyroid (aHR:1.072, P = 0.0192), and nerve (aHR: 1.251, P = 0.016) cancers.

We undertook VDR proteogenomic analyses in European American (EA) and AA prostate cell lines and four clinical cohorts. Rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous protein (RIME) analyses revealed that nonmalignant AA RC43N prostate cells displayed the greatest dynamic protein content in the VDR complex. Likewise, in AA cells, Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing established greater 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated chromatin accessibility, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed significant enhancer-enriched VDR cistrome, and RNA sequencing identified the largest 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent transcriptome. These VDR functions were significantly corrupted in the isogenic AA RC43T prostate cancer cells, and significantly distinct from EA cell models. We identified reduced expression of the chromatin remodeler, BAZ1A, in three AA prostate cancer cohorts as well as RC43T compared with RC43N. Restored BAZ1A expression significantly increased 1α,25(OH)2D3-regulated VDR-dependent gene expression in RC43T, but not HPr1AR or LNCaP cells. The clinical impact of VDR cistrome-transcriptome relationships were tested in three different clinical prostate cancer cohorts. Strikingly, only in AA patients with prostate cancer, the genes bound by VDR and/or associated with 1α,25(OH)2D3-dependent open chromatin (i) predicted progression from high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia to prostate cancer; (ii) responded to vitamin D3 supplementation in prostate cancer tumors; (iii) differentially responded to 25(OH)D3 serum levels. Finally, partial correlation analyses established that BAZ1A and components of the VDR complex identified by RIME significantly strengthened the correlation between VDR and target genes in AA prostate cancer only. Therefore, VDR transcriptional control is most potent in AA prostate cells and distorted through a BAZ1A-dependent control of VDR function.  Significance:   Our study identified that genomic ancestry drives the VDR complex composition, genomic distribution, and transcriptional function, and is disrupted by BAZ1A and illustrates a novel driver for AA prostate cancer.""","""['Manjunath Siddappa#', 'Shahid Hussain#', 'Sajad A Wani', 'Jason White', 'Hancong Tang', 'Jaimie S Gray', 'Hedieh Jafari', 'Hsu-Chang Wu', 'Mark D Long', 'Isra Elhussin', 'Balasubramanyam Karanam', 'Honghe Wang', 'Rebecca Morgan', 'Gary Hardiman', 'Isaacson B Adelani', 'Solomon O Rotimi', 'Adam R Murphy', 'Larisa Nonn', 'Melissa B Davis', 'Rick A Kittles', 'Chanita Hughes Halbert', 'Lara E Sucheston-Campbell', 'Clayton Yates', 'Moray J Campbell']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""['Dynamics of 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-dependent chromatin accessibility of early vitamin D receptor target genes.', 'The in vitro evaluation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 19-nor-1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 as therapeutic agents for prostate cancer.', 'Genomic and epigenomic active vitamin D responses in human colonic organoids.', 'The vitamin D hormone and its nuclear receptor: molecular actions and disease states.', 'Metabolism and Action of 25-Hydroxy-19-nor-Vitamin D₃ in Human Prostate Cells.']"""

Adverse effects of prostate cancer treatments commonly include erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and bowel dysfunction, making successful initial curative prostatectomy imperative.  Aim:   Current intraoperative tumor margin assessment is largely limited to frozen section analysis, which is a lengthy, labor-intensive process that is obtrusive to the clinical workflow within the operating room (OR). Therefore, a rapid method for prostate cancer margin assessment in the OR could improve outcomes for patients.  Approach:   Dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI), which uses paired antibody-based probes that are labeled with spectrally distinct fluorophores, was shown herein for prostate cancer margin assessment. The paired antibody-based probes consisted of a targeted probe to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and an untargeted probe, which were used as a cocktail to stain resected murine tissue specimens including prostate tumor, adipose, muscle, and normal prostate. Ratiometric images (i.e., DDSI) of the difference between targeted and untargeted probe uptake were calculated and evaluated for accuracy using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis with area under the curve values used to evaluate the utility of the DDSI method to detect PSMA positive prostate cancer.  Results:   Targeted and untargeted probe uptake was similar between the high and low PSMA expressing tumor due to nonspecific probe uptake after topical administration. The ratiometric DDSI approach showed substantial contrast difference between the PSMA positive tumors and their respective normal tissues (prostate, adipose, muscle). Furthermore, DDSI showed substantial contrast difference between the high PSMA expressing tumors and the minimally PSMA expressing tumors due to the ratiometric correction for the nonspecific uptake patterns in resected tissues.  Conclusions:   Previous work has shown that ratiometic imaging has strong predictive value for breast cancer margin status using topical administration. Translation of the ratiometric DDSI methodology herein from breast to prostate cancers demonstrates it as a robust, ratiometric technique that provides a molecularly specific imaging modality for intraoperative margin detection. Using the validated DDSI protocol on resected prostate cancers permitted rapid and accurate assessment of PSMA status as a surrogate for prostate cancer margin status. Future studies will further evaluate the utility of this technology to quantitatively characterize prostate margin status using PSMA as a biomarker.""","""['Marcus J Kwon', 'Broderick J House', 'Connor W Barth', 'Allison Solanki', 'Jocelyn A Jones', 'Scott C Davis', 'Summer L Gibbs']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biomed Opt""","""['Optimizing fresh specimen staining for rapid identification of tumor biomarkers during surgery.', 'Clinically relevant dual probe difference specimen imaging (DDSI) protocol for freshly resected breast cancer specimen staining.', 'Diagnostic performance of receptor-specific surgical specimen staining correlates with receptor expression level.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.', 'Can Negative Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Avoid the Need for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection in Newly Diagnosed Prostate Cancer Patients?

Salvage therapy for ILF includes high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can accurately detect ILF and can exclude extraprostatic disease. Lutetium-177 PSMA Radioligand Therapy (RLT) is a novel treatment for prostate cancer that can target prostate cancer accurately, while sparing radiation dose to normal tissues.  Methods:   ROADSTER is a phase I/II randomized, single-institution study. Patients with an ILF of prostate cancer after definitive initial radiation therapy are eligible. The ILF will be confirmed with biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PSMA PET. Patients will be randomized between HDR brachytherapy in two fractions (a standard of care salvage treatment at our institution) (cohort 1) or one treatment of intravenous Lutetium-177 PSMA RLT, followed by one fraction of HDR brachytherapy (cohort 2). The primary endpoints for the phase I portion of the study (n = 12) will be feasibility, defined as 10 or more patients completing the study protocol within 24 months of study activation; and safety, defined as zero or one patients in cohort 2 experiencing grade 3 or higher toxicity in the first 6 months post-treatment. If feasibility and safety are achieved, the study will expand to a phase II study (n = 30 total) where preliminary efficacy data will be evaluated. Secondary endpoints include changes in prostate specific antigen levels, acute toxicity, changes in quality of life, and changes in translational biomarkers. Translational endpoints will include interrogation of blood, urine, and tissue for markers of DNA damage and immune activation with each treatment.  Discussion:   ROADSTER explores a novel salvage therapy for ILF after primary radiotherapy with combined Lutetium-177 PSMA RLT and HDR brachytherapy. The randomized phase I/II design will provide a contemporaneous patient population treated with HDR alone to facilitate assessment of feasibility, tolerability, and biologic effects of this novel therapy.

We hypothesize that Proclarix could be correlated with PCa aggressiveness. We analyzed the association of this new biomarker with four surrogates of aggressiveness: grade group (GG) in the biopsy, clinical stage, risk of biochemical recurrence after primary treatment of localized PCa, and pathology in the surgical specimen.  Material and methods:   This is a retrospective study from 606 men with suspicion of PCa [PSA of ≥ 3.0 ng/mL and/or abnormal digital rectal examination (DRE)], in whom Proclarix was assessed (0-100%). The GG was defined by the International Society of Urological Pathology categories. The TNM was used for clinical staging (cT based on DRE, whereas cN and cM were established with computed tomography and 99-technetium bone scintigraphy). The risk of biochemical recurrence of localized PCa after primary treatment was defined by combining PSA, GG, and cT. Finally, an unfavorable pathology in a surgical specimen was defined as GG > 2 or pT ≥ 3.  Results:   The median age of the cohort was 67 years old, with a median PSA of 7 ng/mL and a rate of abnormal DRE of 23.3%. CsPCa was detected in 254 men (41.9%), with a median Proclarix of 60.1% compared with 37.3% obtained in patients with insignificant PCa and 20.7% in men without PCa. Among patients with GG > 3, Proclarix was significantly higher (58.2%) than in those with GG of 3 or lower (33.1%, p < 0.001). Men with localized tumors exhibited a Proclarix median of 37.3% compared with those with advanced disease (60.1%, p < 0.001). Proclarix levels among 197 patients with low and intermediate risk of biochemical recurrence were 24.9% and 35.0%, respectively, significantly lower compared with patients with high-risk disease (58.7%, p < 0.001). Unfavorable pathology was observed in 35 patients out of the 79 who underwent radical prostatectomy, with a Proclarix median of 35.7% compared with 23.7% obtained in patients with favorable pathology (p = 0.013).

Material and methods:   Between January 2016 and December 2020, 829 patients scheduled for intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer had an intraprostatic fiducial marker transrectal implantation under ultrasound guidance by radiation-oncologists specialized in brachytherapy. Patients received standard oral prophylactic antibiotic with quinolone. If Gram negative bacteria resistant to quinolone were detected at the time of the prostate cancer biopsies, the antibioprophylaxis regimen was modified accordingly. The resistance to quinolone screening test was not repeated before fiducial marker insertion. Infectious complications were assessed with questionnaires at the time of CT-planning and medical record reviewed. Toxicity was evaluated according to CTCAE v5.0.  Results:   The median time between fiducial marker implantation and evaluation was 10 days (range: 0-165 days). Four patients (0.48%) developed urinary tract infection related to the procedure, mostly with Gram-negative bacteria resistant to quinolone (75%). Three had a grade 2 infection, and one patient experienced a grade 3 urosepsis. The quinolone-resistance status was known for two patients (one positive and one negative) and was unknown for the other two patients prior to fiducial marker implantation.  Conclusion:   Intraprostatic transrectal fiducial marker implantation for image-guided radiotherapy is well tolerated with a low rate of infection. With such a low rate of infection, there is no need to repeat the search of Gram-negative bacteria resistant to quinolone before fiducial marker implantation if it was done at the time of prostate biopsies.

This study compared PSA90 responses by 6 months between patients with mCSPC at first use of apalutamide or abiraterone acetate, both androgen receptor signaling inhibitors.  Methods:   Clinical data from 77 community urology practices in the United States were analyzed. Patients with mCSPC were classified into treatment cohorts based on their first filled prescription (index date) for apalutamide or abiraterone acetate on or after September 17, 2019 (approval date of apalutamide for mCSPC). Patients were followed from the index date until the earliest of index treatment discontinuation, treatment switch, end of clinical activity, or end of data availability (September 17, 2021). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to ensure similarity in distribution of baseline characteristics between cohorts. PSA90 was defined as the earliest attainment of ≥90% reduction in PSA relative to baseline (most recent value within 13 weeks pre-index). Time to PSA90 between cohorts was compared by weighted Kaplan-Meier analysis and with Cox proportional hazards models.  Results:   A total of 364 patients treated with apalutamide and 147 treated with abiraterone acetate met the study criteria. Patient characteristics were well balanced after IPTW. By 6 months post-index, patients initiated on apalutamide were 53% more likely to achieve PSA90 than those initiated on abiraterone acetate (P = 0.016). Similar results were observed by 9 and 12 months post-index (both P ≤ 0.019). The median time to PSA90 was 3.5 months for the apalutamide cohort and not reached for the abiraterone acetate cohort.

Short, noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might detect more grade group ≥2 cancers with similar rates of biopsy.  Objective:   To evaluate strategies that combined PSA and MRI to select men based in the community for a prostate biopsy.  Design, setting, and participants:   IP1-PROSTAGRAM was a prospective, population-based, paired cohort study of 408 men aged 50-69 yr conducted at seven UK primary care practice and two imaging centres (from October 10, 2018 to May 15, 2019).  Intervention:   All participants underwent screening with a PSA test, MRI (T2-weighted and diffusion), and transrectal ultrasound (b-mode and elastography). If any test was screen positive, a systematic 12-core biopsy was performed. Additional image-fusion targeted biopsies were taken if the MRI or ultrasound was positive.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We conducted an analysis, set out in the statistical plan a priori, comparing 13 different pathways including PSA-alone, MRI-alone, and a range of PSA thresholds and MRI scores. The performance of each pathway was evaluated focusing on the trade-offs between biopsy referral rates and detection of grade group ≥2 cancers. A targeted biopsy was performed only where the PROSTAGRAM MRI showed a lesion score of 3, 4, or 5.  Results and limitations:   The standard PSA pathway (PSA ≥3 ng/ml + systematic biopsy) would lead to 10% of men being referred for a biopsy and a 1.0% detection rate of grade group ≥2 cancers. Pathways that relied on MRI alone set at a threshold score of 3 for a biopsy led to higher biopsy rates, but with benefit of high cancer detection rates. The pathway that combined an initial low PSA threshold (≥1.0 ng/ml) and MRI score ≥4 accurately identified a high rate of grade group ≥2 cancers (2.5%, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.6) while recommending fewer patients for a biopsy (7.1%, 95% confidence interval 4.9-10.2). The results are pertinent to only one screening round, the impact of repeat screening rounds is not evaluated, and the required MRI capacity is currently lacking.  Conclusions:   Our results highlight the trade-off that exists between reducing excessive numbers of biopsies and maintaining grade group ≥2 cancer detection rates. A pathway that combines PSA ≥1 ng/ml and MRI score ≥4 maintains the detection of grade group ≥2 cancers while recommending fewer men for biopsies and would be the preferred strategy to evaluate in future studies at the first screening round.

These choices include carcinogenic risk factors and could affect fitness to receive treatments.  Objective:   To evaluate the contemporary lifestyle choices in BC patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   Self-reported surveys from participants diagnosed with BC in the previous 10 yr captured smoking patterns, e-cigarette use, physical activity using the GODIN Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire, long-term conditions (LTCs), relationship status, sociodemographics, and body mass index (BMI; height and weight).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Findings were compared with the general population and men with prostate cancer.  Results and limitations:   Completed surveys were received from 2092 participants. Most respondents were ex-smokers (61% vs 10% current vs 29% never). The use of e-cigarettes was uncommon (9%) and at lower rates than the age-equivalent general population. Passive smoke exposure was frequent (48%). Most participants (68%) were ""insufficiently active"" using the GODIN criteria and less physically active than the age-equivalent general population. Most respondents (44%) were classified as overweight (BMI 25-29.99) or obese (22%, BMI >30). Lifestyle factors varied with age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and LTCs. Younger participants were less likely to smoke (p < 0.001), more likely to have used e-cigarettes (p < 0.001), but more likely to have had passive smoke exposure (p = 0.008). Those from less affluent areas were more likely to smoke (p < 0.001), have used e-cigarettes (p < 0.001), and have had passive smoke exposure (p = 0.02). Females were less likely to be smokers (p < 0.001) but more likely to have been exposed to passive smoke (p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Persons affected by BC often have smoking exposures and high BMI, and are insufficiently active. Rates of e-cigarette use were lower than in the general population. Efforts to improve quality of life in this cohort should include wider advocation of smoking cessation, perhaps including the use of e-cigarettes, and programmes to increase exercise and reduce BMI.

Here, this study verified that FTO inactivated the tumor-accelerating PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway to hamper PC development through regulating the downstream miR-139-5p/zinc finger protein 217 (ZNF217) axis. Through performing clinical analysis, it was revealed that FTO was apparently ablated in the cancerous tissues compared to the normal tissues collected from PC patients, and patients with high-expressed FTO predicted a favorable prognosis. Functional experiments confirmed that overexpression of FTO suppressed cell proliferation, mitosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumorigenesis and lung metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. The following mechanical experiments verified that FTO stabilized miR-139-5p to increase its expression levels in a m6A-dependent manner, and elevated miR-139-5p induced degradation of ZNF217 through binding to ZNF217 mRNA, resulting in the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal pathway. Finally, our rescuing experiments confirmed that overexpressed FTO-induced tumor-suppressing effects on PC cells were abrogated by miR-139-5p ablation and ZNF217 overexpression.

Herein, we identify groups at risk for vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis and further characterize the natural history and treatment patterns.  Materials and methods:   Years 1987-2013 of a prospectively maintained radical prostatectomy registry were queried for patients with the diagnosis of vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis, defined as symptomatic and inability to pass a 17F cystoscope. Patients with follow-up less than 1 year, preoperative anterior urethral stricture, transurethral resection of prostate, prior pelvic radiotherapy, and metastatic disease were excluded. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis. Functional outcomes were characterized.  Results:   Out of 17,904 men, 851 (4.8%) developed vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis at a median of 3.4 months. Multivariable logistic regression identified associations with vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis including adjuvant radiation, BMI, prostate volume, urine leak, blood transfusion, and nonnerve-sparing techniques. Robotic approach (OR 0.39, P < .01) and complete nerve sparing (OR 0.63, P < .01) were associated with reduced vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis formation. Vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis was independently associated with 1 or more incontinence pads/d at 1 year (OR 1.76, P < .001). Of the patients treated for vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis, 82% underwent endoscopic dilation. The 1- and 5-year vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis retreatment rates were 34% and 42%, respectively.  Conclusions:   Patient-related factors, surgical technique, and perioperative morbidity influence the risk of vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis after radical prostatectomy. Ultimately, vesicourethral anastomotic stenosis is independently associated with increased risk of urinary incontinence.

One important component of survivorship that is impacted by treatment long term is diminished quality of life (QoL). Supervised exercise improves QoL and subsequent outcomes but is not accessible for all survivors. Additionally, many factors influence QoL including physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), physical function, and fatigue. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to increase access to exercise beyond supervised exercise facilities. Home-based exercise may provide a feasible alternative for cancer survivors especially for those living in rural communities.  Objectives:   The primary aim is to investigate the effects of home-based exercise training (Pre-training vs. Post-training) on QoL in BCa/PCa. A secondary aim is to investigate PA, CRF, physical function, and fatigue and potential moderators (age, cancer-type, intervention duration and type). Home-based exercise trials (randomized crossover or quasi-experimental design) with adults (aged 18 years and over) breast or prostate cancer survivors (not currently undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment) were eligible for inclusion.  Data sources:   Electronic databases were searched (inception-December 2022) for studies which included adult BCa or PCa survivors (not currently on chemotherapy/radiation), at least measured QoL, and undergoing unsupervised, home-based exercise training.  Appraisal and synthesis methods:   Initially, 819 studies were identified, from which 17 studies (20 effects) involving 692 participants were extracted. Effect sizes were calculated as standardized mean differences (SMD). Data were pooled using a 3-level model with restricted maximum likelihood estimation. Pooled SMD was used to assess the magnitude of effect, where <0.2, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 was defined as trivial, small, moderate, and large respectively.  Results:   Home-based exercise resulted in small improvements in QoL (SMD = 0.30, 95% CI 0.01, 0.60, p = 0.042), PA (SMD = 0.49, 95% CI 0.26, 0.75, p<0.001) and CRF (SMD = 0.45, 95% CI -0.01, 0.91, p = 0.056). Physical function (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI -0.21, 0.21, p = 1.000) and fatigue (SMD = -0.61, 95%CI -1.53, 0.32, p = 0.198) did not change.  Conclusions:   Home-based exercise results in small improves QoL in BCa/PCa survivors, independent of cancer type, intervention duration and type, or age. Home-based exercise also improves PA and CRF enhancing survivorship. Therefore, home-based exercise is an efficacious alternative option to improve QoL for BCa and PCa survivors especially for those who live in rural communities or lack access to exercise facilities.""","""['Lauren C Bates-Fraser', 'Sasha Riley', 'Cameron Stopforth', 'Kaileigh Moertl', 'Kyle Edgar', 'Lee Stoner', 'Erik D Hanson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Exercise interventions on health-related quality of life for people with cancer during active treatment.', 'Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.', 'Physical activity for women with breast cancer after adjuvant therapy.', 'Exercise interventions for adults with cancer receiving radiation therapy alone.', 'Exercise training, circulating cytokine levels and immune function in cancer survivors: A meta-analysis.']"""

Objective:   To assess whether patient-reported pain relief was improved with stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) as compared with conventional external beam radiotherapy (cEBRT) for patients with 1 to 3 sites of vertebral metastases.  Design, setting, and participants:   In this randomized clinical trial, patients with 1 to 3 vertebral metastases were randomized 2:1 to the SRS or cEBRT groups. This NRG 0631 phase 3 study was performed as multi-institutional enrollment within NRG Oncology. Eligibility criteria included the following: (1) solitary vertebral metastasis, (2) 2 contiguous vertebral levels involved, or (3) maximum of 3 separate sites. Each site may involve up to 2 contiguous vertebral bodies. A total of 353 patients enrolled in the trial, and 339 patients were analyzed. This analysis includes data extracted on March 9, 2020.  Interventions:   Patients randomized to the SRS group were treated with a single dose of 16 or 18 Gy (to convert to rad, multiply by 100) given to the involved vertebral level(s) only, not including any additional spine levels. Patients assigned to cEBRT were treated with 8 Gy given to the involved vertebra plus 1 additional vertebra above and below.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary end point was patient-reported pain response defined as at least a 3-point improvement on the Numerical Rating Pain Scale (NRPS) without worsening in pain at the secondary site(s) or the use of pain medication. Secondary end points included treatment-related toxic effects, quality of life, and long-term effects on vertebral bone and spinal cord.  Results:   A total of 339 patients (mean [SD] age of SRS group vs cEBRT group, respectively, 61.9 [13.1] years vs 63.7 [11.9] years; 114 [54.5%] male in SRS group vs 70 [53.8%] male in cEBRT group) were analyzed. The baseline mean (SD) pain score at the index vertebra was 6.06 (2.61) in the SRS group and 5.88 (2.41) in the cEBRT group. The primary end point of pain response at 3 months favored cEBRT (41.3% for SRS vs 60.5% for cEBRT; difference, -19 percentage points; 95% CI, -32.9 to -5.5; 1-sided P = .99; 2-sided P = .01). Zubrod score (a measure of performance status ranging from 0 to 4, with 0 being fully functional and asymptomatic, and 4 being bedridden) was the significant factor influencing pain response. There were no differences in the proportion of acute or late adverse effects. Vertebral compression fracture at 24 months was 19.5% with SRS and 21.6% with cEBRT (P = .59). There were no spinal cord complications reported at 24 months.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial, superiority of SRS for the primary end point of patient-reported pain response at 3 months was not found, and there were no spinal cord complications at 2 years after SRS. This finding may inform further investigation of using spine radiosurgery in the setting of oligometastases, where durability of cancer control is essential.

Japanese patients treated with primary ADT for advanced prostate cancer in the KYUCOG-1401 trial were enrolled as a development set. A distinct population of advanced prostate cancer cases treated with ADT was included as a validation set. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) at 1 year and AEs including de novo diabetes mellitus (DM), arthralgia, and de novo dyslipidemia were identified in the development set by a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The SNPs associated with rPFS in the development study were then genotyped in the validation set. GWAS followed by validation identified SNPs (rs76237622 in PRR27 and rs117573572 in MTAP) that were associated with overall survival (OS) in ADT. A genetic prognostic model using these SNPs showed excellent predictive efficacy for PFS and OS in ADT. In addition, GWAS showed that several SNPs were associated with de novo DM, arthralgia, and de novo dyslipidemia in ADT.

This study evaluates whether substitution of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) density for serum PSA improves predictive performance of the clinical CAPRA model.  Methods:   Participants were diagnosed in 2000-2019 with stage T1/T2 cancer, underwent RP, with at least a 6-month follow-up. We computed standard CAPRA score using diagnostic age, Gleason grade, percent positive cores, clinical T stage, and serum PSA, and an alternate score using similar variables but substituting PSA density for PSA. We reported CAPRA categories as low (0-2), intermediate (3-5), and high (6-10) risk. Recurrence was defined as two consecutive PSA ≥ 0.2 ng/mL or receipt of salvage treatment. Life table and Kaplan-Meier analysis evaluated recurrence-free survival after prostatectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression models tested associations of standard or alternate CAPRA variables with recurrence risk. Additional models tested associations between standard or alternate CAPRA score with recurrence risk. Cox log-likelihood ratio test (-2 LOG L) assessed model accuracy.  Results:   A total of 2880 patients had median age 62 years, GG1 30% and GG2 31%, median PSA 6.5, and median PSA density 0.19. Median postoperative follow-up was 45 months. Alternate CAPRA model was associated with shifts in risk scores, with 16% of patients increasing and 7% decreasing (p < 0.01). Recurrence-free survival after RP was 75% at 5 years and 62% at 10 years. Both CAPRA component models were associated with recurrence risk after RP on Cox regression. Covariate fit statistics showed better fit for standard CAPRA model versus alternate (p < 0.01). Standard (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.55; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-1.61) and alternate (HR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.44-1.55) CAPRA scores were associated with recurrence risk, with better fit for standard model (p < 0.01).  Conclusions:   In a 2880 patient cohort followed for median 45 months after RP, alternate CAPRA model using PSA density was associated with higher biochemical recurrence (BCR) risk, but performed inferior to standard CAPRA at predicting BCR. While PSA density is an established prognostic variable in prediagnostic settings and sub-stratifying low-risk disease, it does not improve BCR model predictive accuracy when applied across a range of cancer risk.""","""['Robert Parker', 'Alexander Bell', 'Kevin Chang', 'Scott Greenberg', 'Samuel L Washington', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Peter R Carroll', 'Matthew R Cooperberg']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The University of California, San Francisco Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score: a straightforward and reliable preoperative predictor of disease recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Evaluation of biochemical recurrence-free survival after radical prostatectomy by cancer of the prostate risk assessment post-surgical (CAPRA-S) score.', 'Predictors of biochemical recurrence in pT3b prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy.', 'External validation of the UCSF-CAPRA (University of California, San Francisco, Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment) in Japanese patients receiving radical prostatectomy.', 'Prognostic Value of Biochemical Recurrence Following Treatment with Curative Intent for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.']"""

Importantly, MRI-TBx missed 4.9% (7/143) of csPC-A and only 0.7% (1/143) of csPC-B. On the other hand, SBx alone missed 13.3% (19/143) of csPC-A and 4.2% (6/143) of csPC-B.  Conclusion:   MRI-TBx significantly outperformed 12-cores SBx for csPC detection and decreased non-csPC detection in biopsy-naive men. Performing MRI-TBx without SBx would have missed some csPC, supporting that MRI-TBx synergizes with SBx to increase csPC detection.""","""['Leandro Blas', 'Masaki Shiota', 'Shigehiro Tsukahara', 'Shunsuke Goto', 'Fumio Kinoshita', 'Takashi Matsumoto', 'Keisuke Monji', 'Eiji Kashiwagi', 'Junichi Inokuchi', 'Masatoshi Eto']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Urol""","""['Evaluation of the optimal strategy in men with a single unilateral suspicious lesion on MRI undergoing transperineal MRI/ultrasound fusion prostate biopsy.', 'Using Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) Scores to Select an Optimal Prostate Biopsy Method: A Secondary Analysis of the Trio Study.', 'Detection of clinically significant prostate cancer in biopsy-naïve men: direct comparison of systematic biopsy, multiparametric MRI- and contrast-ultrasound-dispersion imaging-targeted biopsy.', 'Diagnostic Performance of a Magnetic Resonance Imaging-directed Targeted plus Regional Biopsy Approach in Prostate Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.', 'Magnetic resonance imaging-targeted biopsy may enhance the diagnostic accuracy of significant prostate cancer detection compared to standard transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

The development and testing of tools to automatically detect contouring errors require a source of contours that includes well-understood and realistic errors. The purpose of this work was to develop a simulation algorithm that intentionally injects errors of varying magnitudes into clinically accepted contours and produces realistic contours with different levels of variability.  Methods:   We used a dataset of CT scans from 14 prostate cancer patients with clinician-drawn contours of the regions of interest (ROI) of the prostate, bladder, and rectum. Using our newly developed Parametric Delineation Uncertainties Contouring (PDUC) model, we automatically generated alternative, realistic contours. The PDUC model consists of the contrast-based DU generator and a 3D smoothing layer. The DU generator transforms contours (deformation, contraction, and/or expansion) as a function of image contrast. The generated contours undergo 3D smoothing to obtain a realistic look. After model building, the first batch of auto-generated contours was reviewed. Editing feedback from the reviews was then used in a filtering model for the auto-selection of clinically acceptable (minor-editing) DU contours.  Results:   Overall, C values of 5 and 50 consistently produced high proportions of minor-editing contours across all ROI compared to the other C values (0.936 ± $ \pm \;$ 0.111 and 0.552 ± $ \pm \;$ 0.228, respectively). The model performed best on the bladder, which had the highest proportion of minor-editing contours (0.606) of the three ROI. In addition, the classification AUC for the filtering model across all three ROI is 0.724 ± $ \pm \;$ 0.109.  Discussion:   The proposed methodology and subsequent results are promising and could have a great impact on treatment planning by generating mathematically simulated alternative structures that are clinically relevant and realistic enough (i.e., similar to clinician-drawn contours) to be used in quality control of radiation therapy.""","""['Vi Ly', 'Lizhong Liu', 'Carlos Cardenas', 'Sean Maroongroge', 'Brian De', 'Daniel El Basha', 'Laurence Court', 'Xi Luo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Appl Clin Med Phys""","""['Clinical Evaluation of Deep Learning and Atlas-Based Auto-Contouring of Bladder and Rectum for Prostate Radiation Therapy.', 'Evaluating the clinical acceptability of deep learning contours of prostate and organs-at-risk in an automated prostate treatment planning process.', 'Automatic detection of contouring errors using convolutional neural networks.', 'AAR-RT - A system for auto-contouring organs at risk on CT images for radiation therapy planning: Principles, design, and large-scale evaluation on head-and-neck and thoracic cancer cases.', 'A review of automatic lung tumour segmentation in the era of 4DCT.']"""

The presence of multi-organ metastases and tumor heterogeneity often leads to unsatisfactory outcomes of conventional radiotherapy treatments. This study aimed to develop a novel folate-targeted nanohydroxyapatite (nHA) coupling to deliver adriamycin (Doxorubicin, DOX), 32P, and 99mTc simultaneously for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positive prostate cancer.  Methods:   The spherical nHA was prepared by the biomimetic method and characterized. Folic acid (FA) was coupled to nHA with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the grafting ratio of PEG-nHA and FA-PEG-nHA was determined by the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) method. In addition, 32P, 99mTc, and DOX were loaded on nHA by physisorption. And the labeling rate and stability of radionuclides were measured by a γ-counter. The loading and release of DOX at different pH were determined by the dialysis method. Targeting of FA-PEG-nHA loaded with 99mTc was verified by in vivo SPECT imaging. In vitro anti-tumor effect of 32P/DOX-FA-PEG-nHA was assessed with apoptosis assay. The safety of the nano-drugs was verified by histopathological analysis.  Results:   The SEM images showed that the synthesized nHA was spherical with uniform particle size (average diameter of about 100nm). The grafting ratio is about 10% for PEG and about 20% for FA. The drug loading and the delayed release of DOX at different pH confirmed its long-term therapeutic ability. The labeling of 32P and 99mTc was stable and the labeling rate was great. SPECT showed that FA-PEG-nHA showed well in vivo tumor targeting and less damage to normal tissues.  Conclusion:   FA-targeted nHA loaded with 32P, 99mTc, and DOX may be a new diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for targeting PSMA-positive prostate cancer tumors, which may achieve better therapeutic results while circumventing the severe toxic side effects of conventional chemotherapeutic agents.""","""['Hao Deng#', 'Yumei Wang#', 'Yue Zhou#', 'Dongliang Zhai', 'Jie Chen', 'Shilei Hao', 'Xiaoliang Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Multi-functional nanocarriers based on iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated with doxorubicin, poly(ethylene glycol) and folic acid as theranostics for cancer therapy.', 'Targeted delivery of Doxorubicin by folic acid-decorated dual functional nanocarrier.', 'Folic acid-conjugated polyethylene glycol-coated magnetic nanoparticles for doxorubicin delivery in cancer chemotherapy: Preparation, characterization and cytotoxicity on HeLa cell line.', 'Folic acid-modified Prussian blue/polydopamine nanoparticles as an MRI agent for use in targeted chemo/photothermal therapy.', 'Breast Tumor Targeting with PAMAM-PEG-5FU-99mTc As a New Therapeutic Nanocomplex: In In-vitro and In-vivo studies.']"""

PARP7 has been shown to affect gene expression in prostate cancer cells and certain other cell types by mechanisms that include transcription factor ADP-ribosylation. Here, we use a recently developed catalytic inhibitor to PARP7, RBN2397, to study the effects of PARP7 inhibition in androgen receptor (AR)-positive and AR-negative prostate cancer cells. We find that RBN2397 has nanomolar potency for inhibiting androgen-induced ADP-ribosylation of the AR. RBN2397 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture when cells are treated with ligands that activate the AR, or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and induce PARP7 expression. We show that the growth-inhibitory effects of RBN2397 are distinct from its enhancement of IFN signaling recently shown to promote tumor immunogenicity. RBN2397 treatment also induces trapping of PARP7 in a detergent-resistant fraction within the nucleus, which is reminiscent of how inhibitors such as talazoparib affect PARP1 compartmentalization. Because PARP7 is expressed in AR-negative metastatic tumors and RBN2397 can affect cancer cells through multiple mechanisms, PARP7 may be an actionable target in advanced prostate cancer.  Significance:   RBN2397 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP7 that reduces the growth of prostate cancer cells, including a model for treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer. RBN2397 induces PARP7 trapping on chromatin, suggesting its mechanism of action might be similar to clinically used PARP1 inhibitors.""","""['Chunsong Yang', 'Krzysztof Wierbiłowicz', 'Natalia M Dworak', 'Song Yi Bae', 'Sachi B Tengse', 'Nicki Abianeh', 'Justin M Drake', 'Tarek Abbas', 'Aakrosh Ratan', 'David Wotton', 'Bryce M Paschal']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""['PARP7 mono-ADP-ribosylates the agonist conformation of the androgen receptor in the nucleus.', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation of PARP7 Protein Stability Is Controlled by Androgen Signaling.', 'Androgen signaling uses a writer and a reader of ADP-ribosylation to regulate protein complex assembly.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Medicinal chemistry approaches of poly ADP-Ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitors as anticancer agents - A recent update.']"""

General fatigue is a major adverse event after commencing of enzalutamide in CRPC patients; however, its precise impact remains uncertain, especially on the duration of enzalutamide therapy. This study evaluated the relationship of general fatigue with patient age and enzalutamide treatment duration using real-world clinical data. (Patients and methods) This investigation retrospectively included patients who received enzalutamide therapy for CRPC between 2014 and 2018 at Shinshu University School of Medicine or Nagano Municipal Hospital. We classified the patients into the general fatigue group and the non-general fatigue group, and analyzed the groups in with regard to age and the duration of enzalutamide treatment. (Results) Of the 98 patients with CRPC were enrolled, 40 (40.8%) complained of general fatigue after enzalutamide induction. The median age of the study group was 78.0 years (71.0 years in the general fatigue group and 75.0 years in the non-general fatigue group), with no significant difference between the groups. Mean treatment duration was also comparable at 265.9 days in the general fatigue group and 266.5 days in the non-general fatigue group.

Methods:   A cross-sectional study surveyed levels of stigma, anxiety and depression, QoL, and uncertainty in illness in 263 people diagnosed with prostate cancer from the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The main study variables were analyzed by structural equation modeling.  Results:   Anxiety and depression were significantly negatively related to QoL, with a standardized regression coefficient (β=-0.312, S.E. =0.478, p < 0.05), which means that participants reporting higher levels of anxiety reported decreased levels of QoL.

Material and methods:   Thirty-seven prostate SBRT patients were employed in this study. A Foley catheter was employed in nine of them, and a guide-wire was employed in the other 28 patients. For each of the 28 patients in which the guide-wire was employed, a comparison between urethral positions in both situations was performed, allowing for a margin definition of the urethra when a Foley catheter was employed. Displacements of the prostate during treatment were obtained, allowing for an analysis of prostate positions in both situations. Also, different treatment parameters such as the number of treatment interruptions, couch movements performed, and x-rays needed were gathered.  Results:   Large differences between urethral positions can be found in the anterior-posterior (AP) directions compared to those in the lateral (LAT) direction. Differences are also larger in areas closer to the base of the prostate, where margins applied in the case of using a Foley catheter are 16 mm with a mean displacement of 6 mm in the posterior direction. No differences in the treatment parameters were found during treatment in both situations. The difference found in absolute prostate pitch rotations suggests that the Foley catheter provokes a shift of the prostate position, which does not occur when employing the guide-wire.

The potential application, however, is limited by the instability of RNA molecules. The presented proof-of-principle study evaluates the potential of using synthetic chemically modified miR molecules as anticancer drugs.

Results:   All variants of synthetic modified miR-1 could be transfected into PC cells and were detectable by RT-PCR. Depending on the chemical modification, but especially on the position of the modification, the growth inhibitory activity of synthetic modified miR-1 was increased compared to synthetic unmodified miR-1.  Conclusion:   Synthetic miR-1 can be enhanced in its biological activity by modification of the C2'-OH group.

Results:   A total of 24 001 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.1 [9.4] years; 3522 women [15%], 19 845 White patients [83%], 17 896 living in urban areas [75%]) received major urologic cancer surgery between Q1 of 2016 and Q2 of 2021. Of these, 4896 radical nephrectomy, 3508 partial nephrectomy, 13 327 radical prostatectomy, and 2270 radical cystectomy surgical procedures were performed. There were no statistically significant differences in patient age, sex, race, ethnicity, insurance status, urban or rural status, or Elixhauser Comorbidity Index scores between patients who received surgery before and patients who received surgery during the pandemic. For partial nephrectomy, a baseline of 168 surgeries per quarter decreased to 137 surgeries per quarter in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. For radical prostatectomy, a baseline of 644 surgeries per quarter decreased to 527 surgeries per quarter in Q2 and Q3 of 2020. However, the likelihood of receiving radical nephrectomy (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78-1.28), partial nephrectomy (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.77-1.27), radical prostatectomy (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.22-3.22), or radical cystectomy (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.31-1.53) was unchanged. Length of stay for partial nephrectomy decreased from baseline by a mean of 0.7 days (95% CI, -1.2 to -0.2 days) during the pandemic.  Conclusions and relevance:   This cohort study suggests that partial nephrectomy and radical prostatectomy surgical volume decreased during the peak waves of COVID-19, as did postoperative length of stay for partial nephrectomy.""","""['Brian Chun', 'Haleh Ramian', 'Cameron Jones', 'Robin Vasan', 'Jonathan G Yabes', 'Benjamin J Davies', 'Lindsay M Sabik', 'Bruce L Jacobs']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""['Surgical complications associated with robotic urologic procedures in elderly patients.', 'Hospital-level variation in the quality of urologic cancer surgery.', 'Assessing the Burden of Nondeferrable Major Uro-oncologic Surgery to Guide Prioritisation Strategies During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Insights from Three Italian High-volume Referral Centres.', 'Identification of underserved areas for urologic cancer care.', 'Relationship of surgeon/hospital volume with outcomes in uro-oncology surgery.']"""

The goal of this study is to develop an optimal Evans blue-modified radiotherapeutic agent that could maximize the absolute tumor uptake and tumor absorbed dose thus the therapeutic efficacy to allow treatment of tumors even with moderate level of PSMA expression.  Methods:   [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003 was synthesized based on PSMA-targeting agent and Evans blue. Binding affinity and PSMA targeting specificity were verified through cell uptake and competition binding assay in 22Rv1 tumor model that has moderate level of PSMA expression. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice were performed to evaluate the preclinical pharmacokinetics. Radioligand therapy studies were conducted to systematically assess the therapeutic effect of [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003.  Results:   LNC1003 showed high binding affinity (IC50 = 10.77 nM) to PSMA in vitro, which was comparable with that of PSMA-617 (IC50 = 27.49 nM) and EB-PSMA-617 (IC50 = 7.91 nM). SPECT imaging of [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003 demonstrated significantly improved tumor uptake and retention as compared with [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617, making it suitable for prostate cancer therapy. Biodistribution studies further confirmed the remarkably higher tumor uptake of [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003 (138.87 ± 26.53%ID/g) over [177Lu]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 (29.89 ± 8.86%ID/g) and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 (4.28 ± 0.25%ID/g) at 24 h post-injection. Targeted radioligand therapy results showed noteworthy inhibition of 22Rv1 tumor growth after administration of a single dose of 18.5 MBq [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003. There was no obvious antitumor effect after [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment under the same condition.  Conclusion:   In this study, [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003 was successfully synthesized with high radiochemical purity and stability. High binding affinity and PSMA targeting specificity were identified in vitro and in vivo. With greatly enhanced tumor uptake and retention, [177Lu]Lu-LNC1003 has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy using significantly lower dosages and less cycles of 177Lu that promises clinical translation to treat prostate cancer with various levels of PSMA expression.""","""['Xuejun Wen#', 'Pengfei Xu#', 'Xinying Zeng#', 'Jia Liu', 'Chao Du', 'Xueyuan Zeng', 'Xingxing Cheng', 'Xueqi Wang', 'Yuanyuan Liang', 'Tianzhi Zhao', 'Hongzhang Yang', 'Huifeng Li', 'Lingxin Meng', 'Jianyang Fang', 'Hongwu Liu', 'Zijian Zhou', 'Jingjing Zhang', 'Xianzhong Zhang', 'Zhide Guo', 'Xiaoyuan Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging""","""['177Lu-Labeled Albumin-Binder-Conjugated PSMA-Targeting Agents with Extremely High Tumor Uptake and Enhanced Tumor-to-Kidney Absorbed Dose Ratio.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 theranostic probe for hepatocellular carcinoma imaging and therapy.', 'Evans blue-modified radiolabeled fibroblast activation protein inhibitor as long-acting cancer therapeutics.', 'Single Low-Dose Injection of Evans Blue Modified PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy Eliminates Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Positive Tumors.', 'Preclinical Development of Novel PSMA-Targeting Radioligands: Modulation of Albumin-Binding Properties To Improve Prostate Cancer Therapy.']"""

Methods:   All 61 cases were selected from the C-RARP and RS-RARP by propensity score matching, and the pad scale, 24-h pad weight test, and International consultation on incontinence questionnaire-short form (ICIQ-SF) were followed-up over time up to 12 months.  Results:   The probability of urinary continence per pad scale evaluation differed according to how it was defined: the continence rate 12 months after C-RARP and RS-RARP were 94% and 95% for 1 pad/day, 85% and 92% for 1 security pad/day, 61% and 85% for no pad use, respectively, which were all significantly better with RS-RARP. The results of the 24-h pad weight test were significantly better with RS-RARP at both 3 and 12 months, with median C-RARP versus RS-RARP values of 5 versus 1 g and 2 versus 0 g, respectively. In terms of types of urinary incontinence, the rates of postoperative stress urinary incontinence (SUI) increased in both procedures but to a lesser extent in RS-RARP. Other types of urinary incontinence, such as urge incontinence and terminal dribbling, did not differ significantly before and after surgery and between the two procedures.  Conclusions:   Postoperative urinary continence was better with RS-RARP than with C-RARP per all follow-up parameters until 12 months postoperatively.

We sought to revisit the question in a larger study population with more contemporary patients. We hypothesized that time from diagnosis to treatment would not differ by race, even after accounting for active surveillance (AS) and the exclusion of men at very low to low risk of PC progression.  Methods:   We analyzed data from 5885 men undergoing RP from 1988 to 2017 at eight Veterans Affairs Hospitals from SEARCH. Multiple linear regression was used to compare time from biopsy to RP and to examine the risk of delays (>90 and >180 days) between races. In sensitivity analyses we excluded men deemed to have initially chosen AS based on having >365 days from biopsy to RP and men at very low to low PC risk for progression according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines.

Methods:   Tissue microarray consisting of prostate cancer (PCa), normal prostate, and lymph node metastatic samples from patients with PCa were stained with Yin Yang 1 (YY1) and CD163. Transgenic mice overexpressing YY1 were constructed to observe PCa tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro experiments, including CRISPR-Cas9 knock-out, RNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, and liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) assays, were performed to investigate the role and mechanism of YY1 in M2 macrophages and PCa tumor microenvironment.  Results:   YY1 was highly expressed in M2 macrophages in PCa and was associated with poorer clinical outcomes. The proportion of tumor-infiltrated M2 macrophages increased in transgenic mice overexpressing YY1. In contrast, the proliferation and activity of anti-tumoral T lymphocytes were suppressed. Treatment targeting YY1 on M2 macrophages using an M2-targeting peptide-modified liposome carrier suppressed PCa cell lung metastasis and generated synergistic anti-tumoral effects with PD-1 blockade. IL-4/STAT6 pathway regulated YY1, and YY1 increased the macrophage-induced PCa progression by upregulating IL-6. Furthermore, by conducting H3K27ac-ChIP-seq in M2 macrophages and THP-1, we found that thousands of enhancers were gained during M2 macrophage polarization, and these M2-specific enhancers were enriched in YY1 ChIP-seq signals. In addition, an M2-specific IL-6 enhancer upregulated IL-6 expression through long-range chromatin interaction with IL-6 promoter in M2 macrophages. During M2 macrophage polarization, YY1 formed an LLPS, in which p300, p65, and CEBPB acted as transcriptional cofactors.

The objective of the present study was to determine the minimum number of monitoring days required for reliable estimates of different PA intensities in cancer survivors when using a six-days protocol. Furthermore, reliability of monitoring days was assessed stratified on sex, age, cancer type, weight status, and educational level.  Methods:   Data was obtained from two studies where PA was monitored for seven days using the SenseWear Armband Mini in a total of 984 cancer survivors diagnosed with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. Participants with ≥22 hours monitor wear-time for six days were included in the reliability analysis (n = 736). The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and the Spearman Brown prophecy formula were used to assess the reliability of different number of monitoring days.  Results:   For time in light PA, two monitoring days resulted in reliable estimates (ICC >0.80). Participants with BMI ≥25, low-medium education, colorectal cancer, or age ≥60 years required one additional monitoring day. For moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA, three monitoring days yielded reliable estimates. Participants with BMI ≥25 or breast cancer required one additional monitoring day. Vigorous PA showed the largest within subject variations and reliable estimates were not obtained for the sample as a whole. However, reliable estimates were obtained for breast cancer survivors (4 days), females, BMI ≥30, and age <60 years (6 days).

Secondary analysis will additionally explore multiple patient and oncological prognostic factors of potential importance, along with the cumulative incidence of these outcomes, symptom trajectory and their association with subsequent functional and social outcomes.  Conclusion:   This cohort study aims to add to the existing limited literature evaluating significant prognostic factors for multiple mental wellbeing outcomes in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients. This may be of potential use for guiding future prognosis research and of clinical use for identifying individuals potentially requiring additional surveillance or support during routine cancer follow up.

However, the high rate of false-negative biopsies often leads to inappropriate treatment. Therefore, new molecular biomarkers, such as urine microRNAs (miRNAs), are a possible way to redefine PCa diagnostics.  Patients and methods:   Urine samples of 356 patients undergoing prostate biopsy (256 cases with confirmed prostate cancer, 100 cases with negative prostate biopsy) at the Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (Czech Republic) and additional 36 control subjects (healthy controls, benign prostatic hyperplasia - BPH) were divided into the discovery and validation cohorts and analyzed. In the discovery phase, small RNA sequencing was performed using the QIAseq miRNA Library Kit and the NextSeq 500 platform. Identified miRNA candidates were validated by the RT-qPCR method in the independent validation phase.  Results:   Using the small RNA sequencing method, we identified 12 urine miRNAs significantly dysregulated between PCa patients and controls. Furthermore, independent validation showed the ability of miR-501-3p and the quantitative miR-335:miR-501 ratio to distinguish between PCa patients and patients with negative prostate biopsy. The subsequent combination of the miR-335:miR-501 ratio with PSA and total prostate volume (TPV) using logistic regression exceeded the analytical accuracy of standalone parameters [area under curve (AUC)=0.75, positive predictive value (PPV)=0.85, negative predictive value (NPV)=0.51)] and discriminated patients according to biopsy outcome.

Because of its specificity, PSMA is a major target of prostate cancer therapy; however, detectable levels of PSMA are also found in other tissues, especially in salivary glands and kidney, generating bystander damage of these tissues. Antibody target therapy has been used with relative success in reducing tumor growth and prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. However, since antibodies are highly stable in plasma, they have prolonged time in circulation and accumulate in organs with an affinity for antibodies such as bone marrow. For that reason, a second generation of PSMA targeted therapeutic agents has been developed. Small molecules and minibodies have had promising clinical trial results, but concerns about their specificity had arisen with side effects due to accumulation in salivary glands and kidneys. Herein we study the specificity of small molecules and minibodies that are currently being clinically tested. We observed a high affinity of these molecules for PSMA in prostate, kidney and salivary gland, suggesting that their effect is not prostate specific.

The radioresistance and radiosensitivity of cancer cells may depend less on the number of cells in a colony and more on the way cells interact to form complex networks. In this study, we have examined whether the topology of 2D cancer-cell graphs is influenced by ionizing radiation. We subjected different cancer cell lines, i.e. H4 epithelial neuroglioma cells, H460 lung cancer cells, PC3 bone metastasis of grade IV of prostate cancer and T24 urinary bladder cancer cells, cultured on planar surfaces, to increasing photon radiation levels up to 6 Gy. Fluorescence images of samples were then processed to determine the topological parameters of the cell-graphs developing over time. We found that the larger the dose, the less uniform the distribution of cells on the substrate-evidenced by high values of small-world coefficient (cc), high values of clustering coefficient (cc), and small values of characteristic path length (cpl).

However, the understanding of the role of androgen in PCa-infiltrated immune cells and the impact of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), the first-line treatment for advanced PCa, on the PCa immune microenvironment remains limited. On the other hand, immune checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the treatment of certain cancer types, but fails to achieve any benefit in advanced PCa, due to an immune suppressive environment. In this study, it is reported that AR signaling pathway is evidently activated in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) of PCa both in mice and humans. AR acts as a transcriptional repressor for IL1B in TAMs. ADT releases the restraint of AR on IL1B and therefore leads to an excessive expression and secretion of IL-1β in TAMs. IL-1β induces myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accumulation that inhibits the activation of cytotoxic T cells, leading to the immune suppressive microenvironment.

A long-term complication is bladder neck contracture (BNC). The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for BNC formation after TURP.  Methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of all TURP primary procedures which were performed at one academic institution between 2013 and 2018. All patients were analyzed and compared with regard to postoperative formation of a BNC requiring further therapy. Uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses (MVAs) were performed to identify possible risk factors for BNC development.  Results:   We included 1368 patients in this analysis. Out of these, 88 patients (6.4%) developed BNC requiring further surgical therapy. The following factors showed a statistically significant association with BNC development: smaller preoperative prostate volume (p = 0.001), lower resected prostate weight (p = 0.004), lower preoperative levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA, p < 0.001), shorter duration of the surgery (p = 0.027), secondary transurethral intervention (due to urinary retention or gross hematuria) during inpatient stay (p = 0.018), positive (≥100 CFU/mL) preoperative urine culture (p = 0.010), and urethral stricture (US) formation requiring direct visual internal urethrotomy (DVIU) postoperatively after TURP (p < 0.001), in particular membranous (p = 0.046) and bulbar (p < 0.001) strictures. Preoperative antibiotic treatment showed a protective effect (p = 0.042). Histopathological findings of prostate cancer (PCA) in the resected prostate tissue were more frequent among patients who did not develop BNC (p = 0.049). On MVA, smaller preoperative prostate volume (p = 0.046), positive preoperative urine culture (p = 0.021), and US requiring DVIU after TURP (p < 0.001) were identified as independent predictors for BNC development.

Nevertheless, the function of DDX49 in prostate cancer (PCa) is unknown. This study reveals the prognostic and predictive value of DDX49 in PCa.  Methods:   First, we evaluated the expression of DDX49 between PCa and normal tissues based on TCGA and GEO databases. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to reveal the risk factors for PCa recurrence. A K-M curve was employed to assess the relationship between DDX49 and recurrence-free survival. In vitro, DDX49 expression was evaluated in PCa and normal prostate cell lines. Furthermore, we constructed a shDDX49 lentivirus to knock down the expression of DDX49. Celigo® Image Cytometer and MTT assay were performed to analyse cell proliferation in PC-3 cells. Cell cycle distribution was detected with flow cytometry analysis. Apoptosis affected by the lack of DDX49 was metred with the PathScan® Stress and Apoptosis Signalling Antibody Array Kit.  Results:   This study shows a high increase in DDX49 in PCa tissues in comparison with normal tissues and that increased DDX49 indicates a poor prognosis among PCa patients. Meanwhile, DDX49 knockdown suppressed the proliferation and migration of PC-3 cells, causing cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Stress and apoptosis pathway analysis revealed that the phosphorylation of HSP27, p53, and SAPK/JNK was reduced in the DDX49 knockdown group compared with the control group.  Conclusions:   In summary, these results suggest that high expression of DDX49 predicts a poor prognosis among PCa patients. Downregulation of DDX49 can suppress cell proliferation, block the cell cycle, and facilitate cell apoptosis.

Outcomes:   The main outcome measures were the spouses' psychological recovery (psychological symptoms at the initial survey vs currently) and well-being/QOL (depressive symptoms, domains of QOL) at 5 years. We analysed their predictors with regression analyses.  Results:   The treatment had been prostatectomy in 70% of the patients. Psychological distress had alleviated in 76% of spouses (p<0.001) and emotional changes decreased (p=0.02), but a deteriorating impact on the partnership (from 4% to 16%) and on sex life ('strong impact' from 23% to 37%) had increased.

STAD was 6 months of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist/antagonist therapy plus antiandrogen. RT modalities were external-beam RT alone to 79.2 Gy or external beam (45 Gy) with brachytherapy boost. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM), non-PCSM, distant metastases (DMs), PSA failure, and rates of salvage therapy.  Results:   Median follow-up was 6.3 years. Two hundred nineteen deaths occurred, 119 in arm 1 and 100 in arm 2. Five-year OS estimates were 90% versus 91%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.11]; P = .22). STAD resulted in reduced PSA failure (HR, 0.52; P <.001), DM (HR, 0.25; P <.001), PCSM (HR, 0.10; P = .007), and salvage therapy use (HR, 0.62; P = .025). Other-cause deaths were not significantly different (P = .56). Acute grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs) occurred in 2% of patients in arm 1 and in 12% for arm 2 (P <.001). Cumulative incidence of late grade ≥3 AEs was 14% in arm 1 and 15% in arm 2 (P = .29).  Conclusion:   STAD did not improve OS rates for men with IRPC treated with dose-escalated RT. Improvements in metastases rates, prostate cancer deaths, and PSA failures should be weighed against the risk of adverse events and the impact of STAD on quality of life.""","""['Daniel J Krauss', 'Theodore Karrison', 'Alvaro A Martinez', 'Gerard Morton', 'Di Yan', 'Deborah Watkins Bruner', 'Benjamin Movsas', 'Mohamed Elshaikh', 'Deborah Citrin', 'Bruce Hershatter', 'Jeff M Michalski', 'Jason Alexander Efstathiou', 'Adam Currey', 'Vivek S Kavadi', 'Fabio L Cury', 'Michael Lock', 'Adam Raben', 'Samantha Andrews Seaward', 'Ali El-Gayed', 'Joseph P Rodgers', 'Howard M Sandler']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Clin Oncol""","""['The need for androgen deprivation therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated external beam radiation therapy.', 'Short-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy versus intermediate-term androgen suppression and radiotherapy, with or without zoledronic acid, in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (TROG 03.04 RADAR): 10-year results from a randomised, phase 3, factorial trial.', 'High-dose radiotherapy and risk-adapted androgen deprivation in localised prostate cancer (DART 01/05): 10-year results of a phase 3 randomised, controlled trial.', 'A systematic overview of radiation therapy effects in prostate cancer.', 'Preliminary toxicity and prostate-specific antigen response of a Phase I/II trial of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, 103Pd brachytherapy, and three-dimensional conformal external beam irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer.', 'Dose-Escalated Radiation Alone or in Combination With Short-Term Total Androgen Suppression for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Patient-Reported Outcomes From NRG/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 0815 Randomized Trial.']"""

Methods:   A population-based cohort of 1382 individuals with newly diagnosed prostate cancer was enrolled throughout North Carolina prior to treatment. Patients self-reported household income and were asked about the importance of 12 factors contributing to their treatment decision-making process.

Here, we report that combined EZH2/HDAC inhibitors potently kill CRPCs and cause dramatic tumor regression in aggressive human and mouse CRPC models. Notably, EZH2 and HDAC both transmit transcriptional repressive signals: regulating histone H3 methylation and histone deacetylation, respectively. Accordingly, we show that suppression of both EZH2 and HDAC are required to derepress/induce a subset of EZH2 targets, by promoting the sequential demethylation and acetylation of histone H3. Moreover, we find that the induction of one of these targets, ATF3, which is a broad stress response gene, is critical for the therapeutic response. Importantly, in human tumors, low ATF3 levels are associated with decreased survival. Moreover, EZH2- and ATF3-mediated transcriptional programs inversely correlate and are most highly/lowly expressed in advanced disease. Together, these studies identify a promising therapeutic strategy for CRPC and suggest that these two major epigenetic regulators buffer prostate cancers from a lethal response to cellular stresses, thereby conferring a tractable therapeutic vulnerability.""","""['Amy E Schade', 'Ryan Kuzmickas', 'Carrie L Rodriguez', 'Kaia Mattioli', 'Miriam Enos', 'Alycia Gardner', 'Karen Cichowski']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS Biol""","""['Combining EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors to target castration-resistant prostate cancers.', 'Combining EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors to target castration-resistant prostate cancers.', 'Epigenetic Reprogramming with Antisense Oligonucleotides Enhances the Effectiveness of Androgen Receptor Inhibition in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'DNMT1-mediated epigenetic silencing of TRAF6 promotes prostate cancer tumorigenesis and metastasis by enhancing EZH2 stability.', 'Structural assembly of Polycomb group protein and Insight of EZH2 in cancer progression: A review.', 'Beyond Expression: Role of Phosphorylated Residues of EZH2 in Lineage Plasticity in Prostate Cancer.', 'Combining EZH2 and HDAC inhibitors to target castration-resistant prostate cancers.']"""

In this study, a 2D spspEPI sequence was developed for use on a preclinical 3T Bruker system and tested on in vivo mice experiments with patient-derived xenograft renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or prostate cancer tissues implanted in the kidney or liver. Compared to spspEPI sequences, CSI were found to have a broader point spread function via simulations and exhibited signal bleeding between vasculature and tumors in vivo. Parameters for the spspEPI sequence were optimized using simulations and verified with in vivo data. The expected lactate SNR and pharmacokinetic modeling accuracy increased with lower pyruvate flip angles (less than 15°), intermediate lactate flip angles (25° to 40°), and temporal resolution of 3 s. Overall SNR was also higher with coarser spatial resolution (4 mm isotropic vs. 2 mm isotropic).

In the present study, we observed the expression of PNKY in various cancer tissues, including brain, breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers. In particular, we demonstrated that lncRNA PNKY was significantly upregulated in breast tumors, especially high-grade tumors. Knock down experiments indicated that the suppression of PNKY in breast cancer cells could restrict their proliferation by promoting apoptosis, senescence, and cell cycle disruption. Moreover, the results demonstrated that PNKY may play a crucial role in the cell migration of breast cancer cells. We further found that PNKY may trigger EMT in breast cancer cells by upregulating miR-150 and restricting the expression of Zeb1 and Snail.

Darolutamide is a structurally distinct AR inhibitor with low blood-brain barrier penetration.  Objective:   We compared cerebral blood flow (CBF) in grey matter and specific regions related to cognition after darolutamide, enzalutamide, or placebo administration, using arterial spin-label magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-MRI).  Methods:   This phase I, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-period crossover study administered single doses of darolutamide, enzalutamide, or placebo to 23 healthy males (aged 18-45 years) at 6-week intervals. ASL-MRI mapped CBF 4 h post-treatment. Treatments were compared using paired t-tests.  Results:   Drug concentrations during scans confirmed similar unbound exposure of darolutamide and enzalutamide, with complete washout between treatments. A significant localized 5.2% (p = 0.01) and 5.9% (p < 0.001) CBF reduction in the temporo-occipital cortices was observed for enzalutamide versus placebo and versus darolutamide, respectively, with no significant differences for darolutamide versus placebo. Enzalutamide reduced CBF in all prespecified regions, with significant reductions versus placebo (3.9%, p = 0.045) and versus darolutamide (4.4%, p = 0.037) in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, respectively. Darolutamide showed minimal changes in CBF versus placebo in cognition-relevant regions.  Conclusions:   Darolutamide did not significantly alter CBF, consistent with its low blood-brain barrier penetration and low risk of CNS-related adverse events. A significant reduction in CBF was observed with enzalutamide.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all men aged 50+ referred to urology within our healthcare network between January 2018 and December 2021 for initial elevated PSA. Time to initial urological evaluation was categorized as timely (within 4 months of referral), late (after 4 months), or absent (no urology evaluation).

A multivariable multinomial logistic regression model was conducted to identify predictors of timely vs late vs absent urological evaluation controlling for age, referral year, household income, distance to care, and PSA at referral.  Results:   A total of 1,335 men met inclusion criteria; 589 (44.1%), 210 (15.7%), and 536 (40.1%) had timely, late, and absent urological evaluation, respectively.

As the greatest growth in implementing dispensing occurred among large groups in 2015, outcomes were measured at the practice level in 2014 (before) and 2016 (after) for dispensing and non-dispensing practices. Outcomes included the volume of men with advanced prostate cancer managed by a practice and prescriptions for abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.

Results:   In-office dispensing increased from 1% to 30% of single-specialty urology practices from 2011 to 2018, with 28 practices implementing dispensing in 2015. In 2016 compared to 2014, adjusted changes in the volume of patients with advanced prostate cancer managed by a practice were similar between non-dispensing (0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.94) and dispensing (0.93, 95% CI 0.76-1.09) practices (P = .60).

We compared the prescribing practices of urologists and medical oncologists in treating this patient population.  Methods:   The Medicare Part D Prescribers data sets were utilized to identify urologists and medical oncologists who prescribed enzalutamide and/or abiraterone from 2013 to 2019. Each physician was assigned to one of 2 groups: enzalutamide prescriber (physicians that wrote more 30-day prescriptions for enzalutamide than abiraterone) or abiraterone prescriber (opposite). We ran a generalized linear regression to determine factors influencing prescribing preference.  Results:   In 2019, 4,664 physicians met our inclusion criteria: 23.4% (1,090/4,664) urologists and 76.6% (3,574/4,664) medical oncologists. Urologists were more likely to be enzalutamide prescribers (OR 4.91, CI 4.22-5.74, P < .001) and this held in all regions. Urologists with greater than 60 prescriptions of either drug were not shown to be enzalutamide prescribers (OR 1.18, CI 0.83-1.66, P = .349); 37.9% (5,702/15,062) of abiraterone fills by urologists were for generic compared to 62.5% (57,949/92,741) of abiraterone fills by medical oncologists.

Methods:   Utilizing the AUA Quality Registry, we identified men with stress urinary incontinence utilizing International Classification of Disease codes and related procedures for stress urinary incontinence performed from 2014 to 2020 utilizing Current Procedural Terminology codes. Characteristics of the patient, surgeon, and practice were included in a multivariate analysis of predictors of management type.  Results:   We identified 139,034 men with stress urinary incontinence in the AUA Quality Registry, of whom only 3.2% underwent surgical intervention during the study period. Artificial urinary sphincter was the most common procedure with 4,287/7,706 (56%) performed, followed by urethral sling with 2,368/7,706 (31%), and lastly urethral bulking with 1,040/7,706 (13%). There was no significant change by year in volume of each procedure performed during the study period. A large proportion of urethral bulking was performed by a disproportionately small number of practices; 5 high-volume practices performed 54% of the total urethral bulking over the study period. Open surgical procedure was more likely in patients with prior radical prostatectomy, urethroplasty, or care at an academic enter. Urethral bulking was more likely in patients with a history of bladder cancer or care by a surgeon of increasing age or female gender.  Conclusions:   Utilization of artificial urinary sphincter and urethral sling now exceeds utilization of urethral bulking for male stress urinary incontinence, though some practices continue to perform a disproportionate volume of bulking.

The purpose of this study is to examine self-reported rates of undergoing cancer-specific genetic testing in patients with breast/ovarian cancer vs prostate cancer from a nationally representative sample of U.S.  Patients:   Secondary objectives include examining sources of genetic testing information and perceptions of genetic testing for both patient populations as well as the general public.  Methods:   Data from the National Cancer Institute's Health Information National Trends Survey 5, Cycle 4 were used to generate nationally representative estimates of adults living in the U.S. Our exposure of interest was patient reported cancer history categorized as having: (1) either breast or ovarian cancer, (2) prostate cancer, or (3) no history of cancer. χ2 testing was used to compare differences among categorical variables.  Results:   In a nationally representative sample of 231.7 million adults, 3.7 million adults reported a history of breast/ovarian cancer while 1.5 million patients reported a history of prostate cancer; 52.3% of patients with breast/ovarian cancer vs 1.0% with prostate cancer reported undergoing cancer-specific genetic testing (P = .001). Patients with prostate cancer were less aware of cancer-specific genetic testing than either individuals with breast/ovarian cancer or adults without a cancer history (19.7% vs 64.7% vs 35.8%, respectively; P = .003). Health care professionals were the most common source of genetic testing information for patients with breast/ovarian cancer whereas the Internet was the most common source for patients with prostate cancer.

The updated 2019 guidelines addressed the subject of genetic testing by endorsing point-of-care genetic testing and referral to genetic counseling. However, limited literature is available regarding successful implementation of a streamlined method for genetic testing. This paper explores the benefits of implementing an on-site guideline-based genetic testing process for prostate cancer patients.  Methods:   Data were retrospectively reviewed for 552 prostate cancer patients seen in a uro-oncology clinic since January 2017. Prior to September 2018 genetic testing was recommended based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, and swabs for testing were procured off-site 1 mile from the clinic (n = 78). After September 2018 genetic testing was recommended based on the Philadelphia Consensus Conference guidelines, and swabs for testing were procured at the clinic itself (n = 474).  Results:   A statistically significant increase in testing compliance was observed after the implementation of on-site, guideline-based testing. Genetic testing compliance increased from 33.3% to 98.7%. The time to receive the genetic test results was also reduced from 38 days to 21 days.  Conclusions:   The implementation of an on-site, guideline-based genetic testing model for prostate cancer patients significantly improved compliance with genetic testing to 98.7% and decreased the time to receive genetic test results by 17 days. Adopting a guideline-based model with on-site genetic testing can significantly improve the detection rate for pathogenic and actionable mutations and increase the utilization of targeted therapies.""","""['Siddharth Ramanathan', 'Andrew Korman', 'Sadhna Ramanathan', 'Howard Korman', 'Michael I Ghilezan', 'Michael Levin', 'Kirk Wojno', 'Alvaro Martinez', 'Savitha Balaraman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Pract""","""['Editorial Commentary.', 'Positive Impact of Implementing a Comprehensive Genetic Testing Protocol for Prostate Cancer Patients in a Multi-disciplinary Uro-oncology Practice.

Methods:   We used the National Cancer Database to extract a cohort of African American and White men diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2015 and surgically treated. We used 2004-2009 data to observe preexisting racial disparity in outcomes. We used 2010-2015 data to assess racial disparity in outcomes and the interaction of race and Medicaid expansion status.  Results:   Between 2004 and 2009, 179,762 men met our criteria. In this period, African American patients reported higher hazard of 30- and 90-day mortality and higher odds of 30-day readmission compared to White patients. Between 2010 and 2015, 174,985 men met our criteria. Of these 84% were White and 16% were African American. Main effects models showed that compared to White men, African American men had higher odds of 30-day mortality (OR=1.96, 95% CI = 1.46, 2.67), 90-day mortality (OR=1.40, 95% CI = 1.11, 1.77), and 30-day readmission (OR=1.28, 95% CI = 1.19, 1.38).The interactions between race and Medicaid expansion were not significant (P = .1306, .9499, and .5080, respectively).  Conclusions:   Improved access to care via Medicaid expansion may not translate into reduced racial disparity in quality-of-care outcomes in prostate cancer patients treated surgically.

Results:   Out of 127 patients, 99 were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The PFS of the sarcopenic group administered ARATs was significantly better than that of the non-sarcopenic group. Furthermore, in the multivariate analysis of PFS, sarcopenia was an independent favourable prognostic factor.

Methods:   We investigated prediagnostic markers of insulin resistance in men in four cohorts in Sweden, in relation to PCa risk (total, non-aggressive and aggressive) and PCa death using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression. The number of men, PCa cases and PCa deaths was up to 66,668, 3940 and 473 for plasma glucose and the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, and up to 3898, 586 and 102 for plasma insulin, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and leptin.  Results:   Higher HbA1c was related to a lower risk of non-aggressive PCa but no significant associations were found for insulin resistance markers with the risk of aggressive or total PCa. In PCa cases, higher glucose and TyG index were related to a higher risk of PCa death (hazard ratio [HR] per higher standard deviation, 1.22, 95% CI 1.00-1.49 and 1.24, 95% CI 1.00-1.55), which further increased when restricting the analyses to glucose and TyG index measures taken <10 years before the PCa diagnosis (HR, 1.70, 95% CI 1.09-2.70 and 1.66, 95% CI 1.12-2.51).

Cancers belonging to the same organ system often present with similar symptoms, making initial management challenging. In this study, 511 cases of cancer were recorded after the date of consultation among 61,802 randomly selected patients presenting in primary care in six European countries: a subgroup analysis of urogenital cancers was carried out in order to study variation in symptom presentation.  Methods:   Initial data capture was by completion of standardised forms containing closed questions about symptoms recorded during the consultation. The general practitioner (GP) provided follow-up data after diagnosis, based on medical record data made after the consultation. GPs also provided free text comments about the diagnostic procedure for individual patients.  Results:   The most common symptoms were mainly associated with one or two specific types of cancer: 'Macroscopic haematuria' with bladder or renal cancer (combined sensitivity 28.3%), 'Increased urinary frequency' with bladder (sensitivity 13.3%) or prostatic (sensitivity 32.1%) cancer, or to uterine body (sensitivity 14.3%) cancer, 'Unexpected genital bleeding' with uterine cancer (cervix, sensitivity 20.0%, uterine body, sensitivity 71.4%). 'Distended abdomen, bloating' had sensitivity 62.5% (based on eight cases of ovarian cancer). In ovarian cancer, increased abdominal circumference and a palpable tumour also were important diagnostic elements. Specificity for 'Macroscopic haematuria' was 99.8% (99.7-99.8). PPV > 3% was noted for 'Macroscopic haematuria' and bladder or renal cancer combined, for bladder cancer in male patients. In males aged 55-74, PPV = 7.1% for 'Macroscopic haematuria' and bladder cancer. Abdominal pain was an infrequent symptom in urogenital cancers.  Conclusions:   Most types of urogenital cancer present with rather specific symptoms. If the GP considers ovarian cancer, increased abdominal circumference should be actively determined. Several cases were clarified through the GP's clinical examination, or laboratory investigations.""","""['Knut Holtedahl', 'Lars Borgquist', 'Gé A Donker', 'Frank Buntinx', 'David Weller', 'Christine Campbell', 'Jörgen Månsson', 'Victoria Hammersley', 'Tonje Braaten', 'Ranjan Parajuli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Prim Care""","""['Symptoms and signs of colorectal cancer, with differences between proximal and distal colon cancer: a prospective cohort study of diagnostic accuracy in primary care.', 'The association between symptoms and bladder or renal tract cancer in primary care: a systematic review.', 'Does urinary cytology have a role in haematuria investigations?', 'Evaluation of diagnostic strategies for bladder cancer using computed tomography (CT) urography, flexible cystoscopy and voided urine cytology: results for 778 patients from a hospital haematuria clinic.', 'Systematic Review of the Incidence of and Risk Factors for Urothelial Cancers and Renal Cell Carcinoma Among Patients with Haematuria.']"""

Distributions of each grade group (GG) proportion over time were modelled with restricted cubic splines, separately by biopsy technique, age group and subsequent treatment method.  Results:   From 2011 to 2020, 24 308 men were diagnosed with PCa in the registry. The proportion of GG 1 disease declined from 36-23%, with commensurate rises in GG 2 (31-36%), GG 3 (14-17%) and GG 5 (9.3-14%) disease. This pattern was similar for men diagnosed by transrectal ultrasonography or transperineal biopsy.

We assessed for risk changes across the 2 methods and associations of CAPRA (by both methods) with biochemical recurrence, using unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Model discrimination and net benefit were assessed with time-dependent area under the curve and decision curve analysis, respectively.  Results:   Of 2,222 men included, 377 (17%) increased in CAPRA score with imaging-based staging (P < .01).

In this study, we develop an ensemble learning framework to reveal the potential associations between miRNAs and diseases (ELMDA). The ELMDA framework does not rely on the known associations when calculating miRNA and disease similarities and uses multi-classifiers voting to predict disease-related miRNAs. As a result, the average AUC of the ELMDA framework was 0.9229 for the HMDD v2.0 database in a fivefold cross-validation. All potential associations in the HMDD V2.0 database were predicted, and 90% of the top 50 results were verified with the updated HMDD V3.2 database.

The advent of highly sensitive molecular imaging has facilitated identification of men with limited metastatic disease burden that might be more optimally treated with metastases-directed therapy than with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The LOCATE (NCT02680041) and FALCON (NCT02578940) trials assessed the impact of 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT on the management of patients with BCR after curative-intent primary therapy. We performed a secondary analysis of LOCATE and FALCON data to characterize sites of recurrence and management decisions for BCR patients who had an intended management plan including ADT prior to undergoing 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT.  Methods:   Data from 317 LOCATE/FALCON patients who underwent 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT were analyzed and those with a prescan plan for ADT (± another treatment) were selected. 18F-Fluciclovine detection rates were determined at the patient level and for the prostate/prostate bed region, pelvic and extra-pelvic lymph nodes (LN), soft tissues, and bones. The patients' pre- and postscan treatment plans were compared and were stratified by imaging results.  Results:   A total of 146 patients had a prescan plan for ADT (60 as monotherapy and 86 in combination with another modality). 18F-Fluciclovine detected lesions in 85 of 146 (58%) patients planned for ADT. Detection rates in the prostate/bed, pelvic LN, extra-pelvic LN, soft tissues and bone were 30%, 25%, 13%, 2.1%, and 13%, respectively. Twenty-five (17%) patients had positivity confined to the prostate/bed, 21 (14%) had 18F-fluciclovine-positive pelvic LN (±prostate/bed) but no other involvement and 39 (27%) had involvement outside the prostate/bed and pelvic LN. Postscan, 93 of 146 (64%) patients had a management change, 55 (59%) of which were to abort ADT. Only 25% of the patients originally planned for ADT monotherapy still had an unaltered plan for ADT monotherapy postscan. Patients with a postscan plan for ADT monotherapy had the most disseminated disease. Disease in the prostate/bed only was most common in those whose plan was altered to abort ADT.  Conclusions: 18F-Fluciclovine-PET/CT influenced management plans for the majority of patients with a prescan plan for ADT. Plans were commonly amended to target salvage therapy for lesions identified with 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT, and consequently likely spared/delayed patients the morbidity associated with ADT.""","""['Gerald L Andriole', 'Andrew F Scarsbrook', 'Bital Savir-Baruch;LOCATE/FALCON Study Groups']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Prostate cancer recurrence in patients with negative or equivocal conventional imaging: A role for 18F-fluciclovine-PET/CT in delineating sites of recurrence and identifying patients with oligometastatic disease.', 'Effect of hormonal therapy on 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT in the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, localization of metastatic disease, and correlation with prostate-specific antigen.', '18F-Fluciclovine Positron Emission Tomography in Men With Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy and Planning to Undergo Salvage Radiation Therapy: Results from LOCATE.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PSMA-PET/CT)-guided stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy for oligometastatic prostate cancer: a single-institution experience and review of the published literature.', 'Understanding and Improving 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT Reports: A Guide for Physicians Treating Patients with Biochemical Recurrence of Prostate Cancer.']"""

A xenograft PCa model was used to examine tumor growth. Our experimental results indicated that morusin significantly attenuated the growth of PC-3 and 22Rv1 human PCa cells; moreover, morusin significantly suppressed TGF-[Formula: see text]-induced cell migration and invasion and inhibited EMT in PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells. Significantly, morusin treatment caused cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and induced cell apoptosis in PC-3 and 22Rv1 cells. Morusin also attenuated tumor growth in a xenograft murine model. The results of RNA-seq indicated that morusin regulated PCa cells through the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, while our western blot results confirmed that morusin suppressed phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, p70S6K, and downregulation of the expression of Raptor and Rictor in vitro and in vivo.

Using deep reinforcement learning guided by human knowledge, we trained the VTP to autonomously adjust relevant parameters in treatment plan optimization, similar to a human planner, to generate high-quality plans for prostate cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). This study describes the clinical implementation and evaluation of VTP.  Materials and methods:   We integrate VTP with Eclipse TPS using scripting Application Programming Interface. VTP observes dose-volume histograms of relevant structures, decides how to adjust dosimetric constraints, including doses, volumes, and weighting factors, and applies the adjustments to the TPS interface to launch the optimization engine. This process continues until a high-quality plan is achieved. We evaluated VTP's performance using the prostate SBRT case from the 2016 American Association of Medical Dosimetrist/Radiosurgery Society plan study with its plan scoring system, and compared to human-generated plans submitted to the challenge. Using the same scoring system, we also compared the plan quality of 36 prostate SBRT cases (20 planned with IMRT and 16 planned with VMAT) treated at our institution for both VTP and human-generated plans.  Results:   In the plan study case, VTP achieved a score of 142.1/150.0, ranking the third in the competition (median 134.6). For the clinical cases, VTP achieved 110.6 ± 6.5 for 20 IMRT plans and 126.2 ± 4.7 for 16 VMAT plans, similar to scores of human-generated plans with 110.4 ± 7.0 for IMRT plans and 125.4 ± 4.4 for VMAT plans.

Population-based cancer registries report incidence at least 18 months after it happens. Our goal was to make more timely estimates by using pathologically confirmed cancers (PDC) as a proxy for incidence. We compared the 2020 and 2021 PDC with the 2019 pre-pandemic baseline in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland (NI).  Methods:   Numbers of female breast (ICD-10 C50), lung (C33-34), colorectal (C18-20), gynaecological (C51-58), prostate (C61), head and neck (C00-C14, C30-32), upper gastro-intestinal (C15-16), urological (C64-68), malignant melanoma (C43), and non-melanoma skin (NMSC) (C44) cancers were counted. Multiple pairwise comparisons generated incidence rate ratios (IRR).  Results:   Data were accessible within 5 months of the pathological diagnosis date. Between 2019 and 2020, the number of pathologically confirmed malignancies (excluding NMSC) decreased by 7315 (14.1 %). Scotland experienced early monthly declines of up to 64 % (colorectal cancers, April 2020 versus April 2019). Wales experienced the greatest overall change in 2020, but Northern Ireland experienced the quickest recovery. The pandemic's effects varied by cancer type, with no significant change in lung cancer diagnoses in Wales in 2020 (IRR 0.97 (95 % CI 0.90-1.05)), followed by an increase in 2021 (IRR 1.11 (1.03-1.20).  Conclusion:   PDC are useful in reporting cancer incidence quicker than cancer registrations.

However, the role of spalt-like transcription factor 4 (SALL4) in PCa metastasis remains unclear.  Methods:   We performed RNA-sequencing to compare the mRNA expression profiles of seven localized PCa tissues and six metastatic PCa tissues. SALL4 was then identified and compared in the localized PCa and metastatic PCa. Immunohistochemical studies, qRT-PCR, and Western blot were performed to analyze the expression of SALL4 in PCa patients and cell lines. SALL4 expression and its relevance to clinical traits and prognosis were further explored in the TCGA database and in our 68 clinical samples. Subsequently, we knocked down SALL4 in DU145 and PC3 cells and performed a series of functional assays to explore the effect of SALL4 on PCa progression. Finally, protein levels of SALL4 and core components of the MAPK pathway were measured by Western blot, and cells were treated with PD0325901 to observe proliferation and metastasis.  Results:   Significantly higher expression of SALL4 was found in metastatic PCa than in localized PCa. In addition, high SALL4 expression was significantly associated with high pathological T stage, N stage, Gleason score, and poor disease-free survival in TCGA database and in our clinical samples. Functional studies indicated that knockdown of SALL4 in DU145 and PC3 inhibited proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the ERK and P38 protein phosphorylation significantly reduced after knockdown of SALL4 in DU145 and PC3, indicating the inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, the proliferation and migration ability of DU145 and PC3 cells were significantly decreased after PD0325901 treatment.

TLRs are well known to be expressed and activated in innate immune cells, such as macrophage and dendritic cells, but we and others have found that some TLRs are also functional in epithelial cells. However, the role of an epithelial TLR in prostate cancer remains elusive.  Methods:   TLR5 expression in messenger RNA and protein level in prostate cancer was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The activation of TLR5 signaling in epithelial cells was detected upon nuclear factor-κB activation by luciferase assay and western blot analysis, and proinflammatory cytokine activation by RT-qPCR. Distinguishing between the TLR5 and NLRC4 pathways, both recognizing flagellin, is determined by small interfering RNA and proinflammatory cytokine activation. The role of TLR5 in prostate cancer was analyzed by IHC and bioinformatics using a general and single-cell database.  Results:   In the present study, we show that TLR5, among other TLRs, is exceedingly expressed in human prostate cancer cells. This cancer epithelial cell TLR5 functions to activate the TLR5 signaling pathway in human prostate cancer cells, as it does with innate immune cell TLR5. The bacterial protein flagellin induces a robust immune response in prostate cancer cells in a TLR5-dependent but NLRC4-independent manner. TLR5 is highly expressed in prostate cancer patient specimens, and high TLR5 expression in prostate cancer patients indicates a favorable prognosis.  Conclusions:   TLR5, as an innate immunity receptor, is a functional TLR in human prostate cancer epithelial cells. TLR5 plays an important role in prostate cancer development and is a new potential prognosis biomarker.

Herein, an acoustofluidic concentration of extracellular vesicles (ACEV) is presented, based on a thin-film printed circuit board with interdigital electrodes mounted on a piezoelectric substrate. An angle of 120° is identified between the electrodes and the reference flat of the piezoelectric substrate for simultaneous generation of Rayleigh and shear horizontal waves. The dual waves create a complex acoustic field in a droplet, resulting in effective concentration of nanoparticles and EVs. The ACEV is able to concentrate 20 nm nanospheres within 105 s and four EV dilutions derived from the human prostate cancer (Du145) cell line in approximately 30 s.

However, aberrant circRNA expression patterns and their biological functions in prostate cancer (PCa) warrant further studies. Our research sought to shed further light on the possible role and molecular mechanism of circEPHA3 action in controlling the growth and metastasis of PCa cells.  Materials and methods:   circEPHA3 (has_circ_0066596) was initially screened from a previous circRNA microarray and identified following Actinomycin D and RNase R assays. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, biotin-coupled probe RNA pulldown, and dual-luciferase reporter gene assays were performed to examine the relationship between circEPHA3 and miR-513a-3p. The biological role of circEPHA3 in PCa was assessed by CCK8, wound healing, Transwell assays, and animal experiments.  Results:   We identified a novel circular RNA, circEPHA3 (has_circ_0066596), which was down-regulated in high-grade PCa tissues and cell lines. The outcomes of CCK8, wound healing, Transwell assays, and animal experiments revealed that circEPHA3 prohibited the progression and metastasis of PCa in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, circEPHA3 was directly bound to miR-513a-3p and regulated the downstream gene, BMP2, thereby serving as a tumor suppressor in PCa.

Previously, we produced a bispecific construct targeting ofCS and human T cells based on VAR2CSA and anti-CD3 (V-aCD3Hu). V-aCD3Hu showed efficacy against xenografted tumors in immunocompromised mice injected with human immune cells at the tumor site. However, the complex effects potentially exerted by the immune system as a result of the treatment cannot occur in mice without an immune system. Here we investigate the efficacy of V-aCD3Mu as a monotherapy and combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors in mice with a fully functional immune system.  Methods:   We produced a bispecific construct consisting of a recombinant version of VAR2CSA coupled to an anti-murine CD3 single-chain variable fragment. Flow cytometry and ELISA were used to check cell binding capabilities and the therapeutic effect was evaluated in vitro in a killing assay. The in vivo efficacy of V-aCD3Mu was then investigated in mice with a functional immune system and established or primary syngeneic tumors in the immunologically ""cold"" 4T1 mammary carcinoma, B16-F10 malignant melanoma, the pancreatic KPC mouse model, and in the immunologically ""hot"" CT26 colon carcinoma model.  Results:   V-aCD3Mu had efficacy as a monotherapy, and the combined treatment of V-aCD3Mu and an immune checkpoint inhibitor showed enhanced effects resulting in the complete elimination of solid tumors in the 4T1, B16-F10, and CT26 models. This anti-tumor effect was abscopal and accompanied by a systemic increase in memory and activated cytotoxic and helper T cells. The combined treatment also led to a higher percentage of memory T cells in the tumor without an increase in regulatory T cells. In addition, we observed partial protection against re-challenge in a melanoma model and full protection in a breast cancer model.  Conclusions:   Our findings suggest that V-aCD3Mu combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor renders immunologically ""cold"" tumors ""hot"" and results in tumor elimination.

Methods:   Retrospective study of 3724 men who underwent RP between January 1995 and January 2015 from our prospectively collected institutional database. All men included had minimum five years follow-up and were not given androgen deprivation therapy or radiotherapy prior to BCR. Primary endpoint was time to BCR as defined by PSA > 0.2ng/ml. Patients were analysed according to Briganti Nomogram derived risk of 'low-risk' (< 5%) vs. 'high-risk' (≥ 5%). Extent of PLND was analysed using number of nodes yielded at dissection as a continuous variable as well as a categorical variable: Group 1 (limited, 1-4 nodes), Group 2 (intermediate, 5-8 nodes) and Group 3(extensive, ≥9 nodes).  Results:   Median follow-up in the overall cohort was 79.7 months and 65% of the total cohort underwent PLND.

Hormonal therapies, commonly used for PC, are associated with a range of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The population from Japan seems to be at higher risk of developing TEAEs of skin rash compared to the overall global population. This study was conducted to get a better insight into the incidence, management, and risk factors for skin rash during active treatment for advanced PC in Japan.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort of PC patients was identified and subsequently categorized, into non-metastatic and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients (nmCRPC and mCRPC), and metastatic castration-naïve prostate cancer patients (mCNPC). The analysis was based on a dataset from the Medical Data Vision (MDV) database. Descriptive statistics were determined, and a multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to the associated risk factors for the onset of rash.  Results:   Overall, 1,738 nmCRPC patients, 630 mCRPC patients, and 454 mCNPC patients were included in this analysis. The median age was 78 years old and similar across the three cohorts. The skin rash incidence was 19.97% for nmCRPC cohort, 28.89% for mCRPC cohort, and 28.85% for mCNPC cohort. The median duration of skin rash ranged from 29 to 42 days. Statistically significant risk factors for developing skin rash included a history of allergy or hypersensitivity (all cohorts), increased age (nmCRPC and mCRPC), a body mass index (BMI) of < 18.5 (nmCRPC and mCRPC), and a PSA level higher than the median (nmCRPC). Skin rash was commonly managed with systemic and topical corticosteroids which ranged from 41.76% to 67.03% for all cohorts. Antihistamines were infrequently used.  Conclusion:   This study provides a better understanding of the real-world incidence, onset, duration, management and risk factors of skin rash in patients on active PC treatment in Japan. It was observed that approximately 20-30% of PC patients experience skin rash. Development of skin rash was associated with previous allergy or hypersensitivity, BMI of < 18.5, increased age and higher PSA levels, and was usually treated with corticosteroids.""","""['Raf De Moor', 'Yosuke Koroki', 'David Bin-Chia Wu', 'Dae Young Yu', 'Mikiko Tohyama', 'Chikara Ohyama']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Skin rash following Administration of Apalutamide in Japanese patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer: an integrated analysis of the phase 3 SPARTAN and TITAN studies and a phase 1 open-label study.', 'Assessing the correlation between second progression-free survival (PFS2) and overall survival (OS) in advanced prostate cancer patients using medical data vision (MDV) claims database in Japan.', 'Efficacy, Prognostic Factors, and Safety Profile of Enzalutamide for Non-metastatic and Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Retrospective Single-Center Analysis in Japan.', 'How PET-CT is Changing the Management of Non-metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer?: Comment la TEP-TDM Peut Modifier la Prise en Charge du Cancer de la Prostate Non Métastatique Résistant à la Castration ?', 'Managing Nonmetastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

Therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical characteristics of these treated CRPC cases and their sensitivity to the currently used therapeutic agents. We aimed to examine the outcomes of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer following combined androgen blockade as initial therapy at our institution.  Methods:   Ninety-four patients who developed metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after hormonal treatment with combined nonsteroidal androgen receptor antagonists and continuous androgen deprivation therapy between January 2015 and December 2020 were included. The presence of visceral metastases, duration of efficacy of each treatment, and overall survival after castration-resistant prostate cancer were evaluated.  Results:   Patients with a longer duration of castration-resistant prostate cancer tended to have a longer response duration to subsequent enzalutamide administration (p = 0.003). Patients who achieved a 90% reduction in prostate-specific antigen levels with enzalutamide had a significantly better castration-resistant prostate cancer prognosis (p = 0.002). Meanwhile, those with visceral metastases at the time of castration-resistant prostate cancer diagnosis had a significantly poorer prognosis (p < 0.001). A positive correlation was observed between the treatment efficacy of abiraterone and taxanes for castration-resistant prostate cancer.  Conclusion:   The study provides scientific evidence to support that patients with longer time to castration-resistant prostate cancer are more sensitive to enzalutamide, and the use of abiraterone between docetaxel and cabazitaxel has favorable prognostic impact.

The purpose of our study was to explore how family FPs approach discussions with their male patients around PSA testing in Manitoba, Canada.  Design:   Qualitative descriptive study.  Setting and participants:   High-ordering and median-ordering FPs were invited to participate in an interview. In addition to exploring practice behaviours around PSA testing, participants were asked to elaborate on their typical discussion with asymptomatic men who request a PSA test or other tests and procedures that they do not feel are clinically warranted. Data were analysed inductively using a constant-comparison approach.  Results:   There were important variations between high-ordering and median-ordering FP's approaches to discussing PSA testing. Strategies to facilitate conversations were more frequently identified by median-ordering physicians and often included methods to facilitate assessing their patient's understanding and values. In addition to decision aids, median-ordering FPs used motivational interviewing to tailor a discussion, organised their practice structure and workflow habits in a way that enhanced patient-provider discussions and leveraged 'new' evidence and other aids to guide conversations with men.  Conclusion:   We found that high-ordering FPs tended to use the PSA test for screening asymptomatic men with limited shared decision-making.

In this paper, we report a direct comparison of 2 18F-labeled amino acid radiopharmaceuticals targeting system [Formula: see text], [18F]5-fluoroaminosuberic acid ([18F]FASu) and (4S)-4-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate ([18F]FSPG), in terms of their uptake specificity and ability to image glioma and lung cancer xenografts in vivo. Methods: Both tracers were synthesized according to previously published procedures. In vitro uptake specificity assays were conducted using prostate (PC-3), glioblastoma (U-87), colorectal (HT-29), ovarian (SKOV3), breast (MDA-MB-231), and lung cancer (A549) cell lines. PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in immunocompromised mice bearing U-87 or A549 xenografts. Results: In vitro cell uptake assays showed that the tracers accumulated in cancer cells in a time-dependent manner and that the uptake of [18F]FASu was blocked by the system [Formula: see text] inhibitor sulfasalazine and rose bengal, but not by system L inhibitor 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid, system [Formula: see text] inhibitor L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid, or l-serine, which is a substrate for transporter systems A, ACS, B0, and B0,+ Conversely, [18F]FSPG uptake decreased significantly in the presence of an excess of L-trans-pyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid in 2 of 3 tested cell lines, indicating some reliance on system [Formula: see text] in these cells. In an in vivo setting, [18F]FASu and [18F]FSPG generated good-contrast PET images in U-87 and A549 tumor-bearing mice. Tracer accumulation in A549 tumors was 5.0 ± 0.8 percentage injected dose (%ID)/g ([18F]FASu, n ≥ 5) and 6.3 ± 1.3 %ID/g ([18F]FSPG, n ≥ 6, P = 0.7786), whereas U-87 xenografts demonstrated uptake of 6.1 ± 2.4 %ID/g ([18F]FASu, n ≥ 4) and 11.2 ± 4.1 %ID/g ([18F]FSPG, n ≥ 4, P = 0.0321) at 1 h after injection. Conclusion: [18F]FSPG had greater in vitro uptake than [18F]FASu in all cell lines tested; however, our results indicate that residual uptake differences exist between [18F]FSPG and [18F]FASu, suggesting alternative transporter activity in the cell lines tested.

The current study evaluated the rate, clinical characteristics, and PET-based stage of elderly B(-) patients and explored whether biopsy status affects therapeutic approach. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients at least 80 y old who underwent staging 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT were included. For each patient, we documented whether preimaging biopsy was performed, the clinical parameters, the PET-based staging parameters, and the primary therapy received. Results: Thirty-four (34%) of the elderly patients included in the study had no preimaging biopsy. Compared with B(+) patients, B(-) patients were older (median age, 87 vs. 82 y; P < 0.01), with worse performance status (P < 0.01) and higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels (median, 57 vs. 15.4 ng/mL; P < 0.01). On 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, all B(-) patients had avid disease, with trends toward higher rates of bone metastases (47.1% vs. 28.8%) and overall advanced disease (50% vs. 33.3%) than in B(+) patients. Among patients with localized (n = 36) or locally advanced (n = 25) disease, B(-) patients were less commonly referred than B(+) patients for definitive therapies (P < 0.01). However, higher age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and PSA were other probable factors determining their therapeutic approach. Among 39 patients with advanced disease, 38 received hormonal therapy irrespective of their biopsy status. Among B(-) patients with advanced disease who were referred for hormonal therapy, 12 of 13 with follow-up data showed a biochemical or imaging-based response. Conclusion: Real-life experience with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT indicates that around one third of elderly patients are referred for imaging without a preimaging confirming biopsy. These patients are likely to be older, with a worse clinical status and higher PSA levels. Advanced disease might be more likely to be identified on their 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT images, and if it is, their biopsy status does not preclude them from receiving hormonal therapy.""","""['Mikhail Kesler', 'Dan Cohen', 'Charles Levine', 'David Sarid', 'Daniel Keizman', 'Ofer Yossepowitch', 'Einat Even-Sapir']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in recurrent prostate cancer: efficacy in different clinical stages of PSA failure after radical therapy.', 'Incremental Impact of 68\xa0GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT in Primary N and M Staging of Prostate Cancer Prior to Curative-Intent Surgery: a Prospective Clinical Trial in Comparison with mpMRI.', '68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography in advanced prostate cancer: Current state and future trends.', 'Current status of theranostics in prostate cancer.']"""

Methods:   Using data from clinical trials of the AKT inhibitor ipatasertib (IPAT) in the metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer setting, we trained an XGBoost ML model to predict the incidence of grade ≥2 hyperglycemia (HGLY ≥ 2). Of the 1,364 patients included in our analysis, 19.4% (n = 265) of patients had HGLY ≥2 events with a median time of first onset of 28 days (range, 0-753 days), and 30.0% (n = 221) of patients on an IPAT regimen had at least one HGLY ≥2 event compared with 7.0% (n = 44) of patients on placebo.  Results:   An 11-variable XGBoost model predicted HGLY ≥2 events well with an AUROC of 0.83 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard deviation).

Here, we attempted to reasonably stratify the patient population based on multi-parameter indicators with the aim of avoiding unnecessary SB.  Methods:   In total, 340 biopsy-naïve men with suspected lesions, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) < 20 ng/mL and prostate imaging-reporting and data system (PI-RADS) ≥ 3 enrolled for study underwent both TB and SB. The primary outcome was to determine independent predictors for a valid diagnosis, assuming that only TB was performed and SB omitted (defined as mono-TB), taking TB + SB as the reference standard. The secondary outcomes were exploration of the predictive factors of mono-TB and TB + SB in detection of prostate cancer (PCa) and clinically significant PCa (csPCa).  Results:   The mean PSA density (PSAD) of patient group was 0.27 ng/mL/mL. Multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores were 3-5 in 146 (42.94%), 105 (30.88%), and 89 (26.18%) cases, respectively.

Results:   A total of 283 patients were included in the transperineal group and 513 in the transrectal group. The analysis of a learning curve for the transperineal method showed lower complications rates comparing the first six months of TPPB procedures (group 1); The complication rate for TPPB was lower than that of TRPB (55.1% versus 81.9%, respectively; p<0.01).

Therefore, assessing response before surgery is crucial. Some LARC patients would either not benefit from intensification by TNT or may reach CR, making resection not mandatory. Treatment of LARC should therefore be based on patient individual risk and response to avoid overtreatment.The ""PRIMO"" pilot study aims to determine early response assessment to form a basis for development and validation of a noninvasive response prediction model by a subsequent prospective multicenter trial, which is highly needed for individual, response-driven therapy adaptions.  Methods:   PRIMO is a prospective observational cohort study including adult patients with LARC receiving neoadjuvant CRT. At least 4 multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI] and hypoxia-sensitive sequences) as well as repeated blood samples in order to analyze circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) are scheduled. Pelvic radiotherapy (RT, 50.4 Gy) will be performed in combination with a 5-fluorouracil/oxaliplatin regimen in all patients (planned: N = 50), succeeded by consolidation CTx (FOLFOX4) if feasible. Additional (immuno)histochemical markers, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) status will be analyzed before and after CRT. Routine resection is scheduled subsequently, nonoperative management is offered alternatively in case of clinical CR (cCR).The primary endpoint is pathological response; secondary endpoints comprise longitudinal changes in MRI as well as in CTCs and TIL. These are evaluated for early response prediction during neoadjuvant therapy, in order to develop a noninvasive response prediction model for subsequent analyses.  Discussion:   Early response assessment is the key in differentiating ""good"" and ""bad"" responders during neoadjuvant CRT, allowing adaption of subsequent therapies (additional consolidating CTx, organ preservation). This study will contribute in this regard, by advancing MR imaging and substantiating new surrogate markers.

While these centers can offer novel therapeutic options, less is known about when patients access these centers or at what timepoint in their disease course they receive specialized care. This is especially important since precision diagnostics and receipt of the optimal therapy upfront can impact patient outcomes and previous research suggests that access to these centers may vary by demographic characteristics. Here, we examine the timing of patients' presentation at Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) relative to their initial diagnosis across several demographic characteristics.  Methods:   A retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients who presented to MCC with breast, colon, lung, melanoma, and prostate cancers between December 2008 and April 2020. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained from the Moffitt Cancer Registry. The association between patient characteristics and the timing of patient presentation to MCC relative to the patient's cancer diagnosis was examined using logistic regression.  Results:   Black patients (median days = 510) had a longer time between diagnosis and presentation to MCC compared to Whites (median days = 368). Black patients were also more likely to have received their initial cancer care outside of MCC compared to White patients (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.45 [1.32-1.60]). Furthermore, Hispanics were more likely to present to MCC at an advanced stage compared to non-Hispanic patients (OR [95% CI] = 1.28 [1.05-1.55]).

This research aims at the antioxidant, antiproliferative, and apoptosis-inducing properties of Prosopis juliflora methanolic leaves extract in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. The antioxidant ability of the extract was assessed using the DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) and two additional reducing power tests. Antitumor activity was determined using MTT cell viability tests and LDH cytotoxicity assays. The probable mechanism of apoptotic cell death was further investigated utilizing a caspase-3 activation assay and qRT-PCR mRNA expression investigations of apoptotic-related genes. The results revealed that the methanol extract of Prosopis juliflora leaves contains alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, and phenols, all of which have substantial antioxidant activity. In vitro anticancer tests demonstrated that extract therapy resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in cell viability of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, but normal HaCaT cells showed no cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, plant extract therapy increased caspase-3 activation and mRNA expression of apoptotic-related genes, suggesting that this could be a mechanism for cancer cell growth suppression.

Extensive assays were conducted in this study to investigate the role of FOXP4 antisense RNA 1 (FOXP4-AS1) in PCa tumorigenesis. This study elucidated that FOXP4-AS1 expression was elevated in PCa tissue samples and cell lines. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that depleted FOXP4-AS1 inhibited PCa cell proliferation in vitro and retarded tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, FOXP4-AS1 functioned as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-3130-3p, releasing SP4 from the inhibitory effect of miR-3130-3p. Rescue assays validated that FOXP4-AS1 modulated PCa progression via SP4. Interestingly, SP4 is known as a transcription factor and was predicted to bind with the promoter region of FOXP4-AS1. This current research confirmed that SP4 activated the transcription activity of FOXP4-AS1 and thus positively regulated its expression. To conclude, we discovered that FOXP4-AS1, miR-3130-3p, and SP4 constitute a feedback loop and contribute to PCa tumorigenesis, providing a new valuable diagnosis and therapeutic strategy for PCa.""","""['Tingting Gu', 'Huafeng Pan', 'Fei Zhang', 'Li Wang', 'Zhongliang Cheng']""","""[]""","""2022""","""None""","""Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand)""","""['LncRNA FOXP4-AS1 is activated by PAX5 and promotes the growth of prostate cancer by sequestering miR-3184-5p to upregulate FOXP4.', 'Downregulation of lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 Represses Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion Through Mediating PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling by miR-342-3p/CUL4B Axis in Prostate Cancer.', 'LncRNA FOXP4-AS promotes the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by regulating the miR-3184-5p/EIF5A axis.', 'Activating transcription factor 3-activated long noncoding RNA forkhead box P4-antisense RNA 1 aggravates colorectal cancer progression by regulating microRNA-423-5p/nucleus accumbens associated 1 axis.', 'YY1-induced upregulation of FOXP4-AS1 and FOXP4 promote the proliferation of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells.']"""

Abnormal expression of CSRP1 was reported within several malignancies such as prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we explored function of CSRP1 within colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) for the first time.  Methods:   The mRNA levels of CSRP1 in COADs were obtained from TCGA datasets. CSRP1 protein expressions in COADs were tested via immunohistochemistry staining. Patients' prognosis was evaluated using both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis. Two human COAD originated cancer cell lines, Caco-2, and HT-29, were used for cellular experiments including shRNA knockdown, proliferation assay, and migration assay. In vivo model was established using nude mice xenografts to further validate the role of CSRP1 in COAD progression.  Results:   The mRNA levels of CSRP1 are elevated in COAD specimens from patients with more advanced tumor stages and higher Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) levels. In addition, higher CSRP1 mRNA level indicates worse COAD prognosis. Consistently, higher CSRP1 protein expression is correlated with worse overall survival according to both univariate and multivariate analysis, indicating that CSRP1 is a new COAD prognostic factor. Furthermore, COAD cells transfected with CSRP1-shRNAs exhibit attenuated proliferation and migration capacities. Finally, growth of xenografts originated from CSRP1-knockdown cells is inhibited comparing to the control ones.  Conclusions:   Expression of CSRP1 is positively correlated with COAD progression, which can promote tumor growth and migration.

Genetic differences likely play a role. The cBioPortal database reveals that African American men with prostate cancer have higher rates of CDK12 somatic mutations compared to Caucasian men. However, this does not account for prior prostate cancer treatments, which are particularly important in the castrate-resistant setting. We aimed to compare somatic mutations based on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) between African American and Caucasian men after exposure to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.  Methods:   This single-institution retrospective study characterizes the somatic mutations detected on ctDNA for African American and Caucasian men with mCRPC who had progressed after abiraterone and/or enzalutamide from 2015 through 2022. We evaluated the gene mutations and types of mutations in this mCRPC cohort.  Results:   There were 50 African American and 200 Caucasian men with CRPC with available ctDNA data. African American men were younger at the time of diagnosis (p = 0.008) and development of castration resistance (p = 0.006). African American men were more likely than Caucasian men to have pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in CDK12 (12% vs. 1.5%; p = 0.003) and copy number amplifications and P/LP mutations in KIT (8.0% vs. 1.5%; p = 0.031). African American men were also significantly more likely to have frameshift mutations (28% vs. 14%; p = 0.035).  Conclusions:   Compared to Caucasian men, African American men with mCRPC after exposure to abiraterone and/or enzalutamide had a higher incidence of somatic CDK12 P/LP mutations and KIT amplifications and P/LP mutations based on ctDNA.

Therefore, it is sometimes used preoperatively before flexible ureterorenoscopy to make the ureter more accessible and facilitate urolithiasis passage, especially when ureteroscopic access has failed or when the ureter is expected to be tight. However, it may cause stent-related discomfort and complications. This study aimed to assess the effect of ureteral stenting prior to retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS). Materials and Methods: Data from patients who underwent unilateral RIRS for renal stone with the use of a ureteral access sheath from January 2016 to May 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Patient characteristics, including age, sex, BMI, presence of hydronephrosis, and treated side, were recorded. Stone characteristics in terms of maximal stone length, modified Seoul National University Renal Stone Complexity score, and stone composition were evaluated. Surgical outcomes, including operative time, complication rate, and stone-free rate, were compared between two groups divided by whether preoperative stenting was performed. Results: Of the 260 patients enrolled in this study, 106 patients had no preoperative stenting (stentless group), and 154 patients had stenting (stenting group). Patient characteristics except for the presence of hydronephrosis and stone composition were not statistically different between the two groups. In surgical outcomes, the stone-free rate was not statistically different between the two groups (p = 0.901); however, the operation time for the stenting group was longer than that of the stentless group (44.8 ± 24.2 vs. 36.1 ± 17.6 min; p = 0.001). There were no differences in the complication rate between the two groups (p = 0.523).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate and analyze the effects of RFA on prostate tissues. Materials and Methods: A standard prostate RFA procedure was performed on 13 non-purebred dogs in three sessions: no cooling (NC), cooling with a 0.1% NaCl solution (C.01), and cooling using a 0.9% NaCl solution (C.09). Microtome-cut 2-3 µm sections of prostate samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and further examined. Results: A histopathologic evaluation identified four zones of exposure: direct, application, necrosis, and transitional, as the damage on tissues decreased going further from the ablation site. The areas and perimeters of these zones were calculated, and geometric shapes of ablative lesions were evaluated using the quotient formula. Areas and perimeters of prostate tissue lesions in the NC and C.09 sessions were of similar size, whereas those found in C.01 were statistically significantly smaller. Lesions observed in session C.01 were of the most regular geometric shape, while the most irregular ones were found in session C.09. The shapes of lesions closest to the ablation electrode were the most irregular, becoming more regular the further away from the electrode they were. Conclusions: Prostate RFA leads to tissue damage with distinct morphological zones. Notably, the prostate lesions were the smallest and the most regular in shape after RFA procedures using the 0.1% NaCl cooling solution. It can be argued that smaller ablation sites may result in smaller scars, thus allowing for faster tissue healing if the blood flow and innervation at the ablation site are not compromised.""","""['Darijus Skaudickas', 'Gintautas Vaitiekaitis', 'Julius Liobikas', 'Aldona Gružienė', 'Marcel Abras', 'Gita Gersone', 'Aleksandras Vitkus', 'Sigita Kerzienė', 'Greta Undžytė', 'Vincentas Veikutis', 'Artūras Kašauskas', 'Armuntas Baginskas', 'Algis Noreika']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""['Ex vivo experiment of saline-enhanced hepatic bipolar radiofrequency ablation with a perfused needle electrode: comparison with conventional monopolar and simultaneous monopolar modes.', 'Subsequent cooling-circulation after radiofrequency and microwave ablation avoids secondary indirect damage induced by residual thermal energy.', 'Radiofrequency ablation of the pancreas with and without intraluminal duodenal cooling in a porcine model.', 'Optimization of wet radiofrequency ablation using a perfused-cooled electrode: a comparative study in ex vivo bovine livers.', 'Radiofrequency ablation of porcine liver in vivo: effects of blood flow and treatment time on lesion size.']"""

The aim of this paper is to present the results of five Phase 2 studies that assessed the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy and safety of different loading dose regimens of teverelix DP. Methods: Five single-arm, uncontrolled clinical trials were conducted in patients with advanced prostate cancer. The five different loading dose regimens of teverelix DP tested were (a) a single 90 mg subcutaneous (SC) injection of teverelix DP given on 3 consecutive days (Days 0, 1 and 2); (b) a single 90 mg intramuscular (IM) injection of teverelix DP given 7 days apart (Days 0 and 7); (c) a single 120 mg SC injection of teverelix DP given on 2 consecutive days (Days 0 and 1); (d) 2 × 60 mg SC injections of teverelix DP given on 3 consecutive days (Days 0, 1 and 2), and (e) 2 × 90 mg SC injections of teverelix DP given on 3 consecutive days (Days 0, 1 and 2). The primary efficacy parameter was the duration of action of an initial loading dose regimen in terms of suppression of testosterone to below the castration level (0.5 ng/mL). Results: Eighty-two patients were treated with teverelix DP. Two regimens (90 mg and 180 mg SC on 3 consecutive days) had a mean duration of castration of 55.32 days and 68.95 days with >90% of patients having testosterone levels < 0.5 ng/mL at Day 28. The mean onset of castration for the SC regimens ranged from 1.10 to 1.77 days, while it was slower (2.4 days) with IM administration. The most common adverse event (AE) was injection site reaction. No AEs of severe intensity were reported. Conclusions: Teverelix DP is safe and well tolerated. Castrate levels of testosterone can be rapidly achieved following the subcutaneous injection of teverelix DP on 3 consecutive days.

The analysis of univariate Cox proportional hazard models identified a baseline CTC count ≥ 1, which was determined with the CellSearch® system, a Gleason sum ≥ 8, cT ≥ 2c and metastases at initial diagnosis as significant predictors of a worse OS in the entire cohort. The CTC count ≥ 1 was also the only significant predictor of a worse OS in a subset of 85 patients who presented with localized PCa at the baseline. The baseline CTC number did not affect the MFS.

Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling mediates resistance to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) and has also been recently implicated in PCa resistance to docetaxel (DTX), suggesting a role in therapy cross-resistance. Like GR, β-catenin is upregulated in metastatic and therapy-resistant tumors and is a crucial regulator of cancer stemness and ARSI resistance. β-catenin interacts with AR to promote PCa progression. Given the structural and functional similarities between AR and GR, we hypothesized that β-catenin also interacts with GR to influence PCa stemness and chemoresistance. As expected, we observed that treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone promotednuclear accumulation of GR and active β-catenin in PCa cells. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that GR and β-catenin interact in DTX-resistant and DTX-sensitive PCa cells. Pharmacological co-inhibition of GR and β-catenin, using the GR modulator CORT-108297 and the selective β-catenin inhibitor MSAB, enhanced cytotoxicity in DTX-resistant PCa cells grown in adherent and spheroid cultures and decreased CD44+/CD24- cell populations in tumorspheres.

Cancer and other fibroinflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), are associated with excessive collagen turnover leading to collagen triple helix unfolding and denaturation with exposure of immunodominant epitopes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of autoreactivity against denatured collagen in cancer. A technically robust assay to quantify autoantibodies against denatured type III collagen products (anti-dCol3) was developed and then measured in pretreatment serum from 223 cancer patients and 33 age-matched controls. Moreover, the association between anti-dCol3 levels and type III collagen degradation (C3M) and formation (PRO-C3) was investigated. Anti-dCol3 levels were significantly lower in patients with bladder (p = 0.0007), breast (p = 0.0002), colorectal (p < 0.0001), head and neck (p = 0.0005), kidney (p = 0.005), liver (p = 0.030), lung (p = 0.0004), melanoma (p < 0.0001), ovarian (p < 0.0001), pancreatic (p < 0.0001), prostate (p < 0.0001), and stomach cancers (p < 0.0001) compared to controls. High anti-dCol3 levels were associated with type III collagen degradation (C3M, p = 0.0002) but not type III collagen formation (PRO-C3, p = 0.26). Cancer patients with different solid tumor types have downregulated levels of circulating autoantibodies against denatured type III collagen compared to controls, suggesting that autoreactivity against unhealthy type III collagen may be important for tumor control and eradication. This autoimmunity biomarker may have the potential for studying the close relationship between autoimmunity and cancer.""","""['Christina Jensen', 'Patryk Drobinski', 'Jeppe Thorlacius-Ussing', 'Morten A Karsdal', 'Anne-Christine Bay-Jensen', 'Nicholas Willumsen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Blood-based extracellular matrix biomarkers are correlated with clinical outcome after PD-1 inhibition in patients with metastatic melanoma.', 'Non-invasive biomarkers derived from the extracellular matrix associate with response to immune checkpoint blockade (anti-CTLA-4) in metastatic melanoma patients.', 'Excessive collagen turnover products are released during colorectal cancer progression and elevated in serum from metastatic colorectal cancer patients.', ""Misbalance in type III collagen formation/degradation as a novel serological biomarker for penetrating (Montreal B3) Crohn's disease."", 'Systemic and local collagen turnover in hernia patients.']"""

However, the traditional sextant technique misses 15-46% of cancers. At present, there are problems regarding disease diagnosis/prognosis, especially in patients' classification, because the information to be handled is complex and challenging to process. Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) have high expression by prostate cancer (PCa) compared with benign prostate tissues. To assess the possible contribution to the diagnosis of PCa, we evaluated the expression of several MMPs in prostate tissues before and after PCa diagnosis using machine learning, classifiers, and supervised algorithms. A retrospective study was conducted on 29 patients diagnosed with PCa with previous benign needle biopsies, 45 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BHP), and 18 patients with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN). An immunohistochemical study was performed on tissue samples from tumor and non-tumor areas using specific antibodies against MMP -2, 9, 11, and 13, and the tissue inhibitor of MMPs -3 (TIMP-3), and the protein expression by different cell types was analyzed to which several automatic learning techniques have been applied. Compared with BHP or HGPIN specimens, epithelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts from benign prostate biopsies before the diagnosis of PCa showed a significantly higher expression of MMPs and TIMP-3. Machine learning techniques provide a differentiable classification between these patients, with greater than 95% accuracy, considering ECs, being slightly lower when considering fibroblasts. In addition, evolutionary changes were found in paired tissues from benign biopsy to prostatectomy specimens in the same patient. Thus, ECs from the tumor zone from prostatectomy showed higher expressions of MMPs and TIMP-3 compared to ECs of the corresponding zone from the benign biopsy. Similar differences were found for expressions of MMP-9 and TIMP-3, between fibroblasts from these zones. The classifiers have determined that patients with benign prostate biopsies before the diagnosis of PCa showed a high MMPs/TIMP-3 expression by ECs, so in the zone without future cancer development as in the zone with future tumor, compared with biopsy samples from patients with BPH or HGPIN. Expression of MMP -2, 9, 11, and 13, and TIMP-3 phenotypically define ECs associated with future tumor development. Also, the results suggest that MMPs/TIMPs expression in biopsy tissues may reflect evolutionary changes from prostate benign tissues to PCa. Thus, these findings in combination with other parameters might contribute to improving the suspicion of PCa diagnosis.""","""['Noemi Eiro', 'Antonio Medina', 'Luis O Gonzalez', 'Maria Fraile', 'Ana Palacios', 'Safwan Escaf', 'Jesús M Fernández-Gómez', 'Francisco J Vizoso']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Comparative analysis of the expression of metalloproteases (MMP-2, MMP-9, MMP-11 and MMP-13) and the tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 3 (TIMP-3) between previous negative biopsies and radical prostatectomies.', 'Differential expression of Low density lipoprotein Receptor-related Protein 1 (LRP-1) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in prostate gland: From normal to malignant lesions.', 'Expression of ERG protein, a prostate cancer specific marker, in high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN): lack of utility to stratify cancer risks associated with HGPIN.', 'Prostate needle biopsies containing prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia or atypical foci suspicious for carcinoma: implications for patient care.', 'In situ and intraductal epithelial proliferations of prostate: definitions and treatment implications.
