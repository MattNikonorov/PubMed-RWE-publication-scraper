The side effects of currently available therapies have triggered the search for new drugs. The marine environment, with its vast biodiversity, including sponges, is a rich source of natural products with immense pharmaceutical potential. The aim of the study was to analyze the microbes associated with the marine sponge, Lamellodysidea herbacea, and explore them as resources for anticancer ability. This study includes the isolation of fungi from L. herbacea, and their evaluation for cytotoxic potential against human cancer cell lines such as A-549 (lung), HCT-116 (colorectal carcinoma), HT-1080 (Fibrosarcoma), and PC-3 (prostate) using MTT assay. This revealed that fifteen extracts showed significant anticancer ability (IC50 ≤ 20 µg/mL), at least against one of the cell lines. Three extracts, SPG12, SPG19, and SDHY 01/02, were found significant in terms of anticancer activity, at least against three to four cell lines (IC50 values ≤ 20 µg/mL). The fungus SDHY01/02 was identified by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region as Alternaria alternata. Its extract showed IC50 values < 10 µg/mL against all the tested cell lines and was further analysed through light and fluorescence microscopy. The extract of SDHY01/02 was active (lowest IC50 4.27 µg/mL) against A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner and caused apoptotic cell death. Further, the extract was fractionated and analyzed the constituents by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry). Di-ethyl ether fraction revealed the constituents (having anticancer activity) such pyrrolo[1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methyl propyl); 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzo[C]rhiophene-1-carboxylic acid cyclopropylamide; 17-pentatriacontene; 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z, Z)-, methyl ester; while DCM fraction contained Oleic acid, eicosyl ester. This is the first report of A. alternata with anticancer potential that has been isolated from the sponge L. herbacea, as far as we are aware.This A. alternata can be exploited to get anticancer molecule(s) in the future.""","""['Meenu Katoch', 'Arem Qayum', 'Amit Kumar', 'Pragya Rani', 'P Gupta']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int Microbiol""","""['Metabolite profiling, in vitro and in silico assessment of antibacterial and anticancer activities of Alternaria alternata endophytic in Jatropha heynei.', 'Phytochemical Analysis and Anti-cancer Investigation of Boswellia serrata Bioactive Constituents In Vitro.', 'Isolation and Phytochemical Screening of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Medicinal Plant Mappia foetida and Evaluation of Its In Vitro Cytotoxicity in Cancer.', 'Screening of Bioactive Compounds from Endophytic Marine-Derived Fungi in Saudi Arabia: Antimicrobial and Anticancer Potential.', 'LC-MS/MS-Based Metabolomic Profiling of Constituents from Glochidion velutinum and Its Activity against Cancer Cell Lines.']"""

Inhibiting effects of AR may activate neuroendocrine differentiation and lineage plasticity pathways, thereby promoting the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC). Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of AR has important clinical implications for this most aggressive type of prostate cancer. Here, we demonstrated the tumor-suppressive role of the AR and found that activated AR could directly bind to the regulatory sequence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (CHRM4) and downregulate its expression. CHRM4 was highly expressed in prostate cancer cells after androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). CHRM4 overexpression may drive neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells and is associated with immunosuppressive cytokine responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of prostate cancer. Mechanistically, CHRM4-driven AKT/MYCN signaling upregulated the interferon alpha 17 (IFNA17) cytokine in the prostate cancer TME after ADT. IFNA17 mediates a feedback mechanism in the TME by activating the CHRM4/AKT/MYCN signaling-driven immune checkpoint pathway and neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of targeting CHRM4 as a potential treatment for NEPC and evaluated IFNA17 secretion in the TME as a possible predictive prognostic biomarker for NEPC.""","""['Yu-Ching Wen', 'Van Thi Ngoc Tram', 'Wei-Hao Chen', 'Chien-Hsiu Li', 'Hsiu-Lien Yeh', 'Phan Vu Thuy Dung', 'Kuo-Ching Jiang', 'Han-Ru Li', 'Jiaoti Huang', 'Michael Hsiao', 'Wei-Yu Chen', 'Yen-Nien Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Nerve growth factor interacts with CHRM4 and promotes neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer and castration resistance.', 'Targeting PKLR/MYCN/ROMO1 signaling suppresses neuroendocrine differentiation of castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'The Role of Epigenetic Change in Therapy-Induced Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer Lineage Plasticity.', 'Androgen deprivation-induced ZBTB46-PTGS1 signaling promotes neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer.', 'Role of PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway as a Pro-Survival Signaling and Resistance-Mediating Mechanism to Therapy of Prostate Cancer.']"""

To evaluate the prognostic significance of different patterns of isolated SVI in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) and pelvic lymphadenectomy.  Methods and materials:   We retrospectively analyzed all patients who underwent RP between 2007 and 2019. Inclusion criteria were localized prostate adenocarcinoma, SVI at RP, at least 24-months follow-up, and no adjuvant treatment. Patterns of SVI were following Ohori's classification: type 1: direct spread along the ejaculatory duct from inside; type 2: seminal vesicle invasion outside the prostate, through the capsule; type 3: the presence of cancer island(s) in the seminal vesicle with no continuity from the primary tumor (discontinuous metastases). Patients with type 3 SVI (isolated or in association) were included in the same group. Biochemical recurrence (BCR) was defined as any postoperative PSA ≥0.2 ng/ml. A logistic regression analysis was performed to assess predictors of BCR. Time to BCR was investigated using the Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test.  Results:   Sixty-one out of 1,356 patients were included. Median age was 67(7.2) years. Median PSA was 9.4(8.92) ng/ml. Mean follow-up was 85.28 ± 45.27 months. BCR occurred in 28(45.9%) patients. Logistic regression showed that a positive surgical margin (OR 19.964, 95%CI:1.172-29.322, P = 0.038) was predictor of BCR. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with pattern 3 had a significantly shorter time to BCR compared to other groups (log-rank, P = 0.016). The estimated time to BCR was 48.7 months in type 3, 60.9 months in pattern 1 + 2, 74.8, and 100.8 months in isolated patterns 1 and 2, respectively. In patients with negative surgical margins, pattern 3 confirmed a shorter time to BCR compared to other types of invasions, with an estimated time to BCR of 30.8 months.  Conclusions:   Patients with type 3 SVI demonstrated a shorter time to BCR compared to other patterns.""","""['Andrea B Galosi', 'Giulio Milanese', 'Lorenzo Montesi', 'Alessia Cimadamore', 'Carmine Franzese', 'Erika Palagonia', 'Giuseppe Chiacchio', 'Daniele Castellani']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Retrospective Cohort Analysis from a High-Volume Center of Prognostic Factors Affecting Biochemical Relapse in Patients with Encapsulated, Margin-Negative, Isolated Seminal Vesicle Invasion After Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy: A Novel Study.', 'Lymph node yield during radical prostatectomy does not impact rate of biochemical recurrence in patients with seminal vesicle invasion and node-negative disease.', 'Bilateral Seminal Vesicle Invasion Is Not Associated with Worse Outcomes in Locally Advanced Prostate Carcinoma.', 'Adverse pathology and undetectable ultrasensitive prostate-specific antigen after radical prostatectomy: is adjuvant radiation warranted?', 'Prognostic significance of lymphovascular invasion in radical prostatectomy specimens.']"""

Here, we aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes and test whether combining enzalutamide with abiraterone and androgen deprivation therapy improves survival.  Methods:   We analysed two open-label, randomised, controlled, phase 3 trials of the STAMPEDE platform protocol, with no overlapping controls, conducted at 117 sites in the UK and Switzerland. Eligible patients (no age restriction) had metastatic, histologically-confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma; a WHO performance status of 0-2; and adequate haematological, renal, and liver function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computerised algorithm and a minimisation technique to either standard of care (androgen deprivation therapy; docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously for six cycles with prednisolone 10 mg orally once per day allowed from Dec 17, 2015) or standard of care plus abiraterone acetate 1000 mg and prednisolone 5 mg (in the abiraterone trial) orally or abiraterone acetate and prednisolone plus enzalutamide 160 mg orally once a day (in the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial). Patients were stratified by centre, age, WHO performance status, type of androgen deprivation therapy, use of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pelvic nodal status, planned radiotherapy, and planned docetaxel use. The primary outcome was overall survival assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who started treatment. A fixed-effects meta-analysis of individual patient data was used to compare differences in survival between the two trials. STAMPEDE is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00268476) and ISRCTN (ISRCTN78818544).  Findings:   Between Nov 15, 2011, and Jan 17, 2014, 1003 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care (n=502) or standard of care plus abiraterone (n=501) in the abiraterone trial. Between July 29, 2014, and March 31, 2016, 916 patients were randomly assigned to standard of care (n=454) or standard of care plus abiraterone and enzalutamide (n=462) in the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial. Median follow-up was 96 months (IQR 86-107) in the abiraterone trial and 72 months (61-74) in the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial. In the abiraterone trial, median overall survival was 76·6 months (95% CI 67·8-86·9) in the abiraterone group versus 45·7 months (41·6-52·0) in the standard of care group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·62 [95% CI 0·53-0·73]; p<0·0001). In the abiraterone and enzalutamide trial, median overall survival was 73·1 months (61·9-81·3) in the abiraterone and enzalutamide group versus 51·8 months (45·3-59·0) in the standard of care group (HR 0·65 [0·55-0·77]; p<0·0001). We found no difference in the treatment effect between these two trials (interaction HR 1·05 [0·83-1·32]; pinteraction=0·71) or between-trial heterogeneity (I2 p=0·70). In the first 5 years of treatment, grade 3-5 toxic effects were higher when abiraterone was added to standard of care (271 [54%] of 498 vs 192 [38%] of 502 with standard of care) and the highest toxic effects were seen when abiraterone and enzalutamide were added to standard of care (302 [68%] of 445 vs 204 [45%] of 454 with standard of care). Cardiac causes were the most common cause of death due to adverse events (five [1%] with standard of care plus abiraterone and enzalutamide [two attributed to treatment] and one (<1%) with standard of care in the abiraterone trial).  Interpretation:   Enzalutamide and abiraterone should not be combined for patients with prostate cancer starting long-term androgen deprivation therapy. Clinically important improvements in survival from addition of abiraterone to androgen deprivation therapy are maintained for longer than 7 years.

However, all reported TMEM16A structures are either closed or desensitized, and direct inhibition of the open state by drug molecules lacks a reliable structural basis. Therefore, revealing the druggable pocket of TMEM16A exposed in the open state is important for understanding protein-ligand interactions and facilitating rational drug design. Here, we reconstructed the calcium-activated open conformation of TMEM16A using an enhanced sampling algorithm and segmental modeling. Furthermore, we identified an open-state druggable pocket and screened a potent TMEM16A inhibitor, etoposide, which is a derivative of a traditional herbal monomer. Molecular simulations and site-directed mutagenesis showed that etoposide binds to the open state of TMEM16A, thereby blocking the ion conductance pore of the channel. Finally, we demonstrated that etoposide can target TMEM16A to inhibit the proliferation of prostate cancer PC-3 cells. Together, these findings provide a deep understanding of the TMEM16A open state at an atomic level and identify pockets for the design of novel inhibitors with broad applications in chloride channel biology, biophysics, and medicinal chemistry.""","""['Sai Shi', 'Biao Ma', 'Qiushuang Ji', 'Shuai Guo', 'Hailong An', 'Sheng Ye']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biol Chem""","""['Theaflavin binds to a druggable pocket of TMEM16A channel and inhibits lung adenocarcinoma cell viability.', 'Cryo-EM structures of the TMEM16A calcium-activated chloride channel.', 'TMEM16A inhibitors reveal TMEM16A as a minor component of calcium-activated chloride channel conductance in airway and intestinal epithelial cells.', 'Recent progress in structural studies on TMEM16A channel.', 'Calcium-activated chloride channels: structure, properties, role in physiological and pathological processes.']"""

Materials and methods:   Within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (2000-2018), ACB patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) were identified. Multivariable competing risks regression (CRR) analyses assessed the independent predictor status of organ-confined (OC, T2N0M0) vs non-organ-confined stage (NOC, T3-4N0M0 or TanyN1-3M0) on CSM. Conditional 36-months' CSM-free survival estimates were computed based on event-free intervals of 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after RC, according to stage.  Results:   Of 475 ACB patients, 132 (28%) harbored OC vs 343 (72%) harbored NOC stage. In multivariable CRR models, NOC vs OC stage independently predicted lower CSM (hazard ratio 3.55; 95% CI 2.66, 5.83; p < 0.001). Conversely, neither chemotherapy nor radiotherapy were independently associated with CSM. In OC stage, 36-months' CSM-free survival rate was 84% at baseline.

Accumulating studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in the regulation of diverse cellular and molecular processes during the development and progression of cancer. Here, we utilized a unique cohort of castration-resistant prostate cancer metastases (mCRPC) and corresponding localized tumors and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). First, we showed that patient-to-patient variability accounted for most of the variance in lncRNA expression between the samples, suggesting that genomic alterations in the samples are the main drivers of lncRNA expression in PCa metastasis. Subsequently, we identified 27 lncRNAs with differential expression (DE-lncRNAs) between metastases and corresponding primary tumors, suggesting that they are mCRPC-specific lncRNAs. Analyses of potential regulation by transcription factors (TFs) revealed that approximately half of the DE-lncRNAs have at least one binding site for the androgen receptor in their regulatory regions.

However, sparing of the nerve bundles adjacent to the posterolateral sides of the prostate reduces the number of complications at the risk of positive surgical margins. Preoperative selection of men eligible for safe, nerve-sparing surgery is therefore needed. Our aim was to identify pathological factors associated with positive posterolateral surgical margins in men undergoing bilateral nerve-sparing RP.  Methods and results:   Prostate cancer patients undergoing RP with standardised intra-operative surgical margin assessment according to the NeuroSAFE technique were included. Preoperative biopsies were reviewed for grade group (GG), cribriform and/or intraductal carcinoma (CR/IDC), perineural invasion (PNI), cumulative tumour length and extraprostatic extension (EPE). Of 624 included patients, 573 (91.8%) received NeuroSAFE bilaterally and 51 (8.2%) unilaterally, resulting in a total of 1197 intraoperative posterolateral surgical margin assessments. Side-specific biopsy findings were correlated to ipsilateral NeuroSAFE outcome. Higher biopsy GG, CR/IDC, PNI, EPE, number of positive biopsies and cumulative tumour length were all associated with positive posterolateral margins. In multivariable bivariate logistic regression, ipsilateral PNI [odds ratio (OR) = 2.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.62-5.48; P < 0.001] and percentage of positive cores (OR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.08-1.29; P < 0.001) were significant predictors for a positive posterolateral margin, while GG and CR/IDC were not.  Conclusions:   Ipsilateral PNI and percentage of positive cores were significant predictors for a positive posterolateral surgical margin at RP. Biopsy PNI and tumour volume can therefore support clinical decision-making on the level of nerve-sparing surgery in prostate cancer patients.""","""['Margaretha A van der Slot', 'Sebastiaan Remmers', 'Charlotte F Kweldam', 'Michael A den Bakker', 'Daan Nieboer', 'Martijn B Busstra', 'Melanie Gan', 'Sjoerd Klaver', 'John B W Rietbergen', 'Geert J L H van Leenders;Anser Prostate Cancer Network']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Histopathology""","""['Factors Affecting Surgical Margin Positivity after Radical Prostatectomy in the Turkish Population: A Multicenter Study of the Urooncology Association.', 'Prostate biopsy perineural invasion is not independently associated with positive surgical margins following radical retropubic prostatectomy.', 'Intraoperative assessment and reporting of radical prostatectomy specimens to guide nerve-sparing surgery in prostate cancer patients (NeuroSAFE).', 'NeuroSAFE in radical prostatectomy increases the rate of nerve-sparing surgery without affecting oncological outcome.', 'Multiple measures of carcinoma extent versus perineural invasion in prostate needle biopsy tissue in prediction of pathologic stage in a screening population.']"""

However, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) invariably arises with restored AR signaling activity. To date, the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) is the only targeted region for all clinically available AR signaling antagonists, such as enzalutamide (ENZ). Major resistance mechanisms have been uncovered to sustain the AR signaling in CRPC despite these treatments, including AR amplification, AR LBD mutants, and the emergence of AR splice variants (AR-Vs) such as AR-V7. AR-V7 is a constitutively active truncated form of AR that lacks the LBD; thus, it can not be inhibited by AR LBD-targeting drugs. Therefore, an approach to inhibit AR through the regions outside of LBD is urgently needed. In this study, we have discovered a novel small molecule SC428, which directly binds to the AR N-terminal domain (NTD) and exhibits pan-AR inhibitory effect. SC428 potently decreased the transactivation of AR-V7, ARv567es, as well as full-length AR (AR-FL) and its LBD mutants. SC428 substantially suppressed androgen-stimulated AR-FL nuclear translocation, chromatin binding, and AR-regulated gene transcription. Moreover, SC428 also significantly attenuated AR-V7-mediated AR signaling that does not rely on androgen, hampered AR-V7 nuclear localization, and disrupted AR-V7 homodimerization. SC428 inhibited in vitro proliferation and in vivo tumor growth of cells that expressed a high level of AR-V7 and were unresponsive to ENZ treatment. Together, these results indicated the potential therapeutic benefits of AR-NTD targeting for overcoming drug resistance in CRPC.""","""['Qianhui Yi', 'Weiguo Liu', 'Jung Hwa Seo', 'Jie Su', 'Moulay A Alaoui-Jamali', 'Jun Luo', 'Rongtuan Lin', 'Jian Hui Wu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Cancer Ther""","""['Combination therapy with androgen receptor N-terminal domain antagonist EPI-7170 and enzalutamide yields synergistic activity in AR-V7-positive prostate cancer.', 'Targeting Androgen Receptor Activation Function-1 with EPI to Overcome Resistance Mechanisms in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Targeting androgen receptor and the variants by an orally bioavailable Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras compound in castration resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting the N-terminal domain of the androgen receptor: The effective approach in therapy of CRPC.', 'AR-V7 in Metastatic Prostate Cancer: A Strategy beyond Redemption.']"""

Disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow often obtain new characteristics to cause therapy resistance and tumor recurrence. Thus, understanding the status of disseminated prostate cancer cells in bone marrow is crucial for developing a new treatment.  Methods:   We analyzed the transcriptome of disseminated tumor cells from a single cell RNA-sequencing data of PCa bone metastases. We built a bone metastasis model through caudal artery injection of tumor cells, and sorted the tumor hybrid cells by flow cytometry. We performed multi-omics analysis, including transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis, to compare the difference between the tumor hybrid cells and parental cells. In vivo experiments were performed to analyze the tumor growth rate, metastatic and tumorigenic potential, drug and radiation sensitivity in hybrid cells. Single cell RNA-sequencing and CyTOF were performed to analyze the impact of hybrid cells on tumor microenvironment.  Results:   Here, we identified a unique cluster of cancer cells in PCa bone metastases, which expressed myeloid cell markers and showed a significant change in pathways related to immune regulation and tumor progression. We found that cell fusion between disseminated tumor cells and bone marrow cells can be source of these myeloid-like tumor cells. Multi-omics showed the pathways related to cell adhesion and proliferation, such as focal adhesion, tight junction, DNA replication, and cell cycle, were most significantly changed in these hybrid cells. In vivo experiment showed hybrid cells had a significantly increased proliferative rate, and metastatic potential. Single cell RNA-sequencing and CyTOF showed tumor-associated neutrophils/monocytes/macrophages were highly enriched in hybrid cells-induced tumor microenvironment with a higher immunosuppressive capacity. Otherwise, the hybrid cells showed an enhanced EMT phenotype with higher tumorigenicity, and were resistant to docetaxel and ferroptosis, but sensitive to radiotherapy.  Conclusion:   Taken together, our data demonstrate that spontaneous cell fusion in bone marrow can generate myeloid-like tumor hybrid cells that promote the progression of bone metastasis, and these unique population of disseminated tumor cells can provide a potential therapeutic target for PCa bone metastasis.""","""['Xinyu Ye#', 'Xin Huang#', 'Xing Fu', 'Xiao Zhang', 'Risheng Lin', 'Wen Zhang', 'Jian Zhang', 'Yi Lu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Hematol Oncol""","""['Detection and isolation of disseminated tumor cells in bone marrow of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.', 'Increased expression of putative cancer stem cell markers in the bone marrow of prostate cancer patients is associated with bone metastasis progression.', 'Prostate cancer extracellular vesicles mediate intercellular communication with bone marrow cells and promote metastasis in a cholesterol-dependent manner.', 'Molecular insights into prostate cancer progression: the missing link of tumor microenvironment.', 'Bone Marrow Microenvironment as a Regulator and Therapeutic Target for Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis.']"""

Methods:   A Bi-centered retrospective cohort study on biopsy-naïve male population who received ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy from Jan. 2015 to Feb. 2022 was proposed. All enrolled patients should have undergone serum-PSA test, TR-CDFI and multiparametric MRI before biopsy, and subsequently opted for surgical intervention, enabling more accurate pathological grading.

Outcome measurements were overall prostate cancer (PCA) detection rate, clinically significant PCA (csPCA) detection rate, clinically insignificant PCA (cisPCA) detection rate, biopsy avoidance rate and missed csPCA detection rate. Decision curve analysis was used to compare the performances between diagnostic pathways.  Results:   Under the criteria mentioned above, 752 patients from two centers were included.

This study assessed the effect of cancer diagnosis on beliefs about comorbid diabetes mellitus and assessed changes in beliefs about cancer and diabetes over time.  Data sources:   We recruited 75 patients with type 2 diabetes who were newly diagnosed with early-stage breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer and 104 age-, sex-, and hemoglobin A1c-matched controls. Participants completed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire four times over 12 months. The authors examined within-patient and between-group differences in cancer and diabetes beliefs at baseline and over time.  Results:   Overall, diabetes beliefs did not differ between cancer patients and controls at baseline. Cancer patients' beliefs about diabetes varied significantly over time; they reported less concern about cancer, less emotional effect, and greater cancer knowledge over time. Participants without cancer were significantly more likely to report that diabetes affected their life across all time points, though this effect did not persist after adjustment for sociodemographic variables.  Conclusion:   While all patients' diabetes beliefs were similar at baseline and 12 months, cancer patients' beliefs about both illnesses fluctuated during the months following cancer diagnosis.  Implications for nursing practice:   Oncology nurses can play a key role in recognizing the effects of cancer diagnosis on beliefs about comorbid conditions and fluctuations in these beliefs during treatment.

Here, we report that neuropilin-2 (NRP2), which functions as a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor on tumor cells, is an attractive target to activate antitumor immunity in prostate cancer because VEGF-NRP2 signaling sustains PD-L1 expression. NRP2 depletion increased T cell activation in vitro. In a syngeneic model of prostate cancer that is resistant to ICI, inhibition of the binding of VEGF to NRP2 using a mouse-specific anti-NRP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) resulted in necrosis and tumor regression compared with both an anti-PD-L1 mAb and control immunoglobulin G. This therapy also decreased tumor PD-L1 expression and increased immune cell infiltration. We observed that the NRP2, VEGFA, and VEGFC genes are amplified in metastatic castration-resistant and neuroendocrine prostate cancer. We also found that individuals with NRP2High PD-L1High metastatic tumors had lower androgen receptor expression and higher neuroendocrine prostate cancer scores than other individuals with prostate cancer. In organoids derived from patients with neuroendocrine prostate cancer, therapeutic inhibition of VEGF binding to NRP2 using a high-affinity humanized mAb suitable for clinical use also diminished PD-L1 expression and caused a substantial increase in immune-mediated tumor cell killing, consistent with the animal studies.

Methods:   Using a decision model, the current MRI strategy was compared with two SelectMDx strategies: SelectMDx used before MRI to select men for MRI and SelectMDx used after a negative MRI to select men for biopsy. Parameters were informed by the literature most relevant for both populations. Differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs between the current strategy and the SelectMDx strategies were calculated using two different assumptions regarding PCa-specific mortality (SPCG-4 and PIVOT).  Results:   In biopsy naïve men, the use of SelectMDx before MRI results in a gain of 0.004 QALY per patient under the SPCG-4 scenario, and a gain of 0.030 QALY under the PIVOT scenario. The cost savings are $1650 per patient. When used after MRI, SelectMDx results in a QALY gain per patient of 0.004 (SPCG-4), and 0.006 (PIVOT) with $262 in cost savings. In the previous negative population, SelectMDx before MRI results in a QALY gain of 0.006 (SPCG-4) and 0.022 (PIVOT), with $1281 in cost savings per patient. SelectMDx after MRI results in a QALY gain of 0.003 (SPCG-4) and 0.004 (PIVOT) with $193 in cost savings.  Conclusion:   Application of SelectMDx results in better health outcomes and cost savings.

Methods:   A stable prostate cancer cell line (MDA PCa 2b) overexpressing miR-92a-1-5p was constructed by lentivirus, and EVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation. The overexpression of miR-92a-1-5p in both cells and EVs was tested using qPCR. Osteoclast function was evaluated by Trap staining, mRNA expression of osteoclastic markers ctsk and trap, immunolabeling of CTSK and TRAP and microCT using either in vitro and in vivo assays. Target gene of miR-92a-1-5p was proved by a dual-luciferase reporter assay system. siRNAs were designed and used for transient expression in order to determine the role of downstream genes on osteoclast differentiation.  Results:   Stable overexpression cells of miRNA-92a-5p was associated with EVs upregulating this microRNA, as confirmed by qPCR. Further, miR-92a-1-5p enriched EVs promote osteoclast differentiation in vitro by reducing MAPK1 and FoxO1 expression, associated with increased osteoclast function as shown by TRAP staining and mRNA expression of osteoclast functional genes. siRNA targeting MAPK1 or FoxO1 resulted in similar increase in osteoclast function. In vivo, the miR-92a-1-5p enriched EVs given via i.v. injection promote osteolysis, which was associated with reduction of MAPK1 and FoxO1 expression in bone marrow.

Radiotherapy and immunotherapy are commonly used in treating PCa, but understanding the crosstalk mechanisms of carcinogenesis and new therapeutic approaches is essential for supporting poor diagnosis and existing therapies. Astaxanthin (ASX) is a member of the xanthophyll family that is an oxygenated derivative of carotenoids whose synthesis is in plant extracts from lycopene. ASX has protective effects on various diseases, such as Parkinson's disease and cancer by showing potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, there is an ongoing need for a detailed investigation of the molecular mechanism of action to expand its therapeutic use. In the present study, we showed the new regulatory role of ASX in PCa cells by affecting the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling, autophagic activity, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and regulating the expression level of angiogenesis-related protein vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), proto-oncogene c-Myc and prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Additionally, we determined that it exhibited synergistic action with cisplatin and significantly enhanced apoptotic cell death in PCa cells.

It was initially a disease of older men above the age of 55 years. Of recent, there has been reports of increase in the number of young men <55 years with prostate cancer (PCa). The disease in this age group has been reported to be more lethal because of aggressive characteristics and metastatic potential. Different populations have different proportions of young-onset PCa. The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of young men aged <55 years with PCa in Nigeria.  Methods:   Data on the prevalence of young men <55 years with PCa was extracted from the 2022 report of the prevalence of cancer in Nigeria from 2009 to 2016 based on the records of 15 major Cancer Registries in Nigeria. This was a publication of the Nigerian Ministry of Health and represents the most up to date data.  Results:   In 4864 men diagnosed with malignancies before age 55, PCa was the second common, following liver cancer. Out of a total of 4091 cases of PCa in all age groups, 355 were diagnosed in men <55 years representing 8.86%. Furthermore, the proportion of young men with the disease in the Northern part of the country was 11.72%, whereas in the South, it was 7.77%.  Conclusions:   PCa is the second most common cancer in young Nigerian men aged< 55 years preceded by liver cancer. The proportion of young men with PCa was 8.86%. It is therefore important to consider PCa in young men as a different entity and develop appropriate ways to control this disease to ensure survival and good quality of life.""","""['Atara Ntekim', 'Ayorinde Folasire', 'Oluwaponmile A Odukoya']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Control""","""['Awareness and Attitudes of Nigerian Men Living in Abuja on Prostate Cancer and Screening.', 'Prevalence of prostate cancer at autopsy in Nigeria-A preliminary report.', 'The Prevalence of Zinc Deficiency among Men with and without Prostate Cancer in Port Harcourt, Nigeria.', 'Evidence of cancer progression as the cause of death in men with prostate cancer in Sweden.', 'Need for and relevance of prostate cancer screening in Nigeria.']"""

In this report, we described the design and syntheses of a series of dual MDM2/XIAP inhibitors based on the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold from our previously reported lead compound JW-2-107 and tested their cytotoxicity in a panel of human cancer cell lines. The best compound identified in this study is compound 3e. Western blot analyses demonstrated that treatments with 3e decreased MDM2 and XIAP protein levels and increased expression of p53, resulting in cancer cell growth inhibition and cell death. Furthermore, compound 3e effectively inhibited tumor growth in vivo when tested using a human 22Rv1 prostate cancer xenograft model.

Methods:   107 breast or prostate cancer survivors (52% females, age 58 ± 10 years, 6-52 weeks after primary therapy) performed one out of four training programs, two sessions/week, over 12 weeks: work rate-matched vigorous intensity aerobic training (ATStandard, n = 28) and polarized intensity aerobic training (ATPolarized, n = 26) as well as volume-matched moderate intensity resistance training (RTStandard, n = 26) and daily undulating intensity resistance training (RTUndulating, n = 27). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL, EORTC-QLQ-C30) and cancer-related fatigue (CRF, MFI-20) were assessed at baseline, at the end of intervention and after a 12-week follow-up without further prescribed exercise.  Results:   Over the intervention period, HRQoL-function-scales of the EORTC-QLQ-C30 improved over time (p = .007), but no group*time interaction was observed (p = .185). Similarly, CRF values of the MFI-20 improved over time (p = .006), but no group*time interaction was observed (p = .663). When including the follow-up period and pooling the AT and the RT groups, HRQoL-function-scales developed differently between groups (p = .022) with further improvements in RT and a decline in AT. For CRF no significant interaction was found, but univariate analyses showed a non-significant trend of more sustainable effects in RT.  Conclusions:   AT and RT with different work rate-/volume-matched intensity prescriptions elicits positive effects on HRQoL and CRF, without one regimen being significantly superior to another over the intervention period. However, RT might result in more sustainable effects compared to AT over a follow-up period without any further exercise prescription.

Purpose To assess lesion-based clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) rates in different PI-RADS version 2.1 categories and to identify MRI features that could improve csPCa detection. Materials and Methods This single-center prospective study included men with suspected or known prostate cancer who underwent multiparametric MRI and MRI/US-guided biopsy from April 2019 to December 2021. MRI scans were prospectively evaluated using PI-RADS version 2.1. Atypical transition zone (TZ) nodules were upgraded to category 3 if marked diffusion restriction was present. Lesions with an International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade of 2 or higher (range, 1-5) were considered csPCa. MRI features, including three-dimensional diameter, relative lesion volume (lesion volume divided by prostate volume), sphericity, and surface to volume ratio (SVR), were obtained from lesion contours delineated by the radiologist. Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted at the lesion and participant levels to determine features associated with csPCa. Results In total, 454 men (median age, 67 years [IQR, 62-73 years]) with 838 lesions were included. The csPCa rates for lesions categorized as PI-RADS 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 170), 3 (n = 197), 4 (n = 319), and 5 (n = 149) were 0%, 9%, 14%, 37%, and 77%, respectively. csPCa rates of PI-RADS 4 lesions were lower than PI-RADS 5 lesions (P < .001) but higher than PI-RADS 3 lesions (P < .001). Upgraded PI-RADS 3 TZ lesions were less likely to harbor csPCa compared with their nonupgraded counterparts (4% [one of 26] vs 20% [20 of 99], P = .02). Predictors of csPCa included relative lesion volume (odds ratio [OR], 1.6; P < .001), SVR (OR, 6.2; P = .02), and extraprostatic extension (EPE) scores of 2 (OR, 9.3; P < .001) and 3 (OR, 4.1; P = .02). Conclusion The rates of csPCa differed between consecutive PI-RADS categories of 3 and higher. MRI features, including lesion volume, shape, and EPE scores of 2 and 3, predicted csPCa.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the estimates of the area under the curve (AUC) were 0.739 for the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and 0.941 for miRNA-375 and 0.946 for miRNA-148a. The sensitivity and specificity reached 75 and 100% for miRNA-375 and 71 and 94% for miRNA-148a, respectively, which was better than serum PSA. This strategy constructed a reliable system for dual miRNA detection in urine samples and proposed new insights into the rapid and noninvasive diagnosis of PC.""","""['Pengjun Jiang', 'Yunjin Bai', 'Li Yan', 'Pan Feng', 'Ke Huang', 'Jie Chen', 'Piaopiao Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""['Selective recognition of CdTe QDs and strand displacement signal amplification-assisted label-free and homogeneous fluorescence assay of nucleic acid and protein.', 'Diagnostic and Prognostic MicroRNA Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer in Cell-free Urine.', 'Multimode MicroRNA Sensing via Multiple Enzyme-Free Signal Amplification and Cation-Exchange Reaction.', 'Detection of miRNAs in urine of prostate cancer patients.', 'The utility of urine-circulating miRNAs for detection of prostate cancer.']"""

The combined ARFI/SWEI sequence uses closely spaced push beams across the lateral field of view and simultaneously tracks both on-axis (within the region of excitation) and off-axis (laterally offset from the excitation) after each push beam. Using a large number of push beams across the lateral field of view enables the collection of higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) shear wave data to reconstruct the SWEI volume than is typically acquired. The shear wave arrival times were determined with cross-correlation of shear wave velocity signals in two dimensions after 3-D directional filtering to remove reflection artifacts. To combine data from serially interrogated lateral push locations, arrival times from different pushes were aligned by estimating the shear wave propagation time between push locations. Shear wave data acquired in an elasticity lesion phantom and reconstructed using this algorithm demonstrate benefits to contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) with increased push beam density and 3-D directional filtering. Increasing the push beam spacing from 0.3 to 11.6 mm (typical for commercial SWEI systems) resulted in a 53% decrease in CNR. In human in vivo data, this imaging approach enabled high CNR (1.61-1.86) imaging of histologically-confirmed prostate cancer. The in vivo images had improved spatial resolution and CNR and fewer reflection artifacts as a result of the high push beam density, the high shear wave SNR, the use of multidimensional directional filtering, and the combination of shear wave data from different push beams.""","""['Derek Y Chan', 'Daniel Cody Morris', 'Thomas J Polascik', 'Mark L Palmeri', 'Kathryn R Nightingale']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Ultrason Imaging""","""['Multi-source and multi-directional shear wave generation with intersecting steered ultrasound push beams.', 'Characterizing stiffness of human prostates using acoustic radiation force.', 'Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging Using Nondiffractive Bessel Apodized Acoustic Radiation Force.', 'Prostate Cancer Detection Using 3-D Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging.', 'Comb-push ultrasound shear elastography (CUSE) with various ultrasound push beams.']"""

Methods:   A total of 24,470 patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa were included in this study. Multivariate logistic regression model was used to screen the independent risk factors of LNM. At the same time, six algorithms, namely random forest (RF), naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), xgboost (XGB), gradient boosting machine (GBM), logistic regression (LR) and decision tree (DT) are used to establish risk prediction models. Based on the best prediction performance of ML algorithm, a prediction model is established, and the performance of the model is evaluated from three aspects: area under curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity.  Results:   In multivariate logistic regression analysis, T stage, PSA, Gleason score and bone metastasis were independent predictors of LNM in patients with intermediate- and high-risk PCa. By comprehensively comparing the prediction model performance of training set and test set, GBM model has the best prediction performance (F1 score = 0.838, AUROC = 0.804).

Multiple derivatization strategies have been developed to stabilize and facilitate the analysis of sialic acid isomers and their glycoconjugate carriers by high-performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry workflows. Herein, a set of novel derivatization schemes are described that result in the introduction of bioorthogonal click chemistry alkyne or azide groups into α2,3- and α2,8-linked sialic acids. These chemical modifications were validated and structurally characterized using model isomeric sialic acid conjugates and model protein carriers. Use of an alkyne-amine, propargylamine, as the second amidation reagent effectively introduces an alkyne functional group into α2,3-linked sialic acid glycoproteins. In tissues, serum, and cultured cells, this allows for the detection and visualization of N-linked glycan sialic acid isomers by imaging mass spectrometry approaches. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded prostate cancer tissues and pancreatic cancer cell lines were used to characterize the numbers and distribution of alkyne-modified α2,3-linked sialic acid N-glycans. An azide-amine compound with a poly(ethylene glycol) linker was evaluated for use in histochemical staining. Formalin-fixed pancreatic cancer tissues were amidated with the azide amine, reacted with biotin-alkyne and copper catalyst, and sialic acid isomers detected by streptavidin-peroxidase staining.

Materials and methods:   This 2-arm, open-label, randomized trial recruited men with testosterone deficiency at the University of Miami between August 2020 and October 2022. Men with 2 total testosterone levels <350 ng/dL and hypogonadal symptoms, aged 18-75 years were randomly assigned to receive either intranasal testosterone gel 11 mg 3 times daily or intramuscular testosterone cypionate 200 mg every 2 weeks. The primary outcome was change in hematocrit after 4 months of treatment. Secondary outcomes were changes in serum testosterone, estradiol, prostate-specific antigen, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, and the 6-item International Index of Erectile Function.  Results:   Of the 81 men randomized, 54 completed treatment (intranasal n=23; intramuscular n=31). The mean age was 47.5 vs 49.5 years, with mean baseline testosterone of 244.6 vs 240.7 ng/dL and mean hematocrit of 44.4% vs 42.7% in intranasal vs intramuscular groups, respectively. Men who received intramuscular injections had a significant increase after 4 months of treatment in mean hematocrit from 42.7% to 46.6% (P < .0001), but there was no significant change in men who received intranasal gel (P = .233). Men in both groups experienced significantly increased serum testosterone levels throughout the study period, though a larger increase was seen in men treated with intramuscular injections (mean change 511 vs 283, P = .025). Men who received injections also experienced an increase in estradiol (mean change 22.9, P < .001), decrease in 17-hydroxyprogesterone (mean change -39.8, P < .0001), and increase in the 6-item International Index of Erectile Function score (mean change 4.8, P = .015); men treated with intranasal gel experienced no such changes. Prostate-specific antigen levels were stable in both groups.  Conclusions:   Intranasal testosterone gel does not appear to significantly affect hematocrit levels.

To date, molecular biomarkers for active surveillance have relied solely on RNA or protein. We trained and independently validated multimodal (mRNA abundance, DNA methylation, and/or DNA copy number) biomarkers that more accurately separate grade group 1 from grade group ≥2 cancers.  Materials and methods:   Low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients were assigned to training (n=333) and validation (n=202) cohorts. We profiled the abundance of 342 mRNAs, 100 DNA copy number alteration loci, and 14 hypermethylation sites at 2 locations per tumor. Using the training cohort with cross-validation, we evaluated methods for training classifiers of pathological grade group ≥2 in centrally reviewed radical prostatectomies. We trained 2 distinct classifiers, PRONTO-e and PRONTO-m, and validated them in an independent radical prostatectomy cohort.  Results:   PRONTO-e comprises 353 mRNA and copy number alteration features. PRONTO-m includes 94 clinical, mRNAs, copy number alterations, and methylation features at 14 and 12 loci, respectively. In independent validation, PRONTO-e and PRONTO-m predicted grade group ≥2 with respective true-positive rates of 0.81 and 0.76, and false-positive rates of 0.43 and 0.26. Both classifiers were resistant to sampling error and identified more upgrading cases than a well-validated presurgical risk calculator, CAPRA (Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment; P < .001).

Results:   In patients receiving docetaxel for mCRPC, the incidence of FN and neutropenia was 34/137 (25%) and 45/137 (33%), respectively. Among 34 patients who developed FN, 94% required hospitalization for FN for a mean of 5 days (± 2.8) and 6% died. Following FN, 53% required at least 1 treatment delay and 71% had at least 1 dose reduction. Age category (OR 2.025, 95% CI 1.13-3.627) and presence of multiple comorbidities (OR 1.466, 95% CI 1.01-2.258) increased the risk of FN.  Conclusion:   The incidence of FN and neutropenia in the clinical setting in patients receiving docetaxel for mCRPC is higher than previously reported and high enough to consider primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony stimulating factors in high-risk groups. Age and multiple comorbidities were identified as risk factors.""","""['Sophie Peltekian', 'Shellyza Sajwani', 'Xiang Wang', 'Salmaan Kanji']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""['Prevention of docetaxel-associated febrile neutropenia with primary granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in Chinese metastatic hormone-sensitive and castration-resistant prostate cancer patients.', 'Risk of febrile neutropenia and early treatment cessation in men receiving standard and dose-reduced 3-weekly docetaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Does castration status affect docetaxel-related adverse events? :Identification of risk factors for docetaxel-related adverse events in metastatic prostate cancer.', 'Optimal primary febrile neutropenia prophylaxis for patients receiving docetaxel-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy for breast cancer: a systematic review.', 'Systematic review and meta-analysis of febrile neutropenia risk with TCH(P) in HER2-positive breast cancer.']"""

Materials and methods:   Men with prostate cancer recurrence underwent positron emission tomography/CT 50-70 minutes after intravenous administration of 296±20% MBq 18F-rhPSMA-7.3. To assess the coprimary end points (verified detection rate and combined region-level positive predictive value), 3 blinded, independent central readers evaluated the scans. Verified detection rate is equivalent to the overall detection rate × positive predictive value. Standard of truth was established for each patient using histopathology or confirmatory imaging. Statistical thresholds (lower bounds of the confidence intervals) of 36.5% and 62.5% were prespecified for verified detection rate and combined region-level positive predictive value, respectively. Additional end points included detection rate, verified detection rate, and combined region-level positive predictive value in patients with histopathology standard of truth, and safety.  Results:   The overall 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 detection rate among all 389 patients with an evaluable scan was 83% (majority read). Among the 366 patients (median prostate-specific antigen 1.27 ng/mL) for whom a standard of truth (histopathology [n=69]/confirmatory imaging only [n=297]) was available, verified detection rate ranged from 51% (95% CI 46.1-56.6) to 54% (95% CI 48.8-59.3), exceeding the prespecified statistical threshold. Combined region-level positive predictive value ranged from 46% (95% CI 42.0-50.3) to 60% (95% CI 55.1-65.5) across the readers, not meeting the threshold. In the subset of patients with histopathology standard of truth, the verified detection rate and combined region-level positive predictive value were both above the prespecified thresholds (majority read, 81% [95% CI 69.9-89.6] and 72% [95% CI 62.5-80.7], respectively). No significant safety concerns were identified.  Conclusions: 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 offers a clinically meaningful verified detection rate for localization of recurrent prostate cancer.

We interrogated the molecular features of ATM- and BRCA2-mutated mPC to explain the divergent clinical outcomes and inform future treatment decisions.  Experimental design:   We examined a novel set of 1,187 mPCs after excluding microsatellite-instable (MSI) tumors. We stratified these based on ATM (n = 88) or BRCA2 (n = 98) mutations. As control groups, mPCs with mutations in 12 other homologous recombination repair (HRR) genes were considered non-BRCA2/ATM HRR-deficient (HRDother, n = 193), whereas lack of any HRR mutations were considered HRR-proficient (HRP; n = 808). Gene expression analyses were performed using Limma. Real-world overall survival was determined from insurance claims data.  Results:   In noncastrate mPCs, only BRCA2-mutated mPCs exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. In castrate mPCs, both ATM and BRCA2 mutations exhibited worse clinical outcomes to AR-targeted therapies. ATM-mutated mPCs had reduced TP53 mutations and harbored coamplification of 11q13 genes, including CCND1 and genes in the FGF family. BRCA2-mutated tumors showed elevated genomic loss-of-heterozygosity scores and were often tumor mutational burden high. BRCA2-mutated mPCs had upregulation of cell-cycle genes and were enriched in cell-cycle signaling programs. This was distinct from ATM-mutated tumors.  Conclusions:   Tumoral ATM and BRCA2 mutations are associated with differential clinical outcomes when patients are stratified by treatments, including hormonal or taxane therapies. ATM- and BRCA2-mutated tumors exhibited differences in co-occurring molecular features. These unique molecular features may inform therapeutic decisions and development of novel therapies.""","""['Justin Hwang#', 'Xiaolei Shi#', 'Andrew Elliott#', 'Taylor E Arnoff#', 'Julie McGrath', 'Joanne Xiu', 'Phillip Walker', 'Hannah E Bergom', 'Abderrahman Day', 'Shihab Ahmed', 'Sydney Tape', 'Allison Makovec', 'Atef Ali', 'Rami M Shaker', 'Eamon Toye', 'Rachel Passow', 'John R Lozada', 'Jinhua Wang', 'Emil Lou', 'Kent W Mouw', 'Benedito A Carneiro', 'Elisabeth I Heath', 'Rana R McKay', 'W Michael Korn', 'Chadi Nabhan', 'Charles J Ryan', 'Emmanuel S Antonarakis']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Cancer Res""","""['Differential responses to taxanes and PARP inhibitors in ATM-\xa0versus BRCA2-mutated metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Genomic Biomarkers and Genome-Wide Loss-of-Heterozygosity Scores in Metastatic Prostate Cancer Following Progression on Androgen-Targeting Therapies.', 'Differential Response to Olaparib Treatment Among Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer Harboring BRCA1 or BRCA2 Versus ATM Mutations.', 'Homologous Recombination Defects and Mutations in DNA Damage Response (DDR) Genes Besides BRCA1 and BRCA2 as Breast Cancer Biomarkers for PARP Inhibitors and Other DDR Targeting Therapies.', 'Emerging Role of PARP Inhibitors in Metastatic Prostate Cancer.']"""

In our study, we evaluated the effects of the BrB flavonoid on cell viability (MTT, resazurin, and lactate dehydrogenase assays), proliferation (protein dosage and clonogenic assay), and migration/invasion (3D ECM gel, wound-healing, and transwell assays) of metastatic prostate (DU145) cells cultured both as traditional 2D monolayers and 3D tumor spheroids in vitro. The results showed that the BrB flavonoid promotes cytotoxic effects from ≥1.50 μM after 24 h of treatment in DU145 cells in monolayers. In 3D prostate tumor spheroids, BrB also induced cytotoxic effects at higher concentrations after longer treatment (48, 72, and 168 h). Furthermore, BrB treatment is associated with reduced DU145 clonogenicity in 2D cultures, as well as decreased area/volume of 3D tumor spheroids. Finally, BrB (6 μM) reduced cell migration/invasion in 2D monolayers and promoted antimigratory effects in DU145 tumor spheroids (≥30 μM).

Machine learning (ML) models have shown promising results in predicting outcomes, yet the lack of transparency in complex models known as ""black-box"" has made clinicians wary of relying on them in sensitive decisions. Therefore, finding a balance between accuracy and explainability is crucial for the implementation of ML models. The aim of this study was to employ three different ML classifiers to predict the probability of experiencing UI in men with localized prostate cancer 1-year and 2-year after treatment and compare their accuracy and explainability.  Methods:   We used the ProZIB dataset from the Netherlands Comprehensive Cancer Organization (Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland; IKNL) which contained clinical, demographic, and PROM data of 964 patients from 65 Dutch hospitals. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms were applied to predict (in)continence after prostate cancer treatment.  Results:   All models have been externally validated according to the TRIPOD Type 3 guidelines and their performance was assessed by accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. While all three models demonstrated similar performance, LR showed slightly better accuracy than RF and SVM in predicting the risk of UI one year after prostate cancer treatment, achieving an accuracy of 0.75, a sensitivity of 0.82, and an AUC of 0.79. All models for the 2-year outcome performed poorly in the validation set, with an accuracy of 0.6 for LR, 0.65 for RF, and 0.54 for SVM.  Conclusion:   The outcomes of our study demonstrate the promise of using non-black box models, such as LR, to assist clinicians in recognizing high-risk patients and making informed treatment choices. The coefficients of the LR model show the importance of each feature in predicting results, and the generated nomogram provides an accessible illustration of how each feature impacts the predicted outcome.

Meanwhile, prostate cancer (PCa) is an immune-sensitive tumor, making it essential to investigate the value of macrophage-associated networks in its prognosis and treatment.  Methods:   Macrophage-related marker genes (MRMGs) were identified through the comprehensive analysis of single-cell sequencing data from GSE141445 and the impact of macrophages on PCa was evaluated using consensus clustering of MRMGs in the TCGA database. Subsequently, a macrophage-related marker gene prognostic signature (MRMGPS) was constructed by LASSO-Cox regression analysis and grouped based on the median risk score. The predictive ability of MRMGPS was verified by experiments, survival analysis, and nomogram in the TCGA cohort and GEO-Merged cohort. Additionally, immune landscape, genomic heterogeneity, tumor stemness, drug sensitivity, and molecular docking were conducted to explore the relationship between MRMGPS and the tumor immune microenvironment, therapeutic response, and drug selection.  Results:   We identified 307 MRMGs and verified that macrophages had a strong influence on the development and progression of PCa. Furthermore, we showed that the MRMGPS constructed with 9 genes and the predictive nomogram had excellent predictive ability in both the TCGA and GEO-Merged cohorts. More importantly, we also found the close relationship between MRMGPS and the tumor immune microenvironment, therapeutic response, and drug selection by multi-omics analysis.

Intermediate- and high-risk PCa can be treated with either surgery or radiation, therefore we designed a study to assess the magnitude of race-based differences in cancer-specific survival between these two treatment modalities.  Methods:   Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) men with localized intermediate- and high-risk PCa, treated with surgery or radiation between 2004 and 2015 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database were included in the study and followed until December 2018. Unadjusted and adjusted survival analyses were employed to compare cancer-specific survival by race and treatment modality. A model with an interaction term between race and treatment was used to assess whether the type of treatment amplified or attenuated the effect of race/ethnicity on prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM).  Results:   15,178 (20.1%) NHB and 60,225 (79.9%) NHW men were included in the study. NHB men had a higher cumulative incidence of PCSM (p = 0.005) and were significantly more likely to be treated with radiation than NHW men (aOR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.81-1.97, p < 0.001). In the adjusted models, NHB men were significantly more likely to die from PCa compared with NHW men (aHR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.03-1.35, p = 0.014), and radiation was associated with a significantly higher odds of PCSM (aHR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.85-2.38, p < 0.001) compared with surgery. Finally, the interaction between race and treatment on PCSM was not significant, meaning that no race-based differences in PCSM were found within each treatment modality.  Conclusions:   NHB men with intermediate- and high-risk PCa had a higher rate of PCSM than NWH men in a large national cancer registry, though NHB and NHW men managed with the same treatment achieved similar PCa survival outcomes.

This study extends this comparison using the most recent data of 2014-2018.  Methods:   This study used publicly available cancer mortality and incidence data of New Zealand Ministry of Health and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and resident population data of Statistics New Zealand. Australian cancer mortality and incidence rates were applied to New Zealand population, by site of cancer, year, age and sex, to estimate the expected numbers, which were compared with the New Zealand observed numbers.  Results:   For total cancers in 2014-2018, New Zealand had 780 excess deaths in women (17.1% of the annual total 4549; 95% confidence interval (CI) 15.8-18.4%), and 281 excess deaths in men (5.5% of the annual total 5105; 95% CI 4.3-6.7%) compared to Australia. The excess was contributed by many major cancers including colorectal, melanoma, and stomach cancer in both sexes; lung, uterine, and breast cancer in women, and prostate cancer in men. New Zealand's total cancer incidences were lower than those expected from Australia's in both women and men: average annual difference of 419 cases (-3.6% of the annual total 11 505; 95% CI -4.5 to -2.8%), and 1485 (-11.7% of the annual total 12 669; 95% CI -12.5 to -10.9%), respectively. Comparing time periods, the excesses in total cancer deaths in women were 15.1% in 2000-07, and 17.5% in 1996-1997; and in men 4.7% in 2000-2007 and 5.6% in 1996-1997.

Methods:   We identified prostate cancer patients captured by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 2018 to 2019. Our exposure was receipt of cancer care at a facility accredited by the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer (CoC) providing eligibility for inclusion in the National Cancer Database (NCDB). Outcomes included patient demographics, tumor factors (e.g., biopsy grade), and treatment with radical prostatectomy.  Results:   We identified 113,733 prostate cancer patients of whom 65,708 (57%) were NCDB-eligible with an analytic abstract, and 11,010 (10%) were NCDB-eligible without an analytic abstract. NCDB-eligible men were younger (67.0 vs. 68.1 years, P < 0.001), less likely to be Hispanic/Latino (8.7% vs. 13.2%, P < 0.001), and more likely in a county with median income over $75,000 (40.9% vs. 30.0%, P < 0.001). NCDB eligibility varied widely by registry, from 95.9% in Connecticut to 42.6% in Utah. NCDB-ineligible patients were more likely to have unknown stage (17.2% vs. 2.9% NCDB-eligible) and missing PSA (22.9% vs 9.3% NCDB-eligible). NCDB-eligible men were less likely to have Grade Group 1 cancer on biopsy (28.2% vs. 39.2%, P < 0.001). Treatment with prostatectomy was more common among NCDB-eligible patients for low-risk (19.6% vs. 8.8%, adjusted OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.72-6.66) and high-risk tumors (43.5% vs. 26.0%, adjusted OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.33-2.86).

This requires a synthetic CT (sCT) for dose calculations, which can be facilitated by a novel Zero Echo Time (ZTE) sequence where bones are visible and images are acquired in 65 seconds. This study evaluated the dose calculation accuracy for pelvic sites of a ZTE-based Deep Learning sCT algorithm developed by GE Healthcare.  Materials and methods:   ZTE and CT images were acquired in 56 pelvic radiotherapy patients in the radiotherapy position. A 2D U-net convolutional neural network was trained using pairs of deformably registered CT and ZTE images from 36 patients. In the remaining 20 patients the dosimetric accuracy of the sCT was assessed using cylindrical dummy Planning Target Volumes (PTVs) positioned at four different central axial locations, as well as the clinical treatment plans (for prostate (n = 10), rectum (n = 4) and anus (n = 6) cancers). The sCT was rigidly and deformably registered, the plan recalculated and the doses compared using mean differences and gamma analysis.  Results:   Mean dose differences to the PTV D98% were ≤ 0.5% for all dummy PTVs and clinical plans (rigid registration). Mean gamma pass rates at 1%/1 mm were 98.0 ± 0.4% (rigid) and 100.0 ± 0.0% (deformable), 96.5 ± 0.8% and 99.8 ± 0.1%, and 95.4 ± 0.6% and 99.4 ± 0.4% for the clinical prostate, rectum and anus plans respectively.

However, previous research has shown non-patient-related factors often drive PCa treatment. In this context, we characterized trends in AS with respect to disease risk and health status.  Methods and materials:   Using SEER-Medicare data, we identified men 66 years and older diagnosed with localized low- and intermediate-risk PCa from 2008 to 2017 and examined receipt of EM, defined as the absence of treatment (i.e., surgery, cryotherapy, radiation, chemotherapy, and androgen deprivation therapies) within 1 year of diagnosis. We performed bivariable analysis to compare trends in use for EM vs. treatment, stratified by disease risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3, 3+4, 4+3; PSA<10, 10-20) and health status (i.e., NCI Comorbidity Index (NCI), frailty, life expectancy). We then ran a multivariable logistic regression model to examine determinants of EM.  Results:   Within this cohort, 26,364 (38%) were categorized as low-risk (i.e., Gleason 3+3 and PSA<10) and 43,520 (62%) as intermediate-risk (i.e., all others). Over the study period, use of EM significantly increased across all risk groups, except for Gleason 4+3 (P = 0.662), as well across all health status groups. However, linear trends did not differ significantly between frail vs. nonfrail patients for both those categorized as low-risk (P = 0.446) and intermediate-risk (P = 0.208). Trends also did not differ between NCI 0 vs. 1 vs. >1 for low-risk PCa (P = 0.395). In the multivariable models, EM was associated with increasing age and being frail for men with both low- and intermediate risk disease. Conversely, EM selection was negatively associated with higher comorbidity score.  Conclusions:   EM increased significantly over time for patients with low- and favorable intermediate-risk disease, with the most notable differences based on age and Gleason score. In contrast, trends in uptake of EM did not differ substantively by health status, suggesting that physicians may not be effectively incorporating patient health into PCa treatment decisions.

Using multicolor lineage tracing in genetically engineered mouse models and single-cell transcriptomics, we show that slowly progressing tumors contain a multiclonal landscape of relatively homogeneous subpopulations within a well-organized tumor microenvironment. In more advanced and aggressive tumors, however, the multiclonal landscape develops into competing dominant and minor clones accompanied by a disordered microenvironment. We demonstrate that this dominant/minor landscape is associated with differential immunoediting, in which minor clones are marked by an increased expression of IFNγ-response genes and the T cell-activating chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl11. Furthermore, immunomodulation of the IFNγ pathway can rescue minor clones from elimination. Notably, the immune-specific gene signature of minor clones exhibits a prognostic value for biochemical recurrence-free survival in human prostate cancer.

Rather than chronological age per se, the causality of hypogonadism includes obesity and impaired general health (e.g., metabolic syndrome). An association between testosterone deficiency and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) has been reported, yet due to prostate safety concerns, men with severe LUTS (IPSS score > 19) have invariably been excluded from entering testosterone trials. Irrespective, exogenous testosterone has not been demonstrated to cause de novo or worsen mild to moderate LUTS.  Objective:   This study investigated whether long-term testosterone therapy (TTh) could have a protective effect on improving the symptoms of LUTS in hypogonadal men. However, the exact mechanism by which testosterone exerts is beneficial effect remains uncertain.  Patients and methods:   In this study 321 hypogonadal patients with an average age of 58.9 ± 9.52 years received testosterone undecanoate in 12-week intervals for 12 years. One hundred and forty-seven of these males had the testosterone treatment interrupted for a mean of 16.9 months before it was resumed. Total testosterone, International Prostate Symptom Scale (IPSS), post-voiding residual bladder volume and aging male symptoms (AMS) were measured over the study period.  Results:   Prior to TTh interruption, it was observed that testosterone stimulation improved the men's IPSS, AMS and post-voiding residual bladder volume, while their prostate volume significantly increased. During the TTh interruption, there was a significant worsening in these parameters, although the increase in prostate volume continued. When TTh was resumed, these effects were reversed, implying that hypogonadism may require lifelong treatment.""","""['Aksam Yassin', 'Mustafa Alwani', 'Raed M Al-Zoubi', 'Omar M Aboumarzouk', 'Raidh Talib', 'Joanne Nettleship', 'Daniel Kelly', 'Bassam Albaba']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Effects of testosterone replacement therapy withdrawal and re-treatment in hypogonadal elderly men upon obesity, voiding function and prostate safety parameters.', 'Testosterone treatment and change of categories of the International prostate symptom score (IPSS) in hypogonadal patients: 12 years prospective controlled registry study.', 'Hypogonadal men with moderate-to-severe lower urinary tract symptoms have a more severe cardiometabolic risk profile and benefit more from testosterone therapy than men with mild lower urinary tract symptoms.', 'Controversies with testosterone therapy.', 'Effects of Testosterone Replacement Therapy on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.']"""

This often leads to genetic and translational adaptations that promote tumor progression, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to conventional chemo-/radiotherapy and immunotherapy. A hypoxia-directed nanosensitizer formulation of a hypoxia-activated prodrug (HAP) was developed by encapsulating iodoazomycin arabinofuranoside (IAZA), a 2-nitroimidazole nucleoside-based HAP, in a functionally modified carbohydrate-based nanogel, facilitating delivery and accrual selectively in the hypoxic head and neck and prostate cancer cells. Although IAZA has been reported as a clinically validated hypoxia diagnostic agent, recent studies have pointed to its promising hypoxia-selective anti-tumor properties, which make IAZA an excellent candidate for further exploration as a multimodal theranostic of hypoxic tumors. The nanogels are composed of a galactose-based shell with an inner core of thermoresponsive (di(ethylene glycol) methyl ethyl methacrylate) (DEGMA). Optimization of the nanogels led to high IAZA-loading capacity (≅80-88%) and a slow time-controlled release over 50 h. Furthermore, nanoIAZA (encapsulated IAZA) displayed superior in vitro hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity and radiosensitization in comparison to free IAZA in the head and neck (FaDu) and prostate (PC3) cancer cell lines. The acute systemic toxicity profile of the nanogel (NG1) was studied in immunocompromised mice, indicating no signs of toxicity. Additionally, growth inhibition of subcutaneous FaDu xenograft tumors was observed with nanoIAZA, demonstrating that this nanoformulation offers a significant improvement in tumor regression and overall survival compared to the control.""","""['Diana Diaz-Dussan', 'Yi-Yang Peng', 'Faisal Bin Rashed', 'Dawn Macdonald', 'Michael Weinfeld', 'Piyush Kumar', 'Ravin Narain']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Galactose-based Thermosensitive Nanogels for Targeted Drug Delivery of Iodoazomycin Arabinofuranoside (IAZA) for Theranostic Management of Hypoxic Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Cellular mechanism of action of 2-nitroimidazoles as hypoxia-selective therapeutic agents.', 'Influence of 2-Nitroimidazoles in the Response of FaDu Cells to Ionizing Radiation and Hypoxia/Reoxygenation Stress.', 'The chemistry and radiochemistry of hypoxia-specific, radiohalogenated nitroaromatic imaging probes.', 'Imaging hypoxia in tumors.']"""

The cohort comprised 23 men with BCR post-prostatectomy, median (minimum-maximum) prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 0.54 (0.11-2.50) ng/mL, and negative [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 scans 40 ± 28 d earlier. Primary endpoints were percentages of patients with, and classifications of, suspicious lesions.  Results:   Altogether, 18/23 patients (78%) had 36 suspicious lesions (minimum-maximum per patient: 1-4) on both 24-h and 48-h scans (n = 33 lesions) or only 48-h scans (n = 3 lesions). Only one lesion appeared on a 1-h scan. Lesions putatively represented local recurrence in 11 cases, and nodal or bone metastasis in 21 or 4 cases, respectively; 1/1 lesion was histologically confirmed as a nodal metastasis. In all 15 patients given radiotherapy based on [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT, PSA values decreased after this treatment. Comparison of PET variables in 24-h vs 48-h scans suggested no clear superiority of either regarding radiotracer uptake, but improved lesion-to-background ratio at 48 h.  Conclusions:   In men with BCR and low PSA, [89Zr]Zr-PSMA-617 PET/CT seems effective in finding prostate malignancy not seen on [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.

Methods:   The data of 565 patients receiving RP in a single institution between 2010 and 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. All suspicious tumor foci were delineated manually using ITK-SNAP software as the regions of interest (ROIs). The sum of the TV of all lesions was calculated automatically based on the voxel in the ROIs to acquire the final TV parameter. TV was categorized as low-volume (≤ 6.5 cm3) and high-volume (> 6.5 cm3) based on the cut-off value. Univariate and multivariate Cox and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of BCR and AP. The Kaplan-Meier with the log-rank test was conducted to compare the BCR-free survival (BFS) between the low and high-volume groups.  Results:   All the included patients were divided into the low-volume group (n = 337) and the high-volume group (n = 228). The TV was an independent predictor of BFS in the multivariate Cox regression analysis (Hazard Ratio (HR) [95% CI]: 1.550 [1.066-2.256], P = 0.022). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that low volume was associated with a better BFS than high volume before propensity score matching (PSM) (P < 0.001). One hundred and fifty-eight pairs were obtained by 1:1 PSM to balance the baseline parameters between the two groups. After the PSM, low-volume remained to be associated with a better BFS than high-volume (P = 0.006). TV as a categorical variable was an independent factor of AP in multivariate logistic regression analysis (Odd ratio (OR) [95% CI]: 1.821 [1.064-3.115], P = 0.029). After balancing the potential factors influencing AP by 1:1 PSM, 162 new pairs were identified. The high-volume group had a higher AP rate than the low-volume group after PSM (75.9 vs. 64.8%, P = 0.029).  Conclusion:   We adopted a novel approach to acquiring the TV on preoperative MRI. TV was significantly associated with BFS and AP of patients undergoing RP, which was further illustrated by PSM analysis.

Many studies suggested that TAMs cumulating in tumors correlate with a poor prognosis. In prostate cancer, TAMs can increase cancer cell invasion by stimulating tumor angiogenesis, degrading the extracellular matrix, and also suppresses the antitumor functions of cytotoxic T cells resulting in poor prognosis.  Aims and objectives:   : 1. To determine the expression of M1 (CD68) and M2 (CD163) in prostate carcinoma (Pca). 2. To find the association between M1, M2 macrophage with Gleason's score and stage of Pca.  Materials and methods:   : This is a retrospective observational study. All transurethral resection prostatic (TURP) chips positive for Pca and the clinical details were collected. Radiologic findings with respect to stage of disease, size of lesion, were noted.  Results:   Among the 62 cases studied, majority of the cases were in-between the age of 61-70 years.

M1 stage of (31%). CD68 and CD163 expression was analyzed with Gleason's score, TNM stage and PSA levels. CD68 score 3 correlated with low distant and nodal metastasis 6.2% and 6.8%, respectively. CD163 score 3 correlated with high metastasis to lymph nodes and distant metastasis of 86.3% and 25%, respectively. On further analysis, statistically convincing association between the CD163 expression and Gleason's score, PSA levels, nodal and distant metastasis was found.  Conclusion:   CD68 expression was correlated with good prognosis with less nodal and distant metastasis and Cd163 expression has poor outcome with increased chances of nodal and distant metastasis.

Settings and design:   This is a prospective and retrospective observational study.  Subjects and methods:   Poorly differentiated carcinomas of urinary tract and metastatic sites from January 2016 to December 2017 were subjected to a panel of four IHC markers including GATA-3, p63, Cytokeratin (CK) 7, and CK20. Additional markers such as p16, an enzyme called alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase, CDX2, and thyroid transcription factor 1 were also done depending on the morphology and site.  Statistical analysis used:   The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of GATA-3 in making the diagnosis of UC were calculated.  Results:   Forty-five cases were included in the study and after appropriate IHC, the diagnosis was resolved as UC in 24 cases. GATA-3 was positive in 83.33% of UC; all the four markers positive in 33.33% and all negative in 4.17% of UC. However, at least one of the four markers was present in 95.83% of UC, except in sarcomatoid UC. GATA-3 had 100% specificity in differentiating from prostate adenocarcinoma.  Conclusion:   GATA-3 is a useful marker in the diagnosis of UC in the primary and metastatic sites with a sensitivity of 83.33%.

Cabazitaxel (CBZ) is a next-generation semi-synthetic taxane derivative that is effective in both preclinical models of human tumors that are sensitive or resistant to chemotherapy and in patients suffering from progressive prostate cancer despite docetaxel treatment. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the ototoxicity of CBZ in a rat model.  Materials and methods:   : A total of 24 adult male Wistar-Albino rats were equally and randomly divided into four groups. CBZ (Jevtana, Sanofi-Aventis USA) was intraperitoneally administered to Groups 2, 3, and 4 at doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg/kg/week, respectively, for 4 consecutive weeks; Group 1 received only i.p. saline at the same time. At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed and their cochlea removed for histopathological examination.  Results:   : Intraperitoneal administration of CBZ exerted an ototoxic effect on rats, and the histopathological results became worse in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05).

Therefore, EMT regulation has become an important target in anticancer therapy approaches in recent years. However, in metastatic prostate cancer (PC), the EMT regulatory effect has not fully understood for cabazitaxel (Cbx), a third line taxane-based chemotherapeutic for metastatic castration-resistant PC.  Aim:   In this study, we investigated the antimetastatic and EMT-regulatory effects of Cbx on hormone-sensitive metastatic PC cells.  Materials and methods:   The anticancer effects of Cbx were assessed by WST-1 and Annexin V analysis. The antimetastatic effect of Cbx was evaluated by wound healing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction through EMT-mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) markers as well as EMT-repressor microRNAs (miRNAs) in Cbx-treated LNCaP cells.  Results:   Our results showed that, in addition to its apoptotic and anti-migratory activities, Cbx exhibited the EMT-repressor effects through the prominent downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 and Snail levels as EMT-promoting factors, and the significant upregulation of the certain miRNAs, including miR-205, miR-524, and miR-124, which play a role in EMT-repressing by targeting regulators of the EMT-associated genes.

Methods:   A prospective study was performed in 20 patients with advanced mCRPC. Of these, 16 underwent subsequent RLT with [177 Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 at a dose of 7.4 GBq every 6-8 weeks. PSMA expression on CTCs using the CellSearch system was compared to clinical and serological results, and to marker expression in targeted imaging and available histological sections of prostatectomy specimens (19% of RLT patients). Clinical outcome was obtained after two cycles of RLT.  Results:   Marked heterogeneity of PSMA expression was observed already at first diagnosis in available histological specimens. Targeted whole-body imaging also showed heterogeneous inter- and intra-patient PSMA expression between metastases. Heterogeneity of CTC PSMA expression was partially paralleled by heterogeneity of whole-body tumor burden PSMA expression. Twenty percent of CTC samples showed no PSMA expression, despite unequivocal PSMA expression of solid metastases at PET. A high fraction of PSMA-negative CTCs emerged as the sole predictor of poor RLT response (odds ratio [OR]: 0.9379 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.8558-0.9902]; p = 0.0160), and was prognostic for both shorter progression-free survival (OR: 1.236 [95% CI, 1.035-2.587]; p = 0.0043) and overall survival (OR: 1.056 [95% CI, 1.008-1.141]; p = 0.0182).

The high mobility of tumor cells is the key driving characteristic of metastasis. However, the mechanism is complex and far from clarified in PCa. Therefore, it is essential to explore the mechanism of metastasis and discover an intrinsic biomarker for mPCa.  Methods:   Transcriptome sequencing data and clinicopathologic features of PCa from multifarious public databases were used to identify novel metastatic genes in PCa. The PCa tissue cohort containing 102 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples was used to evaluate the clinicopathologic features of synaptotagmin-like 2 (SYTL2) in PCa. The function of SYTL2 was investigated by migration and invasion assays and a 3D migration model in vitro and a popliteal lymph node metastasis model in vivo. We performed coimmunoprecipitation and protein stability assays to clarify the mechanism of SYTL2.  Results:   We discovered a pseudopodia regulator, SYTL2, which correlated with a higher Gleason score, worse prognosis and higher risk of metastasis. Functional experiments revealed that SYTL2 promoted migration, invasion and lymph node metastasis by increasing pseudopodia formation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SYTL2 induced pseudopodia formation by enhancing the stability of fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) by binding and inhibiting the proteasome degradation pathway. Targeting FSCN1 enabled rescue and reversal of the oncogenic effect of SYTL2.  Conclusions:   Overall, our study established an FSCN1-dependent mechanism by which SYTL2 regulates the mobility of PCa cells. We also found that the SYTL2-FSCN1-pseudopodia axis may serve as a pharmacological and novel target for treating mPCa.""","""['Zean Li#', 'Yiran Tao#', 'Ze Gao#', 'Shirong Peng', 'Yiming Lai', 'Kaiwen Li', 'Xu Chen', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""['Down-regulation of miR-326 is associated with poor prognosis and promotes growth and metastasis by targeting FSCN1 in gastric cancer.', 'Restoration of miR-145 expression suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion in prostate cancer by targeting FSCN1.', 'N‑Myc induces the tumor progression of prostate cancer by regulating FSCN1.', 'The role and regulatory mechanism of FSCN1 in breast tumorigenesis and progression.', 'The post-translational modification of Fascin: impact on cell biology and its associations with inhibiting tumor metastasis.']"""

Unfortunately, the Phase III IMbassador250 clinical trial revealed that the combination of atezolizumab (a PD-L1 inhibitor) and enzalutamide failed to extend overall survival in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However, the mechanisms underlying treatment failure remain unknown.  Methods:   Human CRPC C4-2B cells and murine Myc-CaP cells were chronically exposed to increasing concentrations of enzalutamide and the cells resistant to enzalutamide were referred to as C4-2B MDVR and Myc-CaP MDVR, respectively. The mechanisms of action in drug-resistant prostate cancer cells were determined using RNA sequencing analyses, RNA interference, real-time PCR, western blotting, and co-culturing technologies. Myc-CaP and Myc-CaP MDVR tumors were established in syngeneic FVB mice, and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes were isolated after enzalutamide treatment. The stained immune cells were determined by flow cytometry, and the data were analyzed using FlowJo.  Results:   Immune-related signaling pathways (interferon alpha/gamma response, inflammatory response, and cell chemotaxis) were suppressed in human enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells. PD-L1 was overexpressed and negatively regulated by androgen receptor signaling in resistant cells and patient with CRPC cohorts. Enzalutamide treatment decreased CD8+ T-cell numbers but increased monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell (M-MDSC) populations and PD-L1 expression within murine Myc-CaP tumors. Similarly, chemotaxis and immune response-regulating signaling pathways were suppressed, and PD-L1 expression was also increased using enzalutamide-resistant Myc-CaP MDVR cells. Notably, MDSC populations were significantly increased in Myc-CaP MDVR orthotopic tumors compared with those in Myc-CaP parental tumors. Co-culturing bone marrow cells with Myc-CaP MDVR cells significantly promoted MDSC differentiation and shifted towards M2 macrophage skewing.  Conclusions:   Our study suggests that immunosuppressive signaling can be promoted directly by enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells and may be a potential means by which the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer is diminished.""","""['Pengfei Xu#', 'Joy C Yang#', 'Bo Chen', 'Christopher Nip', 'Jonathan E Van Dyke', 'Xiong Zhang', 'Hong-Wu Chen', 'Christopher P Evans', 'William J Murphy', 'Chengfei Liu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Alterations of androgen receptor-regulated enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) contribute to enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting CPT1B as a potential therapeutic strategy in castration-resistant and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Molecular characterization of enzalutamide-treated bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Targeting persistent androgen receptor signaling in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in castration-resistant prostate cancer and therapeutic strategies to overcome it.']"""

Flutamide is known to cause severe adverse events, which includes idiosyncratic liver injury. However, details of the mechanism of these adverse reactions have not been elucidated. We investigated whether flutamide induces the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate inflammasomes. We also tested bicalutamide, enzalutamide, apalutamide, and darolutamide for their ability to activate inflammasomes in differentiated THP-1 cells. The supernatant from the incubation of flutamide and bicalutamide with human hepatocarcinoma functional liver cell-4 (FLC-4) cells increased caspase-1 activity and production of IL-1ß by differentiated THP-1 cells. In the supernatant of FLC-4 cells with flutamide and bicalutamide, the heat shock protein (HSP) 40 or 60 was significantly increased. Addition of a carboxylesterase or a CYP inhibitor to the FLC-4 cells prevented release of HSPs from the FLC-4 cells. These results suggested that the reactive metabolites of flutamide and bicalutamide can cause the release of DAMPs from hepatocytes and activate inflammasomes. Inflammasome activation may be an important step in the activation of the immune system by flutamide or bicalutamide, which in some patients, can cause immune-related adverse events.""","""['Ryuji Kato', 'Tomoyuki Yamada', 'Takumi Noda', 'Saori Tanaka', 'Yuka Kohda', 'Yoshio Ijiri']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Toxicol In Vitro""","""['Amiodarone, Unlike Dronedarone, Activates Inflammasomes via Its Reactive Metabolites: Implications for Amiodarone Adverse Reactions.', 'Reactive metabolite of gefitinib activates inflammasomes: implications for gefitinib-induced idiosyncratic reaction.', 'Supernatant from Hepatocyte Cultures with Drugs That Cause Idiosyncratic Liver Injury Activates Macrophage Inflammasomes.', 'Which is the optimal antiandrogen for use in combined androgen blockade of advanced prostate cancer?

Materials and methods:   This retrospective, multicenter analysis included 1222 patients referred for PSMA-PET after a radical prostatectomy due to BR. Exclusion criteria were: pathological lymph node metastases, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) persistence, distant or lymph node metastases, nodal irradiation, and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). This led to a cohort of 341 patients. Biochemical progression-free survival (BPFS) was the primary study endpoint.  Results:   The median follow-up was 28.0 months. The 3-year BPFS was 71.6% in PET-negative cases and 80.8% in locally PET-positive cases.

Several prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed ligands labeled with 111 In, 99m Tc, and 68 Ga have been published; however, limitations regarding availability, short half-life, high costs, and unfavorable high energy might restrict frequent use. This study aims at introducing 67 Ga as a promising radionuclide for radioguided surgery.  Methods:   Retrospective analysis was performed on 6 patients with 7 PSMA-positive lymph node metastases. 67 Ga-PSMA I&T (imaging and therapy) was synthesized in-house and intravenously applied according to §13 2b of the German Medicinal Products Act. Radioguided surgery was performed 24 hours after injection of 67 Ga-PSMA I&T using a gamma probe. Patient urine samples were collected. Occupational and waste dosimetry was performed to describe hazards arising from radiation.  Results:   67 Ga-PSMA application was tolerated without adverse effects. Five of 7 lymph nodes were detected on 22-hour SPECT/CT in 4 of 6 patients. During surgery, all 7 lymph node metastases were identified by positive gamma probe signal. Relevant accumulation of 67 Ga was observed in lymph node metastases (32.1 ± 15.1 kBq). Histology analysis of near-field lymph node dissection revealed more lymph node metastases than PET/CT (and gamma probe measurements) identified. Waste produced during inpatient stay required decay time of up to 11 days before reaching exemption limits according to German regulations.  Conclusions:   Radioguided surgery using 67 Ga-PSMA I&T is a safe and feasible option for patients suffering from biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. 67 Ga-PSMA I&T was successfully synthesized according to Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines. Radioguided surgery with 67 Ga-PSMA I&T does not lead to relevant radiation burden to urology surgeons and represents a novel interdisciplinary approach in nuclear medicine and urology.""","""['Thomas Winkens', 'Frank Peter Berger', 'Susan Foller', 'Julia Greiser', 'Sebastian Groeber', 'Marc-Oliver Grimm', 'Martin Freesmeyer', 'Christian Kuehnel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Clin Nucl Med""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '99mTc-PSMA targeted robot-assisted radioguided surgery during radical prostatectomy and extended lymph node dissection of prostate cancer patients.', 'Robot-Assisted Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Radioguided Surgery in Primary Diagnosed Prostate Cancer.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen-guided salvage lymph node dissection in recurrent prostate cancer: a novel technology to detect lymph node metastases.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.']"""

However, the mechanisms underlying platelet hyperactivation are poorly understood.  Methods:   Murine and human platelets were isolated and treated with small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from various cancer cell lines. The effects of these cancer-sEVs on platelets were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using various approaches, including the detection of cancer-sEV-specific markers in murine platelets and patient samples, measurement of platelet activation and thrombosis assays. Signaling events induced by cancer-sEVs and leading to platelet activation were identified, and the use of blocking antibodies to prevent thrombosis was demonstrated.  Results:   We demonstrate that platelets very effectively take up sEVs from aggressive cancer cells. The process of uptake is fast, proceeds effectively in circulation in mice, and is mediated by the abundant sEV membrane protein-CD63. The uptake of cancer-sEVs leads to the accumulation of cancer cell-specific RNA in platelets in vitro and in vivo. The human prostate cancer-sEV-specific RNA marker PCA3 is detected in platelets of ~70% of prostate cancer patients. This was markedly reduced after prostatectomy. In vitro studies showed that platelet uptake of cancer-sEVs induces strong platelet activation in a CD63-RPTPα (receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase alpha)-dependent manner. In contrast to physiological agonists ADP and thrombin, cancer-sEVs activate platelets via a noncanonical mechanism. Intravital studies demonstrated accelerated thrombosis both in murine tumor models and in mice that received intravenous injections of cancer-sEVs. The prothrombotic effects of cancer-sEVs were rescued by blocking CD63.  Conclusions:   Tumors communicate with platelets by means of sEVs, which deliver cancer markers and activate platelets in a CD63-dependent manner leading to thrombosis. This emphasizes the diagnostic and prognostic value of platelet-associated cancer markers and identifies new pathways for intervention.""","""['Tejasvi Dudiki', 'Manoj Veleeparambil', 'Irina Zhevlakova', 'Sudipta Biswas', 'Eric A Klein', 'Peter Ford', 'Eugene A Podrez', 'Tatiana V Byzova']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Circ Res""","""['Tumor Cell EnVoys Advance the Education of Platelets.', 'TLR2 Plays a Key Role in Platelet Hyperreactivity and Accelerated Thrombosis Associated With Hyperlipidemia.', 'Single vesicle analysis reveals the release of tetraspanin positive extracellular vesicles into circulation with high intensity intermittent exercise.', 'Characterization of Plasma-Derived Small Extracellular Vesicles Indicates Ongoing Endothelial and Platelet Activation in Patients with Thrombotic Antiphospholipid Syndrome.', 'Platelets and cancer-associated thrombosis: focusing on the platelet activation receptor CLEC-2 and podoplanin.', 'Activation and inhibitory mechanisms of blood platelets.']"""

The inability of T cells to eliminate tumor cells despite an increase in their number reinforces the possibility of impaired antigen presentation. In this study, we investigated the TME at single-cell resolution to understand the molecular function and communication of dendritic cells (DCs) (as professional antigen-presenting cells). According to our data, tumor cells stimulate the migration of immature DCs to the tumor site by inducing inflammatory chemokines. Many signaling pathways such as TNF-α/NF-κB, IL2/STAT5, and E2F up-regulated after DCs enter the tumor location. In addition, some molecules such as GPR34 and SLCO2B1 decreased on the surface of DCs. The analysis of molecular and signaling alterations in DCs revealed some suppression mechanisms of tumors, such as removing mature DCs, reducing the DC's survival, inducing anergy or exhaustion in the effector T cells, and enhancing the differentiation of T cells to Th2 and Tregs. In addition, we investigated the cellular and molecular communication between DCs and macrophages in the tumor site and found three molecular pairs including CCR5/CCL5, CD52/SIGLEC10, and HLA-DPB1/TNFSF13B. These molecular pairs are involved in the migration of immature DCs to the TME and disrupt the antigen-presenting function of DCs.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has become the first-line therapy for inhibiting PCa progression; however, nearly all patients receiving ADT eventually progress to castrate-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to identify hub genes related to bicalutamide resistance in PCa and provide new insights into endocrine therapy resistance.  Methods:   The data were obtained from public databases. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to identify the gene modules related to bicalutamide resistance, and the relationship between the samples and disease-free survival was analyzed. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses were performed, and hub genes were identified. The LASSO algorithm was used to develop a bicalutamide resistance prognostic model in patients with PCa, which was then verified. Finally, we analyzed the tumor mutational heterogeneity and immune microenvironment in both groups.  Results:   Two drug resistance gene modules were identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses revealed that both modules are involved in RNA splicing. The protein-protein interaction network identified 10 hub genes in the brown module LUC7L3, SNRNP70, PRPF3, LUC7L, CLASRP, CLK1, CLK2, U2AF1L4, NXF1, and THOC1) and 13 in the yellow module (PNN, PPWD1, SRRM2, DHX35, DMTF1, SALL4, MTA1, HDAC7, PHC1, ACIN1, HNRNPH1, DDX17, and HDAC6). The prognostic model composed of RNF207, REC8, DFNB59, HOXA2, EPOR, PILRB, LSMEM1, TCIRG1, ABTB1, ZNF276, ZNF540, and DPY19L2 could effectively predict patient prognosis. Genomic analysis revealed that the high- and low-risk groups had different mutation maps. Immune infiltration analysis showed a statistically significant difference in immune infiltration between the high- and low-risk groups, and that the high-risk group may benefit from immunotherapy.  Conclusion:   In this study, bicalutamide resistance genes and hub genes were identified in PCa, a risk model for predicting the prognosis of patients with PCa was constructed, and the tumor mutation heterogeneity and immune infiltration in high- and low-risk groups were analyzed.

The primary endpoints were the incidence of PCA and the survival rate. A total of 21 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimates showed that exposure to hydrophilic statins was not associated with the incidence of PCA (odds ratio [OR]=0.94, 95% CI=0.88-1.01, P =0.075), while the incidence of PCA was significantly decreased in populations exposed to lipophilic statins compared with the nonexposed group (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.90-0.98, P =0.001), mainly in Western countries (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.91-0.98, P =0.006).

We included patients with Gleason score 6 at diagnostic biopsy, <34% positive cores and a first surveillance biopsy in a PASS site <2 years after diagnosis. We dichotomized our population based on diagnostic biopsy location (on-PASS site vs off-PASS site) and used multivariable logistic regression to evaluate association with reclassification at first surveillance biopsy after controlling for possible confounders.

Metastatic tumours in general have a lower intratumour heterogeneity and a conserved karyotype, displaying only a modest increase in mutations, although frequencies of structural variants are elevated overall. Furthermore, highly variable tumour-specific contributions of mutational footprints of endogenous (for example, SBS1 and APOBEC) and exogenous mutational processes (for example, platinum treatment) are present. The majority of cancer types had either moderate genomic differences (for example, lung adenocarcinoma) or highly consistent genomic portraits (for example, ovarian serous carcinoma) when comparing early-stage and late-stage disease. Breast, prostate, thyroid and kidney renal clear cell carcinomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours are clear exceptions to the rule, displaying an extensive transformation of their genomic landscape in advanced stages. Exposure to treatment further scars the tumour genome and introduces an evolutionary bottleneck that selects for known therapy-resistant drivers in approximately half of treated patients.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) that uses abiraterone acetate (AA) is an effective second-line treatment for prostate cancer. However, approximately 20-40% of patients develop primary resistance to abiraterone post-treatment. In this study, we aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of abiraterone resistance in prostate cancer cells and the potential use of black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNS) for treating abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer. We first established abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer PC-3 cells and found that these cells have higher migration ability than normal prostate cancer cells. Using comparative transcriptomic and bioinformatics analyses between abiraterone-sensitive PC-3 and abiraterone-resistant PC-3 cells, we highlighted the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the biological processes related to prostate gland morphogenesis, drug response, immune response, angiogenesis. We further studied the therapeutic effects of BPNS. Our results show that BPNS reduced the proliferation and migration of abiraterone-resistant PC-3 cells. Bioinformatics analysis, including gene ontology, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes enrichment analysis, and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) of the DEGs, suggested that BPNS treatment controlled cancer cell proliferation, metastasis, and oncogenic signaling pathways. Furthermore, the IPA gene network highlighted the involvement of the MMP family, ATF, and notch families in the anti-prostate cancer function of BPNS. Our findings suggest that BPNS may have a chemotherapeutic function in treating abiraterone-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Haoyang Xu', 'Jiaqi Liu', 'Xiangkai Li', 'Jiawei Li', 'Xiao Lin', 'Zhuowei Li', 'Tong Dou', 'Li Gao', 'Rong Li', 'Keng Po Lai']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Bioorg Chem""","""['Abiraterone acetate in combination with androgen deprivation therapy compared to androgen deprivation therapy only for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer.', 'Abiraterone acetate/androgen deprivation therapy combination versus docetaxel/androgen deprivation therapy combination in advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis on safety and efficacy.', 'Association of Missense Polymorphism in HSD3B1 With Outcomes Among Men With Prostate Cancer Treated With Androgen-Deprivation Therapy or Abiraterone.', 'Abiraterone acetate plus prednisone in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (LATITUDE): final overall survival analysis of a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

B7 homolog 3 protein (B7-H3/CD276) is an immune checkpoint molecule and has emerged as a promising therapeutic target. However, much remains to be understood regarding B7-H3's role in cancer progression, predictive biomarkers for B7-H3-targeted therapy, and combinatorial strategies. Our multi-omics analyses identified B7-H3 as one of the most abundant immune checkpoints in prostate tumors containing PTEN and TP53 genetic inactivation. Here, we sought in vivo genetic evidence for, and mechanistic understanding of, the role of B7-H3 in PTEN/TP53-deficient prostate cancer. We found that loss of PTEN and TP53 induced B7-H3 expression by activating transcriptional factor Sp1. Prostate-specific deletion of Cd276 resulted in delayed tumor progression and reversed the suppression of tumor-infiltrating T cells and NK cells in Pten/Trp53 genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, we tested the efficacy of the B7-H3 inhibitor in preclinical models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). We demonstrated that enriched regulatory T cells and elevated programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in myeloid cells hinder the therapeutic efficacy of B7-H3 inhibition in prostate tumors. Last, we showed that B7-H3 inhibition combined with blockade of PD-L1 or cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) achieved durable antitumor effects and had curative potential in a PTEN/TP53-deficient CRPC model.

To date, there has a been a lack of useful circulating biomarkers available to veterinary oncology patients.  Methods:   Circulating plasma nucleosome concentrations were evaluated at diagnosis, throughout treatment and during remission monitoring for 40 dogs with lymphoma, acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma. Additionally, C-reactive protein and thymidine kinase-1 levels were recorded.  Results:   Plasma nucleosome concentrations were significantly higher at diagnosis and progressive disease than they were when dogs were in remission. All but two dogs had plasma nucleosome concentrations that returned to the low range during treatment. These two dogs had the shortest progression free and overall survival times. Dogs with the highest plasma nucleosome concentrations had a significantly shorter first progression free survival than dogs with lower plasma nucleosome concentrations at diagnosis.

Objective:   To investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and gastrointestinal (GI) cancer risk (colorectal cancer [CRC] and noncolorectal GI cancer) in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study was a secondary analysis of data from the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. Participants aged 55 to 74 years were enrolled and randomized to the intervention (screening group) or control group at 10 screening centers between November 8, 1993, and July 2, 2001. The initial analysis of PLCO Cancer Screening Trial data occurred after 13 years of follow-up or December 31, 2009, whichever came first. Participants were reconsented in 2011 and either continued follow-up or refused additional follow-up. For those who reconsented, follow-up for incident cancers continued until December 31, 2014, or death, whichever occurred first. Data analysis for this secondary analysis was performed from April 2022 through November 2022.  Exposures:   Body mass index and aspirin use, defined as the frequency of use of aspirin or aspirin-containing substances in the last 12 months.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcomes were the diagnoses of CRC and noncolorectal GI cancer. The association between BMI and cancer (CRC and noncolorectal GI cancer) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. The association between cancer risk and change in BMI was further analyzed at different ages, and an exploratory analysis was performed to evaluate GI cancer risk among aspirin users.  Results:   This analysis included 135 161 participants (median [range] age, 62 [55-78] years; 67 643 [50.0%] female). Overweight BMI in early adulthood (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37) and overweight BMI in middle adulthood (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.13-1.34) and later adulthood (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.32) as well as obese BMI in middle adulthood (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.38-1.75) and later adulthood (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.25-1.54) were associated with increased risk of CRC. Similar results were observed for the association with overall GI and non-CRC GI risk and BMI in middle and later adulthood. Maintaining overweight or obese BMI or increasing BMI to overweight or obese in later adulthood was also associated with increased CRC risk. Aspirin use 3 or more times per week did not significantly modify this association.  Conclusions and relevance:   In this secondary analysis of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, overweight and obese BMI in early and middle adulthood was associated with an elevated risk of CRC and noncolorectal GI cancers.

Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor antagonist for the treatment of CRPC and a strong inducer of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4. Hereby, enzalutamide potentially reduces the exposure of oxycodone, an opioid metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Our objective was to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction of enzalutamide and oxycodone.  Methods:   A prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, two-arm parallel study was performed. All patients received a single dose of 15 mg normal-release oxycodone. Patients in the enzalutamide arm (ENZ-arm) received enzalutamide 160 mg once daily. Plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its metabolites were quantified using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.  Results:   Twenty-six patients (13 ENZ-arm; 13 control arm) were enrolled in the study. Enzalutamide decreased the mean AUC0-8 h and Cmax of oxycodone with, respectively, 44.7% (p < 0.001) and 35.5% (p = 0.004) compared with the control arm. The AUC0-8 h and Cmax of the active metabolite oxymorphone were 74.2% (p < 0.001) and 56.0% (p = 0.001) lower in the ENZ-arm compared with the control arm. In contrast, AUC0-8 h and Cmax of the inactive metabolites noroxycodone and noroxymorphone were significantly increased by enzalutamide.

Here we report that silencing of transglutaminase-2 (TG2) expression by CRISPR-Cas9 is associated with upregulation of androgen receptor (AR) transcription in PCa cell lines. Knockout of TG2 reversed the migratory potential and anchorage independency of PC3 and DU145 cells and revealed a reduced level of mucin-1 (MUC1) RNA transcript through unbiased multi-omics profiling, which was restored by selective add-back of the truncated TG2 isoform (TGM2_v2). Silencing of AR resulted into increased MUC1 in TG2KO PC3 cells showing that TG2 affects transcriptional regulation of MUC1 via repressing AR expression. Treatment of PC3 WT cell line with TG2 inhibitor ZDON led to a significant increase in AR expression and decrease in MUC1. ZDON also blocked the formation of MUC1-multimers labelled with TG amine-donor substrates in reducing conditions, revealing for the first time a role for TG2, which we show to be externalised via extracellular vesicles, in MUC1 stabilisation via calcium-dependent transamidation. A specific antibody towards TGM2_v2 revealed its restricted nuclear location compared to the canonical long form of TG2 (TGM2_v1), which is predominantly cytosolic, suggesting that this form contributes to the previously suggested TG2-mediated NF-κB activation and AR transcriptional repression. As TGM2_v2 transcription was increased in biopsies of early-stage prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) patients compared to subjects presenting inflammatory prostatitis, and total TG2 protein expression significantly increased in PRAD versus normal tissue, the role of TG2 and its truncated form as a prostate malignancy marker is suggested.

The mutational signatures can be found using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). To extract the mutational signatures we have to assume a distribution for the observed mutational counts and a number of mutational signatures. In most applications, the mutational counts are assumed to be Poisson distributed, and the rank is chosen by comparing the fit of several models with the same underlying distribution and different values for the rank using classical model selection procedures. However, the counts are often overdispersed, and thus the Negative Binomial distribution is more appropriate.  Results:   We propose a Negative Binomial NMF with a patient specific dispersion parameter to capture the variation across patients and derive the corresponding update rules for parameter estimation. We also introduce a novel model selection procedure inspired by cross-validation to determine the number of signatures. Using simulations, we study the influence of the distributional assumption on our method together with other classical model selection procedures. We also present a simulation study with a method comparison where we show that state-of-the-art methods are highly overestimating the number of signatures when overdispersion is present. We apply our proposed analysis on a wide range of simulated data and on two real data sets from breast and prostate cancer patients. On the real data we describe a residual analysis to investigate and validate the model choice.  Conclusions:   With our results on simulated and real data we show that our model selection procedure is more robust at determining the correct number of signatures under model misspecification. We also show that our model selection procedure is more accurate than the available methods in the literature for finding the true number of signatures. Lastly, the residual analysis clearly emphasizes the overdispersion in the mutational count data.

Accumulating evidence favors the concept that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a stochastic process composed of multiple intermediate states instead of a single binary switch. Despite its significant role in promoting cancer aggressiveness, the current tissue-based risk stratification tools do not include any of the EMT phenotypes as a metric. As a proof-of-concept, the present study analyzes the temporal progression of EMT in transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) treated PC3 cells encompassing multifarious characteristics such as morphology, migration and invasion, gene expression, biochemical fingerprint, and metabolic activity. Our multimodal approach reinstates EMT plasticity in TGF-β treated PC3 cells. Further, it highlights that mesenchymal transition is accompanied by discernible changes in cellular morphometry and molecular signatures particularly in the range of 1800-1600 cm-1 and 3100-2800 cm-1 of Fourier-transformed infrared (FTIR) spectra signifying Amide III and lipid, respectively. Investigation of attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectra of extracted lipids from PC3 cell populations undergoing EMT identifies changes in stretching vibration at FTIR peaks at 2852, 2870, 2920, 2931, 2954, and 3010 cm-1 characteristics of fatty acids and cholesterol. Chemometric analysis of these spectra indicates that the level of unsaturation and acyl chain length of fatty acid coregister with differential epithelial/mesenchymal states of TGF-β treated PC3 cells. Observed changes in lipids also correlate with cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide dihydrogen (FADH2) levels and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate. In summary, our study establishes that morphological and phenotypic traits of epithelial/mesenchymal variants of PC3 cells concur with their respective biochemical and metabolic properties. It also underscores that spectroscopic histopathology has a definitive potential to refine the diagnosis of prostate cancer reckoning its molecular and biochemical heterogeneities.""","""['Deepmala Karmakar', 'Pooja Lahiri', 'Minakshi Bedi', 'Aritri Ghosh', 'Alok Ghosh', 'Ananya Barui', 'Shailendra Kumar Varshney', 'Basudev Lahiri', 'Sanghamitra Sengupta']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cell Biochem""","""['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition in prostate cancer is associated with quantifiable changes in nuclear structure.', 'Visualizing Dynamic Changes During TGF-β-Induced Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition.', 'Periostin Mediates TGF-β-Induced Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition in Prostate Cancer Cells.', ""Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopic signatures for lung cells' epithelial mesenchymal transition: A preliminary report."", 'TGF-β signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in cancer progression.']"""

However, this technique has some limitations, which limit its use in routine clinical practice. Therefore, the selection of suitable proatate lesions for this technique is worthy of our attention. Synthetic MRI (SyMRI) is capable of quantifying multiple relaxation parameters, which might have potential value in preprocedural evaluation for TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy of the prostate. The aim of our study is to examine the value of SyMRI quantitative parameters in preprocedural evaluation for TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy of the prostate.  Methods:   We prospectively selected 148 lesions in 137 patients who underwent prostate biopsy in our hospital. Next, 2-4 needles of TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy combined with 10 needles of system biopsy (SB) were used as the protocol for prostate biopsy. Before biopsy, the MAGiC sequences of the MRI images of the enrolled patients underwent post-processing, and the longitudinal relaxation time (T1), transverse relaxation time (T2), and proton density (PD) were extracted. The biopsy pathology results were used as a gold standard to compare the differences in SyMRI quantitative parameters between benign and malignant prostate lesions in the peripheral and transitional zones. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to confirm the optimal SyMRI quantitative parameter for prostate lesion benignancy/malignancy performance, and the cutoff values of these parameters were used for grouping the lesions. The single-needle biopsy prostate cancer (PCa)-positivity rates (number of positive biopsy needles/total biopsy needles) and PCa overall detection rates by TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy and SB were compared in different subgroups.  Results:   The T1 and T2 values can determine the benignancy/malignancy of prostate transition lesions(p < 0.01), and the T2 value has a greater diagnostic performance (p = 0.0376). The T2 value can determine the benignancy/malignancy of prostate peripheral lesions. The optimal diagnostic cutoff values for T2 were 77 and 81 ms, respectively. The single-needle PCa positivity rate of TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy was higher than SB for any prostate lesions in different subgroups (p < 0.01). However, only in the subgroup of transition zone lesions with T2 ≤ 77 ms, the PCa overall detection rate of TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy was significantly higher than that of SB (p = 0.031).  Conclusion:   SyMRI-T2 value can provide a theoretical basis for the selection of suitable lesions for TRUS/MRI fusion-guided biopsy.""","""['Haiyan Cao', 'Wenjuan Xu', 'Yan Xu', 'Xin Rong', 'Xiao Xiao', 'Hao Feng', 'Xiaoxiang Wang', 'Lei Wang', 'Tingyue Qi', 'Li Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['The value of relaxation time quantitative technique from synthetic magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and invasion assessment of prostate cancer.', 'Prospective randomized trial comparing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided in-bore biopsy to MRI-ultrasound fusion and transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy in patients with prior negative biopsies.', 'Targeted MRI/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy in men with previous prostate biopsies using a novel registration software and multiparametric MRI PI-RADS scores: first results.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'The diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and enhanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques in aiding the localisation of prostate abnormalities for biopsy: a systematic review and economic evaluation.']"""

We used the data of the carbon ion therapy planning CT and the four-weekly treatment CTs of 19 prostate cancer cases. Three CT-CT registration algorithms were used to register the treatment CTs to the planning CT. Intensity-based image registration uses CT voxel intensity information. Target-based image registration uses target position on the treatment CTs to register it to that on the planning CT. WEPL-based image registration registers the treatment CTs to the planning CT using WEPL values. Initial dose distributions were calculated using the planning CT with the lateral beam angles. The treatment plan parameters were optimized to administer the prescribed dose to the PTV on the planning CT. Weekly dose distributions using the three different algorithms were calculated by applying the treatment plan parameters to the weekly CT data. Dosimetry, including the dose received by 95% of the clinical target volume (CTV-D95), rectal volumes receiving > 20 Gy (RBE) (V20), > 30 Gy (RBE) (V30), and > 40 Gy (RBE) (V40), were calculated. Statistical significance was assessed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Interfractional CTV displacement over all patients was 6.0 ± 2.7 mm (19.3 mm maximum standard amount). WEPL differences between the planning CT and the treatment CT were 1.2 ± 0.6 mm-H2O (< 3.9 mm-H2O), 1.7 ± 0.9 mm-H2O (< 5.7 mm-H2O) and 1.5 ± 0.7 mm-H2O (< 3.6 mm-H2O maxima) with the intensity-based image registration, target-based image registration, and WEPL-based image registration, respectively.

Methods:   QIs were measured using a population-based retrospective cohort of patients with low-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2014. We developed 20 QIs through a modified Delphi approach with clinicians targeting the quality of AS care at the population level. QIs included structure (n=1), process of care (n=13), and outcome indicators (n=6). Abstracted pathology data were linked to cancer registry and administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. A total of 17 of 20 QIs could be applied based on available information in administrative databases. Variations in QI performance were explored according to patient age, year of diagnosis, and physician volume.  Results:   The cohort included 33,454 men with low-risk prostate cancer, with a median age of 65 years (IQR, 59-71 years) and a median prostate-specific antigen level of 6.2 ng/mL. Compliance varied widely for 10 process QIs (range, 36.6%-100.0%, with 6 [60%] QIs >80%). Initial AS uptake was 36.6% and increased over time.

Several lines of evidence indicate that AR induces a distinct transcriptional program after androgen deprivation in CRPCs. However, the mechanism triggering AR binding to a distinct set of genomic loci in CRPC and how it promotes CRPC development remain unclear. We demonstrate here that atypical ubiquitination of AR mediated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase TRAF4 plays an important role in this process. TRAF4 is highly expressed in CRPCs and promotes CRPC development. It mediates K27-linked ubiquitination at the C-terminal tail of AR and increases its association with the pioneer factor FOXA1. Consequently, AR binds to a distinct set of genomic loci enriched with FOXA1- and HOXB13-binding motifs to drive different transcriptional programs including an olfactory transduction pathway. Through the surprising upregulation of olfactory receptor gene transcription, TRAF4 increases intracellular cAMP levels and boosts E2F transcription factor activity to promote cell proliferation under androgen deprivation conditions. Altogether, these findings reveal a posttranslational mechanism driving AR-regulated transcriptional reprogramming to provide survival advantages for prostate cancer cells under castration conditions.""","""['Ramesh Singh', 'Huan Meng', 'Tao Shen', 'Lance Edward V Lumahan', 'Steven Nguyen', 'Hong Shen', 'Subhamoy Dasgupta', 'Li Qin', 'Dileep Karri', 'Bokai Zhu', 'Feng Yang', 'Cristian Coarfa', ""Bert W O'Malley"", 'Ping Yi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""['LncRNA HOTAIR Enhances the Androgen-Receptor-Mediated Transcriptional Program and Drives Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'Transcription of Nrdp1 by the androgen receptor is regulated by nuclear filamin A in prostate cancer.', 'FOXA1 regulates androgen receptor variant activity in models of castrate-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor: what we know and what we expect in castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Androgen receptor functions in castration-resistant prostate cancer and mechanisms of resistance to new agents targeting the androgen axis.']"""

Stimulated Raman histology (SRH) is a novel microscopic technique allowing real-time, label-free, high-resolution microscopic images of unprocessed, unsectioned tissue. This technology holds potential to decrease the time for PB diagnosis from days to minutes. We evaluated the concordance of pathologist interpretation of PB SRH as compared with traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides.  Methods:   Men undergoing prostatectomy were included in an IRB-approved prospective study. Ex vivo 18-gauge PB cores, taken from prostatectomy specimen, were scanned in an SRH microscope (NIO; Invenio Imaging) at 20 microns depth using two Raman shifts: 2845 and 2930 cm-1 , to create SRH images. The cores were then processed as per normal pathologic protocols. Sixteen PB containing a mix of benign and malignant histology were used as an SRH training cohort for four genitourinary pathologists, who were then tested on a set of 32 PBs imaged by SRH and processed by traditional H&E. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and concordance for prostate cancer (PCa) detection on SRH relative to H&E were assessed.  Results:   The mean pathologist accuracy for the identification of any PCa on PB SRH was 95.7%. In identifying any PCa or ISUP grade group 2-5 PCa, a pathologist was independently able to achieve good and very good concordance (κ: 0.769 and 0.845, respectively; p < 0.001). After individual assessment was completed a pathology consensus conference was held for the interpretation of the PB SRH; after the consensus conference the pathologists' concordance in identifying any PCa was also very good (κ: 0.925, p < 0.001; sensitivity 95.6%; specificity 100%).  Conclusion:   SRH produces high-quality microscopic images that allow for accurate identification of PCa in real-time without need for sectioning or tissue processing. The pathologist performance improved through progressive training, showing that ultimately high accuracy can be obtained. Ongoing SRH evaluation in the diagnostic and treatment setting hold promise to reduce time to tissue diagnosis, while interpretation by convolutional neural network may further improve diagnostic characteristics and broaden use.""","""['Miles P Mannas', 'Derek Jones', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Deepthi Hoskoppal', 'Jonathan Melamed', 'Daniel A Orringer', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Stimulated Raman histology as a method to determine the adequacy of renal mass biopsy and identify malignant subtypes of renal cell carcinoma.', 'Digital Biopsy with Fluorescence Confocal Microscope for Effective Real-time Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer: A Prospective, Comparative Study.', 'Toward digital histopathological assessment in surgery for central nervous system tumors using stimulated Raman histology.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Optimization of initial prostate biopsy in clinical practice: sampling, labeling and specimen processing.']"""

Experimental Design: First, we assessed the relationship between TRA (PODXL) copy number alterations (CNA) and survival using publicly available patient databases. The anti-TRA antibody, Bstrongomab, was radiolabeled with Zr-89 or Lu-177 for immunoPET imaging and RPT in PCa xenografts. Radiosensitive tissues were collected to assess radiotoxicity while excised tumors were examined for pathologic treatment response. Results: Patients with tumors having high PODXL CNA exhibited poorer progression-free survival than those with low PODXL, suggesting that it plays an important role in tumor aggressiveness. TRA-targeted immunoPET imaging specifically imaged CSCs in DU-145 xenografts. Tumors treated with TRA RPT exhibited delayed growth and decreased proliferative activity, marked by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Aside from minor weight loss in select animals, no significant signs of radiotoxicity were observed in the kidneys or livers. Conclusions: We successfully demonstrated the clinical significance of TRA expression in human PCa, engineered and tested radiotheranostic agents to image and treat TRA+ prostate CSCs. Ablation of TRA+ CSCs blunted PCa growth. Future studies combining CSC ablation with standard treatment will be explored to achieve durable responses.""","""['Jordan M White', 'Nicholas Ramos', 'Allen-Dexter Saliganan', 'Joon-Yong Chung', 'Meghan Bell', 'Jacob Lindquist', 'Kayla Conner', 'Wendy N Wiesend', 'Michael Schopperle', 'Steve M Patrick', 'Seongho Kim', 'Elisabeth I Heath', 'Freddy E Escorcia', 'Nerissa T Viola']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Theranostics""","""['Detecting TRA-1-60 in Cancer via a Novel Zr-89 Labeled ImmunoPET Imaging Agent.', 'More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', 'Evaluation of 131II- and 177LuLu-DTPA-A11 Minibody for Radioimmunotherapy in a Preclinical Model of PSCA-Expressing Prostate Cancer.', 'Radiopharmaceuticals for the Diagnosis and Therapy of Neuroendocrine Differentiated Prostate Cancer.', 'New Clinical Indications for (18)F/(11)C-choline, New Tracers for Positron Emission Tomography and a Promising Hybrid Device for Prostate Cancer Staging: A Systematic Review of the Literature.']"""

The cavitation effect induced by FUS is applied for histotripsy, support drug delivery, and the induction of blood vessel destruction for cancer therapy. Numerous studies report that cavitation-induced sonoporation could provoke multiple anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells. Therefore, cavitation alone or in combination with thermal treatment is of great interest but research in this field is inadequate. Methods: Human prostate cancer cells (LNCap and PC-3) were exposed to 40 s cavitation using a FUS system, followed by water bath hyperthermia (HT). The clonogenic assay, WST-1 assay, and Transwell® invasion assay, respectively, were used to assess cancer cell clonogenic survival, metabolic activity, and invasion potential. Fluorescence microscopy using propidium iodide (PI) as a probe of cell membrane integrity was used to identify sonoporation. The H2A.X assay and Nicoletti test were conducted in the mechanism investigation to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and cell cycle arrest. Immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry were performed to determine the distribution and expression of 5α-reductase (SRD5A). Results: Short FUS shots with cavitation (FUS-Cav) in combination with HT resulted in, respectively, a 2.2, 2.3, and 2.8-fold decrease (LNCap) and a 2.0, 1.5, and 1.6-fold decrease (PC-3) in the clonogenic survival, cell invasiveness and metabolic activity of prostate cancer cells when compared to HT alone. FUS-Cav immediately induced sonoporation in 61.7% of LNCap cells, and the combination treatment led to a 1.4 (LNCap) and 1.6-fold (PC-3) increase in the number of DSBs compared to HT alone. Meanwhile, the combination therapy resulted in 26.68% of LNCap and 31.70% of PC-3 with cell cycle arrest in the Sub-G1 phase and 35.37% of PC-3 with cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. Additionally, the treatment of FUS-Cav combined with HT block the androgen receptor (AR) signal pathway by reducing the relative Type I 5α-reductase (SRD5A1) level to 38.28 ± 3.76% in LNCap cells, and decreasing the relative Type III 5α-reductase 3 (SRD5A3) level to 22.87 ± 4.88% in PC-3 cells, in contrast, the relative SRD5A level in untreated groups was set to 100%. Conclusion: FUS-induced cavitation increases the effects of HT by interrupting cancer cell membranes, inducing the DSBs and cell cycle arrest, and blocking the AR signal pathway of the prostate cancer cells, with the potential to be a promising adjuvant therapy in prostate cancer treatment.""","""['Shaonan Hu', 'Xinrui Zhang', 'Andreas Melzer', 'Lisa Landgraf']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Genet""","""['Focused Ultrasound-Induced Cavitation Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Radiation Therapy and Hyperthermia.', 'Focused ultrasound radiosensitizes human cancer cells by enhancement of DNA damage.', 'Effect of compound Chinese traditional medicine PC-SPES II in inhibiting proliferation of human prostate cancer cell LNCaP and on expressions of AR and PSA.', 'SRJ23, a new semisynthetic andrographolide derivative: in vitro growth inhibition and mechanisms of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.', 'Nitroxide tempo, a small molecule, induces apoptosis in prostate carcinoma cells and suppresses tumor growth in athymic mice.']"""

Malignancy is associated with cell mechanic changes that contribute to extensive cell deformation required for metastatic dissemination. Thus, we established stiff and soft tumor subtypes for PCa patients from perspective of membrane tension.  Methods:   Nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm was used to identify molecular subtypes. We completed analyses using software R 3.6.3 and its suitable packages.  Results:   We constructed stiff and soft tumor subtypes using eight membrane tension-related genes through lasso regression and nonnegative matrix factorization analyses. We found that patients in stiff subtype were more prone to biochemical recurrence than those in soft subtype (HR 16.18; p < 0.001), which was externally validated in other three cohorts. The top ten mutation genes between stiff and soft subtypes were DNAH, NYNRIN, PTCHD4, WNK1, ARFGEF1, HRAS, ARHGEF2, MYOM1, ITGB6 and CPS1. E2F targets, base excision repair and notch signaling pathway were highly enriched in stiff subtype. Stiff subtype had significantly higher TMB and T cells follicular helper levels than soft subtype, as well as CTLA4, CD276, CD47 and TNFRSF25.

The immediate, early and long-term urinary continence rates were assessed in both groups, and the factors affecting urinary continence were analyzed.  Results:   The urinary continence rate at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months in the observation group after RP was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.0% vs. 29.7%, 70.0% vs. 39.1%, 82% vs. 57.8, 88% vs. 70.3%, 98.0 vs. 84.4%, p < 0.05). The contractile function of the external urinary sphincter was obviously correlated with urinary continence at multiple visits after RP, except for the 12-month visit. Transrectal ultrasound and urologist-dually guided PFME was verified to be an independent positive factor for urinary continence at 2 weeks and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months using logistic regression analysis.

Objective:   To provide long-term follow-up data from phase III RTOG 0521, which compared a combination of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) + external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) + docetaxel with ADT + EBRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   High-risk localized prostate cancer patients (>50% of patients had Gleason 9-10 disease) were prospectively randomized to 2 yr of ADT + EBRT or ADT + EBRT + six cycles of docetaxel. A total of 612 patients were accrued, and 563 were eligible and included in the modified intent-to-treat analysis.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Analyses with Cox proportional hazards were performed as prespecified in the protocol; however, there was evidence of nonproportional hazards. Thus, a post hoc analysis was performed using the restricted mean survival time (RMST). The secondary endpoints included biochemical failure, distant metastasis (DM) as detected by conventional imaging, and disease-free survival (DFS).  Results and limitations:   After 10.4 yr of median follow-up among survivors, the hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.89 (90% confidence interval [CI] 0.70-1.14; one-sided log-rank p = 0.22). Survival at 10 yr was 64% for ADT + EBRT and 69% for ADT + EBRT + docetaxel. The RMST at 12 yr was 0.45 yr and not statistically significant (one-sided p = 0.053). No differences were detected in the incidence of DFS (HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.73-1.14), DM (HR = 0.84, 95% CI 0.73-1.14), or prostate-specific antigen recurrence risk (HR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.74-1.29). Two patients had grade 5 toxicity in the chemotherapy arm and zero patients in the control arm.  Conclusions:   After a median follow-up of 10.4 yr among surviving patients, no significant differences are observed in clinical outcomes between the experimental and control arms. These data suggest that docetaxel should not be used for high-risk localized prostate cancer. Additional research may be warranted using novel predictive biomarkers.

Objective:   To evaluate outcomes for patients with oligometastatic and polymetastatic HSPC treated with enzalutamide plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) versus placebo plus ADT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This was a post hoc analysis of data for 927 patients with nonvisceral metastatic HSPC in the ARCHES trial (NCT02677896).  Intervention:   Patients were randomized 1:1 to enzalutamide (160 mg/d orally) plus ADT or placebo plus ADT with HSPC categorized as oligometastatic (1-5 metastases) or polymetastatic (≥6 metastases).  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   The treatment effect on radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), overall survival (OS), and secondary efficacy endpoints was evaluated in terms of the number of metastases. Safety was assessed. Cox proportional hazards models were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs). The Brookmeyer and Crowley method was used to generate 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for Kaplan-Meier median values.  Results and limitations:   Enzalutamide plus ADT improved rPFS (HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.46; p < 0.001), OS (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.40-0.87; p < 0.005), and secondary endpoints in patients with oligometastatic or polymetastatic disease (rPFS: HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.46; p < 0.001; OS: HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.74; p < 0.001). Safety profiles were generally similar across subgroups. Limitations include the small numbers of patients with fewer than three metastases.  Conclusions:   This post hoc analysis demonstrated the utility of enzalutamide, irrespective of metastatic burden or type of oligometastatic disease, and suggests that earlier treatment intensification with systemic potent androgen receptor inhibition is advantageous.

We investigated the methylation status of tumor-associated genes in patients who underwent RP.  Methods:   Patients who underwent RP during 2004 to 2008 were matched retrospectively based on post-operative D'Amico risk stratification. Quantitative pyrosequencing was used to analyze methylation status of 10 gene loci in cancerous and adjacent benign tissue from histological specimen. Follow-up was performed according to EAU guideline recommendations. Statistical analyses were performed to correlate methylation levels in cancerous and benign tissue with risk profiles and biochemical recurrence (BCR).  Results:   The cohort included 71 patients: 22 low-risk, 22 intermediate-risk, and 27 high-risk. Mean follow-up time was 74 months. Methylation status differed significantly between cancerous and adjacent benign tissue for the 5 gene loci GSTP1, APC, RASSF1, TNFRFS10c, and RUNX3 (each P < 0.001).

Methods and materials:   Eligible patients included low- or intermediate-risk prostate cancer (Gleason score ≤7, prostate specific antigen ≤20, T stage ≤2b). SBRT was prescribed to 40 Gy in 5 fractions delivered every other day to the prostate, with any areas of high disease burden (MRI-identified prostate imaging reporting and data system 4 or 5 lesions) simultaneously escalated to 42.5 to 45 Gy and areas overlapping organs at risk (within 2 mm of urethra, rectum, and bladder) constrained to 36.25 Gy (n = 100).

We investigated the association between family structure and living arrangements as potential indicators of social isolation, and prostate cancer risk, globally and according to disease aggressiveness. Data from the Prostate Cancer & Environment Study (PROtEuS), a case-control population-based study conducted between 2005 and 2012 in Montreal, Canada, were used. The study population comprised 1931 incident cases of prostate cancer, aged ≤75 years, and 1994 age-matched (±5 years) population controls. In-person interviews collected information on family composition and living arrangements recently and at age 40. Logistic regression estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for potential confounders. Single men had an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer at diagnosis (OR 1.80; 95% CI 1.29-2.51), compared to men currently married or with a partner. Having at least one daughter was associated with a lower risk of aggressive cancer (OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.61-0.96) while no association was found with having son(s). An inverse dose-response relationship was observed between the number of people living with the subject 2 years before diagnosis/interview and prostate cancer risk (p-trend<0.001). These results suggest a protective role of a rich personal environment on the risk of developing prostate cancer. As several of the associations studied here are novel, replication is required.""","""['Charlotte Salmon', 'Amélie Quesnel-Vallée', 'Marie-Élise Parent']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prev Med""","""['Circumcision and prostate cancer: a population-based case-control study in Montréal, Canada.', 'Marital status and prostate cancer incidence: a pooled analysis of 12 case-control studies from the PRACTICAL consortium.', 'Residential greenness and risk of prostate cancer: A case-control study in Montreal, Canada.', 'General and abdominal obesity trajectories across adulthood, and risk of prostate cancer: results from the PROtEuS study, Montreal, Canada.', 'Metabolic syndrome and prostate cancer risk in a population-based case-control study in Montreal, Canada.']"""

Methods:   An integrated genomics strategy was used to identify deoxyribonucleases correlating with genomic instability (as assessed from total copy number events in each patient) in 6 cancers. Apurinic/apyrimidinic nuclease 1 (APE1), identified as the top gene in functional screens, was either suppressed in cancer cell lines or overexpressed in normal esophageal cells and the impact on genome stability and growth was monitored in vitro and in vivo. The impact on DNA and chromosomal instability was monitored using multiple approaches, including investigation of micronuclei, acquisition of single nucleotide polymorphisms, whole genome sequencing, and/or multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization.  Results:   Expression of 4 deoxyribonucleases correlated with genomic instability in 6 human cancers. Functional screens of these genes identified APE1 as the top candidate for further evaluation. APE1 suppression in EAC, breast, lung, and prostate cancer cell lines caused cell cycle arrest; impaired growth and increased cytotoxicity of cisplatin in all cell lines and types and in a mouse model of EAC; and inhibition of homologous recombination and spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced genomic instability. APE1 overexpression in normal cells caused a massive chromosomal instability, leading to their oncogenic transformation. Evaluation of these cells by means of whole genome sequencing demonstrated the acquisition of changes throughout the genome and identified homologous recombination as the top mutational process.

Only error-free data were employed for the model training, and error-free and error data were employed for the tests. As a deep learning model, the variational autoencoder (VAE) was adopted. The anomaly of test data was quantified by calculating Mahalanobis distance based on the feature vectors acquired from a trained encoder. Based on this anomaly, test data were classified as 'error-free' or 'any-error.' For comparison with conventional approaches, gamma (γ)-analysis was performed, and supervised learning convolutional neural network (S-CNN) was constructed.

Despite the extensive amount of radiobiological data available, variability among different studies makes it very difficult to produce high-quality radiosensitivity biomarkers or predictive models. Here, we characterize a panel of 27 human cell lines, including those derived from lung cancer, prostate cancer, and normal tissues. In addition, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a panel of lines with known DNA repair defects. These cells were characterised by measuring a range of biological features, including the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), cell cycle distribution, ploidy, and clonogenic survival following X-ray irradiation. These results offer a robust dataset without inter-experimental variabilities for model development. In addition, we used these results to explore correlations between potential determinants of radiosensitivity. There was a wide variation in the intrinsic radiosensitivity of cell lines, with cell line Mean Inactivation Doses (MID) ranging from 1.3 to 3.4 Gy for cell lines, and as low as 0.65 Gy in Lig4-/- cells. Similar substantial variability was seen in the other parameters, including baseline DNA damage, plating efficiency, and ploidy. In the CRISPR-modified cell lines, residual DSBs were good predictors of cell survival (R2 = 0.78, p = 0.009), as were induced levels of DSBs (R2 = 0.61, p = 0.01). However, amongst the normal and cancerous cells, none of the measured parameters correlated strongly with MID (R2 < 0.45), and the only metrics with statistically significant associations are plating efficiency (R2 = 0.31, p = 0.01) and percentage of cell in S phase (R2 = 0.37, p = 0.005). While these data provide a valuable dataset for the modelling of radiobiological responses, the differences in the predictive power of residual DSBs between CRISPR-modified and other subgroups suggest that genetic alterations in other pathways, such as proliferation and metabolism, may have a greater impact on cellular radiation response. These pathways are often neglected in response modelling and should be considered in the future.""","""['Francisco D C Guerra Liberal', 'Stephen J McMahon']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['Intrinsic Radiosensitivity and Cellular Characterization of 27 Canine Cancer Cell Lines.', 'The role of DNA damage repair and Chk2 protein in hyper-radiosensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells.', 'Fibroblast radiosensitivity measured using the comet DNA-damage assay correlates with clonogenic survival parameters.', 'Irradiation induced foci (IRIF) as a biomarker for radiosensitivity.', 'Genetic variations in DNA repair genes, radiosensitivity to cancer and susceptibility to acute tissue reactions in radiotherapy-treated cancer patients.']"""

Herein, we compared the incidence of upgrading on biopsies that met criteria for ""For Cause"" surveillance biopsy (FCSBx) versus PPSBx.  Methods:   We retrospectively reviewed men with GG1 PC on AS in the Michigan Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative (MUSIC) registry. Surveillance prostate biopsies obtained 1 year after diagnosis were classified as either PPSBx or FCSBx. Biopsies were retrospectively deemed FCSBx if any of these criteria were met: PSA velocity > 0.75 ng/mL/year; rise in PSA > 3 ng from baseline; surveillance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (sMRI) with a PIRADS ≥ 4; change in DRE. Biopsies were classified PPSBx if none of these criteria were met. The primary outcome was upgrading to ≥GG2 or ≥GG3 on surveillance biopsy. The secondary objective was to assess for the association of reassuring (PIRADS ≤ 3) confirmatory or surveillance MRI findings and upgrading for patients undergoing PPSBx. Proportions were compared with the chi-squared test.  Results:   We identified 1773 men with GG1 PC in MUSIC who underwent a surveillance biopsy. Men meeting criteria for FCSBx had more upgrading to ≥GG2 (45%) and ≥GG3 (12%) compared with those meeting criteria for PPSBx (26% and 4.9%, respectively, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001).

The inconvenience of using different methods to detect PCa and its metastases in patients and the limitations of single-mode imaging have brought great challenges to clinicians. Meanwhile, clinical treatments for metastatic PCa are still limited. Herein, we report a targeted theranostic platform of Au/Mn nanodots-luteinising hormone releasing hormone (AMNDs-LHRH) nano-system for multi-mode imaging guided photothermal therapy of PCa. The nano-system not only can simultaneously target Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor (GnRH-R) positive PCa and its metastases for accurate preoperative CT/MR diagnosis, but also possesses fluorescence (FL) visualization navigated surgery, demonstrating its potential application in clinical cancer detection and surgery guidance. Meanwhile, the AMNDs-LHRH with promising targeting and photothermal conversion ability significantly improve the photothermal therapy effect of metastatic PCa. The AMNDs-LHRH nano-system guarantees the diagnostic accuracy and enhanced therapeutic effect, which provides a promising platform for clinical diagnosis and treatment of metastatic PCa.

Here, we show in lineage-tracing mouse models that although Wnt is essential for basal stem cell multipotency, ectopic Wnt activity promotes basal cell over-proliferation and squamous phenotypes, which are counteracted by elevated levels of androgen. In prostate basal cell organoids, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) antagonizes R-spondin-stimulated growth in a concentration-dependent manner. DHT down-regulates the expressions of a Wnt reporter and target genes, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses identify Wnt signaling as a key altered pathway. Mechanistically, DHT enhances AR and β-catenin protein binding, and CUT&RUN analyses reveal that ectopic AR sequesters β-catenin away from its Wnt-related cistrome.

While molecular mechanisms underlying resistance phenotypes have been explored, less is known about the cell biological characteristics of cancer cells that survive to eventually seed the recurrence. To identify the unique phenotypic characteristics associated with survival upon chemotherapy exposure, we characterized nuclear morphology and function as prostate cancer cells recovered following cisplatin treatment. Cells that survived in the days and weeks after treatment and resisted therapy-induced cell death showed increasing cell size and nuclear size, enabled by continuous endocycling resulting in repeated whole genome doubling. We further found that cells that survive after therapy release were predominantly mononucleated and likely employ more efficient DNA damage repair. Finally, we show that surviving cancer cells exhibit a distinct nucleolar phenotype and increased rRNA levels. These data support a paradigm where soon after therapy release, the treated population mostly contains cells with a high level of widespread and catastrophic DNA damage that leads to apoptosis, while the minority of cells that have successful DDR are more likely to access a pro-survival state. These findings are consistent with accession of the polyaneuploid cancer cell (PACC) state, a recently described mechanism of therapy resistance and tumor recurrence.

The BSCI was then tested with adults diagnosed with breast, gastrointestinal, lung, or prostate cancer (N = 404). Confirmatory factor analysis suggested a unidimensional structure, and internal consistency reliability was excellent. Construct validity of the BSCI was established through its correlations with psychological variables hypothesized to be related to self-compassion, such as mindfulness, acceptance of cancer, and other coping strategies. Furthermore, measurement invariance testing of the BSCI indicated that it could be used across patients of varying genders, cancer types, and stages of illness. In conclusion, the 5-item BSCI was determined to be psychometrically sound and suitable for use with adults of varying genders, cancer types, and stages of disease.

Molecularly unselected patients (≥18 years) with advanced solid tumors resistant to standard therapy received talazoparib (oral, 1 mg once daily). Primary endpoint was characterization of single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints evaluated safety, unconfirmed objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response. The safety population comprised 15 Chinese patients (median [range] age 53.0 [31.0-72.0] years). Single-dose median time to first occurrence of maximum observed concentration was 1.9 h; concentrations then declined with a mean terminal half-life (t1/2) of 67 h.

The emergence of resistance to androgen deprivation therapy gives rise to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Eprinomectin (EP) is a member of a family of drugs called avermectins with parasiticide and anticancer properties. The pupose of this study was to evaluate the anticancer effects of EP against metastatic PCa using cellular models. METHODS: In this study, we have investigated the effect of EP's anticancer properties and delineated the underlying mechanisms in the DU145 cellular model using several assays such as cell viability assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing assay, immunofluorescence, apoptosis assay, cell cycle analysis, and immunoblotting.  Results:   Our results indicate that EP significantly inhibits the cell viability, colony formation, and migration capacities of DU145 cells. EP induces cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, apoptosis via the activation of different caspases, and autophagy through the increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, EP downregulates the expression of cancer stem cell markers and mediates the translocation of β-catenin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, indicating its role in inhibiting downstream target genes such as c-Myc and cyclin D1.

Naturally occurring variation in genes encoding glucose-lowering drug targets can be used to investigate the effect of their pharmacological perturbation on cancer risk.  Methods:   We developed genetic instruments for three glucose-lowering drug targets (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ [PPARG]; sulfonylurea receptor 1 [ATP binding cassette subfamily C member 8 (ABCC8)]; glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor [GLP1R]) using summary genetic association data from a genome-wide association study of type 2 diabetes in 148,726 cases and 965,732 controls in the Million Veteran Program. Genetic instruments were constructed using cis-acting genome-wide significant (p<5×10-8) SNPs permitted to be in weak linkage disequilibrium (r2<0.20). Summary genetic association estimates for these SNPs were obtained from genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia for the following cancers: breast (122,977 cases, 105,974 controls); colorectal (58,221 cases, 67,694 controls); prostate (79,148 cases, 61,106 controls); and overall (i.e. site-combined) cancer (27,483 cases, 372,016 controls). Inverse-variance weighted random-effects models adjusting for linkage disequilibrium were employed to estimate causal associations between genetically proxied drug target perturbation and cancer risk. Co-localisation analysis was employed to examine robustness of findings to violations of Mendelian randomisation (MR) assumptions. A Bonferroni correction was employed as a heuristic to define associations from MR analyses as 'strong' and 'weak' evidence.  Results:   In MR analysis, genetically proxied PPARG perturbation was weakly associated with higher risk of prostate cancer (for PPARG perturbation equivalent to a 1 unit decrease in inverse rank normal transformed HbA1c: OR 1.75 [95% CI 1.07, 2.85], p=0.02). In histological subtype-stratified analyses, genetically proxied PPARG perturbation was weakly associated with lower risk of oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.38, 0.85], p=6.45×10-3). In co-localisation analysis, however, there was little evidence of shared causal variants for type 2 diabetes liability and cancer endpoints in the PPARG locus, although these analyses were likely underpowered. There was little evidence to support associations between genetically proxied PPARG perturbation and colorectal or overall cancer risk or between genetically proxied ABCC8 or GLP1R perturbation with risk across cancer endpoints.  Conclusions/interpretation:   Our drug target MR analyses did not find consistent evidence to support an association of genetically proxied PPARG, ABCC8 or GLP1R perturbation with breast, colorectal, prostate or overall cancer risk. Further evaluation of these drug targets using alternative molecular epidemiological approaches may help to further corroborate the findings presented in this analysis.

Materials and Methods In this Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant single-center study, the authors retrospectively analyzed radiology reports from 3960 mpMRI examinations (2495 after exclusions) performed between September 2013 and September 2019 and performed outcome comparisons and semiquantitative image assessment of axial T2-weighted images from 120 consecutive mpMRI examinations performed between May 2015 and February 2016. Three experienced radiologists blinded to administration of IM glucagon assessed images using a five-point Likert scale (5 = no motion or blur) for overall image quality, anatomic delineation (prostate capsule, rectum, and lymph nodes), and identification of benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules. Wilcoxon rank sum and χ2 tests were used to assess quantitative parameters. Results The number of mpMRI radiology reports (599 examinations performed with glucagon; 1896, without glucagon) mentioning blur or motion were similar between groups (P = .82). Regression analysis of semiquantitative image quality assessments of T2-weighted images from mpMRI examinations (60 performed with glucagon; 60, without glucagon) demonstrated that images with glucagon were more likely to receive higher scores (4 or 5 rating) than those without glucagon only when the rectum (P = .001) and lymph nodes (P = .01) were evaluated, not when the prostatic capsule, benign prostatic hyperplasia nodules, or overall image quality was evaluated. No evidence of differences was found in identified Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) lesions or targeted-biopsy Gleason scores. Conclusion Administration of IM glucagon did not improve T2-weighted image quality in prostate MRI examinations and showed similar PI-RADS scores and biopsy yields compared with examinations without glucagon.

Despite different treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormone therapy and immunotherapy for this disease, patients ultimately progress to advanced states. Thus, there is a need for new treatment options targeting cell growth and apoptosis to better control the proliferation and metastasis of these cells.  Introduction:   There are many reports indicating overexpression of the 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) enzyme in prostate tumors. Studies have also shown that inhibition of this enzyme prevents the progression of prostate cancer.  Methods:   In this study, the activity of 15-LOX-1 was evaluated in PC-3 cells by a spectrophotometric assay. In addition, due to high similarity between the 15-LOX-1 and soybean 15-lipoxygenase (SLO) (L1; EC 1, 13, 11, 12) active sites, the soybean SLO was used to investigate inhibitory effects of synthetic coumarin compounds 8-isopentenyloxycoumarin (8-IC), 8-isopentenyloxy-3-carboxycoumarin (8-ICC), 8-geranyloxycoumarin (8-GC), 8-geranyloxy-3-carboxycoumarin (8-GCC), and 8-farnesyloxy-3-carboxycoumarin (8-FCC) on this enzyme. Moreover, the cytotoxic and anticancer effects of the coumarin compounds were examined on PC-3 (Prostate Cancer) and HDF-1 (Human Dermal Fibroblast) cells by alamarBlue assay. Finally, apoptosis-inducing effects of all synthetic compounds were determined by flow cytometry.  Results:   The IC50 values obtained by the alamarBlue test revealed that 8-IC, 8-GC and 8-GCC had cytotoxic effects on PC-3 cells. Treating both PC-3 and HDF-1 cells with 8-ICC and 8-FCC did not significantly reduce cell number. Furthermore, the IC50 values of 8-IC on HDF-1 cells showed cytotoxic effects, while treating these cells with 8-GC and 8-GCC did not show any significant cytotoxicity on these normal human fibroblasts. Assessing the ability of 4-MMPB (as a specific inhibitor of 15-LOX-1), 8-GC, and 8-GCC compounds to inhibit SLO revealed that these compounds exerted strong 15-LOX-1 inhibitory activity, while 8-IC and 8-FCC had a weak inhibitory effect and also 8-ICC showed no inhibitory effect on SLO enzyme. In addition, flow cytometric analysis by FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)-annexin V and propidium iodide showed that treatment with IC50 values of 8-GC and 8-GCC induced apoptosis in 35.2% and 30.8% of PC-3 cells, respectively.  Conclusion:   Thus, 8-GC and 8-GCC can be introduced as effective anticancer agents with apoptosis-inducing properties. Furthermore, our results suggest that the cytotoxic effects of these compounds might be related to the inhibition of 15-LOX-1 enzyme in PC-3 cells. On the other hand, the cytotoxic effects of 8-IC might be due to the inhibition of other signaling pathways in PC-3 cells. However, further in vivo experiments are required to determine the exact mechanism involved in the anticancer effects of these coumarin compounds.""","""['Fatemeh Maleki', 'Hamid Sadeghian', 'Ahmad Reza Bahrami', 'Seyed Navid Goftari', 'Maryam M Matin']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""['Stylosin and some of its synthetic derivatives induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells as 15-lipoxygenase enzyme inhibitors.', '8-Farnesyloxycoumarin induces apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells by inhibition of 15-lipoxygenase-1 enzymatic activity.', '7-Farnesyloxycoumarin Exerts Anti-cancer Effects on a Prostate Cancer Cell Line by 15-LOX-1 Inhibition.', 'Investigating the effects of two novel 4-MMPB analogs as potent lipoxygenase inhibitors for prostate cancer treatment.', 'Expression of lipoxygenase in human prostate cancer and growth reduction by its inhibitors.']"""

Two MET chlorination byproducts, including Y and C, were transformed into drinking water during chlorination. However, the potential toxicity of the byproducts in hepatotoxicity and reproduction toxicity remains unclear.  Methods:   The TOPKAT database predicted the toxicological properties of metformin disinfection by-products. The targets of metformin disinfection by-products were mainly obtained from the PharmMapper database, and then the targets of hepatotoxicity and reproductive toxicity were screened from GeneCards. The overlapping targets of toxic component targets and the hepatotoxicity or reproduction toxicity targets were regarded as the key targets. Then, the STRING database analyzed the key target to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI) and GO, and KEGG analysis was performed by the DAVID platform. Meanwhile, the PPI network and compound-target network were constructed by Cytoscape 3.9.1. Finally, Discovery Studio 2019 software was used for molecular docking verification of the two toxic compounds and the core genes.  Results:   Y and C exhibited hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and mutagenicity evaluated by TOPKAT. There were 22 potential targets relating to compound Y and hepatotoxicity and reproduction toxicity and 14 potential targets relating to compound C and hepatotoxicity and reproduction toxicity. PPI network analysis showed that SRC, MAPK14, F2, PTPN1, IL2, MMP3, HRAS, and RARA might be the key targets; the KEGG analysis indicated that compounds Y and C caused hepatotoxicity through Hepatitis B, Pathways in cancer, Chemical carcinogenesis-reactive oxygen species, Epstein-Barr virus infection; compound Y and C caused reproduction toxicity through GnRH signaling pathway, Endocrine resistance, Prostate cancer, Progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation. Molecular docking results showed that 2 compounds could fit in the binding pocket of the 7 hub genes.

The objective of the study was to investigate long-term effects of salvage radiotherapy.  Methods:   A prospective, controlled, non-randomized trial at 14 Swedish center's including 4,003 patients scheduled for radical prostatectomy 2008-2011. A target trial emulation approach was used to identify eligible patients that was treated with salvage radiotherapy. The control group received no salvage radiotherapy. Outcomes were assessed by patient questionnaires on ordinal scales and statistical group comparisons were made using ordered logit regression with adjustment for baseline outcome and confounding factors. The primary endpoints were bowel, urinary and sexual function and bothering due to dysfunction at 8 years.  Results:   Eleven percent (330/3,139) of the analyzed study population received salvage radiotherapy. Fecal leakage, leakage of mucus and hematochezia were more common after receiving salvage radiotherapy compared with the control group; 4.5% versus 2.6% odds ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): (1.90 [1.38; 2.62]), 6.8% versus 1.5% 4.14 (2.98; 5.76) and 8.6% versus 1.2% 4.14 (2.98; 5.76), respectively.

Therapy resistance and significant side effects of current treatment strategies indicate the need for more effective agents to treat both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa. In earlier studies, we demonstrated that depletion of L-cysteine/cystine with an engineered human enzyme, Cyst(e)inase, increased intracellular ROS levels and inhibited PCa growth in vitro and in vivo. The current study was conducted to further explore the mechanisms and potential combinatorial approaches with Cyst(e)inase for treatment of PCa.  Methods:   DNA single strand breaks and clustered oxidative DNA damage were evaluated by alkaline comet assay and pulsed field gel electrophoresis, respectively. Neutral comet assay and immunofluorescence staining was used to measure DNA double strand breaks. Cell survival and reactive oxygen species level were measured by crystal violet assay and DCFDA staining, respectively. Western blot was used to determine protein expression. FACS analyses were preformed for immune cell phenotyping. Allograft and xenograft tumor models were used for assessing effects on tumor growth.  Results:   PCa cells treated with Cyst(e)inase lead to DNA single and double strand breaks resulted from clustered oxidative DNA damage (SSBs and DSBs). Cyst(e)inase in combination with Auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, further increased intracellular ROS and DNA DSBs and synergistically inhibited PCa cell growth in vitro and in vivo. A combination of Cyst(e)inase with a PARP inhibitor (Olaparib) also increased DNA DSBs and synergistically inhibited PCa cell growth in vitro and in vivo without additional ROS induction. Knockdown of BRCA2 in PCa cells increased DSBs and enhanced sensitivity to Cyst(e)inase. Finally, Cyst(e)inase treatment altered tumor immune infiltrates and PD-L1 expression and sensitized PCa cells to anti-PD-L1 treatment.  Conclusions:   The current results demonstrate the importance of oxidative DNA damage either alone or in combination for Cyst(e)inase-induced anticancer activity. Furthermore, cysteine/cystine depletion alters the tumor immune landscape favoring enhanced immune checkpoint inhibition targeting PD-L1. Thus, combinatorial approaches with Cyst(e)inase could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for PCa.""","""['Achinto Saha#', 'Shengyuan Zhao#', 'Austin Kindall', 'Carly Wilder', 'Chelsea A Friedman', 'Rachel Clark', 'George Georgiou', 'Everett Stone', 'Dawit Kidane', 'John DiGiovanni']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""['Combinatorial Approaches to Enhance DNA Damage following Enzyme-Mediated Depletion of L-Cys for Treatment of Pancreatic Cancer.', 'Systemic depletion of L-cyst(e)ine with cyst(e)inase increases reactive oxygen species and suppresses tumor growth.', 'Enzyme-mediated depletion of l-cyst(e)ine synergizes with thioredoxin reductase inhibition for suppression of pancreatic tumor growth.', 'DNA-Damage-Repair Gene Alterations in Genitourinary Malignancies.', 'Emerging strategies: PARP inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint blockade in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation-associated and triple-negative breast cancer.']"""

However, the relationship between FFA C8:0 and PCa has not been reported. In this study, we explored whether the FFA C8:0 can promotes the progression of PCa by up-regulating Krüppel-like factor 7 (KLF7).  Methods:   We collected tissues from PCa patients and Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), constructed a primary-tumor bearing mouse model with obesity through high-fat diet, and observed the tumor formation ability of PCa cells. In vitro, CCK8 assay, plate cloning, Transwell and scratch experiment were used to detect the changes in biological behavior of PCa cells stimulated by FFA C8:0.  Results:   First, we found that the expression level of KLF7 is higher in PCa tissues of patients, and the expression of KLF7 is positively correlated with tumour-promoting gene IL-6, while it is negative correlated with another tumour-suppressor gene p21. Then, this study found that PCa cells were more likely to form tumors in diet induced obese mice. Compared with the normal diet group (ND), the expression levels of KLF7 in tumor tissues in high-fat diet group (HFD) were higher. Futhermore, we verified that high concentrations of FFA C8:0 can promote the biological behavior of PCa cells by activating KLF7/IL-6/p21 signaling pathway, which is mediated by the GPR84.

Controls were matched to cases by cohort, age, sex, race, and date at blood draw. We used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) per one-standard deviation increase in log-lipid concentrations within each cohort, and combined ORs using fixed-effects meta-analyses. Forty-three lipid species were associated with PDAC (false discovery rate, FDR ≤ 0.10), including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC, n = 2), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE, n = 17), triacylglycerols (n = 13), phosphatidylcholines (PC, n = 3), diacylglycerols (n = 4), monoacylglycerols (MAG, n = 2), cholesteryl esters (CE, n = 1), and sphingomyelins (n = 1). LPC(18:2) and PE(O-16:0/18:2) showed significant inverse associations with PDAC at the Bonferroni threshold (P value < 5.5 × 10-5).

It is critical to develop a rapid and convenient method to accurately detect PSA levels, especially when the PSA levels are in the clinical gray area of 4-10 ng/mL. We developed a novel upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)-based fluorescence lateral flow test strip for qualitatively and quantitatively detecting PSA. The carboxyl group-modified UCNPs (UCNP-COOH) were labeled with anti-PSA antibodies via 1-ethyl-3-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) as labeling probes to recognize PSA. The fluorescence intensity of the UCNP-probe was then measured with a laser fluorescence scanner. A total of 1397 serum and 20 fingertip blood samples were collected to validate the UCNP strip. A reliable correlation between the area ratio (TC), reflecting the fluorescence intensity of the test/control line, and the PSA concentration was observed (r = 0.9986). The dose-dependent luminescence enhancement showed good linearity in the PSA concentration range from 0.1 to 100.0 ng/mL with a detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL. Our UCNP POCT strip demonstrated excellent accuracy, anti-interference and stability in the gray zone (4-10 ng/mL) of PSA clinical application and outperformed other PSA test strips. The UCNP strip showed good consistency with the Roche chemiluminescence assay in 1397 serum samples. It also showed good performance for PSA detection using fingertip blood samples.

Our group has described the role of sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2) overexpression in ARSI-resistant PC. Continuing this work, we report that NR3C1, the gene encoding glucocorticoid receptor (GR), is a novel SOX2 target in PC, positively regulating its expression. Similar to ARSI treatment, SOX2-positive PC cells are insensitive to GR signaling inhibition using a GR modulating therapy. To understand SOX2-mediated nuclear hormone receptor signaling inhibitor (NHRSI) insensitivity, we performed RNA-seq in SOX2-positive and -negative PC cells following NHRSI treatment. RNA-seq prioritized differentially regulated genes mediating the cell cycle, including G2 checkpoint WEE1 Kinase (WEE1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1).

However, the short half-life in blood and the biopharmaceutical problem of LEU limit this anticancer activity.  Purpose:   To improve its druggability for improving anticancer activity, the amine-group targeted LEU was conjugated with different chain lengths of saturated fatty acids (FAs).  Methods:   LEU-fatty acid conjugates (LFCs) were synthesized by exploiting N-hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS) conjugation chemistry. The physicochemical properties and the self-assembled behaviors of the conjugates were extensively investigated. The in vitro anticancer activity of three LFCs was extensively studied in both 2D monolayer and 3D spheroid culture models of a prostate cancer cell line, PC3.  Results:   Three LFCs could be readily self-assembled into nanoparticles (LFNs) with a small size of around 100 nm, positive charges, and exhibited greater permeability rates compared to the same concentration of LEU, excluding LSN. The chain length of FA in conjugate was positively related to the selectivity index between cancer cells and non-cancerous cell lines. All LFCs showed a superior direct antiproliferative effect on cancer cells in the following order: LSC (98.9%) > LPC (86.7%) > LLC (75.0%) > LEU (8.9%) after repeat daily of the same dose strength of LEU for 4 days. In addition, the 3D spheroid model study indicates that all LFCs with a one-time treatment performed a long-acting inhibitory effect on tumor growth as compared to LEU after 7 days.  Conclusion:   The conjugation of LEU with different chain lengths of FAs could provide a novel strategy to improve peptide stability and exert an additional superior direct inhibitory effect for the treatment of several hormone-responsive tumor systems using therapeutic peptides.""","""['Hai V Ngo', 'Hye-Eun Bak', 'Hy D Nguyen', 'Kye Wan Lee', 'Chulhun Park', 'Beom-Jin Lee']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Nanomedicine""","""['Hydroxyl Group-Targeted Conjugate and Its Self-Assembled Nanoparticle of Peptide Drug: Effect of Degree of Saturation of Fatty Acids and Modification of Physicochemical Properties.', 'Determination of Leuprolide-Fatty Acid Conjugate in Rat Plasma Using LC-MS/MS and Its Pharmacokinetics after Subcutaneous Administration in Rats.', 'Importance of the fatty acid chain length on in vitro and in vivo anticancer activity of fattigation-platform albumin nanoparticles in human colorectal cancer xenograft mice model.', 'Peptides and antitumor activity.

Methods:   Eighteen in-training-radiologists of varying experience in reviewing diagnostic prostate MRI assessed the image quality of ten examinations. Then, they attended a dedicated lecture on MRI quality assessment using the PI-QUAL score. After the lecture, the same participants evaluated the image quality of a new set of ten scans applying the PI-QUAL score. Results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The reference standard was the PI-QUAL score assessed by a fellowship trained abdominal radiologist with experience in reading prostate MRI.  Results:   There was a significant improvement in the average area under the curve (AUC) for assessment of prostate MRI image quality from baseline (0.82; [0.576 - 0.888]) to post teaching (1.0; [0.954-1]), with an improvement of 0.18 (p < 0.03). When ROC curves were computed for different cohorts stratified based on year of training, difference ranged from 0.48 for second year residents to 0.32 for fourth year residents (p < 0.001-0.01). For abdominal imaging fellows, the pre-teaching AUC was 0.9 [0.557-1] and post teaching AUC was 1 [0.957-1], a difference of 0.1 (p = 0.20).

Methods:   Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), EdU incorporation assay, trypan blue dye assay and colony formation assay were employed to evaluate the effect of TFLS on PCa in vitro. The xenograft mouse model was established to explore the anti-tumour effect of TFLS in vivo. Alterations in the metabolic profiles of the PC3 cells and mouse serum were obtained by untargeted metabolomics. Combination with metabolomics analysis and network pharmacology strategies, the potential targets were predicted and further validated by RT-qPCR.  Key findings:   TFLS attenuated PCa progression both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomics results yielded from cells and serum indicated that the anti-cancer effect of TFLS was correlated with synergistic modulation of five common metabolic pathways including glycerophospholipid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism and steroid biosynthesis. Using in silico prediction and RT-qPCR analysis, we further revealed that TFLS exerted anti-PCa activities via regulating the expressions of nine genes, including MAOA, ACHE, ALDH2, AMD1, ARG1, PLA2G10, PLA2G1B, FDFT1 and SQLE.

Additionally, the effects of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on the physical function and hQoL in these patients were compared with those of moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT).  Methods:   Seventeen prostate cancer patients who underwent ADT were prospectively allocated to either HIIT (n = 9) or MICT (n = 8). In these patients, physical function and hQoL were measured before and after 12 weeks of exercise and 3-6 months after the exercise program, respectively.  Results:   Although the whole-body total mass significantly increased after the exercise program, it was equivalent regardless of the exercise methods. After the exercise program, muscle strength and endurance improved and tended to be maintained until 3-6 months later. Improvement in muscle endurance was more prominent after HIIT, and that in muscle strength was more prominent after MICT. Performance in the senior fitness test improved after the exercise program, and HIIT was more effective for lower and upper muscle endurance and flexibility, although MICT was more effective for the others. The hQoL significantly improved 3-6 months after the exercise program.  Conclusion:   The 12-week exercise program has a positive effect on the physical function and hQoL in prostate cancer patients who underwent ADT. In these patients, compared with MICT, HIIT may be a better option for improving muscle endurance, which is thought to be significant for preventing falls and fractures in elderly patients.""","""['Sangjun Yoo', 'Kyung Hee Lee', 'Parivash Jamrasi', 'Min Chul Cho', 'Wook Song', 'Hyeon Jeong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Int""","""['A Comparative Study of Health Efficacy Indicators in Subjects with T2DM Applying Power Cycling to 12 Weeks of Low-Volume High-Intensity Interval Training and Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training.', 'Mediterranean Style Dietary Pattern with High Intensity Interval Training in Men with Prostate Cancer Treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Pilot Randomised Control Trial.', 'Effectiveness of High-Intensity Interval Training vs Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training in Patients With Fibromyalgia: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.', 'High intensity interval training versus moderate intensity continuous training on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.', 'A systematic review and meta-analysis of interval training versus moderate-intensity continuous training on body adiposity.']"""

Methods:   We performed retrospective analyses of 70 patients with high-risk, nonmetastatic PCa confirmed by biopsy between 2018 and 2021. All patients underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by RP and pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND); PSMA-PET/CT was performed before initiation of neoadjuvant therapy.

Results:   Among 70 high-risk PCa patients, median age was 69 years old and median prostate specific antigen (PSA) at presentation was 58.5 ng/mL. Thirty (42.9%) patients had uptake of the PSMA tracer only in the primary PCa lesions and 40 (57.1%) patients had PSMA-positive lesions in regional or distant sites. Sixteen (32%) localized PCa patients defined by pre-PET magnetic resonance imaging were found to have locally advanced PCa based on PSMA-PET/CT. Fifteen (30%) localized PCa patients and 7 (35%) locally advanced PCa patients were upstaged to metastatic PCa. The sensitivity and specificity of PSMA-PET/CT for the detection of lymph node involvement were 90.9% and 69.5%, respectively, with a positive prediction value of 35.7% and negative prediction value of 97.6%. The diagnostic accuracy was 72.9%. Univariate analysis showed upstaging, tumor stage, and metastasis location based on PSMA-PET/CT are predictors to PSA persistence after surgery, while multivariate logistic regression analysis showed only the tumor stage based on PSMA-PET/CT remained an independent predictor of the outcome.

Castrated (Cx) rats received pellets of either 17β estradiol (E2) or E2 and T and were treated with I2 (0.05%) in the drinking water for four weeks. The experimental groups were sham, Cx, Cx + E2, Cx + E2+I2, Cx + E2+T, and Cx + E2+T + I2. As expected, inflammation was triggered in the Cx + E2 group (high inflammation score; increase in TNF and transcriptional activity of RELA [nuclear factor-kappa B p65 subunit]), and this effect was diminished in the Cx + E2+T group (medium inflammation score and decrease in TNF). The lowest inflammation score (decrease of TNF and RELA and increase of PPARG) was obtained in the Cx + E2+T + I2 group. In DU145 cells, I2 (400 μM) and TNF (10 ng/ml) additively reduced cell viability, and I2 reduced the production of TNF-stimulated IL6. The PPARG antagonist (GW9662) did not inhibit the effects of I2 on the loss of cell viability. In summary, our data suggest that I2 and T exert a synergistic anti-inflammatory action on the normal prostate, and the interrelationship between I2 and TNF leads to anti-proliferative effects in DU145 cells.

Then, the MIPs were produced on the modified C-SPE by electropolymerization of a mixture of STEAP1 and a monomer (pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid). Then, the protein was removed from the polymeric network by enzymatic treatment with trypsin, which created the specific template cavities for further STEAP1 detection. Electrochemical techniques such as EIS and CV were used to follow the chemical modification steps of C-SPE. The analytical performance of the biosensor was evaluated by SWV in PBS buffer and in lysates of neoplastic prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) extracts.

Objective:   to evaluate the risk of CVD-related death in older patients with cancer.  Methods:   older patients with cancer (over 65 years) of 16 cancers diagnosed between 1975 and 2018 were screened out from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program. The proportion of deaths, competing risk regression models, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were used to assess the risk of CVD-related death.  Results:   this study included 1,141,675 older patients (median follow-up: 13.5 years). Of the 16 individual cancers, the risk of CVD death exceeded primary neoplasm death in older patients with cancers of the breast, endometrium, vulva, prostate gland, penis and melanoma of the skin over time (high competing risk group). Compared to the general older population, older patients with cancer had higher SMR and AER of CVD-related death (SMR: 1.58-4.23; AER: 21.16-365.89), heart disease-related death (SMR: 1.14-4.16; AER: 16.29-301.68) and cerebrovascular disease-related death (SMR: 1.11-4.66; AER: 3.02-72.43), with the SMR trend varying with CVD-related death competing risk classifications. The risk of CVD-related death in the high-competing risk group was higher than in the low-competing risk group.  Conclusions:   for older patients with cancer, six of 16 individual cancers, including breast, endometrium, vulva, prostate gland, penis and melanoma of the skin was at high risk of CVD-related death.

Although 5-ARI has been widely associated with prostate cancer, its association with urothelial bladder cancer (BC), another cancer experienced predominantly by males, has been less explored.  Objective:   To assess the association between 5-ARI prescription prior to BC diagnosis and reduced risk of BC progression.  Design, setting, and participants:   This cohort study analyzed patient claims data from the Korean National Health Insurance Service database. The nationwide cohort included all male patients with BC diagnosis in this database from January 1, 2008, to December 31, 2019. Propensity score matching was conducted to balance the covariates between 2 treatment groups: α-blocker only group and 5-ARI plus α-blocker group. Data were analyzed from April 2021 to March 2023.  Exposure:   Newly dispensed prescriptions of 5-ARIs at least 12 months prior to cohort entry (BC diagnosis), with a minimum of 2 prescriptions filled.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcomes were the risks of bladder instillation and radical cystectomy, and the secondary outcome was all-cause mortality. To compare the risk of outcomes, the hazard ratio (HR) was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model and difference in restricted mean survival time analysis.  Results:   The study cohort initially included 22 845 males with BC. After propensity score matching, 5300 patients each were assigned to the α-blocker only group (mean [SD] age, 68.3 [8.8] years) and 5-ARI plus α-blocker group (mean [SD] age, 67.8 [8.6] years). Compared with the α-blocker only group, the 5-ARI plus α-blocker group had a lower risk of mortality (adjusted HR [AHR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91), bladder instillation (crude HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92), and radical cystectomy (AHR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88).

Materials and methods:   An animal prostate tumor model was developed by implanting human LNCaP tumor cells in the prostates of nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with pFUS, RT or both (pFUS + RT) and compared with a control group. Non-thermal pFUS treatment was delivered by keeping the body temperature below 42 °C as measured real-time by MR thermometry and using a pFUS protocol (1 MHz, 25 W focused ultrasound; 1 Hz pulse rate with a 10% duty cycle for 60 sec for each sonication). Each tumor was covered entirely using 4-8 sonication spots. RT treatment with a dose of 2 Gy was delivered using an external beam (6 MV photon energy with dose rate 300MU/min). Following the treatment, mice were scanned weekly with MRI for tumor volume measurement.  Results:   The results showed that the tumor volume in the control group increased exponentially to 142 ± 6%, 205 ± 12%, 286 ± 22% and 410 ± 33% at 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after treatment, respectively. In contrast, the pFUS group was 29% (p < 0.05), 24% (p < 0.05), 8% and 9% smaller, the RT group was 7%, 10%, 12% and 18% smaller, and the pFUS + RT group was 32%, 39%, 41% and 44% (all with p < 0.05) smaller than the control group at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post treatment, respectively. Tumors treated by pFUS showed an early response (i.e. the first 2 weeks), while the RT group showed a late response. The combined pFUS + RT treatment showed consistent response throughout the post-treatment weeks.  Conclusions:   These results suggest that RT combined with non-thermal pFUS can significantly delay the tumor growth. The mechanism of tumor cell killing between pFUS and RT may be different. Pulsed FUS shows early tumor growth delay, while RT contributes to the late effect on tumor growth delay.

For example, drugs have been conjugated into tumor-targeting antibodies to enable delivery directly to tumor cells. Aptamers are an attractive class of molecules for this type of drug targeting as they are high-affinity/high-specificity ligands, relatively small in size, GMP manufacturable at a large-scale, amenable to chemical conjugation, and not immunogenic. Previous work from our group revealed that an aptamer selected to internalize into human prostate cancer cells, called E3, can also target a broad range of human cancers but not normal control cells. Moreover, this E3 aptamer can deliver highly cytotoxic drugs to cancer cells as Aptamer-highly Toxic Drug Conjugates (ApTDCs) and inhibit tumor growth in vivo. Here, we evaluate its targeting mechanism and report that E3 selectively internalizes into cancer cells utilizing a pathway that involves transferrin receptor 1 (TfR 1). E3 binds to recombinant human TfR 1 with high affinity and competes with transferrin (Tf) for binding to TfR1. In addition, knockdown or knockin of human TfR1 results in a decrease or increase in E3 cell binding. Here, we reported a molecular model of E3 binding to the transferrin receptor that summarizes our findings.""","""['Xirui Song', 'Haixiang Yu', 'Cynthia Sullenger', 'Bethany Powell Gray', 'Amy Yan', 'Linsley Kelly', 'Bruce Sullenger']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""['An Aptamer for Broad Cancer Targeting and Therapy.', 'Tunable cytotoxic aptamer-drug conjugates for the treatment of prostate cancer.', 'A DNA Aptameric Ligand of Human Transferrin Receptor Generated by Cell-SELEX.', 'Antibodies Targeting the Transferrin Receptor 1 (TfR1) as Direct Anti-cancer Agents.', 'Structure and dynamics of drug carriers and their interaction with cellular receptors: focus on serum transferrin.']"""

The caspase-cleaved fragment of Par-4 (cl-Par-4) is active and plays a role in tumor suppression by inhibiting cell survival pathways. Here, we employed site-directed mutagenesis to create a cl-Par-4 point mutant (D313K). The expressed and purified D313K protein was characterized using biophysical techniques, and the results were compared to that of the wild-type (WT). We have previously demonstrated that WT cl-Par-4 attains a stable, compact, and helical conformation in the presence of a high level of salt at physiological pH. Here, we show that the D313K protein attains a similar conformation as the WT in the presence of salt, but at an approximately two times lower salt concentration. This establishes that the substitution of a basic residue for an acidic residue at position 313 alleviates inter-helical charge repulsion between dimer partners and helps to stabilize the structural conformation.""","""['Samjhana Pandey', 'Krishna K Raut', 'Andrea M Clark', 'Antoine Baudin', 'Lamya Djemri', 'David S Libich', 'Komala Ponniah', 'Steven M Pascal']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomolecules""","""['Structural Analysis of the cl-Par-4 Tumor Suppressor as a Function of Ionic Environment.', 'pH-Induced Folding of the Caspase-Cleaved Par-4 Tumor Suppressor: Evidence of Structure Outside of the Coiled Coil Domain.', 'Tetramer formation by the caspase-activated fragment of the Par-4 tumor suppressor.', 'Characterization of intrinsically disordered proteins and their dynamic complexes: From in vitro to cell-like environments.', 'NMR contributions to structural dynamics studies of intrinsically disordered proteins.']"""

This work extends a recently developed supervised machine learning (ML) technique, called coherent voting networks (CVN) by incorporating a novel model-selection technique to counter the danger of model overfitting. For the challenging problem of discriminating between indolent and aggressive types of localized prostate cancer, accurate prognostic prediction of post-surgery progression-free survival with a granularity within a year is attained, improving accuracy with respect to the current state of the art. The development of novel ML techniques tailored to the problem of combining multi-omics and clinical prognostic biomarkers is a promising new line of attack for sharpening the capability to diversify and personalize cancer patient treatments.

Methods:   In 2005-2012, we recruited 1931 incident prostate cancer cases and 1994 controls in a case-control study in Montreal, Canada. Lifetime residential addresses were linked to an area-based social deprivation index around recruitment (2006) and about 10 years earlier (1996).

The increase in risk with recent high social deprivation was particularly elevated for high-grade prostate cancer at diagnosis (OR 1.87, 95% CI 1.32-2.64).

Dysregulation of DNMTs is linked to various diseases and carcinogenesis, and therefore except for the two approved anticancer azanucleoside drugs, various non-nucleoside DNMT inhibitors have been identified and reported. However, the underlying mechanisms for the inhibitory activity of these non-nucleoside inhibitors still remain largely unknown. Here, we systematically tested and compared the inhibition activities of five non-nucleoside inhibitors toward the three human DNMTs. We found that harmine and nanaomycin A blocked the methyltransferase activity of DNMT3A and DNMT3B more efficiently than resveratrol, EGCG, and RG108. We further determined the crystal structure of harmine in complex with the catalytic domain of the DNMT3B-DNMT3L tetramer revealing that harmine binds at the adenine cavity of the SAM-binding pocket in DNMT3B. Our kinetics assays confirm that harmine competes with SAM to competitively inhibit DNMT3B-3L activity with a Ki of 6.6 μM. Cell-based studies further show that harmine treatment inhibits castration-resistant prostate cancer cell (CRPC) proliferation with an IC50 of ∼14 μM.

Objective:   To evaluate patient preferences regarding the attributed benefits and harms of systemic treatments for mHSPC and preference heterogeneity between individuals and specific subgroups.  Design setting and participants:   We conducted an online discrete choice experiment (DCE) preference survey among 77 patients with metastatic prostate cancer (mPC) and 311 men from the general population in Switzerland between November 2021 and August 2022.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   We evaluated preferences and preference heterogeneity related to survival benefits and treatment-related adverse effects using mixed multinomial logit models and estimated the maximum survival time participants were willing to trade to avert specific adverse effects. We further assessed characteristics associated with different preference patterns via subgroup and latent class analyses.  Results and limitations:   Patients with mPC showed an overall stronger preference for survival benefits in comparison to men from the general population (p = 0.004), with substantial preference heterogeneity between individuals within the two samples (both p < 0.001). There was no evidence of differences in preferences for men aged 45-65 yr versus ≥65 yr, patients with mPC in different disease stages or with different adverse effect experiences, or general population participants with and without experiences with cancer. Latent class analyses suggested the presence of two groups strongly preferring either survival or the absence of adverse effects, with no specific characteristic clearly associated with belonging to either group. Potential biases due to participant selection, cognitive burden, and hypothetical choice scenarios may limit the study results.  Conclusions:   Given the relevant heterogeneity in participant preferences regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for mHSPC, patient preferences should be explicitly discussed during decision-making in clinical practice and reflected in clinical practice guidelines and regulatory assessment regarding treatment for mHSPC.  Patient summary:   We examined the preferences (values and perceptions) of patients and men from the general population regarding the benefits and harms of treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. There were large differences between men in how they balanced the expected survival benefits and potential adverse effects. While some men strongly valued survival, others more strongly valued the absence of adverse effects. Therefore, it is important to discuss patient preferences in clinical practice.""","""['Dominik Menges', 'Michela C Piatti', 'Aurelius Omlin', 'Richard Cathomas', 'Daniel Benamran', 'Stefanie Fischer', 'Christophe Iselin', 'Marc Küng', 'Anja Lorch', 'Lukas Prause', 'Christian Rothermundt', ""Alix O'Meara Stern"", 'Deborah Zihler', 'Max Lippuner', 'Julia Braun', 'Thomas Cerny', 'Milo A Puhan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Urol Open Sci""","""[""A Systematic Review of Patients' Values, Preferences, and Expectations for the Treatment of Metastatic Prostate Cancer."", 'Patient Preferences for Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treatments: A Discrete Choice Experiment Among Men in Three European Countries.', ""Men's preferences and trade-offs for prostate cancer screening: a discrete choice experiment."", 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Management of Metastatic Hormone-Sensitive Prostate Cancer (mHSPC): an Evolving Treatment Paradigm.']"""

Objectives:   This study aimed to define the influence of androgens and diet (tomato and lycopene) on prostatic miRNA expression during early carcinogenesis in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model.  Methods:   Wild type (WT) and TRAMP mice were fed control, tomato-containing, or lycopene-containing diets from 4 to 10 weeks of age. Mice underwent either sham (intact) or castration surgery at 8 wk, and half of the castrated mice received testosterone (2.5 mg/kg body weight/d) at 9 wk. Mice were killed at 10 wk, and dorsolateral prostate expression of 602 miRNAs was assessed.  Results:   We detected expression of 88 miRNAs (15% of 602), all of which were present in the TRAMP, in comparison with 49 miRNAs being detectable (8%) in WT. Expression of 61 miRNAs differed by TRAMP genotype, with the majority upregulated in TRAMP. Of the 61 miRNAs, 42 were responsive to androgen status. Diet affected 41% of the miRNAs, which differed by genotype (25/61) and 48% of the androgen-sensitive miRNAs (20/42), indicating overlapping genetic and dietary influences on prostate miRNAs. Tomato and lycopene feeding influenced miRNAs previously associated with the regulation of androgen (miR-145 and let-7), MAPK (miR-106a, 204, 145/143, and 200b/c), and p53 signaling (miR-125 and miR-98) pathways.

Different ways of presenting information may influence older adults' screening decision-making; whether the same is true for physicians is unknown.  Objective:   To examine how different ways of presenting patient health information are associated with physician decision-making about cancer screening cessation for older adults.  Design, setting, and participants:   A national survey was mailed from April 29 to November 8, 2021, to a random sample of 1800 primary care physicians and 600 gynecologists from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile. Primary care physicians were surveyed about breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer screenings. Gynecologists were surveyed about breast cancer screening.  Main outcomes and measures:   Using vignettes of 2 older patients with limited life expectancies, 4 pieces of information about each patient were presented: (1) description of health conditions and functional status, (2) life expectancy, (3) equivalent physiological age, and (4) risk of dying from the specific cancer in the patient's remaining lifetime. The primary outcome was which information was perceived to be the most influential in screening cessation.  Results:   The final sample included 776 participants (adjusted response rate, 52.8%; mean age, 51.4 years [range, 27-91 years]; 402 of 775 participants were men [51.9%]; 508 of 746 participants were White [68.1%]). The 2 types of information that were most often chosen as the factors most influential in cancer screening cessation were description of the patient's health or functional status (36.7% of vignettes [569 of 1552]) and risk of death from cancer in the patient's remaining lifetime (34.9% of vignettes [542 of 1552]). Life expectancy was chosen as the most influential factor in 23.1% of vignettes (358 of 1552). Physiological age was the least often chosen (5.3% of vignettes [83 of 1552]) as the most influential factor. Description of patient's health or functional status was the most influential factor among primary care physicians (estimated probability, 40.2%; 95% CI, 36.2%-44.2%), whereas risk of death from cancer was the most influential factor among gynecologists (estimated probability, 43.1%; 95% CI, 34.0%-52.1%). Life expectancy was perceived as a more influential factor in the vignette with more limited life expectancy (estimated probability, 27.9%; 95% CI, 24.5%-31.3%) and for colorectal cancer (estimated probability, 33.9%; 95% CI, 27.3%-40.5%) or prostate cancer (28.0%; 95% CI, 21.7%-34.2%) screening than for breast cancer screening (estimated probability, 14.5%; 95% CI, 10.9%-18.0%).  Conclusions and relevance:   Findings from this national survey study of physicians suggest that, in addition to the patient's health and functional status, the cancer risk in the patient's remaining lifetime and life expectancy were the factors most associated with physician decision-making regarding cancer screening cessation; information on cancer risk in the patient's remaining lifetime and life expectancy is not readily available during clinical encounters.

In prostate cancer (PCa), BAZ2A function goes beyond this role because it represses genes frequently silenced in metastatic disease. However, the mechanisms of this BAZ2A-mediated repression remain elusive. Here, we show that BAZ2A represses genes through its RNA-binding TAM domain using mechanisms differing from rDNA silencing. Although the TAM domain mediates BAZ2A recruitment to rDNA, in PCa, this is not required for BAZ2A association with target genes. Instead, the BAZ2A-TAM domain in association with RNA mediates the interaction with topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) and histone demethylase KDM1A, whose expression positively correlates with BAZ2A levels in localized and metastatic PCa. TOP2A and KDM1A pharmacological inhibition up-regulate BAZ2A-repressed genes that are regulated by inactive enhancers bound by BAZ2A, whereas rRNA genes are not affected. Our findings showed a novel RNA-based mechanism of gene regulation in PCa.

RB1 is a tumor suppressor gene that is lost in a majority of NEPC tumors. In this issue of the JCI, Wang and colleagues examined how RB1 loss may sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis inducers through elevation of ACSL4, a key enzyme that promotes lipid peroxidation and triggers ferroptosis. We discuss a high potential of RB1-deficient cells to undergo ferroptosis due to the elevation of ACSL4. This is normally kept in check by abundant expression of GPX4, an antioxidant enzyme, in cancer cells. This balance, however, is tilted by GPX4 inhibitors, leading to massive ferroptosis.

Using prospective, population-based data, all Hong Kong patients with prostate cancer who received ADT during 1 January 1993 to 3 March 2021 were identified and followed up for the endpoint of cardiovascular hospitalization/mortality until 31 September 2021, whichever earlier. Multivariable competing risk regression was used to compare the endpoint's cumulative incidence between different combinations of major cardiovascular comorbidities (heart failure [HF], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke and/or arrhythmia), with noncardiovascular death as competing event. Altogether, 13 537 patients were included (median age 75.9 [interquartile range 70.0-81.5] years old; median follow-up 3.3 [1.5-6.7] years). Compared to those with none of prior HF/MI/stroke/arrhythmia, the incidence of the endpoint was not different in those with only stroke (subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.06 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92-1.23], P = .391), but was higher in those with only HF (SHR 1.67 [1.37-2.02], P < .001), arrhythmia (SHR 1.63 [1.35-1.98], P < .001) or MI (SHR 1.43 [1.14-1.79], P = .002). Those with ≥2 of HF/MI/stroke/arrhythmia had the highest incidence of the endpoint (SHR 1.94 [1.62-2.33], P < .001), among whom different major cardiovascular comorbidities had similar prognostic impacts, with the number of comorbidities present being significantly prognostic instead. In conclusion, in patients with prostate cancer receiving ADT, the sole presence of HF, MI or arrhythmia, but not stroke, may be associated with elevated cardiovascular risks.

Here we use the most recent PLSD cohort that is larger and has wider geographical representation than previous versions, allowing us to present mortality as an outcome, and median ages at cancer diagnoses for the first time.  Methods:   The PLSD is a prospective observational study without a control group that was designed in 2012 and updated up to October 2022. Data for 8500 carriers of path_MMR variants from 25 countries were included, providing 71,713 years of follow up. Cumulative cancer incidences at 65 years of age were combined with 10-year crude survival following cancer, to derive estimates of mortality up to 75 years of age by organ, gene, and gender.  Findings:   Gynaecological cancers were more frequent than colorectal cancers in path_MSH2, path_MSH6 and path_PMS2 carriers [cumulative incidence: 53.3%, 49.6% and 23.3% at 75 years, respectively]. Endometrial, colon and ovarian cancer had low mortality [8%, 13% and 15%, respectively] and prostate cancers were frequent in male path_MSH2 carriers [cumulative incidence: 39.7% at 75 years]. Pancreatic, brain, biliary tract and ureter and kidney and urinary bladder cancers were associated with high mortality [83%, 66%, 58%, 27%, and 29%, respectively]. Among path_MMR carriers undergoing colonoscopy surveillance, particularly path_MSH2 carriers, more deaths followed non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers than colorectal cancers.  Interpretation:   In path_MMR carriers undergoing colonoscopy surveillance, non-colorectal Lynch syndrome cancers were associated with more deaths than were colorectal cancers.

LINC00106 contributes to the carcinogenesis of Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, it is unclear how it affects PCa advancement. Here, we studied LINC00106's effects on PCa cells' ability to proliferate, invade, and metastasize.  Methods:   The data of LINC00106 from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) in human PCa tissues were analyzed using TANRIC and survival analysis. In order to determine the expression levels of genes and proteins, we also performed reverse transcription-quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. The migration, invasion, colony formation, and proliferation (CCK-8) of PCa cells with LINC00106 knockdown were investigated. The impact of LINC00106 on cell proliferation and invasion was also analyzed in mice. LncRNA prediction software catRAPID omics v2.1 (catRAPID omics v2.0 (tartaglialab.com)) was used to predict proteins that might interact with LINC00106. The interactions were verified via RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA pull-down assays and finally, the interaction between LINC00106 and its target protein and the p53 signaling pathway was studied using a dual-luciferase reporter assay.  Results:   In PCa, LINC00106 was over-expressed in comparison to normal tissues, and it was linked to an unfavorableprognosis. In vitro and in vivo analyses showed that downregulating LINC00106 decreased PCa cells'ability to proliferate and migrate. A common regulatory axis generated by LINC00106 and RPS19BP1 prevents p53 activity.

We focus herein on the results of our new investigations into: (a) the structural chemistry of a family of rigid mono(thiosemicarbazone) ligands characterized by extended and aromatic backbones and (b) the formation of their corresponding thiosemicarbazonato Zn(II) and Cu(II) metal complexes. The synthesis of new ligands and their Zn(II) complexes was performed using a rapid, efficient and straightforward microwave-assisted method which superseded their preparation by conventional heating. We describe hereby new microwave irradiation protocols that are suitable for both imine bond formation reactions in the thiosemicabazone ligand synthesis and for Zn(II) metalation reactions. The new thiosemicarbazone ligands, denoted HL, mono(4-R-3-thiosemicarbazone)quinone, and their corresponding Zn(II) complexes, denoted ZnL2, mono(4-R-3-thiosemicarbazone)quinone, where R = H, Me, Ethyl, Allyl, and Phenyl, quinone = acenapthnenequinone (AN), aceanthrenequinone (AA), phenanthrenequinone (PH), and pyrene-4,5-dione (PY) were isolated and fully characterized spectroscopically and by mass spectrometry. A plethora of single crystal X-ray diffraction structures were obtained and analyzed and the geometries were also validated by DFT calculations. The Zn(II) complexes presented either distorted octahedral geometry or tetrahedral arrangements of the O/N/S donors around the metal center. The modification of the thiosemicarbazide moiety at the exocyclic N atoms with a range of organic linkers was also explored, opening the way to bioconjugation protocols for these compounds. The radiolabeling of these thiosemicarbazones with 64Cu was achieved under mild conditions for the first time: this cyclotron-available radioisotope of copper (t1/2 = 12.7 h; β+ 17.8%; β- 38.4%) is well-known for its proficiency in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and for its theranostic potential, on the basis of the preclinical and clinical cancer research of established bis(thiosemicarbazones), such as the hypoxia tracer 64Cu-labeled copper(diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone)], [64Cu]Cu(ATSM). Our labeling reactions proceeded in high radiochemical incorporation (>80% for the most sterically unencumbered ligands) showing promise of these species as building blocks for theranostics and synthetic scaffolds for multimodality imaging probes. The corresponding ""cold"" Cu(II) metalations were also performed under the mild conditions mimicking the radiolabeling protocols. Interestingly, room temperature or mild heating led to Cu(II) incorporation in the 1:1, as well as 1:2 metal: ligand ratios in the new complexes, as evident from extensive mass spectrometry investigations backed by EPR measurements, and the formation of Cu(L)2-type species prevails, especially for the AN-Ph thiosemicarbazone ligand (L-). The cytotoxicity levels of a selection of ligands and Zn(II) complexes in this class were further tested in commonly used human cancer cell lines (HeLa, human cervical cancer cells, and PC-3, human prostate cancer cells). Tests showed that their IC50 levels are comparable to that of the clinical drug cis-platin, evaluated under similar conditions. The cellular internalizations of the selected ZnL2-type compounds Zn(AN-Allyl)2, Zn(AA-Allyl)2, Zn(PH-Allyl)2, and Zn(PY-Allyl)2 were evaluated in living PC-3 cells using laser confocal fluorescent spectroscopy and these experiments showed exclusively cytoplasmic distributions.""","""['Fernando Cortezon-Tamarit', 'Kexin Song', 'Navaratnarajah Kuganathan', 'Rory L Arrowsmith', 'Sara Raquel Mota Merelo de Aguiar', 'Philip A Waghorn', 'Adam Brookfield', 'Muralidharan Shanmugam', 'David Collison', 'Haobo Ge', 'Gabriele Kociok-Köhn', 'Charareh Pourzand', 'Jonathan Robin Dilworth', 'Sofia Ioana Pascu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""ACS Omega""","""['Applications of ""Hot"" and ""Cold"" Bis(thiosemicarbazonato) Metal Complexes in Multimodal Imaging.', 'Synthesis, Characterization, and in Vitro Anticancer Activity of Copper and Zinc Bis(Thiosemicarbazone) Complexes.', 'Functional, Aromatic, and Fluorinated Monothiosemicarbazones: Investigations into Their Structures and Activity toward the Gallium-68 Incorporation by Microwave Irradiation.', 'Versatile new bis(thiosemicarbazone) bifunctional chelators: synthesis, conjugation to bombesin(7-14)-NH(2), and copper-64 radiolabeling.', 'Crystal structures, spectroscopic properties of new cobalt(II), nickel(II), zinc(II) and palladium(II) complexes derived from 2-acetyl-5-chloro thiophene thiosemicarbazone: Anticancer evaluation.']"""

Time-to-event outcome is often the focus in cohort studies, and the research goal is to assess the association between the event risk and risk factors. In this paper, we propose a novel goodness-of-fit two-phase sampling design for time-to-event outcomes when some covariates (e.g., biomarkers) can only be measured on a subgroup of study subjects.  Methods:   Assuming that an external model, which can be the well-established risk models such as the Gail model for breast cancer, Gleason score for prostate cancer, and Framingham risk models for heart diseases, or built from preliminary data, is available to relate the outcome and complete covariates, we propose to oversample subjects with worse goodness-of-fit (GOF) based on an external survival model and time-to-event. With the cases and controls sampled using the GOF two-phase design, the inverse sampling probability weighting method is used to estimate the log hazard ratio of both incomplete and complete covariates. We conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the efficiency gain of our proposed GOF two-phase sampling designs over case-cohort study designs.  Results:   Through extensive simulations based on a dataset from the New York University Women's Health Study, we showed that the proposed GOF two-phase sampling designs were unbiased and generally had higher efficiency compared to the standard case-cohort study designs.  Conclusion:   In cohort studies with rare outcomes, an important design question is how to select informative subjects to reduce sampling costs while maintaining statistical efficiency. Our proposed goodness-of-fit two-phase design provides efficient alternatives to standard case-cohort designs for assessing the association between time-to-event outcome and risk factors.

Nevertheless, the specific mechanism underlying HNRNPA2B1 functions in PCa remains not clear. In our study, we proved that HNRNPA2B1 promoted the progression of PCa through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Further, we found that HNRNPA2B1 induced the maturation of miR-25-3p/miR-93-5p by recognizing primary miR-25/93 (pri-miR-25/93) through N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-dependent manner. In addition, both miR-93-5p and miR-25-3p were proven as tumor promoters in PCa. Interestingly, by mass spectrometry analysis and mechanical experiments, we found that casein kinase 1 delta (CSNK1D) could mediate the phosphorylation of HNRNPA2B1 to enhance its stability. Moreover, we further proved that miR-93-5p targeted BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor (BAMBI) mRNA to reduce its expression, thereby activating transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway. At the same time, miR-25-3p targeted forkhead box O3 (FOXO3) to inactivate FOXO pathway. These results collectively indicated that CSNK1D stabilized HNRNPA2B1 facilitates the processing of miR-25-3p/miR-93-5p to regulate TGF-β and FOXO pathways, resulting in PCa progression.

Methods:   A retrospective study was conducted of HIV-positive patients from a single institution with elevated PSA and diagnosis of PCa by biopsy. PCa features, HIV characteristics, treatment type, toxicities, and outcomes were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine progression-free survival (PFS).  Results:   Seventy-nine HIV-positive patients were included with a median age at PCa diagnosis of 61 years-old and median duration from HIV infection to PCa diagnosis of 21 years. The median PSA level at diagnosis and Gleason Score was 6.85 ng/mL and 7, respectively. The 5-year PFS was 82.5% with the lowest survival observed in patients treated with radical prostatectomy (RP) + radiation therapy (RT), followed by cryosurgery (CS). There were no reports of PCa-specific deaths, and the 5-year overall survival was 97.5%. CD4 count declined post-treatment in pooled treatment groups that included RT (P = .02).  Conclusion:   We present the characteristics and outcomes of the largest cohort of HIV-positive men with prostate cancer in published literature. RP and RT ± ADT is well-tolerated in HIV-positive patients with PCa as seen by the adequate biochemical control and mild toxicity. CS resulted in worse PFS compared to alternative treatments for patients within the same PCa risk group. A decline in CD4 counts was observed in patients treated RT, and further studies are needed to investigate this relationship.

Our scheme can discriminate early PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia with a diagnostic sensitivity of 92.3%, which is much higher that of 58.3% for conventional PSA tests.

Tissue contaminants, such as floaters, represent unexpected tissue. While human pathologists are extensively trained to consider and detect tissue contaminants, we examined their impact on ML models. We trained 4 whole slide models. Three operate in placenta for 1) detection of decidual arteriopathy (DA), 2) estimation of gestational age (GA), and 3) classification of macroscopic placental lesions. We also developed a model to detect prostate cancer in needle biopsies. We designed experiments wherein patches of contaminant tissue are randomly sampled from known slides and digitally added to patient slides and measured model performance. We measured the proportion of attention given to contaminants and examined the impact of contaminants in T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) feature space. Every model showed performance degradation in response to one or more tissue contaminants. DA detection balanced accuracy decreased from 0.74 to 0.69 +/- 0.01 with addition of 1 patch of prostate tissue for every 100 patches of placenta (1% contaminant).

Cuproptosis, as a novel regulated cell death, remains unclear in PCa. This study aimed to investigate the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in molecular stratification, prognostic prediction, and clinical decision-making in PCa.  Methods:   Cuproptosis-related molecular subtypes were identified by consensus clustering analysis. A prognostic signature was constructed with LASSO cox regression analyses with 10-fold cross-validation. It was further validated in the internal validation cohort and eight external validation cohorts. The tumor microenvironment between the two risk groups was compared using the ssGSEA and ESTIMATE algorithms. Finally, qRT-PCR was used to explore the expression and regulation of these model genes at the cellular level. Furthermore, 4D Label-Free LC-MS/MS and RNAseq were used to investigate the changes in CRGs at protein and RNA levels after the knockdown of the key model gene B4GALNT4.  Results:   Two cuproptosis-related molecular subtypes with significant differences in prognoses, clinical features, and the immune microenvironment were identified. Immunosuppressive microenvironments were associated with poor prognosis. A prognostic signature comprised of five genes (B4GALNT4, FAM83D, COL1A, CHRM3, and MYBPC1) was constructed. The performance and generalizability of the signature were validated in eight completely independent datasets from multiple centers. Patients in the high-risk group had a poorer prognosis, more immune cell infiltration, more active immune-related functions, higher expression of human leukocyte antigen and immune checkpoint molecules, and higher immune scores. In addition, anti-PDL-1 immunotherapy prediction, somatic mutation, chemotherapy response prediction, and potential drug prediction were also analyzed based on the risk signature. The validation of five model genes' expression and regulation in qPCR was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed that the key model gene B4GALNT4 might regulate CRGs through protein modification after transcription.  Conclusion:   The cuproptosis-related molecular subtypes and the prognostic signature identified in this study could be used to predict the prognosis and contribute to the clinical decision-making of PCa. Furthermore, we identified a potential cuproptosis-related oncogene B4GALNT4 in PCa, which could be used as a target to treat PCa in combination with cuproptosis.""","""['Jili Zhang', 'Shaoqin Jiang', 'Di Gu', 'Wenhui Zhang', 'Xianqi Shen', 'Min Qu', 'Chenghua Yang', 'Yan Wang', 'Xu Gao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""['Identification of cuproptosis-related subtypes, construction of a prognosis model, and tumor microenvironment landscape in gastric cancer.', 'Identification and validation of a novel cuproptosis-related genes signature associated with prognosis, clinical implications and immunotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma.', 'Prognostic and Immunological Significance of the Molecular Subtypes and Risk Signatures Based on Cuproptosis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.', 'Identification of a novel cuproptosis-related gene signature and integrative analyses in patients with lower-grade gliomas.', 'Molecular subtypes based on cuproptosis-related genes and tumor microenvironment infiltration characteristics in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.']"""

Patients with low- or intermediate-risk PCa were equally assigned to 3 SBRT dose levels: 35, 37.5, and 40 Gy per 5 fractions. The primary endpoint was the occurrence rate of late grade ≥2 genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events at 2 years, while the secondary endpoint was the 2-year biochemical relapse-free (bRF) rate.

However, α-emitting isotopes are difficult to image because of low administered activities and a low fraction of suitable γ-emissions. The in vivo generator 134Ce/134La has been proposed as a potential PET imaging surrogate for the therapeutic nuclides 225Ac and 227Th. In this report, we detail efficient radiolabeling methods using the 225Ac-chelators DOTA and MACROPA. These methods were applied to radiolabeling of prostate cancer imaging agents, including PSMA-617 and MACROPA-PEG4-YS5, for evaluation of their in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics and comparison to the corresponding 225Ac analogs. Methods: Radiolabeling was performed by mixing DOTA/MACROPA chelates with 134Ce/134La in NH4OAc, pH 8.0, at room temperature, and radiochemical yields were monitored by radio-thin-layer chromatography. In vivo biodistributions of 134Ce-DOTA/MACROPA.NH2 complexes were assayed through dynamic small-animal PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies over 1 h in healthy C57BL/6 mice, compared with free 134CeCl3 In vivo, preclinical imaging of 134Ce-PSMA-617 and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 was performed on 22Rv1 tumor-bearing male nu/nu-mice. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed for 134Ce/225Ac-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 conjugates. Results: 134Ce-MACROPA.NH2 demonstrated near-quantitative labeling with 1:1 ligand-to-metal ratios at room temperature, whereas a 10:1 ligand-to-metal ratio and elevated temperatures were required for DOTA. Rapid urinary excretion and low liver and bone uptake were seen for 134Ce/225Ac-DOTA/MACROPA. NH2 conjugates in comparison to free 134CeCl3 confirmed high in vivo stability. An interesting observation during the radiolabeling of tumor-targeting vectors PSMA-617 and MACROPA-PEG4-YS5-that the daughter 134La was expelled from the chelate after the decay of parent 134Ce-was confirmed through radio-thin-layer chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Both conjugates, 134Ce-PSMA-617 and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5, displayed tumor uptake in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. The ex vivo biodistribution of 134Ce-MACROPA.NH2, 134Ce-DOTA and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 corroborated well with the respective 225Ac-conjugates. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the PET imaging potential for 134Ce/134La-labeled small-molecule and antibody agents. The similar 225Ac and 134Ce/134La-chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics suggest that the 134Ce/134La pair may act as a PET imaging surrogate for 225Ac-based radioligand therapies.""","""['Kondapa Naidu Bobba', 'Anil P Bidkar', 'Niranjan Meher', 'Cyril Fong', 'Anju Wadhwa', 'Suchi Dhrona', 'Alex Sorlin', 'Scott Bidlingmaier', 'Becka Shuere', 'Jiang He', 'David M Wilson', 'Bin Liu', 'Youngho Seo', 'Henry F VanBrocklin', 'Robert R Flavell']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Evaluation of 134Ce as a PET imaging surrogate for antibody drug conjugates incorporating 225Ac.', 'First In\xa0Vivo and Phantom Imaging of Cyclotron-Produced 133La as a Theranostic Radionuclide for 225Ac and 135La.', 'Treatment of Prostate Cancer with CD46-targeted 225Ac Alpha Particle Radioimmunotherapy.', 'Efficient Production of the PET Radionuclide 133La for Theranostic Purposes in Targeted Alpha Therapy Using the 134Ba(p,2n)133La Reaction.', 'Modulating the pharmacokinetic profile of Actinium-225-labeled macropa-derived radioconjugates by dual targeting of PSMA and albumin.', 'Targeted Alpha-Particle Therapy: A Review of Current Trials.', 'Covalent Proteins as Targeted Radionuclide Therapies Enhance Antitumor Effects.']"""

The structures of the twenty-four newly synthesized compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and ESI-MS. The in vitro anti-cancer activity against chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562), erythroleukemia cells (HEL), human prostate cancer cells (LNCaP), and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) of the target compounds was evaluated. Among them, compounds 15d, 15f, 15h, and 15i showed the significantly (P < 0.01) stronger growth inhibitory activity on K562 than those of the positive controls of paclitaxel and colchicine, while compounds 15a, 15d, 15e, and 15h displayed significantly stronger growth inhibitory activity on HEL than those of the positive controls. However, all the target compounds exhibited weaker growth inhibition activity against K562 and HeLa than those of the positive controls. The selectivity ratio of compounds 15h, 15d, and 15i were significantly higher than those of other active compounds, indicating that these three compounds had the lower hepatotoxicity. Several compounds displayed strong inhibition against leukemia cells. They inhibited tubulin polymerization, disrupted cellular microtubule networks by targeting the colchicine site, and promoted cell cycle arrest of leukemia cells at G2/M phase and cell apoptosis, as well as inhibiting angiogenesis.

However, suppression of EGFR did not improve the patient outcome, possibly due to the activation of PI3K/Akt signaling in PCa. Compounds able to suppress both PI3K/Akt and EGFR signaling may be effective for treating advanced PCa.  Purpose:   We examined if caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) simultaneously suppresses the EGFR and Akt signaling, migration and tumor growth in PCa cells.  Methods:   Wound healing assay, transwell migration assay and xenograft mice model were used to determine the effects of CAPE on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunohistochemistry staining were performed to determine the effects of CAPE on EGFR and Akt signaling.  Results:   CAPE treatment decreased the gene expression of HRAS, RAF1, AKT2, GSK3A, and EGF and the protein expression of phospho-EGFR (Y845, Y1069, Y1148, Y1173), phospho-FAK, Akt, and ERK1/2 in PCa cells. CAPE treatment inhibited the EGF-induced migration of PCa cells. Combined treatment of CAPE with EGFR inhibitor gefitinib showed additive inhibition on migration and proliferation of PCa cells. Injection of CAPE (15 mg/kg/3 days) for 14 days suppressed the tumor growth of prostate xenografts in nude mice as well as suppressed the levels of Ki67, phospho-EGFR Y845, MMP-9, phospho-Akt S473, phospho-Akt T308, Ras, and Raf-1 in prostate xenografts.

Methods:   In this retrospective, multicenter study, 272 patients who underwent salvage radiotherapy (RT) ± androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for recurrent prostate cancer after RP between 2007 and 2021 were analysed. Univariate analyses of time to biochemical and clinical relapse after salvage therapies were conducted using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank tests. Multivariate analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards model to determine the risk factors for disease relapse.  Results:   Median age was 65 (48-82) years. All patients underwent salvage prostate bed RT. Pelvic lymphatic RT was performed in 66 patients (24.3%) and ADT was included in 158 (58.1%) patients. The median PSA value before RT was 0.35 ng/mL. The median follow-up time was 64 (12-180) months. 5-years bRFS, cRFS, and OS were 75.1%, 84.8%, and 94.9% respectively. In multivariate cox regression analysis; seminal vesicle invasion (HR 8.64, 95% CI 3.47-21.48, p < 0.001), pre-RT PSA higher than 0.14 ng/mL (HR 3.79, 95% CI 1.47-9.78, p = 0.006), and ≥ 2 positive pelvic lymph nodes (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.11-5.62, p = 0.027) were found to be unfavorable prognostic factors for bRFS.  Conclusion:   Salvage RT ± ADT provided 5-years biochemical disease control in 75.1% of patients.

Material and methods:   Consecutive patients with high-grade prostate cancer and pre-treatment MRI treated with radiotherapy between 01/12/2007 and 1/08/2013 at two cancer centres were included. Cancers were dichotomised as normoxic or hypoxic using a biopsy-based 32-gene hypoxia signature (Ragnum signature). Prostate segmentation was performed on axial T2-weighted (T2w) sequences using RayStation (v9.1). Histogram standardisation was applied prior to RF extraction. PyRadiomics (v3.0.1) was used to extract RFs for analysis. The cohort was split 80:20 into training and test sets. Six different ML classifiers for distinguishing hypoxia were trained and tuned using five different feature selection models and fivefold cross-validation with 20 repeats. The model with the highest mean validation area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was tested on the unseen set, and AUCs were compared via DeLong test with 95% confidence interval (CI).

According to ISUP grade, those patients were divided into low-risk group [≤grade 2, n=26, aged 71 (64.0, 5.2) years] and high-risk group[≥grade 3, n=66, aged 70.5 (63.0, 74.0) years]. The interobserver consistency test for ADC values was evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). The differences in total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) between the two groups were compared and the χ2 test was used to compare the differences in the risk of prostate cancer in the transitional and peripheral zone. Independent correlation factors for prostate cancer risk were analyzed by logistic regression using high and low risk of prostate cancer as dependent variables, including factors such as anatomical zone, tPSA, apparent diffusion coefficient mean (ADCmean), apparent diffusion coefficient minimum (ADCmin) and age. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess the efficacy of the combined models of anatomical zone, tPSA, and anatomical partitioning+tPSA for diagnosing prostate cancer risk. Results: The ICC values of the ADCmean and ADCmin between the observers were 0.906 and 0.885, respectively, with good agreement. The tPSA in the low-risk group was lower than that in the high-risk group [19.64 (10.29, 35.18) ng/ml vs 72.42 (24.79, 187.98) ng/ml; P<0.001]; the risk of prostate cancer in the peripheral zone was higher than that in the transitional zone, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.01).

Methods: A total of 1 368 patients, aged from 30 to 92 (69.4±8.2) years, from 3 tertiary medical centers in Jiangsu Province were retrospectively collected from May 2015 to December 2020, including 412 cases of csPCa, 242 cases of clinically insignificant prostate cancer (ciPCa) and 714 cases of benign prostate lesions. The data of center 1 and center 2 were randomly divided into training cohort and internal testing cohort at a ratio of 7∶3 by random number sampling without replacement using Python Random package, and the data of center 3 were used as the independent external testing cohort. The training cohort includs 243 cases of csPCa, 135 cases of ciPCa and 384 cases of benign lesions, the internal testing cohort includs 104 cases of csPCa, 58 cases of ciPCa and 165 cases of benign lesions, and the external testing cohort includs 65 cases of csPCa, 49 cases of ciPCa and 165 cases of benign lesions. The radiomics features were extracted on T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient map, and optimal radiomics features were selected by using Pearson correlation coefficient method and analysis of variance. The ML models were built using two ML algorithms, including support vector machine and random forest (RF) and were further tested in the internal testing cohort and external testing cohort. Finally, the PI-RADS scores evaluated by the radiologists were adjusted by the ML models which had superior diagnostic performance, namely adjusted PI-RADS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ML models and PI-RADS. DeLong test was used to compare the areas under curve (AUC) of models with those of PI-RADS. Results: For PCa diagnosis, in internal testing cohort, the AUC of ML model using RF algorithm and PI-RADS were 0.869 (95%CI: 0.830-0.908) and 0.874 (95%CI: 0.836-0.913), respectively, and the difference between the model and PI-RADS did not reach to the statistical significance (P=0.793). In the external testing cohort, the AUC of model and PI-RADS were 0.845 (95%CI: 0.794-0.897) and 0.915 (95%CI: 0.880-0.951), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (P=0.01). For csPCa diagnosis, the AUC of ML model using RF algorithm and PI-RADS were 0.874 (95%CI: 0.834-0.914) and 0.892 (95%CI: 0.857-0.927), respectively, in internal testing cohort, and the difference between the model and PI-RADS was not statistically significant (P=0.341). In the external testing cohort, the AUC of model and PI-RADS were 0.876 (95%CI: 0.831-0.920) and 0.884 (95%CI: 0.841-0.926), respectively, and the difference between the model and PI-RADS was not statistically significant (P=0.704). When PI-RADS assessment was adjusted with the assistance of ML models, the specificities increased from 63.0% to 80.0% in the internal testing cohort and from 92.7% to 93.3% in the external test group in diagnosing PCa. In diagnosing csPCa, the specificities increased from 52.5% to 72.6% in the internal testing cohort and from 75.2% to 79.9% in the external testing cohort. Conclusions: The ML models based on bpMRI showed comparable diagnostic performance to PI-RADS assessed by senior radiologists and achieved good generalization ability in both diagnosing PCa and csPCa.

Because the prostate-specific antigen test is used in diagnostics, PCa is more often diagnosed in the early stages, making radical treatment of the disease possible. However, it is estimated that over a million men worldwide suffer from radical treatment-related complications. Thus, focal treatment has been proposed as a solution, which aims to destroy the predominant lesson that determines the progression of the disease. The main objective of our study is to compare the quality of life and efficacy of patients diagnosed with PCa before and after the treatment with focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy and to compare results with focal low-dose-rate brachytherapy and active surveillance.  Methods and analysis:   150 patients diagnosed with low-risk or favourable intermediate-risk PCa who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients are going to be randomly assigned to the study groups: focal high-dose-rate brachytherapy (group 1), focal low-dose-rate brachytherapy (group 2) and active surveillance (group 3). The study's primary outcomes are quality of life after the procedure and time without biochemical disease recurrence. The secondary outcomes are early and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal reactions after the focal high-dose and low-dose-rate brachytherapies and evaluation of the importance and significance of in vivo dosimetry used for high-dose-rate brachytherapy.

The absence of specific monoclonal antibodies (mAb) has limited its detection and our understanding of its oncogenic function.  Methods:   An ETV1 specific rabbit mAb (29E4) was raised using an immunogenic peptide. Key residues essential for its binding were probed by ELISA and its binding kinetics were measured by surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). Its selective binding to ETV1 was assessed by immunoblots and immunofluorescence assays (IFA), and by both single and double-immuno-histochemistry (IHC) assays on prostate cancer tissue specimens.  Results:   Immunoblot results showed that the mAb is highly specific and lacked cross-reactivity with other ETS factors. A minimal epitope with two phenylalanine residues at its core was found to be required for effective mAb binding. SPRi measurements revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant in the picomolar range, confirming its high affinity. ETV1 (+) tumors were detected in prostate cancer tissue microarray cases evaluated. IHC staining of whole-mounted sections revealed glands with a mosaic staining pattern of cells that are partly ETV1 (+) and interspersed with ETV1 (-) cells. Duplex IHC, using ETV1 and ERG mAbs, detected collision tumors containing glands with distinct ETV1 (+) and ERG (+) cells.  Conclusions:   The selective detection of ETV1 by the 29E4 mAb in immunoblots, IFA, and IHC assays using human prostate tissue specimens reveals a potential utility for the diagnosis, the prognosis of prostate adenocarcinoma and other cancers, and the stratification of patients for treatment by ETV1 inhibitors.""","""['Cara Schafer', 'Denise Young', 'Harpreet Singh', 'Rahul Jayakrishnan', 'Sreedatta Banerjee', 'Yingjie Song', 'Albert Dobi', 'Gyorgy Petrovics', 'Sudhir Srivastava', 'Shiv Srivastava', 'Isabell A Sesterhenn', 'Gregory T Chesnut', 'Shyh-Han Tan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Immunol Methods""","""['Distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create oncogenic ETS gene fusions in prostate cancer.', 'Molecular characterisation of ERG, ETV1 and PTEN gene loci identifies patients at low and high risk of death from prostate cancer.', 'YK-4-279 inhibits ERG and ETV1 mediated prostate cancer cell invasion.', 'ETV1, 4 and 5: an oncogenic subfamily of ETS transcription factors.', 'ETS factors in prostate cancer.']"""

The KB approach provided dose-volume objectives for specific OARs only and not PTV. Bladder, rectum and femoral heads were considered in the model. The KB-model was successfully trained on 51 plans and then validated on 20 new patients.

Immunoassay based on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) frequency shift has been proven to be particularly suitable for detecting large biomolecules with high reproducibility. Along similar lines, the present study developed a SERS-based biosensor that simultaneously detects t-PSA and f-PSA. The 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (MBA) on the immunocapture substrate is coupled to the t-PSA antibody through the carboxyl group, and the combination of t-PSA induces the Raman frequency shifts of MBA. The immunocolloidal gold attached with f-PSA antibodies selectively capture the f-PSA that immobilized on the MBA-modified SERS substrates, allowing for f-PSA quantification according to the SERS intensities of the 5, 5'-Dithiobis (succinimidyl-2-nitrobenzoate) (DSNB) probe. The results show that f-PSA and t-PSA have good linear response in the concentration scale of 0.1-20 ng/mL, and 1-200 ng/mL, respectively.

In this study, we intend to explore the long-term trend in second BC and RC incidence among PCa patients undergoing radiotherapy.  Method:   We identified first primary PCa patients diagnosed between 1975 and 2014 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-9 cancer registries. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated by calendar year of diagnosis among PCa patients receiving radiotherapy and not. P trends were evaluated using Poisson regression. 10-year cumulative incidence of BC and RC was calculated utilizing competing risk regression model.  Result:   Of PCa patients treated with radiotherapy, SIRs of BC increased from .82 (95% CI: .35- 1.61) in 1980-1984 to 1.58 (95% CI: 1.48-1.68) in 2010-2014 (Ptrend=.003).

The 10-year cumulative incidence of BC increased from 1975-1984 (.04%) to 2005-2014 (.15%) among PCa treated with radiotherapy. Simultaneously, the 10-year cumulative incidence of RC was demonstrated to range from 1975-1984 (.02%) to 2005-2014 (.11%).  Conclusion:   we have observed an increasing trend in second BC and RC incidence in PCa patients receiving radiotherapy.

Methods:   Here, we describe the molecular features of two cases of primary prostate cancer with MLH1 loss detected by immunohistochemistry, and in one case, confirmed via transcriptomic profiling.  Results:   Both cases were microsatellite stable on standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, but showed evidence of MSI on a newer PCR-based long mononucleotide repeat (LMR) assay and by next-generation sequencing. Germline testing was negative for Lynch syndrome-associated mutations in both cases. Targeted or whole-exome tumor sequencing using multiple commercial/academic platforms (Foundation, Tempus, JHU, and UW-OncoPlex) showed modestly elevated, though variable, tumor mutation burden estimates (2.3-10 mutations/Mb) consistent with MMRd, but without identifiable pathogenic single-nucleotide or indel mutations in MLH1. Copy-number analysis confirmed biallelic MLH1 loss in one case and monoallelic MLH1 loss in the second case, without evidence of MLH1 promoter hypermethylation in either. The second patient was treated with single-agent pembrolizumab and demonstrated a short-lived prostate-specific antigen response.

Critically, the molecular drivers behind resistance are poorly understood. To address this question, we created an isogenic model of prostate cancer exhibiting more aggressive characteristics to better understand the molecular signatures associated with resistance and metastasis. 22Rv1 cells were repeatedly exposed to DNA damage daily for 6 weeks, similar to patient treatment regimes. Using Illumina Methylation EPIC arrays and RNA-seq, we compared DNA methylation and transcriptional profiles between the parental 22Rv1 cell line and the lineage exposed to prolonged DNA damage. Here we show that repeated DNA damage drives the molecular evolution of cancer cells to a more aggressive phenotype and identify molecular candidates behind this process. Total DNA methylation was increased while RNA-seq demonstrated these cells had dysregulated expression of genes involved in metabolism and the unfolded protein response (UPR) with Asparagine synthetase (ASNS) identified as central to this process. Despite the limited overlap between RNA-seq and DNA methylation, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase-like (OGDHL) was identified as altered in both data sets.

Methods:   The major-ampullate-dragline from Nephila edulis was used for spider silk nerve reconstruction (SSNR). After removal of the prostate with either uni- or bilateral nerve-sparing, the spider silk was laid out on the site of the neurovascular bundles. Data analysis included inflammatory markers and patient reported outcomes.  Results:   Six patients underwent RARP with SSNR. In 50% of the cases, only a unilateral nerve-sparing was performed, bilateral nerve-sparing could be performed in three patients. Placement of the spider silk conduit was uneventful, contact of the spider silk with the surrounding tissue was mostly sufficient for a stable connection with the proximal and distal ends of the dissected bundles. Inflammatory markers peaked until postoperative day 1 but stabilized until discharge without any need for antibiotic treatment throughout the hospital stay. One patient was readmitted due to a urinary tract infection. Three patients reported about erections sufficient for penetration after three months with a continuous improvement of erectile function both after bi- and unilateral nerve-sparing with SSNR up to the last follow-up after 18 months.  Conclusion:   In this analysis of the first RARP with SSNR, a simple intraoperative handling without major complications was demonstrated. While the series provides evidence that SSNR is safe and feasible, a prospective randomized trial with long-term follow-up is needed to identify further improvement in postoperative erectile function due to the spider silk-directed nerve regeneration.""","""['Nina N Harke', 'Sarah Strauss', 'Inga Peters', 'Olga Katzendorn', 'Hossein Tezval', 'Markus A Kuczyk', 'Peter M Vogt']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""World J Urol""","""['Retrospective Concomitant Nonrandomized Comparison of ""Touch"" Cautery Versus Athermal Dissection of the Prostatic Vascular Pedicles and Neurovascular Bundles During Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Pathological confirmation of nerve-sparing types performed during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).', 'Chitosan membranes applied on the prostatic neurovascular bundles after nerve-sparing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy: a phase II study.', 'Retzius Sparing Radical Prostatectomy Versus Robot-assisted Radical Prostatectomy: Which Technique Is More Beneficial for Prostate Cancer Patients (MASTER Study)?

Methods:   11,071 patients from a large contemporary registry-based nationwide cohort with RP as primary treatment between 1995 and 2019 were included. Preoperative risk stratification, postoperative outcomes, and 10 years other-cause mortality (OCM) were analyzed.  Results:   After 2005, the proportion of low-risk prostate cancer (PCa) decreased from 39.6% to 25.5% in 2010 and decreased further to 15.5% in 2015, and 9.4% in 2019 (p < 0.001). The proportion of high-risk cases increased from 13.1% in 2005 to 23.1% in 2010 and 36.7% in 2015, and 40.4% in 2019 (p < 0.001).

The overall 10 years OCM was 7.7%.  Conclusion:   The current analysis documents a clear shift in utilization of RP toward higher-risk PCa in men with long life expectancy.

In this context, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) allows the delivery of high doses, with curative intent. Magnetic Resonance guided Radiation Therapy (MRgRT) has shown promising results in terms of safety, feasibility and efficacy of delivering SBRT thanks to the enhanced soft tissue contrast and the online adaptive workflow. This multicentric retrospective analysis evaluates the feasibility and efficacy of PC reirradiation, using a 0.35 T hybrid MR delivery unit.  Methods:   Patients affected by local recurrences of PC and treated in five institutions between 2019 and 2022 were retrospectively collected. All patients had undergone previous Radiation Therapy (RT) in definitive or adjuvant setting. Re-treatment MRgSBRT was delivered with a total dose ranging from 25 to 40 Gy in 5 fractions. Toxicity according to CTCAE v 5.0 and treatment response were assessed at the end of the treatment and at follow-up.  Results:   Eighteen patients were included in this analysis. All patients had previously undergone external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) up to a total dose of 59.36 to 80 Gy. Median cumulative biologically effective dose (BED) of SBRT re-treatment was 213,3 Gy (103,1-560), considering an α/β of 1.5. Complete response was achieved in 4 patients (22.2%). No grade ≥ 2 acute genitourinary (GU) toxicity events were recorded, while gastrointestinal (GI) acute toxicity events occurred in 4 patients (22.2%).  Conclusion:   The low rates of acute toxicity of this experience encourages considering MRgSBRT a feasibile therapeutic approach for the treatment of clinically relapsed PC. Accurate gating of target volumes, the online adaptive planning workflow and the high definition of MRI treatment images allow delivering high doses to the PTV while efficiently sparing organs at risk (OARs).""","""['Luca Boldrini', 'Angela Romano', 'Giuditta Chiloiro', 'Stefanie Corradini', 'Viola De Luca', 'Valeria Verusio', ""Andrea D'Aviero"", 'Alessandra Castelluccia', 'Anna Rita Alitto', 'Francesco Catucci', 'Gianmarco Grimaldi', 'Christian Trapp', 'Juliane Hörner-Rieber', 'Domenico Marchesano', 'Vincenzo Frascino', 'Gian Carlo Mattiucci', 'Vincenzo Valentini', 'Piercarlo Gentile', 'Maria Antonietta Gambacorta']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""['Linac-based stereotactic salvage reirradiation for intraprostatic prostate cancer recurrence: toxicity and outcomes.', 'Reirradiation for isolated local recurrence of prostate cancer: Mono-institutional series of 64 patients treated with salvage stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).', 'Interim Results of a Prospective Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Focal Stereotactic Reirradiation Trial for Locally Recurrent Prostate Cancer.', 'Stereotactic Magnetic Resonance-Guided Adaptive and Non-Adaptive Radiotherapy on Combination MR-Linear Accelerators: Current Practice and Future Directions.', 'Reirradiation spine stereotactic body radiation therapy for spinal metastases: systematic review.']"""

All cancer cases diagnosed among Brunei Darussalam citizens and permanent residents in the period 2011 to 2020 were included in the study. De-identified data were provided by the CanReg5 based BDCR, Ministry of Health Brunei Darussalam. The annual age-standardised incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 persons were standardised by the direct method using the World Health Organization (WHO) world standard population distribution. Joinpoint regression analyses were used to study the incidence and mortality trends of cancer in Brunei Darussalam over the 2011-2020 period. Trends were expressed as average annual percent change (AAPC) over 2011 to 2020, or annual percent change (APC) for a given time period. There were a total of 6,495 new cancer cases diagnosed and 3,359 death cases recorded from 2011 to 2020, in Brunei Darussalam. The five common cancers for males were colorectal, lung and bronchus, prostate, liver, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Among females, the five most common cancers were breast, colorectal, lung and bronchus, corpus uteri and cervix uteri. The five leading cancer deaths for males were lung and bronchus, colorectal, liver, prostate, and stomach, while for females, the five leading cancer deaths were breast, lung and bronchus, colorectal, ovary, and cervix uteri. There was a significant increase in the incidence trend of corpus uteri (AAPC[Formula: see text]) and a significant decline in the incidence trend for cervical cancer (AAPC[Formula: see text]) from 2011 to 2020.

These ROI-scale models suffer from weak labeling as histopathology results available for biopsy cores only approximate the distribution of cancer in the ROIs. ROI-scale models do not take advantage of contextual information that are normally considered by pathologists, i.e., they do not consider information about surrounding tissue and larger-scale trends when identifying cancer. We aim to improve cancer detection by taking a multi-scale, i.e., ROI-scale and biopsy core-scale, approach.  Methods:   Our multi-scale approach combines (i) an ""ROI-scale"" model trained using self-supervised learning to extract features from small ROIs and (ii) a ""core-scale"" transformer model that processes a collection of extracted features from multiple ROIs in the needle trace region to predict the tissue type of the corresponding core. Attention maps, as a by-product, allow us to localize cancer at the ROI scale.  Results:   We analyze this method using a dataset of micro-ultrasound acquired from 578 patients who underwent prostate biopsy, and compare our model to baseline models and other large-scale studies in the literature. Our model shows consistent and substantial performance improvements compared to ROI-scale-only models. It achieves [Formula: see text] AUROC, a statistically significant improvement over ROI-scale classification. We also compare our method to large studies on prostate cancer detection, using other imaging modalities.  Conclusions:   Taking a multi-scale approach that leverages contextual information improves prostate cancer detection compared to ROI-scale-only models. The proposed model achieves a statistically significant improvement in performance and outperforms other large-scale studies in the literature.

In many risk factors causing PCa, genes and viral infections are strong candidates for the development of prostate tumors. Indeed, tissue infections of PCa have been reported by the presence of several types of viruses including Human Papillomaviruses (HPV).  Objective:   the present study was planned to determine whether HPV DNA could be detected in the blood of known men with prostate cancer and to assess the potential association between HPV infection and clinico-pathological characteristics of the patients.  Materials and methods:   In order to achieve our objectives, 150 liquid blood samples were taken from Moroccan patients, 100 patients with PCa, and 50 control cases. The viral DNA was extracted, calibrated and the target genes were amplified by PCR using specific primers and the use of 2% agarose gel with visualization under UV.  Results:   Of the 100 samples tested, (10%) were infected with HPV), However, none of the control cases were infected with HPV. The analysis of the data made it possible to establish a correlation between the frequency of the viral infection of the human papilloma and the tumoral criteria.

Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for progression and PC mortality via parametric survival models (interval censoring) and Cox models, respectively.  Results:   Over a median (IQR) of 6.4 (1.3, 13.7) years, we observed 192 progression and 73 PC mortality events. Higher (i.e., healthier) 2021 Score + Diet and WCRF/AICR Scores were inversely associated with risk of PC progression (2021 + Diet: HRcontinuous = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.63-0.90.  Wcrf/aicr:   HRcontinuous = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.67-1.02) and mortality (2021 + Diet: HRcontinuous = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.45-0.93.  Wcrf/aicr:   HRcontinuous = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.57-0.89). The ACS Score + Alcohol was only associated with progression (HRcontinuous = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.81-0.98) while the 2021 Score was only associated with PC mortality (HRcontinuous = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.45-0.85). The 2015 was not associated with PC progression or mortality.  Conclusion:   Findings strengthen the evidence that behavioural modifications following a prostate cancer diagnosis may improve clinical outcomes.""","""['Crystal S Langlais', 'Rebecca E Graff', 'Erin L Van Blarigan', 'John M Neuhaus', 'Janet E Cowan', 'Jeanette M Broering', 'Peter Carroll', 'Stacey A Kenfield#', 'June M Chan#']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Br J Cancer""","""['Pre-diagnostic concordance with the WCRF/AICR guidelines and survival in European colorectal cancer patients: a cohort study.', 'The 2018 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) Score and All-Cause, Cancer, and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Risk: A Longitudinal Analysis in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.', 'Lung Cancer Risk in Men and Compliance with the 2018 WCRF/AICR Cancer Prevention Recommendations.', 'Association between the 2018 WCRF/AICR and the Low-Risk Lifestyle Scores with Colorectal Cancer Risk in the Predimed Study.', 'Adherence to the WCRF/AICR Dietary Recommendations for Cancer Prevention and Risk of Cancer in Elderly from Europe and the United States: A Meta-Analysis within the CHANCES Project.']"""

Aim was to determine the value of early static imaging in two-phase PET/CT. 100 men with newly diagnosed histopathologically confirmed untreated PCa who underwent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT from January 2017 to October 2019 were included. The two-phase imaging protocol consisted of an early static scan of the pelvis (6 min p.i.) and a late total-body scan (60 min p.i). Associations of semi-quantitative parameters derived via volumes of interest (VOI) with Gleason grade group and PSA were investigated. In 94/100 patients (94%) the primary tumor was detected in both phases. In 29/100 patients (29%) metastases were detected at a median PSA level of 32.2 ng/ml (0.41-503 ng/ml). In 71/100 patients (71%) without metastasis a median PSA level of 10.1 ng/ml (0.57-103 ng/ml) was observed (p = < 0.001). Primary tumors demonstrated a median standard uptake value maximum (SUVmax) of 8.2 (3.1-45.3) in early phase versus 12.2 (3.1-73.4) in late phase and a median standard uptake value mean (SUVmean) of 4.2 (1.6-24.1) in early phase versus 5.8 (1.6-39.9) in late phase, significantly increasing over time (p = < 0.001). Higher SUVmax and SUVmean were associated with higher Gleason grade group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.003, respectively) and higher PSA levels (p = < 0.001). In 13/100 patients the semi-quantitative parameters including SUVmax were declining in the late phase compared to early phase. Two-phase [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT demonstrates a high detection rate for primary tumor of untreated PCa of 94% and improves diagnostic accuracy. Higher PSA levels and Gleason grade group are associated with higher semi-quantitative parameters in the primary tumor. Early imaging provides additional information in a small sub-group with declining semi-quantitative parameters in the late phase.""","""['Friedrich Weitzer', 'Birgit Pernthaler', 'Elisabeth Plhak', 'Regina Riedl', 'Reingard Maria Aigner']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['More advantages in detecting bone and soft tissue metastases from prostate cancer using 18F-PSMA PET/CT.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in primary staging of prostate cancer: PSA and Gleason score predict the intensity of tracer accumulation in the primary tumour.', '68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT derived quantitative volumetric tumor parameters for classification and evaluation of therapeutic response of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients.', 'The Diagnostic Performance of 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT in Prostate Cancer Patients with Early Recurrence after Definitive Therapy with a PSA <10 ng/ml.', 'Use of gallium-68 prostate-specific membrane antigen positron-emission tomography for detecting lymph node metastases in primary and recurrent prostate cancer and location of recurrence after radical prostatectomy: an overview of the current literature.']"""

Therefore, we assessed the association between the characteristics of physical activity and overall and type-specific cancer incidence in Koreans and examined the differences in association according to obesity status. Using prospective data from 112,108 participants in the Health Examinees study-G from 2004 to 2013, we evaluated the association between leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and the incidence of overall and type-specific cancers using the Cox proportional hazards model. Self-reported LTPA participation, duration per week, intensity, type, and diversity were assessed. The incidence of overall and type-specific cancers, including colorectal, gastric, lung, breast, and prostate cancer and 13 obesity-related cancers, was identified using the Korea Central Cancer Registry from 1999 to 2018. Analyses were also stratified according to obesity status. In overweight males, participation in vigorous LTPA [HR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-0.97] and walking (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98) were associated with a lower risk of cancer overall. Regarding cancer types, climbing was marginally associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer in overweight males (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37-1.00). In normal-weight females, although there was an increased risk in those performing recreational activities, this risk was attenuated when those diagnosed with thyroid cancer were excluded. In the analysis for 13 obesity-related cancers, consistent associations were found. These findings suggest the need for greater public awareness regarding physical activity among overweight individuals within the Asian population.  Prevention relevance:   Overall cancer risk is associated with leisure-time physical activity such as duration, intensity, type, and diversity in overweight males, but not in the general population. The decreased risk was most noticeable for colorectal cancer.

Although there is no consensus on an optimal strategy, the determination of total serum prostate-specific antigen (tPSA) is the cornerstone for the detection of postoperative biochemical recurrence (BCR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic utility of serial tPSA levels together with other clinicopathological factors and to assess the impact of a commentary algorithm implemented in our laboratory information system.  Methods:   A descriptive and retrospective study of patients with clinically localized PCa who underwent RP. BCR-free survival was calculated over time (Kaplan-Meier analysis), and the ability of different clinicopathological factors to predict BCR was studied (univariate and multivariate analyses) with Cox models.  Results:   A total of 203 patients underwent RP, of whom 51 presented with BCR during follow-up. In the multivariate model, doubling of tPSA, the Gleason score, tumour stage and tPSA nadir were detected as independent predictors of BCR.  Conclusion:   A patient with undetectable tPSA after 1959 days of RP is unlikely to develop BCR, regardless of preoperative or pathologic risk factors. Furthermore, doubling of tPSA in the first 2 years of follow-up was the main prognostic factor for BCR in patients undergoing RP.

The relationship between different types of normal and cancer stem cells is highly controversial and poorly understood. Here, we carried out gene expression network analysis of normal and tumor samples from genetically heterogeneous mice to create network metagenes for visualization of stem-cell networks, rather than individual stem-cell markers, at the single-cell level during multistage carcinogenesis. We combined this approach with lineage tracing and single-cell RNASeq of stem cells and their progeny, identifying a previously unrecognized hierarchy in which Lgr6 + stem cells from tumors generate progeny that express a range of other stem-cell markers including Sox2, Pitx1, Foxa1, Klf5 , and Cd44 . Our data identify a convergence of multiple stem-cell and tumor-suppressor pathways in benign tumor cells expressing markers of lineage plasticity and oxidative stress. This same single-cell population expresses network metagenes corresponding to markers of cancer drug resistance in human tumors of the skin, lung and prostate. Treatment of mouse squamous carcinomas in vivo with the chemotherapeutic cis -platin resulted in elevated expression of the genes that mark this cell population. Our data have allowed us to create a simplified model of multistage carcinogenesis that identifies distinct stem-cell states at different stages of tumor progression, thereby identifying networks involved in lineage plasticity, drug resistance, and immune surveillance, providing a rich source of potential targets for cancer therapy.

Owing to the large surface area of ZIF-8, DOX was successfully loaded into the ZIF-8/DOX-HA@MIP with a high drug loading efficiency (more than 88%). In vitro cell experiments have shown that the strengthened targeting ability of ZIF-8/DOX-HA@MIP to PCa cells was realized through the synergistic effect of HA and the molecularly imprinted membrane.

A noninvasive imaging strategy could provide us with useful information on EVs' distribution, accumulation and homing in vivo, and pharmacokinetics. In this study, the long half-life radionuclide iodine-124 (124I) was used to directly label umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs. The resulting probe, namely, 124I-MSC-EVs, was manufactured and ready to use within 1 min. 124I-labeled MSC-EVs had high radiochemical purity (RCP, >99.4%) and stable in 5% human serum album (HSA) with RCP > 95% for 96 h. We demonstrated efficient intracellular internalization of 124I-MSC-EVs in two prostate cancer cell lines (22RV1 and DU145 cell). The uptake rates of 124I-MSC-EVs in human prostate cancer cell lines 22RV1 and DU145 cells were 10.35 ± 0.78 and 2.56 ± 0.21 (AD%) at 4 h. The promising cellular data has prompted us to investigate the biodistribution and in vivo tracking capability of this isotope-based labeling technique in tumor bearing animals. Using positron emission tomography (PET) technology, we showed that the signal from intravenously injected 124I-MSC-EVs mainly accumulated in the heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney in healthy kun ming (KM) mice, and the biodistribution study was similar to the imaging results. In the 22RV1 xenograft model, 124I-MSC-EVs accumulated significantly in the tumor after administration, and with the optimal image acquired at 48 h postinjection, the maximum of standard uptake value (SUVmax) of the tumor was 3-fold higher than that of DU145. Taken together, the probe has a high application prospect in immuno-PET imaging of EVs. Our technique provides a powerful and convenient tool for understanding the biological behavior and pharmacokinetic characteristics of EVs in vivo and facilitates the acquirement of comprehensive and objective data for future clinical studies of EVs.""","""['Qian Guo', 'Chuanke Zhao', 'Xiangyu Gao', 'Lixin Ding', 'Pei Wang', ""Ya'nan Ren"", 'Xingguo Hou', 'Yuan Yao', 'Cheng Zhang', 'Xianteng Yang', 'Zhi Yang', 'Hua Zhu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Pharm""","""['Preclinical Characterization and In Vivo Imaging of 111In-Labeled Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles.', 'Biodistribution of Intra-Arterial and Intravenous Delivery of Human Umbilical Cord Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Derived Extracellular Vesicles in a Rat Model to Guide Delivery Strategies for Diabetes Therapies.', 'Mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles attenuate tPA-induced blood-brain barrier disruption in murine ischemic stroke models.', 'Extracellular vesicle-loaded hydrogels for tissue repair and regeneration.', 'Emerging strategies for labeling and tracking of extracellular vesicles.']"""

In both PET scans, uptake in normal organs (kidneys, spleen, liver, and salivary and lacrimal glands) was quantified. Repeatability was determined by using within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), with lower values indicating improved repeatability.

Recently, Tweedle and coworkers have developed an orthotopic canine prostate model allowing implanted tumors and therapeutic agents to be tested in a more translational large animal model. We used the canine model to evaluate prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted gold nanoparticles as a theranostic approach for fluorescence (FL) imaging and photodynamic therapy (PDT) of early stage prostate cancer.  Methods:   Dogs (four in total) were immunosuppressed with a cyclosporine-based immunosuppressant regimen and their prostate glands were injected with Ace-1-hPSMA cells using transabdominal ultrasound (US) guidance. Intraprostatic tumors grew in 4-5 weeks and were monitored by ultrasound (US). When tumors reached an appropriate size, dogs were injected intravenously (iv) with PSMA-targeted nano agents (AuNPs-Pc158) and underwent surgery 24 h later to expose the prostate tumors for FL imaging and PDT. Ex vivo FL imaging and histopathological studies were performed to confirm PDT efficacy.  Results:   All dogs had tumor growth in the prostate gland as revealed by US. Twenty-four hours after injection of PSMA-targeted nano agents (AuNPs-Pc158), the tumors were imaged using a Curadel FL imaging device. While normal prostate tissue had minimal fluorescent signal, the prostate tumors had significantly increased FL. PDT was activated by irradiating specific fluorescent tumor areas with laser light (672 nm). PDT bleached the FL signal, while fluorescent signals from the other unexposed tumor tissues were unaffected. Histological analysis of tumors and adjacent prostate revealed that PDT damaged the irradiated areas to a depth of 1-2 mms with the presence of necrosis, hemorrhage, secondary inflammation, and occasional focal thrombosis. The nonirradiated areas showed no visible damages by PDT.  Conclusion:   We have successfully established a PSMA-expressing canine orthotopic prostate tumor model and used the model to evaluate the PSMA-targeted nano agents (AuNPs-Pc158) in the application of FL imaging and PDT. It was demonstrated that the nano agents allowed visualization of the cancer cells and enabled their destruction when they were irradiated with a specific wavelength of light.""","""['Dong Luo', 'Xinning Wang', 'Gopalakrishnan Ramamurthy', 'Ethan Walker', 'Lifang Zhang', 'Aditi Shirke', 'Naraen G Naidu', 'Clemens Burda', 'Reena Shakya', 'Eric T Hostnik', 'Mathew Joseph', 'Lee Ponsky', 'Vladimir Ponomarev', 'Thomas J Rosol', 'Michael F Tweedle', 'James P Basilion']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Prostate""","""['Development of a novel castration-resistant orthotopic prostate cancer model in New Zealand White rabbit.', 'A PSMA-targeted theranostic agent for photodynamic therapy.', 'Development of an orthotopic canine prostate cancer model expressing human GRPr.', 'Quantum dot 800–prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody J591.', 'Quenched indocyanine green-anti-prostate-specific membrane antigen antibody J591.']"""

Artificial intelligence (AI) might provide robust and personalised ssEPE predictions to better inform nerve-sparing strategy during radical prostatectomy. We aimed to develop, externally validate, and perform an algorithmic audit of an AI-based Side-specific Extra-Prostatic Extension Risk Assessment tool (SEPERA).  Methods:   Each prostatic lobe was treated as an individual case such that each patient contributed two cases to the overall cohort. SEPERA was trained on 1022 cases from a community hospital network (Trillium Health Partners; Mississauga, ON, Canada) between 2010 and 2020. Subsequently, SEPERA was externally validated on 3914 cases across three academic centres: Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (Toronto, ON, Canada) from 2008 to 2020; L'Institut Mutualiste Montsouris (Paris, France) from 2010 to 2020; and Jules Bordet Institute (Brussels, Belgium) from 2015 to 2020. Model performance was characterised by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC), calibration, and net benefit. SEPERA was compared against contemporary nomograms (ie, Sayyid nomogram, Soeterik nomogram [non-MRI and MRI]), as well as a separate logistic regression model using the same variables included in SEPERA. An algorithmic audit was performed to assess model bias and identify common patient characteristics among predictive errors.  Findings:   Overall, 2468 patients comprising 4936 cases (ie, prostatic lobes) were included in this study. SEPERA was well calibrated and had the best performance across all validation cohorts (pooled AUROC of 0·77 [95% CI 0·75-0·78] and pooled AUPRC of 0·61 [0·58-0·63]). In patients with pathological ssEPE despite benign ipsilateral biopsies, SEPERA correctly predicted ssEPE in 72 (68%) of 106 cases compared with the other models (47 [44%] in the logistic regression model, none in the Sayyid model, 13 [12%] in the Soeterik non-MRI model, and five [5%] in the Soeterik MRI model). SEPERA had higher net benefit than the other models to predict ssEPE, enabling more patients to safely undergo nerve-sparing. In the algorithmic audit, no evidence of model bias was observed, with no significant difference in AUROC when stratified by race, biopsy year, age, biopsy type (systematic only vs systematic and MRI-targeted biopsy), biopsy location (academic vs community), and D'Amico risk group. According to the audit, the most common errors were false positives, particularly for older patients with high-risk disease. No aggressive tumours (ie, grade >2 or high-risk disease) were found among false negatives.

Prohibitin (PHB1) is a multifunctional chaperone/scaffold protein that is upregulated in various cancers and plays a pro-cancer role. FL3 is a synthetic flavagline drug that inhibits cancer cell proliferation by targeting PHB1. However, the biological functions of PHB1 in CRPC and the effect of FL3 on CRPC cells remain to be explored.  Methods:   Several public datasets were used to analyze the association between the expression level of PHB1 and PCa progression as well as outcome in PCa patients. The expression of PHB1 in human PCa specimens and PCa cell lines was examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), qRT-PCR, and Western blot. The biological roles of PHB1 in castration resistance and underlying mechanisms were investigated by gain/loss-of-function analyses. Next, in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to investigate the anti-cancer effects of FL3 on CRPC cells as well as the underlying mechanisms.  Results:   PHB1 expression was significantly upregulated in CRPC and was associated with poor prognosis. PHB1 promoted castration resistance of PCa cells under androgen deprivation condition. PHB1 is an androgen receptor (AR) suppressive gene, and androgen deprivation promoted the PHB1 expression and its nucleus-cytoplasmic translocation. FL3, alone or combined with the second-generation anti-androgen Enzalutamide (ENZ), suppressed CRPC cells especially ENZ-sensitive CRPC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we demonstrated that FL3 promoted trafficking of PHB1 from plasma membrane and mitochondria to nucleus, which in turn inhibited AR signaling as well as MAPK signaling, yet promoted apoptosis in CRPC cells.

Numerous studies have shown that Asiatic Acid (AA) has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. However, the effect of AA on prostate cancer metastasis is still unclear. This purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of AA on prostate cancer metastasis and to better understand its molecular mechanisms of action. Our results indicate that AA ≤ 30 μM did not influence cell viability and cell cycle distribution in PC3, 22Rv1 and DU145 cells. AA inhibited the migratory and invasive capabilities of three prostate cancer cells to be due to its effects on Snail, but did not have activity on Slug. We observed that AA inhibited the Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF-1) and ETS Like-1 (Elk-1) protein interaction and affected the complex's binding capacity to the Snail promoter region, ultimately blocking Snail transcription activity.

Moreover, knockdown of p38MAPK enhanced AA-suppressed protein levels of MZF-1, Elk-1, and Snail, suggesting that p38MAPK influences prostate cancer cell metastasis.

Method:   One hundred and twenty-four patients with prostate MR exams and MRF-based T1 and T2 maps of the prostatic apex, mid gland, and base were identified from our database and included. Regions of interest encompassing the right and left lobes of the PZ were drawn for each axial slice on the T2 map and copied to the T1 map. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. Kruskal-Wallis test was used for assessing differences between subgroups and the Spearman coefficient was used for assessing any correlations.  Results:   Mean T1 and T2 values were 1941 and 88 ms, respectively, for the whole-gland, 1884 and 83 ms for the apex, 1974 and 92 ms for the mid-gland, 1966 and 88 ms for the base. T1 values were weakly negatively correlated with PSA values, while T1 and T2 values were weakly positively correlated with prostate weight and moderately positively correlated with PZ width. Finally, patients with PI-RADS 1 scores had higher T1 and T2 values of the whole PZ, compared with those with scores 2-5.  Conclusion:   Mean T1 and T2 values of the background PZ of the whole gland were 1941 ± 313 and 88 ± 39 ms, respectively.

A series of novel thiohydantoin based AR antagonists with efficient degradation against AR were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Based on our previous SAR and further structural optimization, a tool molecule 26h was discovered with dual mechanisms including improved antagonistic activity and potent degradation (AR-fl and AR-V7). Moreover, 26h can also effectively block AR nuclear translocation and inhibit AR/AR-V7 heterodimerization, thereby inhibiting downstream gene transcription. Importantly, 26h displayed potent robust efficacy in LNCaP (TGI: 70.70%) and 22Rv1 (TGI: 78.89%) xenograft models.

Method:   We determined marker concentrations in blood from 173 men treated with radical prostatectomy and evidence of detectable levels of PSA in the blood (PSA ≥ 0.05) after surgery between 2014 and 2015 and at least 1 year after any adjuvant therapy. We used Cox regression to determine whether any marker was associated with metastasis using both univariate and multivariable models that included standard clinical predictors.  Results:   Overall, 42 patients had metastasis, with a median follow-up of 67 months among patients without an event. The levels of intact and free PSA and free-to-total PSA ratio were significantly associated with metastasis. Discrimination was highest for free PSA (c-index: 0.645) and free-to-total PSA ratio (0.625). Only free-to-total PSA ratio remained associated with overall metastasis (either regional or distant) after including standard clinical predictors (p = 0.025) and increased discrimination from 0.686 to 0.697. Similar results were found using distant metastasis as an outcome (p = 0.011; c-index increased from 0.658 to 0.723).  Conclusion:   Our results provide evidence that free-to-total PSA ratio can risk stratifying patients with evidence of detectable levels of PSA in blood after RP.

The median number of previous treatment lines was two; three or more lines accounted for 49%. Information on genotype-matched therapies was provided to 277 (63%). Genotype-matched clinical trials were ineligible because of an excess number of previous treatment lines or use of specific agents were found in 66 (15%) patients, with the highest proportion in breast and prostate cancers. Many patients met the exclusion criteria of one to two or more treatment lines across cancer types. In addition, previous use of specific agents was a frequent exclusion criterion for breast, prostate, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. The patients with tumor types with a low median number (two or fewer) of previous treatment lines, including most rare cancers, primary unknown cancers, and pancreatic cancers, had significantly fewer ineligible clinical trials.

This substudy aimed to investigate the interreader variability and intrareader reproducibility of visual assessments of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans using the VISION read criteria and evaluate the agreement between read results for this and the VISION study. Methods: In VISION, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were centrally read as inclusion cases if they had at least 1 PSMA-positive lesion and no PSMA-negative lesions that fulfilled the exclusion criteria. In this substudy, 125 PET/CT scans (75 inclusion and 50 exclusion cases) were randomly selected from VISION and retrospectively assessed by 3 independent central readers. A random subset of 20 cases (12 inclusion and 8 exclusion cases) was recoded for assessment of intrareader reproducibility. Classification of cases as inclusion or exclusion cases was based on the VISION read criteria. Overall interreader variability was assessed by Fleiss κ-statistics, and pairwise variability and intrareader reproducibility were assessed by Cohen κ-statistics. Results: For interreader variability, the readers agreed on 77% of cases (overall average agreement rate, 0.85; Fleiss κ, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.50-0.70]). The pairwise agreement rate was 0.82, 0.88, and 0.84, and the corresponding Cohen κ was 0.54 (95% CI, 0.38-0.71), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.52-0.83), and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.43-0.75), respectively.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 222 patients selected for radioguided surgery using [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT at different time points after injection (≤4 h and >15 h). In total, 386 prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET predetermined lesions were analyzed on SPECT/CT using a 4-point scale, and the results were compared between early and late imaging groups, with uni- and multivariate analyses performed including prostate-specific antigen, injected [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S activity, Gleason grade group, initial TNM stage, and, stratified by size, PSMA PET/CT-positive lymph nodes. PSMA PET/CT findings served as the standard of reference. Results: [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT had a significantly higher positivity rate for detecting lesions in the late than the early imaging group (79%, n = 140/178, vs. 27%, n = 12/44 [P < 0.05] on a patient basis; 60%, n = 195/324, vs. 21%, n = 13/62 [P < 0.05] on a lesion basis). Similar positivity rates were found when lesions were stratified by size. Multivariate analysis found that SUVmax on PSMA PET/CT and the uptake time of [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S were independent predictors for lesion detectability on SPECT/CT. Conclusion: Late imaging (>15 h after injection) should be preferred when [99mTc]Tc-PSMA-I&S SPECT/CT is used for lesion detection in early biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.

Five-year survival rates were estimated by applying relative survival approaches. We also applied the international cancer survival standard weights for age standardization. Finally, we calculated the excess hazard ratio (EHR) for each province adjusted for age, sex, and cancer sites to estimate the excess hazard ratio of mortality compared to the capital province (Tehran).  Results:   The largest gap in survival was observed in more curable cancer types, including melanoma (41.4%), ovary (32.3%), cervix (35.0%), prostate (26.7%), and rectum (21.4%), while the observed geographical disparity in lethal cancers such as lung, brain, stomach, and pancreas was less than 15%.

Materials and methods:   The unique cross-sequential design facilitates a comparison between the health changes in long-term (five years +) older cancer survivors (breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer) and demographically matched older adults without a history of cancer in the same geographic area within the same period. The study also captured comprehensive information on how socioeconomic status interacts with cancer and aging over time. General linear models were employed in the data analysis.  Results:   The findings showed that early cancer experience did not affect long-term cancer survivors' health status in later life. Conversely, comorbidities, being an African American, being female, and having education less than a college degree significantly decreased the health trajectory in later life for all older adults.

Resistance-based exercise programs are critical to counteract the musculoskeletal toxicities derived from prostate cancer treatment and aging. However, there is significant variability in the effects of exercise interventions. Examining demographic and clinical moderators of exercise effects in this patient group can assist in identifying which subgroups of patients benefit most. Therefore, we examined the effects and moderators of resistance-based exercise programs on sarcopenia-related outcomes that included lean mass, skeletal muscle index, physical function, and muscle strength in older men with prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   Data were retrieved from the Predicting OptimaL cAncer RehabIlitation and Supportive care (POLARIS) consortium. For the present study, we included data from trials that examined the effects of supervised resistance-based exercise interventions on lean mass outcomes, muscle strength, and physical function in patients with prostate cancer previously or currently treated with ADT. Linear mixed models were undertaken to analyse the effects of resistance-based exercise programs considering the clustering of patients within studies. Effects were evaluated by regressing the study group on the post-intervention value of the outcome adjusted for the baseline value, while potential moderators were examined by adding the moderator and its interaction term into the regression model.  Results:   A total of 560 patients with prostate cancer (age: 69.5 ± 7.8 yrs.; body mass index: 28.6 ± 4.0 kg.m-2) previously or currently treated with ADT were included. Resistance-based exercise programs resulted in significant effects on whole-body and appendicular lean mass and the skeletal muscle index (P < 0.05), with improvements observed across different characteristics. Improvements were also observed in 400-m walk and 6-m backwards tandem walk (P < 0.05), with patients presenting with lower baseline levels deriving greater exercise effects on 400-m walk (-19.4 s, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -36.6 to -2.3) and 6-m backwards tandem walk tests (-3.0 s, 95% CI: -5.7 to -0.3). For relative muscle strength, significant exercise effects were observed, with greater effects in younger patients (0.35 kg.kg-1, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.48).

Methods:   In five Goms (colon, ovary, lung, prostate, bladder) active in some Roc hospitals, the pre-Gom time elapsing between the date of diagnosis and the date of the first Gom meeting and the Gom time elapsing between the date of the first Gom meeting and the date of the treatment decision were measured. Gom times longer than 28 days were defined as high. The risk of high Gom time was analyzed with a Bart-type machine learning algorithm, considering the set of regressors (features) available to classify patients.  Results:   The results on the test set (54 patients) report an accuracy of 0.68. The classification technique reported a good fit for colon Gom (93%) and an over-classification for lung Gom. The study of the marginal effects showed a higher risk for those who had a previous therapeutic act and for lung Gom.  Conclusions:   Within the Goms took in consideration the proposed statistical technique showed that, depending on each Gom, correctly classified about 70% of individuals on risk of delaying permanence within the Roc. The ValPeRoc project evaluates Roc activity for the first time through a replicable analysis of patient pathway times from diagnosis to the act of treatment. Specifically, the times analyzed measure the quality of the regional health care system.""","""['Sergio Coluccia', 'Piergiacomo Di Gennaro', 'Anna Crispo', 'Maria Grimaldi', 'Flavia Nocerino', 'Egidio Celentano', 'Govanni Baglio', 'Anna Bastone', 'Giorgia Rivieccio', 'Francesco Schiavone', 'Attilio M Bianchi', ""Davide D'Errico"", 'Sandro Pignata', 'Elisabetta Coppola']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Recenti Prog Med""","""['New approach to implement cancer patient care: The valutazione percorso rete oncologica campana (ValPeROC)-experience from an Italian oncology network.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Italian cancer figures--Report 2015: The burden of rare cancers in Italy.', 'Volume and health outcomes: evidence from systematic reviews and from evaluation of Italian hospital data.', 'Mortality Atlas of the Campania Region.

The mainstay of treatment for advanced prostate cancer is targeting of androgen receptor signaling, including androgen deprivation therapy plus second-generation androgen receptor blockade (e.g., enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide), and/or androgen synthesis inhibition (abiraterone). While these agents have significantly prolonged the lives of patients with advanced prostate cancer, is nearly universal. This therapy resistance is mediated by diverse mechanisms, including both androgen receptor-dependent mechanisms, such as androgen receptor mutations, amplifications, alternative splicing, and amplification, as well as non-androgen receptor-mediated mechanisms, such as lineage plasticity toward neuroendocrine-like or epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like lineages. Our prior work identified the EMT transcriptional regulator Snail as critical to hormonal therapy resistance and is commonly detected in human metastatic prostate cancer. In the current study, we sought to interrogate the actionable landscape of EMT-mediated hormone therapy resistant prostate cancer to identify synthetic lethality and collateral sensitivity approaches to treating this aggressive, therapy-resistant disease state. Using a combination of high-throughput drug screens and multi-parameter phenotyping by confluence imaging, ATP production, and phenotypic plasticity reporters of EMT, we identified candidate synthetic lethalities to Snail-mediated EMT in prostate cancer. These analyses identified multiple actionable targets, such as XPO1, PI3K/mTOR, aurora kinases, c-MET, polo-like kinases, and JAK/STAT as synthetic lethalities in Snail+ prostate cancer. We validated these targets in a subsequent validation screen in an LNCaP-derived model of resistance to sequential androgen deprivation and enzalutamide. This follow-up screen provided validation of inhibitors of JAK/STAT and PI3K/mTOR as therapeutic vulnerabilities for both Snail+ and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Kathryn E Ware', 'Beatrice C Thomas', 'Pelumi D Olawuni', 'Maya U Sheth', 'Nathan Hawkey', 'M Yeshwanth', 'Brian C Miller', 'Katherine J Vietor', 'Mohit Kumar Jolly', 'So Young Kim', 'Andrew J Armstrong', 'Jason A Somarelli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Mol Biosci""","""['Emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory network links EMT and androgen receptor-dependent resistance in prostate cancer.', 'Cross-Resistance Among Next-Generation Antiandrogen Drugs Through the AKR1C3/AR-V7 Axis in Advanced Prostate Cancer.', 'Comparative efficacy of second-generation androgen receptor inhibitors for treating prostate cancer: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.', 'Snail promotes resistance to enzalutamide through regulation of androgen receptor activity in prostate cancer.', 'Second-Generation Antiandrogens: From Discovery to Standard of Care in Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer.']"""

These inverse associations may be explained by common flaws in observational analyses that can be avoided by explicitly emulating a target trial.  Methods:   We emulated target trials of metformin therapy and cancer risk using population-based linked electronic health records from the UK (2009-2016). We included individuals with diabetes, no history of cancer, no recent prescription for metformin or other glucose-lowering medication, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <64 mmol/mol (<8.0%). Outcomes included total cancer and 4 site-specific cancers (breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate). We estimated risks using pooled logistic regression with adjustment for risk factors via inverse-probability weighting. We emulated a second target trial among individuals regardless of diabetes status. We compared our estimates with those obtained using previously applied analytic approaches.  Results:   Among individuals with diabetes, the estimated 6-year risk differences (metformin - no metformin) were -0.2% (95% CI = -1.6%, 1.3%) in the intention-to-treat analysis and 0.0% (95% CI = -2.1%, 2.3%) in the per-protocol analysis. The corresponding estimates for all site-specific cancers were close to zero. Among individuals regardless of diabetes status, these estimates were also close to zero and more precise. By contrast, previous analytic approaches yielded estimates that appeared strongly protective.  Conclusions:   Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that metformin therapy does not meaningfully influence cancer incidence. The findings highlight the importance of explicitly emulating a target trial to reduce bias in the effect estimates derived from observational analyses.""","""['Barbra A Dickerman', 'Xabier García-Albéniz', 'Roger W Logan', 'Spiros Denaxas', 'Miguel A Hernán']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Epidemiology""","""['Avoidable flaws in observational analyses: an application to statins and cancer.', 'Emulating a target trial in case-control designs: an application to statins and colorectal cancer.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Selenium for preventing cancer.', 'Dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 analogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.']"""

We aimed to determine whether the interleukin-8 level in the tumor microenvironment could serve as a potential clinical diagnostic marker and prognostic factor for prostate cancer.  Methods:   The migration assay of prostate cancer cells was performed in an in vitro co-culture model. Cell lines PC3 and DU145 were divided into two groups and co-cultured with M0 and M2 macrophages, respectively. We used reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to detect M2 macrophage marker expression levels. Immunohistochemistry analyses of tissue microarrays were performed to analyze the correlation between the increased expression of interleukin-8 and the prognosis of prostate cancer. A retrospective analysis based on 142 residual serum specimens was performed to analyze the level of interleukin-8.  Results:   We observed that M2 macrophages promoted the migration of prostate cancer cells and significantly increased the concentrations of interleukin-8 in the co-culture supernatants. We observed increased expression of CD163 and interleukin-8 in prostate cancer tissues. Furthermore, the levels of interleukin-8 in the serum of prostate cancer patients were higher than those in healthy controls. Untreated patients had higher levels of interleukin-8, which could be a predictor of a higher metastasis rate.

Evidence of increased risk of cancer following such surgery is, however, inconclusive.  Methods:   We conducted a population-based, sibling-controlled cohort study of 4,953,583 individuals in Sweden with a follow-up during 1980-2016. History of tonsillectomy, adenotonsillectomy, and adenoidectomy was identified from the Swedish Patient Register whereas incident cases of cancer during follow-up were identified from the Swedish Cancer Register. We used Cox models to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of cancer in both a population and a sibling comparison. The sibling comparison was used to assess the potential impact of familial confounding, due to shared genetic or non-genetic factors within a family.  Results:   We found a modestly increased risk for any cancer following tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, or adenotonsillectomy in both the population (HR 1.10; 95%CI 1.07-1.12) and sibling (HR 1.15; 95%CI 1.10-1.20) comparisons. The association did not differ greatly by type of surgery, age at surgery, or potential indication for surgery, and persisted more than two decades after surgery. An excess risk was consistently observed for cancer of the breast, prostate, thyroid, and for lymphoma in both population and sibling comparisons. A positive association was observed for pancreatic cancer, kidney cancer, and leukemia in the population comparison whereas a positive association was observed for esophageal cancer in the sibling comparison.  Conclusions:   Surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids is associated with a modestly increased risk of cancer during the decades following the surgery.

The collected information is verified and made available to clinical researchers, physicians, and patients. When processing information, cancer registries verify that the patient-specific records they collect are plausible. This means that the collected information about a particular patient makes medical sense.  Methods:   Unsupervised machine learning approaches can detect implausible electronic health records without human guidance. Therefore, this article investigates two unsupervised anomaly detection approaches, a pattern-based approach (FindFPOF) and a compression-based approach (autoencoder), to identify implausible electronic health records in cancer registries. Unlike most existing work that analyzes synthetic anomalies, we compare the performance of both approaches and a baseline (random selection of records) on a real-world dataset. The dataset contains 21,104 electronic health records of patients with breast, colorectal, and prostate tumors. Each record consists of 16 categorical variables describing the disease, the patient, and the diagnostic procedure. The samples identified by FindFPOF, the autoencoder, and a random selection-a total of 785 different records-are evaluated in a real-world scenario by medical domain experts.  Results:   Both anomaly detection methods are good at detecting implausible electronic health records. First, domain experts identified [Formula: see text] of 300 randomly selected records as implausible. With FindFPOF and the autoencoder, [Formula: see text] of the proposed 300 records in each sample were implausible. This corresponds to a precision of [Formula: see text] for FindFPOF and the autoencoder. Second, for 300 randomly selected records that were labeled by domain experts, the sensitivity of the autoencoder was [Formula: see text] and the sensitivity of FindFPOF was [Formula: see text]. Both anomaly detection methods had a specificity of [Formula: see text]. Third, FindFPOF and the autoencoder suggested samples with a different distribution of values than the overall dataset. For example, both anomaly detection methods suggested a higher proportion of colorectal records, the tumor localization with the highest percentage of implausible records in a randomly selected sample.  Conclusions:   Unsupervised anomaly detection can significantly reduce the manual effort of domain experts to find implausible electronic health records in cancer registries. In our experiments, the manual effort was reduced by a factor of approximately 3.5 compared to evaluating a random sample.""","""['Philipp Röchner', 'Franz Rothlauf']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Med Res Methodol""","""['A clustering approach for detecting implausible observation values in electronic health records data.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Diagnostic Concordance of Telemedicine as Compared With Face-to-Face Care in Primary Health Care Clinics in Rural India: Randomized Crossover Trial.', 'Identifying prostate cancer and its clinical risk in asymptomatic men using machine learning of high dimensional peripheral blood flow cytometric natural killer cell subset phenotyping data.', 'Extracting information from the text of electronic medical records to improve case detection: a systematic review.']"""

We used a national database to assess insurance coverage of CaP biomarkers.  Materials and methods:   Insurance policies regarding 4K Score, ExoDx, My Prostate Score, Prostate Cancer Antigen 3, Prostate Health Index, and SelectMDx as of January 1, 2022 were extracted from the policy reporter database. Coverage was defined as a biomarker being deemed medically necessary, conditionally covered, or covered with prior authorization. Overall rates of biomarker coverage were compared by insurance type and region using Chi-squared test. SelectMDx was not covered by any queried policies and was omitted from analysis.  Results:   A total of 186 insurance plans were identified among 131 payers. Of the 186 plans, 109 (59%) covered at least one biomarker, with prior authorization required for 38 (35%) of these plans. Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 and 4K Score had higher rates of coverage compared to ExoDx, Prostate Health Index, and My Prostate Score (52% and 43% vs. 26%, 26%, and 5%, respectively, P < 0.01). Medicare plans had higher rates of coverage compared to non-Medicare plans (80% Medicare vs. 17% commercial, 15% federal employer, and 13% Medicaid, P < 0.01), and nationwide plans had higher coverage rates compared to regional plans (43% nationwide vs. 32% midwest, 27% northeast, 25% south, 24% west, P < 0.01). Covered biomarkers under Medicare plans were less likely to require prior authorization compared to those covered by non-Medicare plans (12% Medicare vs. 63% commercial, 100% federal employer, 70% Medicaid, P < 0.01).

In some centers the contemporary nondiagnostic renal mass biopsy rate may be as high as 22% and may be as high as 42% in challenging cases. Stimulated Raman Histology (SRH) is a novel microscopic technique which has created the possibility for rapid, label-free, high-resolution images of unprocessed tissue which may be viewed on standard radiology viewing platforms. The application of SRH to renal biopsy may provide the benefits of routine pathologic evaluation during the procedure, thereby reducing nondiagnostic results. We conducted a pilot feasibility study, to assess if renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtypes may be imaged and to see if high-quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) could subsequently be generated.  Methods/materials:   An 18-gauge core needle biopsy was taken from a series of 25 ex vivo radical or partial nephrectomy specimens. Histologic images of the fresh, unstained biopsy samples were obtained using a SRH microscope using 2 Raman shifts: 2,845 cm-1 and 2,930 cm-1. The cores were then processed as per routine pathologic protocols. The SRH images and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides were then viewed by a genitourinary pathologist.  Results:   The SRH microscope took 8 to 11 minutes to produce high-quality images of the renal biopsies. Total of 25 renal tumors including 1 oncocytoma, 3 chromophobe RCC, 16 clear cells RCC, 4 papillary RCC, and 1 medullary RCC were included. All renal tumor subtypes were captured, and the SRH images were easily differentiated from adjacent normal renal parenchyma. High quality H&E slides were produced from each of the renal biopsies after SRH was completed. Immunostains were performed on selected cases and the staining was not affected by the SRH image process.  Conclusion:   SRH produces high quality images of all renal cell subtypes that can be rapidly produced and easily interpreted to determine renal mass biopsy adequacy, and on occasion, may allow renal tumor subtype identification. Renal biopsies remained available to produce high quality H&E slides and immunostains for confirmation of diagnosis. Procedural application has promise to decrease the known rate of renal mass nondiagnostic biopsies, and application of convolutional neural network methodology may further improve diagnostic capability and increase utilization of renal mass biopsy among urologists.""","""['Miles P Mannas', 'Fang-Ming Deng', 'Eric C Belanger', 'Derek Jones', 'Joyce Ren', 'William Huang', 'Daniel A Orringer', 'Samir S Taneja']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Stimulated Raman histology, a novel method to allow for rapid pathologic examination of unprocessed, fresh prostate biopsies.', 'Toward digital histopathological assessment in surgery for central nervous system tumors using stimulated Raman histology.', 'Comparison of accuracy of 14-, 18- and 20-G needles in ex-vivo renal mass biopsy: a prospective, blinded study.', 'Label-free brain tumor imaging using Raman-based methods.', 'Primary collision tumors of the kidney composed of oncocytoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma: A review.']"""

The cancer registry reimburses the first notification of a tumour with €18. As the only provider, d-uo reimburses its members for the documentation effort associated with the additional notification to d-uo with a further €18. In addition to the basic oncological data set, further parameters were defined by d-uo. This data is collected, evaluated and interpreted as part of the VERSUS study. At the end of 2022, 14,834 patients with a newly diagnosed urological tumour were included in the VERSUS study. Almost two thirds of all patients had prostate cancer. About half of all patients with prostate cancer were diagnosed as part of an early detection measure. These patients then also had more favourable tumour stages. Overall, almost every eighth patient already had metastases at the time of initial diagnosis. Data from the VERSUS study are available for 2,167 operations on prostate cancer with tumour category T2 or T3.

Other milestones include the Federal Cancer Registry Data Act (2009), the Cancer Early Detection and Registry Act (2013), the Uniform Oncological Basic Data Set (2014/2021) with its modules (e.g. the module prostate carcinoma 2017) as well as the Cancer Registry Data Merger Act (2021). At the beginning of 2017, the German Society of Uro-Oncologists (d-uo) had the idea of designing a documentation platform that would enable d-uo members to report to the cancer registry and transfer data to d-uo's own database - without a double effort. The cancer registry reimburses the first notification of a tumour with € 18. As the only provider, d-uo reimburses its members for the documentation effort associated with the additional notification to d-uo with a further € 18. In addition to the basic oncological data set, further parameters were defined by d-uo. This data is collected, evaluated and interpreted as part of the VERSUS study. The realisation that the parameters of the basic data set are limited in their informative value led d-uo to establish the two national registries for urothelial carcinoma (UroNAT) and prostate carcinoma (ProNAT).

We tested the effect of papillary vs. chromophobe histological subtype, stage, and grade on 10-year cancer-specific survival, in patients eligible for ≥1 such trial.  Methods:   We identified patients meeting ASSURE, SORCE, EVEREST, PROSPER, or RAMPART trial inclusion criteria in the SEER (2000-2018) database. Kaplan-Meier analyses estimated 10-year survival rates and multivariable Cox regression models tested for the independent predictor status of histological subtype, stage, and grade.  Results:   We identified 5465 (68%) papillary and 2562 (32%) chromophobe renal cell carcinoma patients. Cancer-specific survival rates at 10 years were 77% in papillary vs. 90% in chromophobe. In multivariable Cox regression models applied to papillary patients, cancer-specific mortality independent predictor status was reached for T3G3-4 (HR 2.9), T4Gany (HR 3.4), TanyN1G1-2 (HR 3.1), and TanyN1G3-4 (HR 8.0, P<0.001), relative to T1/2Gany.

Conclusions:   In surgically treated non-metastatic intermediate/high-risk renal cell carcinoma patients, papillary histologic subtype exhibited worse cancer-specific survival than chromophobe histologic subtype.

Objective:   To develop and validate a nomogram for prediction of freedom from biochemical failure (FFBF) after PSMA-PET-based sRT.  Design, setting, and participants:   This retrospective cohort study included 1029 patients with prostate cancer treated between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2020, at 11 centers from 5 countries. The initial database consisted of 1221 patients. All patients had a PSMA-PET scan prior to sRT. Data were analyzed in November 2022.  Exposures:   Patients with a detectable post-radical prostatectomy prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level treated with sRT to the prostatic fossa with or without additional sRT to pelvic lymphatics or concurrent androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) were eligible.  Main outcomes and measures:   The FFBF rate was estimated, and a predictive nomogram was generated and validated. Biochemical relapse was defined as a PSA nadir of 0.2 ng/mL after sRT.  Results:   In the nomogram creation and validation process, 1029 patients (median age at sRT, 70 years [IQR, 64-74 years]) were included and further divided into a training set (n = 708), internal validation set (n = 271), and external outlier validation set (n = 50). The median follow-up was 32 months (IQR, 21-45 months). Based on the PSMA-PET scan prior to sRT, 437 patients (42.5%) had local recurrences and 313 patients (30.4%) had nodal recurrences. Pelvic lymphatics were electively irradiated for 395 patients (38.4%). All patients received sRT to the prostatic fossa: 103 (10.0%) received a dose of less than 66 Gy, 551 (53.5%) received a dose of 66 to 70 Gy, and 375 (36.5%) received a dose of more than 70 Gy.

Recent changes in recommendations for prostate cancer screening have been shown to decrease overall prostate cancer incidence and increase the likelihood of late stage disease. However, it is unclear how trends in prostate cancer characteristics among high risk Black men differ by geographic region during the changes in screening recommendations.  Methods:   In this study, we used population-based prostate cancer registry data to describe age-adjusted prostate cancer incidence trends from 2008 to 2015 among Black men from six geographic regions. We obtained data on incident Black prostate cancer patients from six cancer registries (in the United States: Florida, Alabama, Pennsylvania, and New York; and in the Caribbean: Guadeloupe and Martinique). After age standardization, we used descriptive analyses to compare the demographics and tumor characteristics by cancer registry site. The Joinpoint regression program was used to compare the trends in incidence by site.  Results:   A total of 59,246 men were analyzed. We found the highest incidence rates (per 100,000) for prostate cancer in the Caribbean countries (181.99 in Martinique and 176.62 in Guadeloupe) and New York state (178.74). Incidence trends decreased significantly over time at all sites except Martinique, which also showed significantly increasing rates of late stage (III/IV) and Gleason score 7+ tumors.

This study quantifies the energy utilization of proton therapy, corresponding carbon footprint, and discusses possible offsetting strategies towards carbon-neutral healthcare operations.  Materials/methods:   Patients treated between 07/2020 and 06/2021 using Mevion proton system were evaluated. Current measurements were converted to kilowatt (kW) power consumption. Patients were reviewed for disease, dose, number of fractions, and duration of beam. EPA calculator was used to convert power consumption to tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) for scope-based carbon footprint accounting.  Results:   There were 185 patients treated for total of 5,176 fractions delivered (average 28). Power consumption was 55.8 kW in standby/night mode and 64.4 kW during BeamOn, for annual total of 490 MWh. BeamOn time was 149.6 hours, and BeamOn consumption accounted for 2% of machine total. Power consumption was 52 kWh per patient (breast highest at 140 kWh, prostate lowest at 28 kWh). Annual power consumption of the administrative areas was ∼96 MWh, for a program total of 586 MWh. The carbon footprint for BeamOn time was 4.17 metric tons of CO2e, or 23 kg per patient course (breast cancer 60 kg, prostate 12 kg). Annual carbon footprint for the machine was 212.2 tons CO2e, and for the proton program 253.7 tons CO2e, with attributed footprint 1372 kg CO2e per patient. The corresponding CO2e offset for the program could be 4,192 new trees planted and grown for 10 years (23 trees per patient).  Conclusion:   Carbon footprint varied by disease treated and was on average 23 kg of CO2e per patient, and 253.7 tons of CO2e for the proton program.

The tumour microenvironment (TME) has been thought to play a crucial role in CRPC progression. Here, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on two CRPC and two hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC) samples to reveal potential leading roles in castration resistance. We described the single-cell transcriptional landscape of PCa. Higher cancer heterogeneity was explored in CRPC, with stronger cell cycling status and heavier copy number variant burden of luminal cells. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are one of the most critical components of TME, demonstrated unique expression and cell-cell communication features in CRPC. A CAFs subtype with high expression of HSD17B2 in CRPC was identified with inflammatory features. HSD17B2 catalyses the conversion of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone to their less active forms, which was associated with steroid hormone metabolism in PCa tumour cells. However, the characteristics of HSD17B2 in PCa fibroblasts remained unknown. We found that HSD17B2 knockdown in CRPC-CAFs could inhibit migration, invasion, and castration resistance of PCa cells in vitro. Further study showed that HSD17B2 could regulate CAFs functions and promote PCa migration through the AR/ITGBL1 axis. Overall, our study revealed the important role of CAFs in the formation of CRPC. HSD17B2 in CAFs regulated AR activation and subsequent ITGBL1 secretion to promote the malignant behaviour of PCa cells. HSD17B2 in CAFs could serve as a promising therapeutic target for CRPC.""","""['Yunyan Zhang', 'Aoyu Fan', 'Yunpeng Li', 'Zhuolin Liu', 'Liu Yu', 'Jianming Guo', 'Jun Hou', 'Xiaobo Li', 'Wei Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Lett""","""['Pre-existing Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer-like Cells in Primary Prostate Cancer Promote Resistance to Hormonal Therapy.', 'The ADAM9/UBN2/AKR1C3 axis promotes resistance to androgen-deprivation in prostate cancer.', 'Transcript Levels of Androgen Receptor Variant 7 and Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzyme 2C in Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

If a genetic component of risk could be modeled, this could potentially be the basis for modifying treatment for high-risk patients. We therefore investigated whether a previously developed machine learning-based modeling method using genome-wide common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can stratify patients in terms of the risk of radiation-induced hematuria.  Materials and methods:   We applied a two-step machine learning algorithm that we previously developed for genome-wide association studies called pre-conditioned random forest regression (PRFR). PRFR includes a pre-conditioning step, producing adjusted outcomes, followed by random forest regression modeling. Data was from germline genome-wide SNPs for 668 prostate cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. The cohort was stratified only once, at the outset of the modeling process, into two groups: a training set (2/3 of samples) for modeling and a validation set (1/3 of samples). Post-modeling bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify biological correlates plausibly associated with the risk of hematuria.  Results:   The PRFR method achieved significantly better predictive performance compared to other alternative methods (all p < 0.05). The odds ratio between the high and low risk groups, each of which consisted of 1/3 of samples in the validation set, was 2.87 (p = 0.029), implying a clinically useful level of discrimination. Bioinformatics analysis identified six key proteins encoded by CTNND2, GSK3B, KCNQ2, NEDD4L, PRKAA1, and TXNL1 genes as well as four statistically significant biological process networks previously shown to be associated with the bladder and urinary tract.  Conclusion:   The risk of hematuria is significantly dependent on common genetic variants. The PRFR algorithm resulted in a stratification of prostate cancer patients at differential risk levels of post-radiotherapy hematuria.

Therefore, our aim was to elucidate the uptake patterns of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in salivary gland tissue and cells by conducting cellular binding and autoradiography experiments. Briefly, A-253 and PC3-PIP cells, and mouse kidney and pig salivary gland tissue, were incubated with 5 nM [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 to characterize its binding. Additionally, [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 was co-incubated with monosodium glutamate, ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Low, non-specific binding was observed in salivary gland cells and tissues. Monosodium glutamate was able to decrease [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in PC3-PIP cells, mouse kidney and pig salivary gland tissue. Kynurenic acid (ionotropic antagonist) decreased the binding of [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 to 29.2 ± 20.6% and 63.4 ± 15.4%, respectively, with similar effects observed on tissues.

When present asymptomatically, the parasite can lead to serious complications, such as development of cervical and prostate cancer. As infection increases the acquisition and transmission of HIV, the control of trichomoniasis represents an important niche for the discovery and development of new antiparasitic molecules. This urogenital parasite synthesizes several molecules that allow the establishment and pathogenesis of infection. Among them, peptidases occupy key roles as virulence factors, and the inhibition of these enzymes has become an important mechanism for modulating pathogenesis. Based on these premises, our group recently reported the potent anti-T. vaginalis action of the metal-based complex [Cu(phendione)3](ClO4)2.4H2O (Cu-phendione). In the present study, we evaluated the influence of Cu-phendione on the modulation of proteolytic activities produced by T. vaginalis by biochemical and molecular approaches. Cu-phendione showed strong inhibitory potential against T. vaginalis peptidases, especially cysteine- and metallo-type peptidases. The latter revealed a more prominent effect at both the post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. Molecular Docking analysis confirmed the interaction of Cu-phendione, with high binding energy (-9.7 and -10.7 kcal·mol-1, respectively) at the active site of both TvMP50 and TvGP63 metallopeptidases. In addition, Cu-phendione significantly reduced trophozoite-mediated cytolysis in human vaginal (HMVII) and monkey kidney (VERO) epithelial cell lineages.

In this study, we evaluated a small library of PSMA-targeting derivatives with modified linker residues, and selected the best candidate based on its binding affinity to PSMA. The lead compound was coupled to a chelator for radiolabeling, and subject to dimerization. The resulting molecules, 22 and 30, were highly PSMA specific (IC50 = 1.0-1.6 nM) and stable when radiolabeled with indium-111 (>90% stable in PBS and mouse serum up to 24 h). Moreover, [111In]In-30 presented a high uptake in PSMA expressing LS174T cells, with 92.6% internalization compared to 34.1% for PSMA-617. Biodistribution studies in LS174T mice xenograft models showed that [111In]In-30 had a higher tumor and kidney uptake compared to [111In]In-PSMA-617, but increasing T/K and T/M ratios at 24 h p.i. Tumors could be clearly visualized at 1 h p.i. by SPECT/CT after administration of [111In]In-22 and [111In]In-PSMA-617, while [111In]In-30 showed a clear signal at later time-points (e.g., 24 h p.i.).""","""['Erika Murce', 'Savanne Beekman', 'Evelien Spaan', 'Maryana Handula', 'Debra Stuurman', 'Corrina de Ridder', 'Yann Seimbille']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Molecules""","""['Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Optimization of the Tissue Distribution Profile.', 'In Vitro and In Vivo Characterization of an 18F-AlF-Labeled PSMA Ligand for Imaging of PSMA-Expressing Xenografts.', 'Preclinical Evaluation of a Tailor-Made DOTA-Conjugated PSMA Inhibitor with Optimized Linker Moiety for Imaging and Endoradiotherapy of Prostate Cancer.', 'Full preclinical validation of the 123I-labeled anti-PSMA antibody fragment ScFvD2B for prostate cancer imaging.', 'The utility of radiolabeled PSMA ligands for tumor imaging.']"""

This study aims to present a single institution's experience with simultaneous IH repair (IHR) and robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 452 patients who underwent RARP between January 2018 and December 2020. A total of 73 patients had a concomitant IHR with a monofilament polypropylene mesh. Patients with bowel in the hernia sac or recurrent hernia were excluded. Results: The median age and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score were 67 years (inter-quartile range (IQR) 56-77) and 2 (IQR 1-3), respectively. The median prostate volume and preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were 38 mL (IQR 25.0-75.2) and 7.8 ng/mL (IQR 2.6-23.0), respectively. The surgery was successfully performed in all cases. The median overall and IHR operative time were 190.0 (IQR 140.0-230.0) and 32.5 (IQR 14.0-40.0) minutes, respectively. The median estimated blood loss and length of hospital stay were 100 mL (IQR 10-170) and 3 days (IQR 2-4), respectively. Only five (6.8%) minor complications occurred after surgery. At the 24-month follow-up, no cases of mesh infection, seroma formation, or groin pain were recorded.

Inevitably, all advanced PCa patients develop metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), an aggressive phase of the disease. Treating mCRPC is challenging, and prognostic tools are needed for disease management. MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation has been reported in PCa, constituting potential non-invasive prognostic biomarkers. As such, this study aimed to evaluate the prognostic potential of nine miRNAs in the liquid biopsies (plasma) of mCRPC patients treated with second-generation androgen receptor axis-targeted (ARAT) agents, abiraterone acetate (AbA) and enzalutamide (ENZ). Low expression levels of miR-16-5p and miR-145-5p in mCRPC patients treated with AbA were significantly associated with lower progression-free survival (PFS). The two miRNAs were the only predictors of the risk of disease progression in AbA-stratified analyses. Low miR-20a-5p levels in mCRPC patients with Gleason scores of <8 were associated with worse overall survival (OS). The transcript seems to predict the risk of death regardless of the ARAT agent. According to the in silico analyses, miR-16-5p, miR-145-5p, and miR-20a-5p seem to be implicated in several processes, namely, cell cycle, proliferation, migration, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism related to treatment outcome. These miRNAs may represent attractive prognostic tools to be used in mCRPC management, as well as a step further in the identification of new potential therapeutic targets, to use in combination with ARAT for an improved treatment outcome.

The prognostic utility of CTC enumeration using positive selection with the FDA-approved CellSearchTM system has been demonstrated in numerous studies. The capture of cells with specific protein phenotypes does not fully represent cancer heterogeneity and therefore does not realize the prognostic potential of CTC liquid biopsies. To avoid this selection bias, CTC enrichment based on size and deformability may provide better fidelity, i.e., facilitate the characterization of CTCs with any phenotype. In this study, the recently FDA-approved Parsortix® technology was used to enrich CTCs from prostate cancer (PCa) patients for transcriptome analysis using HyCEADTM technology.

TP53, RB1, or PTEN and upregulation of the homologous recombination repair genes at NEPC sites were not downregulated. Urothelial carcinoma markers were not elevated. Meanwhile, Rbfox3 and SFRTM2 levels were downregulated while the levels of the fibrosis markers HGF, HMOX1, ELN, and GREM1 were upregulated in the tumor microenvironment of NEPC.

However, whether the molecular mechanisms for tumor suppression are also involved in the calcium- and phospholipid-binding properties of ANXA7 remain to be elucidated. We hypothesized that the 4 C-terminal endonexin-fold repeats in ANXA7 (GX(X)GT), which are contained within each of the 4 annexin repeats with 70 amino acids, are responsible for both calcium- and GTP-dependent membrane fusion and the tumor suppressor function. Here, we identified a dominant-negative triple mutant (DNTM/DN-ANXA7J) that dramatically suppressed the ability of ANXA7 to fuse with artificial membranes while also inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and sensitizing cells to cell death. We also found that the [DNTM]ANA7 mutation altered the membrane fusion rate and the ability to bind calcium and phospholipids. In addition, in prostate cancer cells, our data revealed that variations in phosphatidylserine exposure, membrane permeabilization, and cellular apoptosis were associated with differential IP3 receptor expression and PI3K/AKT/mTOR modulation. In conclusion, we discovered a triple mutant of ANXA7, associated with calcium and phospholipid binding, which leads to the loss of several essential functions of ANXA7 pertinent to tumor protection and highlights the importance of the calcium signaling and membrane fusion functions of ANXA7 for preventing tumorigenesis.""","""['Meera Srivastava', 'Alakesh Bera', 'Ofer Eidelman', 'Minh B Tran', 'Catherine Jozwik', 'Mirta Glasman', 'Ximena Leighton', 'Hung Caohuy', 'Harvey B Pollard']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""['ANXA7-GTPase as Tumor Suppressor: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Opportunities.', 'Annexin-A7 protects normal prostate cells and induces distinct patterns of RB-associated cytotoxicity in androgen-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer cells.', 'Distinct effects of annexin A7 and p53 on arachidonate lipoxygenation in prostate cancer cells involve 5-lipoxygenase transcription.', 'Diverse effects of ANXA7 and p53 on LNCaP prostate cancer cells are associated with regulation of SGK1 transcription and phosphorylation of the SGK1 target FOXO3A.', 'The PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway and Prostate Cancer: At the Crossroads of AR, MAPK, and WNT Signaling.']"""

Although most PSMA-targeting ligands are radiopharmaceuticals used in imaging or radioligand therapy, this article evaluates a PSMA-targeting small molecule-drug conjugate, and, thus, addresses a hitherto little-explored field. PSMA binding affinity and cytotoxicity were determined in vitro using cell-based assays. Enzyme-specific cleavage of the active drug was quantified via an enzyme-based assay. Efficacy and tolerability in vivo were assessed using an LNCaP xenograft model. Histopathological characterization of the tumor in terms of apoptotic status and proliferation rate was carried out using caspase-3 and Ki67 staining. The binding affinity of the Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate was moderate, compared to the drug-free PSMA ligand. Cytotoxicity in vitro was in the nanomolar range. Both binding and cytotoxicity were found to be PSMA-specific. Additionally, complete MMAE release could be reached after incubation with cathepsin B. In vivo, the MMAE conjugate displayed good tolerability and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. Immunohistochemical and histological studies revealed the antitumor effect of MMAE.VC.SA.617, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and the enhancement of apoptosis.

In order to elaborate on these phenomena following a PCa diagnosis, we conducted focus group discussions with GB men in relationships. Men were recruited nationally through PCa support groups, and after completing consent procedures, they were invited to one of two focus group discussions conducted through video conference. Topics discussed included the diagnosis and medical decision making pertaining to PCa; healthcare provider experiences; the emotional, physical, and sexual impact of PCa diagnosis and treatment; sources of support and appraisal of resources; and partner involvement and communication. There were twelve GB men who participated in focus group discussions that were audio-recorded and transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic approach. GB couple experiences with PCa during and after treatment choice and recovery identified common patient-provider communication barriers. In particular, GB men reported difficulties in disclosing their sexuality and relationship to their providers, limiting conversations about treatment choice and partner engagement in care. Both patients and partners experienced times of being alone after treatment, either by choice or to give space to their partner. However, partners often did not explicitly discuss their preferences for being alone or together, which resulted in partners' disengagement in their relationship and the prostate cancer healthcare process.

Clinical and genomic data of 500 PCa cases from the Cancer Genome Atlas stable were retrieved from the Genomic Data Commons and cBioPortal databases. The CNA statuses of a total of 52 genetic markers, including 21 novel markers and 31 previously identified potential prognostic markers, were tested for prognostic significance. The CNA statuses of a total of 51/52 genetic markers were significantly associated with advanced disease at an odds ratio threshold of ≥1.5 or ≤0.667.

A Cox Regression analysis showed that the amplification of MIR602 and deletions of MIR602, ZNF267, MROH1, PARP8, and HCN1 correlated with a progression-free survival independent of the disease stage and Gleason prognostic group grade.

Previous studies documented the role of autophagy in sex steroid hormone biosynthesis in different animal models and human testis. Here we demonstrate in this study that sex steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone are produced through the same autophagy-mediated mechanism in the human ovary in addition to the human testis. In brief, pharmacological inhibition and genetic interruption of autophagy through silencing of autophagy genes (Beclin1 and ATG5) via siRNA and shRNA technologies significantly reduced basal and gonadotropin-stimulated estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4) and testosterone (T) production in the ex vivo explant tissue culture of ovary and testis and primary and immortalized granulosa cells. Consistent with the findings of the previous works, we observed that lipophagy, a special form of autophagy, mediates the association of the lipid droplets (LD)s with lysosome to deliver the lipid cargo within the LDs to lysosomes for degradation in order to release free cholesterol required for steroid synthesis. Gonadotropin hormones are likely to augment the production of sex steroid hormones by upregulating the expression of autophagy genes, accelerating autophagic flux and promoting the association of LDs with autophagosome and lysosome. Moreover, we detected some aberrations at different steps of lipophagy-mediated P4 production in the luteinized GCs of women with defective ovarian luteal function. The progression of autophagy and the fusion of the LDs with lysosome are markedly defective, along with reduced P4 production in these patients. Our data, together with the findings of the previous works, may have significant clinical implications by opening a new avenue in understanding and treatment of a wide range of diseases, from reproductive disorders to sex steroid-producing neoplasms, sex steroid-dependent malignancies (breast, endometrium, prostate) and benign disorders (endometriosis).""","""['Yashar Esmaeilian#', 'Francesko Hela#', 'Gamze Bildik#', 'Ece İltumur', 'Sevgi Yusufoglu', 'Ceren Sultan Yildiz', 'Kayhan Yakin', 'Yakup Kordan', 'Ozgur Oktem']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""['Ex vivo and in vitro testis and ovary explants: utility for identifying steroid biosynthesis inhibitors and comparison to a Tier I screening battery.', 'Identification of novel lipid droplet factors that regulate lipophagy and cholesterol efflux in macrophage foam cells.', 'Lipophagy maintains energy homeostasis in the kidney proximal tubule during prolonged starvation.', 'Autophagy and Lipid Metabolism.', 'Lipid Droplets and Their Autophagic Turnover via the Raft-Like Vacuolar Microdomains.', 'Editorial: Molecular and cytogenetic research advances in human reproduction - volume II.']"""

The primary goal during pretreatment evaluation of prostate cancer is disease detection, localization, establishing disease extent (both local and distant), and evaluating aggressiveness, which are the driving factors of patient outcomes such as recurrence and survival. Prostate cancer is typically diagnosed after the recognizing elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level or abnormal digital rectal examination. Tissue diagnosis is obtained by transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy or MRI-targeted biopsy, commonly with multiparametric MRI without or with intravenous contrast, which has recently been established as standard of care for detecting, localizing, and assessing local extent of prostate cancer. Although bone scintigraphy and CT are still typically used to detect bone and nodal metastases in patients with intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer, novel advanced imaging modalities including prostatespecific membrane antigen PET/CT and whole-body MRI are being more frequently utilized for this purpose with improved detection rates. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios.

Therefore, we sought to characterise the genomic landscape, comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) utilisation patterns, and treatment patterns across ancestries in a large, diverse, advanced prostate cancer cohort, to determine the impact of genomics on ancestral disparities.  Methods:   In this large-scale retrospective analysis, the CGP-based genomic landscape was evaluated in biopsy sections from 11 741 patients with prostate cancer, with ancestry inferred using a single nucleotide polymorphism-based approach. Admixture-derived ancestry fractions for each patient were also interrogated. Independently, clinical and treatment information was retrospectively reviewed for 1234 patients in a de-identified US-based clinicogenomic database. Prevalence of gene alterations, including actionable gene alterations, was assessed across ancestries (n=11 741). Furthermore, real-world treatment patterns and overall survival was assessed in the subset of patients with linked clincogenomic information (n=1234).  Findings:   The CGP cohort included 1422 (12%) men of African ancestry and 9244 (79%) men of European ancestry; the clinicogenomic database cohort included 130 (11%) men of African ancestry and 1017 (82%) men of European ancestry. Men of African ancestry received more lines of therapy before CGP than men of European ancestry (median of two lines [IQR 0-8] vs one line [0-10], p=0·029). In genomic analyses, ancestry-specific mutational landscapes were observed, but the prevalence of alterations in AR, the DNA damage response pathway, and other actionable genes were similar across ancestries. Similar genomic landscapes were observed in analyses that accounted for admixture-derived ancestry fractions. After undergoing CGP, men of African ancestry were less likely to receive a clinical study drug compared with men of European ancestry (12 [10%] of 118 vs 246 [26%] of 938, p=0·0005).  Interpretation:   Similar rates of gene alterations with therapy implications suggest that differences in actionable genes (including AR and DNA damage response pathway genes) might not be a main driver of disparities across ancestries in advanced prostate cancer. Later CGP utilisation and a lower rate of clinical trial enrolment observed in men of African ancestry could affect genomics, outcomes, and disparities.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important role in PCa development, which consists of tumor cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and extracellular matrix (ECM). Hyaluronic acid (HA) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are the major components in the TME and are correlated with PCa proliferation and metastasis, while the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood due to the lack of biomimetic ECM components and coculture models. In this study, gelatin methacryloyl/chondroitin sulfate-based hydrogels were physically crosslinked with HA to develop a novel bioink for the three-dimensional bioprinting of a coculture model that can be used to investigate the effect of HA on PCa behaviors and the mechanism underlying PCa-fibroblasts interaction. PCa cells demonstrated distinct transcriptional profiles under HA stimulation, where cytokine secretion, angiogenesis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition were significantly upregulated. Further coculture of PCa with normal fibroblasts activated CAF transformation, which could be induced by the upregulated cytokine secretion of PCa cells. These results suggested HA could not only promote PCa metastasis individually but also induce PCa cells to activate CAF transformation and form HA-CAF coupling effects to further promote PCa drug resistance and metastasis.""","""['Kailei Xu', 'Yuye Huang', 'Miaoben Wu', 'Jun Yin', 'Peng Wei']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biofabrication""","""['Loss of exosomal miR-146a-5p from cancer-associated fibroblasts after androgen deprivation therapy contributes to prostate cancer metastasis.', 'YAP1-TEAD1 mediates the perineural invasion of prostate cancer cells induced by cancer-associated fibroblasts.', 'SOX9 in prostate cancer is upregulated by cancer-associated fibroblasts to promote tumor progression through HGF/c-Met-FRA1 signaling.', 'Crosstalk between cancer-associated fibroblasts and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment: new findings and future perspectives.', 'Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts in Conversation with Tumor Cells in Endometrial Cancers: A Partner in Crime.']"""

Objectives:   We aimed to investigate and isolate cytotoxic compounds with selective antitumor effects from the leaves of Z. spina-christi using bioassay-guided fractionation of methanol extract.  Methods:   Powdered, dried leaves were subjected to methanol extraction and fractionated using n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. Fractions with positive cytotoxicity against HeLa and THP-1 cell lines were further fractionated and eluted using various concentrations of organic solvents. Active compounds were isolated using different chromatographic methods and their chemical structures were determined using extensive spectroscopic methods, such as 1D NMR (1H NMR, 13C NMR, and DEPT), 2D NMR (COSY, HMBC, and HMQC), HRFAB-MS, and IR. Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects of the isolated compounds were evaluated against 62 tumor cell lines (including HeLa and THP-1) in addition to normal bone marrow cells.  Results:   The chloroform and aqueous methanol fractions of the leaves showed cytotoxic activity. Two compounds were successfully isolated and named ""sidrin"" (13-β-hydroxy-lup-20(30)-ene-2,3-β-epoxy-28-carboxylate) and ""sidroside"" (3-O-β-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-3)-α-L-arabinopyranosyl-jujubogenin-20-O-α-L-rhamnopyranoside). Sidrin exhibited cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia (Hl-60, RPMI-8226), lung cancer (A549, EKVX), breast cancer (BT-549, MDA-MB-231/ATCC), colon cancer (KM12), melanoma (M14, SK-MEL-5), and central nervous system (CNS) cancer (SF-295) cell lines, and selectivity was observed against the Hl-60, EKVX, BT-549, KM12, and SF-295 cell lines. In addition, sidrin was more active than sidroside and doxorubicin against the Hl-60 and EKVX cell lines. In contrast, sidrin had a similar effect to doxorubicin against the BT-549 and renal cancer (UO-31) cell lines. Sidroside was more selective against the leukemia (CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4), lung cancer (HOP-92, NCI-H322M), breast cancer (MDA-MB-468), melanoma (LOX IMVI), CNS cancer (SNB-19), ovarian cancer (OVCAR-8), renal cancer (UO-31, RXF 393), and prostate cancer (PC-3) cell lines. Both compounds exhibited similar activity against the breast cancer (MDA-MB-231, T-47D), colon cancer (HCC-2998, HCT-116), ovarian cancer (OVCAR-3), renal cancer (UO-31, 786-0, and SN 12C) cell lines.

A total of 11.1% had late Grade ≥ 2 GU toxicities and 7.6% had late Grade ≥ 2 GI toxicities. Two (1.4%) patients suffered from late Grade 3 GU toxicities. Similarly, two (1.4%) patients suffered from late Grade 3 GI toxicities. Acute GU and GI events correlated with prostate volume and dose to the hottest 10 cc volume (D10cc)/volumes receiving a minimum of 30 Gy (V30 Gy) of rectum, respectively. Late GI toxicity, frequency, and rectal hemorrhage correlated with rectal D0.1 cc/D1 cc, maximum dose to the bladder, and rectal D0.1 cc, respectively. Toxicities after prostate SBRT using 32-36 Gy/4 fractions were acceptable.

Positive family history, hypertension, diabetes, and obesity have also been associated with the risk of developing PCa. We aim to identify predictors of the prostate cancer detection rate (CDR) in a series of patients undergoing a fusion biopsy.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated 736 consecutive patients who underwent an elastic fusion biopsy from 2020 to 2022. Targeted biopsies (2-4 cores per MRI target) were followed by systematic mapping (10-12 cores). Clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was defined as ISUP score ≥ 2. Uni- and multi-variable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of CDR among age, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, positive family history, PSA, a positive digital rectal examination (DRE), PSA density ≥ 0.15, previous negative biopsy status, PI-RADS score, and size of MRI lesion.  Results:   The median patients' age was 71 years, and median PSA was 6.6 ng/mL. A total of 20% of patients had a positive digital rectal examination. Suspicious lesions in mpMRI were scored as 3, 4, and 5 in 14.9%, 55.0%, and 17.5% of cases, respectively. The CDR was 63.2% for all cancers and 58.7% for csPCa. Only age (OR 1.04, p < 0.001), a positive DRE (OR 1.75, p = 0.04), PSA density (OR 2.68, p < 0.001), and elevated PI-RADS score (OR 4.02, p = 0.003) were significant predictors of the CDR in the multivariable analysis for overall PCa. The same associations were found for csPCa. The size of an MRI lesion was associated with the CDR only in uni-variable analysis (OR 1.07, p < 0.001). BMI, hypertension, diabetes, and a positive family history were not predictors of PCa.  Conclusions:   In a series of patients selected for a fusion biopsy, positive family history, hypertension, diabetes, or BMI are not predictors of PCa detection.

Annexin-V/PI staining was used to measure the rate of apoptosis. DNA cell cycle was analysed by PI staining method. Real-time PCR was performed to assess mRNA levels of OPN isoforms, VEGF isoforms, P53 and KLK2. Migration potential, proliferative capability and nucleus morphology of cells were evaluated by the scratch-wound assay, colony-forming assay and Hoechst staining, respectively. Quercetin significantly increased the apoptosis rate of PC-3 and LNCaP cell lines, arrested the cell cycle at the sub-G1/G1 phase, and reduced the migration potential and colony-forming capability. Moreover, upregulation of apoptosis-related genes and downregulation of genes involved in proliferation and angiogenesis was also observed. Although our results elucidated that quercetin has antitumor effects on PC-3 and LNCaP, for the first time, we showed that quercetin treatment causes alterations in the expression of OPN and VEGF isoforms, which are cancer-promoting modulators through various processes such as angiogenesis and drug-resistance.

Under this paradigm, interobserver variance is high, with ISUP grades not correlating well with outcome for individual patients, and this contributes to the over- and undertreatment of patients. Recent studies have demonstrated improved prognostication of prostate cancer outcomes based on computational analyses of glands and nuclei within 2D whole slide images. Our group has also shown that the computational analysis of three-dimensional (3D) glandular features, extracted from 3D pathology datasets of whole intact biopsies, can allow for improved recurrence prediction compared to corresponding 2D features. Here we seek to expand on these prior studies by exploring the prognostic value of 3D shape-based nuclear features in prostate cancer (e.g. nuclear size, sphericity). 3D pathology datasets were generated using open-top light-sheet (OTLS) microscopy of 102 cancer-containing biopsies extracted ex vivo from the prostatectomy specimens of 46 patients. A deep learning-based workflow was developed for 3D nuclear segmentation within the glandular epithelium versus stromal regions of the biopsies. 3D shape-based nuclear features were extracted, and a nested cross-validation scheme was used to train a supervised machine classifier based on 5-year biochemical recurrence (BCR) outcomes. Nuclear features of the glandular epithelium were found to be more prognostic than stromal cell nuclear features (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.72 versus 0.63). 3D shape-based nuclear features of the glandular epithelium were also more strongly associated with the risk of BCR than analogous 2D features (AUC = 0.72 versus 0.62).

Methods and materials:   Data including 341 CBCTs (209 daily, 132 weekly) and 23 planning CTs from 23 patients was retrospectively analyzed. Anatomical deformation during treatment was estimated using free-form deformation (FFD) method from Elastix and DL-based VoxelMorph approaches. The VoxelMorph method was investigated using anatomical scans (VMorph_Sc) or label images (VMorph_Msk), or the combination of both (VMorph_Sc_Msk). Accumulated doses were compared with the planning dose.  Results:   The DSC ranges, averaged for prostate, rectum and bladder, were 0.60-0.71, 0.67-0.79, 0.93-0.98, and 0.89-0.96 for the FFD, VMorph_Sc, VMorph_Msk, and VMorph_Sc_Msk methods, respectively. When including both anatomical and label images, VoxelMorph estimated more complex deformations resulting in heterogeneous determinant of Jacobian and higher percentage of deformation vector field (DVF) folding (up to a mean value of 1.90% in the prostate). Large differences were observed between DL-based methods regarding estimation of the accumulated dose, showing systematic overdosage and underdosage of the bladder and rectum, respectively. The difference between planned mean dose and accumulated mean dose with VMorph_Sc_Msk reached a median value of +6.3 Gy for the bladder and -5.1 Gy for the rectum.  Conclusion:   The estimation of the deformations using DL-based approach is feasible for male pelvic anatomy but requires the inclusion of anatomical contours to improve organ correspondence.

In the present study, we explored the effect of a kind of rsRNA-28S, which originates from 28S rRNA, on the chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells and the mechanisms underlying its effect.  Methods:   Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify rsRNA-28S levels in serum samples taken from prostate cancer patients. DU-145R cells, which are resistant to both paclitaxel and docetaxel, were generated from parental DU-145 cells. Northern blot was conducted to detect cellular rsRNA-28S levels following drug treatments. To verify the effect of rsRNAs-28S on chemoresistance, antisense oligonucleotides were utilized to block rsRNA-28S functions, and a series of assays were further performed, such as cell viability, cell proliferation, colony formation and tumor sphere formation. The target gene of rsRNA-28S was explored using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.  Results:   The rsRNA-28S level was reduced in the serum samples of patients who received chemotherapy compared to that of patients who did not. Furthermore, the rsRNA-28S level was remarkably declined in DU-145R cells, and drug treatments decreased the levels of rsRNA-28S in DU-145 and DU-145R cells. Moreover, rsRNA-28S inhibition enhanced the chemoresistance of prostate cancer cells as well as their cancer stem cell characteristics. Mechanistically, the prostaglandin I2 synthase (PTGIS) gene transcript was verified as a target of rsRNA-28S, as rsRNA-28S inhibited the translation of PTGIS mRNA by directly binding the 3' untranslated region of PTGIS mRNA. rsRNA-28S inhibition was also found to increase PTGIS abundance, and PTGIS overexpression significantly enhanced prostate cancer cell chemoresistance.  Conclusions:   Our findings indicate that rsRNA-28S attenuates prostate cancer cell chemoresistance by downregulating its target gene PTGIS.

Currently, no blood-based biomarkers are present that bridges the crosstalk between PRAD and OM progression. Conversely, circulatory microRNAs (miRNAs) are gaining interest among the scientific community for its potential as blood-based markers for cancer detection. Using computational pipeline, this study screened exosome-based miRNA that is functionally regulating OM in PRAD. We retrieved the expression profile of miRNA, mRNA from PRAD microarray, and RNA-Seq samples deposited in global repositories and identified the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes. Thereafter, the average expression of the miRNAs was identified in extracellular vesicle specifically in exosomes. Survival analysis and clinical profiling identified functionally significant miR-92a-3p to be a key factor in OM. This was further examined by the interactions with various noncoding RNA elements, transcription factors, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and protein kinases regulated by miR-92a-3p. Identifying the expression pattern, nodal metastasis, Gleason score, and hazard ratio deciphered the critical role of the targets regulated by miR-92a-3p. Further, binding association analyzed through energy, seed match and accessibility showed the miRNA-targets involved in cytokine, TGF-β, and Wnt signaling having close regulatory role in promoting OM.

Increasing evidence that MIDs can vary by scale, direction of change, cancer type and estimation method has raised doubt about a single global standard. This paper identifies MID patterns for interpreting group-level change in EORTC QLQ-C30 scores across nine cancer types.  Methods:   Data were obtained from 21 published EORTC Phase III trials that enroled 13,015 patients across nine cancer types (brain, colorectal, advanced breast, head/neck, lung, mesothelioma, melanoma, ovarian, and prostate). Anchor-based MIDs for within-group change and between-group differences in change over time were obtained via mean change method and linear regression, respectively. Separate MIDs were estimated for improvements and deteriorations. Distribution-based estimates were derived and compared with anchor-based MIDs.  Results:   Anchor-based MIDs mostly ranged from 5 to 10 points. Differences in MIDs for improvement vs deterioration, for both within-group and between-group, were mostly within a 2-points range. Larger differences between within-group and between-group MIDs were observed for several scales in ovarian, lung and head/neck cancer. Most anchor-based MIDs ranged between 0.3 SD and 0.5 SD distribution-based estimates.  Conclusions:   Our results reinforce recent claims that no single MID can be applied to all EORTC QLQ-C30 scales and disease settings. MIDs varied by scale, improvement/deterioration, within/between comparisons and by cancer type. Researchers applying commonly used rules of thumb must be aware of the risk of dismissing changes that are clinically meaningful or underpowering analyses when smaller MIDs apply.""","""['Jammbe Z Musoro', 'Corneel Coens', 'Mirjam A G Sprangers', 'Yvonne Brandberg', 'Mogens Groenvold', 'Hans-Henning Flechtner', 'Kim Cocks', 'Galina Velikova', 'Linda Dirven', 'Elfriede Greimel', 'Susanne Singer', 'Katarzyna Pogoda', 'Eva M Gamper', 'Samantha C Sodergren', 'Alexander Eggermont', 'Michael Koller', 'Jaap C Reijneveld', 'Martin J B Taphoorn', 'Madeleine T King', 'Andrew Bottomley;EORTC Melanoma', ' Breast', ' Head and Neck', ' Genito-urinary', ' Gynecological', ' Gastro-intestinal', ' Brain', ' Lung and Quality of Life Groups']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Cancer""","""['Minimally important differences for interpreting European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life Questionnaire core 30 scores in patients with ovarian cancer.', 'Minimally important differences of EORTC QLQ-C30 scales in patients with lung cancer or malignant pleural mesothelioma - Interpretation guidance derived from two randomized EORTC trials.', 'Establishing anchor-based minimally important differences for the EORTC QLQ-C30 in glioma patients.', 'Minimally important difference estimates and methods: a protocol.', 'The EORTC QLQ-C30 Summary Score as Prognostic Factor for Survival of Patients with Cancer in the ""Real-World"": Results from the Population-Based PROFILES Registry.']"""

SCA suppressed cell viability and progression and induced apoptosis in PCa cells. SCA inhibited the expression of lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis related key genes. Through inhibition of these metabolic genes, SCA decreased the levels of fatty acids, lipid droplets and cholesterols in PCa cells. Moreover, SCA enhanced the expression of antioxidant factors, including Nrf2, HO-1, catalase and SOD-1, and reduced the ROS levels in PCa cells.

Methods:   A set of 4512 men were identified who underwent RP in Western Australia (WA) from March 2000 to December 2016 and had complete long-term follow-up. The t-test, Pearson chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test were used to evaluate differences between the transition zone (TZ) and peripheral/central zone (PZ/CZ) cancer. Univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to assess parameters on PSA failure and early treatment.  Results:   The positive BN margin rate for TZ cancer fell significantly over the study period. However, BN margin rates increased for PZ/CZ cancer over the time. Data of 4512 patients with median follow-up of 9.1 years confirmed that the high-risk TZ tumours with negative margins had a significant lower rate of PSA failure or early treatment compared to those high-risk PZ/CZ tumours with negative margins.  Conclusion:   Prostate cancer zonal origin significantly impacts long-term biochemical outcomes in high-risk and margin-negative patients. BN invasion with margin involvement is more frequent in the TZ cancer and can be reduced by pre-operative identification of cancer zonal origin and adjustment of surgical procedures.""","""['Laura Luttrell', 'Jian Li', 'Ronald J Cohen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int Urol Nephrol""","""['Prostate carcinoma with positive margins at radical prostatectomy: role of tumour zonal origin in biochemical recurrence.', 'The Impact of Prostate Cancer Zonal Origin on Pathological Parameters at Radical Prostatectomy and Subsequent Biochemical Failure.', 'Zonal origin of localized prostate cancer does not affect the rate of biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'The prognostic value of zonal origin and extraprostatic extension of prostate cancer for biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.', 'Impact of Zone of Origin in Anterior Dominant Prostate Cancer: Long-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in an Anatomically Well-Characterized Cohort.']"""

HERVs are suitable therapeutic targets due to their abundance in the human genome, overexpression in various malignancies, and involvement in various cancer pathways. We identified articles on HERVs from PubMed and then prescreened and automatically categorized them using the portable document format (PDF) data extractor (PDE) R package. We discovered 196 primary research articles with HERV expression data from cancer tissues or cancer cell lines. HERV RNA and protein expression was reported in brain, breast, cervical, colorectal, endocrine, gastrointestinal, kidney/renal/pelvis, liver, lung, genital, oral cavity, pharynx, ovary, pancreas, prostate, skin, testicular, urinary/bladder, and uterus cancers, leukemias, lymphomas, and myelomas. Additionally, we discovered reports of HERV RNA-only overexpression in soft tissue cancers including heart, thyroid, bone, and joint cancers. The CancerHERVdb database is hosted in the form of interactive visualizations of the expression data and a summary data table at https://erikstricker.shinyapps.io/cancerHERVdb/. The user can filter the findings according to cancer type, HERV family, HERV gene, or a combination thereof and easily export the results with the corresponding reference list. In our report, we provide examples of potential uses of the CancerHERVdb, such as identification of cancers suitable for off-target treatment with the multiple sclerosis-associated retrovirus (MSRV)-Env-targeting antibody GNbAC1 (now named temelimab) currently in phase 2b clinical trials for multiple sclerosis or the discovery of cancers overexpressing HERV-H long terminal repeat-associating 2 (HHLA2), a newly emerging immune checkpoint. In summary, the CancerHERVdb allows cross-study comparisons, encourages data exploration, and informs about potential off-target effects of HERV-targeting treatments. IMPORTANCE Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which in the past have inserted themselves in various regions of the human genome, are to various degrees activated in virtually every cancer type. While a centralized naming system and resources summarizing HERV levels in cancers are lacking, the CancerHERVdb database provides a consolidated resource for cross-study comparisons, data exploration, and targeted searches of HERV activation. The user can access data extracted from hundreds of articles spanning 25 human cancer categories. Therefore, the CancerHERVdb database can aid in the identification of prognostic and risk markers, drivers of cancer, tumor-specific targets, multicancer spanning signals, and targets for immune therapies. Consequently, the CancerHERVdb database is of direct relevance for clinical as well as basic research.""","""['Erik Stricker', 'Erin C Peckham-Gregory', 'Michael E Scheurer']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Virol""","""['HERVs and Cancer-A Comprehensive Review of the Relationship of Human Endogenous Retroviruses and Human Cancers.', 'Preclinical and early clinical development of GNbAC1, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody targeting endogenous retroviral MSRV-Env protein.', 'Expression profiles of human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K and HERV-R Env proteins in various cancers.', 'Locus-Specific Characterization of Human Endogenous Retrovirus Expression in Prostate, Breast, and Colon Cancers.', 'A new therapeutic approach for type 1 diabetes: Rationale for GNbAC1, an anti-HERV-W-Env monoclonal antibody.']"""

The most commonly used procedures in various urological centers are laparoscopic and robotic surgery because they are considered minimally invasive techniques. We present our experience in traditional open radical prostatectomy performed under spinal anesthesia.  Materials and methods:   We reviewed the clinical courses of 88 consecutive patients who underwent open radical prostatectomy performed under spinal anesthesia at our Institution.  Results:   Median age: 67.7 years. Median follow up duration: 48 months. Median pre-operative PSA: 15,9 ng/ml, median Prostate weight: 44.5 gr, median surgical time: 96.5 minutes (range 55-138). Perioperative complications were recorded. The most frequent complication was anemia, 9 cases need blood transfusion after surgery. Complications directly related to spinal anesthesia were not observed. Most patients were discharged within 5 days from the procedure. After two weeks we observed a quick recovery of total continence in 90% of patients. After 6 months all patients were perfectly continent. Erectile dysfunction after 6 months was reported by 48 patients.  Conclusions:   The reasons why the gold standard of radical prostatectomy surgery has been considered general anesthesia are essentially two: the long duration of the surgical procedure and the associated significant blood loss. Multiple evidences show that radical retropubic prostatectomy can be safely performed under spinal anaesthesia with various advantages. It is therefore no longer justified to consider general anesthesia as the gold standard for radical prostatectomy with an open technique.""","""['Salvatore Blanco', 'Angelica Grasso', 'Endrit Sulmina', 'Marco Grasso']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery for gynecologic and urologic oncology: an evidence-based analysis.', 'The effects of method of anaesthesia on the safety and effectiveness of Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy.', 'Perineal versus retropubic radical prostatectomy for T1, T2 prostate cancer.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'Critical comparative analysis between open, laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy: perioperative morbidity and oncological results (Part I).']"""

Bufalin extracted from Venenum Bufonis is one of the most effective anticancer monomers, which has been proved to play anticancer roles in a variety of cancers such as ovarian cancer, prostate cancer and neuroblastoma. However, there are few studies on bufalin in GC, and lack of clear targets. The effect of bufalin on the proliferation and migration of GC cells was detected by CCK-8, scratch wound healing assay, transwell assay and Western blotting. The potential direct interaction proteins of bufalin were screened by human proteome microarray containing 21,838 human proteins. The target protein was determined by bioinformatics, and the binding sites were predicted by molecular docking technique. Biological experiments in vitro and in vivo were conducted to verify the effect of bufalin directly interaction protein and the mechanism of bufalin targeting the protein to inhibit the development of GC. The results showed that bufalin inhibited the proliferation and migration of MKN-45 and HGC-27 GC cell lines in vitro. BFAR, a direct interaction protein of bufalin has several potential binding sites to bufalin. BFAR is highly expressed in GC and promotes the occurrence and metastasis of GC by activating PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway in vitro and in vivo. Bufalin reversed the promoting effect of BFAR on the carcinogenesis and metastasis of GC by down-regulating the expression of BFAR. Our results show that bufalin targeting BFAR inhibits the occurrence and metastasis of GC through PI3K/AKT/mTOR signal pathway.

Our study probed the functions of Brevilin A in prostate cancer cells and the mechanisms among Brevilin A, lncRNA H19, miR-194, and E2F3 on the biological behaviors of the cells. CCK8, Transwell, and TUNEL staining assays examined the impact of Brevilin A on prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, respectively. qRT-PCR and western blot determined lncRNA H19, miR-194, and E2F3 profiles. The influence of Brevilin A on the profiles of lncRNA H19, miR-194, and E2F3 was measured. A xenograft model of prostate cancer nude mice was taken to confirm the impact of Brevilin A and lncRNA H19 on cancer cell growth. Consequently, Brevilin A dampened prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, suppressed the expressions of lncRNA H19 and E2F3, and enhanced miR-194 level. LncRNA H19 and E2F3 were uplifted, whereas miR-194 was abated in prostate cancer cells and tissues. LncRNA H19 targeted miR-194 to positively modulate E2F3 expression, boosted DU145 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration, and curbed apoptosis. In the xenograft model, Brevilin A repressed tumor growth, whereas lncRNA H19 fostered tumor growth. Brevilin A suppressed the promotive effect of lncRNA H19 in PC cell growth in vivo.

Method:   Semi-structured interviews from a previous multi-methods study of primary care use by males with symptoms of possible prostate cancer were analysed using thematic framework analysis.  Results:   Symptoms were often interpreted by patients as unimportant. Most delays occurred due to the absence of reasons to seek help, which, in Black males, often stemmed from poor awareness of prostate cancer. This lack of awareness could have been a consequence of their reluctance to seek health information and discuss health issues with others in their social network.

Using an aggressive E0771 mouse breast cell line syngeneic immune-intact murine model, we observed that breast tumors were ""permanently eradicated"" in a genetically engineered tamoxifen-inducible Treg-cell-specific SRC-3 knockout (KO) female mouse that does not possess a systemic autoimmune pathological phenotype. A similar eradication of tumor was noted in a syngeneic model of prostate cancer. A subsequent injection of additional E0771 cancer cells into these mice showed continued resistance to tumor development without the need for tamoxifen induction to produce additional SRC-3 KO Tregs. SRC-3 KO Tregs were highly proliferative and preferentially infiltrated into breast tumors by activating the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand (Ccl) 19/Ccl21/chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (Ccr)7 signaling axis, generating antitumor immunity by enhancing the interferon-γ/C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (Cxcl) 9 signaling axis to facilitate the entrance and function of effector T cells and natural killer cells. SRC-3 KO Tregs also show a dominant effect by blocking the immune suppressive function of WT Tregs. Importantly, a single adoptive transfer of SRC-3 KO Tregs into wild-type E0771 tumor-bearing mice can completely abolish preestablished breast tumors by generating potent antitumor immunity with a durable effect that prevents tumor reoccurrence.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed positron emission tomography (PET) may identify additional areas of disease. In this work, we investigated using both PSMA PET and mpMRI in planning focal intraprostatic boosts using stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).  Methods and materials:   We evaluated a cohort of patients (n = 13) with localized prostate cancer who were imaged with 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-[18F]fluoro-pyridine-2-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (18F-DCFPyL) PET/MRI on a prospective imaging trial before undergoing definitive therapy. The number of lesions concordant (overlapping) and discordant (no overlap) on PET and MRI was assessed. Overlap between concordant lesions was evaluated using the Dice and Jaccard similarity coefficients. Prostate SBRT plans were created fusing the PET/MRI imaging to computed tomography scans acquired the same day. Plans were created using only MRI-identified lesions, only PET-identified lesions, and the combined PET/MRI lesions. Coverage of the intraprostatic lesions and doses to the rectum and urethra were assessed for each of these plans.  Results:   The majority of lesions (21/39, 53.8%) were discordant between MRI and PET, with more lesions seen by PET alone (12) than MRI alone (9). Of lesions that were concordant between PET and MRI, there were still areas that did not overlap between scans (average Dice coefficient, 0.34). Prostate SBRT planning using all lesions to define a focal intraprostatic boost provided the best coverage of all lesions without compromising constraints on the rectum and urethra.  Conclusions:   Using both mpMRI and PSMA-directed PET may better identify all areas of gross disease within the prostate. Using both imaging modalities could improve the planning of focal intraprostatic boosts.""","""['John M Floberg', 'Shane A Wells', 'Diane Ojala', 'R Adam Bayliss', 'Patrick M Hill', 'Brett A Morris', 'Zachary S Morris', 'Mark Ritter', 'Steve Y Cho']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Adv Radiat Oncol""","""['Prospective Evaluation of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT in Detection of High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: Comparison With mpMRI.', '18F-DCFPyL Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Localization of Dominant Intraprostatic Foci: First Experience.', 'Evaluating Biochemically Recurrent Prostate Cancer: Histologic Validation of 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT with Comparison to Multiparametric MRI.', 'Use and Impact of Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Prior to Salvage Radiation Therapy in Men with Biochemical Recurrence After Radical Prostatectomy: A Scoping Review.', 'Positron Emission Tomography and Whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Metastasis-directed Therapy in Hormone-sensitive Oligometastatic Prostate Cancer After Primary Radical Treatment: A Systematic Review.']"""

However, TE expression increases in a wide range of cancers and is correlated with global hypomethylation of cancer genomes. We assessed expression and DNA methylation of TEs in fibroblast cells that were serially transduced with hTERT, SV40, and HRASR24C to immortalize and then transform them, modeling the different steps of the tumorigenesis process. RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing were performed at each stage of transformation. TE expression significantly increased as cells progressed through transformation, with the largest increase in expression after the final stage of transformation, consistent with data from human tumors. The upregulated TEs were dominated by endogenous retroviruses [long terminal repeats (LTR)]. Most differentially methylated regions (DMR) in all stages were hypomethylated, with the greatest hypomethylation in the final stage of transformation. A majority of the DMRs overlapped TEs from the RepeatMasker database, indicating that TEs are preferentially demethylated. Many hypomethylated TEs displayed a concordant increase in expression. Demethylation began during immortalization and continued into transformation, while upregulation of TE transcription occurred in transformation. Numerous LTR elements upregulated in the model were also identified in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets of breast, colon, and prostate cancer. Overall, these findings indicate that TEs, specifically endogenous retroviruses, are demethylated and transcribed during transformation.

Interactions of TRIM11 with miR-5193 were demonstrated via dual luciferase reporter.  Results:   TRIM11 deficiency or miR-5193 overexpression exerted antiprostate cancer effects through suppression of proliferation, migration, and invasion as well as enhancement of apoptosis in PC-3 and DU145 cells.

However, there is a lack of information regarding the evolution of prostate cancer mortality rates in Ecuador and its regions in the last few decades.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to report prostate cancer mortality rates in Ecuador and its geographical areas and observe the evolution of these rates between 2004 and 2019.  Methods:   An observational ecological study was conducted, analysing data for prostate cancer deaths from 2004 to 2019 in Ecuador. Age standardized mortality rates (ASMR) were calculated per 100,000 men using the world standard population with the direct method proposed by SEGI. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to examine mortality trends. We used a Cluster Map to explore relationships among regions between 2015 and 2019.  Results:   Ecuador reported 13,419 deaths by prostate cancer between 2004 and 2019, with the Coastal region accounting for 49.8% of the total deaths. The mean age at death was 79 years (± 10 years), 91.7% were elderly (more than 65 years old) and had primary education (53%). Deaths by prostate cancer were more frequently reported among mestizos (81.4%). There were no significant variations in these percentages in Ecuador and its regions during the study period. Carchi province had the highest mortality rate in 2005 and 2019 (> 13 deaths per 100,000). Heterogeneity in the evolution of mortality rates was reported among the provinces of Ecuador. Azuay decreased in the first few years, and then increased from 2010 to 2019, whereas Guayas and Pichincha decreased throughout the whole period.  Conclusion:   Although prostate cancer mortality rates in Ecuador have remained stable over the past few decades, there are significant disparities among the different regions.

Methods:   We conducted a retrospective study at two French referral centers including consecutive cN0 PCa patients who underwent RP and extended pelvic lymph node dissection and had lymph node metastases on final pathological analysis (pN1) between January 2000 and May 2020. Follow-up was per institution, which generally included a PSA level measurement every 3 to 12 months for 5 years and annually thereafter.

We have previously reported that CCL2 induces resistance to the antiproliferative effect of cabazitaxel in DU145-TxR/CxR prostate cancer cell lines. However, how CCL2 induces resistance to the antimigration effect of cabazitaxel remains unclear.  Materials and methods:   We established a cabazitaxel-resistant cell line, DU145-TxR/CxR, from a previously established paclitaxel-resistant cell line, DU145-TxR, which was confirmed to show docetaxel resistance. We performed migration assay and analyzed the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers using DU145-TxR/CxR with or without CCL2 silencing with small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection.  Results:   Cabazitaxel inhibited the migration of DU145 cells through the inactivation of STAT3. A CCR2 (a specific receptor of CCL2) antagonist suppressed the migration of DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells under cabazitaxel treatment. Western blotting revealed that the CCR2 antagonist inhibited STAT3 phosphorylation in DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells under cabazitaxel treatment. CCL2 silencing with siRNA in DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells decreased migration through STAT3 and p38 inactivation. Furthermore, CCL2 activated AKT, and CCR2 antagonist inhibited AKT phosphorylation in DU145-TxR and DU145-TxR/CxR cells with recovery of sensitivity to cabazitaxel under cabazitaxel treatment.

Our objective was to identify a complex consisting of vimentin variant 3 (VIM3), autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7) and tumor protein p53 (TP53) in prostate cancer cells and its effect on microRNA (miR)-371a-3p.  Materials and methods:   Prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, LNCaP) and the benign prostatic hyperplasia cell line BPH-1 were cultured in growth medium for 24 h, then stimulated with endothelin 1 (EDN1) (50 nM) and withaferin A (2 nM) for 24 h. Cell extracts were then analyzed by western blot. The localization of VIM3, ATG7 and TP53 in the nucleus was demonstrated with immunofluorescence staining and complex formation was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. Cancer cell migration was analyzed with a scratch assay and agarose drop analysis. The binding of the complex to the promoter of pri-miR-371a-3p was analyzed with a non-radioactive electrophoretic mobility shift assay. VIM3 knockdown using small interfering RNA and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for miR-371a-3p were performed.  Results:   The complex was present in the nucleus of prostate cancer cells and in the BPH-1 cell line. EDN1 increased the levels of the complex partners and cell migration, whereas withaferin A reduced the levels of the complex partners and migration. The complex bound to the promoter of pri-miR-371a-3p and might be involved in its transcription. Transfection with miR-371a-3p increased migration of prostate cancer cells. VIM3 knockdown reduced miR-371a-3p expression.

Subsequently, taxanes are administered, but when PCa becomes resistant to taxanes, another treatment is needed, which has not yet been established. We previously synthesized a novel α-trifluoromethyl chalcone, YS71, and reported its antitumor effects against PCa cells. In this study, we confirmed its efficacy against androgen-sensitive, androgen-independent, and taxane-resistant PCa cells.  Materials and methods:   The PCa cell lines used were LNCaP, PC-3, DU145, PC-3-TxR (paclitaxel-resistant), PC-3-TxR/CxR (paclitaxel- and cabazitaxel-resistant), DU145-TxR, and DU145-TxR/CxR. The antiproliferative effects of YS71 were evaluated using proliferation assay. The reverse transcriptase transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot were performed to determine the expression level of androgen receptor (AR), whereas luciferase assay was performed to determine the AR activity. Furthermore, TUNEL assay and western blot were performed to investigate the mechanism of the antiproliferative effect.  Results:   YS71 exerted a dose-dependent antitumor effect, inhibited AR activity, and induced apoptosis in all PCa cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot showed that YS71 increased the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP, and decreased the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. In addition, microarray analysis revealed that YS71 decreased several cancer-related genes.  Conclusion:   YS71 exhibits antitumor activity by inducing apoptosis in PCa cells, including taxane-resistant cells.

This is a retrospective analysis of the safety of CIRT in patients with prostate cancer after rectal cancer surgery.  Patients and methods:   The subjects were 13 consecutive patients with prostate cancer who underwent CIRT after rectal cancer surgery at the Kanagawa Cancer Center from December 2015 to April 2022. A total dose of 51.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) was administered in 12 fractions over 3 weeks. The criteria stated in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, were used to assess toxicity. Fisher's exact test was performed to assess the associations between patient clinical factors and rectal toxicity.  Results:   The median patient age was 71 years (range=66-83 years). The median observation period was 27.4 months (range=10.6-82.4 months). The median duration from rectal surgery to CIRT was 6.9 years (1.0-16.8 years). Five (38.5%) and six (46.2%) patients had a planning target volume (PTV)-adjacent rectal anastomosis and diabetes mellitus, respectively, and two (15.4%) patients had both.

Cancer of the prostate is the fourth most common malignancy worldwide amongst both sexes and is the fifth leading cause of death in men, according to the 2020 census. It is also a malignancy related to a nation’s development index, like breast, lung, and colorectum cancers.   The cumulative incidence and mortality risk are higher in countries with very high Human Development Index (HDI) scores (7.88%) as opposed to those nations with low HDI (3.29%) scores.    In general, the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer are lowest in Asia and highest in the Caribbean and Africa. Western Europe, Australia, and North America have relatively high incidence rates but low mortality.    Even though patients with prostate cancer have improved overall survival, from a global perspective, this is a disease that requires attention in terms of better diagnostic and treatment modalities, especially in the metastatic setting. Properly used prostate cancer tissue-based biomarkers can significantly improve prognostic determinations, risk stratification, and treatment selection.   Until recently, prostate cancer diagnosis and risk stratification has been based solely on clinical stage, grade group/Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. The tumor being highly heterogenous, Gleason scoring adopts a sum of scores from two different histological areas. Clinicians use these variables to construct nomograms and risk calculators. The most commonly used prognostic tools are the Partin tables (to predict tumor and nodal stage after radical prostatectomy), the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram (predicts postoperative progression-free survival in addition to the tumor and nodal stage after radical prostatectomy), and the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score (to predict postoperative high-risk features, lymph node involvement and recurrence-free survival at 3 and 5 years). Additional tools are the Briganti nomogram and the Kattan nomogram.   Taken together, these clinicopathological variables and prognostic tools, though somewhat useful in real-world clinical situations, are inadequate to reliably predict the course of the disease as evidenced by real-world experience. Worse, they are rapidly becoming obsolete as the field of oncology is being catapulted by cutting-edge molecular diagnostics revolving around cancer genomics, transcriptomics, biomarkers, and epigenomics.   This article addresses the utility and clinical application of new and cutting-edge prostate cancer tissue-based biomarker assays that have either been approved by regulatory bodies or are in a developmental pipeline awaiting further research.""","""['Anu R I', 'Shafeek Shamsudeen', 'Stephen W.

Objectives:   The objective of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of PSMA in the neovasculature (identified by CD 31) of high-grade gliomas (HGGs) and to Correlate PSMA IHC expression in HGGs with clinicopathological features, to detect its possible role in tumor angiogenesis, where PSMA can be used as a future diagnostic and therapeutic target.  Materials and methods:   This retrospective study included a total of 69 archived, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of HGGs, including 52 cases classified as WHO grade IV (75.4%) and 17 cases as WHO grade III (24.6%). The samples were immunohistochemically analyzed for PSMA expression (in both TMV and parenchymal tumor cells) which was assessed using the composite PSMA immunostaining score. A score (0) was considered negative while scores 1-7 were considered positive (1-4, 5-6, or 7; weak, moderate, or strong respectively).  Results:   PSMA is expressed specifically and significantly in endothelial cells of tumor microvessels (TMV) of HGGs, A statistically significant relationship was detected between PSMA IHC expression in both TMV and in parenchymal tumor cells (TC) and various glioma subtypes (P-value < 0.05 and <0.001 respectively). Positive PSMA immunostaining in TMV was detected in all anaplastic ependymoma cases and in near all cases of classic GB and GB with oligodendroglial features more than other subtypes, with P-value specifically for PSMA positivity/negativity in TMV statistically significant (0.022). While for Tumor cells, Positive PSMA immunostaining was detected in all anaplastic ependymoma, most anaplastic astrocytoma and classic GB cases in contrary to other variants, with P-value statistically extremely significant (< 0.001). Comparing PSMA IHC expression in TMV and its expression in TC, it was significantly expressed in TMV of 82.7% versus TC of 51.9% of grade IV cases. Likewise, in GB with oligodendroglial features and gliosarcoma, the majority of cases showed positive staining in their TMV [8/8 (100%), 9/13 (69.2%) respectively], and, the reverse occurs in tumor cells where the majority of cases did NOT show staining in the tumor cells for PSMA (5/8 (62.5%), 11/13 (84.6%) of cases respectively), which was statistically significant (P-value ≤ 0.05) besides the significant difference in the pattern of staining according to composite PSMA scoring (P-value ≤ 0.05).  Conclusion:   PSMA has a possible role in tumor angiogenesis, therefore it might be considered a potential promising endothelial target for Cancer theranostics with PSMA-based agents, in addition, PSMA was expressed significantly in TC of HGGs, thus, it appears to be involved in biologic behavior, carcinogenesis and tumor progression.""","""['Mona Salah-Eldin Abdel Maguid', 'Menna-T-Allah Gamal Saad El Dine', 'Samia Mohamed Gabal', 'Sara Mahamad Abou Fandoud']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""['Potential use of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for detecting the tumor neovasculature of brain tumors by PET imaging with 89Zr-Df-IAB2M anti-PSMA minibody.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen expression in tumor-associated vasculature of breast cancers.', 'Prostate-specific membrane antigen as a potential novel vascular target for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme.', 'PSMA expression on neovasculature of solid tumors.', 'The prostate-specific membrane antigen: lessons and current clinical implications from 20 years of research.']"""

Prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA PET)/CT scans including the brain have identified incidental tumors.

Methods:   An institutional database was queried for patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 or 18F-DCFPyL (18F-piflufolastat) PET/CT imaging at an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center from 1/2018 to 12/2022. Imaging reports and clinical courses were reviewed to identify brain lesions and describe clinical and pathologic features.  Results:   Two-thousand seven hundred and sixty-three patients underwent 3363 PSMA PET/CT scans in the absence of neurologic symptoms. Forty-four brain lesions were identified, including 33 PSMA-avid lesions: 10 intraparenchymal metastases (30%), 4 dural-based metastases (12%), 16 meningiomas (48%), 2 pituitary macroadenomas (6%), and 1 epidermal inclusion cyst (3%) (incidences of 0.36, 0.14, 0.58, 0.07, and 0.04%). The mean parenchymal metastasis diameter and mean SUVmax were 1.99 cm (95%CI:1.25-2.73) and 4.49 (95%CI:2.41-6.57), respectively. At the time of parenchymal brain metastasis detection, 57% of patients had no concurrent extracranial disease, 14% had localized prostate disease only, and 29% had extracranial metastases. Seven of 8 patients with parenchymal brain metastases remain alive at a median 8.8 months follow-up.

In this sense, our study evaluates the aspects that comprise the interactions of testosterone agonists (TES), dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) in complex with the AR. In addition, we also evaluated the impact of ligand-receptor affinity differences in a mutation model. We apply computational techniques based on density functional theory (DFT) and use, as methodology, Molecular Fractionation with Conjugate Caps (MFCC). The energetic specificities present in the interaction between the analyzed complexes attest that the highest affinity with the AR receptor is found for AR-THG, followed by AR-DHT, AR-TES and AR-T877A-DHT, respectively. Our results also show the differences and equivalences between the different agonists, in addition to evaluating the difference between the DHT ligand in complex with the wild-type and mutant receptor, presenting the main amino acid residues that involve the interaction with the ligands.
