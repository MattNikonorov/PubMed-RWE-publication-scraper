Consequently, elucidating the key molecular regulators that govern disease progression could substantially contribute to the establishment of novel therapeutic strategies, ultimately advancing the management of PCa.  Methods:   A total of 49 PCa tissues and 43 adjacent normal tissues were collected from January 2017 to December 2021 at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University. The advanced transcriptomic methodologies were employed to identify differentially expressed mRNAs in PCa. The expression of aspartoacylase (ASPA) in PCa was thoroughly evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting techniques. To elucidate the inhibitory role of ASPA in PCa cell proliferation and metastasis, a comprehensive set of in vitro and in vivo assays were conducted, including orthotopic and tumor-bearing mouse models (n = 8 for each group). A combination of experimental approaches, such as Western blotting, luciferase assays, immunoprecipitation assays, mass spectrometry, glutathione S-transferase pull-down experiments, and rescue studies, were employed to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of ASPA's action in PCa. The Student's t-test was employed to assess the statistical significance between two distinct groups, while one-way analysis of variance was utilized for comparisons involving more than two groups. A two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was deemed to indicate statistical significance.  Results:   ASPA was identified as a novel inhibitor of PCa progression. The expression of ASPA was found to be significantly down-regulated in PCa tissue samples, and its decreased expression was independently associated with patients' prognosis (HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.40-0.92, P = 0.018). Our experiments demonstrated that modulation of ASPA activity, either through gain- or loss-of-function, led to the suppression or enhancement of PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, respectively. The inhibitory role of ASPA in PCa was further confirmed using orthotopic and tumor-bearing mouse models. Mechanistically, ASPA was shown to directly interact with the LYN and inhibit the phosphorylation of LYN as well as its downstream targets, JNK1/2 and C-Jun, in both PCa cells and mouse models, in an enzyme-independent manner. Importantly, the inhibition of LYN activation by bafetinib abrogated the promoting effect of ASPA knockdown on PCa progression in both in vitro and in vivo models. Moreover, we observed an inverse relationship between ASPA expression and LYN activity in clinical PCa samples, suggesting a potential regulatory role of ASPA in modulating LYN signaling.  Conclusion:   Our findings provide novel insights into the tumor-suppressive function of ASPA in PCa and highlight its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the management of this malignancy.""","""['Hong Weng#', 'Kang-Ping Xiong#', 'Wang Wang#', 'Kai-Yu Qian#', 'Shuai Yuan', 'Gang Wang', 'Fang Yu', 'Jun Luo', 'Meng-Xin Lu', 'Zhong-Hua Yang', 'Tao Liu', 'Xing Huang', 'Hang Zheng', 'Xing-Huan Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mil Med Res""","""['Hsa_circ_0004296 inhibits metastasis of prostate cancer by interacting with EIF4A3 to prevent nuclear export of ETS1 mRNA.', 'Downregulation of miR-133a-3p promotes prostate cancer bone metastasis via activating PI3K/AKT signaling.', 'MALAT1 knockdown inhibits prostate cancer progression by regulating miR-140/BIRC6 axis.', 'miR-199b-5p-DDR1-ERK signalling axis suppresses prostate cancer metastasis via inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition.', 'm6 A modification of lncRNA PCAT6 promotes bone metastasis in prostate cancer through IGF2BP2-mediated IGF1R mRNA stabilization.']"""

Deterioration of TH signaling has been associated with several pathologies, including cancer. The effect of highly active triiodothyronine (T3) has been investigated in many in vivo and in vitro cancer models. However, the role of T3 on cancerous prostate tissue is controversial today. Recent studies have focused on the characterization of the supportive roles of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling in prostate cancer (PCa) and investigating new hormonal regulation patterns, including estrogen, progesterone and 1,25(OH)2D3. Additionally, androgenic signaling controlled by androgens, which are critical in PCa progression, has been shown to be regulated by other steroid hormones. Today, the effects of T3 on ERAD and UPR are unknown, the impact on androgenic signaling is also still not fully understood in PCa. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the molecular action of T3 on the ERAD mechanism and UPR signaling in PCa cells and also extensively examined the effect of T3 on androgenic signaling. Our data indicated that T3 tightly regulated ERAD and UPR signaling in androgen-dependent PCa cells. We also found that T3 hormone stimulated androgenic signaling by upregulating AR mRNA and protein levels and enhancing its nuclear translocation. Additionally, advanced computational studies supported the ligand binding effect of T3 on AR protein. Our data suggest that targeting thyroidal signaling should be considered in therapeutic approaches to be developed for prostate malignancy in addition to other steroidal regulations.""","""['Yalcin Erzurumlu', 'Muhammed Tilahun Muhammed']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Signal""","""['Progesterone regulates the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and Unfolded Protein Response axis by mimicking the androgenic stimulation in prostate cancer cells.', '1,25(OH)2 D3 induced vitamin D receptor signaling negatively regulates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) and androgen receptor signaling in human prostate cancer cells.', 'Estrogens drive the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation and promote proto-oncogene c-Myc expression in prostate cancer cells\xa0by androgen receptor/estrogen receptor signaling.', 'Divergent Modulation of Proteostasis in Prostate Cancer.', 'Mif1: a missing link between the unfolded protein response pathway and ER-associated protein degradation?']"""

Computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) tools powered by deep learning can help radiologists interpret multiple volumetric images. In this work, our objective was to examine promising methods recently proposed in the multigrade prostate cancer detection task and to suggest practical considerations regarding model training in this context.  Methods:   We collected 1647 fine-grained biopsy-confirmed findings, including Gleason scores and prostatitis, to form a training dataset. In our experimental framework for lesion detection, all models utilized 3D nnU-Net architecture that accounts for anisotropy in the MRI data. First, we explore an optimal range of b-values for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) modality and its effect on the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) and prostatitis using deep learning, as the optimal range is not yet clearly defined in this domain. Next, we propose a simulated multimodal shift as a data augmentation technique to compensate for the multimodal shift present in the data. Third, we study the effect of incorporating the prostatitis class alongside cancer-related findings at three different granularities of the prostate cancer class (coarse, medium, and fine) and its impact on the detection rate of the target csPCa. Furthermore, ordinal and one-hot encoded (OHE) output formulations were tested.  Results:   An optimal model configuration with fine class granularity (prostatitis included) and OHE has scored the lesion-wise partial Free-Response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 1.94 (CI 95%: 1.76-2.11) and patient-wise ROC AUC of 0.874 (CI 95%: 0.793-0.938) in the detection of csPCa. Inclusion of the auxiliary prostatitis class has demonstrated a stable relative improvement in specificity at a false positive rate (FPR) of 1.0 per patient, with an increase of 3%, 7%, and 4% for coarse, medium, and fine class granularities.  Conclusions:   This paper examines several configurations for model training in the biparametric MRI setup and proposes optimal value ranges. It also shows that the fine-grained class configuration, including prostatitis, is beneficial for detecting csPCa. The ability to detect prostatitis in all low-risk cancer lesions suggests the potential to improve the quality of the early diagnosis of prostate diseases. It also implies an improved interpretability of the results by the radiologist.""","""['Oleksii Bashkanov', 'Marko Rak', 'Anneke Meyer', 'Lucas Engelage', 'Agron Lumiani', 'Rolf Muschter', 'Christian Hansen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""['Comparison of biparametric and multiparametric MRI in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.', 'The value of machine learning models based on biparametric MRI for diagnosis of prostate cancer and clinically significant prostate cancer.', 'Multiparametric MRI in detection and staging of prostate cancer.', 'Deep Learning Reconstruction Enables Highly Accelerated Biparametric MR Imaging of the Prostate.', 'What Is the Negative Predictive Value of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Excluding Prostate Cancer at Biopsy?

In this study, we identified CAF-related molecular subtypes and prognostic index for PCa patients undergoing radical prostatectomy through integrating single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data. We completed analyses using software R 3.6.3 and its suitable packages. Through single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing analysis, NDRG2, TSPAN1, PTN, APOE, OR51E2, P4HB, STEAP1 and ABCC4 were used to construct molecular subtypes and CAF-related gene prognostic index (CRGPI). These genes could clearly divide the PCa patients into two subtypes in TCGA database and the BCR risk of subtype 1 was 13.27 times higher than that of subtype 2 with statistical significance. Similar results were observed in MSKCC2010 and GSE46602 cohorts. In addtion, the molucular subtypes were the independent risk factor of PCa patients. We orchestrated CRGPI based on the above genes and divided 430 PCa patients in TCGA database into high- and low- risk groups according to the median value of this score. We found that high-risk group had significant higher risk of BCR than low-risk group (HR: 5.45). For functional analysis, protein secretion was highly enriched in subtype 2 while snare interactions in vesicular transport was highly enriched in subtype 1. In terms of tumor heterogeneity and stemness, subtype 1 showd higher levels of TMB than subtype 2. In addition, subtype 1 had significant higher activated dendritic cell score than subtype 2. Based on eight CAF-related genes, we developed two prognostic subtypes and constructed a gene prognostic index, which could predict the prognosis of PCa patients very well.""","""['Youliang Qian#', 'Dechao Feng#', 'Jie Wang#', 'Wuran Wei', 'Qiang Wei', 'Ping Han', 'Lu Yang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""['Identification of senescence-related molecular subtypes and key genes for prostate cancer.', 'Energy Metabolism-Related Gene Prognostic Index Predicts Biochemical Recurrence for Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy.', 'Mitochondria Dysfunction-Mediated Molecular Subtypes and Gene Prognostic Index for Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy or Radiotherapy.', 'A TMEFF2-regulated cell cycle derived gene signature is prognostic of recurrence risk in prostate cancer.', 'The prognostic and predictive value of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion and ERG protein expression in prostate cancer biopsies.']"""

To identify genes that modulate treatment response to these drugs, we performed three genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens in the mCRPC cell line C4. The screens identified seven candidates for enzalutamide (BCL2L13, CEP135, E2F4, IP6K2, KDM6A, SMS, and XPO4), four candidates for docetaxel (DRG1, LMO7, NCOA2, and ZNF268), and nine candidates for cabazitaxel (ARHGAP11B, DRG1, FKBP5, FRYL, PRKAB1, RP2, SMPD2, TCEA2, and ZNF585B). We generated single-gene C4 knockout clones/populations for all genes and could validate effect on treatment response for five genes (IP6K2, XPO4, DRG1, PRKAB1, and RP2). Altered enzalutamide response upon IP6K2 and XPO4 knockout was associated with deregulation of AR, mTORC1, and E2F signaling, and deregulated p53 signaling (IP6K2 only) in C4 mCRPC cells.

This study aimed to construct and evaluate a 5-year PCa risk prediction model using a cohort with PSA < 10 ng/mL by incorporating PSA levels and individual factors.  Methods:   The PCa risk prediction model including PSA levels and individual risk factors was constructed using a cohort of 69,319 participants from the Kangbuk Samsung Health Study. 201 registered PCa incidences were observed. A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to generate the 5-year risk of PCa. The performance of the model was assessed using standards of discrimination and calibration.  Results:   The risk prediction model included age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, family history of PCa, past medical history of dyslipidemia, cholesterol levels, and PSA level. Especially, an elevated PSA level was a significant risk factor of PCa (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.67-1.88]). This model performed well with sufficient discrimination ability and satisfactory calibration (C-statistic: 0.911, 0.874; Nam-D'Agostino test statistic:19.76, 4.21 in the development and validation cohort, respectively).  Conclusions:   Our risk prediction model was effective in predicting PCa in a population according to PSA levels. When PSA levels are inconclusive, an assessment of both PSA and specific individual risk factors (e.g., age, total cholesterol, and family history of PCa) could provide further information in predicting PCa.""","""['Taewon Hwang', 'Hyungseok Oh', 'Jung Ah Lee', 'Eo Jin Kim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""['Histological inflammation and risk of subsequent prostate cancer among men with initially elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration in the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial.', 'A ""PSA pyramid"" for men with initial prostate-specific antigen ≤3 ng/ml: a plea for individualized prostate cancer screening.', 'Prediction models for prostate cancer to be used in the primary care setting: a systematic review.', 'Do prostate cancer risk models improve the predictive accuracy of PSA screening?

However, its therapeutic efficacy as a potential anticancer agent has been limited owing to poor aqueous solubility, short circulation time, rapid reticuloendothelial system uptake, and high renal clearance, which consecutively showed poor bioavailability. In the present investigation, we developed polyethylene glycol (PEG) decorated solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) using the solvent diffusion method to increase the biopharmaceutical properties of DOC. PEG monostearate (SA-PEG2000) was initially synthesized and characterized using various analytical techniques. Afterwards, DOC-loaded SLN was synthesized with and without SA-PEG2000and systematically characterized for in-vitro and in-vivo properties. Spherical-shaped SA-PEG2000-DOC SLN showed hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of 177 nm and -13 mV, respectively. During the in-vitro release study DOC-loaded SLN showed a controlledrelease of approximately 54.35 % ± 5.46 within 12 h with Higuchi release kinetics in the tumor microenvironment (pH 5.5).In an in-vitro cytotoxicity study,SA-PEG2000-DOC SLN showedsignificantlylower IC50values(p < 0.001)compared to DOC-SLN and DOC aloneagainst prostate cancer cell lines (PC-3). Similarly, an in-vitro cellular uptake study showed a significant increase in intracellular DOC concentration for SA-PEG2000-DOC SLN. Additionally, inin-vivostudies,PEGylated SLN of DOC showed around 2- and 15-fold increase in the maximum concentration of drug (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC), respectively, as compared to plain DOC solution due to the uniquehydrophilicity and hydrophobicity balance and electrical neutrality of specially designed PEG architect. The biological half-life (t1/2) and mean residence time (MRT) was found to increase from 8.55 and 11.43 to 34.96 and 47.68 h, respectively, with SA-PEG2000-DOC SLN. Moreover, the bio-distribution study indicates high DOC concentration in the plasma which signifies the more pronounced blood residence time of SA-PEG2000-DOC SLN.

Here, we report additional health-related quality of life (HRQOL), pain, and symptomatic skeletal event results.  Methods:   This multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial was conducted at 84 cancer centres in nine countries in North America and Europe. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older; had progressive PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of 0-2; and had previously received of at least one androgen receptor pathway inhibitor and one or two taxane-containing regimens. Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 plus protocol-permitted standard of care ([177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group) or standard of care alone (control group) using permuted blocks. Randomisation was stratified by baseline lactate dehydrogenase concentration, liver metastases, ECOG performance status, and androgen receptor pathway inhibitor inclusion in standard of care. Patients in the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group received intravenous infusions of 7·4 gigabecquerel (GBq; 200 millicurie [mCi]) [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 every 6 weeks for four cycles plus two optional additional cycles. Standard of care included approved hormonal treatments, bisphosphonates, and radiotherapy. The alternate primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, which have been reported. Here we report the key secondary endpoint of time to first symptomatic skeletal event, and other secondary endpoints of HRQOL assessed with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) and EQ-5D-5L, and pain assessed with the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF). Patient-reported outcomes and symptomatic skeletal events were analysed in all patients who were randomly assigned after implementation of measures designed to reduce the dropout rate in the control group (on or after March 5, 2019), and safety was analysed according to treatment received in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03511664, and is active but not recruiting.  Findings:   Between June 4, 2018, and Oct 23, 2019, 831 patients were enrolled, of whom 581 were randomly assigned to the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group (n=385) or control group (n=196) on or after March 5, 2019, and were included in analyses of HRQOL, pain, and time to first symptomatic skeletal event. The median age of patients was 71 years (IQR 65-75) in the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 72·0 years (66-76) in the control group. Median time to first symptomatic skeletal event or death was 11·5 months (95% CI 10·3-13·2) in the [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 group and 6·8 months (5·2-8·5) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·50, 95% CI 0·40-0·62).

Some metals contribute to ambient PM2.5 and possibly to its adverse effects. But the challenge of assessing exposure to airborne metals limits epidemiological studies.  Objective:   To analyze the relationships between several airborne metals and risk of cancer in a large population.  Methods:   We estimated the individual exposure to 12 airborne metals of ∼ 12,000 semi-urban and rural participants of the French population-based Gazel cohort using moss biomonitoring data from a 20-year national program. We used principal component analyses (PCA) to derive groups of metals, and focused on six single carcinogenic or toxic metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, nickel, and vanadium). We used extended Cox models with attained age as time-scale and time-varying weighted average exposures, adjusted for individual and area-level covariables, to analyze the association between each exposure and all-site combined, bladder, lung, breast, and prostate cancer incidence.  Results:   We identified 2,401 cases of all-site cancer between 2001 and 2015. Over the follow-up, median exposures varied from 0.22 (interquartile range (IQR): 0.18-0.28) to 8.68 (IQR: 6.62-11.79) µg.g-1 of dried moss for cadmium and lead, respectively. The PCA yielded three groups identified as ""anthropogenic"", ""crustal"", and ""marine"". Models yielded positive associations between most single and groups of metal and all-site cancer, with e.g. hazard ratios of 1.08 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.13) for cadmium or 1.06 (95% CI: 1.02,1.10) for lead, per interquartile range increase. These findings were consistent across supplementary analyses, albeit attenuated when accounting for total PM2.5. Regarding specific site cancers, we estimated positive associations mostly for bladder, and generally with large confidence intervals.

The use of a single antigenic agent is unlikely to be effective in eliciting immunotherapeutic responses due to the heterogeneous and multifocal nature of prostate cancer. Thus, multiple antigens have been combined to enhance their anti-cancer effects. In the current study, PSA and PAP were fused to the crystallizable region (Fc region) of immunoglobulin G1 and tagged with KDEL, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal motif, to generate PSA-FcK and PAP-FcK, respectively, and were transiently co-expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana.

There are two major surveillance mechanisms to suppress ferroptosis: one mediated by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) that catalyzes the reduction of phospholipid peroxides and the other mediated by enzymes, such as FSP1, that produce metabolites with free radical-trapping antioxidant activity. In this study, through a whole-genome CRISPR activation screen, followed by mechanistic investigation, we identified phospholipid-modifying enzymes MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 as ferroptosis suppressors. MBOAT1/2 inhibit ferroptosis by remodeling the cellular phospholipid profile, and strikingly, their ferroptosis surveillance function is independent of GPX4 or FSP1. MBOAT1 and MBOAT2 are transcriptionally upregulated by sex hormone receptors, i.e., estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR), respectively.

Towards the goal of mimicking prostate cancer progression and metastasis, we engineered a tunable hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel platform with protease degradable and cell adhesive properties employing bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation with strained alkenes. The synthetic matrix was first fabricated via a slow tetrazine-norbornene reaction, then temporally modified via a diffusion-controlled method using trans-cyclooctene, a fierce dienophile that reacts with tetrazine with an unusually fast rate. The encapsulated DU145 prostate cancer single cells spontaneously formed multicellular tumoroids after 7 days of culture. In situ modification of the synthetic matrix via covalent tagging of cell adhesive RGD peptide induced tumoroid decompaction and the development of cellular protrusions. RGD tagging did not compromise the overall cell viability, nor did it induce cell apoptosis. In response to increased matrix adhesiveness, DU145 cells dynamically loosen cell-cell adhesion and strengthen cell-matrix interactions to promote an invasive phenotype. Characterization of the 3D cultures by immunocytochemistry and gene expression analyses demonstrated that cells invaded into the matrix via a mesenchymal like migration, with upregulation of major mesenchymal markers, and down regulation of epithelial markers. The tumoroids formed cortactin positive invadopodia like structures, indicating active matrix remodeling.

Given the relationship between outcomes and surgical experience [5-7], it is crucial to implement a step-by-step approach for each surgical step of the procedure, especially in the most challenging part of the intervention. In this video compilation, we described the techniques for bladder neck dissection utilized at OLV Hospital (Aalst, Belgium).  Surgical technique:   We illustrated five different techniques for bladder neck dissection during RARP. The anterior technique tackles the bladder neck from above until the urethral catheter is visualized, and then the dissection is completed posteriorly. The lateral and postero-lateral approaches involve the identification of a weakness point at the prostate-vesical junction and aim to develop the posterior plane - virtually until the seminal vesicles - prior to the opening of the urethra anteriorly. Finally, we described our techniques for bladder neck dissection in more challenging cases such as in patients with bulky middle lobes and prior surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia. All approaches follow anatomic landmarks to minimize positive surgical margins and aim to preserve the bladder neck in order to promote optimal functional recovery. All procedures were performed with DaVinci robotic platforms using a 3-instruments configuration (scissors, fenestrated bipolar, and needle driver). As standard protocol at our Institution, urinary catheter was removed on postoperative day two [8].  Conclusions:   Five different approaches for bladder neck dissection during RARP were described in this video compilation.

Prostate cancer cell lines are essential tools to understanding the basic features of this malignancy, as well as in identifying novel therapeutic strategies. However, most cell lines routinely used in prostate cancer research are derived from metastatic disease and may not fully elucidate the molecular events underlying the early stages of cancer development and progression. Thus, there is a need for new cell lines derived from localised disease to better span the disease spectrum.  Methods:   Prostatic tissue from the primary site, and adjacent non-cancerous tissue was obtained from four patients with localised disease undergoing radical prostatectomy. Epithelial cell outgrowths were immortalised with human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) E6 and E7 to establish monoclonal cell lines. Chromosomal ploidy was imaged and STR profiles were determined. Cell morphology, colony formation and cell proliferation characteristics were assessed. Androgen receptor (AR) expression and AR-responsiveness to androgen treatment were analysed by immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR, respectively. RNA-seq analysis was performed to identify prostate lineage markers and expression of prostate cancer tumorigenesis-related genes.  Results:   Two benign cell lines derived from non-cancer cells (AQ0420 and AQ0396) and two tumour tissue derived cancer cell lines (AQ0411 and AQ0415) were immortalised from four patients with localised prostatic adenocarcinoma. The cell lines presented an epithelial morphology and a slow to moderate proliferative rate. None of the cell lines formed anchorage independent colonies or displayed AR-responsiveness. Comparative RNA-seq expression analysis confirmed the prostatic lineage of the four cell lines, with a distinct gene expression profile from that of the metastatic prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3 and LNCaP.

Due to a lack of head-to-head trials, they are prescribed interchangeably. However, the drugs have different pharmacokinetics and thus may have differing efficacy and adverse effects influenced by patient functional status and comorbid diseases. Additionally, mCRPC mainly affects older adults and since the prevalence of frailty increases with age, frailty is an important patient factor to consider in personalizing drug selection.  Materials and methods:   We conducted a retrospective observational study of US veterans treated with abiraterone or enzalutamide for mCRPC from September 2014 to June 2017. Frailty was assessed using the Veterans Affairs Frailty Index (VA-FI), which utilizes administrative codes to assign a standardized frailty score. Patients were categorized as frail if VA-FI scores were > 0.2. The primary outcome was difference in overall survival (OS) between the two treatment groups. Cox regression modeling and propensity score matching was used to compare between abiraterone and enzalutamide treatments.  Results:   We identified 5,822 veterans, 57% of whom were initially treated with abiraterone and 43% with enzalutamide. Frail patients (n = 2,314; 39.7%) were older, with a mean age of 76.1 versus 74.9 years in the non-frail group (n = 3,508; 60.3%, p < 0.001) and had shorter OS compared to non-frail patients regardless of treatment group (18.5 vs. 26.6 months, p < 0.001). Among non-frail patients there was no significant difference in OS between abiraterone and enzalutamide treatment (27.7 vs 26.1 months, p = 0.07). However, frail patients treated with enzalutamide versus abiraterone had improved OS (20.7 vs 17.2 months, p < 0.001). In a propensity score matched analysis of frail patients (n = 2,070), enzalutamide was associated with greater median OS (24.1 vs 20.9 months, p < 0.001). In patients with dementia, enzalutamide was associated with longer OS (19.4 vs. 16.6 months, p = 0.003).  Discussion:   In this study of 5822 US veterans with mCRPC, treatment with enzalutamide was associated with improved OS compared to abiraterone among frail veterans and veterans with dementia, but not among non-frail veterans. Future studies should evaluate interactions between frailty and cancer treatments to optimize selection of therapy among frail adults.""","""['Ekamjit S Deol', 'Kristen M Sanfilippo', 'Suhong Luo', 'Mark A Fiala', 'Tanya Wildes', 'Hira Mian', 'Martin W Schoen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Geriatr Oncol""","""['Survival of veterans treated with enzalutamide and abiraterone for metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer based on comorbid diseases.', 'Economic Outcomes in Patients with Chemotherapy-Naïve Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Treated with Enzalutamide or Abiraterone Acetate Plus Prednisone.', 'The role of frailty in modifying physical function and quality of life over time in older men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.', 'Effectiveness and tolerability of targeted drugs for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.', 'Androgen annihilation versus advanced androgen blockage as first line treatment for metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.']"""

Therefore, the impact of a comprehensive assessment of sarcopenia on clinical outcomes in men with mCRPC is poorly understood. The objectives of this study were to comprehensively assess sarcopenia through CT scans and measures of muscle function and examine its impact on severe treatment toxicity, time to first emergency room (ER) visit, disease progression, and overall mortality in men initiating chemotherapy or androgen receptor-targeted axis (ARAT) therapy for mCRPC.  Methods:   This was a secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of men with mCRPC at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre between July 2015-May 2021. Participants were classified as sarcopenic if they had CT-based low muscle mass or low muscle density, a grip strength and gait speed score of <35.5kg and <0.8m/s, respectively, prior to treatment initiation. The impact of sarcopenia on severe treatment toxicity was assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to determine the impact of sarcopenia on risk of visiting the ER, prostate-specific antigen progression, radiographic progression, and overall mortality.  Results:   A total of 110 men (mean age: 74.6) were included in the analysis. At baseline, 30 (27.3%) were classified as sarcopenic. Sarcopenia was a significant predictor of severe toxicity (aOR = 6.26, 95%CI = 1.17-33.58, P = 0.032) and ER visits (aHR = 4.41, 95%CI = 1.26-15.43, p = 0.020) in men initiating ARAT but not in men initiating chemotherapy. Sarcopenia was also a predictor of radiographic progression (aHR = 2.39, 95%CI = 1.06-5.36, p = 0.035) and overall mortality (aHR = 2.44, 95%CI = 1.17-5.08, p = 0.018) regardless of treatment type.

Methods:   A consecutive sample of intermediate to high-risk prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET, extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND), and radical prostatectomy (RP) at two tertiary referral centers were retrospectively identified. The training cohort comprised 173 patients (treated between 2013 and 2017), the validation cohort 90 patients (treated between 2016 and 2019). Three models for LNI prediction were developed and evaluated using cross-validation. Optimal risk-threshold was determined during model development. The best performing model was evaluated and compared to available conventional and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI)-based prediction models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA).  Results:   A combined model including prostate-specific antigen, biopsy Gleason grade group, [68Ga]Ga Ga-PSMA-11 positive volume of the primary tumor, and the assessment of the [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 report N-status yielded an AUC of 0.923 (95% CI 0.863-0.984) in the external validation. Using a cutoff of ≥ 17%, 44 (50%) ePLNDs would be spared and LNI missed in one patient (4.8%). Compared to conventional and MRI-based models, the proposed model showed similar calibration, higher AUC (0.923 (95% CI 0.863-0.984) vs. 0.700 (95% CI 0.548-0.852)-0.824 (95% CI 0.710-0.938)) and higher net benefit at DCA.  Conclusions:   Our results indicate that information from [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 may improve LNI prediction in intermediate to high-risk PCa patients undergoing primary staging especially when combined with clinical parameters.

To illustrate the differences between mortality predictions from stage-shift models that ignore versus preserve prognostic subtype, we use ovarian cancer partitioned by histologic subtype and prostate cancer partitioned by grade.

Results:   In the lowest SES quintile, survival was higher among younger Canadian adults diagnosed with liver (23% vs 15%) and cervical (78% vs 68%) cancers and with leukemia (62% vs 56%), including children diagnosed with ALL (92% vs 86%); and higher among older Americans diagnosed with colon (62% vs 56%), female breast (87% vs 80%), and prostate (97% vs 85%) cancers.

Conclusions:   Among younger Canadian cancer patients in the lowest SES group, greater access to health care may have resulted in higher cancer survival, while higher screening prevalence and access to health insurance (Medicare) among older Americans during the period of this study may have resulted in higher survival for some screen-detected cancers.

For both the CONFIDENT-B and CONFIDENT-P trials, the specific pathology specimens will be pseudo-randomised to be assessed by a pathologist with or without AI assistance in a pragmatic (bi-)weekly sequential design. In the intervention group, pathologists will assess whole slide images (WSI) of the standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections assisted by the output of the algorithm. In the control group, pathologists will assess H&E WSI according to the current clinical workflow. If no tumour cells are identified or when the pathologist is in doubt, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining will be performed. At least 80 patients in the CONFIDENT-P and 180 patients in the CONFIDENT-B trial will need to be enrolled to detect superiority, allocated as 1:1.

Materials and methods:   Men with unilateral intermediate-risk prostate cancer undergoing primary partial gland cryoablation since March 2017 enrolled in a prospective outcome registry. The postablation protocol for all men included surveillance prostate biopsy at 2 years postablation and reflex prostate biopsy for cases with high suspicion of recurrence (eg, progressive rise in PSA). Recurrence of clinically significant prostate cancer was defined as any Gleason grade group ≥2 disease on postablation biopsy. Freedom from failure represented no whole gland salvage treatment, metastatic prostate cancer, or prostate cancer mortality. Freedom from recurrence and freedom from failure were characterized using nonparametric maximum likelihood estimators.  Results:   A total of 132 men had at least 24 months of follow-up data. Biopsies identified clinically significant prostate cancer in 12 men. At 36 months, model-estimated rates of freedom from recurrence of in-field, out-of-field, and overall clinically significant cancer were 97% (95% CI: 92-100), 87% (95% CI: 80-94), and 86% (95% CI: 78-93), respectively. The model-estimated proportion with freedom from failure at 36 months was 97% (95% CI: 93-100).  Conclusions:   The low in-field cancer detection rate at 3 years indicates successful ablation of localized cancers. Conversely, our observed out-of-field detection rate highlights the need for continued surveillance following partial gland cryoablation. Many of these recurrences exhibited very low volume of clinically significant disease below the detection threshold of multiparametric MRI, suggesting a limited role for multiparametric MRI in detecting clinically significant recurrences at 2 years. These findings emphasize the need for long-term surveillance and identification of predictors of clinically significant prostate cancer recurrences to guide biopsy timing.""","""['James S Wysock', 'Eli Rapoport', 'Hunter Hernandez', 'Rozalba Gogaj', 'Herbert Lepor']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Urol""","""['Editorial Comment.', 'Early oncological control following partial gland cryo-ablation: a prospective experience specifying reflex MRI guided biopsy of the ablation zone.', 'Propensity Score-Matched Comparison of Partial to Whole-Gland Cryotherapy for Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of the Cryo On-Line Data Registry Data.', 'A Prospective Pilot Study Investigating Performance of 18F-Fluciclovine PET Imaging for Detection of Prostate Cancer 2 Years Following Primary Partial Gland Cryoablation.', 'Oncological control following partial gland ablation for intermediate-risk prostate cancer.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

PSMA can be targeted by 177Lu conjugated to PSMA-617, a high-affinity ligand for the PSMA. The binding of the radioligand, 177Lu-PSMA-617, results in its internalisation and delivery of β-radiation into the cancer cells. However, PSMA-617, a component of the final product in the synthesis of the radioligand, may also play a role in the pathophysiology of PCa cells. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of PSMA-617 (10, 50 and 100 nM) on the expression of PSMA in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells, their proliferation, 177Lu-PSMA-617-induced cell death by WST-1 and lactate dehydrogenase assays, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617. PSMA-617 at 100 nM concentration induced cell-growth arrest, down-regulated cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 (by 43 and 36%, respectively) and up-regulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 (by 48%). Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated reduced content of DNA, pointing to a lower rate of cell division. PSMA-617 (up to 100 nM) did not alter the uptake of 177Lu-PSMA-617 into the LNCaP cells. Interestingly, simultaneous treatment with 177Lu-PSMA-617 and PSMA-617 for 24 and 48 h substantially potentiated the cell-death promoting effects of the radioligand. In conclusion, the combination of impeding tumour cell proliferation by PSMA-617 and its potentiation of the radiation-induced cell death brought about by 177Lu-PSMA-617 in PCa cells may considerably improve the outcome of the radiation therapy with 177Lu-PSMA-617, especially in patients with decreased radiosensitivity of PCa cells to the radioligand.""","""['Yi Zhao', 'Juraj Culman', 'Ingolf Cascorbi', 'Niklas Nithack', 'Marlies Marx', 'Maaz Zuhayra', 'Ulf Lützen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol""","""['Development of 177LuLu-LNC1003 for radioligand therapy of prostate cancer with a moderate level of PSMA expression.', 'Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Implications for Expanding the Therapeutic Window.', 'Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors.', 'Treatment of Advanced Metastatic Prostate Cancer Using Molecular-Targeted Therapy: Radioligand Lutetium-177 Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen.', '177LuLu-PSMA-617 (PluvictoTM): The First FDA-Approved Radiotherapeutical for Treatment of Prostate Cancer.']"""

Methods:   From November 2019 and April 2022, patients who underwent elective colorectal cancer surgery at Seoul St. Mary's hospital were collected retrospectively. A UC was inserted in the operating room after general anesthesia and removed in the operating room immediately after surgery. The primary outcome was the occurrence of POUR following immediate UC removal after surgery, and the secondary outcomes were the identification of POUR-related risk factors and postoperative complications.  Results:   Among 737 patients, 81 (10%) had POUR immediately after UC removal. No patient had urinary tract infection. The incidence of POUR was significantly higher in male and in those with a history of urinary disease. However, there were no significant differences in tumor location, surgical procedure, or approach. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the POUR group. Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates did not differ significantly between two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for POUR were male, a history of urinary disease, and intrathecal morphine injection.

Methods:   The mRNA expression profiles and the corresponding clinical information for prostate cancer patients from TCGA, cBioPortal, and GEO databases. Samples were classified using unsupervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) clustering based on differentially expressed metabolism-related genes (MAGs). The characteristics of disease-free survival (DFS), clinicopathological characteristics, pathways, TME, immune cell infiltration, response to immunotherapy, and sensitivity to chemotherapy between subclusters were explored. A prognostic signature was constructed by LASSO cox regression analysis based on differentially expressed MAGs and followed by the development for prognostic prediction.  Results:   A total of 76 MAGs between prostate cancer samples and non-tumorous samples were found, then 489 patients were divided into two metabolism-related subclusters for prostate cancer. The significant differences in clinical characteristics (age, T/N stage, Gleason) and DFS between two subclusters. Cluster 1 was associated with cell cycle and metabolism-related pathways, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), etc., involved in cluster 2. Moreover, lower ESTIMATE/immune/stromal scores, lower expression of HLAs and immune checkpoint-related genes, and lower half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values in cluster 1 compared with cluster 2.

Methods:   We performed a retrospective cohort study at London Health Sciences Centre and St. Joseph's Health Care London, London, Ontario, Canada. We evaluated all pathologically staged breast, colorectal, prostate, endometrial and lung cancers (the 5 most common cancers by site, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) over a 3-year period (Mar. 15, 2018-Mar. 14, 2021). The pre-COVID-19 group included procedures performed between Mar. 15, 2018, and Mar. 14, 2020, and the COVID-19 group included procedures performed between Mar. 15, 2020, and Mar. 14, 2021. The primary outcome was cancer stage group, based on the pathologic tumour, lymph node, metastasis system. We performed univariate analyses to compare demographic characteristics, pathologic features and cancer stage between the 2 groups. We performed multivariable ordinal regression analyses using the proportional odds model to evaluate the association between stage and timing of staging (before v. during the pandemic).  Results:   There were 4055 cases across the 5 cancer sites. The average number of breast cancer staging procedures per 30 days increased during the pandemic compared to the yearly average in the pre-COVID-19 period (41.3 v. 39.6), whereas decreases were observed for endometrial cancer (15.9 v. 16.4), colorectal cancer (21.8 v. 24.3), prostate cancer (13.6 v. 18.5) and lung cancer (11.5 v. 15.9). For all cancer sites, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics, pathologic features or cancer stage between the 2 groups (p > 0.05). In multivariable regression analysis, for all cancer sites, cases staged during the pandemic were not associated with higher stage (breast: odds ratio [OR] 1.071, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.826-1.388; colorectal: OR 1.201, 95% CI 0.869-1.661; endometrium: OR 0.792, 95% CI 0.495-1.252; prostate: OR 1.171, 95% CI 0.765-1.794; and lung: OR 0.826, 95% CI 0.535-1.262).  Interpretation:   Cancer cases staged during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic were not associated with higher stage; this likely reflects the prioritization of cancer procedures during times of reduced capacity.

In this work, we estimated the 5-year crude probabilities of death from cancer and from other causes for five common cancers, namely stomach, lung, colon-rectum, prostate and breast, in Japan, using population-based registry data. Based on data on 344 676 patients diagnosed with one of these cancers between 2006 and 2008 in 21 prefectures participating in the Monitoring of Cancer Incidence in Japan (MCIJ) and followed-up for at least 5 years, we used a flexible excess hazard model to compute the crude probabilities of death for different combinations of sex, age and stage at diagnosis. For tumours diagnosed at the distant stage, as well as for regional lung tumours, the vast majority of deaths at 5 years in cancer patients were attributable to the disease itself (although this proportion was only around 60% in older prostate cancer patients). For localised and most regional tumours, the impact of other causes of death on the total mortality increased with age at diagnosis, especially for localised breast, colorectal and gastric cancer. By allowing the partition of the mortality experience of cancer patients into a cancer- and an other-cause-specific component, crude probability of death estimates provide insight into how the impact of cancer on mortality might differ among populations with different background mortality risks.

However, the molecular mechanisms of ion signaling promoting cancer behavior are poorly understood and the complexity of the underlying remodeling during metastasis remains to be explored. Here, using a variety of in vitro and in vivo techniques, we show that metastatic prostate cancer cells acquire a specific Na+ /Ca2+ signature required for persistent invasion. We identify the Na+ leak channel, NALCN, which is overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer, as a major initiator and regulator of Ca2+ oscillations required for invadopodia formation. Indeed, NALCN-mediated Na+ influx into cancer cells maintains intracellular Ca2+ oscillations via a specific chain of ion transport proteins including plasmalemmal and mitochondrial Na+ /Ca2+ exchangers, SERCA and store-operated channels. This signaling cascade promotes activity of the NACLN-colocalized proto-oncogene Src kinase, actin remodeling and secretion of proteolytic enzymes, thus increasing cancer cell invasive potential and metastatic lesions in vivo. Overall, our findings provide new insights into an ion signaling pathway specific for metastatic cells where NALCN acts as persistent invasion controller.""","""['Antoine Folcher#', 'Dmitri Gordienko#', 'Oksana Iamshanova#', 'Alexandre Bokhobza', 'George Shapovalov', 'Dheeraj Kannancheri-Puthooru', 'Pascal Mariot', 'Laurent Allart', 'Emilie Desruelles', 'Corentin Spriet', 'Raquel Diez', 'Thibauld Oullier', 'Séverine Marionneau-Lambot', 'Lucie Brisson', 'Sandra Geraci', 'Hathaichanok Impheng', ""V'yacheslav Lehen'kyi"", 'Aurélien Haustrate', 'Adriana Mihalache', 'Pierre Gosset', 'Stéphanie Chadet', 'Stéphanie Retif', 'Maryline Laube', 'Julien Sobilo', 'Stéphanie Lerondel', 'Giulia Villari', 'Guido Serini', 'Alessandra Fiorio Pla', 'Sébastien Roger', 'Gaelle Fromont-Hankard', 'Mustafa Djamgoz', 'Philippe Clezardin', 'Arnaud Monteil', 'Natalia Prevarskaya']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""EMBO J""","""['Intracellular calcium oscillations in strongly metastatic human breast and prostate cancer cells: control by voltage-gated sodium channel activity.', 'NALCN ion channels have alternative selectivity filters resembling calcium channels or sodium channels.', 'Nalcn Is a ""Leak"" Sodium Channel That Regulates Excitability of Brainstem Chemosensory Neurons and Breathing.', 'Regulation and Role of Store-Operated Ca2+ Entry in Cellular Proliferation.', 'The sodium leak channel, NALCN, in health and disease.']"""

The current study aimed to investigate the extent of BF and associated factors in different phases of the survivorship continuum.  Methods:   In this cross-sectional study, men affected by PCa who were either already treated with radical prostatectomy or going to be treated with radical prostatectomy at a large German PCa center were included. These men were stratified into four groups (prior to surgery, up to 12 months after surgery, 2-5 years and ≥ 6-10 years after surgery). BF was assessed using the German version of the 17-item Benefit Finding Scale (BFS). The items are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5. A total mean score ≥ 3 was considered as moderate-to-high BF. Associations with clinical and psychological factors were assessed in men presenting before and in those who participated after surgery. Multiple linear regression was applied to identify intendent determinants of BF.  Results:   2,298 men affected by PCa (mean age at survey: 69.5,SD = 8.2; median follow-up: 3 years (25th -75th percentile 0.5-7)) were included. 49.6% of men reported moderate-to-high BF. The mean BF score was 2.91 (SD = 0.92). BF reported by men before surgery did not differ significantly from BF reported by men in the years after surgery (p = 0.56). Higher BF prior to and following radical prostatectomy was associated with higher perceived severity of the disease (pre-surgery: ß = 0.188, p = 0.008; post-surgery: ß = 0.161, p = < 0.0001) and higher cancer-related distress (pre-surgery: ß ? 0.155, p = 0.03; post-surgery: ß = 0.089, p < 0.0001). Post radical prostatectomy BF was also associated with biochemical recurrence during follow-up (ß = 0.089, p = 0.001), and higher quality of life (ß = 0.124, p < 0.001).  Conclusions:   Many men affected by PCa perceive BF already soon after diagnosis. The subjective perception of threat or severity associated with the diagnosis of PCa is an essential factor for higher levels of BF, probably more important than objective indicators of the severity of the disease. The early onset of BF and the high degree of similarity of BF reported across the different phases of survivorship suggests that BF is, to a large extent, a dispositional personal characteristic and a cognitive strategy of positively coping with cancer.""","""['Matthias Jahnen', 'Patrick Bayer', 'Valentin H Meissner', 'Stefan Schiele', 'Helga Schulwitz', 'Jürgen E Gschwend', 'Kathleen Herkommer', 'Andreas Dinkel']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""['Benefit finding in long-term prostate cancer survivors.', 'Diversity of cancer-related identities in long-term prostate cancer survivors after radical prostatectomy.', 'The long-term clinical impact of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer 5 or more years after radical prostatectomy.', 'Laparoscopic and robotic-assisted versus open radical prostatectomy for the treatment of localised prostate cancer.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

Evidently, prevalent transcription factors and signaling pathways define their relationship. The etiology of the prostatic disorder is multifactorial including heavy metal toxicity like lead (Pb), Cadmium (Cd), and genetic factors. This study elucidates the association between heavy metal toxicity Pb, Cd, and CYP1A1 gene polymorphism with BPH and CaP.  Methods:   a case-control study with (BPH, n = 104), (CaP, n = 58) and (controls, n =107) patients. Heavy metal Pb and Cd estimation by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The polymorphism of the CYP1A1 T>C (rs4646903) gene was analyzed byPCR-RFLP.  Result:   Higher levels of Pb and Cd were found in BPH and CaP followed by the control group (P-value: < 0.05). Pb and Cd show a significant correlation among prostate volume in CaP. Additionally, PSA, IPSS score, and pre void volume were positively co-related with Pb in BPH patients. The posthoc test defines the level of Pb and Cd as significantly elevated in the mutant genotype, highest among homozygous mutant genotype of CYP1A1gene among BPH. In CaP, Pb is significantly higher among the homozygous mutant type of CYP1A1 gene. The risk is also influenced by smoking, tobacco, and alcohol.  Conclusion:   The heavy metal toxicity Pb and Cd were reported to raise the risk of BPH and CaP.

Objective:   To describe the prevalence of germline genetic testing among patients diagnosed with cancer in California and Georgia between 2013 and 2019.  Design, setting, and participants:   Observational study including patients aged 20 years or older who had been diagnosed with any type of cancer between January 1, 2013, and March 31, 2019, that was reported to statewide Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in California and Georgia. These patients were linked to genetic testing results from 4 laboratories that performed most germline testing for California and Georgia.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was germline genetic testing within 2 years of a cancer diagnosis. Testing trends were analyzed with logistic regression modeling. The results of sequencing each gene, including variants associated with increased cancer risk (pathogenic results) and variants whose cancer risk association was unknown (uncertain results), were evaluated. The genes were categorized according to their primary cancer association, including breast or ovarian, gastrointestinal, and other, and whether practice guidelines recommended germline testing.  Results:   Among 1 369 602 patients diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2019 in California and Georgia, 93 052 (6.8%) underwent germline testing through March 31, 2021. The proportion of patients tested varied by cancer type: male breast (50%), ovarian (38.6%), female breast (26%), multiple (7.5%), endometrial (6.4%), pancreatic (5.6%), colorectal (5.6%), prostate (1.1%), and lung (0.3%). In a logistic regression model, compared with the 31% (95% CI, 30%-31%) of non-Hispanic White patients with male breast cancer, female breast cancer, or ovarian cancer who underwent testing, patients of other races and ethnicities underwent testing less often: 22% (95% CI, 21%-22%) of Asian patients, 25% (95% CI, 24%-25%) of Black patients, and 23% (95% CI, 23%-23%) of Hispanic patients (P < .001 using the χ2 test). Of all pathogenic results, 67.5% to 94.9% of variants were identified in genes for which practice guidelines recommend testing and 68.3% to 83.8% of variants were identified in genes associated with the diagnosed cancer type.

Methods:   Nine patients followed up for glioblastomas who received MRI during 12 months of follow-up were referred for both 68 Ga-PSMA-11 and 18 F-FDOPA PET/CT. The SUV max , lesion-to-striatum ratio, lesion-to-normal parenchyma ratio, and lesion-to-salivary gland ratio were calculated.  Results:   Good correlation between 18 F-FDOPA and 68 Ga-PSMA PET/CT findings was seen in 5 patients. In 4 patients, the findings of both examinations were consistent with recurrence but were better visualized with the PSMA PET/CT. Examinations of the fifth patient were suggestive of postradiation-related changes and were better analyzed with the PSMA PET/CT, which displayed relatively low uptake compared with DOPA PET/CT. Conversely, 4 patients showed conflicting results: recurrence was not detected on the PSMA PET/CT because of previously introduced bevacizumab treatment; in another patient, both examinations were consistent with recurrence, but there was an uptake mismatch at the suspected lesion sites, and 2 patients presented with inconsistent findings.  Conclusions:   Despite a few discrepancies, this study highlights the potential role of 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT for discriminating postradiation inflammation from recurrence. 68 Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT has an excellent lesion-to-background ratio, and false-positive and false-negative results could be minimized through implementing certain protocols before performing the examination.

Using genetically encoded PAR cleavage biosensors, we showed that PC3 cells secrete proteolytic enzymes that cleave PARs and trigger autocrine signaling. CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of PAR1 and PAR2 combined with microarray analysis revealed genes that are regulated through this autocrine signaling mechanism. We found several genes that are known PCa prognostic factors or biomarker to be differentially expressed in the PAR1-knockout (KO) and PAR2-KO PC3 cells. We further examined PAR1 and PAR2 regulation of PCa cell proliferation and migration and found that absence of PAR1 promotes PC3 cell migration and suppresses cell proliferation, whereas PAR2 deficiency showed opposite effects.

The efficiency of miRNA binding was investigated using various parameters namely free energy (AMFE), GC and GC3 content, translation efficiency, cosine similarity metric, mRNA stability, free energy of RNA duplex, and base compositional difference. BLAST2GO software was used to elucidate the functional roles of the genes overexpressed in prostate cancer.  Results:   The current research reveals that the coding sequences of the genes were found targeted with multiple miRNAs. For instance, the HPN gene was targeted by the microRNA miR-4279 at two distinct sites i.e. 263-278 and 746-761 in the coding sequence. In the present study, it was observed that the target region of the genes exhibited a comparatively high GC and GC3 contents in comparison to the flanking regions. A low translational rate and weak relationship between RSCU and tRNA were obtained which may be due to the absence of optimal codons.  Conclusion:   In this study, we have uncovered the human miRNAs that have potential for binding to the coding sequences of 14 most overexpressed genes in prostate cancer and thereby could silence those genes.""","""['Arpita Purkayastha', 'Aparajita Roy', 'Stella Bharadaj', 'Srinjay Kumar Bharadaj', 'Supriyo Chakraborty']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Clin Oncol""","""['Binding sites of miRNA on the overexpressed genes of oral cancer using 7mer-seed match.', 'A Study on microRNAs Targeting the Genes Overexpressed in Lung Cancer and their Codon Usage Patterns.', 'Silencing lung cancer genes using miRNAs identified by 7mer-seed matching.', 'miRNA Targeting: Growing beyond the Seed.', 'Computational Biology in microRNA.']"""

In Japan, little attention has been paid to the importance of providing care for SD associated with PC treatment. This study is aimed at clarifying the care needs of Japanese men regarding SD associated with PC treatment.  Methods:   One-to-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with 44 PC patients to identify their care needs. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.  Results:   Four core categories emerged from the analysis. (1) ""Need for empathy from medical staff regarding fear of SD"": patients had difficulty confiding in others about their sexual problems, and medical staff involvement in their SD issues was lacking. (2) ""Need for information that provides an accurate understanding of SD and coping strategies before deciding on treatment"": lack of information about SD in daily life and difficulty understanding information from medical institutions, caused men to regret their treatment. (3) ""Need for professional care for individuals and couples affected by SD"": men faced loss of intimacy because of their partners' unwillingness to understand their SD issues or tolerate non-sexual relationships. (4) ""Need for an environment that facilitates interaction among men to resolve SD issues"": men felt lonely and wanted to interact with other patients about their SD concerns.

Demographic and anatomopathological factors that increase the probability of reclassifying patients have been identified.  Materials and methods:   Laboratory and histopathological data were collected from 116 patients included on AS since 2014. Univariate analysis was performed with Chi-square, t-student and Kendall's Tau, multivariate analysis according to logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were calculated.  Results:   Of the 116 patients in AS, the median age at diagnosis was 66 years and the median follow-up was 13 months (2-72). Of these, 61 (52.6%) are still on surveillance, while 55 (47.4%) have left the program, mostly due to histological progression (52 patients (45.2%)); radical prostatectomy was performed in 27 (49.1%). Prostate volume (PV)≤60cc and the number of positive cylinders >1 in diagnostic biopsy (P=.05) were associated with higher reclassification rate in univariate analysis (P<.05). Multivariate analysis showed that these two variables significantly correlated with higher reclassification rate (PV 60 cc: OR 4.39, P=.04; >1 positive cylinder at diagnostic biopsy: OR 2.48, P=.03).  Conclusions:   It has been shown that initial ultrasound volume and the number of positive cylinders in the diagnostic biopsy are independent risk factors for reclassification.

Although the main BRCA1 protein is well characterized, further proteomics studies have already identified additional BRCA1 isoforms with lower molecular weights. However, the accurate nucleotide sequence determination of their corresponding mRNAs is still a barrier, mainly due to the increased mRNA length of BRCA1 (~5.5 kb) and the limitations of the already implemented sequencing approaches. In the present study, we designed and employed a multiplexed hybrid sequencing approach (Hybrid-seq), based on nanopore and semi-conductor sequencing, aiming to detect BRCA1 alternative transcripts in a panel of human cancer and non-cancerous cell lines. The implementation of the described Hybrid-seq approach led to the generation of highly accurate long sequencing reads that enabled the identification of a wide spectrum of BRCA1 splice variants (BRCA1 sv.7 - sv.52), thus deciphering the transcriptional landscape of the human BRCA1 gene. In addition, demultiplexing of the sequencing data unveiled the expression profile and abundance of the described BRCA1 mRNAs in breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, lung and brain cancer as well as in non-cancerous human cell lines. Finally, in silico analysis supports that multiple detected mRNAs harbour open reading frames, being highly expected to encode putative protein isoforms with conserved domains, thus providing new insights into the complex roles of BRCA1 in genomic stability and DNA damage repair.""","""['Panagiotis G Adamopoulos', 'Konstantina Athanasopoulou', 'Michaela A Boti', 'Georgios Dimitroulis', 'Glykeria N Daneva', 'Panagiotis Tsiakanikas', 'Andreas Scorilas']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""RNA Biol""","""[""BRCA1, a 'complex' protein involved in the maintenance of genomic stability."", 'Identification of gene fusion transcripts by transcriptome sequencing in BRCA1-mutated breast cancers and cell lines.', 'Mitochondrial localization, ELK-1 transcriptional regulation and growth inhibitory functions of BRCA1, BRCA1a, and BRCA1b proteins.', 'The BRCA1 alternative splicing variant Δ14-15 with an in-frame deletion of part of the regulatory serine-containing domain (SCD) impairs the DNA repair capacity in MCF-7 cells.', 'Interplay between BRCA1 and GADD45A and Its Potential for Nucleotide Excision Repair in Breast Cancer Pathogenesis.']"""

The material is a synthetic quinoxaline derivative-based iron nanocomposite fabricated on graphene nanoplatelet surface (1d-Fe-Gr). Presence of graphene enhanced the efficacy of synthesized 1d-Fe-Gr to sense PSA in serum medium with an impressive limit of detection (LOD) value of 0.878 pg/mL compared to 1d-Fe alone (LOD 17.619 pg/mL) using UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. LOD of PSA by 1d-Fe-Gr using Raman spectroscopy is even more impressive (0.410 pg/mL). Moreover, presence of interfering biomolecules like glucose, cholesterol, bilirubin and insulin in serum improves the detection threshold significantly in presence of 1d-Fe-Gr which otherwise cause LOD values of PSA to elevate in control sets. In presence of these biomolecules, the LOD values improve significantly as compared to healthy conditions in the range 0.623-3.499 pg/mL. Thus, this proposed detection method could also be applied efficiently to the patients suffering from different pathophysiological disorders. These biomolecules may also be added externally during analyses to improve the sensing ability.

Materials and Methods: Seven men with biopsy-proven LRPC involving the SV with or without adjacent prostate following primary RT or FT underwent combined salvage focal cryoablation (FCA) and robotic excision of the SV. Descriptive statistics characterized the cohort and outcomes. Results: Median follow-up was 1.4 years. There were no surgical complications, and the length of stay was 1 day in all cases. No patients experienced any new urinary incontinence following removal of the catheter. Erectile function was preserved in both men exhibiting preoperative erections adequate for intercourse. Of the four patients developing recurrent disease, three involved only the contralateral SV; they all underwent a second salvage FCA and robotic seminal vesiculectomy (RSV). One patient presenting with high-risk disease developed systematic metastasis. He is alive and managed with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). One patient developed persistent local disease recurrence and is on ADT. The other five patients are disease-free based on the most recent multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Conclusions: This study highlights the feasibility and effectiveness of salvage FCA and RSV as a salvage treatment for LRPC of the SV with or without involvement of the prostate following primary RT or FT.

Here, we evaluated the cytotoxic capacity of this compound itself and combined with Docetaxel, Enzalutamide and Olaparib as an adjuvant agent. We observed that Ocoxin reduced tumor cell viability; slowed down cell cycles; altered the expression of genes involved in DNA replication, cell cycles and the p53 signaling pathway; and reduced migratory capacity after stimulation with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and osteoblasts in vitro and reduced tumor volume in vivo. The combination of the nutritional supplement with chemotherapy showed a higher cytotoxic effect than chemotherapy alone and reverted chemoresistance conferred by CAFs and osteoblasts. Moreover, the adjuvant therapy also improved the outcome in vivo compared to the treatment with solo chemotherapy, where mice developed smaller tumors and less angiogenesis.

Our study aimed to evaluate the potential suppressive effect of miR-137 in a model of advanced PCa with and without diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. In vitro, PC-3 cells were treated with 50 pmol of mimic miR-137 for 24 h, and gene and protein expression levels of SRC-1, SRC-2, SRC-3, and AR were evaluated by qPCR and immunofluorescence. We also assessed migration rate, invasion, colony-forming ability, and flow cytometry assays (apoptosis and cell cycle) after 24 h of miRNA treatment. For in vivo experiments, 16 male NOD/SCID mice were used to evaluate the effect of restoring miR-137 expression together with cholesterol. The animals were fed a standard (SD) or hypercholesterolemic (HCOL) diet for 21 days. After this, we xenografted PC-3 LUC-MC6 cells into their subcutaneous tissue. Tumor volume and bioluminescence intensity were measured weekly. After the tumors reached 50 mm3, we started intratumor treatments with a miR-137 mimic, at a dose of 6 μg weekly for four weeks. Ultimately, the animals were killed, and the xenografts were resected and analyzed for gene and protein expression. The animals' serum was collected to evaluate the lipid profile. The in vitro results showed that miR-137 could inhibit the transcription and translation of the p160 family, SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3, and indirectly reduce the expression of AR. After these analyses, it was determined that increased miR-137 inhibits cell migration and invasion and impacts reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis rates. The in vivo results demonstrated that tumor growth was arrested after the intratumoral restoration of miR-137, and proliferation levels were reduced in the SD and HCOL groups. Interestingly, the tumor growth retention response was more significant in the HCOL group. We conclude that miR-137 is a potential therapeutic miRNA that, in association with androgen precursors, can restore and reinstate the AR-mediated axis of transcription and transactivation of androgenic pathway homeostasis.

Targeting the STAT3 protein through high-affinity ligands to reduce its levels or activity in cancer has noteworthy therapeutic potential. T40214 (STAT) [(G3C)4] is a G4 aptamer that can influence STAT3 biological outcomes in an efficient manner in several cancer cells. To explore the effects of an extra cytidine in second position and/or of single site-specific replacements of loop residues in generating aptamers that can affect the STAT3 biochemical pathway, a series of STAT and STATB [GCG2(CG3)3C] analogues containing a thymidine residue instead of cytidines was prepared. NMR, CD, UV, and PAGE data suggested that all derivatives adopt dimeric G4 structures like that of unmodified T40214 endowed with higher thermal stability, keeping the resistance in biological environments substantially unchanged, as shown by the nuclease stability assay. The antiproliferative activity of these ODNs was tested on both human prostate (DU145) and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cells. All derivatives showed similar antiproliferative activities on both cell lines, revealing a marked inhibition of proliferation, particularly at 72 h at 30 µM. Transcriptomic analysis aimed to evaluate STAT's and STATB's influence on the expression of many genes in MDA-MB-231 cells, suggested their potential involvement in STAT3 pathway modulation, and thus their interference in different biological processes.

We have found that AOH itself modulates the cell cycle, inflammation, and apoptosis, rather than the steroidogenesis process in prostate cancer cells; however, in the presence of another steroidogenic agent, the influence on steroidogenesis is significant. Therefore, this is the first study to report the effect of AOH on local steroidogenesis in normal and prostate cancer cells.

Epidemiological studies showed a decrease in cancer rates in patients with neurodegenerative disorders, including the Huntington disease (HD). Apoptosis is one of the most important processes for both cancer and neurodegeneration. We suggest that genes closely connected with apoptosis and associated with HD may affect carcinogenesis. We applied reconstruction and analysis of gene networks associated with HD and apoptosis and identified potentially important genes for inverse comorbidity of cancer and HD. The top 10 high-priority candidate genes included APOE, PSEN1, INS, IL6, SQSTM1, SP1, HTT, LEP, HSPA4, and BDNF. Functional analysis of these genes was carried out using gene ontology and KEGG pathways. By exploring genome-wide association study results, we identified genes associated with neurodegenerative and oncological disorders, as well as their endophenotypes and risk factors. We used publicly available datasets of HD and breast and prostate cancers to analyze the expression of the identified genes. Functional modules of these genes were characterized according to disease-specific tissues. This integrative approach revealed that these genes predominantly exert similar functions in different tissues. Apoptosis along with lipid metabolism dysregulation and cell homeostasis maintenance in the response to environmental stimulus and drugs are likely key processes in inverse comorbidity of cancer in patients with HD.

Routinely collected hospital care data were obtained for all men in CAP, and NHS reference costs were mapped to each event via Healthcare Resource Group (HRG) codes. Secondary-care costs per man per year were calculated, and cost differences (and population-level estimates) between arms were derived annually for the first five years following randomisation.  Results:   In the first year post-randomisation, secondary-care costs averaged across all men (irrespective of a prostate cancer diagnosis) in the intervention arm (n = 189279) were £44.80 (95% confidence interval: £18.30-£71.30) higher than for men in the control arm (n = 219357). Extrapolated to a population level, the introduction of a single PSA screening invitation could lead to additional secondary care costs of £314 million.

We uncover dual-phosphorylated form of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBF1), pY673/951-SREBF1 that acts as an androgen sensor, and dissociates from androgen receptor (AR) in androgen deficient environment, followed by nuclear translocation. SREBF1 recruits KAT2A/GCN5 to deposit epigenetic marks, histone H2A Lys130-acetylation (H2A-K130ac) in SREBF1, reigniting de novo lipogenesis & steroidogenesis. Androgen prevents SREBF1 nuclear translocation, promoting T cell exhaustion.

Methods:   A total of 128 patients with primary high-risk localized CaP who had received NCHT followed by radical prostatectomy (RP) were included. Androgen receptor (AR), AR splice variant-7 (AR-V7) and Ki-67 staining were evaluated in prostate biopsy specimens by immunohistochemistry. The pathologic response to NCHT in whole mount RP specimens was measured based on the reduction degree of tumor volume and cellularity compared to the paired pretreatment needle biopsy, and divided into 5 tier grades (Grades 0-4). Patients with Grades 2 to 4 (the reduction degree more than 30%) were defined as having a favorable response. Logistic regression was performed to explore the predictive factors associated with a favorable pathologic response. The predictive accuracy was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the ROC curve (AUC).  Results:   Ninety-seven patients (75.78%) had a favorable response to NCHT. Logistic regression showed that the preoperative PSA level, low AR expression and high Ki-67 expression in biopsy specimens were associated with a favorable pathologic response (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the AUC of the preoperative PSA level, AR and Ki-67 were 0.625, 0.624 and 0.723, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that the rate of favorable pathologic response to NCHT was 88.5% in patients with ARlowKi-67high, which was higher than patients with ARlowKi-67low, ARhighKi-67low, and ARhighKi-67high (88.5% vs. 73.9%, 72.9%, and 70.9%, all P < 0.05).  Conclusions:   A lower preoperative PSA level was an independent predictive factor for a favorable pathologic response. Moreover, the expression status of AR and Ki-67 in biopsy specimens were associated with differential pathologic response to NCHT, and AR low/Ki-67 high was also associated with favorable response but warrants further evaluation in this patient subgroup and future trial clinical trial design.""","""['Junjie Fan', 'Hua Liang', 'Yanan Gu', 'Zhangdong Jiang', 'Fan Jiang', 'Yingchun Wang', 'Dalin He', 'Kaijie Wu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""['Head-to-head comparisons of 68GaGa-PSMA-11 PET/CT, multiparametric MRI, and prostate-specific antigen for the evaluation of therapeutic responses to neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy in high-risk non-metastatic prostate cancer patients: a prospective study.', 'Neoadjuvant chemohormonal therapy combined with radical prostatectomy and extended PLND for very high risk locally advanced prostate cancer: A retrospective comparative study.', 'Radical Prostatectomy With and Without Neoadjuvant Chemohormonal Pretreatment for High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer: A Comparative Propensity Score Matched Analysis.', 'Angiogenesis, p53, bcl-2 and Ki-67 in the progression of prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy.', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen-Based Screening for Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Evidence Review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Internet.']"""

Despite the remarkable success of immunotherapy against many types of cancer, most patients with PCa receive minimal benefit from current immunotherapeutic strategies, because PCa is an immune cold tumor with scarce T-cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to develop an effective immunotherapeutic approach for immune cold PCa tumors.  Methods:   The therapeutic efficacy of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and zoledronic acid (ZA) plus thymosin α1 (Tα1) therapy was analyzed retrospectively in patients with advanced or metastatic PCa. The effects and mechanisms by which ZA and Tα1 regulated the immune functions of PCa cells and immune cells were evaluated by a PCa allograft mouse model, flow cytometric analysis, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence staining assays, and PCR, ELISA, and Western blot analyses.  Results:   In this study, clinical retrospective analysis revealed that ADT combined with ZA plus Tα1 improved the therapeutic outcomes of patients with PCa, which might be associated with an enhanced frequency of T cells. ZA and Tα1 treatment synergistically inhibited the growth of androgen-independent PCa allograft tumors, with increased infiltration of tumor-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and enhanced tumor inflammation. Functionally, ZA and Tα1 treatment relieved immunosuppression in PCa cells, stimulated pro-inflammatory macrophages, and enhanced the cytotoxic function of T cells. Mechanistically, ZA plus Tα1 therapy blocked the MyD88/NF-κB pathway in PCa cells but activated this signaling in macrophages and T cells, altering the tumor immune landscape to suppress PCa progression.  Conclusions:   These findings uncover a previously undefined role for ZA and Tα1 in inhibiting the disease progression of immune cold PCa tumors by enhancing antitumor immunity and pave the way for the application of ZA plus Tα1 therapy as an immunotherapeutic strategy for treating patients with immunologically unresponsive PCa.""","""['Sheng Wang#', 'Maohua Huang#', 'Minfeng Chen#', 'Zhiting Sun#', 'Yubo Jiao', 'Geni Ye', 'Jinghua Pan', 'Wencai Ye', 'Jianfu Zhao', 'Dongmei Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Immunother Cancer""","""['Efficacy of zoledronic acid for the elimination of disseminated tumor cells in a clinically relevant, spontaneously metastatic prostate cancer xenograft model.', 'The anti-tumor efforts of thymosin alpha1 on tumor lysate-pulsed dendritic cells in colon cancer in vitro and in vivo.', 'Combination of Gemcitabine and Thymosin alpha 1 exhibit a better anti-tumor effect on nasal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.', 'Thymosin α1 and Its Role in Viral Infectious Diseases: The Mechanism and Clinical Application.', 'EAU guidelines on prostate cancer.

This study aimed to determine the procedure involved in radio-resistant prostate cancer apoptosis. For a deeper insight, we devoted a novel bioinformatics approach to analyze the targeting between microRNAs and radio-resistant prostate cancer genes.  Method:   This study uses the Tarbase, and the Mirtarbase databases as validated experimental databases and mirDIP as a predicted database to identify microRNAs that target radio-resistant anti-apoptotic genes. These genes are used to construct the radio-resistant prostate cancer genes network using the online tool STRING. The validation of causing apoptosis by using microRNA was confirmed with flow cytometry of Annexin V.  Results:   The anti-apoptotic gene of radio-resistant prostate cancer included BCL-2, MCL1, XIAP, STAT3, NOTCH1, REL, REL B, BIRC3, and AKT1 genes. These genes were identified as anti-apoptotic genes for radio-resistant prostate cancer. The crucial microRNA that knockdown all of these genes was hsa-miR-7-5p.

Materials and Methods: The inclusion criteria were as follows: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) >2 ng/mL, and/or positive digital rectal examination (DRE), and/or suspicious lesion on transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (Pi-RADS) v2.1 ≥ 3 score. In total, 102 patients were enrolled in the study. Biopsies were performed by two urologists. In a single procedure, the first urologist performed a FUS-TB and TPMB followed by second urologist who performed TRUS-GB and COG-TB. All specimens were obtained within a single procedure. Results: The csPCa detection rate and overall cancer detection rate (CDR) per patient were comparable among the respective biopsy methods (p > 0.05). Compared with other biopsy methods, a lower clinically insignificant prostate cancer (cisPCa) was detected using COG-TB (p = 0.004). The positive cores percentage ratio (p < 0.001) as well as positive cores containing csPCa percentage ratio (p < 0.001) significantly increased for the targeted biopsy methods. The median maximum cancer core length (MCCL; p = 0.52) as well the median for the MCCL of csPCa (p = 0.47) did not differ significantly among the respective biopsy methods. Concordance of the Gleason scores between biopsy and postprostatectomy pathology did not differ significantly among biopsy methods (p = 0.87).

Neferine is a dibenzyl isoquinoline alkaloid extracted from Nelumbo nucifera and has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-prostate cancer effects. The beneficial therapeutic effects and mechanism of action of neferine in BPH remain unclear. A mouse model of BPH was generated by subcutaneous injection of 7.5 mg/kg testosterone propionate (TP) and 2 or 5 mg/kg neferine was given orally for 14 or 28 days. Pathological and morphological characteristics were evaluated. Prostate weight, prostate index (prostate/body weight ratio), expression of type Ⅱ 5α-reductase, androgen receptor (AR) and prostate specific antigen were all decreased in prostate tissue of BPH mice after administration of neferine. Neferine also downregulated the expression of pro-caspase-3, uncleaved PARP, TGF-β1, TGF-β receptor Ⅱ (TGFBR2), p-Smad2/3, N-cadherin and vimentin. Expression of E-cadherin, cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase-3 was increased by neferine treatment. 1-100 μM neferine with 1 μM testosterone or 10 nM TGF-β1 were added to the culture medium of the normal human prostate stroma cell line, WPMY-1, for 24 h or 48 h. Neferine inhibited cell growth and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in testosterone-treated WPMY-1 cells and regulated the expression of androgen signaling pathway proteins and those related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Moreover, TGF-β1, TGFBR2 and p-Smad2/3, N-cadherin and vimentin expression were increased but E-cadherin was decreased after 24 h TGF-β1 treatment in WPMY-1 cells.

Super enhancers (SE), epigenetic elements, are involved in multiple tumor-promoting signaling pathways. However, the SE-mediated mechanism in mCRPC remains unclear. Methods: SE-associated genes and transcription factors were identified from a cell line (C4-2B) of mCRPC by the CUT&Tag assay. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mCRPC and primary prostate cancer (PCa) samples in the GSE35988 dataset were identified. What's more, a recurrence risk prediction model was constructed based on the overlapping genes (termed SE-associated DEGs). To confirm the key SE-associated DEGs, BET inhibitor JQ1 was applied to cells to block SE-mediated transcription. Finally, single-cell analysis was performed to visualize cell subpopulations expressing the key SE-associated DEGs. Results: Nine human TFs, 867 SE-associated genes and 5417 DEGs were identified. 142 overlapping SE-associated DEGs showed excellent performance in recurrence prediction.

However, developing drug resistance is a significant challenge for achieving effective therapy. This study evaluated the anticancer and synergistic effects on DTX of four natural compounds (calebin A, 3'-hydroxypterostilbene, hispolon, and tetrahydrocurcumin) using PC-3 androgen-resistant human prostate cancer cells. We utilized the CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay and human PC-3 androgen-independent prostate cancer cells to determine the antiproliferative effects of the four compounds alone and combined with DTX. Cytotoxicity to normal human prostate epithelial cells was tested in parallel using normal immortalized human prostate epithelial cells (RWPE-1). We used cell imaging and quantitative caspase-3 activity to determine whether these compounds induce apoptosis. We also measured the capacity of each drug to inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-kB using a colorimetric assay. Our results showed that all four natural compounds significantly augmented the toxicity of DTX to androgen-resistant PC-3 prostate cancer cells at IC50. Interestingly, when used alone, each of the four compounds had a higher cytotoxic activity to PC-3 than DTX. Mechanistically, these compounds induced apoptosis, which we confirmed by cell imaging and caspase-3 colorimetric assays. Further, when used either alone or combined with DTX, the four test compounds inhibited TNF-α-induced NF-kB production. More significantly, the cytotoxic effects on normal immortalized human prostate epithelial cells were minimal and non-significant, suggesting prostate cancer-specific effects. In conclusion, the combination of DTX with the four test compounds could effectively enhance the anti-prostate cancer activity of DTX.

However, it is not known if MI-induced management changes are appropriate. This study aimed to determine if androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) management plan is improved by MI in patients who are candidates for salvage radiation therapy.  Methods:   Data were analyzed from the multicenter prospective PROPS trial evaluating PSMA/Choline PET in patients being considered for salvage radiotherapy (sRT) with BCR after prostatectomy. We compared the pre- and post-MI ADT management plans for each patient and cancer outcomes as predicted by the MSKCC nomogram. A higher percentage of predicted BCR associated with ADT treatment intensification after MI was considered as an improvement in a patient's management.  Results:   Seventy-three patients with a median PSA of 0.38 ng/mL were included. In bivariate analysis, a positive finding on MI (local or metastatic) was associated with decision to use ADT with an odds ratio of 3.67 (95% CI, 1.25 to 10.71; p = 0.02). No factor included in the nomogram was associated with decision to use ADT. Also, MI improved selection of patients to receive ADT based on predicted BCR after sRT : the predicted nomogram 5-year biochemical-free survivals were 52.5% and 43.3%, (mean difference, 9.2%; 95% CI 0.8 to 17.6; p = 0.03) for sRT alone and ADT±sRT subgroups, while there was no statistically significant difference between subgroups before MI.

The inclusion criteria for that study comprised a pretherapeutic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan showing sufficient tumor uptake using a predefined threshold and the absence of 18F-FDG-positive, PSMA ligand-negative tumor lesions. However, the prognostic value of these PET-based inclusion criteria remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of mCRPC patients treated with PSMA RLT using TheraP as well as other TheraP-based PET inclusion criteria. Methods: First, patients were dichotomized into 2 groups whose PSMA PET scans did (TheraP contrast-enhanced PSMA [cePSMA] PET-positive) or did not (TheraP cePSMA PET-negative) fulfill the inclusion criteria of TheraP. Notably, unlike in TheraP, 18F-FDG PET was not performed on our patients. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (PSA decline ≥ 50% from baseline), PSA progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were compared. Additionally, patients were further dichotomized according to predefined SUVmax thresholds different from those used in TheraP to analyze their potential impact on outcome as well. Results: In total, 107 mCRPC patients were included in this analysis (TheraP cePSMA PET-positive, n = 77; TheraP cePSMA PET-negative, n = 30). PSA response rates were higher in TheraP cePSMA PET-positive patients than in TheraP cePSMA PET-negative patients (54.5% vs. 20%, respectively; P = 0.0012). The median PSA progression-free survival (P = 0.007) and OS (P = 0.0007) of patients were significantly longer in the TheraP cePSMA PET-positive group than in the TheraP cePSMA PET-negative group. Moreover, being in the TheraP cePSMA PET-positive group was identified as a significant prognosticator of longer OS (P = 0.003). The application of different SUVmax thresholds for a single hottest lesion demonstrated no influence on outcome in patients eligible for PSMA RLT. Conclusion: Patient selection for PSMA RLT according to the inclusion criteria of TheraP led to a better treatment response and outcome in our preselected patient cohort.

We investigated fat-related and body composition parameters in patients undergoing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed radioligand therapy (RLT) to assess their predictive value for OS. Methods: Body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) and CT-derived body composition parameters (total, subcutaneous, visceral fat area, and psoas muscle area at the L3-L4 level) were determined for 171 patients scheduled for PSMA-directed RLT. After normalization for stature, the psoas muscle index was used to define sarcopenia. Outcome analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression including fat-related and other clinical parameters (Gleason score, C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], hemoglobin, and prostate-specific antigen levels). The Harrell C-index was used for goodness-of-fit analysis. Results: Sixty-five patients (38%) had sarcopenia, and 98 patients (57.3%) had increased BMI. Relative to the 8-mo OS in normal-weight men (BMI < 25), overweight men (25 ≥ BMI > 30) and obese men (BMI ≥ 30) achieved a longer OS of 14 mo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.99; P = 0.03) and 13 mo (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.77; P = 0.004), respectively. Sarcopenia showed no impact on OS (11 vs. 12 mo; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.91-2.1; P = 0.09). Most of the body composition parameters were tightly linked to OS on univariable analyses, with the highest C-index for BMI. In multivariable analysis, a higher BMI (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; P = 0.006), lower CRP (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14; P < 0.001), lower LDH (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14; P < 0.001), and longer interval between initial diagnosis and RLT (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P = 0.02) were significant predictors of OS. Conclusion: Increased fat reserves assessed by BMI, CRP, LDH, and interval between initial diagnosis and RLT, but not CT-derived body composition parameters, were relevant predictors for OS. As BMI can be altered, future research should investigate whether a high-calorie diet before or during PSMA RLT may improve OS.""","""['Philipp E Hartrampf', 'Patrick W Mihatsch', 'Anna Katharina Seitz', 'Lilja B Solnes', 'Steven P Rowe', 'Martin G Pomper', 'Hubert Kübler', 'Thorsten A Bley', 'Andreas K Buck', 'Rudolf A Werner']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nucl Med""","""['Baseline clinical characteristics predict overall survival in patients undergoing radioligand therapy with 177LuLu-PSMA I&T during long-term follow-up.', 'SUVmean on baseline 18FPSMA-1007 PET and clinical parameters are associated with survival in prostate cancer patients scheduled for 177LuLu-PSMA I&T.', 'Pre- and intratherapeutic predictors of overall survival in patients with advanced metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.', 'Visceral adiposity and inflammatory bowel disease.', 'Factors predicting biochemical response and survival benefits following radioligand therapy with 177LuLu-PSMA in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer: a review.']"""

SSA cancer research projects were identified as led by investigators in SSA countries, or by investigators in non-SSA countries with collaborators in SSA, or in database keyword searches.

Results:   A total of 1,846 projects were identified from the ICRP database, funded by 34 organizations in seven countries (only one, Cancer Association of South Africa, based in SSA); only 156 (8%) were led by SSA-based investigators. Most projects focused on virally induced cancers (57%). Across all cancer types, projects were most frequently related to cervical cancer (24%), Kaposi sarcoma (15%), breast cancer (10%), or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (10%). Gaps were observed for several cancers with higher incidence/mortality burden in SSA; for example, prostate cancer accounted for only 4% of projects but 8% of cancer-related deaths and 10% of new cases. Approximately 26% were dedicated to etiology. Treatment-related research declined over the study period (14%-7% of all projects), while projects related to prevention (15%-20%) and diagnosis/prognosis (15%-29%) increased.

Purpose:   This study was performed to evaluate and implement the commercial DLAS software with the incremental retraining function for definitive treatment of patients with prostate cancer in a multi-user environment.  Methods:   CT-based target organs and organs-at-risk (OAR) delineation of 215 prostate cancer patients were utilized. The performance of three commercial DLAS software built-in models was validated with 20 patients. A retrained custom model was developed using 100 patients and evaluated on the remaining data (n = 115). Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), mean surface distance (MSD), and surface DSC (SDSC) were utilized for quantitative evaluation. A multi-rater qualitative evaluation was blindly performed with a five-level scale. Visual inspection was performed in consensus and non-consensus unacceptable cases to identify the failure modes.  Results:   Three commercial DLAS vendor built-in models achieved sub-optimal performance in 20 patients. The retrained custom model had a mean DSC of 0.82 for prostate, 0.48 for seminal vesicles (SV), and 0.92 for rectum, respectively. This represents a significant improvement over the built-in model with DSC of 0.73, 0.37, and 0.81 for the corresponding structures. Compared to the acceptance rate of 96.5% and consensus unacceptable rate (i.e., both reviewers rated as unacceptable) of 3.5% achieved by manual contours, the custom model achieved a 91.3% acceptance rate and 8.7% consensus unacceptable rate.

However, concerns regarding the effects of urinary function following TTh often prevent treatment in hypogonadal men. To explore this further, two population-based single-center, prospective, cumulative registry studies were combined to contribute to a total population of 1176 men with symptoms of hypogonadism. The total population was separated into a TTh group receiving testosterone undecanoate (TU) for up to 12 years and a control group that did not receive treatment. IPSS was recorded at both baseline and at final recorded visit for each patient. Long-term TTh with TU in hypogonadal men resulted in significant improvements in IPSS categories, even in patients with severe symptoms at baseline.

Methods:   Data collected for prostate magnetic resonance imaging included demographic, clinical, scanning, pathology and treatment/management information. Suspicion level on prostate magnetic resonance imaging was correlated with pathology results when available. Outcomes were compared across 3 reporting eras, ie early, mid and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, version 2.  Results:   A total of 537 prostate magnetic resonance images were obtained for diagnosed prostate cancer (60%) or screening (37%).

Thus, we aimed to perform a pan-cancer analysis of the oncogenic and immunological effects of APOF on human cancer.  Methods:   A standardized TCGA pan-cancer dataset was downloaded. Differential expression, clinical prognosis, genetic mutations, immune infiltration, epigenetic modifications, tumor stemness and heterogeneity were analyzed. We conducted all analyses through software R (version 3.6.3) and its suitable packages.  Results:   Overall, we found that the common cancers differentially expressed between tumor and normal samples and prognostic-associated were BRCA, PRAD, KIRP, and LIHC in terms of overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The pan-cancer Spearman analysis showed that the mRNA expression of APOF was negatively correlated with four tumor stemness indexes (DMPss, DNAss, ENHss, and EREG-METHss) with statistical significance for PRAD and was positively correlated for LIHC. In terms of BRCA and PRAD patients, we found negative correlation of APOF with TMB, MSI, neo, HRD and LOH. The mutation frequencies of BRCA and LIHC were 0.3%. APOF expression was negatively correlated with immune infiltration and positively correlated with tumor purity for PRAD patients. The mRNA expression of APOF was negatively associated with most TILs for LIHC, B cells, CD4+ T cells, neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells, but was positively associated with CD8+ T cells.

GW-PRS models were trained with a large and diverse prostate cancer GWAS of 107,247 cases and 127,006 controls that we previously used to develop the multi-ancestry PRS269. Resulting models were independently tested in 1,586 cases and 1,047 controls of African ancestry from the California Uganda Study and 8,046 cases and 191,825 controls of European ancestry from the UK Biobank and further validated in 13,643 cases and 210,214 controls of European ancestry and 6,353 cases and 53,362 controls of African ancestry from the Million Veteran Program. In the testing data, the best performing GW-PRS approach had AUCs of 0.656 (95% CI = 0.635-0.677) in African and 0.844 (95% CI = 0.840-0.848) in European ancestry men and corresponding prostate cancer ORs of 1.83 (95% CI = 1.67-2.00) and 2.19 (95% CI = 2.14-2.25), respectively, for each SD unit increase in the GW-PRS.

During metastasis, the pathological role of ERG is associated with cell proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that miRNAs regulate ERG expression through its 3'UTR. Several bioinformatics tools were used to identify miRNAs and their binding sites on 3'UTR of ERG. The selected miRNAs expression was analyzed in prostate cancer samples by qPCR. The miRNAs overexpression was induced in prostate cancer cells (VCaP) to analyze ERG expression. Reporter gene assay was performed to evaluate the ERG activity in response to selected miRNAs. The expression of ERG downstream target genes was also investigated through qPCR after miRNAs overexpression. To observe the effects of selected miRNAs on cell proliferation and migration, scratch assay was performed to calculate the cell migration rate. miR-4482 and miR-3912 were selected from bioinformatics databases. miR-4482 and -3912 expression were decreased in prostate cancer samples, as compared to controls (p<0.05 and p<0.001), respectively. Overexpression of miR-4482 and miR-3912 significantly reduced ERG mRNA (p<0.001 and p<0.01), respectively) and protein (p<0.01) in prostate cancer cells.

Although studies have shown in vitro antitumor effects of cucurbitacins from Cucumis sativus, the in vivo anticancer effect of the seed oil as a whole, has yet to be demonstrated. The present study evaluated the in vitro anticancer mechanisms of C. sativus (CS) seed oil and its possible chemopreventive potential on benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-induced PCa in Wistar rat. In vitro cell growth, clone formation, cell death mechanism, cell adhesion and migration as well as expression of integrins β-1 and β-4 were assessed. In vivo PCa was induced in 56 male rats versus 8 normal control rats, randomized in normal (NOR) and negative (BaP) control groups which, received distilled water; the positive control group (Caso) was treated with casodex (13.5 mg/kg BW). One group received the total seed extract at the dose of 500 mg/kg BW; while the remaining three groups were treated with CS seed oil at 42.5, 85, and 170 mg/kg BW. The endpoints were: morphologically (prostate tumor weight and volume), biochemically (total protein, prostate specific antigen (PSA), oxidative stress markers such as MDA, GSH, catalase, and SOD) and histologically. As results, CS seed oil significantly and concentration-dependently reduced the DU145 prostate cancer cell growth and clone formation (optimum = 100 μg/mL). It slightly increased the number of apoptotic cells and inhibited the migration and invasion of DU145 cells, while it decreased their adhesion to immobilized collagen and fibrinogen. The expression of integrin β-1 and β-4 was increased in presence of 100 μg/mL CS oil. In vivo, the BaP significantly elevated the incidence of PC tumors (75%), the total protein and PSA levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6) and MDA levels compared to NOR. CS seeds oil significantly counteracted the effect of BaP by decreasing significantly the PC incidence (12.5%), and increasing the level of antioxidant (SOD, GSH, and catalase) and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in serum. While in BaP group PCa adenocarninoma was the most representative neoplasm, rats treated with 85 and 170 mg/kg prevented it in the light of the casodex. It is conclude that CS may provide tumor suppressive effects in vitro and in vivo which makes it an interesting candidate to support the current treatment protocol.""","""['Berlise Yengwa Bakam', 'Judith Christiane Ngo Pambe', 'Timothy Grey', 'Sebastian Maxeiner', 'Jochen Rutz', 'Dieudonne Njamen', 'Roman A Blaheta', 'Stéphane Zingue']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Environ Toxicol""","""['Breast cancer cell growth arrest and chemopreventive effects of Passiflora edulis Sims (Passifloraceae) ethanolic leaves extract on a rat model of mammary carcinoma.', 'Role of NF-κB p65 and related cytokines in rats with liver function injury induced by dibutyl phthalate and benzo (a) pyrene.', 'Comparison of the Anti-inflammatory Effects of Proanthocyanidin, Quercetin, and Damnacanthal on Benzo(a)pyrene Exposed A549 Alveolar Cell Line.', 'Curcumin, an Active Constituent of Turmeric Spice: Implication in the Prevention of Lung Injury Induced by Benzo(a) Pyrene (BaP) in Rats.', 'In vitro modulation of tumor progression-associated properties of hormone refractory prostate carcinoma cell lines by cytokines.']"""

This study aims to identify novel predictive circulating biomarkers significantly associated with surgical complications.  Methods:   We consecutively assessed all multiport robotic-assisted radical prostatectomies performed between 2021 and 2022. The clinicopathological factors and perioperative levels of multiple circulating markers were retrospectively obtained from the included patients. The associations of these indices with Clavien-Dindo grade II or greater complications, and surgical site infection were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Further, the models were validated for the overall performance, discrimination, and calibration.  Results:   In total, 229 patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in this study. Prolonged operative time could independently predict surgical site infection (OR, 3.39; 95% CI, 1.09-10.54). Higher RBC (day 1-pre) implied lower risks of grade II or greater complications (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.07-0.76) and surgical site infection (OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.07-0.78). Additionally, RBC (day 1-pre) independently predicted grade II or greater complications of obese patients (P value = 0.005) as well as those in higher NCCN risk groups (P value = 0.012). Regarding the inflammatory markers, NLR (day 1-pre) (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.37-9.21) and CRP (day 1-pre) (OR, 4.16; 95% CI, 1.69-10.23) were significantly associated with the risk of grade II or greater complications, and both the indices were independent predictors in those with higher Gleason score, or in higher NCCN risk groups (P value < 0.05).

Included patients had received docetaxel and ≤ 1 year of an ARAT (abiraterone or enzalutamide) prior to receiving cabazitaxel or an alternative ARAT, as their third-line therapy. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the time to treatment failure (TTF) of the third-line therapy. Patients were matched (1:1) from the cabazitaxel and second ARAT arms based on propensity score (PS).  Results:   Of the 535 patients analysed, 247 received cabazitaxel and 288 the alternative ARAT as their third-line therapy, of which, 91.3% (n = 263/288) received abiraterone and 8.7% (n = 25/288) received enzalutamide as their second third-line ARAT.

Initial cabazitaxel dose was ≤ 20 mg/m2 in 61.9% (n = 153/247) of the patients in the cabazitaxel arm. The median TTF (95% confidence interval [CI]) of the third-line therapy was 109 (94-128) days for cabazitaxel and 58 (57-66) days for the second ARAT, with a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 0.339 (0.279-0.413) favouring cabazitaxel.

The use of intra-prostatic fiducial markers (FM) for image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) has become widespread due to their accuracy, relatively safe use, low cost, and reproducibility. FM provides a tool to monitor prostate position and volume changes. Many studies reported low to moderate rates of complications following FM implantation. In the current study, we present our five years' experience regarding the insertion technique, technical success, and rates of complication and migration of intraprostatic insertion of FM gold marker.  Methods:   From January 2018 to January 2023, 795 patients with prostate cancer candidate for IGRT (with or without a history of radical prostatectomy) enrolled in this study. We used three fiducial markers (3*0.6 mm) inserted through an 18-gauge Chiba needle under transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) guidance. The patients were observed for complications up to seven days after the procedure. Besides, the rate of marker migration was recorded.  Results:   All procedures were completed successfully, and all patients tolerated the procedure well with minimal discomfort. The rate of sepsis after the procedure was 1%, and transient urinary obstruction was 1.6%. Only two patients experienced marker migration shortly after insertion, and no fiducial migration was reported throughout radiotherapy. No other major complication was recorded.  Discussion:   TRUS-guided intraprostatic FM implantation is technically feasible, safe, and well-tolerated in most patients. The FM migration can seldom occur, with negligible effects. This study can provide convincing evidence that TRUS-guided intra-prostatic FM insertion is an appropriate choice for IGRT.""","""['Ali Mahdavi', 'Bahram Mofid', 'Farzad Taghizadeh-Hesary']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Med Imaging""","""['Ultrasound-guided transrectal implantation of fiducial markers for image-guided radiotherapy of prostate cancer without local anesthesia: Patient-reported gastrointestinal-genitourinary system complications and pain.', 'Fiducial markers implantation for prostate image-guided radiotherapy: a report on the transperineal approach.', 'Fiducial marker implantation in prostate radiation therapy: complication rates and technique.', 'Fiducial marker guided prostate radiotherapy: a review.', 'A review of the use of fiducial markers for image-guided bladder radiotherapy.']"""

Results:   We observed significant reductions in diagnoses of breast cancer (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-0.76), prostate cancer (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56-0.73) and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.64, 95% CI 0.56- 0.74) and melanoma (IRR 0.57, 95% CI 0.47-0.69) during the state of emergency period compared with the period before it. These decreases largely occurred among early-stage rather than late-stage diagnoses. Patients who received a diagnosis of colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and uterine cancer in 2020 had lower 1-year survival than those diagnosed in 2018; no other cancer sites had lower survival.  Interpretation:   The results from our analyses suggest that health care disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Alberta considerably affected cancer outcomes.

Latest studies have confirmed that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a crucial role in a variety of cancers. Some of these lncRNAs code for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), called small nucleolar RNA host genes (SNHGs), which exert some value in predicting the prognosis of certain cancer patients, but little is known regarding the function of SNHGs within the PCa.  Aim of the study:   To explore the expression distribution and differential analysis of SNHGs in different tumors using RNA-seq and survival data from TCGA and GTEx, and to assess the potential impacts of the lncRNA SNHG25 on human PCa. To validate the expression of SNHG25 using experimental data and to investigate in detail its particular molecular biological function on PCa both in vivo and in vitro.  Methods:   LncRNA SNHG25 expression was analyzed by bioinformatic prediction and qPCR. CCK-8, EdU, transwell, wound healing, and western blotting assays were conducted to investigate the main role of lncRNA SNHG25 in PCa. Xenograft tumour growth model in nude mice was surveyed by in vivo imaging and Ki-67 staining. AKT pathway activator (SC79) was used to verify the interaction among SNHG25 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.  Results:   Bioinformatics analysis and experimental research illuminated that the expression of lncRNA SNHG25 was observably up-regulated in PCa tissues and cells. Moreover, SNHG25 knockdown restrained PCa cell proliferation, invasion and migration, while promoting apoptosis. Xenografts model confirmed that the si-SNHG25 group had a significant inhibitory effect on PCa tumour growth in vivo. Additionally, a series of gain-of-function analyses suggested that SNHG25 could activate the PI3K/AKT pathway to accelerate PCa progression.  Conclusions:   These in vitro and in vivo findings demonstrate that SNHG25 is highly expressed in PCa and facilitates PCa development through regulation of PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. SNHG25 acts as an oncogene to predict tumour malignancy and survival in PCa patients and may therefore become a promising potential molecular target for early detection and therapy of lethal PCa.""","""['Zelin Liu', 'Shuai Ke', 'Qinghua Wang', 'Xuhang Gu', 'Guanzhong Zhai', 'Haoren Shao', 'Mu He', 'Jia Guo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Exp Cell Res""","""['LncRNA SNHG25 predicts poor prognosis and promotes progression in osteosarcoma via the miR-497-5p/SOX4 axis.', 'SNHG25 facilitates SNORA50C accumulation to stabilize HDAC1 in neuroblastoma cells.', 'Small nucleolar RNA host gene 25 is a long non-coding RNA helps diagnose and predict outcomes in prostate cancer.', 'LncRNA SNHG25 Promotes Glioma Progression Through Activating MAPK Signaling.', 'Long Non-Coding Small Nucleolar RNA Host Genes (SNHGs) in Endocrine-Related Cancers.']"""

However, deep-learning algorithms trained on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole slide images (WSI) may outperform the human eye and help to screen for clinically-relevant genomic alterations. We created deep-learning algorithms to identify prostate tumors with underlying ETS-related gene (ERG) fusions or PTEN deletions using the following 4 stages: (1) automated tumor identification, (2) feature representation learning, (3) classification, and (4) explainability map generation. A novel transformer-based hierarchical architecture was trained on a single representative WSI of the dominant tumor nodule from a radical prostatectomy (RP) cohort with known ERG/PTEN status (n = 224 and n = 205, respectively). Two distinct vision transformer-based networks were used for feature extraction, and a distinct transformer-based model was used for classification. The ERG algorithm performance was validated across 3 RP cohorts, including 64 WSI from the pretraining cohort (AUC, 0.91) and 248 and 375 WSI from 2 independent RP cohorts (AUC, 0.86 and 0.89, respectively). In addition, we tested the ERG algorithm performance in 2 needle biopsy cohorts comprised of 179 and 148 WSI (AUC, 0.78 and 0.80, respectively). Focusing on cases with homogeneous (clonal) PTEN status, PTEN algorithm performance was assessed using 50 WSI reserved from the pretraining cohort (AUC, 0.81), 201 and 337 WSI from 2 independent RP cohorts (AUC, 0.72 and 0.80, respectively), and 151 WSI from a needle biopsy cohort (AUC, 0.75). For explainability, the PTEN algorithm was also applied to 19 WSI with heterogeneous (subclonal) PTEN loss, where the percentage tumor area with predicted PTEN loss correlated with that based on immunohistochemistry (r = 0.58, P = .0097).

If the family history of the patient includes familial cancers, the patient and family members should be referred for genetic counseling and testing for cancer-associated sequence variants. Prostate cancer treatments have significant long-term effects. After radical prostatectomy, 27% to 29% of patients experience urinary incontinence and 66% to 70% have erectile dysfunction. These effects also can occur after radiation therapy, though at lower rates. Mild urinary incontinence can be managed with incontinence pads. The most effective treatments are artificial urinary sphincter implantation and urethral sling procedure. Urinary incontinence after radiation therapy tends to decrease over time. Symptoms of urinary urgency or nocturia can be managed with anticholinergic drugs. Erectile dysfunction typically is managed with oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and/or vacuum pump erectile devices. Androgen deprivation therapy increases cardiovascular risk by increasing insulin resistance and blood pressure.

Methods:   Overall, 43 radical prostatectomy specimens from PCa patients who had undergone nADT were collected. Multiparameter variables were analyzed by univariate and then multivariate logistic analyses to identify the independent prognostic factors for predicting BCR. The predictive model was established using Lasso regression analysis.  Results:   Univariate logistic analysis revealed six variables, pathology stage; margins; categorization as group A, B, or C; nucleolus grading; percentage of tumor involvement (PTI); and PTEN status were significantly associated with the BCR of PCa (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis suggested that categorization as group C, severe nucleolus grading, PTI less than or equal to 5%, and PTEN loss were positively correlated with BCR (all p < 0.05). A nomogram comprising the four variables predicting BCR was constructed, and it exhibited good discrimination (AUC: 0.985; specificity: 86.2%; sensitivity: 100%). Calibration plots for the probability of freedom from BCR at 1 and 2 years showed a good match between the prediction by the nomogram.

Loss of the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) has been linked to poor survival in prostate cancer. We have recently shown that PTEN loss is evident in approximately 60% of prostate cancer cases in Jordan. However, the correlation between PTEN loss and response to ADT remains unclear. This study aimed to determine the relationship between PTEN loss and time to CRPC in Jordan. We conducted a retrospective analysis of confirmed CRPC cases at our institution from 2005 to 2019 (N=104). PTEN expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Time to CRPC was calculated from the initiation of ADT to the confirmed diagnosis of CRPC. Combination/sequential ADT was defined as the use of two or more classes of ADT concomitantly or switching from one class to another. We found that PTEN loss was evident in 60.6% of CRPC. Mean time to CRPC was not different between patients with PTEN loss (24.8 months) and those with intact PTEN (24.2 months; p=0.9). However, patients receiving combination/sequential ADT had a significantly delayed onset of CRPC compared to patients on monotherapy ADT (log-rank Mantel-Cox p=0.000).

Their partially common metabolism may constitute the base of their similar epidemiology.  Objective:   Proving metabolic relation between glycaemic and nutritional status and progression of cancers, as well as confirming the antitumor effect of non-insulin antidiabetics, primarily metformin.  Method:   We processed the data of 1224 patients treated at the Oncology Center in county Békés. We examined the progression of cancers depending on body mass index, blood glucose levels, the presence and therapy of type 2 diabetes, over and above analyzed changes in glycemic and nutritional status in relation to tumor stage, further more prevalence of diabetes mellitus.  Results:   Despite of malignant cachexy, we found obesity or corresponding body mass index in relatively high rate (23.28%) more often associated with metastatic stage. We detected higher rate of type 2 diabetes (20.34%) compared to average population. We found even larger scale of diabetes among patients suffering from primary hepatocellular (60%, p<0.001), pancreatic (50%, p<0.001), urinary bladder (50%, p<0.001), prostate (50%, p<0.002), endometrial (50%, p<0.02) and postmenopausal breast cancer (30%, p<0.006), compared to other part of the studied population. Patients treated by non-insulin antidiabetics, taking metformin was accompanied by the lowest incidence of metastatic stage, the highest body mass index and blood glucose level.  Discussion:   In our study, the order of malignant diseases most frequently associated with type-2 diabetes correspond to previously published literature data. Development of insulin resistance accompanied by tumor progression can be effectively delayed by antimetabolic medicines. The combined antimetastatic effect of metformin could achieve glucose and weight control independently.  Conclusion:   Based on our results, targeted screening for cancer among diabetic patients, and seeking and adequately treating glycometabolic disorders with concomitant malignant conditions, respectively , are suggested, mainly using metformin and new non-insulin antidiabetic medicines. Through these efforts, the fight against cancer can be more effective.

We used multivariable linear regression to determine associations of the indices, derived from baseline food-frequency questionnaires (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial: 1993-2001, Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study: 1985-1988) with serum concentrations of 904 lipid species and 252 fatty acids (FAs) across 15 lipid classes and 28 total FAs, within each cohort and meta-analyzed results using fixed-effect models for lipids significant at Bonferroni-corrected threshold in common in both cohorts.  Results:   Adherence to HEI-2015, AHEI-2010, or aMED was associated positively with 31, 41, and 54 lipid species and 8, 6, and 10 class-specific FAs and inversely with 2, 8, and 34 lipid species and 1, 3, and 5 class-specific FAs, respectively. Twenty-five lipid species and 5 class-specific FAs were common to all indices, predominantly triacylglycerols, FA22:6 [docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]-containing species, and DHA. All indices were positively associated with total FA22:6. AHEI-2010 and aMED were inversely associated with total FA18:1 (oleic acid) and total FA17:0 (margaric acid), respectively. The identified lipids were most associated with components of seafood and plant proteins and unsaturated:saturated fat ratio in HEI-2015; eicosapentaenoic acid plus DHA in AHEI-2010; and fish and monounsaturated:saturated fat ratio in aMED.  Conclusions:   Adherence to HEI-2015, AHEI-2010, and aMED is associated with serum lipidomic profiles, mostly triacylglycerols or FA22:6-containing species, which are related to seafood and plant proteins, eicosapentaenoic acid-DHA, fish, or fat ratio index components.""","""['Ting Zhang', 'Sabine Naudin', 'Hyokyoung G Hong', 'Demetrius Albanes', 'Satu Männistö', 'Stephanie J Weinstein', 'Steven C Moore', 'Rachael Z Stolzenberg-Solomon']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Nutr""","""[]"""

Through high-resolution genome-wide single-cell DNA methylation sequencing, we identify 40 core domains that are uniformly hypomethylated from the earliest detectable stages of prostate malignancy through metastatic circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Nested among these repressive domains are smaller loci with preserved methylation that escape silencing and are enriched for cell proliferation genes. Transcriptionally silenced genes within the core hypomethylated domains are enriched for immune-related genes; prominent among these is a single gene cluster harboring all five CD1 genes that present lipid antigens to NKT cells and four IFI16-related interferon-inducible genes implicated in innate immunity. The re-expression of CD1 or IFI16 murine orthologs in immuno-competent mice abrogates tumorigenesis, accompanied by the activation of anti-tumor immunity. Thus, early epigenetic changes may shape tumorigenesis, targeting co-located genes within defined chromosomal loci.

Additionally, we assessed whether there was an added benefit of metastasis-directed therapy (MDT) in these patients in the adjuvant setting.  Methods:   Overall, 68 patients with omPCa (≤ 5 skeletal lesions at conventional imaging) treated with RP and pelvic lymph node dissection between 2006 and 2022 were included. Additional therapies (androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] and MDT) were administered according to the treating physicians' judgment. MDT was defined as metastasis surgery/radiotherapy within 6 months of RP. We assessed Clinical Progression (CP), Biochemical Recurrence (BCR), post-operative complications and overall mortality (OM) of RP and the impact of adjuvant MDT + ADT versus RP + ADT alone.  Results:   Median follow-up was 73 months (IQR 62-89). RARP reduced the risk of severe complications after adjusting for age and CCI (OR 0.15; p = 0.02). After RP, 68% patients were continent. Median 90-days PSA after RP was 0.12 ng/dL. CP and OM-free survival at 7 years were 50% and 79%, respectively.

However, it remains difficult to select eligible candidates. We herein examined eligibility factors for hemi-ablative FT for prostate cancer.  Methods:   We identified 412 patients who were diagnosed with unilateral prostate cancer by biopsy and had undergone radical prostatectomy between 2009 and 2018. Among these patients, 111 underwent MRI before biopsy, had 10-20 core biopsies performed, and did not receive other treatments before surgery. Fifty-seven patients with prostate-specific antigen ≥ 15 ng/mL and biopsy Gleason score (GS) ≥ 4 + 3 were excluded. The remaining 54 patients were evaluated. Both lobes of the prostate were scored using Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 on MRI. Ineligible patients for FT were defined as those with ≥ 0.5 mL GS6 or GS ≥ 3 + 4 in the biopsy-negative lobe, ≥ pT3, or lymph node involvement. Selected predictors of eligibility for hemi-ablative FT were analyzed.  Results:   Among our cohort of 54 patients, 29 (53.7%) were eligible for hemi-ablative FT. A multivariate analysis identified a PI-RADS score < 3 in the biopsy-negative lobe (p = 0.016) as an independent predictor of eligibility for FT. Thirteen out of 25 ineligible patients had GS ≥ 3 + 4 tumors in the biopsy-negative lobe, half of whom (6/13) also had a PI-RADS score < 3 in the biopsy-negative lobe.

Exercise during cancer reduces treatment-related side effects and provide a stimulus to mobilize and redistribute immune cells. However, it is unclear how conventional and unconventional T cells (UTC) respond to acute exercise in prostate cancer survivors compared to healthy controls.  Methods:   Age-matched prostate cancer survivors on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and those without ADT (PCa) along with non-cancer controls (CON) completed ∼45 min of intermittent cycling with 3 min at 60% of peak power interspersed by 1.5 min of rest. Fresh, unstimulated immune cell populations and intracellular perforin were assessed before (baseline), immediately following (0 h), 2 h, and 24 h post-exercise.  Results:   At 0 h, conventional T cell counts increased by 45%-64% with no differences between groups. T cell frequency decreased by -3.5% for CD3+ and -4.5% for CD4+ cells relative to base at 0 h with CD8+ cells experiencing a delayed decrease of -4.5% at 2 h with no group differences. Compared to CON, the frequency of CD8+CD57+ cells was -18.1% lower in ADT. Despite a potential decrease in maturity, ADT increased CD8+perforin+ GMFI. CD3+Vα7.2+CD161+ counts, but not frequencies, increased by 69% post-exercise while CD3+CD56+ cell counts increased by 127% and were preferentially mobilized (+1.7%) immediately following the acute cycling bout. There were no UTC group differences. Cell counts and frequencies returned to baseline by 24 h.  Conclusion:   Following acute exercise, prostate cancer survivors demonstrate normal T cell and UTC responses that were comparable to CON. Independent of exercise, ADT is associated with lower CD8+ cell maturity (CD57) and perforin frequency that suggests a less mature phenotype. However, higher perforin GMFI may attenuate these changes, with the functional implications of this yet to be determined.""","""['Erik D Hanson', 'Samy Sakkal', 'Lauren C Bates-Fraser', 'Shadney Que', 'Eunhan Cho', 'Guillaume Spielmann', 'Elif Kadife', 'John A Violet', 'Claudio L Battaglini', 'Lee Stoner', 'David B Bartlett', 'Glenn K McConell', 'Alan Hayes']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Sports Act Living""","""[]"""

Its low toxicity profile favors use in elderly patients or in patients with critical comorbidities. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of [177Lu]-PSMA RLT in mCRPC patients at least 80 y old. Methods: Eighty mCRPC patients at least 80 y old underwent [177Lu]-PSMA-I&T RLT and were retrospectively selected. The patients were previously treated by androgen receptor-directed therapy, received taxane-based chemotherapy, or were chemotherapy-ineligible. The best prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was calculated, as well as clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) and overall survival (OS). Toxicity data were acquired until 6 mo after the last treatment cycle. Results: Of 80 patients, 49 (61.3%) were chemotherapy-naïve and 16 (20%) had visceral metastases. The median number of previous mCRPC treatment regimens was 2. In total, 324 cycles (median, 4 cycles; range, 1-12) with a median cumulative activity of 23.8 GBq (interquartile range, 14.8-42.2) were applied. A PSA decline of 50% was achieved in 37 (46.3%) patients. Chemotherapy-naïve patients showed higher 50% PSA response rates than chemotherapy-pretreated patients (51.0% vs. 38.7%, respectively). Overall, median cPFS and OS were 8.7 and 16.1 mo, respectively. The median cPFS and OS of chemotherapy-naïve patients were significantly longer than those of chemotherapy-pretreated patients (10.5 vs. 6.5 mo and 20.7 vs. 11.8 mo, respectively, P < 0.05). A lower hemoglobin level and higher lactate dehydrogenase level at baseline were independent predictors of shorter cPFS and OS. Treatment-emergent grade 3 toxicities were anemia in 4 patients (5%), thrombocytopenia in 3 patients (3.8%), and renal impairment in 4 patients (5%). No nonhematologic grade 3 and no grade 4 toxicities were observed. The most frequent clinical side effects were grade 1-2 xerostomia, fatigue, and inappetence.

Serum lipoprotein (a) levels vary widely by genetic backgrounds and are largely determined by the genetic variations of apolipoprotein (a) gene, LPA. In this study, we investigate the association between SNPs in LPA region and cancer incidence and mortality in Japanese.  Methods:   A genetic cohort study was conducted utilizing the data from 9923 participants in the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study (JPHC Study). Twenty-five SNPs in the LPAL2-LPA region were selected from the genome-wide genotyped data. Cox regression analysis adjusted for the covariates and competing risks of death from other causes, were used to estimate the relative risk (hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) of overall and site-specific cancer incidence and mortality, for each SNP.  Results:   No significant association was found between SNPs in the LPAL2-LPA region and cancer incidence or mortality (overall/site-specific cancer). In men, however, HRs for stomach cancer incidence of 18SNPs were estimated higher than 1.5 (e.g., 2.15 for rs13202636, model free, 95%CI: 1.28-3.62) and those for stomach cancer mortality of 2SNPs (rs9365171, rs1367211) were estimated 2.13 (recessive, 95%CI:1.04-4.37) and 1.61 (additive, 95%CI: 1.00-2.59). Additionally, the minor allele for SNP rs3798220 showed increased death risk from colorectal cancer (CRC) in men (HR: 3.29, 95% CI:1.59 - 6.81) and decreased CRC incidence risk in women (HR: 0.46, 95%CI: 0.22-0.94).

In prostate cancer (PCa) cells, LCN2 regulates distinct phenotypic features, including cytoskeleton organization and expression of inflammation mediators. Oncolytic virotherapy uses oncolytic viruses (OVs) to kill cancer cells and induce anti-tumor immunity. A main source of specificity of OVs towards tumor cells stems from cancer-induced defects in interferon (IFN)-based cell autonomous immune responses. However, the molecular underpinnings of such defects in PCa cells are only partially understood. Moreover, LCN2 effects on IFN responses of PCa cells and their susceptibility to OVs are unknown. To examine these issues, we queried gene expression databases for genes coexpressed with LCN2, revealing co-expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and LCN2. Analysis of human PCa cells revealed correlated expression of LCN2 and subsets of IFNs and ISGs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated stable knockout of LCN2 in PC3 cells or transient overexpression of LCN2 in LNCaP cells revealed LCN2-mediated regulation of IFNE (and IFNL1) expression, activation of JAK/STAT pathway, and expression of selected ISGs. Accordingly, and dependent on a functional JAK/STAT pathway, LCN2 reduced the susceptibility of PCa cells to infection with the IFN-sensitive OV, EHDV-TAU. In PC3 cells, LCN2 knockout increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (p-eIF2α). Inhibition of PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) in PC3-LCN2-KO cells reduced p-eIF2α while increasing constitutive IFNE expression, phosphorylation of STAT1, and ISG expression; and decreasing EHDV-TAU infection. Together, these data propose that LCN2 regulates PCa susceptibility to OVs through attenuation of PERK activity and increased IFN and ISG expression.""","""['Lilach Barer', 'Sarah K Schröder', 'Ralf Weiskirchen', 'Eran Bacharach', 'Marcelo Ehrlich']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Cell Biol""","""[]"""

Using results from the European Society of Radiation Oncology's (ESTRO) Global Impact of Radiotherapy in Oncology (GIRO) initiative survey on hypofractionation, this study identifies rates of adoption, facilitating factors, and barriers to adoption of hypofractionation in prostate cancer across World Bank income groups.  Materials and methods:   The ESTRO-GIRO initiative administered an international, anonymous, electronic survey to radiation oncologists from 2018 to 2019. Physician demographics, clinical practice characteristics, and hypofractionation regimen use (if any) for several prostate cancer scenarios were collected. Responders were asked about specific justifications and barriers to adopting hypofractionation, and responses were stratified by World Bank income group. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to analyze variables associated with hypofractionation preference.  Results:   A total of 1,157 physician responses were included. Most respondents (60%) were from high-income countries (HICs). In the curative setting, hypofractionation was most often preferred in low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancers, with 52% and 47% of respondents reporting hypofractionation use in ≥50% of patients, respectively. These rates drop to 35% and 20% in high-risk prostate cancer and where pelvic irradiation is indicated. Most respondents (89%) preferred hypofractionation in the palliative setting. Overall, respondents from upper-middle-income countries and lower-middle- and low-income countries were significantly less likely to prefer hypofractionation than those from HICs (P < .001). The most frequently cited justification and barrier were availability of published evidence and fear of worse late toxicity, respectively.  Conclusion:   Hypofractionation preference varies by indication and World Bank income group, with greater acceptance among providers in HICs for all indications.

Spheroids, a complex three-dimensional (3D) structure, more closely resemble in vivo tumor growth. Spheroids allow the results obtained relating to proliferation, cell death, differentiation, metabolism, and various antitumor therapies to be more predictive of in vivo outcomes. In the protocol herein, a rapid and high-throughput method is discussed for the generation of single spheroids using various cancer cell lines, including brain cancer cells (U87 MG, SEBTA-027, SF188), prostate cancer cells (DU-145, TRAMP-C1), and breast cancer cells (BT-549, Py230) in 96-round bottom-well plates. The proposed method is associated with significantly low costs per plate without requiring refining or transferring. Homogeneous compact spheroid morphology was evidenced as early as 1 day after following this protocol. Proliferating cells were traced in the rim, while dead cells were found to be located inside the core region of the spheroid using confocal microscopy and the Incucyte® live imaging system. H&E staining of spheroid sections was utilized to investigate the tightness of the cell packaging. Through western blotting analyses, it was revealed that a stem cell-like phenotype was adopted by these spheroids. This method was also used to obtain the EC50 of the anticancer dipeptide carnosine on U87 MG 3D culture.

The six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) protein is overexpressed in several types of human tumors, particularly in PCa. Our research group has demonstrated that STEAP1 overexpression is associated with PCa progression and aggressiveness. Therefore, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms triggered by STEAP1 overexpression will provide important insights to delineate new strategies for PCa treatment. In the present work, a proteomic strategy was used to characterize the intracellular signaling pathways and the molecular targets downstream of STEAP1 in PCa cells. A label-free approach was applied using an Orbitrap LC-MS/MS system to characterize the proteome of STEAP1-knockdown PCa cells. More than 6700 proteins were identified, of which a total of 526 proteins were found differentially expressed in scramble siRNA versus STEAP1 siRNA (234 proteins up-regulated and 292 proteins down-regulated). Bioinformatics analysis allowed us to explore the mechanism through which STEAP1 exerts influence on PCa, revealing that endocytosis, RNA transport, apoptosis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, and metabolic pathways are the main biological processes where STEAP1 is involved. By immunoblotting, it was confirmed that STEAP1 silencing induced the up-regulation of cathepsin B, intersectin-1, and syntaxin 4, and the down-regulation of HRas, PIK3C2A, and DIS3. These findings suggested that blocking STEAP1 might be a suitable strategy to activate apoptosis and endocytosis, and diminish cellular metabolism and intercellular communication, leading to inhibition of PCa progression.""","""['Sandra M Rocha', 'Fátima M Santos', 'Sílvia Socorro', 'Luís A Passarinha', 'Cláudio J Maia']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res""","""['Knockdown of STEAP1 inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in LNCaP prostate cancer cells counteracting the effect of androgens.', 'STEAP1 regulation and its influence modulating the response of LNCaP prostate cancer cells to bicalutamide, enzalutamide and apalutamide.', 'STEAP1 Knockdown Decreases the Sensitivity of Prostate Cancer Cells to Paclitaxel, Docetaxel and Cabazitaxel.', 'Targeting STEAP1 Protein in Human Cancer: Current Trends and Future Challenges.', 'STEAP1-4 (Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of the Prostate 1-4) and Their Clinical Implications for Prostate Cancer.']"""

Additionally, mutagens also affect cancer risk, for instance, high-dose radiation exposure increases lifetime cancer risk. However, the influence of low-dose radiation exposure is still unclear because this influence, if any, is very slight. We can assess the minimal influence of the mutagen by virtually comparing the states with and without mutagen using a mathematical model. Here, we constructed a mathematical model to assess the influence of replication errors and mutagens on cancer risk. In our model, replication errors occur with a certain probability during cell division. Mutagens cause mutations at a constant rate. Cell division is arrested when the number of cells reaches the capacity of the cell pool. When the number of cells decreases because of cell death or other reasons, cells resume division. It was assumed that the mutations of cancer driver genes occur stochastically with each mutation and that cancer occurs when the number of cancer driver gene mutations exceeds a certain threshold. We approximated the number of mutations caused by errors and mutagens. Then, we examined whether cancer registry data on cancer risk can be explained only through replication errors. Although the risk of leukemia was not fitted to the model, the risks of esophageal, liver, thyroid, pancreatic, colon, breast, and prostate cancers were explained only by replication errors. Even if the risk was explained by replication errors, the estimated parameters did not always agree with previously reported values. For example, the estimated number of cancer driver genes in lung cancer was larger than the previously reported values. This discrepancy can be partly resolved by assuming the influence of mutagen. First, the influence of mutagens was analyzed using various parameters. The model predicted that the influence of mutagens will appear earlier, when the turnover rate of the tissue is higher and fewer mutations of cancer driver genes were necessary for carcinogenesis. Next, the parameters of lung cancer were re-estimated assuming the influence of mutagens. The estimated parameters were closer to the previously reported values. than when considering only replication errors. Although it may be useful to explain cancer risk by replication errors, it would be biologically more plausible to consider mutagens in cancers in which the effects of mutagens are apparent.""","""['Kouki Uchinomiya', 'Masanori Tomita']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""['Mathematical models of tissue stem and transit target cell divisions and the risk of radiation- or smoking-associated cancer.', 'Folic acid supplementation and malaria susceptibility and severity among people taking antifolate antimalarial drugs in endemic areas.', 'Cancer etiology: Variation in cancer risk among tissues is poorly explained by the number of gene mutations.', 'Chromosomal mutagen sensitivity associated with mutations in BRCA genes.', 'The stem cell division theory of cancer.']"""

During treatment the gastrointestinal tract may be exposed to radiation and the rectal wall may be exposed to high doses of ionizing radiation, which can lead to rectal bleeding, ulcers or fistulas, and an increased risk of rectum cancer. Various strategies to minimize these complications have been developed in the last decade; one of the most promising is to use a rectal balloon to fixate the prostate gland during treatment or to inject biodegradable spacers between the prostate and rectum to reduce the rectal dose of radiation. Aim of our paper is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of spacers implantation.  Materials and methods:   From January 2021 to June 2022 all patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer with unfavorable/ intermediate risk - poor prognosis and programmed hypofractionated radiation therapy were enrolled. In all patients biodegradable balloons spacers were placed posteriorly to the prostate to increase the separation between prostate and rectum. The duration of the procedure, observation time, the appearance of early and late complications and their severity (according to Charlson comorbidity index) and tolerability of the device were recorded at the time of positioning and after 10 days.  Results:   25 patients were enrolled in our study. Two patients (8%) underwent acute urine retention resolved with catheterization and one patient (4%) developed a mild perineal hematoma that did not require any treatment. As regards late complications 1 patient (4%) developed hyperpyrexia (> 38°C) the day after the procedure requiring continuation of antibiotic regimen. At T1 visit we recorded no medium-high grade complications. As for the tolerability of the device, it was optimal with no perineal discomfort or alterations of bowel function.  Conclusions:   Biodegradable balloon spacers appears to be safe and well tolerated and its positioning does not present any technical difficulties or risks of major complications.""","""['Luca Topazio', 'Federico Narcisi', 'Fabio Tana', 'Cosimo Ciotta', 'Vincenzo Iossa', 'Pasquale Perna', 'Francesco Chiaramonti', 'Federico Romantini']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Arch Ital Urol Androl""","""['Application of an interstitial and biodegradable balloon system for prostate-rectum separation during prostate cancer radiotherapy: a prospective multi-center study.', 'Interstitial biodegradable balloon for reduced rectal dose during prostate radiotherapy: results of a virtual planning investigation based on the pre- and post-implant imaging data of an international multicenter study.', 'Is an Endorectal Balloon Beneficial for Rectal Sparing after Spacer Implantation in Prostate Cancer Patients Treated with Hypofractionated Intensity-Modulated Proton Beam Therapy?

In addition to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), new generation agents have provided survival advantages to patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC (mHSPC). In this analysis, we aimed to determine the most effective approach for treating and suppressing mHSPC using network meta-analysis (NMA).  Materials and methods:   A total of 10 trials investigating different treatment modalities were conducted using NMA. The analysis was performed for all mHSPC cases as well as for low- and high-volume and docetaxel-naive subgroups.  Results:   In combination with ADT, abiraterone acetate (AA) in the general-population and high-volume-disease subgroups, and enzalutamide in docetaxel-naive and low-volume-disease subgroups have the highest probability of being the best treatment modalities in terms of overall survival. In addition, in the low-volume and docetaxel-naive settings, enzalutamide was superior to ADT (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.429, 95% CrI: 0.258-0.714 and HR = 0.533, 95% CrI: 0.375-0.756, respectively). In addition, in the high-volume and general-population settings (all trials and cases), AA was superior to ADT (HR = 1.568, 95% CrI: 1.378-1.773 and HR = 1.164, 95%CrI: 1.348-1.924, respectively).  Conclusion:   The volume status based on the CHAARTED trial should be taken into account to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for mHSPC. AA plus prednisone in high-risk and high-volume-mHSPC patients and enzalutamide in low-volume-mHSPC patients could be favorable options in combination with ADT. Depending on the patient's tolerance, in high-volume mHSPC, docetaxel, or apalutamide in combination with ADT could be alternatives for AA, whereas in the low-volume mHSPC, local radiotherapy plus ADT or ADT alone could be utilized in place of enzalutamide.""","""['Hasan Mutlu', 'Hakan Bozcuk']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Cancer Res Ther""","""['Overall Survival After Systemic Treatment in High-volume Versus Low-volume Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer: Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.', 'Survival benefit, disease progression and quality-of-life outcomes of abiraterone acetate plus prednisone versus docetaxel in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: A network meta-analysis.', 'Triplet or Doublet Therapy in Metastatic Hormone-sensitive Prostate Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-analysis.', 'Systemic therapies for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer: network meta-analysis.', 'Hormone naïve metastatic prostate cancer: How to treat it?']"""

Previous studies have shown that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can reverse the tumorigenic phenotype of tumor cells. However, there are still challenges in using human ESCs (hESCs) directly in cancer treatment. To facilitate the practical application of hESCs, we established a co-culture system consisting of prostate cancer cell lines and hESCs and investigated the antitumor activity of the supernatant of the co-culture system (Co-Sp) in vitro and in vivo, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved. The Co-Sp decreased the viability of prostate cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner, significantly inhibited colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In addition, Co-Sp promoted apoptosis of prostate cancer cells and inhibited cell migration and invasion. In vivo studies also revealed that Co-Sp inhibited tumor growth in the xenograft model. Mechanistic studies showed that Co-Sp reduced the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4, CDK2, MMP-9, MMP-1, and Bcl-2, and increased the expression of p21, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, the Co-Sp decreased the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR in cells and tumor tissues. Taken together, our results indicated that the Co-Sp has potent antitumor activity and could directly inhibit tumor growth.

The aim of this study was to determine whether there are significant differences in staging criteria in patients who underwent prostatectomy compared to those who did not, and whether the number of affected and analyzed lymph nodes (LN) plays a prognostic role. In this retrospective study, a test cohort consisting of 404,210 newly diagnosed men with prostate cancer, between 2004 and 2010, was obtained from the 17 registries (Nov 2021 submission); a validation consisting of 147,719 newly diagnosed men with prostate cancer between 2004 and 2019 was obtained from the 8 registries (Nov 2021 submission). Prostate cancer-specific survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier curves, survival tables and Cox regression; overall survival was analyzed only to compare Harrell's C-index between different staging criteria. In initial analyses, it was observed that the prognostic value of lymph node metastasis changes according to the type of staging (clinical or pathological), which is linked to the surgical approach (prostatectomy). Compared with T4/N0/M0 patients, which are also classified as stage IVA, N1/M0 patients had a shorter [adjusted HR: 1.767 (1429-2184), p < 0.0005] and a longer [adjusted HR: 0.832 (0.740-0.935), p = 0.002] specific survival when submitted to prostatectomy or not, respectively. Analyzing separately the patients who were submitted to prostatectomy and those who were not, it was possible to obtain new LN metastasis classifications (N1: 1 + LN; N2: 2 + LNs; N3: > 2 + LNs). This new (pathological) classification of N allowed the reclassification of patients based on T and Gleason grade groups, mainly those with T3 and T4 disease. In the validation group, this new staging criterion was proven to be superior [specific survival C-index: 0.908 (0.906-0.911); overall survival C-index: 0.788 (0.786-0.791)] compared to that currently used by the AJCC [8th edition; specific survival C-index: 0.892 (0.889-0.895); overall survival C-index: 0.744 (0.741-0.747)]. In addition, an adequate number of dissected lymph nodes results in a 39% reduction in death risk [adjusted HR: 0.610 (0.498-0.747), p < 0.0005]. As main conclusion, the surgery has a major impact on prostate cancer staging, mainly modifying the effect of N on survival, and enabling the stratification of pathological N according to the number of affected LN. Such a factor, when considered as staging criteria, improves the prognosis classification.""","""['Felipe Andrés Cordero da Luz', 'Camila Piqui Nascimento', 'Eduarda da Costa Marinho', 'Pollyana Júnia Felicidade', 'Rafael Mathias Antonioli', 'Rogério Agenor de Araújo', 'Marcelo José Barbosa Silva']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""[]"""

Herein, we sought to further investigate the effects of these drugs association in some of their direct molecular targets (COX-2, VEGF and VEGFR-2) and in reactive stroma markers (TGF-β, αSMA, vimentin and pro-collagen 1) in the dorsolateral prostate, looking for lobe-specific responses. Male TRAMP mice were treated with celecoxib (10 mg/Kg, i.o.) and/or nintedanib (15 mg/Kg, i.o.) for 6 weeks and prostate was harvested for morphological and protein expression analyses. Results showed that combined therapy resulted in unique antitumor effects in dorsolateral prostate, especially due to the respective stromal or epithelial antiproliferative actions of these drugs, which altogether led to a complete inversion in high-grade (HGPIN) versus low-grade (LGPIN) premalignant lesion incidences in relation to controls. At the molecular level, this duality in drug action was paralleled by the differential down/upregulation of TGF-β signaling by celecoxib/nintedanib, thus leading to associated changes in stroma composition towards regression or quiescence, respectively. Additionally, combined therapy was able to promote decreased expression of inflammatory (COX-2) and angiogenesis (VEGF/VEGFR-2) mediators. Overall, celecoxib and nintedanib association provided enhanced antitumor effects in TRAMP dorsolateral as compared to former registers in ventral prostate, thus demonstrating lobe-specific responses of this combined chemoprevention approach.

However, no clinically established molecular biomarkers have been identified to predict the effectiveness of ADT before starting ADT. The tumor microenvironment of PCa contains fibroblasts that regulate PCa progression by producing multiple soluble factors. We have previously reported that AR-activating factor-secreted fibroblasts increase the responsiveness of androgen-sensitive, AR-dependent PCa cells to ADT. Thus, we hypothesized that fibroblast-derived soluble factors may affect cancer cell differentiation by regulating cancer-related gene expression in PCa cells and that the biochemical characteristics of fibroblasts may be used to predict the effectiveness of ADT. Here, we investigated the effects of normal fibroblasts (PrSC cells) and three PCa patient-derived fibroblast lines (pcPrF-M5, -M28, and -M31 cells) on the expression of cancer-related genes in androgen-sensitive, AR-dependent human PCa cells (LNCaP cells) and three sublines showing different androgen sensitivities and AR dependencies. The mRNA expression of the tumor suppressor gene NKX3-1 in LNCaP cells and E9 cells (which show low androgen sensitivity and AR dependency) was significantly increased by treatment with conditioned media from PrSC and pcPrF-M5 cells but not from pcPrF-M28 and pcPrF-M31 cells. Notably, no upregulation of NKX3-1 was observed in F10 cells (AR-V7-expressing, AR-independent cells with low androgen sensitivity) and AIDL cells (androgen-insensitive, AR-independent cells). Among 81 common fibroblast-derived exosomal microRNAs that showed 0.5-fold lower expression in pcPrF-M28 and pcPrF-M31 cells than in PrSC and pcPrF-M5 cells, miR-449c-3p and miR-3121-3p were found to target NKX3-1. In only LNCaP cells, the NKX3-1 mRNA expression was significantly increased by transfection of an miR-3121-3p mimic but not that of the miR-449c-3p mimic.

The purpose of this study was to highlight the profile of urological emergencies in two university hospitals in the city of Douala by assessing emergency management.  Methods:   we conducted a retrospective study of the urological emergencies in two reference hospitals in the city of Douala: the Laquintinie Hospital and the General Hospital. Files were collected over a period of 5 years (January 1st, 2016 to December 31st, 2020). All emergency consultations in the Emergency Unit as well as all clinical and therapeutic data from the on-call list during the study period were included. We excluded all emergencies (consultations during the study period) not recorded in the emergency registry.  Results:   we conducted a study of 364 patients with an average age of 43 ± 8.34 years; 92.58% (n=337) of patients were male. The most common urological emergencies included: urinary retention (45.05%, n=164), renal colic (15.33%, n=56) and haematuria (13.18%, n=48). The most common cause of urinary retention was prostate tumors, renal colic was mainly due to renal lithiasis (96.45%, n=159) and hematuria was due to tumor in 68.75% (n=33) of patients. Therapeutic management was based on urinary catheterization (39.01%, n=142), medical treatment was associated with monitoring (27.47%, n=100) and suprapubic cystostomy (10.71%, n=39).  Conclusion:   acute urinary retention due to prostate tumors is the most common urological emergency in the university hospitals in the city of Douala. Early and optimal management of prostate tumors is therefore essential.""","""['Frantz Guy Epoupa Ngalle', 'Landry Oriole Mbouche', 'Axel Stephane Nwaha Makon', 'Jean Cedrick Fouda', 'Junior Barthelemy Mekeme Mekeme', 'Armel Quentin Essomba', 'Jean-Jacques Nwatchap', 'Edouard Herve Moby Mpah']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Pan Afr Med J""","""[]"""

Macrophages are the most abundant immune cells in the prostate tumor microenvironment (TME) and are capable of killing tumor cells. To identify genes in the tumor cells that are critical for macrophage-mediated killing, we performed a genome-wide co-culture CRISPR screen and identified AR, PRKCD, and multiple components of the NF-κB pathway as hits, whose expression in the tumor cell are essential for being targeted and killed by macrophages. These data position AR signaling as an immunomodulator, and confirmed by androgen-deprivation experiments, that rendered hormone-deprived tumor cells resistant to macrophage-mediated killing. Proteomic analyses showed a downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation in the PRKCD- and IKBKG-KO cells compared to the control, suggesting impaired mitochondrial function, which was confirmed by electron microscopy analyses. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic analyses revealed that all hits impaired ferroptosis signaling, which was validated transcriptionally using samples from a neoadjuvant clinical trial with the AR-inhibitor enzalutamide. Collectively, our data demonstrate that AR functions together with the PRKCD and the NF-κB pathway to evade macrophage-mediated killing. As hormonal intervention represents the mainstay therapy for treatment of prostate cancer patients, our findings may have direct implications and provide a plausible explanation for the clinically observed persistence of tumor cells despite androgen deprivation therapy.""","""['Anniek Zaalberg', 'Emma Minnee', 'Isabel Mayayo-Peralta', 'Karianne Schuurman', 'Sebastian Gregoricchio', 'Thijs A van Schaik', 'Liesbeth Hoekman', 'Dapei Li', 'Eva Corey', 'Hans Janssen', 'Cor Lieftink', 'Stefan Prekovic', 'Maarten Altelaar', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Roderick L Beijersbergen', 'Wilbert Zwart', 'Andries Bergman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""bioRxiv""","""[]"""

Radiation therapy (RT) has been combined with ICI to potentially overcome this resistance and improve response rates but reported clinical trial results have thus far been disappointing. Novel approaches are required to overcome this resistance and reprogram the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and address this major unmet clinical need. Using diverse preclinical tumor models of prostate and bladder cancer, including an autochthonous prostate tumor (Pten-/-/trp53-/-) that respond poorly to radiation therapy (RT) and anti-PD-L1 combinations, the key drivers of this resistance within the TME were profiled and used to develop rationalized combination therapies that simultaneously enhance activation of anti-cancer T cell responses and reprogram the immunosuppressive TME. The addition of anti-CD40mAb to RT resulted in an increase in IFN-y signaling, activation of Th-1 pathways with an increased infiltration of CD8+ T-cells and regulatory T-cells with associated activation of the CTLA-4 signaling pathway in the TME. Anti-CTLA-4mAb in combination with RT further reprogrammed the immunosuppressive TME, resulting in durable, long-term tumor control.

Whether the activation process is affected by hydroxysteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 6 (HSD17B6) remains unknown.  Methods:   SREBP's transcriptional activities were analyzed using an SRE-luciferase (SRE-luc) reporter in 293T cells, Huh7 hepatoma cells, and primary human hepatocytes following a variety of conditions, including ectopic expression of HSD17B6, HSD17B6 mutants defective in its enzymatic activities, knockdown of HSD17B6, and cholesterol starvation. The interaction between HSD17B6 and SREBP/SCAP/INSIG complex was analyzed in 293T cells, Huh7 cells and mouse liver upon ectopic expression of HSD17B6 and its mutants; the interaction was also analyzed using endogenous proteins. The impacts of HSD17B6 on SREBP target expression, glucose tolerance, diet-induced obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) were examined using Huh7 cells in vitro, and with C57BL/6 and NONcNZO10/LtJ T2D mice in vivo.  Results:   HSD17B6 binds to the SREBP/SCAP/INSIG complex and inhibits SREBP signaling in cultured hepatocytes and mouse liver. Although HSD17B6 plays a role in maintaining the equilibrium of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the prostate, a mutant defective in androgen metabolism was as effective as HSD17B6 in inhibiting SREBP signaling. Hepatic expression of both HSD17B6 and the defective mutant improved glucose intolerance and reduced hepatic triglyceride content in diet-induced obese C57BL/6 mice, while hepatic knockdown of HSD17B6 exacerbated glucose intolerance. Consistent with these results, liver-specific expression of HSD17B6 in a polygenic NONcNZO10/LtJ T2D mice reduced T2D development.  Conclusions:   Our study unveils a novel role of HSD17B6 in inhibiting SREBP maturation via binding to the SREBP/SCAP/INSIG complex; this activity is independent of HSD17B6's sterol oxidase activity. Through this action, HSD17B6 improves glucose tolerance and attenuates the development of obesity-induced T2D.

More recently, cfDNA fragmentation patterns have emerged as a tool to infer epigenomic and transcriptomic information. However, most of these analyses used whole-genome sequencing, which is insufficient to identify FDA-approved biomarker indications in a cost-effective manner.  Patients and methods:   We used machine learning models of fragmentation patterns at the first coding exon in standard targeted cancer gene cfDNA sequencing panels to distinguish between cancer and non-cancer patients, as well as the specific tumor type and subtype. We assessed this approach in two independent cohorts: a published cohort from GRAIL (breast, lung, and prostate cancers, non-cancer, n = 198) and an institutional cohort from the University of Wisconsin (UW; breast, lung, prostate, bladder cancers, n = 320). Each cohort was split 70%/30% into training and validation sets.  Results:   In the UW cohort, training cross-validated accuracy was 82.1%, and accuracy in the independent validation cohort was 86.6% despite a median ctDNA fraction of only 0.06. In the GRAIL cohort, to assess how this approach performs in very low ctDNA fractions, training and independent validation were split based on ctDNA fraction. Training cross-validated accuracy was 80.6%, and accuracy in the independent validation cohort was 76.3%. In the validation cohort where the ctDNA fractions were all <0.05 and as low as 0.0003, the cancer versus non-cancer area under the curve was 0.99.

This study examines the organisation of treatment-related preferences expressed by patients and their partners during clinical consultations for people with localised prostate cancer. A conversation analysis of twenty-eight diagnosis and treatment consultations was conducted with data recorded from four clinical sites across England. When clinicians disaligned from expressions of preference such as directing talk away from expressions, or moving to redress perceived misunderstandings, it caused discordance in the unfolding interaction. This led to couples silencing themselves. Two deviant cases were identified that did not feature the misalignment found in all other collected cases. In these two cases, the interaction remained collaborative. These findings highlight the immediate consequences of expressions of preference being resisted, rejected, and dismissed in a context where clinicians are expected to explore expressed preferences in service of SDM. The deviant case analysis offers an alternative practice to the pattern observed across the collection, offering a comparison between misaligned sequences, and cases where social solidarity was maintained.

The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is highly conserved in mammals and plays an important role in carcinogenesis. YAP is one of major key effectors of the Hippo pathway. However, the mechanism supporting abnormal YAP expression in PC remains to be characterized.  Methods:   Western blot was used to measure the protein expression of ATXN3 and YAP, while the YAP target genes were measured by real-time PCR. CCK8 assay was used to detect cell viability; transwell invasion assay was used to measure the invasion ability of PC. The xeno-graft tumor model was used for in vivo study. Protein stability assay was used to detect YAP protein degradation. Immuno-precipitation assay was used to detect the interaction domain between YAP and ATXN3. The ubiquitin-based Immuno-precipitation assays were used to detect the specific ubiquitination manner happened on YAP.  Results:   In the present study, we identified ATXN3, a DUB enzyme in the ubiquitin-specific proteases family, as a bona fide deubiquitylase of YAP in PC. ATXN3 was shown to interact with, deubiquitylate, and stabilize YAP in a deubiquitylation activity-dependent manner. Depletion of ATXN3 decreased the YAP protein level and the expression of YAP/TEAD target genes in PC, including CTGF, ANKRD1 and CYR61. Further mechanistic study revealed that the Josephin domain of ATXN3 interacted with the WW domain of YAP. ATXN3 stabilized YAP protein via inhibiting K48-specific poly-ubiquitination process on YAP protein. In addition, ATXN3 depletion significantly decreased PC cell proliferation, invasion and stem-like properties. The effects induced by ATXN3 depletion could be rescued by further YAP overexpression.  Conclusions:   In general, our findings establish a previously undocumented catalytic role for ATXN3 as a deubiquitinating enzyme of YAP and provides a possible target for the therapy of PC.

The clinical manifestations and molecular characteristics of PCa are highly variable. Aggressive types require radical treatment, whereas indolent ones may be suitable for active surveillance or organ-preserving focal therapies. Patient stratification by clinical or pathological risk categories still lacks sufficient precision. Incorporating molecular biomarkers, such as transcriptome-wide expression signatures, improves patient stratification but so far excludes chromosomal rearrangements. In this study, we investigated gene fusions in PCa, characterized potential novel candidates, and explored their role as prognostic markers for PCa progression.  Methods:   We analyzed 630 patients in four cohorts with varying traits regarding sequencing protocols, sample conservation, and PCa risk group. The datasets included transcriptome-wide expression and matched clinical follow-up data to detect and characterize gene fusions in PCa. With the fusion calling software Arriba, we computationally predicted gene fusions. Following detection, we annotated the gene fusions using published databases for gene fusions in cancer. To relate the occurrence of gene fusions to Gleason Grading Groups and disease prognosis, we performed survival analyses using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, log-rank test, and Cox regression.  Results:   Our analyses identified two potential novel gene fusions, MBTTPS2,L0XNC01::SMS and AMACR::AMACR. These fusions were detected in all four studied cohorts, providing compelling evidence for the validity of these fusions and their relevance in PCa. We also found that the number of gene fusions detected in a patient sample was significantly associated with the time to biochemical recurrence in two of the four cohorts (log-rank test, p-value < 0.05 for both cohorts). This was also confirmed after adjusting the prognostic model for Gleason Grading Groups (Cox regression, p-values < 0.05).

Comorbidity, health literacy, late effects, and help-seeking behavior may affect healthcare use and may differ among socioeconomic groups. We examined healthcare use among cancer survivors, compared with cancer-free individuals, and investigated educational differences in healthcare use among cancer survivors.  Methods:   A Danish cohort of 127,472 breast, prostate, lung, and colon cancer survivors from the national cancer databases, and 637,258 age- and sex-matched cancer-free individuals was established. Date of entry was 12 months after diagnosis/index date (for cancer-free individuals). Follow-up ended at death, emigration, new primary cancer, December 31st, 2018, or up to 10 years. Information about education and healthcare use, defined as the number of consultations with general practitioner (GP), private practicing specialists (PPS), hospital, and acute healthcare contacts 1-9 years after diagnosis/index date, was extracted from national registers. We used Poisson regression models to compare healthcare use between cancer survivors and cancer-free individuals, and to investigate the association between education and healthcare use among cancer survivors.  Results:   Cancer survivors had more GP, hospital, and acute healthcare contacts than cancer-free individuals, while the use of PPS were alike. One-to-four-year survivors with short compared to long education had more GP consultations (breast, rate ratios (RR) = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.25-1.30; prostate, RR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.10-1.18; lung, RR = 1.18, 95% CI = 1.13-1.23; and colon cancer, RR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.13-1.22) and acute contacts (breast, RR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.26-1.45; prostate, RR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.15-1.38; lung, RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.16-1.33; and colon cancer, RR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.14-1.60), even after adjusting for comorbidity. One-to-four-year survivors with short compared to long education had less consultations with PPS, while no association was observed for hospital contacts.  Conclusion:   Cancer survivors used more healthcare than cancer-free individuals. Cancer survivors with short education had more GP and acute healthcare contacts than survivors with long education. To optimize healthcare use after cancer, we need to better understand survivors' healthcare-seeking behaviors and their specific needs, especially among survivors with short education.""","""['Anne Katrine Graudal Levinsen', 'Trille Kristina Kjaer', 'Thomas Maltesen', 'Erik Jakobsen', 'Ismail Gögenur', 'Michael Borre', 'Peer Christiansen', 'Robert Zachariae', 'Søren Laurberg', 'Peter Christensen', 'Niels Kroman', 'Signe Benzon Larsen', 'Thea Helene Degett', 'Lisbet Rosenkrantz Hölmich', 'Peter de Nully Brown', 'Christoffer Johansen', 'Susanne K Kjær', 'Lau Caspar Thygesen', 'Susanne Oksbjerg Dalton']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Health Serv Res""","""[]"""

However, all of these advances are limited due to the relatively large percentage of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and the limited strategies for follow up. This work proposes a methodology that uses discretization to predict prostate cancer BCR while optimizing the necessary variables. We used discretization of RNA-seq data to increase the prediction of biochemical recurrence and retrieve a subset of ten genes functionally known to be related to the tissue structure. Equal width and equal frequency data discretization methods were compared to isolate the contribution of the genes and their interval of action, simultaneously. Adding a robust clinical biomarker such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) improved the prediction of BCR. Discretization allowed classifying the cancer patients with an accuracy of 82% on testing datasets, and 75% on a validation dataset when a five-bin discretization by equal width was used. After data pre-processing, feature selection and classification, our predictions had a precision of 71% (testing dataset: MSKCC and GSE54460) and 69% (Validation dataset: GSE70769) should the patients present BCR up to 24 months after their final treatment. These results emphasize the use of equal width discretization as a pre-processing step to improve classification for a limited number of genes in the signature. Functionally, many of these genes have a direct or expected role in tissue structure and extracellular matrix organization. The processing steps presented in this study are also applicable to other cancer types to increase the speed and accuracy of the models in diverse datasets.""","""['Laura Marin', 'Fanny Casado']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Sci Rep""","""[]"""

In this study, we synthesized seven ODAP-Urea-Lys derivatives characterized with p-bromobenzyl group conjugated to lysine. The ligands showed medium-to-high potency, with Ki values ranging from 27.9 nM to 0.94 nM. The ligands could be efficiently radiolabeled with 68Ga, in high purity.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the risk factors is lacking. In this study, we aimed to identify groups at an increased risk of suicide among patients aged ≥75 years with a previous cancer diagnosis.  Material and methods:   All Polish individuals diagnosed with cancer at the age of ≥75 years between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2019 were included in this study. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.  Results:   A total of 410,440 patients (211,730 men and 198,710 women) were included in this study. SMR for both sexes was 1.64 (95 % CI 1.43-1.87). When analyzed by sex, a significantly higher risk was observed only in men (SMR 1.70, 95 % CI 1.47-1.95). Among them, the risk of suicide was observed after the diagnosis of lymphoma (2.83, 1.14-5.82), lung cancer (2.63, 1.70-3.89), kidney cancer (2.16, 1.03-3.96), colorectal cancer (1.96, 1.41-2.65), urinary tract cancer (1.86, 1.22-2.70), and prostate cancer (1.40, 1.07-1.82).

Here, we report that CXCR7 was elevated in the majority of prostate cancer (PCa) cases with neuroendocrine features (NEPC). CXCR7 markedly induced mitotic spindle and cell cycle gene expression. Mechanistically, we identified Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), a key regulator of mitosis, as a novel target that was bound and activated by the CXCR7-ARRB2 complex. CXCR7 interacted with proteins associated with microtubules and golgi, and, as such, the CXCR7-ARRB2-containing vesicles trafficked along the microtubules to the pericentrosomal golgi apparatus, where the complex interacted with AURKA. Accordingly, CXCR7 promoted PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth, which was mitigated by AURKA inhibition.

The aim of this study was to evaluate dosimetric differences between IMRT and IMPT when treating with whole pelvis radiation therapy (WPRT) postoperatively.  Materials and methods:   IMRT and IMPT plans were generated for 10 post-prostatectomy patients treated between July and August 2020. The prescription was 50 Gy radiobiologic equivalent (GyE) (proton radiobiological effective dose 1.1) to the pelvis and 70 GyE to the prostate bed in 2 GyE per fraction. Paired 2-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare clinical target volume (CTV) coverage and dose to organs at risk (OARs).  Results:   CTV coverage was met for all plans with 99% of CTVs receiving ≥99% of prescription doses. Dose to OARs was significantly higher with IMRT than IMPT for the following endpoints: bladder V5-V65; bowel V5-V45; sigmoid V5-V50; rectum V5-V70; femoral head V40 and maximum dose; bone V5-V65. Select endpoints with significant differences included bladder V30 (63.5 vs. 44.4%, p < .001), bowel V15 (949 vs. 191 cc, p = .001) and V30 (386 vs. 121 cc, p < .001), rectum V40 (81.8 vs. 32.1%, p < .001) and V50 (47.6 vs. 24.9%, p < .001), femoral head maximum doses (46.4-47.1 vs. 38.3-38.6GyE, p < .001), and bone V10 (93.3 vs. 85.4%, p < . 001). Mean doses for all OARs were significantly higher with IMRT, including bladder (41.9 vs. 29.7GyE, p < .001), bowel (21.2 vs. 5.5GyE, p < .001), and rectum (50.8 vs. 27.3GyE, p < .001).

Existing literature has shown that STEAP3 may perform an important role in the onset and progression of tumors. Nonetheless, a complete pan-cancer investigation of the prognostic significance and immune properties of STEAP3 is currently unavailable.  Aims:   As part of our investigation into the possible functions of STEAP3 in malignancies, we conducted a comprehensive analysis to examine the prognostic value and immune features of STEAP3 in human pan-cancer.  Methods and results:   R and Cytoscape programs were applied to analyze and visualize the data. The expression of STEAP3 in both cell lines and tissues was measured utilizing a variety of approaches. Using the shRNA knockdown technique, we tested the viability of the A498 and 786-O cell lines and validated their functions. Both CCK-8 and transwell assays were conducted to estimate cell proliferation and invasion. The expression of STEAP3 was substantially elevated and was shown to be linked to prognosis in the majority of malignancies, notably in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). In addition, the expression of STEAP3 was shown to have a strong correlation with immune infiltrates, which in turn triggered the recruitment and polarization of M2 macrophages in ccRCC. The protein STEAP3 shows promise as a predictor of responses to immune-checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Positive links between STEAP3 and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), the p53 pathway, and the immune-associated pathways were also found in the enrichment analysis. Our results illustrated that the STEAP3 expression level was substantially elevated in ccRCC tissues and suggested that it could stimulate EMT in ccRCC by downregulating CDH1.  Conclusion:   In a diverse range of cancers, STEAP3 might serve as a biomarker for determining the prognosis as well as a predictor of immunotherapy responsiveness. STEAP3 is a novel biological marker for determining prognosis, and it also performs a remarkable function in the promotion of tumor growth in ccRCC by enhancing invasion and EMT, as well as by triggering the recruitment and polarization of M2 macrophages.""","""['Haotian Wei', 'Zhaochen Li', 'Yang Zhao', 'Shimiao Zhu', 'Simeng Wen', 'Changyi Quan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Rep (Hoboken)""","""[]"""

Galeterone is weakly basic and exhibits low solubility in biorelevant media (i.e., ~ 2 µg/mL in fasted simulated intestinal fluid). It was formulated as a 50-50 (w/w) galeterone-hypromellose acetate succinate spray-dried dispersion to increase its bioavailability. Despite this increase, the bioavailability of this formulation may have been insufficient and contributed to its clinical failure. We hypothesized that reformulating galeterone as an amorphous solid dispersion by KinetiSol® compounding could increase its bioavailability. In this study, we examined the effects of composition and manufacturing technology (Kinetisol and spray drying) on the performance of galeterone amorphous solid dispersions. KinetiSol compounding was utilized to create galeterone amorphous solid dispersions containing the complexing agent hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin or hypromellose acetate succinate with lower drug loads that both achieved a ~ 6 × increase in dissolution performance versus the 50-50 spray-dried dispersion. When compared to a spray-dried dispersion with an equivalent drug load, the KinetiSol amorphous solid dispersions formulations exhibited ~ 2 × exposure in an in vivo rat study. Acid-base surface energy analysis showed that the equivalent composition of the KinetiSol amorphous solid dispersion formulation better protected the weakly basic galeterone from premature dissolution in acidic media and thereby reduced precipitation, inhibited recrystallization, and extended the extent of supersaturation during transit into neutral intestinal media.""","""['Stephen A Thompson', 'Urvi Gala', 'Daniel A Davis Jr', 'Sandra Kucera', 'Dave Miller', 'Robert O Williams rd']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""AAPS PharmSciTech""","""[]"""

However, most urological guidelines recommend PSA testing in men aged 55-69 through a shared decision-making process with the patient. The impact of prior cancer diagnosis on PSA testing is not well-known. To compare PSA testing in men aged 55-69 years with and without a history of cancer (excluding prostate cancer patients).  Materials and methods:   Utilizing the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a retrospective cross-sectional study during the year 2018 was carried out. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was implemented to demonstrate potential associations with PSA testing and assess the association of cancer history.  Results:   A total of 2,892 men aged 55-69 years from the NHIS survey who met the inclusion criteria were analyzed. A total of 308 (10.7%) men had a history of cancer (non-prostate).

Materials and methods:   Patients who received both EPI and PHI testing were identified from an institutional database of men referred to urology for an elevated total PSA. Cut points of EPI > 15.6 and PHI ≥ 36 were used to denote a positive test. Patients were placed into one of four groups determined by combination of EPI and PHI results. Demographic variables and biopsy recommendations were compared between groups. The concordance of test positivity between EPI and PHI was compared by Cohen's kappa. Demographic variables and secondary testing results were compared between patients' compliant and non-compliant with prostate biopsy recommendation. Biopsy pathology was compared between groups.  Results:   A total of 162 patients had both EPI and PHI testing. Median age was 65 years, with a median PSA of 6.64 ng/mL.

Postsurgical tissue microarray sections from the Canary Foundation (n = 1264) stained with anti-PTEN antibody were evaluated independently by pathologist conventional visual scoring (cPTEN) and an automated AI-based image analysis pipeline (AI-PTEN). The relationship of PTEN evaluation methods with cancer recurrence and metastasis was analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard and decision curve models.

We evaluated associations between low-income subsidy and treatment choice, treatment initiation, and overall survival in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.  Materials and methods:   We identified men aged 66 years and older diagnosed with stage IV prostate cancer between 2010 and 2017 included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked data set. Using linear probability models, we evaluated the impact of low-income subsidy on type of first supplementary treatment (oral vs IV) among patients who received nonandrogen deprivation therapy supplementary systemic therapy, and initiation of any nonandrogen deprivation therapy supplementary systemic therapy. Overall survival was estimated with Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   Of the 5,929 patients included, 1,766 (30%) had low-income subsidy. On multivariable analysis, those with low-income subsidy were more likely to receive oral as opposed to IV treatments compared to patients without low-income subsidy (probability difference: 17%, 95% CI 12, 22). However, patients with low-income subsidy were less likely to initiate any nonandrogen deprivation therapy supplementary systemic therapy (oral or IV) compared to those without low-income subsidy (probability difference: 7.9%, 95% CI 4.8-11). Additionally, patients with low-income subsidy experienced worse overall survival than those without low-income subsidy (P < .001).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of lesion apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in patients with prostate cancer undergoing MR-guided radiation therapy (MRgRT) on a 1.5T MR-Linac. The ADC values at a diagnostic 3T MRI scanner were used as the reference standard.  Patients and and methods:   In this prospective single-center study, patients with biopsy-confirmed prostate cancer who underwent both an MRI exam at a 3T scanner (MRI3T) and an exam at a 1.5T MR-Linac (MRL) at baseline and during radiotherapy were included. Lesion ADC values were measured by a radiologist and a radiation oncologist on the slice with the largest lesion. ADC values were compared before vs. during radiotherapy (during the second week) on both systems via paired t-tests. Furthermore, Pearson correlation coefficient and inter-reader agreement were computed.  Results:   A total of nine male patients aged 67 ± 6 years [range 60 - 67 years] were included. In seven patients, the cancerous lesion was in the peripheral zone, and in two patients the lesion was in the transition zone. Inter-reader reliability regarding lesion ADC measurement was excellent with an intraclass correlation coefficient of (ICC) > 0.90 both at baseline and during radiotherapy. Thus, the results of the first reader will be reported. In both systems, there was a statistically significant elevation of lesion ADC during radiotherapy (mean MRL-ADC at baseline was 0.97 ± 0.18 × 10-3 mm2/s vs. mean MRL-ADC during radiotherapy 1.38 ± 0.3 × 10-3 mm2/s, yielding a mean lesion ADC elevation of 0.41 ± 0.20 × 10-3 mm2/s, p < 0.001). Mean MRI3T-ADC at baseline was 0.78 ± 0.165 × 10-3 mm2/s vs. mean MRI3T-ADC during radiotherapy 0.99 ± 0.175 × 10-3 mm2/s, yielding a mean lesion ADC elevation of 0.21 ± 0.96 × 10-3 mm2/s p < 0.001). The absolute ADC values from MRL were consistently significantly higher than those from MRI3T at baseline and during radiotherapy (p < = 0.001). However, there was a strong positive correlation between MRL-ADC and MRI3T-ADC at baseline (r = 0.798, p = 0.01) and during radiotherapy (r = 0.863, p = 0.003).  Conclusions:   Lesion ADC as measured on MRL increased significantly during radiotherapy and ADC measurements of lesions on both systems showed similar dynamics. This indicates that lesion ADC as measured on the MRL may be used as a biomarker for evaluation of treatment response. In contrast, absolute ADC values as calculated by the algorithm of the manufacturer of the MRL showed systematic deviations from values obtained on a diagnostic 3T MRI system. These preliminary findings are promising but need large-scale validation. Once validated, lesion ADC on MRL might be used for real-time assessment of tumor response in patients with prostate cancer undergoing MR-guided radiation therapy.""","""['Haidara Almansour', 'Fritz Schick', 'Marcel Nachbar', 'Saif Afat', 'Victor Fritz', 'Daniela Thorwarth', 'Daniel Zips', 'Felix Bertram', 'Arndt-Christian Müller', 'Konstantin Nikolaou', 'Ahmed E Othman', 'Daniel Wegener']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiol Oncol""","""[]"""

Objectives:   The objectives of the study were to investigate the role of URGs in PRAD and their potential impact on patient prognosis.  Methods:   This study acquired data for more than 800 patients with PRAD from public databases. The unique ubiquitination-related patterns of PRAD were detected by unsupervised clustering approach. URGs relevant to the prognosis of patients with PRAD and a ubiquitination-related prognostic index (URPI) were identified and generated using the log-rank test, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, and bootstrap strategy.  Results:   Four ubiquitination-related subpopulations were then defined, and 39 ubiquitination-related differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer and paracancerous samples were screened, with LASSO analysis distinguishing six of them. The URPI was built and verified using the identified URGs that played critical roles in survival stratification. Several potential URPI-targeting drugs were also analyzed. Subsequently, the URPI was combined with clinical characteristics, which provided a more accurate estimate of PRAD survival and was a superior choice for PRAD prognostic forecasts.

The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) defined as the interval from the start of ARAT to death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the study period. The secondary endpoints were PSA decline, PSA nadir, and time to nadir (TTN) after ARATs. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were applied for depicting OS.

Results:   Among 202 patients, 164 patients were treated with first-line ARATs alone and 38 patients received second-line chemotherapy. The median OS was not reached in patients with first-line ARATs alone and was 38.8 months in those with subsequent chemotherapy after failure from ARATs. OS was not different between the use of abiraterone and enzalutamide, though enzalutamide showed a higher rate of PSA decline ≧ 90% (56% versus 40%, p = 0.021) and longer TTN (5.5 versus 4.7 months, p = 0.019).

Uncertainties in tissue and perfusion property values presently lead to quantitative inaccuracy of HTP, leading to sub-optimal treatment. Assessment of these uncertainties would allow for better judgement of the reliability of treatment plans and improve their value for treatment guidance. However, systematically investigating the impact of all uncertainties on treatment plans is a complex, high-dimensional problem and too computationally expensive for traditional Monte Carlo approaches. This study aims to systematically quantify the treatment-plan impact of tissue property uncertainties by investigating their individual contribution to, and combined impact on predicted temperature distributions.  Methods:   A novel Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE)-based HTP uncertainty quantification was developed and applied for locoregional hyperthermia of modelled tumours in the pancreatic head, prostate, rectum, and cervix. Patient models were based on the Duke and Ella digital human models. Using Plan2Heat, treatment plans were created to optimise tumour temperature (represented by T90) for treatment using the Alba4D system. For all 25-34 modelled tissues, the impact of tissue property uncertainties was analysed individually i.e., electrical and thermal conductivity, permittivity, density, specific heat capacity and perfusion. Next, combined analyses were performed on the top 30 uncertainties with the largest impact.  Results:   Uncertainties in thermal conductivity and heat capacity were found to have negligible impact on the predicted temperature ( < 1 × 10-10 °C), density and permittivity uncertainties had a small impact (< 0.3 °C). Uncertainties in electrical conductivity and perfusion can lead to large variations in predicted temperature. However, variations in muscle properties result in the largest impact at locations that could limit treatment quality, with a standard deviation up to almost 6 °C (pancreas) and 3.5 °C (prostate) for perfusion and electrical conductivity, respectively. The combined influence of all significant uncertainties leads to large variations with a standard deviation up to 9.0, 3.6, 3.7 and 4.1 °C for the pancreatic, prostate, rectal and cervical cases, respectively.  Conclusion:   Uncertainties in tissue and perfusion property values can have a large impact on predicted temperatures from hyperthermia treatment planning. PCE-based analysis helps to identify all major uncertainties, their impact and judge the reliability of treatment plans.""","""['Jort A Groen', 'Johannes Crezee', 'Hanneke W M van Laarhoven', 'Maarten F Bijlsma', 'H Petra Kok']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Comput Methods Programs Biomed""","""[]"""

Data from large randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing moderate hypofractionated (MHRT, 2.4-3.4 Gray/fraction (Gy/fx)) and ultra-hypofractionated (UHRT, >5 Gy/fx) with conventionally fractionated radiation therapy (CFRT, 1.8-2 Gy/fx) and the possible clinical implications have been reviewed.  Materials and method:   We searched PubMed, Cochrane and Scopus for RCT comparing MHRT/UHRT with CFRT treatment of locally and/or locally advanced (N0M0) PCa. We found six RCTs, which compared different radiation therapy regimes. Tumour control and acute and late toxicities are reported.  Results:   MHRT was non-inferior to CFRT for intermediate-risk PCa, non-inferior for low-risk PCa and not superior in terms of tumour control for high-risk PCa. Acute toxicity rates were increased compared to CFRT, especially an increase in acute gastrointestinal adverse effects was seen. Late toxicity related to MHRT seems to be comparable. UHRT was non-inferior in terms of tumour control in one RCT, with increased acute toxicity, but with comparable late toxicity. One trial, however, indicated increased late toxicity rates with UHRT.  Discussion and conclusion:   MHRT delivers similar therapeutic outcomes compared to CFRT in terms of tumour control and late toxicity for intermediate-risk PCa patients.

CisPt binding to proteins and enzymes may modulate its biochemical mechanism of action and is associated with cancer cell resistance to the drug. In this work, we investigate the interaction between cisplatin and angiogenin (Ang), a protein strongly expressed in many types of cancer and a potent angiogenic factor. The adduct formed upon reaction of CisPt with Ang (Ang@CisPt) was characterized by X-ray crystallography to evidence the exact platination site and by UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies to shed light on any possible change in the protein conformation. Furthermore, high-resolution electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was utilized to evaluate the Ang : CisPt stoichiometry of the Ang@CisPt adduct. The effect of the Ang@CisPt adduct on a prostate cancer cell line (PC-3) was tested by colorimetric assays in terms of cell viability, at both levels of nuclear and mitochondrial damage, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Cellular imaging by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM) was utilized to scrutinize the cytoskeleton actin reorganization and the lysosome and mitochondria organelle perturbation.

Methods:   The in situ PCa stem cells (PCSCs)-injected xenograft tumor models were established in BALB/c nude mice. Tumor volume and weight were respectively checked after baicalin (100 mg/kg) treatment. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the growth arrest and cell necrosis. mRNA expression levels of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), CD44, CD133 and Notch1 were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression levels of ALDH1, CD44, CD133, Notch1, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) P65 and NF-κB p-P65 were detected by Western blot. Expression and subcellular location of ALDH1, CD44, CD133, Notch1 and NF-κB p65 were detected by immunofluorescence analysis. In vitro, cell cycle distribution and cell apoptosis of PC3 PCSCs was assessed by flow cytometry after baicalin (125 µmol/L) treatment. The migration and invasion abilities of PCSCs were assessed using Transwell assays. Transmission electron microscopy scanning was utilized to observe the structure and autophagosome formation of baicalin-treated PCSCs. In addition, PCSCs were infected with lentiviruses expressing human Notch1.  Results:   Compared with the control group, the tumor volume and weight were notably reduced in mice treated with 100 mg/kg baicalin (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Histopathological analysis showed that baicalin treatment significantly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Furthermore, baicalin treatment reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of CD44, CD133, ALDH1, and Notch1 as well as the protein expression of NF-κB p-P65 in the xenograft tumor (P<0.01). In vitro, the cell proliferation of PCSCs was significantly attenuated after treatment with 125 µmol/L baicalin for 72 h (P<0.01). The cell migration and invasion rates were decreased following treatment with baicalin for 48 and 72 h (P<0.01). Baicalin notably induced cell apoptosis and seriously damaged the structure of PCSCs. The mRNA and protein expressions of CD133, CD44, ALDH1 and Notch1 in PCSCs were significantly downregulated following baicalin treatment (P<0.01). Importantly, the inhibitory effects of baicalin on PCa progression and stemness were reversed by Notch1 overexpression (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Materials and methods:   Men who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) for CaP in 2021 at our institution were identified. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of mpMRI in predicting pT2N0 organ confined disease , extracapsular extension , seminal vesicle invasion , lymph node involvement, and bladder neck invasion were evaluated.

Methods:   Two datasets, GSE28204 and GSE134051 (including human PCa and BPH), were downloaded from the GEO database. The batch effect was removed for merging, and then differential gene expression analysis was conducted to identify BPH and PCa cases. The diagnostic biomarkers of BPH and PCa were further screened using machine learning and bioinformatics. ROC curves were drawn to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the selected biomarkers. An online website and qPCR were used to preliminarily explore the expression levels of PCa biomarkers. The correlations between the expression of biomarkers and the tumor microenvironment, tumor mutation load and immunotherapy drugs were evaluated.  Results:   We identified fifteen genes (CHRDL1, DES, FLNC, GSTP1, MYL9, TGFB3, NEFH, TAGLN, SPARCL1, SYNM, TRPM8, HPN, PLA2G7, ENTPD5 and GPR160) as critical diagnostic biomarkers. After reviewing the literature on all selected biomarkers, we found few studies on the four genes CHRDL1, NEFH, TAGLN and SYNM in BPH or PCa. We defined these four genes as new potential diagnostic biomarkers (NPDBs) of BPH and PCa. All NPDBs were downregulated in PCa patients and PCa cell lines and upregulated in BPH patients and cell lines. When the immune landscape and mutation frequencies were analyzed, the results showed that the tumor microenvironment (TME), immune landscape, tumor mutation burden, and drug response were significantly correlated with NPDB expressions.

We noted dramatically higher basal and inducible levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in enzalutamide-resistant PCa and castration-resistant PCa (CRPC), in comparison to enzalutamide-sensitive PCa cells or primary therapy-naive tumors respectively. Unbiased metabolomic evaluation identified that glutamine metabolism was consistently upregulated in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells and CRPC tumors. Stable isotope tracing studies suggest that this enhanced glutamine metabolism drives an antioxidant program that allows these cells to tolerate higher basal levels of ROS. Inhibition of glutamine metabolism with either a small-molecule glutaminase inhibitor or genetic knockout of glutaminase enhanced ROS levels, and blocked the growth of enzalutamide-resistant PCa. The critical role of compensatory antioxidant pathways in maintaining enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells was validated by targeting another antioxidant program driver, ferredoxin 1.

Several species of Hedychium have remained under-explored with respect to their chemical composition and biological activities.  Aim of the study:   The current research aimed to explore the chemical composition and evaluate the antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities of rhizome essential oil from four Hedychium species (H. coccineum, H. gardnerianum, H. greenii and H. griffithianum).  Materials and methods:   Compound identification was accomplished using a Clarus 580 gas chromatography system in conjunction with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The multivariate data statistics using chemometrics (PCA, PLS-DA, sPLS-DA) and cluster analysis (Dendrogram, Heat maps, K-means) were used to compare the similarity and relationship among Hedychium metabolomes. MTT assay was employed to visualize the antiproliferative property against MCF7, HepG2 and PC3 cancerous cell lines. The toxicity of essential oils was determined using 3T3-L1 non-tumorigenic/normal cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells were used to investigate the anti-inflammatory properties of Hedychium essential oils by measuring the production of nitric oxide (NO) using the Griess reagent method. Furthermore, the levels of prostaglandin (PGE2) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β) was assessed using the ELISA technique.  Results:   In total, 82 compounds were identified in four targeted species of Hedychium from which 1,8-cineole (52.71%), β-pinene (32.83%), α-pinene (19.62%), humulene epoxide II (19.86%) and humulene epoxide I (19.10%) were the major constituents. Monoterpenes (8.5-59.9%) and sesquiterpenes (2.87-54.11%) were the two class of compounds, found as the most prevalent in the extracted essential oils. The multivariate analysis classified the four Hedychium species into three different clusters. Hedychium essential oils exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against MCF7, HepG2 and PC3 cancer cell lines with IC50 values less than 150 μg/mL where H. gardnerianum exhibited the highest selective cytotoxicity against human breast and prostate adenocarcinoma cells with an IC50 value of 44.04 ± 1.07 μg/mL and 56.11 ± 1.44 μg/mL, respectively. The essential oils on normal (3T3-L1) cells displayed no toxicity with higher IC50 values thereby concluding as safe to use for normal human health without causing any side effects. Besides, the essential oils at 100 μg/mL concentration revealed remarkable anti-inflammatory activity in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages by inhibiting the production of inflammatory mediators, with H. greenii exhibiting the maximum anti-inflammation response by significantly suppressing the levels of NO (84%), PGE2 (87%), TNF-α (94.3%), IL-6 (95%) and IL-1β (85%) as compared to LPS treated group.

NEPC is usually associated with tumor aggression, hormone therapy resistance, and poor clinical outcome.

Achaete-scute complex-like 1 (ASCL1) plays a role in neuronal commitment and differentiation and olfactory and autonomic neuron generation. This study revealed that ASCL1 was regulated by the SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2) and highly expressed in NEPC cells, which was closely related to poor prognosis. Moreover, ASCL1 overexpression significantly enhanced CRPC progression to NEPC by resisting ferroptosis. Mechanically, ferroptosis resistance was mediated by CAMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) phosphorylation, promoted by substantially upregulated ASCL1 in NEPC cells. In addition, upregulated SOX2 induced PCa cell differentiation into neuroendocrine tumors by mediating their lineage changes.

Nevertheless, a substantial amount of new data is now available to provide a logical explanation regarding the possible link between 1) the occurrence of single or multiple acquired/somatic mutations and 2) the generation and progression of skin cancer, as well as 3) the potential association of the above two facts with the availability of nitrosamines in drugs for hypertension, diabetes, gastritis, acne, tuberculosis, various other antibiotics, etc. The nitrosogenesis of skin cancer is slowly but surely being established as a significant concept that could not be ignored for longer periods of time. It should only be analysed in detail with a view to future prevention for the benefit of public health. The nitrosogenesis of skin cancer is slowly but surely being established as a significant concept that cannot be ignored for longer periods of time. It should only be analysed in detail with a view to future prevention for the benefit of public health. Although this information has been known for decades (but in relation to the development of other cancers), there is still no comparative analysis of the mutations that occur after ingestion of a particular mutagen, also known as nitrosamine. This analysis could to some extent highlight/support or reject to some extent the thesis of the role of nitrosamines and genetic instability leading to the subsequent generation of a malignant cell clone. The notion of skin cancer nitrosogenesis should become a priority concept very soon, but it should also become an evidential memory, a byword, and an equivalent of the ignorance with which modern civilization has treated its own health for decades within the processes of globalization. It is these processes that include nitrosamines as a major component of the ""medicinal and nutritional menu"" of patients. It remains unclear at present why regulatory authorities are making endless attempts to legalise the availability of a number of mutagens/human carcinogens in the most commonly distributed medicines worldwide. And to persuade ""others"" that there is no risk from their permanent, controlled and long-term intake. The newly introduced regulatory norms in practice concern the potential/permissive availability of nitrosamines in a serious number of drugs: drugs with radically different mechanisms of action such as: ranitidine, metformin, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, thiazide diuretics, sartans, rifampicin, but also probably a number of others. However, the occurrence of identical, similar patterns of cancers (skin cancers) following their administration (after ingestion of different classes of drugs) makes the ubiquitous permissive availability of nitrosamines (in each class of these drugs) the most potent and most likely pathogenetic inducer of cancer. These comparative patterns of skin tumor occurrence should have even stronger evidentiary value than even so-called prospective follow-ups. Nitrosamines are and remain one of the best studied mutagens/carcinogens that can alter/modify the human genome. A fact underlined repeatedly over the years (also based on in vivo data, repeatedly ignored) and a fact that, according to the literature, concerns mainly tire industry workers (British rubber workers). It is in this category of patients and after exposure to high doses of nitrosamines (potential inhalation intake) that high mortality has been found in bladder, lung, stomach, oesophageal cancer, multiple myeloma, leukaemia, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and liver cancer. Similar international observations (in vivo/Sweden) concerning intensive human exposure (Swedish rubber workers) to high doses of nitrosamines in a working atmosphere (inhalation type of carcinogen uptake) emphasize the resulting direct subsequent risk of other alarming symptoms such as: nasal bleeds, eye and throat symptoms, hoarseness, cough, nausea, headache, and altered levels of eosinophils and total immunoglobulin G (IgG), compared with unexposed patients. The neglect of these important observations over the years has led to the ubiquitous and currently difficult to counteract and unpunished prevalence of nitrosamines in even the most commonly distributed drugs worldwide (except in the food industry). It is precisely because of this fact that it should come as no surprise to anyone that there is new evidence of an avalanche in the number of new cancers after ingestion of potentially nitrosamine-contaminated preparations. Skin cancer could be seen in the near future precisely as a model of a side reaction after application or long-term contact with mutagens called nitrosamines. Based on the above, and wishing to add to the worldwide data on the heterogeneous cancers that occur after contact with nitrosamines, we draw the attention of the scientific community to the risk of developing keratinocytic cancer after ingestion of nitrosamine-contaminated drugs: sartans and thiazide diuretics. We believe that the role of the generic substance in these drugs could also contribute to some extent to the progression of an already present tumour branch, but this influence is rather minor and without significant clinical relevance. We present a patient who had been taking 2 sartans (valsartan/ olmesartan) over the years as monotherapy and in combination with hydrochlorothiazide, who developed over time and within this intake two forms of keratinocytic cancer: verrucous carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma. The focus of discussion concerns a newly introduced medical concept: nitrosogenesis of skin cancer. The detailed study of nitrosogenesis should be a major, primary task for regulators, researchers, clinicians, and pharmaceutical companies.""","""['G Tchernev', 'S Kordeva']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Georgian Med News""","""[]"""

Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) status is a promising tool in this regard. The Parsortix® CTC isolation system employs an epitope-independent approach based on cell size and deformability to increase the capture rate of CTCs. Here, we present a protocol for prospective evaluation of this method to predict post radical prostatectomy (RP) PCa cancer recurrence.  Methods:   We plan to recruit 294 patients diagnosed with unfavourable intermediate, to high and very high-risk localised PCa. Exclusion criteria include synchronous cancer diagnosis or prior PCa treatment, including hormone therapy. RP is performed according to the standard of care. Two blood samples (20 ml) are collected before and again 3-months after RP. The clinical team are blinded to CTC results and the laboratory researchers are blinded to clinical information. Treatment failure is defined as a PSA ≥ 0.2 mg/ml, start of salvage treatment or imaging-proven metastatic lesions. The CTC analysis entails enumeration and RNA analysis of gene expression in captured CTCs. The primary outcome is the accuracy of CTC status to predict post-RP treatment failure at 4.5 years. Observed sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values will be reported. Specificity will be presented over time.  Discussion:   CTC status may reflect the true potential for PCa metastasis and may predict clinical outcomes better than the current PCa progression risk grading systems. Therefore establishing a robust biomarker for predicting treatment failure in localized high-risk PCa would significantly enhance guidance in treatment decision-making, optimizing cure rates while minimizing unnecessary harm from overtreatment.

The C-C-A haplotype, whereby the first C is located at rs2294008 of PSCA and is a low risk allele for gastric cancer, has become a target of positive selection in Asia. Conversely, the C-A-G haplotype carrying the same C allele has become a selection target mainly in Africa. However, Asian and African share both haplotypes, consistent with the haplotype divergence time (170 kya) prior to the out-of-Africa dispersal. The frequency of C-C-A/C-A-G is 0.344/0.278 in Asia and 0.209/0.416 in Africa. Two-dimensional site frequency spectrum analysis revealed that the extent of intra-allelic variability of the target haplotype is extremely small in each local population, suggesting that C-C-A or C-A-G is under ongoing hard sweeps in local populations. From the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of selected haplotypes, the onset times of positive selection were recent (3-55 kya), concurrently with population subdivision from a common ancestor. Additionally, estimated selection coefficients from ABC analysis were up to ~3%, similar to those at other loci under recent positive selection. Phylogeny of local populations and TMRCA of selected haplotypes revealed that spatial and temporal switching of positive selection targets is a unique and novel feature of ongoing selection at PSCA.

Our results reveal that SPP1+ myCAFs arise from the inflammatory CAFs in hormone-sensitive PCa; therefore, they represent two functional states of an otherwise ontogenically identical cell type. Antiandrogen treatment unleashes TGF-β signaling, resulting in SOX4-SWI/SNF-dependent CAF phenotype switching. SPP1+ myCAFs in turn render PCa refractory to ADT via an SPP1-ERK paracrine mechanism. Importantly, these sub-myCAFs are associated with inferior therapeutic outcomes, providing the rationale for inhibiting polarization or paracrine mechanisms to circumvent castration resistance.

Thus, the objective of this study was to explore the optimal temporal resolution and measurement length for DCE-MRI to differentiate cancerous from normal prostate tissue of the peripheral zone of the prostate by non-parametric MRI analysis and to compare with a quantitative MRI analysis. Predictors of interest were onset time, relative signal intensity (RSI), wash-in slope, peak enhancement, wash-out and wash-out slope determined from non-parametric characterisation of DCE-MRI intensity-time profiles.

When comparing prostate cancer tissue with normal prostate tissue, median RSI was 422% vs 330%, and wash-in slope 0.870 vs 0.539. The peak enhancement of 67 vs 42 was higher with prostate cancer tissue, while wash-out (-30% vs -23%) and wash-out slope (-0.037 vs -0.029) were lower, and the onset time (32 seconds) was comparable. The optimal C-statistics was 0.743 for temporal resolution of 8.0 seconds and measurement length of 2.5 minutes compared with 0.656 derived from a quantitative MRI analysis.

Methods:   Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with LTL were identified from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) involving 472,174 individuals. Summary-level data of PCa-related GWAS were extracted from four cohorts comprising 456,717 individuals. An inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) algorithm was used for MR. Sensitivity analyses were performed with MR-Egger regression, IVW regression, leave-one-out test, and MR-Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier analyses. A meta-analysis was also performed to compute the average genetically determined effect of LTL on PCa.  Results:   A long LTL was associated with an increased risk of PCa in all cohorts, with odds ratios of 1.368 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.247 to 1.500, P = 2.84×10-11), 1.503 (95% CI: 1.243 to 1.816, P = 2.57×10-5), 1.722 (95% CI: 1.427 to 2.077, P = 1.48×10-8), and 1.358 (95% CI: 1.242 to 1.484, P = 1.73×10-11) in the IVW analysis. Sensitivity analyses showed that the genetically determined effect of LTL on PCa was stable and reliable. The meta-analysis showed that the genetically determined per 1-standard deviation rise in LTL correlated significantly with an average 40.6% increase in the PCa risk, with an average odds ratio of 1.406 (95% CI: 1.327 to 1.489, P < 0.001).

High-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) is used mainly for high-risk, localized, and locally advanced cases. However, few studies exist on the efficacy of HDR-BT and external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for metastatic prostate cancer.  Patients and methods:   We conducted a retrospective analysis of 39 patients diagnosed with regional lymph node metastasis and/or a limited number of metastases who underwent HDR-BT and EBRT with long-term androgen deprivation therapy. We utilized Cox's proportional hazards models to identify predictors of oncological outcomes. Treatment outcomes, including biochemical recurrence-free survival (BCRFS), clinical progression-free survival (CPFS), and castration-resistant prostate cancer-free survival (CRPCFS), were compared according to the clinical stage.  Results:   The median follow-up duration was 49 months (range=23-136 months). The 5-year BCRFS, CPFS, CRPCFS, and cancer-specific survival rates were 62.2%, 67.2%, 83.2%, and 93.4%, respectively. Based on Kaplan-Meier analysis, N1M0 and N0-1M1b showed favorable outcomes compared with N1M1a. Multivariate analysis revealed that N1M1a prostate cancer was an independent risk factor for poor BCRFS, CPFS, and CRPCFS.  Conclusion:   HDR-BT and EBRT with androgen deprivation therapy is a feasible approach for patients with newly diagnosed regional and low-metastatic-burden prostate cancer.

In advanced stage, this pathology is a lethal disease and is the fifth cause of cancer death in men worldwide. The diagnosis of PCa is performed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detection combined with direct rectal examination (DRE). However, high PSA levels can be detected in non-malignant conditions leading to overtreatment of non-oncological patients. Moreover, PSA levels are not associated with disease progression; therefore, the research of novel biomarkers could improve diagnosis and prognosis of this tumor. In this regard, genetic polymorphisms may affect PCa outcome as well as to be associated with cancer familiarity. In fact, germline variations detected in different genes including BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and HOXB13 seem to be associated with PCa susceptibility and progression.  Materials and methods:   Somatic and germline polymorphisms were detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) in 48 PCa subjects and paired controls. Gene variants were matched with patient outcome and cancer familiarity to identify mutations linked to prognosis and tumor predisposition.  Results:   NGS sequencing has allowed to identify different genetic polymorphisms that could be linked to cancer outcome and predisposition. In particular, somatic and germline mutations found in ATM, FOXA1 and SPOP genes correlate with poor prognosis and/or high Gleason score. Moreover, germline variants lying mainly in ATM, but also in ZFHX3, SPOP, CHD1, CDK12 and APC seem to be associated with hereditary-predisposing cancer syndrome.

Their location, physiological functions, and metabolism are closely related, making the occurrence and outcome of these tumors highly similar. Cuproptosis is a new type of cell death that is different from apoptosis and plays an essential role in tumors.

Method:   In our study, we identified 35 co-expression cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLs) from the urinary pan-cancer system. 28 CRLs were identified as prognostic-related CRLs by univariate Cox regression analysis. Then 12 CRLs were obtained using lasso regression and multivariate cox analysis to construct a prognostic model. We divided patients into high- and low-risk groups based on the median risk scores. Next, Kaplan-Meier analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), functional rich annotations, and nomogram were used to compare the differences between the high- and low-risk groups. Finally, the prediction of tumor immune dysfunction and rejection, gene mutation, and drug sensitivity were discussed.  Conclusion:   Finally, the candidate molecules of the urinary system pan-cancer were identified. This CRLs risk model may be promising for clinical prediction of prognosis and immunotherapy response in urinary system pan-cancer patients.""","""['Zhihui Ma', 'Haining Liang', 'Rongjun Cui', 'Jinli Ji', 'Hongfeng Liu', 'Xiaoxue Liu', 'Ping Shen', 'Huan Wang', 'Xingyun Wang', 'Zheyao Song', 'Ying Jiang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur J Med Res""","""[]"""

The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) publishes ""Deaths: leading causes"" annually. The ranking list used by the NCHS and statistical offices in several countries includes broad categories such as cancer, heart disease, and accidents. However, the list used by the World Health Organization (WHO) subdivides broad categories (17 for cancer, 8 for heart disease, and 6 for accidents) and classifies Alzheimer disease and related dementias and hypertensive diseases more comprehensively compared to the NCHS list. Regarding the data visualization of the rankings of leading CODs, the bar chart is the most commonly used graph; nevertheless, bar charts may not effectively reveal the changes in the rankings over time.  Objective:   The aim of this study is to use a dashboard with bump charts to visualize the changes in the rankings of the leading CODs in the United States by sex and age from 1999 to 2021, according to 2 lists (NCHS vs WHO).  Methods:   Data on the number of deaths in each category from each list for each year were obtained from the Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research system, maintained by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Rankings were based on the absolute number of deaths. The dashboard enables users to filter by list (NCHS or WHO) and demographic characteristics (sex and age) and highlight a particular COD.  Results:   Several CODs that were only on the WHO list, including brain, breast, colon, hematopoietic, lung, pancreas, prostate, and uterus cancer (all classified as cancer on the NCHS list); unintentional transport injury; poisoning; drowning; and falls (all classified as accidents on the NCHS list), were among the 10 leading CODs in several sex and age subgroups. In contrast, several CODs that appeared among the 10 leading CODs according to the NCHS list, such as pneumonia, kidney disease, cirrhosis, and sepsis, were excluded from the 10 leading CODs if the WHO list was used. The rank of Alzheimer disease and related dementias and hypertensive diseases according to the WHO list was higher than their ranks according to the NCHS list. A marked increase in the ranking of unintentional poisoning among men aged 45-64 years was noted from 2008 to 2021.  Conclusions:   A dashboard with bump charts can be used to improve the visualization of the changes in the rankings of leading CODs according to the WHO and NCHS lists as well as demographic characteristics; the visualization can help users make informed decisions regarding the most appropriate ranking list for their needs.""","""['Shu-Yu Tai', 'Ying-Chen Chi', 'Yu-Wen Chien', 'Ichiro Kawachi', 'Tsung-Hsueh Lu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JMIR Public Health Surveill""","""[]"""

Holothurin A (HA), a triterpenoid saponin isolated from Holothuria scabra, has now been characterized for its diverse biological activities. However, the mechanisms of HA in EMT-driven metastasis of human PCa cell lines has not yet been investigated. Moreover, runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) acts as an oncogene in prostate cancer, but little is known about its role in the EMT. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine how RUNX1 influences EMT-mediated metastasis, as well as the potential effect of HA on EMT-mediated metastasis in endogenous and exogenous RUNX1 expressions of PCa cell lines. The results demonstrated that RUNX1 overexpression could promote the EMT phenotype with increased EMT markers, consequently driving metastatic migration and invasion in PC3 cell line through the activation of Akt/MAPK signaling pathways. Intriguingly, HA treatment could antagonize the EMT program in endogenous and exogenous RUNX1-expressing PCa cell lines. A decreasing metastasis of both HA-treated cell lines was evidenced through a downregulation of MMP2 and MMP9 via the Akt/P38/JNK-MAPK signaling pathway. Overall, our approach first demonstrated that RUNX1 enhanced EMT-driven prostate cancer metastasis and that HA was capable of inhibiting the EMT and metastatic processes and should probably be considered as a candidate for metastasis PCa treatment.""","""['Sirorat Janta', 'Kanta Pranweerapaiboon', 'Pornpun Vivithanaporn', 'Anuchit Plubrukarn', 'Arthit Chairoungdua', 'Prachayaporn Prasertsuksri', 'Somjai Apisawetakan', 'Kulathida Chaithirayanon']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mar Drugs""","""[]"""

Severe and moderate lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were defined as IPSS ≥ 20 and ≥ 8, respectively; OAB was defined as a nocturnal frequency of ≥ 2 and a total OABSS of ≥ 3. In total, 203 patients (median age: 66 years) were included, with a mean follow-up of 8.4 years after treatment. The IPSS and OABSS worsened after 3 months of treatment; these scores improved to pretreatment levels after 18-36 months in most patients. Patients with a higher baseline IPSS and OABSS had a higher frequency of moderate and severe LUTS and OAB at 24 and 60 months, respectively. LUTS and OAB at 24 and 60 months were not correlated with the dosimetric factors of LDR-BT.

The aim of this study was to assess a population-based sample of metastatic prostate cancer patients receiving palliative radiation therapy to bone metastases and contemporary palliative systemic therapy and identify factors that impact long-term survival.  Materials/methods:   This retrospective, population-based, cohort study assessed all prostate cancer patients receiving palliative RT for bone metastases at a Canadian provincial Cancer program during a contemporary time period. Baseline patient, disease, and treatment characteristics were extracted from the provincial medical physics databases and the electronic medical record. Post-RT Survival intervals were defined as the time interval from the first fraction of palliative RT to death from any cause or date of the last known follow-up. The median survival of the cohort was used to dichotomize the cohort into short- and long-term survivors following RT. Univariable and multivariable hazard regression analyses were performed to identify variables associated with post-RT survival.  Results:   From 1 January 2018 until 31 December 2019, 545 palliative RT courses for bone metastases were delivered to n = 274 metastatic prostate cancer patients with a median age of 76 yrs (Interquartile range (IQR) 39-83) and a median follow-up of 10.6 months (range 0.2 to 47.9).

After inclusion and exclusion criteria, we compared APC and analyzed cancer-specific mortality (CSM) and overall mortality (OM) in CCPC patients and prognostic risk factors using a propensity score matching (PSM) study and multivariate Cox regression. We included 408,004 cases of APC as a control group and 130 cases of CCPC as a case group. Compared with APC patients, the incidence of CCPC was extremely low, and the median age of diagnosis was older (72.00 years vs. 69.00 years, p < 0.01). In addition, more rates were diagnosed at an earlier stage (1975-1998, 93.1% vs. 50.2%, p < 0.001), more unstaged or unknown stage ratios (87.7% vs. 42.7%, p < 0.001), and more surgical treatments (66.2% vs. 47.6%, p < 0.001), but the prognosis of CCPC patients was worse. After PSM, the median survival time of CCPC patients was shorter (57.50 month vs. 88.00 month, p < 0.01), the rate of CSM was higher (41.5% vs. 27.7%, p < 0.05), and the rate of OM was higher (99.2% vs. 90.8%, p < 0.01). In the adjusted model 2 after PSM, the CSM risk of CCPC patients reached HR 1.76 (95%CI 1.13-2.72), which was 76% higher than that of APC patients (p < 0.05). It was further found that surgical treatment might benefit CSM in CCPC patients (HR 0.39, 95%CI 0.18-0.82, p < 0.05) in Univariate analysis, but it was insignificant in further multivariate analysis. This is the first large-scale case-control report on the survival risk and prognostic factors of CCPC patients. We found that the prognosis of CCPC patients was significantly worse than that of APC.

Our results demonstrated that Pollonein-LAAO, a new L-amino acid oxidase obtained from Bothrops moojeni venom, was cytotoxic to PC-3 cells in two-dimensional and in tumor spheroid assays. Pollonein-LAAO was able to increase the intracellular ROS generation that culminates in cell death from apoptosis by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways due to the up-regulation of TP53, BAX, BAD, TNFRSF10B and CASP8. Additionally, Pollonein-LAAO reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and caused G0/G1 phase to delay, due to the up-regulation of CDKN1A and the down-regulation of the expression of CDK2 and E2F. Interestingly, Pollonein-LAAO inhibited critical steps of the cellular invasion process (migration, invasion and adhesion), due to the down-regulation of SNAI1, VIM, MMP2, ITGA2, ITGAV and ITGB3.

Adherence to both the supervised exercise classes and home exercise programme was high (78% and 94% respectively). No adverse events were recorded during the intervention or assessments. Qualitative feedback from stakeholders highlighted the acceptability of the programme as well as many perceived benefits of the exercise programme. Improvements in three quality of life sub-scales (physical function, role function and emotional function), physical activity levels and aerobic fitness levels were found post-intervention.

It appears to regulate a switch to an androgen-independent form of cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which frequently still requires androgen receptor (AR) signalling. We have previously shown that upon mating, binucleate secondary cells (SCs) of the Drosophila melanogaster male accessory gland (AG), which share some similarities with prostate epithelial cells, switch their growth regulation from a steroid-dependent to a steroid-independent form of Ecdysone Receptor (EcR) control. This physiological change induces genome endoreplication and allows SCs to rapidly replenish their secretory compartments, even when ecdysone levels are low because the male has not previously been exposed to females. Here, we test whether the Drosophila Rb homologue, Rbf, and E2F1 regulate this switch. Surprisingly, we find that excess Rbf activity reversibly suppresses binucleation in adult SCs. We also demonstrate that Rbf, E2F1 and the cell cycle regulators, Cyclin D (CycD) and Cyclin E (CycE), are key regulators of mating-dependent SC endoreplication, as well as SC growth in both virgin and mated males. Importantly, we show that the CycD/Rbf/E2F1 axis requires the EcR, but not ecdysone, to trigger CycE-dependent endoreplication and endoreplication-associated growth in SCs, mirroring changes seen in CRPC. Furthermore, Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signalling, mediated by the BMP ligand Decapentaplegic (Dpp), intersects with CycD/Rbf/E2F1 signalling to drive endoreplication in these fly cells. Overall, our work reveals a signalling switch, which permits rapid growth of SCs and increased secretion after mating, independently of previous exposure to females. The changes observed share mechanistic parallels with the pathological switch to hormone-independent AR signalling seen in CRPC, suggesting that the latter may reflect the dysregulation of a currently unidentified physiological process.""","""['Aashika Sekar', 'Aaron Leiblich', 'S Mark Wainwright', 'Cláudia C Mendes', 'Dhruv Sarma', 'Josephine E E U Hellberg', 'Carina Gandy', 'Deborah C I Goberdhan', 'Freddie C Hamdy', 'Clive Wilson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS Genet""","""[]"""

Methods:   835 publications were sourced from the Web of Science database (WOS) from 2003 to 2022. Citespace, VOSviewer, and Bibliometrix were used for the bibliometric analysis.  Results:   The number of published publications increased in early years, but declined in the last 5 years. The United States was the leading country in citations, publications, and top institutions. Prostate and Karolinska Institutet were the most publications of journal and institution, respectively. Jan-Ake Gustafsson was the most influential author based on the number of citations/publications. The most cited paper was ""Estrogen receptors and human disease"" by Deroo BJ, published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation. The most frequently used keywords were PCa (n = 499), gene-expression (n = 291), androgen receptor (AR) (n = 263), and ER (n = 341), while ERb (n = 219) and ERa (n = 215) further emphasized the importance of ER.  Conclusions:   This study provides useful guidance that ERa antagonists, ERb agonists, and the combination of estrogen with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) will potentially serve as a new treatment strategy for PCa. Another interesting topic is relationships between PCa and the function and mechanism of action of PRs subtypes. The outcome will assist scholars in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the current status and trends in the field, and provide inspiration for future research.""","""['Wenqiang Liao', 'Xuxia Sui', 'Gaoming Hou', 'Mei Yang', 'Yuxue Lin', 'Junjie Lu', 'Qingtao Yang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Oncol""","""[]"""

We aimed to assess the associations of (1) MVPA level at 12-month follow-up and (2) long-term MVPA patterns (from immediately post-intervention to 12-month follow-up) with different cancer-related health outcomes.  Methods:   In the Physical training and Cancer (Phys-Can) RCT, 577 participants diagnosed with breast (78%), prostate (19%), or colorectal (3%) cancer were randomized to 6 months of exercise during curative cancer treatment. Accelerometer-assessed physical activity and outcome data (ie, cancer-related fatigue, health-related quality of life [HRQoL], anxiety and depression, functioning in daily life, cardiorespiratory fitness, sedentary time and sleep) were collected immediately post-intervention and at 12-month follow-up. Based on the sample's median of MVPA immediately post-intervention (65 minutes/day) and the changes between the 2 measurement points, 4 categories with different long-term MVPA patterns were created: High & Increasing, High & Decreasing, Low & Increasing, and Low & Decreasing. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed for the analyses.  Results:   A total of 353 participants were included in the analyses. At 12-month follow-up, a higher MVPA level was significantly associated with lower fatigue in 3 domains (general fatigue [β = -.33], physical fatigue [β = -.53] and reduced activity [β = -.37]), higher cardiorespiratory fitness (β = .34) and less sedentary time (β = -.35). For long-term MVPA patterns, compared to the participants in the ""Low & Decreasing"" category, those in the ""High & Increasing"" category reported significantly lower fatigue in 3 domains (general fatigue [β = -1.77], physical fatigue [β = -3.36] and reduced activity [β = -1.58]), higher HRQoL (β = 6.84) and had less sedentary time (β = -1.23).  Conclusion:   Our results suggest that long-term physical activity is essential for improving health outcomes post-intervention in cancer survivors. Cancer survivors, including those who reach recommended MVPA levels, should be encouraged to maintain or increase MVPA post-intervention for additional health benefits.

Aim:   To analyze temporal trends in prostate cancer mortality in Chile.  Material and methods:   Mortality rates in Chile for the period between 1955 and 2019 were calculated. The number of deaths was obtained from the national demographic yearbooks and the Ministery of Health mortality registries. Population estimates from the demographic center of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean of the United Nations were used. Chilean census population of 2017 was used as reference to calculate adjusted rates. Trends were analyzed using a join point regression.  Results:   Crude mortality rates of prostatic cancer increased between 1995 and 2012 in three different phases, namely between 1955 and 1989 with a 2.7% annual increase, between 1989 and 1996 at a 6.8% annual rate, and between 1996 to 2012 with a 2.8% annual increase. From 2012 the rate remained stable. Adjusted mortality rates increased slowly at a 1.7% rate from 1955 to 1993, accelerating between 1993 and 1996, when they increased 12.1% per year. From 1996 onwards there was a significant decrease in mortality at a 1.2% annual rate. This decrease was significant and observed within all age groups but more importantly at older ages.

The aim of our study was to determine the optimal prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD) threshold and predictive factors of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in patients with a PI-RADS 3 lesion on MRI.  Patients and methods:   Using our prospectively maintained database, we conducted a monocentric retrospective study, including all patients with a clinical suspicious of prostate cancer (PCa), all of them had a PI-RADS 3 lesion on the mpMRI prior to PBx. Patients under active surveillance or displaying suspicious digital rectal examination were excluded. Clinically significant (csPCa) was defined as PCa with any ISUP grade group ≥ 2 (Gleason ≥ 3 + 4).  Results:   We included 158 patients. The detection rate of csPCa was 22.2%. In case of PSAD ≤ 0.15 ng/ml/cm3, PBx would be omitted in 71.5% (113/158) of men at the cost of missing 15.0% (17/113) of csPCa. With a threshold of 0.15 ng/ml/cm3, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.51 and 0.78 respectively. The positive predictive value was 0.40 and the negative predictive value was 0.85. According to multivariate analysis, age (OR = 1.10, CI95% 1.03-1.19, P = 0.007), and PSAD ≥ 0.15 ng/ml/cm3 (OR = 3.59, CI95% 1.41-9.47, P = 0.008) were independent predictive factors of csPCa. Previous negative PBx was negatively associated with csPCa (OR = 0.24, CI 95% 0.07-0.66, P = 0.01).  Conclusion:   Our result suggests that the optimal PSAD threshold was 0.15 ng/ml/cm3. However, in this case omitting PBx in 71.5% of cases would be at the cost of missing 15.0% of csPCa. PSAD should not be used alone, other predictive factors as age and PBx history should also be considered in the discussion with the patient, to avoid PBx while missing few csPCa.""","""['Truong-An Nguyen', 'Alexandre Fourcade', 'Audrey Zambon', 'Kevin Saout', 'Charles Deruelle', 'Vincent Joulin', 'Valentin Tissot', 'Laurent Doucet', 'François Rozet', 'Georges Fournier', 'Antoine Valeri']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urol Oncol""","""[]"""

For that reason, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation treatment and develop a comprehensive treatment strategy earlier than that in the general stroke population. We investigated the relationship between physical function and its outcome 1 month after the start of intensive rehabilitation treatment in patients with Trousseau syndrome, to obtain insights for determining the indications for intensive rehabilitation in these patients.  Patient concerns:   The development of Trousseau syndrome may worsen the performance status (PS), often necessitating a reevaluation of the indications for treatment of the primary cancer. Furthermore, the primary cancer may progress during rehabilitation therapy.  Diagnoses:   These patients were diagnosed with Trousseau syndrome.  Interventions:   All patients underwent training under the supervision of a therapist for 2 to 3 hours per day, 7 days per week, with a focus on exercise therapy. The functional independence measure (FIM) 1 month after admission to the convalescent rehabilitation ward, modified Rankin scale (mRS) score on admission and on the date of last assessment, and its outcome was examined.  Outcomes:   The time from stroke onset to admission to rehabilitation ranged from 22 to 60 days. Primary cancers were lung, bladder, prostate, ovarian, uterine, and unknown primary. Four patients had advanced cancer with distant metastasis. Two patients were discharged to home with independent activities of daily living (ADL) status. Two patients were transferred to palliative care, and 3 patients died. The 2 patients with independent ADL status had a mean motor score of 90 and a mean cognitive score of 30 on FIM, while the other 5 patients had a mean motor score of 29 and a mean cognitive score of 21 at 1 month of admission. Patients with mRS > 3 on admission did not have independent ADL status at 1 month.

Unfortunately, radiotherapeutic efficacy is often diminished when patients develop more aggressive or metastatic phenotypes. Recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles participate in cancer therapeutic resistance by delivering small bioactive molecules, such as small non-coding RNAs. Here, we show that stromal cell-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) facilitate the radioresistance of PCa cells by transporting interleukin-8 (IL-8). Indeed, prostatic stromal cells secrete more IL-8 than AR-positive PCa cells, which can be accumulated in sEVs. Intriguingly, the uptake of stromal cells-derived sEVs by radiosensitive PCa cells enhanced their radioresistance, which could be attenuated by silencing CXCL8 in stromal cells or inhibiting its receptor CXCR2 in PCa cells. sEV-mediated radioresistance has been validated in zebrafish and mouse xenograft tumours. Mechanistically, the uptake of stromal sEVs triggers the AMPK-activated autophagy pathway in PCa cells under the irradiation condition. Consequently, inactivating AMPK efficiently resensitized radiotherapy either by utilizing an AMPK inhibitor or silencing AMPKα in PCa cells. Furthermore, chloroquine (CQ), a lysosomal inhibitor, sufficiently resensitized radiotherapy via blockade of autophagolysosome fusion, leading to autophagosome accumulation in PC cells. Collectively, these results suggest that stromal cells enhance the radioresistance of PCa cells mainly through sEVs that deliver IL-8.""","""['Xiumei Wang', 'Fan Xu', 'Hengyuan Kou', 'Yawen Zheng', 'Jing Yang', 'Zhi Xu', 'Yao Fang', 'Wenbo Sun', 'Shuyi Zhu', 'Qin Jiang', 'Xiaowei Wei', 'Yong Xu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Extracell Vesicles""","""[]"""

A nomogram was used to predict the survival possibility of patients. Additionally, TIME, tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion (TIDE), stemness indexes, somatic mutations, and drug sensitivity were evaluated in different risk groups with OC. STEAP3 protein expression was detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC).  Results:   STEAP3 displayed marked overexpression in OC. STEAP3 is an independent risk factor for OC. Based on the mRNA levels of STEAP3-related genes (SRGs), two distinct clusters were identified. Patients in the cluster 2 (C2) subgroup had a considerably worse prognosis, higher immune cell infiltration, and lower stemness scores. Pathways involved in tumorigenesis and immunity were highly enriched in the C2 subgroup. A prognostic model based on 13 SRGs was further developed. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the overall survival (OS) of high-risk patients was poor. The risk score was significantly associated with TIME, TIDE, stemness indexes, tumor mutation burden (TMB), immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. Finally, IHC revealed that STEAP3 protein expression was noticeably elevated in OC, and overexpression of STEAP3 predicted poor OS and relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients.  Conclusion:   In summary, this study revealed that STEAP3 reliably predicts patient prognosis and provides novel ideas for OC immunotherapy.""","""['Zouyu Zhao', 'Chongfeng Sun', 'Jishuai Hou', 'Panpan Yu', 'Yan Wei', 'Rui Bai', 'Ping Yang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Ovarian Res""","""[]"""

The transcription factor Pou2f3 is a master regulator of the tuft cell lineage. We show that tuft cells are upregulated early during prostate cancer development, and their numbers increase with progression. Cancer-associated tuft cells in the mouse prostate express DCLK1, COX1, COX2, while human tuft cells express COX1. Mouse and human tuft cells exhibit strong activation of signaling pathways including EGFR and SRC-family kinases. While DCLK1 is a mouse tuft cell marker, it is not present in human prostate tuft cells. Tuft cells that appear in mouse models of prostate cancer display genotype-specific tuft cell gene expression signatures. Using bioinformatic analysis tools and publicly available datasets, we characterized prostate tuft cells in aggressive disease and highlighted differences between tuft cell populations.

NK1R expression increased in prostate cancer patients, particularly higher in metastatic prostate cancer and treatment-related NEPC, implying a relation with the progression from primary luminal adenocarcinoma toward NEPC. High NK1R level was clinically correlated with accelerated tumor recurrence and poor survival. Mechanical studies identified a regulatory element in the NK1R gene transcription ending region that was recognized by AR. AR inhibition enhanced the expression of NK1R, which mediated the PKCα-AURKA/N-Myc pathway in prostate cancer cells. Functional assays demonstrated that activation of NK1R promoted the NE transdifferentiation, cell proliferation, invasion, and enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer cells.

Results: In total, 396 men with newly diagnosed unfavorable intermediate-risk PCa were studied. Metastatic disease was observed in 37 (9.3%) men, of whom 29 (7.3%) had molecular imaging locoregional lymph node metastases (miN1) and 16 (4.0%) had distant metastases (miM1).

The whole-body PSMA total tumor volume (PSMA-TV) was measured for each patient. Other factors such as prostate-specific antigen, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, and alkaline phosphatase were recorded. A log-rank cutoff finder was used to define the PSMA-TV optimal cutoff.

Intracellular RNLS is a FAD-dependent oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.3.5), while extracellular RNLS lacks its N-terminal peptide, FAD cofactor, and exhibits various protective effects in a non-catalytic manner. Certain evidence exists, that plasma/serum RNLS is not an intact protein secreted into the extracellular space, and exogenous recombinant RNLS is effectively degraded during short-term incubation with human plasma samples. Some synthetic analogues of the RNLS sequence (e.g. the Desir's peptide RP-220, a 20-mer peptide corresponding to the RNLS sequence 220-239) have effects on cell survival. This suggests that RNLS-derived peptides, formed during proteolytic processing, may have own biological activity. Based on results of a recent bioinformatics analysis of potential cleavage sites of RNLS (Fedchenko et al., Medical Hypotheses, 2022) we have investigated the effect of four RNLS-derived peptides as well as RP-220 and its fragment (RP-224) on the viability of two cancer cell lines: HepG₂ (human hepatoma) and PC3 (prostate cancer). Two RNLS-derived peptides (RP-207 and RP-220) decreased the viability of HepG₂ cells in a concentration dependent manner. The most pronounced and statistically significant effect (30-40% inhibition of cell growth) was observed at 50 μM concentration of each peptide. In the experiments with PC3 cells five of six RNLS-derived peptides had a significant impact on the cell viability. RP-220 and RP-224 decreased cell viability; however, no concentration dependence of this effect was observed in the range of concentrations studied (1-50 μM). Three other RNLS-derived peptides (RP-207, RP-233, and RP-265) increased viability of PC3 cells by 20-30%, but no concentration-dependence of this effect was found. Data obtained suggest that some RNLS-derived peptides may influence the viability of various cells and manifestation and direction of the effect (increase of decrease of the cell viability) is cell-type-specific.""","""['V I Fedchenko', 'G E Morozevich', 'A E Medvedev']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Khim""","""[]"""

Objectives:   To examine CRF and prostate, colon, and lung cancer incidence and mortality in Swedish men, and to assess whether age moderated any associations between CRF and cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A prospective cohort study was conducted in a population of men who completed an occupational health profile assessment between October 1982 and December 2019 in Sweden. Data analysis was performed from June 22, 2022, to May 11, 2023.  Exposure:   Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed as maximal oxygen consumption, estimated using a submaximal cycle ergometer test.  Main outcomes and measures:   Data on prostate, colon, and lung cancer incidence and mortality were derived from national registers. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Data on 177 709 men (age range, 18-75 years; mean [SD] age, 42 [11] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 26 [3.8]) were analyzed. During a mean (SD) follow-up time of 9.6 (5.5) years, a total of 499 incident cases of colon, 283 of lung, and 1918 of prostate cancer occurred, as well as 152 deaths due to colon cancer, 207 due to lung cancer, and 141 deaths due to prostate cancer. Higher levels of CRF (maximal oxygen consumption as milliliters per minute per kilogram) were associated with a significantly lower risk of colon (HR, 0.98, 95% CI, 0.96-0.98) and lung cancer (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99) incidence, and a higher risk of prostate cancer incidence (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01). Higher CRF was associated with a lower risk of death due to colon (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-1.00), lung (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99), and prostate (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.93-0.97) cancer. After stratification into 4 groups and in fully adjusted models, the associations remained for moderate (>35-45 mL/min/kg), 0.72 (0.53-0.96) and high (>45 mL/min/kg), 0.63 (0.41-0.98) levels of CRF, compared with very low (<25 mL/min/kg) CRF for colon cancer incidence. For prostate cancer mortality, associations remained for low (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-1.00), moderate (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.97), and high (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.10-0.86) CRF. For lung cancer mortality, only high CRF (HR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.99) was significant. Age modified the associations for lung (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-0.99) and prostate (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.00; P < .001) cancer incidence, and for death due to lung cancer (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.99-0.99; P = .04).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this cohort of Swedish men, moderate and high CRF were associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. Low, moderate, and high CRF were associated with lower risk of death due to prostate cancer, while only high CRF was associated with lower risk of death due to lung cancer. If evidence for causality is established, interventions to improve CRF in individuals with low CRF should be prioritized.""","""['Elin Ekblom-Bak', 'Emil Bojsen-Møller', 'Peter Wallin', 'Sofia Paulsson', 'Magnus Lindwall', 'Helene Rundqvist', 'Kate A Bolam']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JAMA Netw Open""","""[]"""

Methods:   We examined associations between BMI and prostate cancer screening outcomes, incidence, and mortality in men randomized to the intervention arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial (n = 36,756) between 1993-2001. Participants received annual screening with the prostate specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal exam (DRE). Associations between baseline BMI and screening outcomes were assessed via multinomial logistic regression, and associations with prostate cancer incidence and mortality were assessed via Cox proportional hazards regression.  Results:   Individuals with higher BMI were less likely to screen positive via the PSA test and/or DRE and more likely to have an inadequate screen (all p-trend < 0.01). Higher BMI was inversely associated with prostate cancer incidence (hazard ratio [95% confidence interval] per 5 kg/m2 BMI increase: 0.94[0.91-0.97]), including incidence of early-stage (0.94[0.90-0.97]) and advanced-stage (0.91[0.82-1.02]) disease, but positively associated with prostate cancer mortality (1.21[1.06-1.37]). The association with mortality was not modified by screening outcome (p-interaction = 0.13).  Conclusions:   Within this screened population, individuals with higher BMI had lower risk of prostate cancer diagnosis but higher risk of prostate cancer mortality. As higher BMI was not positively associated with advanced-stage prostate cancer risk, the increased mortality is unlikely to be due to delayed prostate cancer detection.""","""['Lauren M Hurwitz', 'Nadine Dogbe', 'Kathryn Hughes Barry', 'Stella Koutros', 'Sonja I Berndt']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Natl Cancer Inst""","""[]"""

Treatment of cancer is mainly based on surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and their combination, while gene therapy has been emerged as a new kind of therapy for cancer. Post-transcriptional regulation of genes has been of interest in recent years and among various types of epigenetic factors that can modulate gene expression, short non-coding RNAs known as microRNAs (miRNAs) have obtained much attention. The stability of mRNA decreases by miRNAs to repress gene expression. miRNAs can regulate tumor malignancy and biological behavior of cancer cells and understanding their function in tumorigenesis can pave the way towards developing new therapeutics in future. One of the new emerging miRNAs in cancer therapy is miR-218 that increasing evidence highlights its anti-cancer activity, while a few studies demonstrate its oncogenic function. The miR-218 transfection is promising in reducing progression of tumor cells. miR-218 shows interactions with molecular mechanisms including apoptosis, autophagy, glycolysis and EMT, and the interaction is different. miR-218 induces apoptosis, while it suppresses glycolysis, cytoprotective autophagy and EMT. Low expression of miR-218 can result in development of chemoresistance and radio-resistance in tumor cells and direct targeting of miR-218 as a key player is promising in cancer therapy.

Cancer stem cells are a subset of cells that control metastasis and cell proliferation. In this study, we focus on the roles of miR-10b, miR-21 and correlate with cancer stem cells through the apoptotic pathway in different stages of prostate cancer (PCa).  Methods:   In total, 45 patients, each group with Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), localised PCa, and metastatic PCa, were recruited. MicroRNA and gene expression were estimated through quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Flow cytometry was used to characterise prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs), estimate reactive oxygen species (ROS), apoptosis and chemiluminescent immunoassay was used to estimate interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-α), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and testosterone.  Results:   The fold change mean expressions of miR-21, miR-10b, Cytochrome C, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) were significantly upregulated in localised and metastatic PCa compared with BPH. In contrast, the mean fold change expressions of Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX), Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) were lower in localised and metastatic PCa compared to BPH. The levels of IL-6, TNF-α, ROS, PSA and testosterone also showed a significant increase while apoptosis was decreased in both localized PCa and metastatic PCa as compared with BPH. In bioinformatics analyses, we found a similar pattern of miRNAs and gene expression in PCa databases. Our study also found a high expression of CD44+/CD24- and CD44+/CD133+ in localised and metastatic PCa compared with BPH.  Conclusion:   Our findings suggest miR-10b and miR-21 promote PCSCs and may target apoptotic genes involved in PCa pathogenesis; these miRNAs could be used as diagnosis biomarkers of PCa. In PCa pathogenesis and PCSCs regulation, the interaction between these two players is crucial and will help develop new PCa therapeutic targets.""","""['Kamla Kant Shukla', 'Gautam Ram Choudhary', 'Shrimanjunath Sankanagoudar', 'Sanjeev Misra', 'Jeewan Ram Vishnoi', 'Puneet Pareek', 'Kiran Kumar Pilla', 'Sachchida N Pandey', 'Praveen Sharma']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""[]"""

This method in addition to having a lower cost has high sensitivity and specificity.  Methods:   Anti- PSCA antibodies were purified and conjugated to super magnetic oxide nanoparticles (SPION). Then, iron staining on prostate adenocarcinoma tissues was performed. At the same time, immunohistochemically staining was performed on similar tissues to compare the results. In addition, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) samples were used as a control sample.  Results:   In adenocarcinoma tissues with iron staining, many blue spots are seen compared to benign tissues, and the number of these spots increases with increasing tumor grade.

Methods:   The study was designed as multicenter and retroprospective. The sample comprised 553 subjects with a CLL diagnosis. Data collection commenced in August 2016, and completed at May 2021.  Results:   Fifty one of 553 patients followed for CLL, had a history of SPC. SPC development rate was 9.2%. Epithelial tumors were mostly observed.

The 13q deletion was the most common genetic abnormality in those who developed SPC, and the frequency of 13q deletion was found to be increased statistically significant in those with malignancy, compared to those who did not.  Conclusion:   In CLL patients with SPC, the age of diagnosis, 13q and CD38 positivity, and treatment rates with fludarabine and monoclonal antibodies were found to be higher. Also, we determined that SPC frequency increased independently from hemogram values (except hemoglobin values), ß2 microglobulin level on admission, number of treatment lines, and genetic mutations other than 13q, in CLL patients.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), including carbamazepine (CBZ) and valproic acid (VPA), have been proven strong inhibitors against cancer cell growth. This study investigated the effect of Graviola fruit extract (GFE) on CBZ in healthy rat plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In addition, the effect of GFE in combination with CBZ and VPA on two human cancer cell lines (PC3 and MCF-7) was explored.  Methods:   The CBZ levels were analyzed using a simple validated HPLC method. The linearity was achieved at a 0.9998 coefficient of determination over a range of 75-5000 ng/mL CBZ. The MTT assay was used to quantify the percentage of viable cells.  Result:   The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) for CBZ alone were 4,631 ng/mL and 49,225 ng. h/mL, respectively. However, in the presence of GFE, the values reduced significantly to 2,994 ng/mL and 26,587 ng. h/mL, while the p-value was <0.05. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay results for VPA showed a weak cytotoxicity activity on PC3 and MCF-7 cell lines.  Conclusion:   A simple and validated HPLC method was used to determine CBZ levels in rats' plasma. The plasma CBZ levels (Cmax) were significantly reduced in the presence of GFE, indicating the importance of drug-herb interactions. For in vitro studies, two human cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (breast cancer cells) and PC3 (prostate cancer cells), were used to screen the cytotoxicity activity of GFE, CBZ, and VPA. We observed an antagonism effect for GFE and CBZ combination in both cell lines with FIC values > 4.

Despite the importance of correct intake of these drugs, adherence in patients with mCRPC is still poorly investigated and managed with measures not specific to this population. A self-report questionnaire was developed and validated with women with breast cancer treated with oral HT (A-BET). Therefore, this study aims to test the psychometric properties of this instrument on patients with mCRPC treated with AA or ENZ. A prospective observational validation study. The questionnaire was completed by all participants and again after 7/10 days by a randomized subsample to assess stability.

Pathway analysis, gene clustering, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis were employed to find characteristics associated with metastasis. Chr19 had the most mutation density and 1p36 had the highest mutation frequency across the genome. These mutations occurred in 1630 genes, including the most frequently mutated genes TTN and PLEC, and dozens of metastasis-related genes, such as FOXA1, NCOA1, CD34, and BRCA2.

Existing studies often lack information about clinical risk factors, are limited by their retrospective design or only use a single detection method for HPV.  Material and methods:   A total of 140 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) for PCa at the Department of Urology, Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, Germany, were prospectively enrolled. Knowledge of HPV and sociodemographic parameters were assessed with questionnaires. The following methods were used for HPV detection: RP specimens were tested for HPV DNA by PCR. If HPV DNA was detected, an LCD-Array hybridization technique was used for HPV subtyping, and immunohistochemical staining for p16 was performed as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Serological titers of HPV-16 L1 antibodies were measured using an HPV-16-specific immunoassay.  Results:   HPV DNA was detected in 9.3% (13/140) of RP specimens, with HPV-16 being the most predominantly detected subtype (5/13 = 39%). HPV-16 L1 antibody levels were below the limit of detection in 98% of patients (137/140). We found no significant difference between HPV PCR-positive (HPV+) and -negative (HPV-) patients in terms of HPV-16 antibody levels, history of HPV-associated diseases, level of education or marital status. Seventy-five percent of all PCa patients had never heard of HPV before. An acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate was the most frequently detected histologic type in both HPV+ (100%) and HPV- (98%) patients (p = 0.86). HPV+ patients had fewer positive biopsy cores (3.5 vs. 5.8; p = 0.01) and a lower maximal tumor infiltration rate per core (37% vs. 57%; p = 0.03) compared to HPV- patients. However, when analyzing the whole prostate and the lymph nodes after RP, there were no significant differences in TNM stage, Gleason score or tumor volume between both groups. In a subgroup analysis of all high-risk HPV patients (n = 6), we found no significant differences in sociodemographic, clinical or histopathological parameters compared to HPV- or low-risk HPV+ patients.  Conclusion:   In our prospective study, we were not able to prove a clinically significant impact of HPV status on tumor characteristics in RP specimens.

The optimal derivative possesses greater potency (IC50 = 0.27 µM) and selectivity than QW07 towards AR-positive 22Rv1 cells.""","""['Inderpal Sekhon', 'Guanglin Chen', 'Keyara Piri', 'Seiji Shinkawa', 'Dennis Ashong', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Guangdi Wang', 'Qiao-Hong Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Molecules""","""[]"""

Methods and Materials: We relied on an institutional tertiary-care database to identify the patients who underwent robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy between January 2014 and January 2021. Patients were divided into three age groups: age group one (≤60 years), age group two (61-69 years) and age group three (≥70 years). Multivariable logistic regression models tested the differences between the age groups in the analyses addressing long-term urinary continence after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Results: Of the 201 prostate cancer patients treated with robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy, 49 (24%) were assigned to age group one (≤60 years), 93 (46%) to age group two (61-69 years) and 59 (29%) to age group three (≥70 years). The three age groups differed according to long-term urinary continence: 90% vs. 84% vs. 69% for, respectively, age group one vs. two vs. three (p = 0.018). In the multivariable logistic regression, age group one (Odds Ratio (OR) 4.73, 95% CI 1.44-18.65, p = 0.015) and 2 (OR 2.94; 95% CI 1.23-7.29; p = 0.017) were independent predictors for urinary continence, compared to age group three. Conclusion: Younger age, especially ≤60 years, was associated with better urinary continence after robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. This observation is important at the point of patient education and should be discussed in informed consent.""","""['Cristina Cano Garcia', 'Mike Wenzel', 'Clara Humke', 'Clarissa Wittler', 'Julius Dislich', 'Reha-Baris Incesu', 'Jens Köllermann', 'Thomas Steuber', 'Markus Graefen', 'Derya Tilki', 'Pierre I Karakiewicz', 'Luis A Kluth', 'Felix Preisser', 'Felix K H Chun', 'Philipp Mandel', 'Benedikt Hoeh']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Medicina (Kaunas)""","""[]"""

This study aimed to investigate the oncogenic role of DNER and the mechanisms behind its oncogenic role in gastric cancer. Analysis of the RNASeq data of gastric cancer tissues obtained from the TCGA database revealed that the expression of DNER was associated with the pathology of advanced gastric cancer and the prognosis of patients. DNER expression was increased upon stem cell-enriching cancer spheroid culture. Knockdown of DNER expression inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, induced apoptosis, enhanced chemosensitivity, and decreased spheroid formation of SNU-638 gastric cancer cells. DNER silencing elevated the expression of p53, p21cip/waf, and p27, and increased G1 phase cells at the expense of S phase cells. Knockdown of p21cip/waf expression in the DNER-silenced cells partially restored cell viability and S phase progression. DNER silencing also induced the apoptosis of SNU-638 cells. While both cleaved caspases-8 and 9 were detected in adherent cells, only cleaved caspase-8 was found to have increased in spheroid-cultured cells, suggesting a distinct activation pattern of caspase activation depending on the growth condition. Knockdown of p53 expression rescued the DNER-silenced cells from apoptosis and partially restored cell viability. In contrast, overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) decreased the expression of p53, p21cip/waf, and cleaved caspase-3 in DNER-silenced cells. Moreover, NICD expression fully reverted the cell viability reduction, arrest in the G1 phase, and elevated apoptosis caused by DNER silencing, thereby suggesting activation of Notch signaling by DNER. Expression of a membrane-unbound mutant of mDNER also decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis. On the other hand, TGF-β signals were found to be involved in DNER expression in both adherent and spheroid-cultured cells. DNER could therefore be a link connecting TGF-β signaling to Notch signaling. Taken together, DNER regulates cell proliferation, survival, and invasive capacity of the gastric cancer cells through the activation of Notch signaling, which may facilitate tumor progression into an advanced stage. This study provides evidences suggesting that DNER could be a potential prognostic marker, a therapeutic target, and a drug candidate in the form of a cell-free mutant.""","""['Han Thi Ngoc To', 'Ji-Hong Park', 'Jeong Won Kim', 'Dongchul Kang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""[]"""

Cuproptosis is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) have been shown to be effective prognostic biomarkers, yet the link between lncRNAs and cuproptosis remains unclear. We aimed to build a prognostic model of lncRNA risk and explore potential biomarkers of cuproptosis in HCC. Pearson correlations were used to derive lncRNAs co-expressed in cuproptosis. The model was constructed using Cox, Lasso, and multivariate Cox regressions. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, principal components analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve, and nomogram analyses were carried out for validation. Seven lncRNAs were identified as prognostic factors. A risk model was an independent prognostic predictor. Among these seven lncRNAs, prostate cancer associated transcript 6 (PCAT6) is highly expressed in different types of cancer, activating Wnt, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and other pathways; therefore, we performed further functional validation of PCAT6 in HCC. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that PCAT6 was aberrantly highly expressed in HCC cell lines (HepG2 and Hep3B) compared to LO2 (normal hepatocytes). When its expression was knocked down, cells proliferated and migrated less. PCAT6 might be a potential biomarker for predicting prognosis in HCC.""","""['Lihong Yang', 'Xiao Jia', 'Yueyue Fu', 'Jiao Tian', 'Yijin Liu', 'Jianping Lin']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""[]"""

PHB overexpression leads to G1/S-phase cell cycle arrest, and PHB represses the androgen receptor (AR) in prostate cancer cells. PHB interacts with and represses members of the E2F family in a manner that may also be AR-linked, therefore making the AR:PHB:E2F interaction axis highly complex. PHB siRNA increased the growth and metastatic potential of LNCaP mouse xenografts in vivo. Conversely, PHB ectopic cDNA overexpression affected several hundred genes in LNCaP cells. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis showed that in addition to cell cycle regulation, several members of the WNT family were significantly downregulated (WNT7B, WNT9A and WNT10B), as well as pathways for cell adhesion. Online GEO data studies showed PHB expression to be decreased in clinical cases of metastatic prostate cancer, and to be correlated with higher WNT expression in metastasis. PHB overexpression reduced prostate cancer cell migration and motility in wound-healing assays, reduced cell invasion through a Matrigel layer and reduced cellular attachment. In LNCaP cells, WNT7B, WNT9A and WNT10B expression were also upregulated by androgen treatment and downregulated by androgen antagonism, indicating a role for AR in the control of these WNT genes. However, these WNTs were strongly cell cycle regulated. E2F1 cDNA ectopic expression and PHB siRNA (both cell cycle promoting effects) increased WNT7B, WNT9A and WNT10B expression, and these genes were also upregulated as cells were released from G1 to S phase synchronisation, indicating further cell cycle regulation. Therefore, the repressive effects of PHB may inhibit AR, E2F and WNT expression and its loss may increase metastatic potential in human prostate cancer.""","""['Sarah Koushyar', 'Pinar Uysal-Onganer', 'Wen Guo Jiang', 'Dafydd Alwyn Dart']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""[]"""

The deficiency of this mechanism is a frequent event in tumorigenesis. Therapies that exploit defects in HR have been explored essentially in breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, but poorly in colorectal cancers (CRC), although CRC ranks second in mortality worldwide.  Methods:   Tumor specimens and matched healthy tissues from 63 patients with CRC were assessed for gene expression of key HR components and mismatch repair (MMR) status, which correlated with clinicopathological features, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS).  Results:   Enhanced expression of MRE11 homolog (MRE11A), the gene encoding a key molecular actor for resection, is significantly overexpressed in CRC, is associated with the occurrence of primary tumors, particularly T3-T4, and is found in more than 90% of the right-side of CRC, the location with the worst prognosis. Importantly, we also found that high MRE11A transcript abundance is associated with 16.7 months shorter OS and a 3.5 higher risk of death.  Conclusion:   Monitoring of MRE11 expression could be used both as a predictor of outcome and as a marker to select CRC patients for treatments thus far adapted for HR-deficient cancers.""","""['Daniel de Barcellos Azambuja', 'Helena de Castro E Gloria', 'Gabriel E Silva Montenegro', 'Antonio Nocchi Kalil', 'Jean-Sébastien Hoffmann', 'Natalia Motta Leguisamo', 'Jenifer Saffi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Genes (Basel)""","""[]"""

This study aimed to compare the predictive performance of routine H&E or biomarker-assisted ISUP (International Society of Urological Pathology) grade grouping for assessing the risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and clinical recurrence (CR) in patients with prostate cancer. This retrospective study was an assessment of 114 men with prostate cancer who provided radical prostatectomy samples to the Australian Prostate Cancer Bioresource between 2006 and 2014. The prediction of CR was the primary outcome (median time to CR 79.8 months), and BCR was assessed as a secondary outcome (median time to BCR 41.7 months). The associations of (1) H&E ISUP grade groups and (2) modified ISUP grade groups informed by the Appl1, Sortilin and Syndecan-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) labelling were modelled with BCR and CR using Cox proportional hazard approaches. IHC-assisted grading was more predictive than H&E for BCR (C-statistic 0.63 vs. 0.59) and CR (C-statistic 0.71 vs. 0.66). On adjusted analysis, IHC-assisted ISUP grading was independently associated with both outcome measures. IHC-assisted ISUP grading using the biomarker panel was an independent predictor of individual BCR and CR. Prospective studies are needed to further validate this biomarker technology and to define BCR and CR associations in real-world cohorts.""","""['Jessica M Logan', 'Ashley M Hopkins', 'Carmela Martini', 'Alexandra Sorvina', 'Prerna Tewari', 'Sarita Prabhakaran', 'Chelsea Huzzell', 'Ian R D Johnson', 'Shane M Hickey', 'Ben S-Y Ung', 'Joanna Lazniewska', 'Robert D Brooks', 'Courtney R Moore', 'Maria C Caruso', 'Litsa Karageorgos', 'Cara M Martin', ""Sharon O'Toole"", 'Laura Bogue Edgerton', 'Mark P Ward', 'Mark Bates', 'Stavros Selemidis', 'Adrian Esterman', 'Sheena Heffernan', 'Helen Keegan', 'Sarah Ní Mhaolcatha', ""Roisin O'Connor"", 'Victoria Malone', 'Marguerite Carter', 'Katie Ryan', 'Andres Clarke', 'Nathan Brady', 'Sonja Klebe', 'Hemamali Samaratunga', 'Brett Delahunt', 'Michael J Sorich', 'Kim Moretti', 'Lisa M Butler', ""John J O'Leary"", 'Douglas A Brooks']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancers (Basel)""","""[]"""

Recently, tissue engineering for post-prostatectomy ED has been attempted in which controlled interactions between cells, growth factors, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) are important for the structural integrity if nerve regeneration. In this study, we evaluated the effects of a biomechanical ECM patch on the morphology and behavior of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) in a bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) rat model. The ECM patch, made of decellularized human fibroblast-derived ECM (hFDM) and a biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, was tested with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) on a bilateral cavernous nerve injury (BCNI) rat model. In vitro analysis showed that the hFDM/PVA + hBMSCs patches significantly increased neural development markers. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the rats treated with the hFDM/PVA patch had higher ICP/MAP ratios, higher ratios of smooth muscle to collagen, increased nNOS content, higher levels of eNOS protein expression, and higher cGMP levels compared to the BCNI group. These results indicate that the hFDM/PVA patch is effective in promoting angiogenesis, smooth muscle regeneration, and nitrergic nerve regeneration, which could contribute to improved erectile function in post-prostatectomy ED.""","""['Hyong Woo Moon', 'In Gul Kim', 'Mee Young Kim', 'Ae Ryang Jung', 'Kwideok Park', 'Ji Youl Lee']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Bioengineering (Basel)""","""[]"""
