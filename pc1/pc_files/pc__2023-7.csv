The predictive power of the preoperative clinical and pathological indicators for prostate cancer(PC) remains to be improved. To enrich evidence regarding the value of MAOA as a prognostic biomarker in clinical practice, this study explored the significance of MAOA expression as a prognostic marker for patients with PC after radical prostatectomy-pelvic lymph node dissection (RP-PLND).  Methods:   MAOA expression was analyzed in 50 benign prostate tissues and 115 low-intermediate risk and 163 high-risk PC tissues using tissue immunohistochemistry (IHC). Propensity score matching, survival analysis and COX regression analysis were conducted to investigate the correlation between high MAOA expression and progression free survival (PFS) in PC patients.  Results:   MAOA expression was increased in PC patients, especially in those with high risk PC and pathological lymph node (pLN) metastasis. High MAOA expression was significantly associated with PSA recurrence for both low-intermediate risk PC patients (log-rank test: P = 0.02) and high risk PC patients (log-rank test: P = 0.03). Cox regression analysis revealed that high MAOA expression was an adverse prognostic factor for both low-intermediate risk PC patients (hazard ratio [HR] 2.74, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26-5.92; P = 0.011) and high risk PC patients (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.11-2.71; P = 0.016). High MAOA expression was also significantly associated with PSA recurrence in high risk PC patients developed into castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and were receiving abiraterone therapy (log-rank: P = 0.01).  Conclusions:   MAOA expression correlates with the malignant progression of PC. High MAOA expression may be a poor prognostic marker for patients with PC after RP-PLND. More careful follow up or potential of adjuvant hormonal therapy may be addressed for patients with high MAOA expression.""","""['Lingxiao Chen', 'Wei Xiong', 'Lin Qi', 'Wei He']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Urol""","""[]"""

However, the feasibility of delivering exercise training to men with advanced disease and the wider impact on clinical outcomes remain unknown. The purpose of the EXACT trial was to determine the feasibility and effects of home-based exercise training in men with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).  Methods:   Patients with mCRPC receiving ADT + an androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) were prescribed 12 weeks of home-based, remotely monitored, moderate intensity, aerobic and resistance exercise. Feasibility was assessed using recruitment, retention and adherence rates. Safety and adverse events were monitored throughout, with functional and patient-reported outcomes captured at baseline, post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up.  Results:   From the 117 screened, 49 were deemed eligible and approached, with 30 patients providing informed consent (61% recruitment rate). Of those who consented, 28 patients completed baseline assessments, with 24 patients completing the intervention and 22 completing follow-up (retention rates: 86% and 79% respectively). Task completion was excellent throughout, with no intervention-related adverse events recorded. Self-reported adherence to the overall intervention was 82%. Exercise training decreased mean body mass (-1.5%), improved functional fitness (> 10%) and improved several patient-reported outcomes including clinically meaningful changes in fatigue (p = 0.042), FACT-G (p = 0.054) and FACT-P (p = 0.083), all with moderate effect sizes.  Conclusion:   Home-based exercise training, with weekly remote monitoring, was feasible and safe for men with mCRPC being treated with an ARPI. Given that treatment-related toxicities accumulate throughout the course of treatment, and as a result, negatively impact functional fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), it was positive that exercise training improved or prevented a decline in these clinically important variables and could better equip patients for future treatment. Collectively, these preliminary feasibility findings support the need for a definitive, larger RCT, which downstream may lead to the inclusion of home-based exercise training as part of adjuvant care for mCRPC.""","""['Malcolm Brown', 'Marie H Murphy', 'Helen McAneney', 'Ken McBride', 'Ffiona Crawford', 'Aidan Cole', ""Joe M O'Sullivan"", 'Suneil Jain', 'Gillian Prue']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Support Care Cancer""","""[]"""

In this study, we retrospectively investigated the detectability of fluorine-18 (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ([18F]FDG PET/MRI) combined with chest computerized tomography (CT) for early cancer in a large cohort of asymptomatic subjects.  Methods:   This study included a total of 3020 asymptomatic subjects who underwent whole-body [18F]FDG PET/MRI and chest HRCT examinations. All subjects received a 2-4-year follow-up for cancer development. Cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the [18F]FDG PET/MRI with or without chest HRCT were calculated and analyzed.  Results:   Sixty-one subjects were pathologically diagnosed with cancers, among which 59 were correctly detected by [18F]FDG PET/MRI combined with chest HRCT. Of the 59 patients (32 with lung cancer, 9 with breast cancer, 6 with thyroid cancer, 5 with colon cancer, 3 with renal cancer, 1 with prostate cancer, 1 with gastric cancer, 1 with endometrial cancer, and 1 with lymphoma), 54 (91.5%) were at stage 0 or stage I (according to the 8th edition of the tumor-node-metastasis [TNM] staging system), 33 (55.9%) were detected by PET/MRI alone (27 with non-lung cancers and 6 with lung cancer). Cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV for PET/MRI combined with chest CT were 2.0%, 96.7%, 99.6%, 83.1%, and 99.9%, respectively. For PET/MRI alone, the metrics were 1.1%, 54.1%, 99.6%, 73.3%, and 99.1%, respectively, and for PET/MRI in non-lung cancers, the metrics were 0.9%, 93.1%, 99.6%, 69.2%, and 99.9%, respectively.  Conclusions:   [18F]FDG PET/MRI holds great promise for the early detection of non-lung cancers, while it seems insufficient for detecting early-stage lung cancers.

In November 2019, the spectrum of alternative treatment for PCa was added by a novel minimally invasive method, namely high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) using the latest Focal One machine (with the possibility of combining intraoperative ultrasound and preoperative MRI data).  Materials and methods:   During the period from November 2019 to November 2021, HIFU using Focal One device (manufactured by EDAP, France) was performed in 75 patients with PCa. Total ablation was done in 45 cases, while 30 patients undergone to focal prostate ablation. The average age of the patients was 62.7 (51-80) years, the total PSA level was 9.3 (3.2-15.5) ng/ml and the prostate volume was 32.0 (11-35) cc. The maximum urinary rate was 13.3 (6.3-36) ml/s, IPSS score was 7 (3-25) points, IIEF-5 score was 18 (4-25). Clinical stage c1N0M0 was diagnosed in 60 patients, 1bN0M0 in 4 patients, 2N0M0 in 11 patients. In 21 cases, transurethral resection of the prostate was performed within 4-6 weeks prior to total ablation. Before surgery, all patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis with intravenous contrast and PIRADS V2 assessment. MRI data were used intraoperatively for precision planning of the procedure.  Results:   In all patients, the procedure was performed under endotracheal anesthesia in accordance with the technical recommendations of the manufacturer. Prior to surgery, a silicone urethral catheter of 16 or 18 Ch was placed. The average duration of the intervention was 101 (56-147) minutes. The postoperative period was uneventful in all cases.Patients received antibiotic therapy via parenteral route for 4 days, followed by oral administration for another 10 days, as well as alpha-blockers (at least 1 month after procedure). After removal of urethral catheter on the 4th day, all patients started to void. In 9 cases there was acute urinary retention in the evening and in 4 patients in the next morning, requiring temporary bladder catheterization. A year after the procedure, 53 patients were fully examined: the average total PSA level in patients who underwent total ablation (n=53) was 0.96+/-0.11 ng/ml, the IPSS score was 6.9+/-0,6 points (no difference compared to baseline). Follow-up biopsy revealed PCa in 6 patients; in other cases, prostate fibrosis was determined.  Conclusions:   HIFU in patients with localized PCa using image-guided robotic HIFU (Focal One) is promising and feasible. This method has shown good oncological results with a short follow-up period. It is advisable to carry out further prospective analysis.""","""['A V Govorov', 'A O Vasilyev', 'A I Alaverdyan', 'K B Kolontarev', 'D Y Pushkar']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Urologiia""","""[]"""

Herein, we examined whether QoL results correlated with PFS and OS outcomes in phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating new systemic treatments in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  Methods:   The systematic search of PubMed was conducted in October 2022. We identified 81 RCTs testing novel drugs in metastatic NSCLC and published in the English language in a PubMed-indexed journal between 2012 and 2021. Only trials reporting QoL results and at least one survival outcome between OS and PFS were selected. For each RCT, we assessed whether global QoL was ""superior,"" ""inferior,"" or with ""non-statistically significant difference"" in the experimental arm compared to the control arm.  Results:   Experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 30 (37.0%) RCTs and inferior QoL in 3 (3.7%) RCTs. In the remaining 48 (59.3%) RCTs, a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control arms was not found. Of note, we found a statistically significant association between QoL and PFS improvements (X2 = 3.93, p = 0.0473). In more detail, this association was not significant in trials testing immunotherapy or chemotherapy. On the contrary, in RCTs testing target therapies, QoL results positively correlated with PFS outcomes (p = 0.0196). This association was even stronger in the 32 trials testing EGFR or ALK inhibitors (p = 0.0077). On the other hand, QoL results did not positively correlate with OS outcomes (X2 = 0.81, p = 0.368). Furthermore, we found that experimental treatments led to superior QoL in 27/57 (47.4%) trials with positive results and in 3/24 (12.5%) RCTs with negative results (p = 0.0028). Finally, we analyzed how QoL data were described in publications of RCTs in which QoL outcomes were not improved (n = 51). We found that a favorable description of QoL results was associated with sponsorship by industries (p = 0.0232).  Conclusions:   Our study reveals a positive association of QoL results with PFS outcomes in RCTs testing novel treatments in metastatic NSCLC. This association is particularly evident for target therapies. These findings further emphasize the relevance of an accurate assessment of QoL in RCTs in NSCLC.""","""['Alberto Servetto', 'Massimo Di Maio', 'Fabio Salomone', 'Fabiana Napolitano', 'Chiara Paratore', 'Fabrizio Di Costanzo', 'Giuseppe Viscardi', 'Antonio Santaniello', 'Luigi Formisano', 'Roberto Bianco']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""[]"""

We show that C7 is specifically expressed by the stromal cells in both mouse and human prostates. The expression level of C7 inversely correlates with clinical outcomes in prostate cancer. C7 is positively regulated by androgen signaling in the mouse prostate stromal cells. The androgen receptor directly transcriptionally regulates the mouse and human C7. Increasing C7 expression in the C57Bl/6 syngeneic RM-1 and Pten-Kras allografts suppresses tumor growth in vivo. Conversely, C7 haploinsufficiency promotes tumor growth in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model. Interestingly, replenishing C7 in androgen-sensitive Pten-Kras tumors during androgen depletion only slightly enhances cellular apoptosis, highlighting the diverse mechanisms employed by tumors to counteract complement activity.

XG-PANI composites with 3D architectures are obtained by subsequent freeze-drying processes. The morphological investigation highlights the formation of porous structures; UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy characterizations assess the chemical structure of the produced composites. I-V measurements evidence electrical conductivity of the samples, while electrochemical analyses point out their capability to respond to electric stimuli with electron and ion exchanges in physiological-like environment. Trial tests on prostate cancer cells evaluate biocompatibility of the XG-PANI composite. Obtained results demonstrate that a strong acid-free route produces an electrically conductive and electrochemically active XG-PANI polymer composite. The investigation of charge transport and transfer, as well as of biocompatibility properties of composite materials produced in aqueous environments, brings new perspective for exploitation of such materials in biomedical applications.

In this study we develop an oligonucleotide-based assay using electrochemistry for the specific, selective and sensitive detection of a circulating miRNA (miR-141) associated with prostate cancer. In the assay, the excitation and readout of the signal are independent: an electrochemical stimulation followed by an optical readout. A 'sandwich' approach is incorporated, consisting of a biotinylated capture probe immobilised on streptavidin-functionalised surfaces and a detection probe labelled with digoxigenin. We show that the assay allows the detection of miR-141 in human serum, even in the presence of other miRNAs, with a LOD of 0.25 pM.

Malignant transformation by MYC transcriptionally up-regulates the core pre-mRNA splicing machinery and causes misregulation of alternative splicing. However, our understanding of how splicing changes are directed by MYC is limited. We performed a signaling pathway-guided splicing analysis to identify MYC-dependent splicing events. These included an HRAS cassette exon repressed by MYC across multiple tumor types. To molecularly dissect the regulation of this HRAS exon, we used antisense oligonucleotide tiling to identify splicing enhancers and silencers in its flanking introns. RNA-binding motif prediction indicated multiple binding sites for hnRNP H and hnRNP F within these cis-regulatory elements. Using siRNA knockdown and cDNA expression, we found that both hnRNP H and F activate the HRAS cassette exon. Mutagenesis and targeted RNA immunoprecipitation implicate two downstream G-rich elements in this splicing activation. Analyses of ENCODE RNA-seq datasets confirmed hnRNP H regulation of HRAS splicing. Analyses of RNA-seq datasets across multiple cancers showed a negative correlation of HNRNPH gene expression with MYC hallmark enrichment, consistent with the effect of hnRNP H on HRAS splicing. Interestingly, HNRNPF expression showed a positive correlation with MYC hallmarks and thus was not consistent with the observed effects of hnRNP F. Loss of hnRNP H/F altered cell cycle progression and induced apoptosis in the PC3 prostate cancer cell line.

These genomic regions do not directly encode for specific proteins, but can play key roles in cancer progression, for example by driving aberrant gene expression control. Here, we designed an integrative computational and experimental framework to identify recurrently mutated non-coding regulatory regions that drive tumor progression. Application of this approach to whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from a large cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) revealed a large set of recurrently mutated regions. We used (i) in silico prioritization of functional non-coding mutations, (ii) massively parallel reporter assays, and (iii) in vivo CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) screens in xenografted mice to systematically identify and validate driver regulatory regions that drive mCRPC. We discovered that one of these enhancer regions, GH22I030351, acts on a bidirectional promoter to simultaneously modulate expression of U2-associated splicing factor SF3A1 and chromosomal protein CCDC157. We found that both SF3A1 and CCDC157 are promoters of tumor growth in xenograft models of prostate cancer. We nominated a number of transcription factors, including SOX6, to be responsible for higher expression of SF3A1 and CCDC157.

We leverage baseline data from thousands of children in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study to inform the replication sample size required with both univariate and multivariate methods across different imaging modalities to detect reproducible brain-behavior associations. We demonstrate that by applying multivariate methods to high-dimensional brain imaging data, we can capture lower dimensional patterns of structural and functional brain architecture that correlate robustly with cognitive phenotypes and are reproducible with only 42 individuals in the replication sample for working memory-related functional MRI, and ∼100 subjects for structural MRI. Even with 50 subjects in the discovery sample, prediction can be adequately powered with 105 subjects in the replication sample for multivariate prediction of cognition with working memory task functional MRI.

Both sexes also demonstrated an excess risk for synchronous kidney/urinary tract malignancies (SIR = 6.99 in males and 12.11 in females), and women had an increased risk of synchronous breast cancer (SIR = 1.69). CMM male survivors featured a higher risk of metachronous thyroid (SIR = 3.51, 95% CI [1.87, 6.01]), and prostate (SIR = 1.35, 95% CI [1.12, 1.61]) malignancies. Among females, metachronous cancers featured higher SIR values than expected: kidney/urinary tract (SIR = 2.27, 95% CI [1.29, 3.68]), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 2.06, 95% CI [1.24, 3.21]), and breast (SIR = 1.46, 95% CI [1.22, 1.74]). Females had an overall increased risk of metachronous cancers in the first 5 years after CMM diagnosis (SIR = 1.54 at 6-11 months and 1.37 at 1-5 years).  Conclusion:   Among CMM survivors, the risk of metachronous non-skin cancers is higher than in the general population and differs significantly by sex.

The metabolism of arsenic is thought to play a key role in arsenic-related carcinogenesis as metabolites of varying toxicity are produced and either stored in or excreted from the body. Atlantic Canada has the highest age-standardized incidence rates of all cancers in the country. This may be due to its high levels of environmental arsenic and the prevalence of unregulated private wells for water consumption. Here, we aimed to characterize the profiles of arsenic species and metallome in the toenails of four cancer groups, compare them to healthy participants (N = 338), and assess potential associations between the profiles with cancer prevalence.  Methods:   This study employed a case-control design. Toenail samples and questionnaire data from cases (breast, cervical, prostate, and skin cancers) and controls were sourced from the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (PATH) cohort study. The levels of arsenic species were measured using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) paired with High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and total concentrations of metallome (23 metals) were determined by ICP-MS separately. Multivariate analyses were conducted to compare cases with controls within each cancer group.  Results:   Arsenic speciation profiles varied by cancer type and were significantly different between cases and controls in the breast (p = 0.0330), cervical (p = 0.0228), and skin (p = 0.0228) cancer groups. In addition, the profiles of metallome (nine metals) were significantly differentiated in the prostate (p = 0.0244) and skin (p = 0.0321) cancer groups, with higher zinc concentrations among cases compared to controls.  Conclusion:   History of cancer diagnosis was associated with specific profiles of arsenic species and metallome. Our results indicate that arsenic methylation and zinc levels, as measured in toenails, may be an important biomarker for cancer prevalence. Further research is needed to use toenails as a prognostic measure of arsenic-and other metal-induced cancer.""","""['Kalli M Hood', 'Ellen Sweeney', 'Gabriela Ilie', 'Erin Keltie', 'Jong Sung Kim']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Public Health""","""[]"""

Materials and methods:   Biopsy maps of those undergoing MRI-targeted (TB) and systematic biopsy (SB) were reviewed to reclassify systematic cores. Perilesional (PL) cores were defined as adjacent cores within 10 mm of the target lesion (""penumbra"") whilst overlap (OL) cores were defined as cores within the ROI itself (""umbra""). All other cores were designated as distant cores (DC). The incremental csPCa detection rate (GG ≥ 2) and the rate of GG upgrading on prostatectomy as OL, PL and DC sequentially added to TB were determined.  Results:   Out of the 398 patients included, the median number of OL and PL cores was 5 (IQR 4-7) and 5 (IQR 3-6) respectively. OL cores detected more csPCa than PL cores (31 vs 16%, p < 0.001). OL and PL cores improved the csPCa detection rate of TB from 34 to 39% (p < 0.001) and 37% (p = 0.001) respectively. TB+OL+PL had greater csPCa detection compared to just TB+OL (41 vs 39%, p = 0.016) and TB+PL (41 vs 37%, p < 0.001). Of the 104 patients who underwent prostatectomy, GG upgrading rate for TB+OL+PL was lower compared to TB (21 vs 36%, p < 0.001) and was not significantly different compared to TB+OL+PL+DC (21 vs 19%, p = 0.500).

In clinical trials, patients with a history of malignant tumors in the past are usually excluded. It is unknown whether previous cancers affect survival outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of previous malignant tumors on the long-term prognosis of patients with gallbladder cancer.  Methods:   By using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and END Results (SEER) database, we collect patient data and obtain patients who had gallbladder cancer diagnosed in 2004-2015 and had an adaption and contrast 1:1 with cases. We applied the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression models to assess the influence of prior malignancy on gallbladder cancer survival outcomes.  Results:   Among 8338 patients who had mainly gallbladder cancer, 525 (6.3%) suffered prior cancer. Prostate cancer (22.29%), Breast cancer (21.14%), and Genitourinary (14.67%) are the most common types. Before propensity score matching (PSM), two groups of different Kaplan-Meier curves were obtained by classifying previous cancer history, and by comparison, the all-cause difference in the group with previous cancer history was not salience (P = 0.31), but there is a protective effect on the Cancer-specific fatality rate (p < 0.001). Similar results were obtained after propensity score matching (PSM). Among the multivariate Cox analysis, previous malignancy had no obvious relation, including all causes (HR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.86-1.12, p = 0.70) but a better gallbladder cancer-specific survival (HR =0.64, 95% CI: 0.55-0.75, P < 0.001).

The main diagnostic and prognostic reference tool is the Gleason scoring system. An expert pathologist assigns a Gleason grade to a sample of prostate tissue. As this process is very time-consuming, some artificial intelligence applications were developed to automatize it. The training process is often confronted with insufficient and unbalanced databases which affect the generalisability of the models. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a generative deep learning model capable of synthesising patches of any selected Gleason grade to perform data augmentation on unbalanced data and test the improvement of classification models.  Methodology:   The methodology proposed in this work consists of a conditional Progressive Growing GAN (ProGleason-GAN) capable of synthesising prostate histopathological tissue patches by selecting the desired Gleason Grade cancer pattern in the synthetic sample. The conditional Gleason Grade information is introduced into the model through the embedding layers, so there is no need to add a term to the Wasserstein loss function. We used minibatch standard deviation and pixel normalisation to improve the performance and stability of the training process.  Results:   The reality assessment of the synthetic samples was performed with the Frechet Inception Distance (FID). We obtained an FID metric of 88.85 for non-cancerous patterns, 81.86 for GG3, 49.32 for GG4 and 108.69 for GG5 after post-processing stain normalisation. In addition, a group of expert pathologists was selected to perform an external validation of the proposed framework. Finally, the application of our proposed framework improved the classification results in SICAPv2 dataset, proving its effectiveness as a data augmentation method.  Conclusions:   ProGleason-GAN approach combined with a stain normalisation post-processing provides state-of-the-art results regarding Frechet's Inception Distance. This model can synthesise samples of non-cancerous patterns, GG3, GG4 or GG5. The inclusion of conditional information about the Gleason grade during the training process allows the model to select the cancerous pattern in a synthetic sample.

Herein, we investigated the global and local patterns of DNAme perturbations in tumorigenesis by analysing the genome-wide DNAme profiles of the cervix, colorectum, stomach, prostate, and liver at precancerous and cancer stages. We observed global hypomethylation in tissues of both two stages, except for the cervix, whose global DNAme level in normal tissue was lower than that of the other four tumour types. For alterations shared by both stages, there were common hyper-methylation (sHyperMethyl) and hypo-methylation (sHypoMethyl) changes, of which the latter type was more frequently identified in all tissues. Biological pathways interrupted by sHyperMethyl and sHypoMethyl alterations demonstrated significant tissue specificity. DNAme bidirectional chaos indicated by the enrichment of both sHyperMethyl and sHypoMethyl changes in the same pathway was observed in most tissues and was a common phenomenon, particularly in liver lesions. Moreover, for the same enriched pathways, different tissues may be affected by distinct DNAme types. For the PI3K-Akt signalling pathway, sHyperMethyl enrichment was observed in the prostate dataset, but sHypoMethyl enrichment was observed in the colorectum and liver datasets. Nevertheless, they did not show an increased possibility in survival prediction of patients in comparison with other DNAme types. Additionally, our study demonstrated that gene-body DNAme changes of tumour suppressor genes and oncogenes may persist from precancerous lesions to the tumour. Overall, we demonstrate the tissue specificity and commonality of cross-stage alterations in DNA methylation profiles in multi-tissue tumorigenesis.""","""['Feifan Zhang', 'Xin Zhang', 'Haikun Zhang', 'Dongdong Lin', 'Hailang Fan', 'Shicheng Guo', 'Fang An', 'Yaqian Zhao', 'Jun Li', 'Steven J Schrodi', 'Dake Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Epigenetics""","""[]"""

We then evaluated its benefits on image registration.  Methods:   Sixty pairs of 1.5 T MR images acquired with an MR-linac were enrolled. The data included low-speed, high-quality (LSHQ), and high-speed low-quality (HSLQ) MR images. We proposed a CycleGAN, which is based on the data augmentation technique, to learn the mapping between the HSLQ and LSHQ images and then generate synthetic LSHQ (synLSHQ) images from the HSLQ images. Five-fold cross-validation was employed to test the CycleGAN model. The normalized mean absolute error (nMAE), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measurement (SSIM), and edge keeping index (EKI) were calculated to determine image quality. The Jacobian determinant value (JDV), Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and mean distance to agreement (MDA) were used to analyze deformable registration.  Results:   Compared with the LSHQ, the proposed synLSHQ achieved comparable image quality and reduced imaging time by ~ 66%.

Moreover, the ability to leverage deep representation learning in discovery of tumour entities remains unknown.  Methods:   We introduce here Mutation-Attention (MuAt), a deep neural network to learn representations of simple and complex somatic alterations for prediction of tumour types and subtypes. In contrast to many previous methods, MuAt utilizes the attention mechanism on individual mutations instead of aggregated mutation counts.  Results:   We trained MuAt models on 2587 whole cancer genomes (24 tumour types) from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) and 7352 cancer exomes (20 types) from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). MuAt achieved prediction accuracy of 89% for whole genomes and 64% for whole exomes, and a top-5 accuracy of 97% and 90%, respectively. MuAt models were found to be well-calibrated and perform well in three independent whole cancer genome cohorts with 10,361 tumours in total. We show MuAt to be able to learn clinically and biologically relevant tumour entities including acral melanoma, SHH-activated medulloblastoma, SPOP-associated prostate cancer, microsatellite instability, POLE proofreading deficiency, and MUTYH-associated pancreatic endocrine tumours without these tumour subtypes and subgroups being provided as training labels.

However, its use in primary staging is still debated. The aim of this study was to assess accuracy of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in staging patients with intermediate and high risk PCa candidates to radical prostatectomy managed in the Prostate Cancer Unit of our institution.  Methods:   We retrospectively evaluated patients with biopsy-proven PCa staged through PSMA PET/CT before undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND). PET findings were categorized with respect to primary tumor (T), nodal (N) and distant metastasis (M). We analyzed the correspondence between PSMA PET/CT and final histopathological examination.  Results:   We evaluated 42 men with high and intermediate risk PCa submitted to RP with ePLND. Mean age was 65.5 years (range, 49-76 years) and median preoperative prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was 13 ng/mL (IQR, 8.1-20 ng/mL). Patients in the high-risk group were 23 (54.7%), and the remainders were in the intermediate risk group. The mean risk of lymph node involvement (LNI) using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)-nomogram was 20%. The most common International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade was 3 (26.19%) after prostate biopsy. PSMA PET/CT showed focal prostatic uptake in 28 patients [mean value of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 18.5] and detected pelvic lymph node metastases in 6 cases (14.3%) with a median value of SUVmax 4.5 (IQR, 2-6.9). Histopathological examination detected lymph node metastases in seven patients (16.6%). In the only patient with negative PSMA PET/CT pathology revealed the presence of micrometastasis. After histopathological confirmation, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of pre-operative 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT were 85.7%, 100%, 100% and 97%, respectively.  Conclusions:   In our series, 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT holds high overall diagnostic value for lymph node staging in patients with intermediate and high risk PCa.

Using patient surveys, we sought to identify coping mechanisms and assess characteristics associated with lower financial toxicity.  Materials and methods:   Surveys were administered to all patients seen at a single center's Advanced Prostate Cancer Clinic over a 3-month period. Surveys included the COST-FACIT (COmprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity) and coping mechanism questionnaires. Patients with metastatic disease (lymph nodes, bone, visceral) were included for analysis. Coping mechanisms were compared between patients experiencing low (COST-FACIT >24) vs high (COST-FACIT ≤24) financial toxicity using Fisher's exact test. Multivariable linear regression was used to evaluate characteristics associated with lower financial toxicity.  Results:   Overall, 281 patients met inclusion criteria of which 79 reported high financial toxicity. In multivariable analysis, characteristics associated with lower financial toxicity included older age (estimate: 0.36, 95%CI: 0.21-0.52), applying for patient assistance programs (estimate: 4.42, 95%CI: 1.72-7.11), and an annual income of at least $100,000 (estimate: 7.81, 95%CI: 0.97, 14.66). Patients with high financial toxicity were more likely to decrease spending on basic goods (35% vs 2.5%, P < .001) and leisure activities (59% vs 15%, P > .001), as well as use savings (62% vs 17%, P < .001) to pay for their treatment.  Conclusions:   In this cross-sectional study, patients with metastatic prostate cancer and high financial toxicity were more likely to decrease spending on basic goods and leisure activities and use savings to pay for care.

Developing non-invasive tools to detect the biochemical changes that correlate with drug efficacy and reveal the onset of drug resistance would have important ramifications in managing the treatment regimen for individual patients. Here, we report the selection of new Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) that show high affinity toward prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a biomarker used in clinical monitoring of prostate cancer. Ribosome display and in vitro screening tools were used to select PSA-binding DARPins based on their binding affinity, selectivity, and chemical constitution. Surface plasmon resonance measurements demonstrated that the four lead candidates bind to PSA with nanomolar affinity. DARPins were site-specifically functionalised at a unique C-terminal cysteine with a hexadentate aza-nonamacrocyclic chelate (NODAGA) for subsequent radiolabelling with the positron-emitting radionuclide 68Ga. [68Ga]GaNODAGA-DARPins showed high stability toward transchelation and were stable in human serum for >2 h. Radioactive binding assays using streptavidin-loaded magnetic beads confirmed that the functionalisation and radiolabelling did not compromise the specificity of [68Ga]GaNODAGA-DARPins toward PSA. Biodistribution experiments in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous prostate cancer xenografts derived from the LNCaP cell line revealed that three of the four [68Ga]GaNODAGA-DARPins displayed specific tumour-binding in vivo. For DARPin-6, tumour-uptake in the normal group reached 4.16 ± 0.58% ID g-1 (n = 3; 2 h post-administration) and was reduced by ∼50% by competitive binding with a low molar activity formulation (blocking group: 2.47 ± 0.42% ID g-1; n = 3; P value = 0.018). Collectively, the experimental results support the future development of new PSA-specific imaging agents for potential use in monitoring the efficacy of androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies.""","""['Melanie Gut', 'Birgit Dreier', 'Sven Furler', 'Jens Sobek', 'Andreas Plückthun', 'Jason P Holland']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""RSC Chem Biol""","""[]"""

We aimed to investigate the correlation between accuracy and biopsy core number, performed immunohistochemical staining (IHC) or prostatectomy specimen sampling, with the latest also being correlated with higher detection rates of adverse pathological features, e.g., positive surgical margins, higher pathological stage or presence of perineural invasion (PnI status). The study cohort consisted of 315 consecutive patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma via transrectal ultrasound-guided needle biopsy who later underwent radical prostatectomy. We grouped and compared patients based on Grade Group accuracy, presence of IHC on biopsy, margin status, pathological stage, and PnI status. Inter-observer reproducibility was also calculated. Statistical analyzes included ANOVA, Tukey's multiple comparisons post hoc test, Chi-squared test, and Fleiss kappa statistics. Undergraded cases harboured a significantly lower number of biopsy cores (p < 0.05), than accurately graded cases. Using IHC did not affect grading accuracy significantly, nor did the number of slides from prostatectomy specimens. The mean number of slides was virtually identical when margin status, pathological stage and PnI status of prostatectomy specimens were compared. Inter-observer reproducibility at our institute was calculated as fair (overall kappa = 0.29).

Colon (HT29 and HCT116) and prostate carcinoma (DU145) cell lines, as well as human normal BJ fibroblasts, were treated up to 72 h with 2-40 MBq/mL 64CuCl2. Radioisotope uptake and retention were assessed, and cell viability/death, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and the expression of 84 stress genes were investigated at various time points after [64Cu]CuCl2 addition. All the investigated cells incorporated 64Cu ions similarly, independent of their tumoral or normal status, but their fate after exposure to [64Cu]CuCl2 was cell-dependent. The most striking cytotoxic effects of the radioisotope were registered in colon carcinoma HCT116 cells, for which a substantial decrease in the number of metabolically active cells, and an increased DNA damage and oxidative stress were registered. The stress gene expression study highlighted the activation of both death and repair mechanisms in these cells, related to extrinsic apoptosis, necrosis/necroptosis or autophagy, and cell cycle arrest, nucleotide excision repair, antioxidant, and hypoxic responses, respectively. The in vitro study indicated that 40 MBq/mL [64Cu]CuCl2 delivers a therapeutic effect in human colon carcinoma, but its use is limited by harmful, yet lower effects on normal fibroblasts. The exposure of tumor cells to 20 MBq/mL [64Cu]CuCl2, might be used for a softer approach aiming for a lower radiotoxicity in normal fibroblasts as compared to tumor cells.

The primary goal of this study was to evaluate financial factors leading to worsening health outcomes by the cancer subtype. A logistic model predicting worsening health outcomes while assessing the most influential economic factors was constructed by the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study. A forward stepwise regression procedure was implemented to identify the social risk factors that impact health status. Stepwise regression was done on data subsets based on the cancer types of lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer to determine whether significant predictors of worsening health status were different or the same across cancer types. Independent covariate analysis was also conducted to cross-validate our model. On the basis of the model fit statistics, the two-factor model has the best fit, that is, the lowest AIC among potential models of 3270.56, percent concordance of 64.7, and a C-statistics of 0.65. The two-factor model used work impairment and out-of-pocket costs, significantly contributing to worsening health outcomes. Covariate analysis demonstrated that younger patients with cancer experienced more financial burdens leading to worsening health outcomes than elderly patients aged 65 years and above. Work impairment and high out-of-pocket costs were significantly associated with worsening health outcomes among cancer patients. Matching the participants who need the most financial help with appropriate resources is essential to mitigate the financial burden.  Significance:   Among patients with cancer, work impairment and out-of-pocket are the two primary factors contributing to adverse health outcomes.

KMT2C is mainly involved in enhancer-associated H3K4me1, and is also one of the top mutated genes in cancer (6.6% in pan-cancer). Currently, the clinical significance of KMT2C mutations in prostate cancer is understudied.  Methods:   We included 221 prostate cancer patients diagnosed between 2014 and 2021 in West China Hospital of Sichuan University with cell-free DNA-based liquid biopsy test results in this study. We investigated the association between KMT2C mutations, other mutations, and pathways. Furthermore, we evaluated the prognostic value of KMT2C mutations, measured by overall survival (OS) and castration resistance-free survival (CRFS). Also, we explored the prognostic value of KMT2C mutations in different patient subgroups. Lastly, we investigated the predictive value of KMT2C mutations in individuals receiving conventional combined anti-androgen blockade (CAB) and abiraterone (ABI) as measured by PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS).  Results:   The KMT2C mutation rate in this cohort is 7.24% (16/221). KMT2C-mutated patients showed worse survival than KMT2C-wild type (WT) patients regarding both CRFS and OS (CRFS: mutated: 9.9 vs. WT: 22.0 months, p = 0.015; OS: mutated: 71.9 vs. WT 137.4 months, p = 0.012). KMT2C mutations were also an independent risk factor in OS [hazard ratio: 3.815 (1.461, 9.96), p = 0.006] in multivariate analyses. Additionally, we explored the association of KMT2C mutations with other genes. This showed that KMT2C mutations were associated with Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase 11 (STK11, p = 0.004) and Catenin Beta 1 (CTNNB1, p = 0.008) mutations. In the CAB treatment, KMT2C-mutated patients had a significantly shorter PSA-PFS compared to KMT2C-WT patients. (PSA-PFS: mutated: 9.9 vs. WT: 17.6 months, p = 0.014). Moreover, KMT2C mutations could effectively predict shorter PSA-PFS in 10 out of 23 subgroups and exhibited a strong trend in the remaining subgroups.  Conclusions: KMT2C-mutated patients showed worse survival compared to KMT2C-WT patients in terms of both CRFS and OS, and KMT2C mutations were associated with STK11 and CTNNB1 mutations. Furthermore, KMT2C mutations indicated rapid progression during CAB therapy and could serve as a potential biomarker to predict therapeutic response in prostate cancer.""","""['Sha Zhu', 'Nanwei Xu', 'Jiayu Liang', 'Fengnian Zhao', 'Zilin Wang', 'Yuchao Ni', 'Jindong Dai', 'Jinge Zhao', 'Xingming Zhang', 'Junru Chen', 'Guangxi Sun', 'Pengfei Shen', 'Hao Zeng']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Oncol Res""","""[]"""

Methods:   We evaluated a PRS using 21 BPH/PV-associated SNPs, two established PCa risk-related PRS and 10 guideline-recommended hereditary cancer risk genes in the population-based UK Biobank cohort (N = 209,502).  Results:   The BPH/PV PRS was significantly inversely associated with the incidence of lethal PCa as well as the natural progress in PCa patients (hazard ratio, HR = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.87-0.98, P = 0.02; HR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98, P = 0.01).

Elevated expression of the Bloom's syndrome protein (BLM) helicase has emerged as a promising cancer biomarker, being associated with the onset and progression of PCa. Nevertheless, the precise molecular mechanisms governing BLM regulation in PCa remain elusive.  Methods:   The expression of BLM in human specimens was analyzed using immnohistochemistry (IHC). A 5'-biotin-labeled DNA probe containing the promoter region of BLM was synthesized to pull down BLM promoter-binding proteins. Functional studies were conducted using a range of assays, including CCK-8, EdU incorporation, clone formation, wound scratch, transwell migration, alkaline comet assay, xenograft mouse model, and H&E staining. Mechanistic studies were carried out using various techniques, including streptavidin-agarose-mediated DNA pull-down, mass spectrometry (MS), immunofluorescence (IF), dual luciferase reporter assay system, RT-qPCR, ChIP-qPCR, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), and western blot.  Results:   The results revealed significant upregulation of BLM in human PCa tissues, and its overexpression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis in PCa patients. Increased BLM expression showed significant correlations with advanced clinical stage (P = 0.022) and Gleason grade (P = 0.006). In vitro experiments demonstrated that BLM knockdown exerted inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, clone formation, invasion, and migration. Furthermore, PARP1 (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) was identified as a BLM promoter-binding protein. Further investigations revealed that the downregulation of PARP1 led to increased BLM promoter activity and expression, while the overexpression of PARP1 exerted opposite effects. Through mechanistic studies, we elucidated that the interaction between PARP1 and HSP90AB1 (heat shock protein alpha family class B) enhanced the transcriptional regulation of BLM by counteracting the inhibitory influence of PARP1 on BLM. Furthermore, the combination treatment of olaparib with ML216 demonstrated enhanced inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, clone formation, invasion, and migration. It also induced more severe DNA damage in vitro and exhibited superior inhibitory effects on the proliferation of PC3 xenograft tumors in vivo.  Conclusions:   The results of this study underscore the significance of BLM overexpression as a prognostic biomarker for PCa, while also demonstrating the negative regulatory impact of PARP1 on BLM transcription. The concurrent targeting of BLM and PARP1 emerges as a promising therapeutic approach for PCa treatment, holding potential clinical significance.""","""['Mengqiu Huang', 'Lin Chen', 'Yingchu Guo', 'Yong Ruan', 'Houqiang Xu']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Transl Med""","""[]"""

Here, we explored immune checkpoint molecule expression in NK and CRPC cells during their interactions, and identified that the T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif domain (TIGIT) monoclonal antibody (mAb), vibostolimab, significantly enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity against CRPC cells and cytokine production in vitro, demonstrated by upregulation of degranulation marker CD107a and Fas-ligand (Fas-L) and increased interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion. TIGIT blockade increased Fas-L expression and IFN-γ production via the NF-κB signaling pathway and restored degranulation via the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase/ERK pathway in activated NK cells. Vibostolimab significantly enhanced NK cell antitumor effects against CRPC in two xenograft mouse models. Vibostolimab also increased T cell chemotaxis induced by activated NK cells in vitro and in vivo.

Although some modifiable factors have been identified as the risk factors for PCa, the effect of lower ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids intake (N-6/N-3) remains unknown. Previous studies of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) reported a significant positive association between PCa and selected organophosphate pesticides (OPs) including terbufos and fonofos.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between N-6/N-3 and PCa and any interaction between N-6/N-3 and 2 selected OPs (i.e., terbufos and fonofos) exposure.  Design and participants:   This case-control study, nested within a prospective cohort study, was conducted on a subgroup of the AHS population (1193 PCa cases and 14,872 controls) who returned their dietary questionnaire between 1999 and 2003 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PCa was coded based on the International Classification of Diseases of Oncology (ICD-O-3) definitions and obtained from the statewide cancer registries of Iowa (2003-2017) and North Carolina (2003-2014).  Statistical analysis:   Multivariate logistic regression analysis was applied to obtain the odds ratios adjusted (aORs) for age at dietary assessment (years), race/ethnicity (white, African American, other), physical activity (hours/week), smoking (yes/no), terbufos (yes/no), fonofos (yes/no), diabetes, lycopene intake (milligrams/day), family history of PCa, and the interaction of N-6/N-3 with age, terbufos and fonofos. Pesticide exposure was assessed by self-administrated questionnaires collecting data on ever/never use of mentioned pesticides during lifetime as a yes/no variable. Assessing the P value for the interaction between pesticides and N-6/N-3, we used the continuous variable of ""intensity adjusted cumulative exposure"" to terbufos and fonofos. This exposure score was based on duration, intensity and frequency of exposure. We also conducted a stratified regression analysis by quartiles of age.  Results:   Relative to the highest N-6/N-3 quartile, the lowest quartile was significantly associated with a decreased risk of PCa (aOR=0.61, 95% CI: 0.41-0.90), and quartile-specific aORs decreased toward the lowest quartile (Ptrend=<0.01). Based on the age-stratified analysis, the protective effect was only significant for the lowest quartile of N-6/N-3 among those aged between 48 and 55 years old (aORs=0.97, 95% CI, 0.45-0.55). Among those who were exposed to terbufos (ever exposure reported as yes in the self-report questionnaires), lower quartiles of N-6/N-3 were protective albeit nonsignificant (aORs: 0.86, 0.92, 0.91 in quartiles 1,2, and 3, respectively). No meaningful findings were observed for fonofos and N-6/N-3 interaction.  Conclusion:   Findings showed that lower N-6/N-3 may decrease risk of PCa among farmers. However, no significant interaction was found between selected organophosphate pesticides and N-6/N-3.""","""['Homa Sadeghi', 'Charles F Lynch', 'William R Field', 'Linda G Snetselaar', 'Michael P Jones', 'Rashmi Sinha', 'James C Torner']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Epidemiol""","""[]"""

However, drug testing efforts suffer from a large variation in experimental conditions for organoid culturing and organoid treatment. Moreover, most drug tests are restricted to whole-well viability as the sole read-out, thereby losing important information about key biological aspects that might be impacted due to the use of administered drugs. These bulk read-outs also discard potential inter-organoid heterogeneity in drug responses. To tackle these issues, we developed a systematic approach for processing organoids from prostate cancer (PCa) patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) for viability-based drug testing and identified essential conditions and quality checks for consistent results. In addition, we generated an imaging-based drug testing procedure using high-content fluorescence microscopy in living PCa organoids to detect various modalities of cell death. Individual organoids and cell nuclei in organoids were segmented and quantified using a dye combination of Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide and Caspase 3/7 Green, allowing the identification of cytostatic and cytotoxic treatment effects. Our procedures provide important insights into the mechanistic actions of tested drugs.

As cancer cells have increased proteotoxic stress, targeting proteotoxic stress-related pathways such as endoplasmic reticulum stress is attracting attention as a new anticancer treatment. One of the downstream responses to endoplasmic reticulum stress is endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), a major degradation pathway that facilitates proteasome-dependent degradation of unfolded or misfolded proteins. Recently, SVIP (small VCP/97-interacting protein), an endogenous ERAD inhibitor, has been implicated in cancer progression, especially in glioma, prostate, and head and neck cancers. Here, the data of several RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and gene array studies were combined to evaluate the SVIP gene expression analysis on a variety of cancers, with a particular focus on breast cancer. The mRNA level of SVIP was found to be significantly higher in primary breast tumors and correlated well with its promoter methylation status and genetic alterations. Strikingly, the SVIP protein level was found to be low despite increased mRNA levels in breast tumors compared to normal tissues. On the other hand, the immunoblotting analysis showed that the expression of SVIP protein was significantly higher in breast cancer cell lines compared to non-tumorigenic epithelial cell lines, while most of the key proteins of gp78-mediated ERAD did not exhibit such an expression pattern, except for Hrd1. Silencing of SVIP enhanced the proliferation of p53 wt MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cells but not p53 mutant T47D and SK-BR-3 cells; however, it increased the migration ability of both types of cell lines. Importantly, our data suggest that SVIP may increase p53 protein levels in MCF7 cells by inhibiting Hrd1-mediated p53 degradation.

To evaluate the reliability of the protocol, interobserver variability was assessed between five pathologists, who annotated ten radical prostatectomy specimens consisting of 74 whole mount pathology slides. Interobserver variability was assessed for both the localization and grading of PCa. The results indicate excellent overall agreement on the localization of PCa (Gleason pattern ≥ 3) and clinically significant PCa (Gleason pattern ≥ 4), with Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of 0.91 and 0.88, respectively. On a per-slide level, agreement for primary and secondary Gleason pattern was almost perfect and substantial, with Fleiss Kappa of .819 (95% CI .659-.980) and .726 (95% CI .573-.878), respectively. Agreement on International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group was evaluated for the index lesions and showed agreement in 70% of cases, with a mean DSC of 0.92 for all index lesions. These findings show that a standardized protocol for prostatectomy pathology annotation provides reliable data on PCa localization and grading, with relatively high levels of interobserver agreement.

It has become an important treatment option in metastasized neuroendocrine tumors and advanced prostate cancer. The analysis of absorbed doses in radioligand therapies has gained much attention and remains a challenging task due to individual pharmacokinetics. As an alternative to the often used sum of exponential functions in intra-therapeutic dosimetry, a basic compartmental model for the pharmacokinetics of radioligands is described and analyzed in this paper. In its simplest version, the model behavior is determined by the uptake capacity and the association constant and can be solved analytically. The model is extended with rates for excretion from the source compartment and externalization from the lesion compartment. Numerical calculations offer an insight into the quantitative effects of the model parameters on the absorbed dose in the tumor lesion. This analysis helps understanding the importance of clinically relevant factors, e.g. the effect on absorbed doses of modified radioligands that bind to albumin. Using clinical data, the potential application in intra-therapeutic dosimetry is illustrated and compared to the bi-exponential function which lacks a mechanistical basis. While the compartmental model is found to constitute a feasible alternative in these examples, this has to be confirmed by further clinical studies.""","""['M Galler', 'C Chibolela', 'J M M Rogasch', 'K Huang', 'J Siefert', 'I Schatka', 'H Amthauer']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biomed Phys Eng Express""","""[]"""

A variable incidence of POUR has previously been reported in this context, and contradictory evidence surrounds potential risk factors.  Objective:   To ascertain the incidence of, explore risk factors for, and determine the health service outcomes of POUR following elective IHR.  Design, setting, and participants:   The Retention of Urine After Inguinal Hernia Elective Repair (RETAINER I) study, an international, prospective cohort study, recruited participants between March 1 and October 31, 2021. This study was conducted across 209 centers in 32 countries in a consecutive sample of adult patients undergoing elective IHR.  Exposure:   Open or minimally invasive IHR by any surgical technique, under local, neuraxial regional, or general anesthesia.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was the incidence of POUR following elective IHR. Secondary outcomes were perioperative risk factors, management, clinical consequences, and health service outcomes of POUR. A preoperative International Prostate Symptom Score was measured in male patients.  Results:   In total, 4151 patients (3882 male and 269 female; median [IQR] age, 56 [43-68] years) were studied. Inguinal hernia repair was commenced via an open surgical approach in 82.2% of patients (n = 3414) and minimally invasive surgery in 17.8% (n = 737). The primary form of anesthesia was general in 40.9% of patients (n = 1696), neuraxial regional in 45.8% (n = 1902), and local in 10.7% (n = 446). Postoperative urinary retention occurred in 5.8% of male patients (n = 224), 2.97% of female patients (n = 8), and 9.5% (119 of 1252) of male patients aged 65 years or older. Risk factors for POUR after adjusted analyses included increasing age, anticholinergic medication, history of urinary retention, constipation, out-of-hours surgery, involvement of urinary bladder within the hernia, temporary intraoperative urethral catheterization, and increasing operative duration. Postoperative urinary retention was the primary reason for 27.8% of unplanned day-case surgery admissions (n = 74) and 51.8% of 30-day readmissions (n = 72).  Conclusions:   The findings of this cohort study suggest that 1 in 17 male patients, 1 in 11 male patients aged 65 years or older, and 1 in 34 female patients may develop POUR following IHR.

Consequently, we aim to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for abiraterone via a middle-out approach to prospectively interrogate the untested, albeit clinically relevant, scenarios.  Methods:   To characterize in vivo hydrolysis of prodrug abiraterone acetate (AA) and supersaturation of abiraterone, in vitro aqueous solubility data, biorelevant measurements, and supersaturation and precipitation parameters were utilized for mechanistic absorption simulation. CYP3A4-mediated N-oxidation and sulfotransferase 2A1-catalyzed sulfation of abiraterone were subsequently quantified in human liver subcellular systems. Iterative PBPK model refinement involved evaluation of potential organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)-mediated abiraterone uptake in transfected cells in the absence and presence of albumin.  Results:   The developed PBPK model recapitulated the duodenal concentration-time profile of both AA and abiraterone after simulated AA administration. Our findings established abiraterone as a substrate of hepatic OATP1B3 to recapitulate its unbound metabolic intrinsic clearance. Further consideration of a transporter-induced protein-binding shift established accurate translational scaling factors and extrapolated the sinusoidal uptake process. Subsequent simulations effectively predicted the PK of abiraterone upon single and multiple dosing.

The patient underwent thoracoscopic pulmonary metastasectomy with a diagnosis of repeat oligoprogressive castration-resistant prostate cancer. Only androgen deprivation therapy was continued and his prostate-specific antigen levels remained undetectable for 9 months after surgery.  Conclusion:   Our case suggests that progressive site-directed therapy may be effective for carefully selected repeat OP-CRPC with a lung metastasis.""","""['Takahiko Soma', 'Soichiro Yoshida', 'Ryo Wakejima', 'Towako Taguchi', 'Shohei Fukuda', 'Hajime Tanaka', 'Minato Yokoyama', 'Kenichi Ohashi', 'Kenichi Okubo', 'Yasuhisa Fujii']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""IJU Case Rep""","""[]"""

Materials and methods:   One hundred and six patients with hpIDC-P, 105 with lpIDC-P and 168 with PAC, who underwent pretreatment multiparametric MRI between January 2015 and December 2020 were included in this study. Imaging parameters, including invasiveness and metastasis, were evaluated and compared between the PAC and IDC-P groups as well as between the hpIDC-P and lpIDC-P subgroups. Nomograms for distinguishing IDC-P from PAC, and hpIDC-P from lpIDC-P and PAC, were made using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The discrimination performance of the models was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) in the sample, where the models were derived from without an independent validation sample.  Results:   The tumor diameter was larger and invasive and metastatic features were more common in the IDC-P than in the PAC group (P < 0.001). The distribution of extraprostatic extension (EPE) and pelvic lymphadenopathy was even greater, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) ratio was lower in the hpIDC-P than in the lpIDC-P group (P < 0.05). The ROC-AUCs of the stepwise models based solely on imaging features for distinguishing IDC-P from PAC and hpIDC-P from lpIDC-P and PAC were 0.797 (95% confidence interval, 0.750-0.843) and 0.777 (0.727-0.827), respectively.  Conclusion:   IDC-P was more likely to be larger, more invasive, and more metastatic, with obviously restricted diffusion. EPE, pelvic lymphadenopathy, and a lower ADC ratio were more likely to occur in hpIDC-P, and were also the most useful variables in both nomograms for predicting IDC-P and hpIDC-P.""","""['Ling Yang#', 'Xue-Ming Li#', 'Meng-Ni Zhang', 'Jin Yao', 'Bin Song']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Korean J Radiol""","""[]"""

The phase 2 GALAHAD trial (NCT02854436) demonstrated that niraparib monotherapy is tolerable and efficacious in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene alterations, particularly those with breast cancer gene (BRCA) alterations who had progressed on prior androgen signaling inhibitor therapy and taxane-based chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the prespecified patient-reported outcomes analysis from GALAHAD. METHODS: Eligible patients with alterations to BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 (BRCA cohort) and with pathogenic alterations in other HRR genes (other HRR cohort) were enrolled and received niraparib 300 mg once daily. Patient-reported outcome instruments included the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate and the Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form. Changes from baseline were compared using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures. RESULTS: On average, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) improved in the BRCA cohort by cycle 3 (mean change = 6.03; 95% CI = 2.76-9.29) and was maintained above baseline until cycle 10 (mean change = 2.84; 95% CI = -1.95 to 7.63), whereas the other HRR cohort showed no early change in HRQoL from baseline (mean change = -0.07; 95% CI = -4.69 to 4.55) and declined by cycle 10 (mean change = -5.10; 95% CI = -15.3 to 5.06). Median time to deterioration in pain intensity and pain interference could not be estimated in either cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced mCRPC and BRCA alterations treated with niraparib experienced more meaningful improvement in overall HRQoL, pain intensity, and pain interference compared with those with other HRR alterations. In this population of castrate, heavily pretreated patients with mCRPC and HRR alterations, stabilization, and improvement in HRQoL may be relevant to consider when making treatment decisions.

However, the evaluation of their properties such as surface functionality and biodegradability is still challenging, which has a significant impact on the efficiency of chemotherapy. In this study, we have applied direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), a single-molecule super-resolution microscopy technique, to quantify the degradation of nanoPMOs triggered by glutathione and the multivalency of antibody-conjugated nanoPMOs. Subsequently, the effect of these properties on cancer cell targeting, drug loading and release capability, and anticancer activity is also studied. Due to the higher spatial resolution at the nanoscale, dSTORM imaging is able to reveal the structural properties (i.e., size and shape) of fluorescent and biodegradable nanoPMOs. The quantification of nanoPMOs' biodegradation using dSTORM imaging demonstrates their excellent structure-dependent degradation behavior at a higher glutathione concentration. The surface functionality of anti-M6PR antibody-conjugated nanoPMOs as quantified by dSTORM imaging plays a key role in prostate cancer cell labeling: oriented antibody is more effective than random ones, while high multivalency is also effective. The higher biodegradability and cancer cell-targeting properties of nanorods conjugated with oriented antibody (EAB4H) effectively deliver the anticancer drug doxorubicin to cancer cells, exhibiting potent anticancer effects.""","""['Pradip Das', 'Silvia Pujals', 'Lamiaa M A Ali', 'Magali Gary-Bobo', 'Lorenzo Albertazzi', 'Jean-Olivier Durand']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Nanoscale""","""[]"""

Although progesterone is the most abundant sex steroid in orchiectomized (ORX) male mice, the origins of progesterone in males are unclear. To determine the origins of progesterone and androgens, we first determined the effect of ORX, adrenalectomy (ADX), or both (ORX + ADX) on progesterone levels in multiple male mouse tissues. As expected, intratissue androgen levels were mainly testicular derived. Interestingly, progesterone levels remained high after ORX and ORX + ADX with the highest levels in white adipose tissue and in the gastrointestinal tract. High progesterone levels were observed in mouse chow and exceptionally high progesterone levels were observed in food items such as dairy, eggs, and beef, all derived from female animals of reproductive age. To determine if orally ingested progesterone contributes to tissue levels of progesterone in males, we treated ORX + ADX and sham mice with isotope-labeled progesterone or vehicle by oral gavage. We observed a significant uptake of labeled progesterone in white adipose tissue and prostate, suggesting that dietary progesterone may contribute to tissue levels of progesterone. In conclusion, although adrenal-derived progesterone contributes to intratissue progesterone levels in males, nonadrenal progesterone sources also contribute. We propose that dietary progesterone is absorbed and contributes to intratissue progesterone levels in male mice. We speculate that food with high progesterone content could be a significant source of progesterone in males, possibly with consequences for men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.""","""['Hannah Colldén', 'Malin Hagberg Thulin', 'Andreas Landin', 'Karin Horkeby', 'Marie Lagerquist', 'Jianyao Wu', 'Karin H Nilsson', 'Louise Grahnemo', 'Matti Poutanen', 'Henrik Ryberg', 'Liesbeth Vandenput', 'Claes Ohlsson']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Endocrinology""","""[]"""

Although ADT is effective treatment, with virtually all men with advanced disease showing initial clinical response, it is associated with troublesome side effects including hot flushes and night sweats (HFNS). HFNS can be both frequent and severe and can have a significant impact on quality of life (QoL). They can occasionally be so debilitating that patients stop ADT altogether, despite the increased risk of disease relapse or death. Previous research has found that guided self-help cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can be effective in reducing HFNS due to ADT when delivered by a clinical psychologist. MANCAN2 aims test whether we can train the existing NHS Prostate Cancer Nurse Specialist (CNS) team to deliver guided self-help CBT and whether it is effective in reducing the impact of HFNS in men undergoing ADT.  Methods:   MANCAN2 is a phase III multicentre randomised controlled trial and process evaluation. Between 144 and 196 men with prostate cancer who are currently receiving ADT and are experiencing problematic HFNS will be individually randomised in a 1:1 ratio in groups of 6-8 participants to either treatment as usual (TAU) or participation in the guided self-help CBT intervention plus TAU. A process evaluation using the normalisation process theory (NPT) framework will be conducted, to understand the CNS team's experiences of delivering the intervention and to establish the key influencers to its implementation as a routine practice service. Fidelity of implementation of the intervention will be conducted by expert assessment. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention and participant adherence to the trial intervention will also be assessed.  Discussion:   MANCAN2 will advance the program of work already conducted in development of management strategies for HFNS. This research will determine whether the severity of ADT-induced HFNS in men with prostate cancer can be reduced by a guided self-help CBT intervention, delivered by the existing NHS prostate cancer CNS team, within a multicentre study. The emphasis on this existing team, if successful, should facilitate translation through to implementation in routine practice.  Trial registration:   ISRCTN reference 58720120 .

Methods:   In this study, we analyzed the expression of miR-183-5p in PCa patients and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters based on TCGA data portal. CCK-8, migration assay and invasion and wound-healing assay were performed to detect proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa cells.  Results:   We found the expression of miR-183-5p was significantly increased in PCa tissues, and high expression of miR-183 was positively associated with poor prognosis of PCa patients. Over-expression of miR-183-5p promoted the migration, invasion capacities of PCa cells, whereas knockdown of miR-183-5p showed reversed function. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay showed TET1 was identified as a direct target of miR-183-5p, which was negatively correlation with miR-183-5p expression level. Importantly, rescue experiments demonstrated TET1 over-expression could reverse miR-183-5p mimic induced-acceleration of PCa malignant progression.

Methods:   Smart Pace (SP) and Prostate 8 (P8) were two 12-week pilot randomized controlled trials (RCTs) among 42 colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors and 76 prostate cancer (PC) survivors, respectively, that encouraged participants to implement exercise (both) and healthy diet (P8 only) through text messaging and wearable fitness monitors; P8 also included web materials. Participants completed surveys on perceived barriers and confidence in their ability to implement healthy behaviors at enrollment and 12 weeks; P8 also included a 52-week assessment.  Results:   At enrollment, CRC survivors commonly reported a lack of discipline/willpower (36%), time (33%), and energy (31%); PC survivors often reported a lack of knowledge about healthy dietary behaviors (26%). Not having anyone with whom to exercise with was a common barrier among both groups (21% in CRC, 20% in PC). Among the intervention groups in both studies, various enrollment barriers (overall, functional/psychological disability, aversiveness, excuses, and inconveniences) were associated with change in behavior over time.  Conclusions:   Among CRC and PC survivors, there are multiple potential barriers related to motivation, time, social support, and lack of knowledge, that can be addressed and overcome to improve healthy behaviors.

In this study, we examine the value of pre-screening calcaneal QUS in identifying patients who should be referred for screening for osteoporosis using dual-energy X-Ray absorptiometry (DXA). In a single-center retrospective cross-sectional cohort study, we analysed data on DXA and calcaneal QUS measurements systematically collected between 2011 and 2013 in all non-metastatic PCa patients attending our Uro-Oncological Clinic at the Leiden University Medical Center. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values of QUS T-scores of 0, -1.0, and - 1.8 in identifying DXA-diagnosed osteoporosis (T-scores ≤ - 2.5 and ≤ -2) at lumbar spine and/or femoral neck. Complete sets of data were available in 256 patients, median age 70.9 (53.6-89.5) years; 93.0 % had received local treatment, 84.4 % with additional ADT. Prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia was respectively 10.5 % and 53 %. Mean QUS T-score was -0.54 ± 1.58. Whereas PPV at any QUS T-score was <25 %, precluding the use of QUS as surrogate for DXA in screening for osteoporosis, QUS T-scores of -1.0 to 0.0 had a NPV of ≥94.5 % for DXA T-scores ≤ 2.5 and ≤ -2 at any site, confidently identifying patients least likely to have osteoporosis, thereby significantly reducing the number of patients requiring DXA screening for diagnosing osteoporosis by up to two-third. Osteoporosis screening is a significant unmet need in non-metastatic prostate cancer patients treated with ADT, and QUS may represent a valuable alternative pre-screening strategy to overcome logistics, time demands, and economic barriers encountered with current strategies for osteoporosis screening in these patients.  Summary:   Osteoporosis and associated increased fracture risk are common in non-metastatic prostate carcinoma, mainly due to androgen deprivation therapy, but these often remain underdiagnosed and untreated. We demonstrate that QUS is a safe, less costly pre-screen tool that reduces by up to two-third the number of patients requiring referral for DXA for osteoporosis screening.""","""['B B Nieuwkamer', 'J P M Vrouwe', 'P M Willemse', 'M P J Nicolai', 'R F M Bevers', 'R C M Pelger', 'N A T Hamdy', 'S Osanto']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Bone Rep""","""[]"""

Currently, most treatments for PCa involve Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) which inhibits androgen-dependent tumor cell growth. When PCa is diagnosed early and is still Androgen Dependent, ADT is effective. However, this therapy is not effective for metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). Although the mechanism of becoming Castration-Resistant is not fully understood, it is known that high levels of oxidative stress (OS) are important for cancer suppression. Catalase is a very important enzyme in controlling OS levels. We hypothesized that catalase function is critical for the progression to mCRPC. To test this hypothesis, we used a CRISPR nickase system to create a catalase knockdown in PC3 cells, a mCRPC human-derived cell line. We obtained a Cat+/- knockdown cell line, which has approximately half of the transcripts for catalase, half of the protein levels, and half of catalase activity. The Cat+/- cells are also about twice as sensitive to H2O2 exposure compared to WT cells, migrate poorly, have low attachment to collagen, high attachment to Matrigel, and proliferate slowly. Using SCID mice for a xenograft model, we show that Cat+/- cells form smaller tumors than wild-type tumors with less collagen and no blood vessels. These results were validated via rescue experiments where functional catalase was reintroduced into the Cat+/- cells and the phenotypes were reversed. This study shows a novel role for catalase in deterring mCRPC development and points to a new potential drug target for mCRPC progression. Summary: Novel treatments for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer are needed. By taking advantage of the sensitivity of tumor cells to oxidative stress (OS), reducing an enzyme, catalase, that decreases OS, has the potential to provide another target for Prostate Cancer therapy.""","""['Frantzeska Giginis', 'Joshua Wang', 'Aaron Chavez', 'Manuela Martins-Green']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Cancer Res""","""[]"""

Here, we aimed to broadly explore the associations of an obesity-related DP with overall and 19 site-specific cancers.  Methods:   This study included 114,289 cancer-free participants with at least two dietary assessments. A total of 210 food items were classified into 47 food groups, and the mean amount of each food group was used in reduced-rank regression to derive the obesity-related DP. Cox regressions were conducted to explore the associations of the obesity-related DP with overall and 19 site-specific cancers. The parallel mediation model was constructed to quantify the mediating roles of potential mediators.  Results:   During a median follow-up period of 9.4 years, 10,145 (8.9%) incident cancer cases were documented. The derived-DP was characterized by a higher intake of beer and cider, processed meat, high sugar beverages, red meat, and artificial sweetener, and a lower intake of fresh vegetables, olive oil, tea, and high fiber breakfast cereals. Observational analysis showed that a higher obesity-related DP Z-score was linearly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04 per 1-SD increase, corrected P < 0.001). For site-specific cancer, positive linear associations for six cancer sites (oral, colorectal, liver, lung, endometrium, and thyroid) and nonlinear associations for six cancer sites (esophagus, malignant melanoma, prostate, kidney, bladder, and multiple myeloma) were observed. The paralleled mediation analysis suggested that the association between the obesity-related DP and overall cancer is mediated by the body mass index (BMI), the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), C-reactive protein, high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), and triglycerides.  Conclusions:   The developed obesity-related DP is strongly associated with overall and multiple cancer sites. Our findings highlight the complicated and diverse associations between an obesity-related DP and cancers and provide clues for future research directions.""","""['Maiwulamujiang Maimaitiyiming', 'Hongxi Yang', 'Lihui Zhou', 'Xinyu Zhang', 'Qiliang Cai', 'Yaogang Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Med""","""[]"""

Materials:   The data of 229 patients with PCa from two centers were retrospectively analyzed and divided into training, internal validation, and external validation sets. Deep learning features were extracted and selected from each patient's prostate multiparametric MRI (diffusion-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging sequences) data to establish a deep radiomic signature and construct models for the preoperative prediction of Ki67 expression. Independent predictive risk factors were identified and incorporated into a clinical model, and the clinical and deep learning models were combined to obtain a joint model. The predictive performance of multiple deep-learning models was then evaluated.  Results:   Seven prediction models were constructed: one clinical model, three deep learning models (the DLRS-Resnet, DLRS-Inception, and DLRS-Densenet models), and three joint models (the Nomogram-Resnet, Nomogram-Inception, and Nomogram-Densenet models). The areas under the curve (AUCs) of the clinical model in the testing, internal validation, and external validation sets were 0.794, 0.711, and 0.75, respectively. The AUCs of the deep models and joint models ranged from 0.939 to 0.993. The DeLong test revealed that the predictive performance of the deep learning models and the joint models was superior to that of the clinical model (p < 0.01). The predictive performance of the DLRS-Resnet model was inferior to that of the Nomogram-Resnet model (p < 0.01), whereas the predictive performance of the remaining deep learning models and joint models did not differ significantly.

Methods:   A total of 43 consecutive scans were evaluated by two subspecialized radiologists who assigned scores using both the RI-QUAL and mPI-QUAL methods. The interreader agreement was analyzed using three statistical methods: concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Cohen's kappa. Time needed to arrive at a quality judgment was measured and compared using the Wilcoxon signed rank test.  Results:   The interreader agreement for RI-QUAL and mPI-QUAL scores was comparable, as evidenced by the high CCC (0.76 vs. 0.77, p = 0.93), ICC (0.86 vs. 0.87, p = 0.93), and moderate Cohen's kappa (0.61 vs. 0.64, p = 0.85) values. Moreover, RI-QUAL assessment was faster than mPI-QUAL (19 vs. 40 s, p = 0.001).  Conclusion:   RI-QUAL is a new quality score that has comparable interreader agreement to the mPI-QUAL score, but with the potential to be applied to different MRI protocols and even different modalities. Like PI-QUAL, RI-QUAL may also facilitate communication about quality to referring physicians, as it provides a standardized and easily interpretable score.

Most prostate malignancies are adenocarcinomas with luminal differentiation. However, some tumors undergo cellular reprogramming to a more lethal subset termed neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) with neuronal differentiation. The frequency of NEPC is increasing since the widespread use of potent androgen receptor signaling inhibitors. Currently, there are no effective treatments for NEPC. We previously determined that LSD1 promotes survival of prostate adenocarcinoma tumors. However, the role of LSD1 in NEPC is unknown. Here, we determined that LSD1 is highly upregulated in NEPC versus adenocarcinoma patient tumors. LSD1 suppression with RNAi or allosteric LSD1 inhibitors - but not catalytic inhibitors - reduced NEPC cell survival. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that LSD1 represses pathways linked to luminal differentiation, and TP53 was the top reactivated pathway. We confirmed that LSD1 suppressed the TP53 pathway by reducing TP53 occupancy at target genes while LSD1's catalytic function was dispensable for this effect. Mechanistically, LSD1 inhibition disrupted LSD1-HDAC interactions, increasing histone acetylation at TP53 targets. Finally, LSD1 inhibition suppressed NEPC tumor growth in vivo. These findings suggest that blocking LSD1's noncatalytic function may be a promising treatment strategy for NEPC.""","""['Anbarasu Kumaraswamy', 'Zhi Duan', 'Diana Flores', 'Chao Zhang', 'Archana Sehrawat', 'Ya-Mei Hu', 'Olivia A Swaim', 'Eva Rodansky', 'William K Storck', 'Joshua A Kuleape', 'Karan Bedi', 'Rahul Mannan', 'Xiao-Ming Wang', 'Aaron Udager', 'Visweswaran Ravikumar', 'Armand Bankhead rd', 'Ilsa Coleman', 'John K Lee', 'Colm Morrissey', 'Peter S Nelson', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan', 'Arvind Rao', 'Zheng Xia', 'Joel A Yates', 'Joshi J Alumkal']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCI Insight""","""[]"""

However, because PSA levels may be elevated for reasons other than PCa, it leads to high rates of misdiagnosis and overtreatment. Recently, alteration in the N-glycan sialylation of PSA, specifically increased levels of α2-3-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (α2-3-Neu5Ac or α2-3-sialic acid), was identified as a potential biomarker for clinically significant PCa. Here, we introduce a robust top-down native mass spectrometry (MS) approach, performed using a combination of α2-3-Neu5Ac-specific and nonspecific neuraminidases and employing center-of-mass monitoring (CoMMon), for quantifying the levels of α2-3-Neu5Ac as a fraction of total N-linked Neu5Ac present on PSA extracted from blood serum. To illustrate the potential of the assay for clinical diagnosis and disease staging of PCa, the percentages of α2-3-Neu5Ac on PSA (%α23PSA) in the serum of low-grade (International Society of Urological Pathology Grade Group/GG1), intermediate-grade (GG2), and high-grade (GG3,4,5) PCa individuals were measured. We observed a high sensitivity (85.5%) and specificity (84.6%) for discrimination of GG1 from clinically significant GG2-5 patients when using a %α23PSA test cut-off of 28.0%. Our results establish that the %α23PSA in blood serum PSA, which can be precisely measured in a non-invasive manner with our dual neuraminidase native MS/CoMMon assay, can discriminate between clinically significant PCa (GG2-5) and low-grade PCa (GG1). Such discrimination has not been previously achieved and represents an important clinical need. This assay could greatly improve the standard PSA test and serve as a valuable PCa diagnostic tool.""","""['Zhixiong Li', 'Duong T Bui', 'Yanxiang Shao', 'Elena N Kitova', 'Stephanie White', 'Danny Vesprini', 'Stanley K Liu', 'Lara K Mahal', 'Hon S Leong', 'John S Klassen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anal Chem""","""[]"""

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the intensity of ERG protein expression and the staging of prostate cancer and the formation of metastases in 635 samples. A retrospective cohort analysis was performed using immunohistochemistry reactions in tissue microarray samples taken from non-neoplastic and neoplastic prostate tissue from patients who underwent radical prostatectomies at a reference hospital from 2009 to 2016. For the ERG marker analysis, the samples were scored for the presence or absence of nuclear signals. Weak, moderate, or strong intensity of the nuclei of the observable tumor cells was considered to be positive markers. All told, 635 samples were evaluated, and the ERG expression was inconclusive in 9% of cases, while 30% were positive and 61% were negative. Of the samples with positive result: 25.8% were weak and focal, 53.2% were moderate, and 21% were strong. Finally, 21% of the cases with a positive ERG had a high Gleason score. Metastasis was detected in 41% of the patients who were ERG positive, and of these, the majority had moderate marking and were aged older than 60 years, although there was no statistically significant difference between the older and younger age groups. Patients with moderate to strong ERG staining had higher staging compared to the others, and no increase in metastasis was detected in patients with more intense ERG expression.

Based on functional subsets of peripheral lymphocyte with the largest sample size to date, this study aims to construct an easy-to-use and robust nomogram to guide the tripartite risk stratifications for PCa.  Methods:   We retrospectively collected data from 2039 PCa and benign prostate disease (BPD) patients with 42 clinical characteristics on functional subsets of peripheral lymphocyte. After quality control and feature selection, clinical data with the optimal feature subset were utilized for the 10-fold cross-validation of five Machine Learning (ML) models for the task of predicting low-, intermediate- and high-risk stratification of PCa. Then, a novel clinic-ML nomogram was constructed using probabilistic predictions of the trained ML models via the combination of a multivariable Ordinal Logistic Regression analysis and the proposed feature mapping algorithm.  Results:   197 PCa patients, including 56 BPD, were enrolled in the study. An optimal subset with nine clinical features was selected. Compared with the best ML model and the clinic nomogram, the clinic-ML nomogram achieved the superior performance with a sensitivity of 0.713 (95% CI 0.573-0.853), specificity of 0.869 (95% CI 0.764-0.974), F1 of 0.699 (95% CI 0.557-0.841), and AUC of 0.864 (95% CI 0.794-0.935).

Automatic deformable image registration (DIR) is a critical step in adaptive radiotherapy. Manually delineated organs-at-risk (OARs) contours on planning CT (pCT) scans are deformably registered onto daily cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans for delivered dose accumulation. However, evaluation of registered contours requires human assessment, which is time-consuming and subjects to high inter-observer variability. This work proposes a deep learning model that allows accurate prediction of Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) of registered contours in prostate radiotherapy.Approach. Our dataset comprises 20 prostate cancer patients with 37-39 daily CBCT scans each. The pCT scans and planning contours were deformably registered to each corresponding CBCT scan to generate virtual CT (vCT) scans and registered contours. The DSC score, which is a common contour-based validation metric for registration quality, between the registered and manual contours were computed. A Siamese neural network was trained on the vCT-CBCT image pairs to predict DSC. To assess the performance of the model, the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the actual and predicted DSC were computed.Main results. The model showed promising results for predicting DSC, giving RMSE of 0.070, 0.079 and 0.118 for rectum, prostate, and bladder respectively on the holdout test set. Clinically, a low RMSE implies that the predicted DSC can be reliably used to determine if further DIR assessment from physicians is required. Considering the event where a registered contour is classified as poor if its DSC is below 0.6 and good otherwise, the model achieves an accuracy of 92% for the rectum. A sensitivity of 0.97 suggests that the model can correctly identify 97% of poorly registered contours, allowing manual assessment of DIR to be triggered.Significance.

Statistical analysis was conducted from November 2022 to January 2023.  Main outcomes and measures:   Survival time ratios (TRs) were calculated using accelerated failure time models, and the primary outcome of interest examined was death from index cancer vs alternative (nonindex cancer) mortality across breast, prostate, colon, and rectal cancer cohorts. Secondary outcomes included subgroup mortality in cancer-specific risk groups, categorized based on prognostic factors, and proportion of deaths due to cancer-specific vs noncancer-specific causes. Independent variables included age, sex, race and ethnicity, income, residence, stage, grade, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status, prostate-specific antigen level, and Gleason score.

Conclusion:   There is a trend of reversal of inequalities between incidence-mortality and incidence-survival, and the most social vulnerable segment presents lower survival rates for the types of cancer, pointing to the existence of inequality in access to early diagnosis and effective and timely treatment.""","""['Maria do Carmo Ferreira', 'Ivan Arroyave', 'Marilisa Berti de Azevedo Barros']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Rev Saude Publica""","""[]"""

The distinctive tropism of malaria infected erythrocytes and the identification of oncofetal CS, therefore, represent potentially potent tools for cancer targeting. Here we describe an intriguing drug delivery platform that effectively mimics infected erythrocytes and their specificity for ofCS. We used a lipid catcher-tag conjugation system for the functionalization of erythrocyte membrane-coated drug carriers with recombinant VAR2CSA (rVAR2). We show that these malaria mimicking erythrocyte nanoparticles (MMENPs) loaded with docetaxel (DTX) specifically target and kill melanoma cells in vitro. We further demonstrate effective targeting and therapeutic efficacy in a xenografted melanoma model. These data thus provide a proof of concept for the use of a malaria biomimetic for tumor targeted drug delivery. Given the broad presentation of ofCS found across various types of malignancies, this biomimetic may therefore show potential as a broadly targeted cancer therapy against multiple tumor indications.""","""['Jessica Pihl', 'Thomas M Clausen', 'Jiarong Zhou', 'Nishta Krishnan', 'Maj S Ørum-Madsen', 'Tobias Gustavsson', 'Robert Dagil', 'Mads Daugaard', 'Swati Choudhary', 'Camilla Foged', 'Jeffrey D Esko', 'Liangfang Zhang', 'Ronnie H Fang', 'Ali Salanti']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""ACS Nano""","""[]"""

Compound 3i was found to be the most effective VEGFR-2 inhibitor using in vitro testing of the synthesized compounds, with nearly 3-fold higher activity than Sorafenib (30 nM), with IC50 8.93 nM. Compound 3i significantly stimulated total apoptotic prostate cancer cell death 55.2-fold (34.26% compared to 0.62% for the control) arresting the cell cycle at the S-phase. The genes involved in apoptosis were also impacted, with proapoptotic genes being upregulated and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 being downregulated. These results were supported by docking studies of these two compounds within the active site of the VEGFR2 enzyme. Finally, in vivo, the study revealed the potentiality of compound 3i to inhibit tumor proliferation by 49.8% reducing the tumor weight from 234.6 mg in untreated mice to 83.2 mg.

The initial host-tumor interaction as assessed by detailed analysis of tumor infiltrating immune cells within the primary tumor may dictate tumor evolution and late clinical outcomes. In this study, we assessed the association between clinical outcomes and dendritic cell (DC) or macrophage (MΦ) tumor infiltration as well as with expression of genes related to their functions.  Methods:   Infiltration and localization of immature DC, mature DC, total MΦ and M2-type MΦ was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 99 radical prostatectomy specimens from patients with 15.5 years median clinical follow-up using antibodies against CD209, CD83, CD68 and CD163, respectively. The density of positive cells for each marker in various tumor areas was determined. In addition, expression of immune genes associated with DC and MΦ was tested in a series of 50 radical prostatectomy specimens by Taqman Low-Density Array with similarly long follow-up. Gene expression was classified as low and high after unsupervised hierarchical clustering. Numbers and ratio of positive cells and levels of gene expression were correlated with endpoints such as biochemical recurrence (BCR), need for definitive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) or lethal PCa using Cox regression analyses and/or Kaplan-Meier curves.  Results:   Positive immune cells were observed in tumor, tumor margin, and normal-like adjacent epithelium areas. CD209+ and CD163+ cells were more abundant at the tumor margin. Higher CD209+/CD83+ cell density ratio at the tumor margin was associated with higher risk of ADT and lethal PCa while higher density of CD163+ cells in the normal-like adjacent epithelium was associated with a higher risk of lethal PCa. A combination of 5 genes expressed at high levels correlated with a shorter survival without ADT and lethal PCa. Among these five genes, expression of IL12A and CD163 was correlated to each other and was associated with shorter survival without BCR and ADT/lethal PCa, respectively.  Conclusion:   A higher level of infiltration of CD209+ immature DC and CD163+ M2-type MΦ in the peritumor area was associated with late adverse clinical outcomes.""","""['Oscar Eduardo Molina', 'Hélène LaRue', 'David Simonyan', 'Hélène Hovington', 'Bernard Têtu', 'Vincent Fradet', 'Louis Lacombe', 'Paul Toren', 'Alain Bergeron', 'Yves Fradet']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""[]"""

Tumour marker tests are more expensive than routine chemistry testing. Implementing test demand management systems like electronic gatekeeping (EGK) has reportedly decreased test requests.  Objective:   This study aimed to describe the appropriateness of tumour marker tests, carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha foetal protein, prostate-specific antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, cancer antigen 15-3, cancer antigen 125, and human chorionic gonadotropin, and determine the effectiveness of the EGK used in the public health sector in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.  Methods:   Tumour marker test data for the KwaZulu-Natal province were extracted from the National Health Laboratory Service Central Data Warehouse for 01 January 2017 - 30 June 2017 (pre-EGK) and 01 January 2018 - 30 June 2018 (post-EGK implementation). Questionnaires were sent to the clinicians in the regional hospitals ordering the most tumour marker tests to assess ordering practices. In addition, we assessed monthly rejection reports to determine the effect of the EGK.  Results:   The EGK minimally reduced tumour marker requests or associated costs (1.4% average EGK rejection rate). An overall 18% increase in the tumour marker tests occurred in 2018. The data suggest inappropriate tumour marker test utilisation, particularly for screening.  Conclusion:   The introduction of EGK as a test demand management had little impact on tumour marker test requests and costs. Continuous education and reiteration of indications for tumour marker test use are required.  What this study adds:   This study demonstrates the ineffectiveness of EGK in tumour marker orders, and provides some insight as to why these markers are being ordered, which is important in trying to decrease inappropriate ordering of these tests.""","""['Immaculate S Dlamini', 'Verena Gounden', 'Nareshni Moodley']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Afr J Lab Med""","""[]"""

Identification of new molecular markers that predict the onset and progression of the disease could improve its clinical management. Low miR-145-5p expression is consistently found in primary tumors and metastases, but the regulatory mechanisms governing its functions remain largely unknown.  Methods:   Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify [1] a set of novel potential competing endogenous lncRNAs for sponging of miRNA-145-5p in prostate cancer and [2] miR-145-5p and other EMT-related miRNAs response elements in lnc-ZNF30-3. Quantification of miR-145-5p, lnc-ZNF30-3, and TWIST1 expression levels in tumor tissues in RNA sequencing datasets of our and TCGA PRAD cohorts revealed a correlation with clinical outcome of prostate cancer patients. Biochemical and cell biology approaches, such as RNA pull-down, western blot, immunostaining, and wound healing assays were used for evaluation of the impact of TWIST1/miR-145/ lnc-ZNF30-3 interactions in prostate cancer cells altered in miRNA and lncRNA expression.  Results:   We identified a few potential lncRNA sponges of miR-145-5p, including lnc-ZNF30-3. It contains five response elements for miR-145-5p, but also other miRNAs targeting EMT transcription factors. Lnc-ZNF30-3 is significantly upregulated in prostate cancer cell lines and tumor tissues, and its high expression is correlated with poor patient prognosis. We demonstrated that lnc-ZNF30-3 is associated with AGO2 and specifically interacts with the miR-145-5p seed region. Knockdown of lnc-ZNF30-3 results in decreased migration of prostate cancer cells and downregulation of EMT drivers such as TWIST1 and ZEB1 at both the RNA and protein levels. These phenotypic and molecular features of lnc-ZNF30-3-depleted cells are partially rescued by miR-145-5p inhibition.  Conclusions:   Collectively, our results point to lnc-ZNF30-3 as a novel competing endogenous lncRNA for miR-145-5p and other miRNAs that target TWIST1 as well as other EMT transcription factors. Prostate cancer patients with high lncRNA expression in primary tumors show lower survival rate suggesting that lnc-ZNF30-3 may contribute to prostate cancer progression and metastasis.""","""['Matthieu Le Hars#', 'Luis Jaime Castro-Vega#', 'Fatemeh Rajabi', 'David Tabatadze', 'Martha Romero', 'Marina Pinskaya', 'Irina Groisman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Biol Direct""","""[]"""

Understanding racial disparities in survival is critical for accurate prognostic risk stratification and for informing the design of multiregional clinical trials.  Methods:   This multiple-cohort study included individual patient-level data for males with de novo metastatic PCa from the following 3 cohorts: LATITUDE clinical trial data (n=1,199), the SEER program (n=15,476), and the National Cancer Database (NCDB; n=10,366). Primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) in LATITUDE and NCDB and OS and cancer-specific survival in SEER.  Results:   Across all 3 cohorts, Asian patients diagnosed with de novo metastatic PCa had better survival than white patients. In LATITUDE, median OS was significantly longer in Asian versus white patients in the androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) + abiraterone + prednisone group (not reached vs 43.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI, 0.28-0.73; P=.001) as well as in the ADT + placebo group (57.6 vs 32.7 months; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33-0.78; P=.002).

The most common cancers are breast, lung, colon and rectum and prostate cancers. Of these, lung cancer, accounted for about 1.8 million of all cancer deaths (25%) in 2020. Detection of cancer relies on presence of biomarkers such as DNA molecules, proteins and metabolites released by cancerous cells into the circulation. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is one of the biomarkers that has been used for the detection of lung cancer. However, CEA is not specific to lung cancer since it is also manifested in gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. Recently, v-YES1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (YES1) was described as a specific biomarker for lung cancer. The detection of both CEA and YES1 would give more precise and authentic information for detecting lung cancer. This is because detection of a single tumor marker usually limits the precision in tumor diagnosis, due to the fact that several cancers have more than one marker linked with their prevalence. Whereas traditional methods have been used for the detection of CEA, electrochemical immunosensors have attracted considerable attention owing to their profound advantages, including fast response, miniaturization, high selectivity, low sample requirements and magnificent sensitivity. The fabrication of a multiplex and simultaneous immunosensor is met with challenge of preparation of distinguishable immunoprobes with different redox activities. This can be addressed by incorporation of electroactive Nano metals into the sensing platform. In this study, gold nanoparticles were used for the fabrication of an ultrasensitive sandwich electrochemical multiplex immunosensor for simultaneous detection of CEA and YES1. Under optimized conditions, the electrochemical immunosensor detection limit for YES1 and CEA was found to be 0.0022 and 0.0034 ng/mL respectively within a linear range of 0.1-50 ng/mL. The proposed immunosensor proved to be stable for up to 2 weeks and had negligible cross reactivity towards various interfering compounds in human plasma. This study reports that gold nanoparticles can be bio synthesized using shade dried Mangifera indica leaves extract. The bio-synthesized gold nanoparticles coupled with thiolated protein G can be used for fabrication of a multiplex immunosensor for detection of CEA and YES1. The proposed immunosensor can provide a new approach for early diagnosis of circulating cancer biomarkers and holds great promise for application in clinical diagnosis.""","""['Lucia K Kiio', 'John O Onyatta', 'Peter M Ndangili', 'Florence Oloo', 'Carolina Santamaria', 'Luis M Montuenga', 'Damaris N Mbui']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Talanta""","""[]"""

Recently, studies on the role of natural-origin active substances in the prevention of cancer development gained importance. Among them, the α-lipoic acid, which is commonly found in plants, displayed potent anti-proliferative effects on cancer cell lines. However, the effect of the compound on the induction of apoptosis and mRNA expression of MMPs in human prostate cancer cells remains unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-proliferative and apoptotic activity of α-lipoic acid in human PC3 prostate carcinoma cells considering different concentrations and exposure durations. The findings showed that, α-lipoic acid significantly decreased PC3 cell viability with an IC50 value of 1.71 mM at 48 h (p < 0.05). Additionally, the compound significantly increased Annexin-V binding in cells compared to control and induced a significant alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential and caspase levels (p < 0.05). Furhermore, the RT-PCR analyses have revealed that α-lipoic acid reduced MMP-9 mRNA expression in PC3 cells compared to the control (p < 0.05).

The enrolled patients were randomly assigned to the training groups (n = 384, 70%) and validation groups (n = 164, 30%). To identify independent variables for PCa, serum lipids (TC, TG, HDL, LDL, apoA-1, and apoB) were taken into account in the multivariable logistic regression analyses of the training group, and established predictive models. After that, we evaluated prediction models with clinical markers using decision curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Based on training group data, a Nomogram was developed to predict PCa.  Results:   210 (54.70%) of the patients in the training group were diagnosed with PCa. Multivariate regression analysis showed that total PSA, f/tPSA, PSA density (PSAD), TG, LDL, DRE, and TRUS were independent risk predictors of PCa. A prediction model utilizing a Nomogram was constructed with a cut-off value of 0.502. The training and validation groups achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.846 and 0.814 respectively. According to the decision curve analysis (DCA), the prediction model yielded optimal overall net benefits in both the training and validation groups, which is better than the optimal net benefit of PSA alone. After comparing our developed prediction model with two domestic models and PCPT-RC, we found that our prediction model exhibited significantly superior predictive performance. Furthermore, in comparison with clinical indicators, our Nomogram's ability to predict prostate cancer showed good estimation, suggesting its potential as a reliable tool for prognostication.

However, typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis often involves post hoc manual curation to ensure clusters are transcriptionally distinct, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and irreproducible.  Results:   To overcome these obstacles, we developed Cytocipher, a bioinformatics method and scverse compatible software package that statistically determines significant clusters. Application of Cytocipher to normal tissue, development, disease, and large-scale atlas data reveals the broad applicability and power of Cytocipher to generate biological insights in numerous contexts. This included the identification of cell types not previously described in the datasets analysed, such as CD8+ T cell subtypes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells; cell lineage intermediate states during mouse pancreas development; and subpopulations of luminal epithelial cells over-represented in prostate cancer. Cytocipher also scales to large datasets with high-test performance, as shown by application to the Tabula Sapiens Atlas representing >480 000 cells. Cytocipher is a novel and generalizable method that statistically determines transcriptionally distinct and programmatically reproducible clusters from single-cell data.

Previous studies have demonstrated that lycopene can inhibit proliferation, while curcumin can strongly inhibit inflammation. This study aims to determine the inhibitory effect of the combination of lycopene and curcumin on BPH.  Method:   To induce BPH models in vitro and in vivo, the BPH-1 cell line and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were used, respectively. Rats were divided into six groups and treated daily with a vehicle, lycopene (12.5 mg/kg), curcumin (2.4 mg/kg), a combination of lycopene and curcumin (12.5 mg/kg + 2.4 mg/kg) or finasteride (5 mg/kg). Histologic sections were examined via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemistry. Hormone and inflammatory indicators were detected via ELISA. Network pharmacology analysis was used to fully predict the therapeutic mechanism of the combination of lycopene and curcumin on BPH.  Results:   Combination treatment significantly attenuated prostate hyperplasia, alleviated BPH pathological features and decreased the expression of Ki-67 in rats. The upregulation of the expression of testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 5α-reductase, estradiol (E2) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in BPH rats was significantly blocked by the combination treatment. The expression levels of inflammatory factors including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α were strongly inhibited by the combination treatment. From the network pharmacology analysis, it was found that the main targets for inhibiting BPH are AKT1, TNF, EGFR, STAT3 and PTGS2, which are enriched in pathways in cancer.

However, the therapeutic use of 2ME has been hampered due to its low solubility and bioavailability. Thus, it is necessary to find new ways of administration for 2ME. Zeolites are inorganic aluminosilicates with a porous structure and are considered good adsorbents and sieves in the pharmaceutical field. Here, mordenite-type zeolite nanoparticles were loaded with 2ME to assess its efficiency as a delivery system for prostate cancer treatment. The 2ME-loaded zeolite nanoparticles showed an irregular morphology with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 250.9 ± 11.4 nm, polydispersity index of 0.36 ± 0.04, and a net negative surface charge of -34 ± 1.73 meV. Spectroscopy with UV-vis and Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Fourier-Transform was used to elucidate the interaction between the 2ME molecules and the zeolite framework showing the formation of a 2ME-zeolite conjugate in the nanocomposite. The studies of adsorption and liberation determined that zeolite nanoparticles incorporated 40% of 2ME while the liberation of 2ME reached 90% at pH 7.4 after 7 days. The 2ME-loaded zeolite nanoparticles also decreased the viability and increased the mRNA of the 2ME-target gene F-spondin, encoded by SPON1, in the human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Finally, the 2ME-loaded nanoparticles also decreased the viability of primary cultures from mouse prostate cancer.

Agricultural-waste-derived extracts have drawn the attention of researchers as they represent a valid and sustainable way to exploit waste production. Indeed, such extracts are rich in bioactive compounds and can provide health-promoting effects. In particular, extracts obtained from pomegranate wastes and by-products have been shown to exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. This study focused on the evaluation of the anti-angiogenic effects and chemopreventive action of a pomegranate extract (PWE) in cellular models of BPH. In our experimental conditions, we observed that PWE was able to significantly (p < 0.001) reduce the proliferation and migration rates (up to 60%), together with the clonogenic capacity of BPH-1 cells concomitantly with the reduction in inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, PGE2) and pro-angiogenic factor (VEGF-ADMA) release. Additionally, we demonstrated the ability of PWE in reducing angiogenesis in an in vitro model of BPH consisting in transferring BPH-1-cell-conditioned media to human endothelial H5V cells. Indeed, PWE was able to reduce tube formation in H5V cells through VEGF level reduction even at low concentrations.

Treatment varies from active surveillance or watchful waiting to prostatectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy in combination or alone. Although radical prostate cancer therapy reduces the advancement of the disease and its mortality, the increased disease treatment associated morbidity, erectile dysfunction, and incontinence affect the quality of life of cancer survivors. To overcome these problems, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has previously been investigated using PhotofrinTM as a photosensitizer (PS). However, Photofrin-PDT has shown limitations in treating prostate cancer due to its limited tumor-specificity and the depth of light penetration at 630 nm (the longest wavelength absorption of PhotofrinTM). The results presented herein show that this limitation can be solved by using a near infrared (NIR) compound as a photosensitizer (PS) for PDT and the same agent also acts as a sonosensitizer for SDT (using ultrasound to activate the compound). Compared to light, ultrasound has a stronger penetration ability in biological tissues. Exposing the PS (or sonosensitizer) to ultrasound (US) initiates an electron-transfer process with a biological substrate to form radicals and radical ions (type I reaction). In contrast, exposure of the PS to light (PDT) generates singlet oxygen (type II reaction). Therefore, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by SDT and PDT follow two distinct pathways, i.e., type I (oxygen independent) and type II (oxygen dependent), respectively, and results in significantly enhanced destruction of tumor cells. The preliminary in vitro and in vivo results in a PC3 cell line and tumor model indicate that the tumor specificality of the therapeutic agent(s) can be increased by targeting galectin-1 and galectin-3, known for their overexpression in prostate cancer.""","""['Joseph Cacaccio', 'Farukh A Durrani', 'Ishaan Kumar', 'Mykhaylo Dukh', 'Susan Camacho', 'Zahra Fayazi', 'Adam Sumlin', 'Eric Kauffman', 'Khurshid Guru', 'Ravindra K Pandey']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Mol Sci""","""[]"""

Crataeva tapia bark lectin, CrataBL, targets sulfated oligosaccharides in glycosylated proteins and has also demonstrated deleterious effects on prostate and glioblastoma tumor cells.

While endocrine therapy is highly effective for this subpopulation, endocrine resistance remains a major challenge and the identification of novel targets is urgently needed. Previously, we have shown that Semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C) is an autocrine growth factor that drives the growth and treatment resistance of various cancers, but its role in breast cancer progression and endocrine resistance is poorly understood. Here, we report that SEMA3C plays a role in maintaining the growth of ER+ BCa cells and is a novel, tractable therapeutic target for the treatment of ER+ BCa patients. Analyses of publicly available clinical datasets indicate that ER+ BCa patients express significantly higher levels of SEMA3C mRNA than other subtypes. Furthermore, SEMA3C mRNA expression was positively correlated with ESR1 mRNA expression. ER+ BCa cell lines (MCF7 and T47D) expressed higher levels of SEMA3C mRNA and protein than a normal mammary epithelial MCF10A cell line. ER siRNA knockdown was suppressed, while dose-dependent beta-estradiol treatment induced SEMA3C expression in both MCF7 and T47D cells, suggesting that SEMA3C is an ER-regulated gene. The stimulation of ER+ BCa cells with recombinant SEMA3C activated MAPK and AKT signaling in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, SEMA3C silencing inhibited Estrogen Receptor (ER) expression, MAPK and AKT signaling pathways while simultaneously inducing apoptosis, as monitored by flow cytometry and Western blot analyses. SEMA3C silencing significantly inhibited the growth of ER+ BCa cells, implicating a growth dependency of ER+ BCa cells on SEMA3C. Moreover, the analysis of tamoxifen resistant (TamR) cell models (TamC3 and TamR3) showed that SEMA3C levels remain high despite treatment with tamoxifen. Tamoxifen-resistant cells remained dependent on SEMA3C for growth and survival. Treatment with B1SP Fc fusion protein, a SEMA3C pathway inhibitor, attenuated SEMA3C-induced signaling and growth across a panel of tamoxifen sensitive and resistant ER+ breast cancer cells. Furthermore, SEMA3C silencing and B1SP treatment were associated with decreased EGFR signaling in TamR cells. Here, our study implicates SEMA3C in a functional role in ER+ breast cancer signaling and growth that suggests ER+ BCa patients may benefit from SEMA3C-targeted therapy.""","""['Satyam Bhasin', 'Christopher Dusek', 'James W Peacock', 'Artem Cherkasov', 'Yuzhuo Wang', 'Martin Gleave', 'Christopher J Ong']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cells""","""[]"""

However, their aberrant expression levels, prognostic values and specific roles in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) remain largely unclear.  Methods:   Two independent public datasets (TCGA-PRAD and GSE21032), containing 648 PCa samples in total, were employed to comprehensively examine the mRNA expression changes of ST6GALNAC family members in PCa, as well as their associations with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. The dysregulation of ST6GALNAC5 was further validated in a mouse PCa model and human PCa samples from our cohort (n = 64) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes and drug sensitivity analyses were performed to enrich the biological processes most related to ST6GALNAC5. Sulforhodamine B, transwell, luciferase reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were used to examine the PCa cell proliferation, invasion and transcriptional regulation, respectively.  Results:   Systematical investigation of six ST6GALNAC family members in public datasets revealed that ST6GALNAC5 was the only gene consistently and significantly upregulated in metastatic PCa, and ST6GALNAC5 overexpression was also positively associated with Gleason score and predicted poor prognosis in PCa patients. IHC results showed that (1) ST6GALNAC5 protein expression was increased in prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and further elevated in PCa from a PbCre;PtenF/F mouse model; (2) overexpressed ST6GALNAC5 protein was confirmed in human PCa samples comparing with benign prostatic hyperplasia samples from our cohort (p < 0.001); (3) ST6GALNAC5 overexpression was significantly correlated with perineural invasion of PCa. Moreover, we first found transcription factor GATA2 positively and directly regulated ST6GALNAC5 expression at transcriptional level. ST6GALNAC5 overexpression could partially reverse GATA2-depletion-induced inhibition of PCa cell invasion. The GATA2-ST6GALNAC5 signature exhibited better prediction on the poor prognosis in PCa patients than GATA2 or ST6GALNAC5 alone.

Microphysiological systems (MPS) can replicate cancer microenvironments and lead to cellular phenotypic changes that better represent organ physiology in vitro. In this study, we developed an MPS model comprising conventional prostate cancer cells to evaluate their activity under dynamic culture conditions. Androgen-sensitive (LNCaP) and androgen-insensitive (PC3) cells were grown in conventional and 3D cultures, both static and dynamic. Cell morphology, the secretion of prostate-specific antigen, and the expression of key prostate markers and microRNAs were analyzed. LNCaP formed spheroids in 3D and MPS cultures, with morphological changes supported by the upregulation of cytokeratins and adhesion proteins. LNCaP also maintained a constant prostate-specific antigen secretion in MPS. PC3 cells did not develop complex structures in 3D and MPS cultures. PSA expression at the gene level was downregulated in LNCaP-MPS and considerably upregulated in PC3-MPS. MicroRNA expression was altered by the 3D static and dynamic culture, both intra- and extracellularly. MicroRNAs associated with prostate cancer progression were mostly upregulated in LNCaP-MPS. Overall dynamic cell culture substantially altered the morphology and expression of LNCaP cells, arguably augmenting their prostate cancer phenotype.

Materials and methods:   Patients with histologically confirmed advanced GU malignancies were prospectively enrolled. All eligible patients received ICI treatment for at least 12 weeks, followed by serial collection of blood samples every 6-8 weeks and conventional scans approximately every 12 weeks until disease progression. ctDNA analysis was performed using Signatera, a tumor-informed multiplex-polymerase chain reaction next-generation sequencing assay. Overall, the objective response rate (ORR) was reported and its association with ctDNA status was evaluated. Concordance rate between ctDNA dynamics and conventional imaging was also assessed.  Results:   ctDNA analysis was performed on 98 banked plasma samples from 20 patients (15 renal, four urothelial, and one prostate). The median follow-up from the time of initiation of ICI to progressive disease (PD) or data cutoff was 67.7 weeks (range, 19.6-169.6). The ORR was 70% (14/20). Eight patients ultimately developed PD.

Across racial groups, the internet is a popular source of health information; Black adults are more likely to trust online health information, yet have more medical mistrust than White adults.  Objective:   To evaluate the association between racial representation in online content about prostate cancer and trust in the content and identify factors that influence trust.  Design, setting, and participants:   A randomized clinical trial was conducted from August 18, 2021, to January 7, 2022, consisting of a 1-time online survey. Participants included US men and women aged 40 years and older. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to June 2023.  Interventions:   Participants were randomized to watch the same video script about either prostate cancer screening or clinical trials presented by 1 of 4 speakers: a Black physician, a Black patient, a White physician, or a White patient, followed by a questionnaire.  Main outcomes and measures:   The primary outcome was a published scale for trust in the information. χ2 tests and multivariable logistic regression were used to compare trust according to the video's speaker and topic.  Results:   Among 2904 participants, 1801 (62%) were men, and the median (IQR) age was 59 (47-69) years. Among 1703 Black adults, a greater proportion had high trust in videos with Black speakers vs White speakers (72.7% vs 64.3%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.28-2.05; P < .001); less trust with patient vs physician presenter (64.6% vs 72.5%; aOR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.80; P < .001) and about clinical trials vs screening (66.3% vs 70.7%; aOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.99; P = .04). Among White adults, a lower proportion had high trust in videos featuring a patient vs physician (72.0% vs 78.6%; aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95; P = .02) and clinical trials vs screening (71.4% vs 79.1%; aOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.42-0.76; P < .001), but no difference for Black vs White presenters (76.8% vs 73.7%; aOR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.83-1.48; P = .49).  Conclusions and relevance:   In this randomized clinical trial, prostate cancer information was considered more trustworthy when delivered by a physician, but racial concordance was significantly associated with trust only among Black adults. These results highlight the importance of physician participation and increasing racial diversity in public dissemination of health information and an ongoing need for public education about clinical trials.

Despite the recent therapeutic advances, such as immunotherapies, survival of patients with advance disease remains significantly low. Blockade of immune checkpoints has led to low response rates in these patients probably due to the immunosuppressive microenvironment and low mutation burden of prostate tumors. Combination of multiple immunotherapeutic regimes has also been unsatisfactory due to augmented adverse effects. To activate multiple immune-stimulatory pathways in the hostile prostate cancer microenvironment, we used a combination of cytotopically modified interleukin-15 (cyto-IL-15) with the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, ADU-S100.  Methods:   To determine whether this combination regime could lead to both local and systemic anti-tumor effects, intratumoral administration of these agents was used in murine models of prostate cancer. Tumor growth and mouse survival were monitored, and ex vivo analyses, and RNA sequencing were performed on the tumors.  Results:   Intratumorally injected ADU-S100 and cyto-IL-15 synergized to eliminate tumors in 58-67% of mice with unilateral tumors and promoted abscopal immunity in 50% of mice with bilateral tumors treated only at one side. Moreover, this combination regime offered immunoprotection against tumor rechallenge in 83% of cured mice. The efficacy of the combination treatment was associated with a strong innate and adaptive immune activation and induction of apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Cytokines, including type I and II interferons, and cytokine signalling pathways were activated, NK and T cell mediated cytotoxicity was increased, and B cells were activated both locally and systemically. While ADU-S100 led to an ulcerative pathology at the injection site, no other adverse effects were observed.  Discussion:   Localised administration of a STING agonist together with cyto-IL-15 can confer significant systemic benefits and long-lasting immunity against prostate tumors while reducing immune related toxicities.""","""['Efthymia Papaevangelou', 'Ana M Esteves', 'Prokar Dasgupta', 'Christine Galustian']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Front Immunol""","""[]"""

This method is based on enhancing the intensity of luminescence displayed by the optical sensor N/S-doped carbon dots (CQDs) upon adding different concentrations of β-hCG. The luminescent optical sensor was synthesized and characterized through absorption and emission and is tailored to present blue luminescence at λem = 345 nm and λex = 288 nm at pH 7.8 in DMSO. The enhancement of the luminescence intensity of the N/S-doped CQDs, especially, the characteristic band at λem = 345 nm, is typically used for determining β-hCG in different serum samples. The dynamic range is 1.35-22.95 mU mL-1, and the limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation limit of detection (LOQ) are 0.235 and 0.670 mU mL-1, respectively.

Methods:   Data from 1,112 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2011 and 2020 were collected using medical records, and ""pc-follow"" systems were used to collect patients' baseline information, education level, pathological information, number of outpatient visits, the time interval between each visit, and PSA test data.  Results:   Regarding postoperative outpatient data, there was no difference in the number of outpatient visits among the different education level groups in Shanghai (P = 0.063). A significant difference was found in the interval between outpatient visits among the groups (P < 0.001). Furthermore, significant differences were detected in the number and duration of outpatient clinic visits among the education level groups in all patients (P = 0.016, P = 0.0027). By contrast, no significant difference was found in the recovery time of urinary continence between all patients and those in Shanghai, grouped according to education level (P = 0.082, P = 0.68).

Many mechanisms which influence proliferation and quiescence choices remain to be elucidated, including the role of non-coding RNAs. In this study, we investigated the role of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), SNHG1, on cell proliferation, quiescence, and sensitivity to docetaxel as a potential factor important in prostate cancer biology.  Methods:   Publically available, anonymous, clinical data was obtained from cBioPortal for analysis. RNAi and prostate cancer cell lines were utilized to investigate SNHG1 in vitro. We measured G0 cells, DNA synthesis, and cell cycle distribution by flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to assess G2 arrest and apoptosis. These parameters were also investigated following docetaxel treatment.  Results:   We discovered that in prostate cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data set, high SNHG1 expression in localized tumors correlated with reduced progression-free survival, and in a data set of both primary and metastatic tumors, high SNHG1 expression was associated with metastatic tumors. In vitro analysis of prostate cancer cell lines showed SNHG1 expression correlated with a quiescent versus proliferative phenotype. Knockdown of SNHG1 by RNAi in PC3 and C4-2B cells resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G0 phase. After knockdown, 60.0% of PC3 cells were in G0, while control cultures had 13.2% G0. There were reciprocal decreases in G1 phase, but little impact on the proportion of cells in S and G2/M phases, depending on cell line. DNA synthesis and proliferation were largely halted- decreasing by 75% and 81% in C4-2B and PC3 cells, respectively. When cells were treated with docetaxel, SNHG1-depleted C4-2B and PC3 cells were resistant to G2 arrest, and displayed reduced apoptosis, as indicated by reduced cyclin B1 and cleaved caspase 3, suggesting SNHG1 levels may modulate drug response.  Conclusions:   Overall, these results indicate SNHG1 has complex roles in prostate cancer, as it stimulates cell cycle entry and disease progression, but sensitizes cells to docetaxel treatment.""","""['Steven P Zielske', 'Wei Chen', 'Kristina G Ibrahim', 'Frank C Cackowski']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""[]"""

Using the human prostate cancer cell line C4-2, which can proliferate in hormone-dependent and hormone-independent conditions, we found that epidermal growth factor (EGF)-activated EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling via 3-O-sulfated heparan sulfate (HS) produced by HS 3-O-sulfotransferase 1 (HS3ST1) is activated in C4-2 cells under hormone depletion. Knockdown of HS3ST1 in C4-2 cells suppressed hormone-independent growth, and inhibited both EGF binding to the cell surface and activation of EGFR-ERK1/2 signaling. Gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, significantly suppressed C4-2 cell proliferation and growth of a xenografted C4-2 tumor in castrated mouse.

Semen components, like vitamin C, can modulate sperm function. Vitamin C is an effective scavenger of free radicals and is an essential component of enzymes such as TET proteins involved in the DNA demethylation process. In the present study, a broad range of parameters which may influence the metabolic state of the prostate gland were analysed including blood and prostate tissue vitamin C, epigenetic DNA modifications and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine in DNA of leukocytes and prostate tissues.  Methods:   The experimental material were tissue samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), normal/marginal prostate tissues from prostate cancer patients, leukocytes from healthy donors, and blood plasma from BPH patients and healthy donors. We applied ultra-performance liquid chromatography methods with mass spectrometry and/or UV detection.  Results:   We found an unprecedentedly high level of intracellular vitamin C in all analysed prostatic tissues (benign prostatic hyperplasia and normal, marginal ones), a value much higher than in leukocytes and most human tissues. DNA epigenetic patterns in prostate cells are similar to other soft tissues like the colon, however, its uniqueness is the unprecedentedly high level of 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine and a significant increase in 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine value compared to aforementioned tissues. Moreover, the level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, an established marker of oxidative stress, is significantly higher in prostate tissues than in leukocytes and many previously studied soft tissues.

We previously reported that loss of PTEN function in prostate cancer leads to increased expression and secretion of the Prorenin Receptor (PRR) and its soluble processed form, the soluble Prorenin Receptor (sPRR). PRR is an essential factor required for proper assembly and activity of the vacuolar-ATPase (V-ATPase). The V-ATPase is a rotary proton pump required for the acidification of intracellular vesicles including endosomes and lysosomes. Acidic vesicles are involved in a wide range of cancer related pathways such as receptor mediated endocytosis, autophagy, and cell signalling. Full-length PRR is cleaved at a conserved consensus motif (R-X-X-R↓) by a member of the proprotein convertase family to generate sPRR, and a smaller C-terminal fragment, designated M8.9. It is unclear which convertase processes PRR in prostate cancer cells and how processing affects V-ATPase activity. In the current study we show that PRR is predominantly cleaved by PACE4, a proprotein convertase that has been previously implicated in prostate cancer. We further demonstrate that PTEN controls PRR processing in mouse tissue and controls PACE4 expression in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PACE4 cleavage of PRR is needed for efficient V-ATPase activity and prostate cancer cell growth.

Methods:   To evaluate the relationship between HPV genotypes and genomic alterations in PCa, HPV capture sequencing of DNA isolated from 59 Han Chinese PCa patients was performed using an Illumina HiSeq2500. Additionally, whole-exome sequencing of DNA from these 59 PCa tissue samples and matched normal tissues was carried out using the BGI DNBSEQ platform. HPV infection status and genotyping were determined, and the genetic disparities between HPV-positive and HPV-negative PCa were evaluated.  Results:   The presence of the high-risk HPV genome was identified in 16.9% of our cohort, and HPV16 was the most frequent genotype detected. The overall mutational burden in HPV-positive and HPV-negative PCa was similar, with an average of 2.68/Mb versus 2.58/Mb, respectively, in the targeted whole-exome region. HPV-negative tumors showed a mutational spectrum concordant with published PCa analyses with enrichment for mutations in SPOP, FOXA1, and MED12. HPV-positive tumors showed more mutations in KMT2C, KMT2D and ERCC2. Copy number alterations per sample were comparable between the two groups. However, the significantly amplified or deleted regions of the two groups only partially overlapped. We identified amplifications in oncogenes, including FCGR2B and CCND1, and deletions of tumor suppressors, such as CCNC and RB1, only in HPV-negative tumors. HPV-positive tumors showed unique deletions of tumor suppressors such as NTRK1 and JAK1.  Conclusions:   The genomic mutational landscape of PCa differs based on HPV infection status.

Proxalutamide, an AR antagonist, was shown in initial clinical studies to benefit COVID-19 patients; however, further validation is needed as one study was retracted. Due to continued interest in proxalutamide, which is in phase 3 trials, we examined its ability to impact SARS-CoV-2 infection and downstream inflammatory responses. Proxalutamide exerted similar effects as enzalutamide, an AR antagonist prescribed for advanced prostate cancer, in decreasing AR signaling and expression of TMPRSS2 and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. However, proxalutamide led to degradation of AR protein, which was not observed with enzalutamide. Proxalutamide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection with an IC50 value of 97 nM, compared to 281 nM for enzalutamide. Importantly, proxalutamide inhibited infection by multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants and synergized with remdesivir. Proxalutamide protected against cell death in response to tumor necrosis factor alpha and interferon gamma, and overall survival of mice was increased with proxalutamide treatment prior to cytokine exposure. Mechanistically, we found that proxalutamide increased levels of NRF2, an essential transcription factor that mediates antioxidant responses, and decreased lung inflammation. These data provide compelling evidence that proxalutamide can prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytokine-induced lung damage, suggesting that promising clinical data may emerge from ongoing phase 3 trials.""","""['Yuanyuan Qiao', 'Jesse W Wotring', 'Yang Zheng', 'Charles J Zhang', 'Yuping Zhang', 'Xia Jiang', 'Carla D Pretto', 'Sanjana Eyunni', 'Abhijit Parolia', 'Tongchen He', 'Caleb Cheng', 'Xuhong Cao', 'Rui Wang', 'Fengyun Su', 'Stephanie J Ellison', 'Yini Wang', 'Jun Qin', 'Honghua Yan', 'Qianxiang Zhou', 'Liandong Ma', 'Jonathan Z Sexton', 'Arul M Chinnaiyan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A""","""[]"""

Surgery has emerged as a popular method in treating metastatic epidural spinal cord compression (MESCC) due to the advances in surgical techniques and instrumentation. In this study, we evaluated patients with MESCC regarding neurological status, pain status, and survival rates, and presented our experience managing MESCC.  Patients and methods:   Clinical and radiographic records of 53 patients diagnosed with MESCC between January 2011 and March 2017 were retrospectively evaluated. The study included patients with a pathological diagnosis of primary cancer, those who complained of spinal metastasis, and those who had indications of MESCC on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Bone structure and spinal stability were evaluated using assessed Computed Tomography (CT), and metastatic spread was considered using assessed Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in suitable cases. For each patient, the presence of a tumor compressing the spinal cord, age, gender, preoperative, and postoperative American Spinal Injury Association scores (ASIA), Tokuhashi prognostic score (TPS), affected spinal segment, pathological diagnosis, preoperative, and postoperative Visual Analog Scale (VAS), the status of spinal stability, follow-up period, and complications were evaluated.  Results:   Forty-five patients (82.2% of them were women) underwent surgery with a mean age of 58.29 ± 15.14 years. The most frequent type of primary tumor was multiple myeloma (33.9%), followed by lung (24.6%), gastric (7.5%), and prostate (5.7%). The most common site of metastasis was the thoracic region (43.4%), followed by lumbar (24.5%), multiple (24.5%), and cervical (5.7%). The analysis indicated that a significant difference was found between the survival rates of the TPS categories.  Conclusions:   Common symptoms of MESCC include spinal pain and neurological deficit below the level of the injury. Prompt surgical treatment followed by oncological treatment leads to significant neurological recovery, more prolonged survival, pain relief, and improved quality of life in patients with a short survival time. Oncological treatments, including radiotherapy (RT), should be recommended after surgical treatment.""","""['A Aycan', 'B Eren', 'A Tas', 'S Celik', 'F Karagoz Guzey', 'F Kuyumcu', 'M E Akyol', 'E Saglam', 'N Aycan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci""","""[]"""

Herein, a series of steroid analogs were designed, synthesized, and identified as selective AR degraders, among which YXG-158 (23-h) was the most potent antitumor compound with dual functions of AR degradation and CYP17A1 inhibition. In addition, 23-h abrogated the hERG inhibition and exhibited excellent PK profiles. In vivo, 23-h effectively inhibited the growth of hormone-sensitive organs in the Hershberger assay and exhibited robust antitumor efficacy both in enzalutamide-sensitive (LNCaP/AR) and enzalutamide-resistant (C4-2b-ENZ) xenograft models.

A typical analysis pipeline in using IR imaging data for chemical pathology often involves iterative processes of segmentation, evaluation, and analysis that necessitate rapid data exploration. Here, we present a fast, reliable, and intuitive method based on a phasor representation of spectra and discuss its unique applicability for IR imaging data. We simulate different features extant in IR spectra and discuss their influence on the phasor waveforms; similarly, we undertake IR image analysis in the transform space to understand spectral similarity and variance. We demonstrate the potential of phasor analysis for biomedical tissue imaging using a variety of samples, using fresh frozen surgical prostate resections and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue microarray samples as model systems that span common histopathology practice. To demonstrate further generalizability of this approach, we apply the method to data from different experimental conditions─including standard (5.5 μm × 5.5 μm pixel size) and high-definition (1.1 μm × 1.1 μm pixel size) Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectroscopic imaging using transmission and transflection modes. Quantitative segmentation results from our approach are compared to previous studies, showing good agreement and quick visualization.

This study proposes a novel network-based drug repositioning approach, which computes similarities between disease-causing genes and drug-affected genes in a network topology to suggest candidate drugs with highest similarity scores. This new method aims to identify better treatment options by integrating systems biology approaches. It uses a protein-protein interaction network that is the main topology to compute a similarity score between candidate drugs and disease-causing genes. The disease-causing genes were mapped on this network structure. Transcriptome profiles of drug candidates were taken from the LINCS project and mapped individually on the network structure. The similarity of these two networks was calculated by different network neighborhood metrics, including Adamic-Adar, PageRank and neighborhood scoring. The proposed approach identifies the best candidates by choosing the drugs with significant similarity scores. The method was experimented on melanoma, colorectal, and prostate cancers. Several candidate drugs were predicted by applying AUC values of 0.6 or higher. Some of the predictions were approved by clinical phase trials or other in-vivo studies found in literature.

Case presentation:   This study reports the case of a 77-year-old man who presented with acute urinary retention and dysuria and was admitted to our hospital. Physical and digital rectal examinations were conducted and revealed the overfilling of the suprapubic bladder and a slightly enlarged prostate without palpable nodules, respectively. The patient was tested negative for total and free prostate antigens (PSA) and had large masses in the upper lobes of both lungs and an irregularly enlarged prostate in the computed tomography images. The patient was inserted immediately with 18F triple-cavity Foley catheter to drain haematuria with blood clots. The patient was treated with electric coagulation haemostasis and transurethral resection of the prostate and subjected to postoperative histopathological analysis, which revealed the diagnosis of SCC. The patient was advised to undergo further radiation therapy and chemotherapy but rejected all follow-up treatments for lungs and prostate. The patient recovered uneventfully and was discharged 7 days after the operation. The patient remained alive after 6 months of follow-up.

Methods:   This secondary analysis included data from 257 men who identified as Black or African American and were diagnosed with prostate cancer between 2013 and 2018. Participants completed validated self-report measures of perceived history of racial discrimination, religiosity, fatalism, sociodemographic (e.g., age, ethnicity, income) and clinical characteristics (e.g., years since diagnosis, comorbidity burden), and leisure-time physical activity. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the associations between sociocultural factors and mild, moderate, and vigorous physical activity.  Results:   Participants were on average 68.7 years old (SD = 7.7), and most were non-Hispanic (97.3%), married (68.9%), reported an annual household income above $50,000 (57.1%), received at least some college education (74.1%), and were overweight or had obesity (78.5%).

Their behaviour in water under physiological conditions has been studied by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing their hydrolytic stability. Interactions of the novel compounds with duplex-deoxiribonucleic acid (dsDNA) were investigated by different techniques and the results indicate that, under physiological pH and saline conditions, the metal glycoconjugates bind DNA in the minor groove and/or through external, electrostatic interactions, and by a non-classical, partial intercalation mechanism in non-saline phosphate buffered solution. Effects of compounds 1-4 on cell viability have been assessed in vitro against two human cell lines (androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 and non-tumorigenic prostate RWPE-1), showing moderate cytotoxicities, with IC50 values higher than those found for free ligands [N-(1,10-phenanthroline-5-yl)-β-glycopyranosylamine] (glycopyranosyl = d-glucopyranosyl (a), D-mannopyranosyl (b), L-rhamnopyranosyl (c) and l-xylopyranosyl (d)) or corresponding metal-aglycone.

We examined whether circulating tumor cells (CTCs) identify patients with altered p300/CBP acetylation. CTCs were isolated from 13 advanced PC patients using Exclusion-based Sample Preparation (ESP) technology. Bound cells underwent immunofluorescent staining for histone modifying enzymes (HMEs) of interest and image capture with NIS-Elements software. Using the cBioPortal PCF/SU2C dataset, the response of CRPC to androgen receptor signaling inhibitors (ARSI) was analyzed in 50 subjects. Staining optimization and specificity revealed clear expression of acetyl-p300, acetyl-H3K18, and SIRT2 on CTCs (CK positive, CD45 negative cells). Exposure to A-485, a selective p300/CBP catalytic inhibitor, reduced p300 and H3K18 acetylation. In CRPC patients, a-p300 strongly correlated with its target acetylated H3k18 (Pearson's R = 0.61), and SIRT2 expression showed robust negative correlation with a-H3k18 (R = -0.60). A subgroup of CRPC patients (6/11; 55%) demonstrated consistent upregulation of acetylation based on these markers. To examine the clinical impact of upregulation of the CBP/p300 axis, CRPC patients with reduced deacetylase SIRT2 expression demonstrate shorter response times to ARSI therapy (5.9 vs. 12 mo; p = 0.03). A subset of CRPC patients demonstrate increased p300/CBP activity based on a novel CTC biomarker assay.

This study reports the antiproliferative potential of THF in prostate cancer cell line via reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cascades and examines the tumour reduction potential in swiss albino mice. The potency of THF was evaluated by employing cytotoxicity assays and wound healing assays. Cell cycle, ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and Annexin-V-FITC assay were performed using a flow cytometer. In vivo, anticancer potential was achieved using the mice Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) model. THF inhibits cell growth with IC50 of 64.30 µM (MTT), 81.22 µM (NRU) and 25.81 µM (SRB), substantiated by cell migration assay. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that THF increases the subdiploid population. Furthermore, the Annexin-V-FITC assay evoked a significant induction of late apoptosis at a higher concentration of THF. THF also disrupts MMP, caused by an increased generation of ROS. In the EAC model, THF significantly inhibits tumour growth and increases the percent survival of mice and ROS levels in EAC cells. Hence, it may be concluded that THF might execute its antiproliferative effect via inducing ROS generation and could be a promising lead for preclinical and clinical validations.""","""['Waseem Raza', 'Abha Meena', 'Suaib Luqman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Biochem Mol Toxicol""","""[]"""

This study aims to establish a computational homogenization framework for quantifying the mechanical behaviour of prostate tissue, considering its multiphasic heterogeneous microstructures and the mechanical characteristics of tissue constituents. Representative tissue microstructure models were reconstructed from high-resolution histology images. Parametric studies on the mechanical properties of the tissue constituents, particularly the fibre-reinforced hyper-elasticity of the stromal tissue, were carried out to investigate their effects on the apparent tissue properties. These were then benchmarked against the experimental data reported in literature. Results showed significant anisotropy, both structural and mechanical, and tension-compression asymmetry of the apparent behaviours of the prostatic tissue. Strong correlation with the key microstructural indices such as area fractions of tissue constituents and the tissue fabric tensor was also observed. The correlation between the stromal tissue orientation and the principal directions of the apparent properties suggested an essential role of stromal tissue in determining the directions of anisotropy and the compression-tension asymmetry characteristics in normal human prostatic tissue.

Methods:   This retrospective study included 80 consecutive patients who had an mpMRI and a prostate biopsy for suspected prostate cancer. Two radiologists in consensus interpreted mpMRI and performed texture analysis based on their histopathology. The first-, second-, and higher-order texture parameters were extracted from mpMRI and were compared between groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using the texture parameters to determine the independent predictors of csPCa. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to assess the diagnostic performance of the texture parameters.  Results:   : In the periferal zone, 39 men had csPCa, while 41 had benign lesions or clinically insignificant prostate cancer (cisPCa). Themajority of texture parameters showed statistically significant differences between the groups. Univariate ROC analysis showed that the ADC mean and ADC median were the best variables in differentiating csPCa (p < 0.001). The first-order logistic regression model (mean + entropy) based on the ADC maps had a higher AUC value (0.996; 95% CI: 0.989-1) than other texture-based logistic regression models (p < 0.001).

Methods:   A phenotypic screen was performed to identify novel inhibitors of chemoresistant PCa cells.

The in vivo efficacy was evaluated in mouse xenograft models of chemoresistant PCa.  Results:   Nicardipine exhibited high selectivity and potency against chemoresistant PCa cells via inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Computational, molecular, and cellular studies identified nicardipine as a putative inhibitor of embryonic ectoderm development (EED) protein, and the results are consistent with a proposed mechanism of action that nicardipine destabilised enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and inhibited key components of noncanonical EZH2 signalling, including transducer and activator of transcription 3, S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, ATP binding cassette B1, and survivin.

Methods: Peptides were labeled with 64Cu (80 °C, 1.0 M NaOAc, pH 5.50) and 68Ga (90 °C, 0.25 M NaOAc, pH 4.50). GRPR affinity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, room temperature, 2 h) and GRPR-mediated internalization (37 °C, 60 min) were examined on PC-3 cells. Biodistribution studies were performed at 1 h after injection in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice. For a first-in-humans application, 173 MBq of [68Ga]Ga-AMTG were administered intravenously and whole-body PET/CT scans were acquired at 75 min after injection. Results: 64Cu- and 68Ga-labeling proceeded almost quantitatively (>98%). All compounds revealed similarly high GRPR affinity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, 1.5-4.0 nM) and high receptor-bound fractions (79%-84% of cell-associated activity). In vivo, high activity levels (percentage injected dose per gram) were found in the PC-3 tumor (14.1-15.1 %ID/g) and the pancreas (12.6-30.7 %ID/g), whereas further off-target accumulation was low at 1 h after injection, except for elevated liver uptake observed for both 64Cu-labeled compounds. Overall biodistribution profiles and tumor-to-background ratios were comparable but slightly enhanced for the 68Ga-labeled analogs in most organs. [68Ga]Ga-AMTG confirmed the favorable pharmacokinetics-as evident from preclinical studies-in a patient with metastasized castration-resistant PCa showing intense uptake in several lesions. Conclusion: AMTG is eligible for theranostic use, as labeling with 64Cu and 68Ga, as well as 177Lu (known from previous study), does not have a negative influence on its favorable biodistribution pattern.

Methods:   A multifeature classifier was constructed to predict clinical outcomes using plasma-based genomic alterations detected in 120 genes and 772 lipidomic species as informative features in a cohort of 71 patients with mHSPC and 144 patients with mCRPC. Outcomes of interest were collected over 11 years of follow-up. These included in mHSPC state early failure of androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) and exceptional responders to ADT; early death (poor prognosis) and long-term survivors in mCRPC state. The approach was to build binary classification models that identified discriminative candidates with optimal weights to predict outcomes. To achieve this, we built multi-omic feature-based classifiers using traditional machine learning (ML) methods, including logistic regression with sparse regularization, multi-kernel Gaussian process regression, and support vector machines.  Results:   The levels of specific ceramides (d18:1/14:0 and d18:1/17:0), and the presence of CHEK2 mutations, AR amplification, and RB1 deletion were identified as the most crucial factors associated with clinical outcomes. Using ML models, the optimal multi-omics feature combination determined resulted in AUC scores of 0.751 for predicting mHSPC survival and 0.638 for predicting ADT failure; and in mCRPC state, 0.687 for prognostication and 0.727 for exceptional survival. The models were observed to be superior than using a limited candidate number of features for developing multi-omic prognostic and predictive signatures.  Conclusion:   Using a ML approach that incorporates multiple omic features improves the prediction accuracy for metastatic prostate cancer outcomes significantly. Validation of these models will be needed in independent data sets in future.""","""['Shikai Fang', 'Shandian Zhe', 'Hui-Ming Lin', 'Arun A Azad', 'Heidi Fettke', 'Edmond M Kwan', 'Lisa Horvath', 'Blossom Mak', 'Tiantian Zheng', 'Pan Du', 'Shidong Jia', 'Robert M Kirby', 'Manish Kohli']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""JCO Clin Cancer Inform""","""[]"""

Methods:   An international workgroup developed guidance on clinical management of CHEK2 heterozygotes informed by peer-reviewed publications from PubMed.  Results:   Although CHEK2 is considered a moderate penetrance gene, cancer risks may be considered as a continuous variable, which are influenced by family history and other modifiers. Consequently, early cancer detection and prevention for CHEK2 heterozygotes should be guided by personalized risk estimates. Such estimates may result in both downgrading lifetime breast cancer risks to those similar to the general population or upgrading lifetime risk to a level at which CHEK2 heterozygotes are offered high-risk breast surveillance according to country-specific guidelines. Risk-reducing mastectomy should be guided by personalized risk estimates and shared decision making. Colorectal and prostate cancer surveillance should be considered based on assessment of family history. For CHEK2 heterozygotes who develop cancer, no specific targeted medical treatment is recommended at this time.

Purpose To assess the diagnostic accuracy of prebiopsy multiparametric MRI in the identification of clinically significant PCa (csPCa) using radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens as the reference standard, and to test the diagnostic accuracy of combined US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsy with systematic biopsies. Materials and Methods In a prospective randomized controlled trial including university hospitals, men with suspected PCa were recruited between January 2015 and August 2020 to assess the diagnostic accuracy of multiparametric MRI before biopsy in detection of csPCa at biopsy and RP histopathologic structure (primary outcome). Men with lesions suspicious for cancer (Prostate Imaging and Reporting Data System [PI-RADS] ≥3) at multiparametric MRI were first randomized to either systematic random prostate biopsies alone (control group) or US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsies with systematic random prostate biopsies (intervention group) at a one-to-one ratio to compare the diagnostic accuracy of systematic random versus combined fusion with systematic random biopsies (secondary outcome). A subset of recruited participants (n = 89) underwent RP and histologic sectioning. Results There were 582 participants who were eligible to undergo multiparametric MRI (mean age, 65 years ± 6 [SD]). In total, 413 had a PI-RADS score of at least 3 and were randomized into either the intervention group (207 of 413; 50.1%) or control group (206 of 413; 49.9%). The csPCa detection rate in the intervention group was higher, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.79 (95% CI: 1.14, 2.79; P = .01). A subgroup of 89 men underwent RP (21.5%; 89 of 413). Multiparametric MRI helped correctly identify 131 of 182 csPCa foci in 89 men (sensitivity, 72%; 95% CI: 65, 78). The specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 71% (91 of 128), 78% (131 of 168), and 64% (91 of 142), respectively. Conclusion Prebiopsy multiparametric MRI was accurate in the depiction of clinically significant PCa. Combining US and MRI fusion-targeted biopsies with systematic biopsies helped detect more clinically significant lesions than did systematic biopsies alone. Clinical trial registration no.

The stability of the complexes in aqueous buffer solution (pH 7.4) was confirmed by UV/Vis spectroscopy. The cytotoxicity of the complexes (1-8) was then evaluated on prostate cancer cells (PC3), showing a low nanomolar to low micromolar in vitro cytotoxicity. Worthy of note, three of the Re(I) tricarbonyl complexes showed very low (IC50 = 30-50 nM) cytotoxic activity against PC3 cells and up to 26-fold selectivity over normal human retinal pigment epithelial-1 (RPE-1) cells. The cytotoxicity of both complexes 3 and 6 was lowered under hypoxic conditions in PC3 cells. However, the compounds were still 10 times more active than cisplatin in these conditions. Additional biological experiments were then performed on the most selective complexes (complexes 3 and 6). Cell fractioning experiments followed by ICP-MS studies revealed that 3 and 6 accumulate mostly in the mitochondria and nucleus, respectively. Despite the respective mitochondrial and nuclear localization of 3 and 6, 3 did not trigger the apoptosis pathways for cell killing, whereas 6 can trigger apoptosis but not as a major pathway. Complex 3 induced a paraptosis pathway for cell killing while 6 did not induce any of our other tested pathways, namely, necrosis, paraptosis, and autophagy. Both complexes 3 and 6 were found to be involved in mitochondrial dysfunction and downregulated the ATP production of PC3 cells.

However, decision-making regarding prostate biopsy and prebiopsy examinations is still difficult. We aimed to establish a quick and economic tool to improve the detection of csPCa based on routinely performed clinical examinations through an automated machine learning platform (AutoML).  Methods:   This study included a multicenter retrospective cohort and two prospective cohorts with 4747 cases from 9 hospitals across China. The multimodal data, including demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, and ultrasound reports, of consecutive participants were retrieved using extract-transform-load tools. AutoML was applied to explore potential data processing patterns and the most suitable algorithm to build the Prostate Cancer Artificial Intelligence Diagnostic System (PCAIDS). The diagnostic performance was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for discriminating csPCa from insignificant prostate cancer (PCa) and benign disease. The clinical utility was evaluated by decision curve analysis (DCA) and waterfall plots.  Results:   The random forest algorithm was applied in the feature selection, and the AutoML algorithm was applied for model establishment. The area under the curve (AUC) value in identifying csPCa was 0.853 in the training cohort, 0.820 in the validation cohort, 0.807 in the Changhai prospective cohort, and 0.850 in the Zhongda prospective cohort. DCA showed that the PCAIDS was superior to PSA or fPSA/tPSA for diagnosing csPCa with a higher net benefit for all threshold probabilities in all cohorts. Setting a fixed sensitivity of 95%, a total of 32.2%, 17.6%, and 26.3% of unnecessary biopsies could be avoided with less than 5% of csPCa missed in the validation cohort, Changhai and Zhongda prospective cohorts, respectively.  Conclusions:   The PCAIDS was an effective tool to inform decision-making regarding the need for prostate biopsy and prebiopsy examinations such as mpMRI.

Radiation vascular response, due to endothelial disruption, can influence treatment outcomes in a dose-dependent manner. Ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles (USMB) have also been demonstrated to create a vascular response in the tumor microenvironment and enhance tumor response when used in combination with XRT. Single doses of 8-10 Gy are known to induce activation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase)-induced ceramide production, causing vascular damage. Destruction of vasculature results in endothelial apoptosis followed by tumor cell death. The effect of tumor response is known to be synergistic by 10-fold higher cell kill observed when USMB is combined with radiation.  Methods:   In this study, we used an USMB approach in combination with conventional low dose fractionated radiation to enhance endothelial cell responses to XRT in human PC3 prostate cancer xenograft model. Mice were divided into untreated, USMB therapy, fractionated XRT, and combined USMB therapy followed by XRT (USMB + XRT) groups. USMB therapy was delivered twice per week in the USMB-alone and combined USMB + XRT treatment groups over four weeks. Radiation treatments were delivered in fractions of 2 Gy/day (total 40 Gy in 20 fractions, BED10 = 48 Gy) in the XRT-alone and combined USMB + XRT groups. The treatment outcome was evaluated using histopathology, power Doppler, and immunohistochemistry assays.  Results:   Tumor growth assessment showed that sizes of tumors increased in the control and the single treatment groups over a treatment period of four weeks, but significantly decreased with the combined treatments of USMB + XRT. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a statistically significant vascular disruption in mice that received treatment involving a full 4-week schedule of combined (USMB + XRT) treatments. A statistically significant increase in vascular disruption was demonstrated through CD68 and trichrome fibrosis staining. Changes in local perfusion assessed using high-frequency power Doppler imaging demonstrated attenuated blood flow in the combined group.  Discussion and conclusions:   This work demonstrates the efficacy of using USMB as a radiation sensitizer in a mouse model of human PC3 tumor xenograft. This radiation treatment enhancement modality has the advantage of targeting tumor vasculature with ultrasound stimulation that can be implemented prior to radiation treatment.""","""['Deepa Sharma#', 'Evan McNabb#', 'Niki Law', 'Aaron Cumal', 'Gregory J Czarnota']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""BMC Cancer""","""[]"""

Although GGCT is a promising target for cancer therapy, the mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects remain unclear. The knockdown of GGCT inhibited the MEK-ERK pathway, and activated the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene (RB) at the protein level in cancer cell lines. c-Met was down-regulated by the knockdown of GGCT in cancer cells and its overexpression attenuated the dephosphorylation of RB and cell cycle arrest induced by the knockdown of GGCT in lung cancer A549 cells. STAT3 is a transcription factor that induces c-Met expression. STAT3 phosphorylation and its nuclear expression level were decreased in GGCT-depleted A549 and prostate cancer PC3 cells. The simultaneous knockdown of AMPK and GGCT restored the down-regulated expression of c-Met, and attenuated the dephosphorylation of STAT3 and MEK-ERK-RB induced by the knockdown of GGCT in PC3 cells. An intraperitoneal injection of a GGCT inhibitor decreased c-Met protein expression in a mouse xenograft model of PC3 cells.

To counter this, we developed a new approach to modulate the AR and inhibit castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) using multivalent peptoid conjugates (MPCs) that contain multiple copies of the AR-targeting ligand ethisterone attached to a peptidomimetic scaffold. Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of compound MPC309, a trivalent display of ethisterone conjugated to a peptoid oligomer backbone that binds to the AR with nanomolar affinity. MPC309 exhibited potent antiproliferative effects on various enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer models, including those with AR splice variants, ligand binding mutations, and non-canonical AR gene expression programs, as well as mouse prostate organoids harboring defined genetic alterations that mimic lethal human prostate cancer subtypes. MPC309 is taken up by cells through macropinocytosis, an endocytic process more prevalent in cancer cells than in normal ones, thus providing an opportunity to target tumors selectively. MPC309 triggers a distinct AR transcriptome compared to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and enzalutamide, a clinically used anti-androgen. Specifically, MPC309 enhances the expression of differentiation genes while reducing the expression of genes needed for cell division and metabolism. Mechanistically, MPC309 increases AR chromatin occupancy and alters AR interactions with coregulatory proteins in a pattern distinct from DHT. In xenograft studies, MPC309 produced significantly greater tumor suppression than enzalutamide.

Tetramers offer potential solutions for the unknown underlying mechanisms and intermediary phenotypes connecting a chemical exposure to a disease. Additionally, multiple tetramers can be assembled to construct detailed modes-of-action for chemical-induced disease pathways. As well, tetramers can help inform environmental influences on adverse outcome pathways (AOPs). We demonstrate the tool's utility with relevant use cases for a variety of environmental chemicals (e.g., perfluoroalkyl substances, bisphenol A), phenotypes (e.g., apoptosis, spermatogenesis, inflammatory response), and diseases (e.g., asthma, obesity, male infertility). Finally, we map AOP adverse outcome terms to corresponding CTD terms, allowing users to query for tetramers that can help augment AOP pathways with additional stressors, genes, and phenotypes, as well as formulate potential AOP disease networks (e.g., liver cirrhosis and prostate cancer).

Principal component analysis (PCA) of the NMR dataset revealed α-glucose, sucrose, and isorhamnetin as markers for fruit and stem and unsaturated fatty acids for predominated seeds. Orthogonal projections to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed trigonelline as a major distinctive metabolite in the immature fruit and isorhamnetin as a major distinct marker in the mature fruit. UPLC-MS/MS analysis using feature-based molecular networks revealed diverse chemical classes viz. steroidal saponins, N-containing metabolites, phenolics, fatty acids, and lipids as the constitutive metabolome in Balanites. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) profiling of primary metabolites led to the detection of 135 peaks belonging to sugars, fatty acids/esters, amino acids, nitrogenous, and organic acids. Monosaccharides were detected at much higher levels in ripe fruit and disaccharides in predominate unripe fruits, whereas B. aegyptiaca vegetative parts (leaves and stem) were rich in amino acids and fatty acids. The antidiabetic compounds, viz, nicotinic acid, and trigonelline, were detected in all parts especially unripe fruit in addition to the sugar alcohol d-pinitol for the first time providing novel evidence for B. aegyptiaca use in diabetes.

The aim of this observational study was to examine the prevalence of comorbidities, and the relationship of comorbidity burden to HRQoL and other patient-reported outcomes (PROs) among men with APC.  Methods:   Participants were 192 men (average age 68.8) with APC (stage III or IV) who completed a psychosocial battery including measures of sociodemographic factors, HRQoL and other PROs, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between CCI, HRQOL, and PROs.  Results:   The vast majority (82%) of participants had at least one comorbidity, with the most common being: hypertension (59%), connective tissue disease or arthritis (31%), diabetes (24%), and problems with kidneys, vision, or another organ (24%). After controlling for covariates, regressions showed that a higher CCI score was significantly associated with worse HRQoL (p < 0.001), lower levels of positive affect (p < 0.05), and higher levels of depression (p < 0.05), fatigue (p < 0.001), pain (p < 0.01), stress (p < 0.01), and cancer-specific distress (p < 0.05).  Conclusions:   Comorbidities were common among men with APC, and a greater CCI score was associated with detriments in several domains of HRQoL and other PROs.

Results:   Palliative care was chosen more often for a patient with advanced prostate cancer (83%) than for a patient with advanced dementia (41%) (both patients males, same age). A suspicion of iatrogenic bleeding in the prostate cancer patient decreased the willingness to choose palliative care, especially among the students. Patient benefit was regarded as an important background factor in decision making by all respondent groups, but physicians' legal protection was not considered as important among the physicians with cPM as it was among the other respondent groups.

Medicare provides Diabetes Self-Management Training (DSMT) program to beneficiaries to achieve normal metabolic control and reduce the risk of micro and macro-vascular complications. This study aimed to examine the trend of DSMT utilization among cancer survivors and assess individual characteristics associated with it.  Methods:   The data for this study was from Texas Cancer Registry-Medicare linkage data of patients with prostate, breast, or colorectal cancer diagnosed in 1999-2017. Outcome variables include the number of first-time DSMT users, the number of total users, and the average number of DSMT utilization in minutes. We performed logistic regression and gamma regression to obtain a multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for the association between DSMT utilization and individual characteristics.  Results:   The number of first-time users has slowly increased over the years (from 99 to 769 per 1,000) but suddenly dropped after 2016. The number of all users (first-time and follow-up users) has increased (from 123 to 1,201 per 1,000) and plateaued after 2016. Determinants including Hispanic ethnicity (O.R. = 1.10) and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility (O.R. = 1.25) are positively associated with both the initiation and retention of the DSMT. A barrier to both initiation and retention of DSMT is living in a metropolitan area (O.R. = 0.90).  Conclusions:   Multi-level strategies to enhance accessibility and availability of DSMT programs for Medicare beneficiaries are highly recommended. Examining the determinants of initiation and retention of DSMT over 14 years provides insights on strategies to meet the needs of cancer survivors and reduce the burden of diabetes on them.""","""['Wei-Chen Lee', 'Biai Dominique Elmir Digbeu', 'Hani Serag', 'Hanaa Sallam', 'Yong-Fang Kuo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""PLoS One""","""[]"""

Forty-six (63%) patients developed CRPC and 34 (47%) died during the follow-up. The median time to CRPC and median OS were 16.2 and 58.4 months, respectively. The risk of CRPC was higher for patients with high (above median) values of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (HR=2.4; 95% CI [1.4-4.5]), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (HR=1.98; 95% CI [1.1-3.7]), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (HR=1.8; 95% CI [1.1-3]), ECOG performance status >1 (HR=2; 95% CI [1.2-3.3]) and HV disease (HR=1.9; 95% CI [1.1-3.1]).

Therefore, a RA-loaded PEGylated liposome drug delivery system was devised in this study.  Methods:   Hydrogenated soybean phospholipids (HSPC), 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-Polyethyleneglycol-2000 (sodium salt) (DSPE-PEG2k), cholesterol (CHO), and RA were utilised to prepare a RA-loaded liposome (LRA) drug delivery system via the thin film hydration technique., The drug loading content was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. Dynamic light scattering was employed to evaluate the drug's particle size and stability. Methyl tetrazolium, colony formation, and Western blot (WB) were used in vitro to elucidate the inhibitory effect and mechanism of LRA on prostate cancer cells. Finally, xenograft model was used to confirm the tumor-inhibiting efficacy, clarify the mechanism, and determine the biosafety in mice.  Results:   LRA has stable physicochemical properties and a diameter of 173.5 15.3 nm. LRA inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. LRA can substantially reduce the expression of AR and HMGB1, induce apoptosis, regulate the expression of cell cycle-related proteins in vitro and in vivo.

Adopting diagnostic criteria in population-based screening and ignoring PSA progression are presumed leading causes.  Methods:   A total of 31,942 participants with multi-round PSA tests from the PLCO trial were included. Time-dependent receiver-operating-characteristic curves and area under curves (tdAUCs) were performed to determine the screening reference level and the optimal subgroup-specific progression indicator. Effects of risk-stratified multi-round PSA screening were evaluated with multivariable Cox regression and measured with hazard ratio [HR (95%CIs)].  Results:   After a median follow-up of 11.6 years, a total of 3484 PCa cases and 216 PCa deaths were documented. The tdAUC of 10-year incidence PCa with PSA was 0.816, and the cut-off value was 1.61 ng/ml. Compared to subgroup with stable negative PSA in both first-round (FR) and last-round (LR) tests [FR(-)/LR(-)], HRs (95%CI) of PCa incidence were 1.66 (1.20-2.29), 8.29 (7.25-9.48), and 14.52 (12.95-16.28) for subgroups with loss of positive PSA[FR(+)/LR(-)], gain of positive PSA[FR(-)/LR(+)], and stable positive PSA[FR(+)/LR(+)]; while HRs(95%CI) of PCa mortality were 1.47 (0.52-4.15), 5.71 (3.68-8.86), and 5.01 (3.41-7.37). After excluding regressive PSA [(namely FR(+)/LR(-)], absolute velocity was the shared optimal progression indicator for subgroups with FR(-)/LR(-), FR(-)/LR(+), and FR(+)/LR(+), with tdAUCs of 0.665, 0.681 and 0.741, and cut-off values of 0.07, 0.21, and 0.33 ng/ml/year. After reclassifying participants into groups with positive and negative progression based on subgroup-specific progression indicators, incidence HR (95%CI) were 2.41 (1.87-3.10), 2.91 (2.43-3.48), and 3.16 (2.88-3.46) for positive progression compared to negative progression within subgroups of FR(-)/LR(-), FR(-)/LR(+), and FR(+)/LR(+), while mortality HR (95%CI) were 2.22 (0.91-5.38), 2.37 (1.28-4.38), and 2.98 (1.94-4.59). To improve screening performances by excluding regressive PSA and low-risk positive progression in FR(-)/LR(-), optimized screening strategy not only significantly reduce 32.4% of missed PCa (54.0% [1881/3484] vs. 21.6% [754/3484], P < 0.001), but also detected additional 8.0% of high-grade PCa (Gleason score 7-10: 36.0% [665/1849] vs. 28.0% [206/736], P < 0.001) than traditional screening strategy.

Bone metastases are the most prevalent metastatic site for advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Therefore, finding new immunotherapy targets in PCa patients with bone metastasis is urgently needed. We conducted an elaborative bioinformatics study of immune-related genes (IRGs) and tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in PCa bone metastases. Databases were integrated to obtain RNA-sequencing data and clinical prognostic information. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to construct an overall survival (OS) prediction model. GSE32269 was analyzed to acquire differentially expressed IRGs. The OS prediction model was established by employing six IRGs (MAVS, HSP90AA1, FCGR3A, CTSB, FCER1G, and CD4). The CIBERSORT algorithm was adopted to assess the proportion of TIICs in each group. Furthermore, Transwell, MTT, and wound healing assays were employed to determine the effect of MAVS on PCa cells. High-risk patients had worse OS compared to the low-risk patients in the training and validation cohorts. Meanwhile, clinically practical nomograms were generated using these identified IRGs to predict the 3- and 5-year survival rates of patients. The infiltration percentages of some TIICs were closely linked to the risk score of the OS prediction model. Some tumor-infiltrating immune cells were related to the OS. FCGR3A was closely correlated with some TIICs. In vitro experiments verified that up-regulation of MAVS suppressed the proliferation and metastatic abilities of PCa cells.

Unfortunately, direct targeting of FOXA1 in progressive PCa remains challenging due to variations in FOXA1 protein levels, increased FOXA1 mutations at different stages of PCa, and elusive post-translational FOXA1 regulating mechanisms. Here, we show that SKP2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein 2) catalyzes K6- and K29-linked polyubiquitination of FOXA1 for lysosomal-dependent degradation. Our data indicate increased SKP2:FOXA1 protein ratios in stage IV human PCa compared to stages I-III, together with a strong inverse correlation (r=-0.9659) between SKP2 and FOXA1 levels, suggesting that SKP2-FOXA1 protein interactions play a significant role in PCa progression. Prostate tumors of Pten/Trp53 mice displayed increased Skp2-Foxa1-Pcna signaling and colocalization, whereas disruption of the Skp2-Foxa1 interplay in Pten/Trp53/Skp2 triple-null mice demonstrated decreased Pcna levels and increased expression of Foxa1 and luminal positive cells. Treatment of xenograft mice with the SKP2 inhibitor SZL P1-41 decreased tumor proliferation, SKP2:FOXA1 ratios and colocalization.

Microarray analysis revealed that ESS2 regulated mRNA levels of chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1 (CHD1)-related genes and other cancer-related genes, such as PPAR-γ, WNT5A, and TGF-β, in prostate cancer. ESS2 knockdown reduced nuclear factor (NF)-κB/CHD1 recruitment and histone H3K36me3 levels on the promoters of target genes (TNF and CCL2). In addition, we found that the transcriptional activities of NF-κB, NFAT and SMAD2/3 were enhanced by ESS2.

Endocrine therapies that impair the production of estrogen or the action of the ERα are therefore used to prevent primary disease metastasis. Although recent successes with ERα degraders have been reported, there is still the need to develop further ERα antagonists with additional properties for breast cancer therapy. We have previously described a benzothiazole compound A4B17 that inhibits the proliferation of androgen receptor-positive prostate cancer cells by disrupting the interaction of the cochaperone BAG1 with the AR. A4B17 was also found to inhibit the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells. Using a scaffold hopping approach, we report here a group of small molecules with imidazopyridine scaffolds that are more potent and efficacious than A4B17. The prototype molecule X15695 efficiently degraded ERα and attenuated estrogen-mediated target gene expression as well as transactivation by the AR. X15695 also disrupted key cellular protein-protein interactions such as BAG1-mortalin (GRP75) interaction as well as wild-type p53-mortalin or mutant p53-BAG2 interactions. These activities together reactivated p53 and resulted in cell-cycle block and the induction of apoptosis. When administered orally to in vivo tumor xenograft models, X15695 potently inhibited the growth of breast tumor cells but less efficiently the growth of prostate tumor cells. We therefore identify X15695 as an oral selective ER degrader and propose further development of this compound for therapy of ER+ breast cancers.  Significance:   An imidazopyridine that selectively degrades ERα and is orally bioavailable has been identified for the development of ER+ breast cancer therapeutics. This compound also activates wild-type p53 and disrupts the gain-of-function tumorigenic activity of mutant p53, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and the induction of apoptosis.""","""['Mengwu Pan#', 'Valeria Solozobova#', 'Nane C Kuznik', 'Nicole Jung', 'Simone Gräßle', 'Victor Gourain', 'Yvonne M Heneka', 'Christina A Cramer von Clausbruch', 'Olaf Fuhr', 'Ravi S N Munuganti', 'Danilo Maddalo', 'Christine Blattner', 'Antje Neeb', 'Adam Sharp', 'Laura Cato', 'Carsten Weiss', 'Rinath M Jeselsohn', 'Veronique Orian-Rousseau', 'Stefan Bräse', 'Andrew C B Cato']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""[]"""

In addition, with microarray analysis, gene ontology analysis and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes analysis, this study identified key genes and signaling pathways that influence the growth of PC-3 cells. Meanwhile, the effect of melittin on CRPC was also verified through subcutaneous tumor formation experiments. Finally, we also tested the relevant indicators of human prostate cancer (PCa) specimens through immunohistochemistry and H＆E stating.  Results:   Here, melittin was verified to inhibit the cell proliferation and migration of CPRC. Moreover, RNA-sequence analysis demonstrated that Interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway gene Lipocalin-2 (LCN2) was downregulated by melittin treatment in CRPC.

The second deadliest and third most common cancer is colorectal cancer (CRC). Papaya (Carica papaya Linn) seeds offer anti-cancer properties that can cure various types of cancer, such as liver and prostate cancer.  Methods:   The study aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of Carica papaya seed extract on colorectal cancer cell lines (Caco-2) and used techniques to assess the anti-cancer potential. The effectiveness of SE on cell proliferation and the viability of HTB-37 Caco-2 and C-166 cells were assessed using the MTT test. Real-time RT-PCR was used to measure gene expression levels and evaluate the activity of genes involved in apoptosis, including caspase-3, p53, Cycs, and Bcl-2. Finally, flow cytometry was used to analyze apoptosis induction by detecting changes in cell morphology and DNA content.  Results:   The study showed that the MTT reduction assay was dependent on cancer cell type and concentration of SE compared to the control cells and C-166, with a mean IC50 value of 9.734 ug/ml. The cytotoxicity was accompanied by some morphological alterations in the colorectal cancer cell line (Caco-2). The expression of the genes for p53, Cycs, and caspase-3 was substantially up-regulated, while Bcl-2 was dramatically down-regulated compared to control cells. The cell cycle arrested at the G2-M phase and the presence of early and late apoptotic characteristics post-treatment increased the apoptotic profile.

Objective:   The first-in-human evaluation of safety, pharmacokinetics, and exploratory efficacy of IS-002, a novel near-infrared prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted fluorescence imaging agent, designed for intraoperative prostate cancer visualization.  Design, setting, and participants:   A phase 1, single-center, dose-escalation study was conducted in 24 men with high-risk prostate cancer scheduled for robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy with (extended) pelvic lymph node dissection using the da Vinci surgical system.  Outcome measurements and statistical analysis:   Adverse events (AEs), vital signs, complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, urinalysis, and electrocardiogram were assessed over a 14-d period and compared with baseline. The pharmacokinetic profile of IS-002 was determined. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed for exploratory efficacy.  Results and limitations:   AEs predominantly included discoloration of urine (n = 22/24; expected, related, grade 1). There were no grade ≥2 AEs. IS-002 Cmax and area under the curve increased with increasing dose. Plasma concentrations declined rapidly in a biphasic manner, with the median terminal half-lives ranging from 5.0 to 7.6 h, independent of dose and renal function. At 25 μg/kg, the exploratory efficacy readouts for the negative and positive predictive values were, 97% and 45% for lymph nodes, and 100% and 80% for residual/locoregional disease detection, respectively.  Conclusions:   IS-002 is safe and well tolerated, and has the potential to enable intraoperative tumor detection that could not be identified using standard imaging.  Patient summary:   IS-002 is a new imaging agent that specifically targets the prostate-specific membrane antigen receptor.

The impact of this replacement on the metabolic stability and overall biological performance of [111In]In-AU-RM26-M1 was studied using a head-to-head comparison with the unmodified reference [111In]In-DOTAGA-PEG2-RM26. In vitro, the cell uptake of [111In]In-AU-RM26-M1 could be significantly reduced in the presence of a high-excess GRPR-blocker that demonstrated its specificity. The cell uptake of both radiolabeled GRPR antagonists increased with time and was superior for [111In]In-AU-RM26-M1. The dissociation constant reflected strong affinities for GRPR (500 pM for [111In]In-AU-RM26-M1).

Many natural compounds from plant origin with anti-tumor attributes have been described. Among them, capsaicin, which is the molecule responsible for the pungency in hot pepper fruits, has been reported to show antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic activities, as well as anti-proliferative properties against cancer. Thus, in this work, the potential anti-proliferative activity of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fruits from diverse varieties with different capsaicin contents (California < Piquillo < Padrón < Alegría riojana) against several tumor cell lines (lung, melanoma, hepatoma, colon, breast, pancreas, and prostate) has been investigated. The results showed that the capsaicin content in pepper fruits did not correspond with their anti-proliferative activity against tumor cell lines. By contrast, the greatest activity was promoted by the pepper tissues which contained the lowest capsaicin amount. This indicates that other compounds different from capsaicin have this anti-tumor potentiality in pepper fruits. Based on this, green fruits from the Alegría riojana variety, which has negligible capsaicin levels, was used to study the effect on the oxidative and redox metabolism of tumor cell lines from liver (Hep-G2) and pancreas (MIA PaCa-2). Different parameters from both lines treated with crude pepper fruit extracts were determined including protein nitration and protein S-nitrosation (two post-translational modifications (PTMs) promoted by nitric oxide), the antioxidant capacity, as well as the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX), among others. In addition, the activity of the NADPH-generating enzymes glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGDH), and NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP-ICDH) was followed. Our data revealed that the treatment of both cell lines with pepper fruit extracts altered their antioxidant capacity, enhanced their catalase activity, and considerably reduced the activity of the NADPH-generating enzymes. As a consequence, less H2O2 and NADPH seem to be available to cells, thus avoiding cell proliferation and possibly triggering cell death in both cell lines.""","""['Marta Rodríguez-Ruiz', 'María C Ramos', 'María J Campos', 'Inmaculada Díaz-Sánchez', 'Bastien Cautain', 'Thomas A Mackenzie', 'Francisca Vicente', 'Francisco J Corpas', 'José M Palma']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Antioxidants (Basel)""","""[]"""

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) has proven effective in early-stage androgen-sensitive disease, but prostate cancer gradually develops into an androgen-resistant metastatic state in the vast majority of patients. According to our oncogene-induced model for cancer development, senescence is a major tumor progression barrier. However, whether senescence is implicated in the progression of early-stage androgen-sensitive to highly aggressive castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) remains poorly addressed.  Methods:   Androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (C4-2B and PC-3) cells were treated or not with enzalutamide, an Androgen Receptor (AR) inhibitor. RNA sequencing and pathway analyses were carried out in LNCaP cells to identify potential senescence regulators upon treatment. Assessment of the invasive potential of cells and senescence status following enzalutamide treatment and/or RNAi-mediated silencing of selected targets was performed in all cell lines, complemented by bioinformatics analyses on a wide range of in vitro and in vivo datasets. Key observations were validated in LNCaP and C4-2B mouse xenografts. Senescence induction was assessed by state-of-the-art GL13 staining by immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy.  Results:   We demonstrate that enzalutamide treatment induces senescence in androgen-sensitive cells via reduction of the replication licensing factor CDC6. Mechanistically, we show that CDC6 downregulation is mediated through endogenous activation of the GATA2 transcription factor functioning as a CDC6 repressor. Intriguingly, GATA2 levels decrease in enzalutamide-resistant cells, leading to CDC6 stabilization accompanied by activation of Epithelial-To-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) markers and absence of senescence. We show that CDC6 loss is sufficient to reverse oncogenic features and induce senescence regardless of treatment responsiveness, thereby identifying CDC6 as a critical determinant of prostate cancer progression.  Conclusions:   We identify a key GATA2-CDC6 signaling axis which is reciprocally regulated in enzalutamide-sensitive and -resistant prostate cancer environments. Upon acquired resistance, GATA2 repression leads to CDC6 stabilization, with detrimental effects in disease progression through exacerbation of EMT and abrogation of senescence. However, bypassing the GATA2-CDC6 axis by direct inhibition of CDC6 reverses oncogenic features and establishes senescence, thereby offering a therapeutic window even after acquiring resistance to therapy.""","""['Ioanna Mourkioti', 'Aikaterini Polyzou', 'Dimitris Veroutis', 'George Theocharous', 'Nefeli Lagopati', 'Emanuela Gentile', 'Vasiliki Stravokefalou', 'Dimitris-Foivos Thanos', 'Sophia Havaki', 'Dimitris Kletsas', 'Theocharis Panaretakis', 'Christopher J Logothetis', 'Dimitris Stellas', 'Russell Petty', 'Giovanni Blandino', 'Angelos Papaspyropoulos', 'Vassilis G Gorgoulis']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""[]"""

However, there is no official data on the awareness of the population about cancer screening in Kazakhstan. In addition, there were no studies on the psycho-emotional state of the patients during the screening procedure conducted yet. The purpose of the study was to assess the potential factors of awareness and psycho-emotional state during screening for breast (BC), cervical (CC), and prostate cancers (PC) in Kazakhstan (using the example of Almaty city).  Methods:   This cross-sectional study was conducted in the period from 01/01/2017 to 05/31/2017. The study was carried out at six polyclinics in Almaty (Kazakhstan). 1 625 volunteers took part in the study. The special questionnaires were employed to assess awareness of the screening procedure and subjective feelings during screening. The survey was conducted on patients who were screened for BC (n=674 or 41.5%), CC (n=565 or 34.8%) and PC (n=386 or 23.8%). Demographic data (age, education, marital status, preferred language of communication, etc.) were collected from participants using in-depth interviews. The internal consistency of the questionnaires was analysed by determining the reliability index (Cronbach's alpha).  Results:   The mean age of screening participants was 54.6 ± 3.3 years (BC), 49.2 ± 7.3 years (CC), and 56.6 ± 5.1 years (PC) (p = 0.001). Participants in BC and CC screening had a general knowledge of the procedure (45.1 % and 59.8 % of cases, respectively). Men had no information about PC screening (76.4 % of cases, p = 0.001). On the other hand, women had no sufficient knowledge about mammography (46.4 %) and Papanicolaou (Pap) test (51.2% of cases). In 40.1 % (BC) and 41.1 % (CC) of cases, the fact of having the test was an unpleasant circumstance. However, in 59.6 % (PC) of cases, men did not have any discomfort associated with undertaking the test (p = 0.001). PC screening participants experienced no discomfort in 58.3 % of cases. At the same time, participants in BC and CC screenings experienced discomfort in 38.1 % and 42.5 % of cases, respectively (p = 0.001). Analysis of internal consistency on the questionnaire on awareness of the screening procedure showed the value of Cronbach's Alpha 0.693. The scores of subjective feelings during screening were 0.702.  Conclusions:   The study's results revealed the reliability and applicability of the questionnaires on awareness of the screening procedure and assessment of subjective feelings. Knowledge of general information about the screening program differed depending on the type of screening. Participants in BC and CC screening were more likely to be aware of the screening program than participants in PC screening. An unpleasant circumstance associated with screening test is most often considered the very fact of having the test, especially for participants in BC and CC screening. The results of this study highlight the importance of providing an information campaign to raise awareness about screening tests. In addition, the results indicate the need to provide patients with full information about the screening process, and possible risks and benefits.""","""['Alfiya Shamsutdinova', 'Botagoz Turdaliyeva', 'Shynar Tanabayeva', 'Aida Omarova', 'Timur Saliev', 'Baimakhan Tanabayev', 'Ildar Fakhradiyev']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Asian Pac J Cancer Prev""","""[]"""

Methods:   Qualitative research was conducted on 13 men who completed treatments for prostate cancer in the last 24 months. The participants were selected through purposeful sampling, and in-depth semi-structured interviews were used for data collection. Conventional content analysis was used for data analysis.  Results:   Data analysis led to the emergence of three themes. ""Living with insecurity"" describes the participants' experiences regarding what triggers FCR with two categories, including ""fear of incomplete cure"" and ""fear of cancer return."" In addition, ""struggling to cope"" with two categories, including ""psychological strategies"" and ""spiritual coping,"" presents coping strategies used by the participants for reducing FCR. Furthermore, ""trying to prevent cancer recurrence"" with two categories, ""seeking health"" and ""lifestyle modification,"" indicates coping strategies used by the participants to prevent cancer recurrence.

We identified 359 men with localized prostate cancer treated with curative EBRT at the Cross Cancer Institute between 2010-2011. The volume of seminal vesicles (SVs) treated as well as dose values were extracted. These volumes were compared to gold standard contours drawn by a trained expert based on consensus European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) contouring guidelines. Patient and tumor characteristics were extracted for these patients. Memorial Sloan Kettering prostate cancer nomogram was used to assign a predicted risk of SV involvement for each patient based on baseline tumor characteristics. In patients with a predicted risk of SV involvement greater than 15% (n = 184), 86.5% (SD = 18.6) of the base of the SVs were treated with EBRT, compared to 66.7% (SD = 32.6) for patients with a predicted risk of SV involvement less than 15% (n = 175, p < 0.0001). Similarly, the mean percentage of proximal and total SV volumes treated with EBRT was 75.6% (SD = 24.4) and 68.7% (SD = 26.0) for patients with a predicted risk of SV involvement of greater than 15%, compared to 50.3% (SD = 31.0, p < 0.0001) and 41.0% (SD = 27.8, p < 0.0001) for patients with a risk of less than 15%. The results indicate that all parts of the SVs are more likely to be contoured in men with >15% risk of SV involvement than those with <15% risk. However, radiation oncologists still contour a high percentage of SVs in men with <15% risk of SV involvement, suggesting that there may be over-treatment of SVs that increases the risk of rectal or bladder toxicity.""","""['Tanner Steed', 'Nikki Chopra', 'Jihyun Yun', 'Jordan Hill', 'Benjamin Burke', 'Sunita Ghosh', 'Brad Warkentin', 'Nawaid Usmani']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Curr Oncol""","""[]"""

Material and methods:   Patients with BCR of PCa after radical treatment with previous [18F]F-choline-PET/CT (negative or oligometastatic disease) were recruited to [18F]DCFPyL-PET/CT. Patients were classified according to: grade group, European Association of Urology classification, PSA, PSA doubling time (PSAdt) and PSA velocity (PSAvel). The overall detection rate (DR) and miTNM stage according to PROMISE criteria were assessed for both radiotracers and also correlated (Kappa). The influence of PSA and kinetics on both PET/CT (DR and miTNM) and predictive value of unfavourable kinetics on miTNM were determined. Cut-off PSA, PSAdt and PSAvel values able to predict PET/CT results were determined. Change in miTNM and treatment derived from [18F]DCFPyL information compared with [18F]F-choline were also evaluated.  Results:   We studied 138 patients. [18F]DCFPyL showed a higher DR than [18F]F-choline (64.5% versus 33.3%) with a fair agreement. [18F]DCFPyL and [18F]F-choline detected T in 33.3% versus 19.6%, N in 27.5% versus 13.8%, and M in 30.4% versus 8.7%. Both tracers' DR showed significant associations with PSA and PSAvel. Significant association was only found between miTNM and PSA on [18F]F-choline-PET/CT (p = 0.033). For [18F]F-choline and [18F]DCFPyL-PET/CT, a PSAdt cut-off of 4.09 and 5.59 months, respectively, were able to predict M stage. [18F]DCFPyL changed therapeutic management in 40/138 patients.

We addressed this persistent gap by relating mRNA to protein statistically using best-available data from quantitative proteomics-transcriptomics for 4366 genes in 369 cell lines. The approach starts with a central estimate of protein copy number and hierarchically appends mRNA-protein and mRNA-mRNA dependencies to define an optimal gene-specific model that links mRNAs to protein. For dozens of independent cell lines and primary prostate samples, these protein inferences from mRNA outmatch stringent null models, a count-based protein-abundance repository, and empirical protein-to-mRNA ratios. The optimal mRNA-to-protein relationships capture biological processes along with hundreds of known protein-protein interaction complexes, suggesting mechanistic relationships are embedded. We use the method to estimate viral-receptor abundances of CD55-CXADR from human heart transcriptomes and build 1489 systems-biology models of coxsackievirus B3 infection susceptibility. When applied to 796 RNA sequencing profiles of breast cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas, inferred copy-number estimates collectively reclassify 26% of Luminal A and 29% of Luminal B tumors. Protein-based reassignments strongly involve a pharmacologic target for luminal breast cancer (CDK4) and an α-catenin that is often undetectable at the mRNA level (CTTNA2). Thus, by adopting a gene-centered perspective of mRNA-protein covariation across different biological contexts, we achieve accuracies comparable to the technical reproducibility limits of contemporary proteomics. The collection of gene-specific models is assembled as a web tool for users seeking mRNA-guided predictions of absolute protein abundance ( http://janeslab.shinyapps.io/Pinferna ).  Significance statement:   It is easier to quantify mRNA in cells than it is to quantify protein, but proteins are what execute most cellular functions. Even though protein is synthesized from mRNA in cells, relating a cellular quantity of mRNA to a quantity of protein is challenging. Here, we bring together quantitative measures of mRNA and protein for 4366 genes in 369 different cultured cell types to build equations that predict protein abundance from the abundance of mRNAs expressed. These equations capture facets of biological regulation and work better than existing alternatives that rely on consensus values or ratios. Since mRNA measurements are more widespread than protein, this study makes new analyses possible by protein estimation from mRNA.""","""['Andrew J Sweatt', 'Cameron D Griffiths', 'B Bishal Paudel', 'Kevin A Janes']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""bioRxiv""","""[]"""

These mCRPC subtypes display increased lineage plasticity and often lack AR expression 2-5 . Here we show that neuroendocrine differentiation and castration-resistance in CRPC-NE are maintained by the activity of Nuclear Receptor Binding SET Domain Protein 2 (NSD2) 6 , which catalyzes histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). We find that organoid lines established from genetically-engineered mice 7 recapitulate key features of human CRPC-NE, and can display transdifferentiation to neuroendocrine states in culture. CRPC-NE organoids express elevated levels of NSD2 and H3K36me2 marks, but relatively low levels of H3K27me3, consistent with antagonism of EZH2 activity by H3K36me2. Human CRPC-NE but not primary NEPC tumors expresses high levels of NSD2, consistent with a key role for NSD2 in lineage plasticity, and high NSD2 expression in mCRPC correlates with poor survival outcomes. Notably, CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of NSD2 or expression of a dominant-negative oncohistone H3.3K36M mutant results in loss of neuroendocrine phenotypes and restores responsiveness to the AR inhibitor enzalutamide in mouse and human CRPC-NE organoids and grafts.

Methods:   lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA associated with PCa was downloaded and analyzed by Gene Expression Omnibus. The expression and correlation of LINC01088/miR-22/CDC6 in PCa were analyzed and verified by RT-qPCR. Dual-luciferase was used to analyze the binding between miR-22 and LINC01088 or CDC6. Cell Counting Kit-8 and Transwell were used to analyze the effects of LINC01088/miR-22/CDC6 interactions on PCa cell viability or migration/invasion ability.

Here, we showed that compounds 5e and 5f were similar to CB1 antagonists in structure, binding affinity and poses. In addition, compounds 5e-g decreased the viability of pancreatic and prostate cancer cells, albeit with cytotoxicity to HDF cells. The IC50 values for PANC1 cells were between 5.9 and 7.3 µM for compounds 5e-g. Cell cycle analysis showed that the effect of compounds 5e-g in cancer cell growth was largely due to cell cycle arrest at S-phase.

Immune checkpoint therapy is a promising treatment. However, emerging evidence suggests that exosomal programmed necrosis ligand 1 (PD-L1) directly binds to PD-1 on the surface of T cells in the drain lineage lymph nodes or neutralizes administered PD-L1 antibodies, resulting in poor response to anti-PD-L1 therapy in mCRPC.  Materials and methods:   Western blotting and immunofluorescence were performed to compare PD-L1 levels in exosomes derived from different prostate cancer cells. PC3 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and then ELISA assay was used to detect human specific PD-L1 in exosomes purified from mouse serum. The function of CD8+ T cells was detected by T cell mediated tumor cell killing assay and FACS analysis. A subcutaneous xenograft model was established using mouse prostate cancer cell RM1, exosomes with or without PD-L1 were injected every 3 days, and then tumor size and weight were analyzed to evaluate the effect of exosomal PD-L1.  Results:   Herein, we found that exosomal-PD-L1 was taken up by tumor cells expressing low levels of PD-L1, thereby protecting them from T-cell killing. Higher levels of PD-L1 were detected in exosomes derived from the highly malignant prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines. Moreover, exosomal PD-L1 was taken up by the PD-L1-low-expressing LNCaP cell line and inhibited the killing function of CD8-T cells on tumor cells. The growth rate of RM1-derived subcutaneous tumors was decreased after knockdown of PD-L1 in tumor cells, whereas the growth rate recovered following exosomal PD-L1 tail vein injection. Furthermore, in the serum of mice with PCa subcutaneous tumors, PD-L1 was mainly present on exosomes.  Conclusion:   In summary, tumor cells share PD-L1 synergistically against T cells through exosomes. Inhibition of exosome secretion or prevention of PD-L1 sorting into exosomes may improve the therapeutic response of prostate tumors to anti-PD-L1 therapy.""","""['Dameng Li', 'Xueying Zhou', 'Wenxian Xu', 'Yuxin Chen', 'Chenglong Mu', 'Xinchun Zhao', 'Tao Yang', 'Gang Wang', 'Liang Wei', 'Bo Ma']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Med""","""[]"""
