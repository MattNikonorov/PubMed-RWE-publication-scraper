Increasing evidence indicates that high expression of stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1)-mediated store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) significantly activates the calcium (Ca2+) signaling pathway and is involved in multiple steps of bone metastasis in PCa. However, the regulatory mechanism and target therapy of STIM1 is poorly defined.  Methods:   Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify tetraspanin 18 (TSPAN18) as a binding protein of STIM1. Co-IP assay was carried out to explore the mechanism by which TSPAN18 inhibits STIM1 degradation. The biological function of TSPAN18 in bone metastasis of PCa was further investigated in vitro and in vivo models.  Result:   We identified that STIM1 directly interacted with TSPAN18, and TSPAN18 competitively inhibited E3 ligase tripartite motif containing 32 (TRIM32)-mediated STIM1 ubiquitination and degradation, leading to increasing STIM1 protein stability. Furthermore, TSPAN18 significantly stimulated Ca2+ influx in an STIM1-dependent manner, and then markedly accelerated PCa cells migration and invasion in vitro and bone metastasis in vivo. Clinically, overexpression of TSPAN18 was positively associated with STIM1 protein expression, bone metastasis and poor prognosis in PCa.  Conclusion:   Taken together, this work discovers a novel STIM1 regulative mechanism that TSPAN18 protects STIM1 from TRIM32-mediated ubiquitination, and enhances bone metastasis of PCa by activating the STIM1-Ca2+ signaling axis, suggesting that TSPAN18 may be an attractive therapeutic target for blocking bone metastasis in PCa.""","""['Qianghua Zhou#', 'Xu Chen#', 'Kai Yao#', 'Yangjie Zhang#', 'Haixia He', 'Hao Huang', 'Hao Chen', 'Shengmeng Peng', 'Ming Huang', 'Liang Cheng', 'Qiang Zhang', 'Ruihui Xie', 'Kaiwen Li', 'Tianxin Lin', 'Hai Huang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""[]"""

Phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) is involved in various cancer-related processes. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism of exosomal PGAM1 in prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis remains unclear. In this study, we performed in vitro and in vivo to determine the functions of exosomal PGAM1 in the angiogenesis of patients with metastatic PCa. We performed Glutathione-S-transferase pulldown, co-immunoprecipitation, western blotting and gelatin degradation assays to determine the pathway mediating the effect of exosomal PGAM1 in PCa. Our results revealed a significant increase in exosomal PGAM1 levels in the plasma of patients with metastatic PCa compared to patients with non-metastatic PCa. Furthermore, PGAM1 was a key factor initiating PCa cell metastasis by promoting invadopodia formation and could be conveyed by exosomes from PCa cells to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, exosomal PGAM1 could bind to γ-actin (ACTG1), which promotes podosome formation and neovascular sprouting in HUVECs. In vivo results revealed exosomal PGAM1 enhanced lung metastasis in nude mice injected with PCa cells via the tail vein. In summary, exosomal PGAM1 promotes angiogenesis and could be used as a liquid biopsy marker for PCa metastasis.""","""['Jun-Qi Luo#', 'Tao-Wei Yang#', 'Jun Wu', 'Hou-Hua Lai', 'Li-Bin Zou', 'Wen-Bin Chen', 'Xu-Min Zhou', 'Dao-Jun Lv', 'Sheng-Ren Cen', 'Zi-Ning Long', 'Yi-You Mao', 'Peng-Xiang Zheng', 'Xiao-Hong Su', 'Zhi-Yong Xian', 'Fang-Peng Shu', 'Xiang-Ming Mao']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cell Death Dis""","""[]"""

To screen for potential regulatory SNPs, we designed a CRISPRi library containing 9,133 guide RNAs (gRNAs) to cover 2,166 candidate SNP loci implicated in PCa and identified 117 SNPs that could regulate 90 genes for PCa cell growth advantage. Among these, rs60464856 was covered by multiple gRNAs significantly depleted in screening (FDR < 0.05). Pooled SNP association analysis in the PRACTICAL and FinnGen cohorts showed significantly higher PCa risk for the rs60464856 G allele (p value = 1.2 × 10-16 and 3.2 × 10-7, respectively). Subsequent eQTL analysis revealed that the G allele is associated with increased RUVBL1 expression in multiple datasets. Further CRISPRi and xCas9 base editing confirmed that the rs60464856 G allele leads to elevated RUVBL1 expression. Furthermore, SILAC-based proteomic analysis demonstrated allelic binding of cohesin subunits at the rs60464856 region, where the HiC dataset showed consistent chromatin interactions in prostate cell lines. RUVBL1 depletion inhibited PCa cell proliferation and tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Gene-set enrichment analysis suggested an association of RUVBL1 expression with cell-cycle-related pathways. Increased expression of RUVBL1 and activation of cell-cycle pathways were correlated with poor PCa survival in TCGA datasets. Our CRISPRi screening prioritized about one hundred regulatory SNPs essential for prostate cell proliferation. In combination with proteomics and functional studies, we characterized the mechanistic role of rs60464856 and RUVBL1 in PCa progression.""","""['Yijun Tian', 'Dandan Dong', 'Zixian Wang', 'Lang Wu', 'Jong Y Park;PRACTICAL consortium;Gong-Hong Wei', 'Liang Wang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Hum Genet""","""['Combined CRISPRi and proteomics screening reveal a cohesin-CTCF-bound allele contributing to increased expression of RUVBL1 and prostate cancer progression.']"""

However, BCG sometimes causes local infections, such as cystitis and prostatitis or systemic infection. Because BCG infection is a rare complication of intravesical BCG instillation, the combination of an anti-tuberculous regimen and its duration of are unknown. CASE REPORT We describe 2 cases of BCG infection localized to the urinary tract. Case 1 was a 77-year-old man with BCG infection of the bladder and prostate. Combination therapy of anti-tuberculous agents with isoniazid, rifampicin, and ethambutol did not improve his symptoms, and his quality of life was significantly impaired from the symptoms of BCG infection; therefore, he underwent total resection of the bladder and prostate. Case 2 was an 84-year-old man with BCG infection of the bilateral ureter and bladder. It took 15 months for his symptoms to improve, but combination therapy with isoniazid, rifabutin, and ethambutol improved his condition completely. CONCLUSIONS Although BCG infection of the urinary tract is a rare complication, it is clinically important because it directly affects the quality of life of patients and requires a longer duration of treatment, depending on the symptoms. Tissue cultures are also difficult to culture, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. If the symptoms of BCG infection are not controlled, surgery can be necessary even if it is not a complication of a vital organ.""","""['Koko Shibutani', 'Kazuhiro Ishikawa', 'Nobuyoshi Mori']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Am J Case Rep""","""[]"""

This study investigated whether biallelic loss and HRD also occur in primary nonbreast/ovarian tumors that arise in germline BRCA1/2 carriers.  Methods:   A clinically ascertained cohort of BRCA1/2 carriers with a primary nonbreast/ovarian cancer was identified, including canonical (prostate and pancreatic cancers) and noncanonical (all other) tumor types. Whole-exome sequencing or clinical sequencing results (n = 45) were analyzed. A pan-cancer analysis of nonbreast/ovarian primary tumors from germline BRCA1/2 carriers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA, n = 73) was used as a validation cohort.  Results:   Ages of nonbreast/ovarian cancer diagnosis in germline BRCA1/2 carriers were similar to controls for the majority of cancer types. Nine of 45 (20%) primary nonbreast/ovarian tumors from germline BRCA1/2 carriers had biallelic loss of BRCA1/2 in the clinical cohort, and 23 of 73 (32%) in the TCGA cohort. In the combined cohort, 35% and 27% of primary canonical and noncanonical BRCA tumor types, respectively, had biallelic loss. High HRD scores (HRDex > 42) were detected in 81% of tumors with biallelic BRCA loss compared with 22% (P < .001) of tumors without biallelic BRCA loss. No differences in genomic profile, including mutational signatures, mutation spectrum, tumor mutational burden, or microsatellite instability, were found in primary nonbreast/ovarian tumors with or without biallelic BRCA1/2 loss.  Conclusion:   A proportion of noncanonical primary tumors have biallelic loss and evidence of HRD.

We aimed to evaluate which immune-related genes and cell types are differentially expressed in AA tumors and how immunobiology impacts prostate cancer progression. We purified nucleic acid from tumor biopsies, obtained following radical prostatectomy, from 51 patients (AA = 26, CA = 25). Gene expression was measured using the NanoString platform from which we estimated immune cell abundances and assessed differences between groups based on clinicopathologic data. Product-limit estimates determined associations with biochemical recurrence (BCR)-free and metastasis-free survival. DVL2 and KLRC2 were significantly upregulated in CA tumors and were also associated with worse disease progression. No significant differences in immune cell abundances by race were observed. Highly significant reductions in abundances of mast cells versus tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were found in men with high-grade pathologies and in men who later developed metastases. Low ratios of mast cells versus TILs were associated with worse BCR-free survival and metastasis-free survival. Although estimated immune cell abundances were not different by race, we identified genes involved in metabolism and natural killer cell functions that were differentially expressed between AA and CA tumors. Among the entire cohort, depletion of mast cells within prostatectomy tumors was characteristic of advanced disease and susceptibility to disease progression.  Significance:   Our findings demonstrate that there are immune-related genes and pathways that differ by race.

Distribution of patient age, tumor size, ENSAT (European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors) stages, and treatments were tabulated and graphically displayed, according to nine geographical registries, corresponding to the population of specific states, cities or macro areas of the US on which the data are based on. Multinomial models predicted treatment probability for each patient according to registries.  Results:   Patients count according to registries ranged from 62 to 509. Differences across registries existed for age (range 54-59 years; P=0.4), tumor size (8.5-11.0 cm; P=0.2), ENSAT stage (1-11% vs. 17-35% vs. 18-32% vs. 24-44%, in respectively ENSAT stage I, II, III, and IV), and treatment distribution (35-53% vs. 5-21% vs. 23-42%, in respectively adrenalectomy, systemic therapy, and adrenalectomy and systemic therapy combination; P=0.039). After adjustment for age, stage and year of diagnosis, clinically meaningful residual differences across registries remained for adrenalectomy (33-54%), systemic therapy (4-19%), and adrenalectomy and systemic therapy combination (20-38%). However, most variability originated from registries with smallest sample sizes.  Conclusions:   We identified important variability in ACC treatment according to SEER geographical registries, even after considering baseline patient and tumor characteristics.

Herein, we identified seven compounds simultaneously targeting CARM1 and HDAC2 through structure-based virtual screening. These compounds possessed potent inhibitory activities at the nanomolar level in vitro. Among them, CH-1 was the most active inhibitor which exhibited excellent and balanced inhibitory effects against both CARM1 (IC50 = 3.71 ± 0.11 nM) and HDAC2 (IC50 = 4.07 ± 0.25 nM). MD simulations presented that CH-1 could stably bind the active pockets of CARM1 and HDAC2. Notably, CH-1 exhibited strong anti-proliferative activity against multiple prostate-related tumour cells (IC50 < 1 µM). In vivo, assessment indicated that CH-1 significantly inhibited tumour growth in a DU145 xenograft model.

Emerging evidence indicated that pyroptosis, an immunogenic form of cell death, could trigger an anti-tumor immune microenvironment and enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying the regulation of pyroptosis signaling in prostate cancer remains unclear.  Methods:   The differential expression of human E3 ligases in prostate cancer was integratedly analyzed from five independent public datasets. Moreover, the immunohistochemistry analysis of a tissue microarray derived from prostate cancer patients confirmed the results from the bioinformatic analysis. Furthermore, prostate cancer cell lines were evaluated via the next-generation RNA sequencing to assess transcriptomic profile upon CDC20 depletion. Next, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, cycloheximide assay, immunoprecipitation, and ubiquitination assay were employed to explore the correlation and interaction between CDC20 and GSDME. Both immune-deficient and immune-competent murine models were utilized to examine the anti-tumor efficacy of CDC20 inhibition with or without the anti-PD1 antibodies, respectively. To analyze the immune microenvironment of the xenografts, the tumor tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.  Results:   The analysis of multiple prostate cancer cohorts suggested that CDC20 was the most significantly over-expressed E3 ligase. In addition, CDC20 exerted a negative regulatory effect on the pyroptosis pathway by targeting GSDME for ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis in a degron-dependent manner. Knockdown of CDC20 leads to increased GSDME abundance and a transition from apoptosis to pyroptosis in response to death signals. Furthermore, in our syngeneic murine models, we found that depletion of CDC20 significantly enhances the anti-tumor immunity by promoting the infiltration of CD8+ T lymphocytes dependent on the existence of GSDME, as well as reducing myeloid immune cells. More importantly, Apcin, a small molecular inhibitor that targets CDC20, exhibited synergistic effects with anti-PD1-based immunotherapy in murine models of prostate cancer.  Conclusions:   Overall, these findings provide new insights into the upstream regulation of GSDME-mediated pyroptosis by CDC20, which specifically interacts with GSDME and facilitates its ubiquitination in a degron-dependent manner. Importantly, our data highlight novel molecular pathways for targeting cellular pyroptosis and enhancing the effectiveness of anti-PD1-based immunotherapy.""","""['Fei Wu', 'Minglei Wang', 'Tao Zhong', 'Changyan Xiao', 'Xiaozheng Chen', 'Yiheng Huang', 'Meng Wu', 'Jinming Yu', 'Dawei Chen']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Exp Hematol Oncol""","""[]"""

SBRT aims to defer androgen deprivation and may deliver sustained biochemical failure (BF) free survival in selected patients. Little long-term data is currently available regarding the effectiveness of this approach.  Methods:   A retrospective single institution study of PSMA-PET directed SBRT without initial ADT for oligo-metachronous PCa. Median dose/fractionation was 24 Gy in 2# to bones and 30 Gy in 3# to lymph nodes. The primary endpoint was time to BF (PSA + 0.2 ug/L above nadir). Secondary endpoints included time to ADT for relapse (i.e. palliative ADT), BF defined as PSA nadir + 2 ug/L, toxicity, patterns of failure and survival. Patients were excluded if they received ADT with their SBRT, had short disease-free interval, or > 3 metastases on PSMA-PET.  Results:   103 patients treated from November-2014 to December-2019 were analysed from our prospective database. Median follow-up was 5 years. 64 patients were treated for nodal only disease, 35 bone only and 4 mixed. 15% were free of any BF at 5 years with median time to BF of 1.1 years. 32% (33/103) of patients had further curative-intent radiation treatment following their first BF after SBRT, including subsequent SBRT. Eight patients underwent potentially curative treatment for their second or third relapse. Allowing for salvage treatment, 29/103 (28%) were biochemically disease free at last follow up. At 5 years, 39% of patients had never received any ADT and 55% had not started ADT for relapse with a median time to ADT for relapse of 5.5 years. There were 2 grade 3 toxicities (rib fracture and lymphoedema), and no local failures.  Conclusion:   PSMA-PET guided SBRT for oligo-metachronous PCa recurrence in appropriately triaged patients results in excellent local control, low toxicity and over 50% ADT free at 5 years.""","""['Riche Mohan', 'A Kneebone', 'T Eade', 'E Hsiao', 'L Emmett', 'Christopher Brown', 'J Hunter', 'G Hruby']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Radiat Oncol""","""[]"""

Methods:   This cross-sectional study included 313 men with advanced PCa. A comprehensive personal and family history was obtained based on predefined questionnaires. Germline DNA sequencing was performed between 2019 and 2021 irrespective of family history, metastatic or castration status or age at diagnosis. Clinical risk scores for hereditary cancer syndromes were evaluated and a PCa-specific score was developed to assess the presence of PGVs.  Results:   PGV presence was associated with metastasis (p = 0.047) and castration resistance (p = 0.011), but not with personal cancer history or with relatives with any type of cancer. Clinical risk scores (Manchester score, PREMM5 score, Amsterdam II criteria or Johns Hopkins criteria) showed low sensitivities (3.3-20%) for assessing the probability of PGV presence. A score specifically designed for PCa patients stratifying patients into low- or high-risk regarding PGV probability, correctly classified all PGV carriers as high-risk, whereas a third of PCa patients without PGVs was classified as low risk of the presence of PGVs.  Conclusion:   Application of common clinical risk scores based on family history are not suitable to identify PCa patients with high PGV probabilities. A PCa-specific score stratified PCa patients into low- or high-risk of PGV presence with sufficient accuracy, and germline DNA sequencing may be omitted in patients with a low score.

Race and social determinants of health influence prostate cancer-specific mortality and overall survival (OS); however, in a previous trial, Black patients did not have inferior outcomes compared with White patients, possibly because of equitable access to care available in a clinical trial setting.  Objective:   To compare differences in survival outcomes of patients with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) by race in a phase 3 trial with a large proportion of Black patients.  Design, setting, and participants:   This secondary analysis of patient-level data of a prospective phase 3 randomized clinical trial included patients with newly diagnosed mCSPC enrolled between March 1, 2013, and July 15, 2017. Analysis was conducted between December 2022 and February 2023.  Interventions:   Patients receiving androgen deprivation therapy were randomized (1:1) to receive either orteronel 300 mg orally twice daily (experimental group) or bicalutamide 50 mg orally daily (control group).  Main outcomes and measures:   OS, with progression-free survival (PFS) as a secondary end point.  Results:   Among 1313 participants, 135 (10%) identified as Black and 1077 (82%) as White, with an equal racial distribution between groups.

Methods:   A total of 602 nurses engaged in oncology nursing in 6 hospitals in Hebei Province were selected by cluster sampling, and an online anonymous survey was conducted by sending questionnaires to oncology nurses from the Hebei Cancer Prevention and Control Association. The questionnaire was developed by the study team. There are 4 parts, namely general information, nurses' role and job responsibilities, knowledge of skeletal-related events (SREs) and cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL), and understanding and confidence in bone health management, for a total of 33 questions.  Results:   Thirty-seven percent of oncology nurses received training on bone health and other related contents; 40.48% of oncology nurses used domestic and foreign guidelines when managing patients with bone metastases or CTIBL. Only approximately one-third of oncology nurses had confidence in managing the side effects of bone metastases and bone modification drugs and identifying patients at risk of CTIBL and fracture; only 33.04% of oncology nurses believed that weight-bearing exercise can prevent bone loss; less than 50% of oncology nurses believed that aromatase inhibitor therapy, ovarian suppression therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and low body weight were risk factors for pathological fractures. The reasons that hindered oncology nurses from optimizing the management of patients with bone metastases and understanding the preventive measures and risk factors for bone loss mainly included lack of relevant knowledge training, lack of understanding of effective intervention measures, and lack of training and professionalism of specialized nurses, including insufficient development time and guidelines for clinical nursing practice.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of young adult human prostate and urethra identified cell populations in the prostatic urethra and collecting ducts similar in morphology and transcriptomic profile to lung club cells. We further identified club cell-like epithelial cells by scRNA-seq of prostate peripheral zone tissues. Here, we aimed to identify and spatially localize club cells in situ in the prostate, including in the peripheral zone. We performed chromogenic RNA in situ hybridization for five club cell markers (CP, LTF, MMP7, PIGR, SCGB1A1) in a series of (1) nondiseased organ donor prostate and (2) radical prostatectomy specimens from individuals with prostate cancer. We report that expression of club cell genes in the peripheral zone is associated with inflammation and limited to luminal epithelial cells classified as intermediate cells in proliferative inflammatory atrophy (PIA). Club-like cells were enriched in radical prostatectomy specimens compared to nondiseased prostates and associated with high-grade prostate cancer. We previously reported that luminal epithelial cells in PIA can rarely harbor oncogenic TMPRSS2:ERG (ERG+) gene fusions, and we now demonstrate that club cells are present in association with ERG+ PIA that is transitioning to early adenocarcinoma. Finally, prostate epithelial organoids derived from prostatectomy specimens demonstrate that club-like epithelial cells can be established in organoids and are sensitive to anti-androgen-directed treatment in vitro in terms of decreased androgen signaling gene expression signatures compared to basal or hillock cells. Overall, our study identifies a population of club-like cells in PIA and proposes that these cells play an analogous role to that of club cells in bronchiolar epithelium. Our results further suggest that inflammation drives lineage plasticity in the human prostate and that club cells in PIA may be prone to oncogenic transformation. © 2023 The Authors.

We previously profiled genomic landscapes of prostate cancer (PCa), yet the underlying causal genes with prognostic potential has not been defined. It remains unclear how a somatic genomic event cooperates with inherited germline variants contribute to cancer predisposition and progression.  Methods:   We applied integrated genomic and clinical data, experimental models and bioinformatic analysis to identify GATA2 as a highly prevalent metastasis-associated genomic amplification in PCa. Biological roles of GATA2 in PCa metastasis was determined in vitro and in vivo. Global chromatin co-occupancy and co-regulation of GATA2 and SMAD4 was investigated by coimmunoprecipitation, ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays. Tumor cellular assays, qRT-PCR, western blot, ChIP, luciferase assays and CRISPR-Cas9 editing methods were performed to mechanistically understand the cooperation of GATA2 with SMAD4 in promoting TGFβ1 and AR signaling and mediating inherited PCa risk and progression.  Results:   In this study, by integrated genomics and experimental analysis, we identified GATA2 as a prevalent metastasis-associated genomic amplification to transcriptionally augment its own expression in PCa. Functional experiments demonstrated that GATA2 physically interacted and cooperated with SMAD4 for genome-wide chromatin co-occupancy and co-regulation of PCa genes and metastasis pathways like TGFβ signaling. Mechanistically, GATA2 was cooperative with SMAD4 to enhance TGFβ and AR signaling pathways, and activated the expression of TGFβ1 via directly binding to a distal enhancer of TGFβ1. Strinkingly, GATA2 and SMAD4 globally mediated inherited PCa risk and formed a transcriptional complex with HOXB13 at the PCa risk-associated rs339331/6q22 enhancer, leading to increased expression of the PCa susceptibility gene RFX6.  Conclusions:   Our study prioritizes causal genomic amplification genes with prognostic values in PCa and reveals the pivotal roles of GATA2 in transcriptionally activating the expression of its own and TGFβ1, thereby co-opting to TGFβ1/SMAD4 signaling and RFX6 at 6q22 to modulate PCa predisposition and progression.""","""['Xiayun Yang#', 'Qin Zhang#', 'Shuxuan Li#', 'Raman Devarajan', 'Binjie Luo', 'Zenglai Tan', 'Zixian Wang', 'Nikolaos Giannareas', 'Tomasz Wenta', 'Wenlong Ma', 'Yuqing Li', 'Yuehong Yang', 'Aki Manninen', 'Song Wu', 'Gong-Hong Wei']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""J Exp Clin Cancer Res""","""[]"""

In addition to their canonical histone targets, some of these factors can modify critical transcription factors, further impacting oncogenic transcription programs. Our recent report demonstrated that LSD1 can demethylate the lysine 270 of FOXA1 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, leading to the stabilization of FOXA1 chromatin binding. This process enhances the activities of the androgen receptor and other transcription factors that rely on FOXA1 as a pioneer factor. However, the identity of the methyltransferase responsible for FOXA1 methylation and negative regulation of the FOXA1-LSD1 oncogenic axis remains unknown. SETD7 was initially identified as a transcriptional activator through its methylation of histone 3 lysine 4, but its function as a methyltransferase on nonhistone substrates remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of PCa progression. In this study, we reveal that SETD7 primarily acts as a transcriptional repressor in CRPC cells by functioning as the major methyltransferase targeting FOXA1-K270. This methylation disrupts FOXA1-mediated transcription. Consistent with its molecular function, we found that SETD7 confers tumor suppressor activity in PCa cells. Moreover, loss of SETD7 expression is significantly associated with PCa progression and tumor aggressiveness.

Methods:   SOX2 expression in prostate and breast cancer tissues and cell lines was determined by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunochemistry, followed by the investigation of pro-tumorigenic properties like cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis by gene knockdown and treatment with epigenetic modulators and ChIP.  Results:   Prostate and breast cancer tissues showed very high expression of SOX2. All cancer cell lines DU145 and PC3 (prostate) and MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (breast) exhibited high expression of SOX2. Inhibition of SOX2 drastically decreased cell proliferation and migration. Epigenetic modulators enhanced SOX2 gene expression in both cancer types. DNA methylation pattern in SOX2 promoter could not be appreciably counted for SOX2 overexpression. Activation of SOX2 gene promoter was due to very high deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K9acS10p and drastic decrease of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.

However, two randomised trials showed lower acute toxicity in prone position. Furthermore, in most patients, prone positioning reduced doses to the organs at risk. To confirm these findings, we compared toxicity outcomes, photographic assessment, and dosimetry between both positions using REQUITE data.  Methods:   REQUITE is an international multi-centre prospective observational study that recruited 2069 breast cancer patients receiving radiotherapy. Data on toxicity, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and dosimetry were collected, as well as a photographic assessment. A matched case control analysis compared patients treated prone (n = 268) versus supine (n = 493). Exact matching was performed for the use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy, boost, lymph node irradiation, chemotherapy and fractionation, and the nearest neighbour for breast volume. Primary endpoints were dermatitis at the end of radiotherapy, and atrophy and cosmetic outcome by photographic assessment at two years.  Results:   At the last treatment fraction, there was no significant difference in dermatitis (p = .28) or any HRQoL domain, but prone positioning increased the risk of breast oedema (p < .001). At 2 years, patients treated in prone position had less atrophy (p = .01), and higher body image (p < .001), and social functioning (p < .001) scores. The photographic assessment showed no difference in cosmesis at 2 years (p = .22). In prone position, mean heart dose (MHD) was significantly lower for left-sided patients (1.29 Gy vs 2.10 Gy, p < .001) and ipsilateral mean lung dose (MLD) was significantly lower for all patients (2.77 Gy vs 5.89 Gy, p < .001).  Conclusions:   Prone radiotherapy showed lower MLD and MHD compared to supine position, although the risk of developing breast oedema during radiotherapy was higher. At 2 years the photographic assessment showed no difference in the cosmetic outcome, but less atrophy was seen in prone-treated patients and this seems to have a positive influence on the HRQoL domain of body image.""","""['Vincent Vakaet', 'Pieter Deseyne', 'Renée Bultijnck', 'Giselle Post', 'Catharine West', 'David Azria', 'Celine Bourgier', 'Marie-Pierre Farcy-Jacquet', 'Barry Rosenstein', 'Sheryl Green', 'Dirk de Ruysscher', 'Elena Sperk', 'Marlon Veldwijk', 'Carsten Herskind', 'Maria Carmen De Santis', 'Tiziana Rancati', 'Tommaso Giandini', 'Jenny Chang-Claude', 'Petra Seibold', 'Maarten Lambrecht', 'Caroline Weltens', 'Hilde Janssens', 'Ana Vega', 'Maria Begoña Taboada-Valladares', 'Miguel Elías Aguado-Barrera', 'Victoria Reyes', 'Manuel Altabas', 'Sara Gutiérrez-Enríquez', 'Christel Monten', 'Hans Van Hulle', 'Liv Veldeman']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Acta Oncol""","""[]"""

Archived prostate cancer specimens were imaged with open-top light-sheet microscopy or microcomputed tomography and the resulting 3D datasets were used to train risk-stratification networks based on 5-year biochemical recurrence outcomes via MAMBA. With the 3D block-based approach, MAMBA achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 and 0.74, superior to 2D traditional single-slice-based prognostication (AUC of 0.79 and 0.57), suggesting superior prognostication with 3D morphological features. Further analyses reveal that the incorporation of greater tissue volume improves prognostic performance and mitigates risk prediction variability from sampling bias, suggesting the value of capturing larger extents of heterogeneous 3D morphology.

On the basis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a clinical cohort of tissue from benign prostate, locally advanced prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and NEPC, we developed a multi-step bioinformatics pipeline to identify NEPC-specific, overexpressed gene transcripts that encode cell surface proteins. This included the identification of known NEPC surface protein CEACAM5 as well as other potentially targetable proteins (e.g., HMMR and CESLR3). We further showed that cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 3 (CELSR3) knockdown results in reduced NEPC tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro. We provide in vivo data including laser capture microdissection followed by RNA-seq data supporting a causal role of CELSR3 in the development and/or maintenance of the phenotype associated with NEPC. Finally, we provide initial data that suggests CELSR3 is a target for T-cell redirection therapeutics.

Despite the great amount of research that has been conducted, findings are inconclusive. To provide a stronger basis for addressing the associations between depression, anxiety, and the incidence of various cancer types (overall, breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, alcohol-related, and smoking-related cancers), individual participant data (IPD) meta-analyses were performed within the Psychosocial Factors and Cancer Incidence (PSY-CA) consortium.  Methods:   The PSY-CA consortium includes data from 18 cohorts with measures of depression or anxiety (up to N = 319,613; cancer incidences, 25,803; person-years of follow-up, 3,254,714). Both symptoms and a diagnosis of depression and anxiety were examined as predictors of future cancer risk. Two-stage IPD meta-analyses were run, first by using Cox regression models in each cohort (stage 1), and then by aggregating the results in random-effects meta-analyses (stage 2).  Results:   No associations were found between depression or anxiety and overall, breast, prostate, colorectal, and alcohol-related cancers. Depression and anxiety (symptoms and diagnoses) were associated with the incidence of lung cancer and smoking-related cancers (hazard ratios [HRs], 1.06-1.60). However, these associations were substantially attenuated when additionally adjusting for known risk factors including smoking, alcohol use, and body mass index (HRs, 1.04-1.23).  Conclusions:   Depression and anxiety are not related to increased risk for most cancer outcomes, except for lung and smoking-related cancers. This study shows that key covariates are likely to explain the relationship between depression, anxiety, and lung and smoking-related cancers.

PCa is difficult to detect in its early stages, and most patients are diagnosed in the middle to late stages. At present, drug therapy for advanced PCa is still insufficient. Some patients develop drug resistance in the later stage of therapy, which leads to tumor recurrence, metastasis and even treatment failure. Therefore, it is crucial to find new and effective drugs to treat prostate cancer.  Objective:   The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-cancer effect of salidroside, an active ingredient in a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, on PCa.  Methods:   Two human PCa cell lines, PC3 and DU145, were cultured and treated with salidroside. Cell viability and proliferation ability were analyzed through CCK-8 and colony assays, and cell migration ability was detected by Transwell and Scratch assays. RT-PCR and WB were used to detected the expression levels of moleculars related to cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and AKT signaling pathway. Forthmore, we performed rescue experiments with agonist to verify the affected signaling pathway.  Results:   Salidroside inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, and migration of PCa cells. Meanwhile, apoptosis of PCa cells was enhanced. Moreover, salidroside inhibited PI3K/AKT pathway in PCa cells. The treatment of AKT agonist 740Y-P abrogated the inhibitory effect of salidroside on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Methods:   The clinical data of 96 elderly patients undergoing Leonardo's robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy in Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital from October 2021, to April 2023, were selected for retrospective analysis. Sixteen patients who had interrupted follow-up or did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded, and 80 patients were finally included. The patients were divided into group A (lung-protective strategy using routine PEEP value, n = 40) and group B (lung-protective strategy using individualized PEEP value, n = 40) on the basis of different inversion methods. The PEEP value of group A was set as 5 cmH2O, whereas that of group B was determined under the guidance of static lung compliance. The incidences of PPCs on postoperative day 7 were statistically analyzed, and the serum levels of interleukin (IL) 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 in both groups were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsordent assay (ELISA).  Results:   The incidence of pulmonary complications was obviously lower in group B than in group A on postoperative day 7 (p < 0.001). Group B had lower levels of serum IL-6 and IL-8 at the end of surgery (T1) and 12 h after surgery (T2, p < 0.001); Higher oxygenation index values 10 min after successful titration of individualized PEEP (A3), 1 h after individualized PEEP ventilation (A4), 2 h after individualized PEEP ventilation (A5), 10 min after recovery of supine position (A6), and 30 min after tracheal extubation (A7); And lower hospitalization time (all p < 0.001) than group A.

Irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitors (MAOi's) were the first class of antidepressants, thus subsequent work on drugs such as the selective MAOA inhibitor clorgyline has focussed on selectivity and increased CNS penetration. MAOA is highly expressed in high grade and metastatic prostate cancer with a proposed effect on prostate cancer growth, recurrence, and drug resistance. A Phase II Clinical Trial has demonstrated the therapeutic effects of the irreversible nonselective MAOi phenelzine for prostate cancer. However, neurologic adverse effects led to early withdrawal in 25% of the enrolled patient-population. In this work, we revised the clorgyline scaffold with the goal of decreasing CNS penetration to minimize CNS-related side effects while retaining or enhancing MAOA inhibition potency and selectivity. Using the known co-crystal structure of clorgyline bound with FAD co-factor in the hMAOA active site as a reference, we designed and synthesized a series of compounds predicted to have lower CNS penetration (logBB). All synthesized derivatives displayed favorable drug-like characteristics such as predicted Caco-2 permeability and human oral absorption, and exhibited highly selective hMAOA binding interactions. Introduction of an HBD group (NH2 or OH) at position 5 of the phenyl ring clorgyline resulted in 3x more potent hMAOA inhibition with equivalent or better hMAOB selectivity, and similar prostate cancer cell cytotoxicity. In contrast, introduction of larger substituents at this position or at the terminal amine significantly reduced the hMAOA inhibition potency, attributed in part to a steric clash within the binding pocket of the MAOA active site. Replacement of the N-methyl group by a more polar, but larger 2-hydroxyethyl group did not enhance potency. However, introduction of a polar 2-hydroxy in the propyl chain retained the highly selective MAOA inhibition and cancer cell cytotoxicity of clorgyline while reducing its CNS score from 2 to 0. We believe that these results identify a new class of peripherally directed MAOIs that may allow safer therapeutic targeting of MAOA for a variety of anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory indications.""","""['Michaela R Jacobs', 'Jennifer E Olivero', 'Hyun Ok Choi', 'Chun-Peng Liao', 'Boris A Kashemirov', 'Jonathan E Katz', 'Mitchell E Gross', 'Charles E McKenna']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Bioorg Med Chem""","""[]"""

This study comprehensively assessed ENPP2 expression in pan-cancer using bioinformatics. We analyzed the expression of ENPP2 mRNA in primary liver cancer and adjacent tissues of patients with HCC using data from the TCGA database. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to identify clinicopathological factors associated with survival, and the diagnostic value of ENPP2 expression was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We also validated our findings by performing real-time PCR on clinical liver cancer samples. Furthermore, we conducted gene set enrichment analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas dataset to gain additional insights into the biological significance of ENPP2 in HCC. High ENPP2 expression in HCC patients is associated with gender and clinical stage, and is a significant prognostic factor for worse outcomes. ENPP2 expression is an independent risk factor for progression-free and disease-specific survival in both cohorts, suggesting its potential as an HCC biomarker. ENPP2's diagnostic value in HCC patients was confirmed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which was 0.806. real-time PCR analysis validated the higher expression of ENPP2 in clinical liver cancer tissues. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways enriched in HCC patients with high ENPP2 expression, including those related to the cell cycle, MTOR and T cell receptor signaling, and phosphatidylinositol signaling systems.

Methods:   Retrospective study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) - Medicare database. Cohort included fee-for-service, African American and white men aged ≥ 66, diagnosed with localized PCa between 1998 and 2011 and their claims between 1997 and 2016.

With the development of industrialization, antimony is widely used in daily life and enters the human body through the food chain, water source, air pollution, and other channels. The risk of antimony exposure has emerged as one of the public's major health concerns. Current research on antimony shows that antimony has certain biological toxicity, and antimony exposure may be one of the carcinogenic risk factors for bladder cancer, prostate cancer (PCa), and other cancers. But the molecular mechanism of antimony exposure in PCa is still unclear. Our results showed that serum antimony levels were significantly higher in PCa patients than in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and high levels of serum antimony were associated with poorer prognosis in PCa. We demonstrate that antimony exposure promotes PCa progression in vivo and in vitro. In addition, our results also showed that low-dose antimony exposure resulted in increased GSH, increased GPX4 expression, and decreased Fe2+. Since GPX4 and Fe2+ are important molecular features in the mechanism of ferroptosis, we further found that low-dose antimony exposure can inhibit RSL3-induced ferroptosis and promote PCa proliferation. Finally, our study demonstrates that low-dose antimony exposure promotes Nrf2 expression, increases the expression level of SLC7A11, and then increases the expression of GPX4, inhibits ferroptosis, and promotes PCa progression. Taken together, our experimental results suggest that low-dose antimony exposure promotes PCa cell proliferation by inhibiting ferroptosis through activation of the Nrf2-SLC7A11-GPX4 pathway. These findings highlight the link between low-dose antimony exposure and the Nrf2-SLC7A11-GPX4 ferroptosis pathway, providing a new potential direction for the prevention and treatment of PCa.""","""['Jianxi Shi', 'Chunlei Ma', 'Zhiwen Zheng', 'Tianxiao Zhang', 'Zhaopeng Li', 'Xiaoyu Sun', 'Zhen He', 'Zhihong Zhang', 'Changwen Zhang']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Chemosphere""","""[]"""

This prevents formation of the HDAC4/NCoR1/HDAC3 complex, disrupting HIF-1α transcriptional activation and repressing MEF-2 target genes needed for adaptive survival signaling in the compromised tumor micro environment. In phase 3 clinical testing against metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer(mCRPC), TasQ (1 mg/day) increased time-to-progression, but not overall survival.  Methods:   TasQ analogs were chemically synthesized and tested for activity compared to the parental compound. These included HDAC4 enzymatic assays, qRT-PCR and western blot analyses of gene and protein expression following treatment, in vitro and in vivo efficacy against multiple prostate cancer models including PDXs, pharmacokinetic analyses,AHR binding and agonist assays, SPR analyses of binding to HDAC4 and NCoR1, RNAseq analysis of in vivo tumors, 3D endothelial sprouting assays, and a targeted kinase screen. Genetic knockout or knockdown controls were used when appropriate.  Results:   Here, we document that, on this regimen (1 mg/day), TasQ blood levels are 10-fold lower than the optimal concentration (≥2 μM) needed for anticancer activity, suggesting higher daily doses are needed. Unfortunately, we also demonstrate that TasQ is an arylhydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonist, which binds with an EC50 of 1 μM to produce unwanted off-target side effects. Therefore, we screened a library of TasQ analogsto maximize on-target versus off-target activity. Using this approach, we identified ESATA-20, which has ~10-fold lower AHR agonism and 5-fold greater potency against prostate cancer patient-derived xenografts.

A growing body of evidence suggest the involvement of the NPY system in several cancers, notably the Y5 subtype, thus acting as a relevant target for the development of radiopharmaceuticals for imaging or targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). Here, the [cPP(1-7),NPY(19-23),Ala31,Aib32,Gln34]hPP scaffold, further referred to as sY5ago, was modified with a DOTA chelator and radiolabeled with 68Ga and 111In and investigated in vitro and in vivo using the MCF-7 model. For in vivo studies, MCF-7 cells were orthotopically implanted in female nude mice and imaging with small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (μPET/CT) was performed. At the end of imaging, the mice were sacrificed. A scrambled version of sY5ago, which was also modified with a DOTA chelator, served as a negative control (DOTA-[Nle]sY5ago_scrambled). sY5ago and DOTA-sY5ago showed subnanomolar affinity toward the Y5 (0.9 ± 0.1 and 0.8 ± 0.1 nM, respectively) and a single binding site at the Y5 was identified. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-sY5ago and [111In]In-DOTA-sY5ago were hydrophilic and showed high specific internalization (1.61 ± 0.75%/106 cells at 1 h) and moderate efflux (55% of total binding externalized at 45 min). On μPET/CT images, most of the signal was depicted in the kidneys and the liver. MCF-7 tumors were clearly visualized. On biodistribution studies, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-sY5ago was eliminated by the kidneys (∼60 %ID/g). The kidney uptake is Y5-mediated. A specific uptake was also noted in the liver (5.09 ± 1.15 %ID/g vs 1.13 ± 0.21 %ID/g for [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-[Nle]sY5ago_scrambled, p < 0.05), the lungs (1.03 ± 0.34 %ID/g vs 0.20 %ID/g, p < 0.05), and the spleen (0.85 ± 0.09%ID/g vs 0.16 ± 0.16%ID/g, p < 0.05).

Arising from luminal cells of the prostatic acinus, prostate cancer is influenced by multiple cells in its microenvironment. To expand our knowledge and explore means to prevent and treat the disease, it is important to understand what drives the onset and early stages of prostate cancer. In this study, we developed an agent-based model of a prostatic acinus including its microenvironment, to allow for in silico studying of prostate cancer development. The model was based on prior reports and in-house data of tumor cells cocultured with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and protumor and/or antitumor macrophages. Growth patterns depicted by the model were pathologically validated on hematoxylin and eosin slide images of human prostate cancer specimens. We identified that stochasticity of interactions between macrophages and tumor cells at early stages strongly affect tumor development. In addition, we discovered that more systematic deviations in tumor development result from a combinatorial effect of the probability of acquiring mutations and the tumor-promoting abilities of CAFs and macrophages. In silico modeled tumors were then compared with 494 patients with cancer with matching characteristics, showing strong association between predicted tumor load and patients' clinical outcome. Our findings suggest that the likelihood of tumor formation depends on a combination of stochastic events and systematic characteristics. While stochasticity cannot be controlled, information on systematic effects may aid the development of prevention strategies tailored to the molecular characteristics of an individual patient.  Significance:   We developed a computational model to study which factors of the tumor microenvironment drive prostate cancer development, with potential to aid the development of new prevention strategies.""","""['Margot Passier', 'Maisa N G van Genderen', 'Anniek Zaalberg', 'Jeroen Kneppers', 'Elise M Bekers', 'Andries M Bergman', 'Wilbert Zwart', 'Federica Eduati']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cancer Res Commun""","""[]"""

However, acquired resistance to single agents targeting this pathway results in the development of lethal castration-resistant PCa. Combination therapy approaches represent a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced disease. Here, we explore a therapeutic strategy for PCa based on the ability of shRNAs/siRNAs to function essentially as miRNAs and, via seed sequence complementarity, induce RNA interference of numerous targets simultaneously. We developed a library that contained shRNAs with all possible seed sequence combinations to identify those ones that most potently reduce cell growth and viability when expressed in PCa cells. Validation of some of these RNAi sequences indicated that the toxic effect is associated with seed sequence complementarity to the 3' UTR of AR coregulatory and essential genes. In fact, expression of siRNAs containing the identified toxic seed sequences led to global inhibition of AR-mediated gene expression and reduced expression of cell-cycle genes. When tested in mice, the toxic shRNAs also inhibited castration-resistant PCa and exhibited therapeutic efficacy in pre-established tumors. Our findings highlight RNAi of androgen signaling networks as a promising therapeutic strategy for PCa.""","""['Joshua M Corbin', 'Constantin Georgescu', 'Lin Wang', 'Jonathan D Wren', 'Magdalena Bieniasz', 'Chao Xu', 'Adam S Asch', 'Maria J Ruiz Echevarría']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Mol Ther Nucleic Acids""","""[]"""

Its comprehensive implementation remains challenging, and underlying cardiopulmonary adaptations are poorly investigated. This randomized controlled trial examines the implementation and effects of home-based online training on cardiopulmonary variables and physical activity.  Methods:   Of screened post-surgical patients with breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer, 148 were randomly assigned (1:1) to an intervention (2 × 30 min/week of strength-endurance training using video presentations) and a control group. All patients received activity feedback during the 6-month intervention period. Primary endpoint was change in oxygen uptake after 6 months. Secondary endpoints included changes in cardiac output, rate pressure product, quality of life (EORTC QoL-C30), C-reactive protein, and activity behavior.  Results:   One hundred twenty-two patients (62 intervention and 60 control group) completed the study period. Change in oxygen uptake between intervention and control patients was 1.8 vs. 0.66 ml/kg/min (estimated difference after 6 months: 1.24; 95% CI 0.23 to 2.55; p = 0.017).

It is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths in men. Symptoms may be non-specific and may not present until the cancer has progressed. Raising awareness, knowing risk factors and symptoms and seeking early medical attention is critical for prevention and detection. The objective of this study is to assess the level of awareness of prostate cancer among male patients attending care in a urology unit in Ethiopia.  Methods:   We conducted a cross-sectional study among 241 male patients at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital from February to April 2021. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire adapted from published studies and cancer awareness measurement tools. We used EpiData V.4.6.0 and SPSS V.26 for data entry and analysis. Descriptive statistics and linear regressions were used for analyses. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis identified factors associated with prostate cancer awareness. Adjusted odd ratio (AOR) at 95% CI and p value<0.05 were considered statistically significant.  Results:   A total of 250 patients were approached, and 241 (96.4%) responded.

Contemporary management paradigms involve advanced molecular imaging and multimodal treatment with intensified prostate-directed or systemic treatment-resources more readily available at high-volume centers.  Objective:   To examine radiation facility case volume and overall survival (OS) in men with VHR prostate cancer.  Design, setting, and participants:   A retrospective cohort study was performed from November 11, 2022, to March 4, 2023, analyzing data from US facilities reporting to the National Cancer Database. Patients included men diagnosed with nonmetastatic VHR prostate cancer by National Comprehensive Cancer Network criteria (clinical T3b-T4 category, primary Gleason pattern 5, >4 cores with grade group 4-5, and/or 2-3 high-risk features) and treated with curative-intent radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy between January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2016.  Exposures:   Treatment at high- vs low-average cumulative facility volume (ACFV), defined as the total number of prostate radiotherapy cases at an individual patient's treatment facility from 2004 until the year of their diagnosis. The nonlinear association between a continuous ACFV and OS was examined through a Martingale residual plot; an optimal ACFV cutoff was identified that maximized the separation between high vs low ACFV via a bias-adjusted log rank test.  Main outcomes and measures:   Overall survival was assessed between high vs low ACFV using Kaplan-Meier analysis with and without inverse probability score weighted adjustment and multivariable Cox proportional hazards.  Results:   A total of 25 219 men (median age, 71 [IQR, 64-76] years; 78.7% White) with VHR prostate cancer were identified, 6438 (25.5%) of whom were treated at high ACFV facilities. Median follow-up was 57.4 (95% CI, 56.7-58.1) months. Median OS for patients treated at high ACFV centers was 123.4 (95% CI, 116.6-127.4) months vs 109.0 (95% CI, 106.5-111.2) months at low ACFV centers (P < .001).

Then, selected breast (MCF7), colon (SW480), and prostate (DU145) cancer cell lines were used to investigate the nicotine-induced effects mediated by α5. Using pharmacological and siRNA-based experiments, we show that α5 is essential for nicotine-induced proliferation and migration. Additionally, upon downregulation of α5, nicotine-promoted expression of EMT markers and immune regulatory proteins was impaired. Moreover, the α5 polymorphism D398N (α5SNP) caused a basal increase in proliferation and migration in the DU145 cell line, and the effect was mediated through G-protein signaling. Taken together, our results indicate that nicotine-induced cancer cell proliferation and migration are mediated via α5, adding to the characterization of α5 as a putative therapeutical target.""","""['Irida Papapostolou', 'Daniela Ross-Kaschitza', 'Florian Bochen', 'Christine Peinelt', 'Maria Constanza Maldifassi']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cells""","""[]"""

Although established as an oncogene in a variety of squamous cell carcinomas, the precise role of DCUN1D1 in prostate cancer (PCa) has not been previously explored thoroughly. Here, we investigated the role of DCUN1D1 in PCa and demonstrated that DCUN1D1 is upregulated in cell lines as well as human tissue samples. Inhibition of DCUN1D1 significantly reduced PCa cell proliferation and migration and remarkably inhibited xenograft formation in mice. Applying both genomics and proteomics approaches, we provide novel information about the DCUN1D1 mechanism of action. We identified CUL3, CUL4B, RBX1, CAND1 and RPS19 proteins as DCUN1D1 binding partners. Our analysis also revealed the dysregulation of genes associated with cellular growth and proliferation, developmental, cell death and cancer pathways and the WNT/β-catenin pathway as potential mechanisms. Inhibition of DCUN1D1 leads to the inactivation of β-catenin through its phosphorylation and degradation which inhibits the downstream action of β-catenin, reducing its interaction with Lef1 in the Lef1/TCF complex that regulates Wnt target gene expression. Together our data point to an essential role of the DCUN1D1 protein in PCa which can be explored for potential targeted therapy.""","""['Akhona Vava', 'Juliano D Paccez', 'Yihong Wang', 'Xuesong Gu', 'Manoj K Bhasin', 'Michael Myers', 'Nelson C Soares', 'Towia A Libermann', 'Luiz F Zerbini']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Cells""","""[]"""

Ribonucleotide reductase is a crucial enzyme for cell division and tumor growth. Triapine, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, has shown strong anti-tumor activity in various types of cancers. However, the effect of triapine on docetaxel-resistant (DR) human PCa cells has not been explored previously.  Aim:   This study aimed to examine the potential anti-proliferative effects of triapine in PC3-DR (docetaxel-resistant) cells.  Methods:   Cell viability was determined by the MTT test, and apoptosis and cell cycle progression were analyzed by image-based cytometer. mRNA and protein expression were assessed by RT-qPCR and western blot, respectively.  Results:   Triapine administration significantly reduced PC3 and PC3-DR cells' survival, while the cytotoxic effect was higher in PC3-DR cells. Cell death resulting from inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase was mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress, induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. The findings were supported by the upregulation of caspases, Bax, Bak, P21, P27, P53, TNF-α, FAS, and FASL, and downregulation of Bcl2, Bcl-XL, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), CDK4, cyclins, and heat shock proteins expression. According to the data, the reduction of ABC transporter proteins and NF-ĸB expression may play a role in triapine-mediated cytotoxicity in docetaxel-resistant cells.  Conclusion:   Based on our findings, triapine emerges as a promising chemotherapeutic approach for combating docetaxel-resistant prostate cancer.""","""['Riza Serttas', 'Suat Erdogan']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Anticancer Agents Med Chem""","""[]"""

Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have comprehensively elucidated the intricate characteristics of the aging microenvironment (AME) in PCa. Methods: AME regulatory patterns were determined using the NMF algorithm. Then an ageing microenvironment index (AMI) was constructed, with excellent prognostic and immunotherapy prediction ability, and its' clinical relevance was surveyed through spatial transcriptomics. Further, the drug response was analysed using the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC), the Connectivity Map (CMap) and CellMiner database for patients with PCa. Finally, the AME was studied using in vitro and vivo experiments. Results: Three different AME regulatory patterns were identified across 813 PCa patients, associated with distinct clinical prognosis and physiological pathways. Based on the AMI, patients with PCa were divided into the high-score and low-score subsets. Higher AMI score was significantly infiltrated with more immune cells, higher rate of biochemical recurrence (BCR) and worse response to immunotherapy, antiandrogen therapy and chemotherapy in PCa. In addition, we found that the combination of bicalutamide and embelin was capable of suppressing tumor growth of PCa. Besides, as the main components of AMI, COL1A1 and BGLAP act as oncogenes and were verified via in vivo and in vitro experiments. Conclusions: AME regulation is significantly associated with the diversity and complexity of TME. Quantitative evaluation of the AME regulatory patterns may provide promising novel molecular markers for individualised therapy in PCa.""","""['Chengpeng Gui', 'Jinhuan Wei', 'Chengqiang Mo', 'Yanping Liang', 'Junjie Cen', 'Yuhang Chen', 'Daohu Wang', 'Junhang Luo']""","""[]""","""2023""","""None""","""Int J Biol Sci""","""[]"""
